ABSTRACT:
EMP4 contains nine 35–amino acid PPR motifs and an N-terminal mitochondrion-targeted sequence peptide, which was confirmed by a translational EMP4–green fluorescent protein fusion that localized to mitochondria. 
RESULTS:
To experimentally determine the subcellular localization of EMP4, we generated a translational EMP4-GFP fusion construct, which was used for transient expression studies in tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) leaf epidermal cells. 
Contrary to the computer predictions, confocal laser scanning microscopy analysis of leaf samples showed in vivo colocalization of the green fluorescent signal of EMP4-GFP with Mito Tracker Orange in mitochondria
MATERIALS AND METHODS:
To generate a translational protein fusion between EMP4 and GFP, the full-length ORF of emp4 was amplified by PCR and introduced into the binary vector pGWB5 (a gift from Tsuyoshi Nakagawa, Shimane University) by GATEWAY in vitro site-specific recombination (Invitrogen).
