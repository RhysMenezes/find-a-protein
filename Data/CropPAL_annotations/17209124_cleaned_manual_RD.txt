ABSTRACT:
To define the endocytic pathway in plants, we cloned the rice (Oryza sativa) homolog of animal SCAMP1 and generated transgenic tobacco BY-2 cells expressing yellow fluorescent protein (YFP)–SCAMP1 or SCAMP1-YFP fusions. 
Confocal immunofluorescence and immunogold electron microscopy studies demonstrated that YFP-SCAMP1 fusions and native SCAMP1 localize to the plasma membrane and mobile structures in the cytoplasm of transgenic BY-2 cells. 
Drug treatments and confocal immunofluorescence studies demonstrated that the punctate cytosolic organelles labeled by YFP-SCAMP1 or SCAMP1 were distinct from the Golgi apparatus and PVCs
RESULTS:
First, a fusion protein approach in transgenic tobacco BY-2 cells was used. Because the rice SCAMP1 did not contain a predicted signal peptide (Figure 1), we made both N-terminal and C-terminal fusions of SCAMP1 to YFP under the control of the 35S constitutive promoter and 3′ NOS terminator (Figure 2A ).
The resulting chimeric constructs, SCAMP1-YFP and YFP-SCAMP1, were then inserted into tobacco BY-2 cells via Agrobacterium tumefaciens–mediated transformation.
Confocal immunofluorescence microscopy was first performed to determine the subcellular localization of both SCAMP1-YFP and YFP-SCAMP1 fusions in tobacco BY-2 cells.
These results demonstrated that both YFP-SCAMP1 and SCAMP1-YFP fusions localized to the PM of transgenic BY-2 cells and demonstrate that neither N-terminal nor C-terminal fusion affects this localization.
This finding indicates that the organelles labeled by SCAMP1-YFP may represent endosomal compartments in BY-2 cells
As demonstrated in Figure 6, on the basis of differential BFA and wortmannin treatments, the novel organelles in BY-2 cells labeled by SCAMP1-YFP or YFP-SCAMP1 were neither Golgi nor PVC.
Tobacco BY-2 cell lines expressing the cis-Golgi marker Man1-GFP (CITATION), the trans-Golgi marker GONST1-YFP (CITATION; CITATION), and the PVC marker GFP-BP-80 (CITATION) were used.
Thus, SCAMP1-YFP–containing organelles represent either an early endosomal compartment or a recycling endosome in tobacco BY-2 cells.
MATERIALS AND METHODS:
First, full-length SCAMP1 sequences were cloned into pBI121. Two primers (forward primer, 5′-GGGGGATCCGCGGGGCGCTACGACAGCACC-3′; reverse primer, 5′-GGGGAGCTCTTAAAAAGCTGCCCGCATAGC-3′) were used to amplify the full-length rice SCAMP1 cDNA sequences for YFPSCAMP1K, whereas two other primers (forward, 5′-GGGGGATCCATGGCGGGGCGCTACGACAGC-3′; reverse, 5′-GGGGAGCTCAAAAGCTGCCCGCATAGCACC-3′) were used to amplify the full-length rice SCAMP1 cDNA sequences for SCAMP1YFPK. 
Second, the YFP sequence was amplified by PCR using pGONST1-YFP
