confocal analysis of oocytes expressing _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ n alone or gfp plus showed that the amount of _BLANKP_ _BLANKM_ p present in the _BLANKL_ e was significantly greater in coexpressing cells .,Y
to generate the two gfp vectors gfp and _PROTEIN_ m _METHOD_ gfp and gfp cdnas were amplified by pcr using the and sgfp plasmids respectively as templates and the specific p _BLANKP_ _BLANKM_ and thus incorporating a bamhi site at both ends .,Y
we first determined whether the presence of _METHOD_ gfp reporter at the c terminus _PROTEIN_ affected the positive cooperative effect observed previously .,Y
all pcr amplified fragments containing bamhi and/or bglii sites at both ends were subcloned into the bglii site of a derived bs vector generating plasmids _PROTEIN_ z _METHOD_ gfp pxgfp and .,Y

confocal analysis of oocytes expressing _BLANKP_ _BLANKM_ n alone or gfp plus showed that the amount of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ p present in the _LOCATION_ e was significantly greater in coexpressing cells .,Y
the data showed a significant increase in the amount of gfp in the membranes of oocytes coexpressing gfp and compared with controls indicating that interacts with gfp to increase the amoun _PROTEIN_ _BLANKM_ _METHOD_ gfp in the oo _LOCATION_ brane .,Y
because experiments on the detection of in vivo labeled proteins in purified oocyte plasma membranes did not give clear results we studied the plasma membrane localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ ein fusion protein .,Y
