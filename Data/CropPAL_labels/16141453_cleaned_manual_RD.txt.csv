to confirm this nuclear localization we made a fusion between t _METHOD_ ein gene a _PROTEIN_ this construct was transiently expressed under the control of the promoter and the nos terminator,Y
the gfp signal coincided with an rfp signal driven by the nls rfp protein indicating _PROTEIN_ t _LOCATION_ uclear protein and can function as a transcriptional regulator .,Y
when chimeric molecules were introduced into arabidopsis protoplasts prepared from whole seedlings we found that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ gfp was indeed localized to _LOCATION_ cleus,Y
as a positive control the previously characteri _LOCATION_ lear localization signal of _PROTEIN_ protein was fused _METHOD_ tein and the fusion protein was expressed using the same regulatory elements,Y
the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ n fusion protein was localized to the _LOCATION_ s .,Y
