to experimentally determine the subcellular localization of we generated a translation _PROTEIN_ m _METHOD_ gfp fusion construct which was used for transient expression studies in tobacco leaf epidermal cells .,Y
contrary to the computer predictions confocal laser scanning microscopy analysis of leaf samples showed in vivo colocalization of the green fluorescent signal _PROTEIN_ e _METHOD_ gfp with mito tracker orange _LOCATION_ dria,Y
contains nine amino acid ppr motifs and an n terminal mitochondrion targeted sequence peptide which was confirmed by a translational _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ n fusion that localized to _LOCATION_ a .,Y
