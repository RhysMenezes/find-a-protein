T14	Irrelevant 1579 2401	anti-PGL35 (At4g04020), anti-TOC75 (At3g46740) and anti-CAB (chlorophyll a/b binding protein) antibodies as plastoglobule, envelope and thylakoid markers, respectively. The results demonstrated the separation of plastoglobules (fractions 1–7) from envelope (in fractions 11–15) and thylakoid membranes (predominantly in fractions 11–21). PGL34-YFP, detected by anti-GFP antibodies, co-distributed with PGL35. Moreover, globular fluorescent structures were highly abundant in low-density fractions (Fig.  5C ), demonstrating targeting of the recombinant protein to plastoglobules. SDS-PAGE analysis of the low-density fractions revealed a prominent band with an apparent mass of 55 kDa consistent with the predicted mass of PGL34-YFP (28.3, processed PGL34 + 26.9, YFP). This band was recognized by anti-GFP antibodies (Fig

The PCR product was ligated in the  Nco I site of either pCL60 [ 40 ] or pCL62 [ 14 ], resulting in C-terminal GFP or CFP fusions respectively, under the control of the CaMV 35S promoter and the nos terminator. Partial  PGL34  sequences were amplified from pCL60-PGL34 using a forward primer containing a  Xba I site (5'-gct cta gaA TGG CAT TGA

T17	Irrelevant 3985 4777	Transient and stable A. thaliana transformation Transient transformation of protoplasts was done using the polyethylene glycol method as described in ref. [ 41 ], but reducing cellulase and macerozyme (Serva) concentrations to 1% and 0.25% (w/v) respectively. Fluorescence in transformed protoplasts was monitored 48 h after transformation by confocal laser scanning microscopy. GFP was detected using the FITC (488 nm) laser line from a LEICA TCS 4D microscope (LEICA Microsystems). For double fluorescent experiments, CFP and YFP were detected sequentially with a LEICA SP2 AOBS microscope, using 458 and 514 nm laser lines and 460–510 nm and 520–588 nm detection windows, respectively. Chlorophyll autofluorescence was monitored using either 594 nm or TRITC (568 nm) excitation wavelengths

Proteins were stained with amidoblack (= naphthol blue black) for protein detection or used for immunodetection. Blots were probed with anti-GFP (gift from Dr. E. Schäfer) and anti-CAB (kindly provided by Dr. K. Apel) sera, or with affinity-purified antibodies specific for TOC75 [ 46 ] and PGL35 [ 14 ]. For quantification, chemiluminescent immunoblot signals were analysed using a Bio-Rad
