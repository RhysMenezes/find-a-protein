ABSTRACT:
Abstract Vascular tissues are very important for providing both mechanical strength and long‐distance transport. The molecular mechanisms of regulation of vascular tissue development are still not fully understood. In this study we identified ANAC005 as a membrane‐associated NAC family transcription factor that regulates vascular tissue development. Reporter gene assays showed that ANAC005 was expressed mainly in the vascular tissues. Increased expression of ANAC005 protein in transgenic  Arabidopsis  caused dwarf phenotype, reduced xylem differentiation, decreased

ANAC005 localizes to the cell membrane through its C‐terminus To determine the subcellular localization of ANAC005, we made an ANAC005‐GFP (green fluorescent protein) fusion protein construct, driven by the Cauliflower mosaic virus ( CaMV)  35S promoter, and transformed it into  Nicotiana benthamiana . In the epidermal cells of  Nicotiana benthamiana  transformed with  35S::GFP , GFP fluorescence was visible in both nucleus and cytoplasm (Figure  2 B). By contrast, the ANAC005‐GFP fluorescence was only detected at the plasma membrane (Figure  2 C, D). Protein structure analysis showed that the N‐terminal of ANAC005 has a NAM domain including A, B, C, D and E motifs; its C‐terminus is a putative
using the TopPred‐v2 program, and identified a putative transmembrane motif (TM motif) in the middle region (aa268‐288). In order to test whether the putative TM motif determines the localization of ANAC005, we made several truncated ANAC005 proteins fused with GFP protein (Figure  2 E–I). When expressed in  Nicotiana benthamiana  driven by the CaMV 35S promoter, full‐length ANAC005‐GFP was localized exclusively at the plasma membrane (Figure  2 C). In contrast, ANAC005(1‐272)‐GFP (with deletion of C‐terminal 90 amino acids), ANAC005(1‐302)‐GFP (with deletion of C‐terminal 60 amino acids), ANAC005(1‐332)‐GFP (with deletion of C‐terminal 30 amino acids), and ANAC005(1‐342)‐GFP (with deletion of C‐terminal 20 amino acids) were all localized in the nucleus (Figure  2 E–H). However, deletion of the C‐terminal 10 amino acids resulted in localization in both nucleus and plasma membrane (Figure  2 I). These results show that C‐terminal 20 amino acids of ANAC005 play an important role in its localization of to the plasma membrane, whereas the N‐terminal region specifies nuclear localization.

MATERIALS AND METHODS:
MATERIALS AND METHODS Plant material and growth   Arabidopsis thaliana  ecotype Columbia‐0, and transgenic plants obtained in this study were grown at 22°C under white light (16‐h light/8‐h dark cycles) either on half‐strength MS medium or in the soil.
gene sequence was amplified by PCR and ligated into pENTR TM /SD/D‐TOPO vector, and then ligated into pMDC163 and C3 by recombinant clone. The primer sequence used was 5′‐ CACC AGTATCACAACTATGGGTCTGACT‐3′ and 5′‐TGTTCTTAGGTGAATTTTCTTGAC‐3′; 5′‐ CACC AGTATCACAACTATGGGTCTGACT‐3′ and 5′‐CTATGTTCTTAGGTGAATTTTCTTGAC‐3′.
