ABSTRACT:
a metalloid that is essential for plant growth but is toxic when present in excess. Arabidopsis BOR1 is a borate exporter, facilitating B translocation from root to shoot under limited-B conditions. BOR1 shows stele side polar localization in the plasma membrane of various root cells, presumably to support B translocation toward the stele. BOR1 is degraded under high-B supply through vacuolar sorting via ubiquitination at the K590 residue to prevent the accumulation of B to a toxic level in shoots.
RESULTS:
lines were ~1.1 [BOR1-GFP-HPT L1, 1.13 ± 0.06; L6, 1.12 ± 0.04; BOR1(K590A)-GFP-HPT L8, 1.07 ± 0.10; L12, 1.12 ± 0.07; mean ± SD,  n  = 60]. These results demonstrate that BOR1-GFP-HPT and BOR1(K590A)-GFP-HPT localize on the plasma membrane with weak polarity in epidermal cells. Figure 2 Polar localization of BOR1-GFP-HPT . Transgenic plants expressing BOR1-GFP-HPT were grown on solid medium containing 0.3 μM boric acid for 3 days.  (A)  BOR1-GFP-HPT in epidermal cells of the
). The Casparian strip also functions as a membrane diffusion barrier to separate two domains of the plasma membrane in the endodermis (Alassimone et al.,  2010 ). In contrast to the weak polar localization in other cell types, BOR1-GFP-HPT was exclusively localized on the plasma membrane of the stele side domain in the mature endodermis (Figure  2B ), as was shown for BOR1-GFP (Takano et al.,  2010 ). This was evidenced by the absence of GFP staining in the outer halves of transverse (apical and basal) plasma membranes (Figure  2B , arrowheads). In contrast, propidium iodide, a membrane impermeable dye, stained only the soil side of endodermal cells when applied from outside the roots. Taken together, BOR1-GFP-HPT showed weak stele-side polarity in the root tip cells but clear polarity in mature endodermal cells. B-dependent vacuolar sorting was
pathway. Transgenic plants were transferred from a low to sufficient boric acid condition (0.3–100 μM) for 3 h and GFP fluorescence was observed in root epidermal cells (Figures  3A,B ). BOR1-GFP-HPT disappeared, while BOR1(K590A)-GFP-HPT stably accumulated in the plasma membrane. The GFP fluorescence intensities of BOR1-GFP-HPT in the L1 and L6 lines decreased to 23 and 20%, respectively, whereas those of BOR1(K590A)-GFP-HPT in the L8 and L12 lines remained at 87 and 96%, respectively (Figure  3C ). Dotty structures containing BOR1-GFP-HPT were detected after sufficient B supply for 1.5 h (Figure  3D ). The dots co-localized with FM4-64, which stains the plasma membrane and membranes in the endocytic pathway (Figure  3D ). These results suggest that BOR1-GFP-HPT was internalized into endosomes from the plasma membrane under high-B conditions dependent on K590, similar to the case of BOR1-GFP (Takano et al.,  2005 ,  2010 ; Kasai et al.,  2011 ). We also grew transgenic plants on a medium containing 3000 μM boric acid for 5 days (Figures  3E,F ). BOR1-GFP-HPT was detectable weakly in root tips and scarcely in leaf epidermis under this excess-B condition, while BOR1(K590A)-GFP-HPT was stably accumulated on the plasma membrane in root cells and leaf epidermal cells (Figures  3E,F ). Taken together, these data indicate that BOR1-GFP-HPT undergoes normal degradation by B-dependent endocytosis, while BOR1(K590A)-GFP-HPT stably accumulates in various cells under control of the UBQ10 promoter.

degradation (Figure  3E ). Taken together, ubiquitous expression of BOR1-GFP-HPT variants resulted in higher B translocation into shoots and also rendered an ability to withstand high-B concentrations. It is likely that the stable accumulation of BOR1(K590A)-GFP-HPT in the plasma membrane prevented B accumulation in the sensitive cytosol by B exclusion to the leaf apoplast, thereby supporting the growth of shoots under excess-B conditions.

MATERIALS AND METHODS:
2 days at 4°C and then at 22°C under a 16-h-light/8-h-dark cycle in a growth chamber. The shoot area was measured on the pictures using the color-range selection tool in photoshop CS5 (Adobe). Plasmid construction Fragments of  proUBQ10, BOR1-GFP, BOR1(K590A)-GFP , and  HPT - NosT  were amplified by PCR using pWaveR131 (Geldner et al.,  2009 ), a plasmid containing BOR1-GFP (Takano et al.,  2005 ), pKKF065 (Kasai et al.,  2011 ), and pGWB505 (Nakagawa et al.,  2007 ), respectively, as templates. The primers used were as follows: for  ProUBQ10 , 5′-atgattacgaattcgagtctagctcaacagagctt-3′ and 5′-aaaagtctcttccatggctgttaatcagaaaaactc-3′; for  BOR1-GFP  and  BOR1(K590A)-GFP , 5′-atgattacgaattcgcacgacgttgtaaaacgacg-3′ and 5′-ttcaggctttttcatctt gtacagctcgtccatgc-3′; for  HPT-NosT , 5′-gacgagctgtac aagatgaaaaagcctgaactcac-3′ and 5′-ggccagtgccaagct ctattcctttgccctcgg-3′. The PCR products containing  ProUBQ10, BOR1-GFP  or  BOR1(K590A)-GFP  and  HPT-NosT  were cloned into the  Sac I and  Hin dIII sites of pMDC123 using an In-Fusion HD Cloning Kit (Takara), resulting in pSW13 and pSW14, respectively. The inserted DNA fragments were confirmed by
bialaphos-resistant T1 plants were transferred onto solid media supplemented with 0.3 μM boric acid and grown for 4–6 days. We then observed GFP fluorescence in roots and shoots under an epifluorescence microscope and selected 11 and 12 plants expressing BOR1-GFP-HPT and BOR1(K590A)-GFP-HPT, respectively, with relatively strong GFP fluorescence intensities. In the T2 progenies of the T1 plants, segregation of hygromycin resistance was examined, and six lines each that were expected to carry a single T-DNA insertion were selected. In the T3 progenies of the T2 plants, segregation of hygromycin resistance was examined, and three lines each were established as homozygous plants. Three lines of each variant (lines 1, 3, and 6 for BOR1-GFP-HPT and 4, 8, and 12 for BOR1(K590A)-GFP-HPT) were used for expression and growth analyses and two lines of each variant (lines 1 and 6 for BOR1-GFP-HPT and 8 and 12 for BOR1(K590A)-GFP-HPT) with good germination rates in the T3 generation were used for determination of B concentrations. Imaging analysis Laser scanning confocal microscopy was performed on a Leica TCS SP8 (Leica Microsystems) equipped with an HCPL APO CS2 x20 water immersion
10 mg ml −1  stock solution in water. Plants were transferred from solid to liquid medium containing the dye or inhibitors and incubated at room temperature. Quantification of polar localization and B-dependent vacuolar sorting The polar localizations of BOR1-GFP-HPT and BOR1(K590A)-GFP-HPT were determined by a method described previously (Wakuta et al.,  2015 ). The polarity index is a ratio of fluorescence intensity at the stele side and soil side halves of transverse (apical and basal) plasma membranes in the
was used to stain the plasma membrane. The polarity index was calculated as the ratio of GFP fluorescence intensity to that of FM4-64 fluorescence at the stele side divided by that at the soil side. The B-dependent degradation of BOR1-GFP-HPT and BOR1(K590A)-GFP-HPT was examined by quantification of GFP fluorescence. The GFP and FM4-64 fluorescence signals were obtained using laser scanning confocal microscopy (Leica TCS SP8). The intensity of GFP fluorescence in the plasma membrane stained by FM4-64 was measured. Image J

The residues were dissolved in 2% nitric acid and filtered before analysis.  11 B concentrations in the samples were determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ELAN, DRC-e; Perkin-Elmer). Total B concentrations in the sample were calculated based on natural abundance of B isotopes ( 11 B: 10 B = 80.1:19.9). Previous studies indicated that the ratio of B isotopes does not change during the
