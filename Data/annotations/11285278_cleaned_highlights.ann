This fragment was inserted into the BamHI site in front of a soluble-modified GFP (EMBL/GenBank/DDBJ accession number U70495) ( Davis and Vierstra 1996 ) cassette, psmGFP (stock number CD3-326;  Arabidopsis  Biological Resource Center) containing GFP and a  nos  terminator, in the pBJ97 shuttle vector (empty vector obtained from Bart Janssen, The Horticulture and Food Research Institute, Auckland, New Zealand via John Bowman, University of California at Davis, Davis, CA).
