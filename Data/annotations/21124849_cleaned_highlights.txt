ABSTRACT:
subcellular location of the identified proteins, we developed a new method, PFANTOM ( p lant protein  fa mily i n formation-based predic to r for endo m embrane), which was shown to perform better for proteins in the endomembrane system than other available prediction methods. Based on the combined approach
RESULTS:
prediction (PFANTOM), all predictors by SUBA database, and WoLF PSORT. NC, nucleus; MT, mitochondrion; V, vacuole; PX, peroxisome; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; GO, Golgi apparatus; CT, cytosol; PM, plasma membrane; PL, plastid; EX, extracellular.

be located in nucleus, Golgi apparatus, and plasma membrane ( Table 2 ). Thirteen of the Arabidopsis proteins have not previously been examined for their intracellular distribution, whereas the remaining three proteins (ROP7, RIC2, RIC4) have been reported in fluorescent fusion protein experiments to be located in plasma membrane  [39] ,  [40]  and were included as positive controls. For all 16 proteins the intracellular localization was determined by transiently expressing YFP-fusion
we also predicted localization with publically available web-based algorithms ( Table 2 ). As predicted by PFANTOM, two transcription factors, bHLH protein (AT5G48560;  Figure 3B ) and SND1 (AT1G32770;  Figure 3C ) showed the YFP signal in nucleus. AT3G18660 (PGSIP1;  Figure 3G ), AT4G33330 (PGSIP3;  Figure 3H ), AT5G01360 (DUF231 protein;  Figure 3I ), and AT2G38320 (DUF231 protein;  Figure 3J ) showed the YFP signal in small, moving, and oval dots very similar to what was seen with the Golgi marker (ST-tmd-GFP;  Figure 3D ), and clearly different from the ER marker (GFP-HDEL;  Figure 3F ), which showed typical network pattern. We selected PGSIP1 and PGSIP3, which were both predicted by PFANTOM to be Golgi localized, although PGSIP1 has been reported to be a chloroplast protein  [41]  and the
which belong to a large family of proteins, several of which are known to play a role in cell wall structure  [42] . For the Plasma membrane and/or extracellular localized proteins, YFP fusion proteins of GH19 family and GPI anchored proteins such as AT3G16920 (CTL2;  Figure 3K ), AT5G03170 (FLA11;  Figure 3L ), AT5G60490 (FLA12;  Figure 3M ), AT5G15630 (COBL4, IRX6;  Figure 3N ),
Figure 3P ), AT1G27380 (RIC2;  Figure 3Q ), AT5G16490 (RIC4;  Figure 3R ), AT5G45970 (ROP7;  Figure 3S ) showed the YFP signals as a single layer surrounding the cytoplasm identical to what was observed with a plasma membrane marker (pm-rk;  Figure 3E ). Interestingly, CTL2 and FLA11 show oval dots in addition to the plasma membrane signal. These dots were larger than for Golgi and we are uncertain what they represent. The YFP signal of AT2G45890 (RopGEF4;  Figure 3T ) belonging to the GEF family, which is recruited to lipid rafts for small GTPase activation  [43] ,  [44]  was
 [79] , TargetP.1  [80] , and WoLFPSORT  [81] . Pfam was the prediction method described in this study, and experimental data are shown in  Figure 5 . NC, nucleus; MT, mitochondrion; V, vacuole; PX, peroxisome; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; GO, Golgi apparatus; CT, cytosol; PM,
MATERIALS AND METHODS:
expression of the N-terminal YFP fusion proteins under the control of 35S promoter were constructed via LR-reaction using the corresponding Entry clones. The full-length genes were cloned into the destination vectors pEarleyGate 101  [73] . Marker proteins for ER (GFP-HDEL), Golgi (STtmd-GFP), and plasma membrane (pm-rk) have been described previously  [74] ,  [75] . The gene encoding p19 protein from tomato bushy stunt virus was used to suppress gene silencing. All vectors were used to transform  Agrobacterium tumefaciens
