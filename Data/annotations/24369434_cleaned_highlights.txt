ABSTRACT:
Correct positioning of membrane proteins is an essential process in eukaryotic organisms. The plant hormone auxin is distributed through intercellular transport and triggers various cellular responses. Auxin transporters of the PIN-FORMED (PIN) family localize asymmetrically at the plasma membrane (PM) and mediate the directional transport of auxin between cells. A fungal toxin, brefeldin A (BFA), inhibits a subset of guanine nucleotide exchange factors for ADP-ribosylation factor small GTPases (ARF GEFs) including GNOM, which plays a major role in
PIN1–green fluorescent protein (GFP) as well as development is hypersensitive to BFA. We found that in  bex1  a member of the  ARF1  gene family,  ARF1A1C , was mutated. ARF1A1C localizes to the  trans -Golgi network/early endosome and Golgi apparatus, acts synergistically to BEN1/MIN7 ARF GEF and is important for PIN recycling to the PM. Consistent with the developmental importance of PIN proteins, functional interference with ARF1 resulted in an impaired auxin response gradient and various developmental defects
RESULTS:
). Our result is thus consistent with previously published data and indicates a clear biological relevance of ARF1A1C function in PIN protein trafficking. ARF1A1C co-localizes with multiple ARF GEFs In Arabidopsis root epidermal cells, ARF1A1C–GFP co-localizes with  trans -Golgi network (TGN)/early endosome (EE) and Golgi apparatus markers ( Xu and Scheres 2005 ,  Tanaka et al. 2009 ). To examine the subcellular localization of ARF1A1C in more detail, we performed immunolabeling experiments
Partial co-localization of ARF1 with GNOM–GFP suggests that some population of ARF1A1C localizes to GNOM–GFP-labeled compartments, which might represent recycling endosomes. In addition, as BEN1 and GNL1 mainly localize to the TGN/EE ( Tanaka et al. 2009 ) and Golgi apparatus ( Richter et al. 2007 ,  Teh and Moore 2007 ), respectively,
localizes to intracellular compartments including the TGN/EE and Golgi apparatus, which are labeled with these ARF GEFs.  Fig. 3 ARF1A1C partially co-localizes with multiple ARF GEFs.

Average values and the standard deviation of the correlation coefficient are indicated. Consistently, immunostaining experiments confirmed that ARF1A1C–GFP co-localizes with MIN7/BEN1 and a Golgi marker SEC21/γ-COP ( Fig. 4 A;  Supplementary Fig. S3 ). Notably, ARF1A1C did not co-localize with anti-BiP staining, which labels the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) ( Supplementary Fig. S3 ). When moderately expressed, ARF1 L34F –GFP also co-localized with MIN7/BEN1 and SEC21/γ-COP, but not with BiP, suggesting that L34F mutation did not abolish its native subcellular localization ( Fig. 4 A;  Supplementary Fig.
and Golgi apparatus but overexpression of the mutated protein interfered with ARF1-regulated intracellular trafficking and caused severe developmental defects.

MATERIALS AND METHODS:
Materials and Methods Plant materials, genetic screening and phenotypic analysis The following  Arabidopsis thaliana  mutants and transgenic lines have been described previously:  PIN1-GFP  ( Benková et al. 2003 ),  ben1-1 ;  PIN1-GFP  ( Tanaka et al. 2009 ),  DR5rev::GFP  ( Friml et al. 2003b ),  PIN2-GFP; eir1  ( Xu and Scheres 2005 ),  pARF1 :: ARF1-GFP  ( Xu and Scheres 2005 ),  UAS::ARF1 WT  UAS::ARF1 Q71L  ( Xu and Scheres 2005 ),  HSP::ARF1 WT -GFP ,  HSP::ARF1 Q71L -YFP ,  HSP::ARF1 T31N -CFP  ( Xu and Scheres 2005 ),  WOX5::GFP  ( Blilou et al. 2005 ), ACT RPS5A ( Weijers et al. 2003 ),  GNOM-GFP  ( Geldner et al. 2003 ) and  GNL1-YFP  ( Richter et al. 2007 ,  Teh and Moore 2007 ). Plants were grown as described previously ( Tanaka et al. 2009 ). For genetic screening, M 2  seedlings, harboring  PIN1-GFP  descending from approximately 1,200 M 1  plants, were treated with 50–100 µM BFA for 16–20 h. Approximately 39,200 M 2  seedlings were inspected by epifluorescence microscopy.  PIN2-GFP; eir1  was introduced into the  bex1  mutant by genetic crossing.  DR5rev::GFP  and  WOX5::GFP  were introduced into the ACT RPS5A line by genetic crossing. Measurements of root length and clearing of embryos were performed as described previously ( Tanaka et al. 2007 ,  Tanaka et al. 2009 ). Chemical treatment, immunodetection
anti-PIN1 (1 : 400; Santa Cruz sc-27163), rabbit anti-PIN2 (1 : 1,000) ( Abas et al. 2006 ), rabbit anti-ARF1A1C (1: 1,000; agrisera AS08325), rabbit anti-SEC21 (1 : 1,000, agrisera AS08327), rabbit anti-BiP2 (1 : 1,000, agrisera AS09481), mouse anti-GFP (1 : 1,000; Roche 11 814 460 001), Alexa 488-conjugated secondary anti-mouse (1116 : 6 : 6 : 00; Invitrogen A11029), Cy3-conjugated secondary anti-rabbit (1 : 600; Sigma C2306) and DyLight 649-conjugated secondary anti-goat (1 : 400; Jackson Immuno Research 705-495-147) antibodies. For detection of GFP in the vacuole, seedlings were kept in darkness for 5 h to suppress degradation of GFP ( Tamura et al. 2003 ,  Kleine-Vehn et al. 2008b ). Fluorescence signals were imaged using Olympus FV1000, Carl Zeiss LSM5 exciter or LSM710 confocal microscopes. For quantification of intracellular PIN1–GFP accumulation, the number of agglomerated PIN1–GFP signals (cross-sectional area >1 µm 2 ) in each root vascular cell was scored using imageJ software (National Institute of Health, USA). At least 87 cells from each treatment were analyzed. For co-localization studies, confocal images of root epidermal
(prepared with 0.5% Triton X-100 and 0.1% Tween-20 instead of 0.1% Triton X-100) and equal amounts of extracts (20 µg) were separated by SDS–PAGE (11% acrylamide). Antibodies were diluted as follows: rabbit anti-ARF1A1C (1 : 1,000; agrisera AS08325), mouse anti-GFP antibody (1 : 1,000; Roche 11 814 460 001), anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase (HRP; 1 : 5,000; GE NA 934VS) and anti-mouse HRP (1 : 2,000; GE NA 931VS). Molecular cloning of the  BEX1  gene and DNA construction
bex1  mutant with a Landsberg  erecta  ecotype. For mapping, we selected  bex1  homozygous and segregating wild-type plants based on the phenotypes at the F 2  and/or F 3  generations by inspecting BFA-hypersensitive PIN1–GFP localization or growth defects. DNA was isolated from a total of 399 F 2  plants or their progeny and subjected to polymorphism analysis. The  bex1  mutation was mapped between two markers, F14M4-MunI (19.348 Mb) and T8I13-MboII
To detect the  bex1  mutation by PCR genotyping, the relevant region was amplified by mutagenic PCR using primers At2g47170-71F-XmnI, 5′-GTCTCGATGCTGCTGGTAAGACGAATAT-3′; and At2g47170-211R, 5′-CAACAGTAAATCACATCCATCATACA-3′, and digested with  Xmn I restriction enzyme. To generate the  pARF1A1C::ARF1A1C L34F -GFP  construct, the  ARF1A1C  gene including 2.07 kb of upstream sequence was amplified from  bex1  genomic DNA with the following primers: ARF1A1C-pro2071GWB1F, 5′-GGGGACAAGTTTGTACAAAAAAGCAGGCTTCAGTAACAAGACGGATCCTT-3′; and ARF1A1C-C-fusion-GWB2R, 5′-GGGGACCACTTTGTACAAGAAAGCTGGGTTTGCCTGCGAAACATACATTCA-3′. The PCR product was cloned into a binary vector
