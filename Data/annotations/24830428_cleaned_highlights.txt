ABSTRACT:
RESULTS:
WRKY2 and WRKY34 in pollen at different stages, we fused the  WRKY2  and  WRKY34  genomic sequences, which contain promoter and gene coding region, with YFP. The YFP signal of both fusion proteins was detectable in nuclei, which was consistent with their function as transcription factors. It is also noteworthy that WRKY2- and WRKY34-YFP signals were detectable in the vegetative cell but not in the generative or sperm cells. The  P WRKY2 :WRKY2-YFP  signal was absent in UNMs ( Figure 4B and 4F ), while it became significantly higher in BCP nuclei ( Figure 4C and 4G ). The YFP signal in nuclei was also found in TCP ( Figure 4D and 4H ) and MP ( Figure 4E and 4I ). For  P WRKY34 :WRKY34-YFP , the nucleus YFP signal was dim in UNM, although it was still distinguishable from the pollen auto-fluorescence ( Figure 4J and 4N ). The signal was more detectable in BCP ( Figure 4K and 4O ) and TCP
R, roots; St, stems; L, leaves; Sl, seedlings; B, buds; and Of, open flowers. Error bars = standard derivation. (B to I) Expression and localization of  WRKY2  promoter-driven WRKY2:YFP fusion protein in pollen. DAPI staining was used to locate nuclei (B to E), and YFP signal reveals the localization of WRKY2:YFP fusion at different developmental stages (F to I ) . (B and F) UNM stage, no nucleus-localized YFP signal was detected. Vegetative nucleus localized WRKY2:YFP signal was observed at BCP stage (C and G), TCP stage (D and H), and MP stage (E and I). (J to Q) Expression and localization of  WRKY34  promoter-driven WRKY34:YFP fusion protein in pollen. (J to M) DAPI staining signal. (N to Q) YFP signal. (J and N) UNM stage, weak signal was observed in microspore nucleus. Vegetative nucleus localized WRKY34:YFP signal was observed at BCP stage (K and O), and TCP stage (L and P). No YFP signal was observed in MP (M and Q). Note that as the vegetative cell expressed genes, the WRKY2 and WRKY34 fusion YFP signals were not detectable in generative or sperm cells. MN, microspore nucleus. VN, vegetative nucleus. GN, generative nucleus/nuclei. SN, sperm cell nuclei. Bar = 50 µm. We next obtained a T-DNA insertion line for  WRKY34  (SALK_133019 hereafter  wrky34-1
MATERIALS AND METHODS:
transformation of a  MPK3RNAi mpk6  plant, the  P LAT52 :4myc-WRKY34  cassette was amplified and partially digested with ApaI and BamHI and then cloned into the pGreenII vector  [45] . To generate  P WRKY34 :WRKY34-YFP  and  P WRKY2 :WRKY2-YFP  constructs, genomic fragments of  WRKY34  and  WRKY2  were amplified. PCR products and pGreenII-YFP plasmid were digested by XhoI and EcoRV, and ligation was performed. All the binary vectors described below were transformed into  Agrobacterium  strain GV3101.  Arabidopsis  transformation was performed by
difference of the flowers/buds at different developmental stages, different amounts of total proteins were present, which is reflected by the different amount of Rubisco large subunit protein in the Coomassie-blue stained control gels. In this experiment, a comparison of WRKY34 protein levels in an equal number of developing/mature pollen grains is better than in an equal amount of total proteins. A Phos-tag reagent (NARD Institute) was used for the
and quantitative PCR analysis was performed using an Optican 2 real-time PCR machine (Bio-Rad). Relative levels of each transcript were calculated after being normalized to the  UBC21  or  EF1α  control. DNA-protein electrophoresis mobility shift assay (EMSA) EMSA was performed as previously described  [9] . A synthetic DNA oligonucleotide ( 5′-CGT TGAC CGT TGAC CGAGT TGAC TTTTTA-3′  with three W boxes underlined) was used as a probe. Two complementary strands of the oligonucleotides were annealed
