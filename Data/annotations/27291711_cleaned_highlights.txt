ABSTRACT:
RESULTS:
the folate and Met cycle and monitor root growth and DNA methylation effects. Previously it has been shown that growth phenotypes, DNA methylation and epigenetic silencing defects caused by decreased activated THF pools because of impaired plastidic folylpolyglutamate synthetase (FPGS1), or chemical inhibition of folate synthesis by sulfamethazine (SMZ) were complemented by exogenous application of 5-CHO-THF or Met 32 33 34 35 . Application of 5-CHO-THF, as well as 5-CH3-THF, tests for defects in  mthfd1-1
MATERIALS AND METHODS:
 Biological Research Center (Ohio State University). Genotypes were analysed by PCR using primers listed in  Supplementary Table 2 . The triple mutant  drm1 drm2 cmt3  and the WT transgenic line carrying the  SDC pro -GFP  fusion construct were published previously 4 13 .  mthfd1-1  mutants have been backcrossed with WT plants carrying  SDC pro -GFP . Plants were grown in the greenhouse at long day light cycles, unless stated differently. Genetics screening and mapping analyses WT seeds (2,000) were suspended in 0.3% EMS solution for 13 h with rotation, washed with water and planted on soil. Approximately 1,000 independent M2 populations were collected and screened for GFP fluorescence using a Leica MZ16F Fluorescence Stereomicroscope equipped with a GPF Plus filter. Pictures were taken with a DFC300 FX digital camera. For mapping and identification of EMS mutations, mutant #162 was crossed with WT L er  and 10-days-old F2 seedlings grown on media containing 1 × Murashige and Skoog basal salt mixture (MP) and 20 μg ml −1  glufosinate ammonium (Sigma) were analysed for GFP expression. Genomic DNA was isolated from pooled tissue of 50 GFP-positive F2 mutants and analysed by whole-genome re-sequencing for co-segregating single-nucleotide polymorphisms between Col and  L er
the TAIR10 genome with TopHat2 (ref.  64 ) using defaults settings, except that intron length was set to 40–5,000. Read statistics are listed in  Supplementary Table 3 . Fragments per kilobase of exon per million fragments mapped (FPKM) values and differential gene
leaves 68 . Leave discs were imaged 4 days after infiltration with a LSM 710 confocal microscope (Zeiss), using a Plan-Apochromat × 20/0.8 M27 objective and sequential scanning at excitation/detection  λ  (nm)=514/519–559 (YFP), 488/630–730 (chlorophyll) and 405/409–530 (DAPI). Immunopurification and western blot analysis Agro-infiltrated  N. benthamiana  leaves (0.5 g) were ground in liquid nitrogen, and ground tissue was resuspended in 3 ml of IP buffer (50 mM Tris pH7.6, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 5% (vol/vol) glycerol, 1% Tergitol (Type NP-40, Sigma), 2.8 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 1 μg ml −1  pepstatin, 1 mM PMSF and 1 × protease inhibitor mixture tablet (Roche, 14696200)). Cleared lysates were incubated with 4 μl of anti-GFP antibody (A-11122, Molecular Probes), followed by 50 μl of Dynabeads Protein G (Thermo Fisher Scientific) at 4 °C for 1 h each. Western blotting was performed with anti-FLAG M2-Peroxidase (horseradish peroxidase) antibody (A8592-1MG, Sigma, 1:7,500 dilution). Quantification of metabolites Thiols, amino acids
