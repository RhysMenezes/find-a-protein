ABSTRACT:
RESULTS:
expressed green fluorescent protein (GFP) and red fluorescent protein (DsRED) tagged peptides in epidermis of tobacco ( N. benthamiana ) leaves: (D) projection of serial confocal optical sections through an epidermis cell expressing a CYP86A1:GFP fusion protein, showing reticulate ER-like structures (brightness indicates GFP fluorescence); (E) close-up view showing the vitality of the cell by movement of the ER-like structures over the time indicated by an arrow (also see Video S1 in  Supplementary material  available at  JXB  online); (F–H) co-localization of CYP86A1:GFP (green, F) and HDEL:DsRed (red, G) in ER network, shown in the merged image (yellow, H). CC, Central cylinder; E, endodermis; C, cortex. The CYP86A1:GFP protein is targeted to the ER In order to examine the sub-cellular protein localization of CYP86A1, the green-fluorescent-protein (GFP) was fused to the 3′ end of the coding sequence of  CYP86A1 . Employment of the native promoter to drive the expression of this construct
MATERIALS AND METHODS:
used together with the gene-specific primers 5′-AAGAACCAGCTCAAGGCCACC-3′ (forward) and 5′-AGCAAAAAGCCTAAACCGGGA-3′ (reverse) for line SALK_107454 and 5′-AACGAGTTTCTTGAGCCTCAAG-3′ (forward) and 5′-ACCAGGATTTCAAATACGTCG-3′ (reverse) for line SALK_104083. Homozygous T-DNA insertion mutants were verified by RT-PCR analysis (see below) of 10-d-old seedlings cultivated on MS-agar and examined for the presence or absence of a gene transcript of  CYP86A1  (At5g58860). Generation of plant transformation vectors and transgenic  Arabidopsis For cloning and generation of expression constructs, the Gateway ®  Cloning Technology (
fusion  Prom CYP86A1 :GUS  for expression studies. Similarly, the coding sequence of At5g58860 was amplified from cDNA with the primer pair 5′-GGGGACAAGTTTGTACAAAAAAGCAGGCTACAGAACAAAAGCAAAAAGCCTAAACC-3′ (forward) and 5′-GGGGACCACTTTGTACAAGAAAGCTGGGTTGCAAGCACCTCACCACGAG-3′ (reverse; LS298) to generate the entry clone p161. The C-terminal fusion to GFP (CYP86A1:GFP) was obtained by recombination of p161 with destination vector pMCD84. The 3.4 kb genomic DNA fragment for complementation analysis was generated by PCR using primers LS248 and LS298 amplifying the promoter of At5g58860 together with the genomic sequence. After
transferred to 70% ethanol with two or three changes. Specimens were examined using an Olympus SZ61 binocular (Olympus, Japan) or fixed for light microscopy. Transient expression of GFP-fusions in  Nicotiana benthamiana Agrobacterium tumefaciens  strain GV3101 containing the CYP86A1:GFP construct under the control of the CaMV35S-promoter (35S) were grown in 2 ml LB medium containing the appropriate antibiotics. Following overnight growth at 28 °C, bacteria were pelleted from 500 μl culture by centrifugation and resuspended in 2 ml
placed at 20 °C with a photoperiod of 16 h/8 h light/dark. After 40–48 h, GFP fluorescence was monitored by confocal laser scanning microscopy. As a positive control for co-localization studies, a similar 35S-driven fusion construct, HDEL:DsRED, possesing the ER resident protein retention signal HDEL ( Haseloff  et al. , 1997 ) fused to
organic phase was evaporated in a steam of nitrogen to a volume of ∼100 μl before analysis using gas-liquid chromatography (GC) and mass spectrometry (MS). GC and GC-MS analysis: All samples were treated with bis-( N , N ,-trimethylsilyl)-tri-fluoroacetamide (BSTFA; Macherey-Nagel, Germany) for 40 min at 70 °C to convert free hydroxyl and carboxyl groups into their corresponding trimethylsilyl (TMS) ethers and esters. Monomers were identified on the basis of their electron-impact MS spectra (70 eV, m/z 50–700) after capillary GC (DB-1, 30 m, 0.32 mm, 0.1 μm) on an Agilent 6890N gas chromatograph combined with an Agilent 5973N quadrupole mass-selective detector (Agilent Technologies, Germany). The depolymerization products were separated by on-column-injection at 50 °C, 2 min at 50 °C, 10
area using imaging software. The chloroform extract was spiked with 10 μg of tetracosan (Fluka, Germany) as internal standard and evaporated under a steam of nitrogen to a volume of ∼100 μl prior to GC and GC-MS analysis. Following BSTFA derivatization, wax extracts were separated by the GC system described above applying the following temperature gradient: on-column-injection at 50 °C, 2 min at 50 °C, 40 °C/min to 200 °C, 2 min at 200 °C, 3
