ABSTRACT:
Walker A domain supporting an important function of the VICTR nucleotide binding domain in DFPM responses consistent with VICTR acting as a canonical Resistance protein. The essential nucleo-cytoplasmic regulator of TIR-NB-LRR-mediated effector-triggered immunity, EDS1, was reported to have both nuclear and cytoplasmic actions in pathogen resistance. DFPM was used to investigate the requirements for subcellular EDS1 localization in DFPM-mediated root growth arrest. EDS1-YFP fusions engineered to localize mainly in the cytoplasm or the nucleus by tagging with a nuclear export signal (NES) or a nuclear localization signal (NLS), respectively, were tested. We found that wild-type EDS1-YFP and both the NES and NLS-tagged EDS1 variants were induced by DFPM treatments and fully complemented  eds1  mutant plants in root responses to DFPM, suggesting that

coding sequence. This mutation results in an arginine 1161 to histidine exchange ( Fig 1A ). DFPM signaling is unaffected by EDS1 subcellular targeting signals In our earlier studies, we documented protein-protein interaction of VICTR with EDS1 in the nucleus and that DFPM-triggered VICTR-mediated root growth arrest requires  EDS1  function [ 15 ]. In line with this finding,  eds1-2  mutant plants exhibit DFPM insensitivity in roots and leaves [ 14 ,  15 ]. To
through the nuclear pore complex is important for full pathogen resistance in leaves [ 17 ,  20 ]. We utilized  eds1 - 2  transgenic lines (in Col-0 accession) NES #2–11 and NES #3–4 that express functional EDS1-YFP fused to a C-terminal nuclear export sequence (EDS1-YFP-NES) [ 17 ]. This fusion caused EDS1 to accumulate mainly in the cytoplasm of leaf cells and produced intermediate pathogen resistance in leaves [ 17 ]. As controls, a line expressing EDS1-YFP alone (EDS1-YFP) or EDS1-YFP
tested. These conferred full pathogen resistance in leaf assays [ 17 ]. In a complementary approach,  eds1-2  transgenic lines NLS #A5 and NLS #B2 expressing high and low amounts, respectively, of EDS1-YFP fused to a C-terminal SV40 nuclear localization signal (NLS) which targets EDS1 to the nucleus [ 21 ], were examined. All transgenic EDS1-YFP constructs were expressed under the native EDS1 promoter [ 17 ,  21 ]. With these transgenic materials, we investigated whether cytoplasmic or nuclear enrichment of EDS1-YFP alters the efficiency of the DFPM-triggered root growth arrest response. Localization of EDS1-YFP mainly to the cytoplasm (in lines NES #3–4 and NES #2–11) or the nucleus (in lines NLS #A5 and NLS #B2) was observed previously in confocal live-cell fluorescence imaging and biochemical fractionation experiments performed on leaf tissues [ 17 ,  21 ]. Because DFPM triggers growth arrest in roots, we performed fluorescence
(C). The black horizontal bars mark the root tip position when plants were exposed to DFPM. The vertical black bars separate the indicated genotypes grown on the same plate for clarity. Wild-type EDS1-YFP localized in the cytoplasm and the nucleus of root cells ( Fig 2A ). By contrast, EDS1-YFP in line NES #3–4 exhibited YFP signals predominatly in the cytoplasm ( Fig 2A ). A clear reduction in nuclear YFP fluorescence was observed in nuclei from root cells including the root meristemic zone ( Fig 2A ), elongation zone and differentiation zone of NES #3–4. An opposite pattern was observed for EDS1-YFP in NLS lines #A5 and #B2 in which fluorescence was detected in nuclei of root cells ( Fig 2A ,  S2 Fig ). As expected, the control line EDS1-YFP-nes #1–2 exhibited YFP signals in the cytoplasm and the nucleus of root cells ( S2 Fig ). Together, these findings suggest that subcellular localization of DFPM-induced EDS1-YFP can be modulated in roots. We found that both NES-tagged and NLS-tagged EDS1-YFP proteins fully complemented the  eds1-2  mutant in
EDS1-YFP expressor) and #B2 (low EDS1-YFP expressor) [ 21 ] also showed a wild-type like response ( Fig 2B and 2C ). We concluded that EDS1 can trigger effectively DFPM-triggered root growth arrest when directed to the cytoplasmic or nuclear compartments of root cells.

MATERIALS AND METHODS:
Material and Methods Plant materials and chemicals Arabidopsis thaliana  mutants  victr-1  (Salk_123918) and  eds1-2  (in Col-0 accession) were described in Kim et al. [ 15 ]. All EDS1-YFP transgenic lines were generated in  eds1-2  (Col-0 accession). EDS1-YFP, EDS1-YFP-NES and EDS1-YFP-nes transgenic lines are described in Garcia et al. [ 17 ], and EDS1-YFP-NLS transgenic lines are described in Stuttmann et al. [ 21 ]. DFPM ([5-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)furan-2-yl]-piperidine-1-ylmethanethione) was purchased from Chembridge (chemical ID 6015316) and Innovapharm (Ukraine, chemical ID STT-00334837). DFPM root growth assay and subcellular localization of EDS1 isoforms in the root tissue As described before [ 15 ], seeds were sterilized and germinated on half MS medium (half-strength Murashige and Skoog Basal Medium with Gamborg′s vitamins (M0404 Sigma), 0.05% MES, pH 5.7, 1% sucrose) plates with
Subsequently, the root tip position was marked and root growth arrest was monitored after 6 d. All root growth experiments were repeated at least three times in independent experiments and representative images are shown. For subcellular localization studies of EDS1-YFP isoforms within root cells, 5 day-old plant seedlings were exposed to 10 μM DFPM for 24 h and monitored using a Zeiss LSM 710 confocal microscope (Ex 514 nm/ Em 519–621 nm). Constant gain and pinhole values were used to observe pEDS1-EDS1-YFP, pEDS1-EDS1-YFP-NES and pEDS1-EDS1-YFP-NLS high expressor #A5. For pEDS1-EDS1-YFP-nes and the pEDS1-EDS1-YFP-NLS low expressor line #B2, an increased gain value was used to enhance the YFP signal. Quantitative Real-time RT-PCR Plants were grown in 1/2 MS plates with 1% sucrose for 14 days and transferred to a 24 well plate containing 1/2 MS solution with 10 μM DFPM or DMSO for 24 hours. Total RNA was extracted using Spectrum ™  Plant Total RNA Kit (Sigma-Aldrich), treated with TURBO ™  DNase (Thermo-Fisher) and reverse-transcribed using First-Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (GE Healthcare). Real-time RT-PCR was performed to quantify  VICTR ,  PR5  or  EDS1  transcript levels. Amplified samples were normalized against the housekeeping gene  PDF2 . To extract RNA from shoots and roots separately, plants were grown in vertical plates. After DFPM treatment, shoots and roots were isolated and used for RNA extraction separately as mentioned earlier. Primers used are: VICTR-qRT2-F  5’- AGAGACCGGTTCATCAGCAGAG-3’ , VICTR-qRT2-R  5’-CCATATTGCCTTCTTCGGCTTGAG-3’ , PR5-F  5’-ATCACCCACAGCACAGAGACAC-3’ , PR5-R  5’-AGCAATGCCGCTTGTGATGAAC-3’ , EDS1 qRT-F  5’-GCTCAATGACCTTGGAGTGAGC-3’ , EDS1 qRT-R  5’-TCTTCCTCTAATGCAGCTTGAACG-3’ , PDF2-F  5’-TAACGTGGCCAAAATGATGC-3’ , PDF2-R  5’-GTTCTCCACAACCGCTTGGT-3’ . FDA cell viability assay using microplate reader Half-strength MS medium was aliquoted into a white 96 well plate (08-771-26 Corning Life Sciences). Subsequently, one sterilized seed per well was added and the plate sealed using parafilm. After 2 d of
μM DFPM final concentration). Half of the plate was wrapped with aluminum foil to protect the samples from light. Plates were returned to the Percival growth chamber for a 6 h incubation time. From a 250 μg/ml fluorescein diacetate (FDA) stock (Sigma, F7378, in DMSO) 5.5 μL/well were added to get a final concentration of ~5 μg/ml. After 5 min incubation at room temperature, cell viability was determined by fluorescence detection (Ex 485 nm /Em 510 nm) using a Berthold plate reader (Mithras LB 940). FDA cell viability assay in roots Seven day-old seedlings were incubated in half MS medium containing DFPM at the indicated concentrations for 24 hours. Seedlings were stained with 7 μg/ml FDA and 5 μg/ml propidium iodide (Sigma, P4170) for 10 seconds. After a brief rinse with water, root cells were monitored using a Zeiss LSM 710 confocal microscope (Ex 488 nm/ Em 493–555 nm). Constant gain and pinhole values were used to observe fluorescence. To quantify FDA fluorescence signals and calculate IC 50  values, seedlings exposed to DFPM with increasing concentrations from 0.5 to 10 μM were stained with 7 μg/ml FDA and observed using a Nikon Eclipse TE2000-U Confocal microscope (Ex 488 nm/ Em 500–550 nm). Fluorescence intensity was measured using Image J program [ 36
