ABSTRACT:
The  NFX1-LIKE1  ( NFXL1 ) and  NFXL2  genes were identified as regulators of salt stress responses. The NFXL1 protein is a nuclear factor that positively affects adaptation to salt stress. The  nfxl1-1  loss-of-function mutant displayed reduced survival rates under salt and high light stress. In contrast, the  nfxl2-1  mutant, defective in the  NFXL2  gene, and
the mutant. Three  NFXL2  splice variants were cloned and named  NFXL2-78 ,  NFXL2-97 , and  NFXL2-100  according to the molecular weight of the putative proteins. Translational fusions to the green fluorescent protein suggest nuclear localisation of the NFXL2 proteins. Stable expression of the  NFXL2-78  splice variant in  nfxl2-1  plants largely complemented the mutant phenotype. Our data show that  NFXL2  controls ABA levels and suppresses ABA responses. 
RESULTS:
mutants are indicated. B. Subcellular localisation of GFP:NFXL2-100, GFP:NFXL2-97, and GFP:NFXL2-78 proteins. GFP-fluorescent images and bright field images of roots of stably transformed Arabidopsis plants. The scale bar represents 25 µm. To determine whether NFXL2-78 is imported into the nucleus, a GFP (green fluorescent protein)-tagged NFXL2-78 protein was stably expressed in Arabidopsis plants. Green fluorescence was detectable in the nuclei of root cells ( Figure 1B ). Thus, the NFXL2-78 protein directs GFP to the nucleus. Analysis of plants carrying the 35S::GFP:NFXL2-97 and 35S::GFP:NFXL2-100 constructs suggests that the NFXL2-97 and NFXL2-100 isoforms presumably are also nuclear proteins. NFXL2  expression pattern Web-based platforms such as Genevestigator  [45]  and the Arabidopsis eFP Browser  [46]  indicate the presence of relatively steady levels of  NFXL2  transcript in most tissues and cell types.
MATERIALS AND METHODS:
ATT CAG CCA CCT GTA G  3’, and NFXL2-97/100-rev 5’ TT A GAT TCG AGG GTA TCT TCT AGA C  3’. The PCR fragments were cloned into the pENTR/D-TOPO (Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany) vector, and used to establish GFP fusion constructs using the pK7FWG2 vector  [73] . The  NFXL2-78 ,  NFXL2-97 , and  NFXL2-100  sequences were also inserted into the pH7WG2 vector for expression under control of the 35S promoter  [73] .
