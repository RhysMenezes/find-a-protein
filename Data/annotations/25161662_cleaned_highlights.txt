ABSTRACT:
RESULTS:
the 11 different physical locations in SUBA3 (namely cytosol, endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi, mitochondrion, nucleus, peroxisome, plasma membrane, and plastid). Eight Deg proteases have been identified in subcellular proteomic studies, and two of those eight have additionally been localized by GFP tagging ( Figure  2 ).
determined locations by GFP tagging and mass spectrometry, as well as protein–protein interaction (PPI) data. Short TAIR descriptions are displayed in gray and the name of each Deg family member is indicated on the left. DEFINING THE SIZE OF EXPERIMENTAL VS PREDICTED DATASETS FOR A SPECIFIC SUBCELLULAR
of the subcellular locations of proteins by different experimental methods ( Table  1 ). An additional step supported by SUBA is combining experimental sets like mass spectrometry and GFP tagging (“MS/MS assay” OR “GFP assay”). Using this approach, plastid and mitochondrial sets can be defined that contain 2385 and 1034 proteins respectively. These sets can be expanded by adding
predicted to be in the relevant organelle to construct the total predicted proteome. For example, by including proteins predicted by the three predictors TargetP, Predotar and YLoc [“MS/MS assay” OR “GFP assay” OR (“TargetP” AND “Predotar” AND “YLoc”)], the plastid proteome set is 3026 proteins and the mitochondrial set is 1651. The sizes of a variety of organelle proteomes in plants and other eukaryotes have been previously reported in the literature ( Table  1 ). Table 1 Compiled localization data collected in SUBA3.

and determine whether similar conflicts/contaminations have also been reported by other groups. Deg9, for example, has been localized by MS to two different locations by two independent research groups.  Pendle et al. (2005)  found Deg9 in the nucleus, whereas  Kleffmann et al. (2004)  claim a plastid location for this protein. Using the “Literature reference location”
that 20 of the 26 proteins for which independent GFP tagging data exist were confirmed to be located in the nucleus, whereas a plastid location could only be verified for two proteins. This suggests that a nuclear location for Deg9 is more likely than a plastid location. POTENTIALLY MULTI-TARGETED
lists of candidates for dual-targeted proteins can be generated. To compile a list of candidate proteins targeted to both plastid and mitochondrion, for example, SUBA3 can be queried for proteins that have been observed in these two locations by GFP tagging or mass spectrometry [(by “GFP” to be in “mitochondrion” OR by “MS/MS” to be in “mitochondrion”) AND (by “GFP” to be in “plastid” OR by “MS/MS” to be in “plastid”)]. This results in a list of 315 proteins that have been observed in both locations. Using SQL or manually analyzing the SUBA3 result file shows that in many of these cases (93 proteins) both locations
and peroxisomes a list of 41 proteins. These potential examples of dual-targeting can be tested experimentally by GFP tagging, import studies or other approaches. Figure  2  shows that for three Deg proteases experimental localization data disagree. Both Deg1 and Deg9 have been localized to the plastid and nucleus using mass spectrometry ( Figure  2 ). Similarly, Deg7 has been localized to the plastid by GFP tagging and to the cytosol by mass spectrometry ( Figure  2 ). Searching GFP and MS data sets in SUBA using the procedure described above results in a list of 398 proteins localized to the plastid and nucleus and a list of 254 proteins for plastid and cytosol. Analyzing these two lists further shows that
the majority of proteins the plastid/nucleus or plastid/cytosol dual locations were described in different publications, including Deg1, Deg7, and Deg9, and thus, these Deg proteases are potentially unrecognized dual-targeted proteins. EXPANDING DEG PROTEASE LOCALIZATION DATA FROM SUBA3 WITH NOVEL GFP TAGGING DATA When considering the Deg protease
have masked the targeting ability of the plastid and mitochondrial signal peptides. On the contrary, Deg15 contains a  C -terminal peroxisomal targeting signal 1 (PTS1, Ser-Lys-Leu) and a  C -terminally tagged Deg15 would be mistargeted. Thus, the GFP was fused to the  N -terminus
of the protein with the number of amino acids (AA) indicated in the schematic representation of each construct (left) were fused to GFP. Targeting ability was tested in  Arabidopsis  suspension cells using SSU-RFP as a marker for plastid targeting, ScCOX4-mCherry as a marker for mitochondrial targeting, and mCherry-PTS1 as a marker for peroxisome targeting. Multiple co-localizations are presented for Deg3, Deg7, and Deg10 as these Deg proteases localized to more than one subcellular compartment in this study suggesting dual-targeting or conflicting localization results. Scale as indicated. Plastid and mitochondrial Deg proteases The plastid location of Deg1, Deg2, Deg5, and Deg8 reported by multiple proteomic studies was confirmed by GFP tagging ( Figure  3 ). These proteases have been shown to function either in the chloroplast stroma (Deg2) or in the thylakoid lumen (Deg1, Deg5, Deg8) and it has been suggested that they are involved in the biogenesis of photosystem II, maintaining protein homeostasis in the thylakoid lumen, and degrading and repairing damaged proteins in the thylakoid lumen and the stroma (reviewed in  Schuhmann and Adamska, 2012 ). The nuclear location of Deg1 found by MS studies could not be confirmed by GFP tagging, despite using a full-length fusion that should contain any nuclear localization signal of Deg1. The PPI data show that Deg1 interacts with TCP14 (At3g47620), a transcription factor localized to the nucleus that regulates seed germination and shows elevated
localized to the nucleus were performed on adult plants so do not directly support the germination hypothesis. The plastid location of Deg11 reported by a single proteomic study ( Friso et al., 2004 ) could not be confirmed by GFP tagging. Instead Deg11 was found to be located in the mitochondrion ( Figure  3 ). A mitochondrial location of this protease is also predicted by 14 of the 22 predictors in SUBA3, including TargetP ( Emanuelsson et al.,
and nothing is known about their physiological roles. At least eight predictors in SUBA3 predict a mitochondrial location for Deg3, Deg6, Deg10, Deg12, and Deg14 and indeed we found these five proteases are targeted to the mitochondrion by our GFP tagging approach ( Figure  3 ). Surprisingly, a fluorescence signal was also detected in the plastid when Deg3-GFP and Deg10-GFP fusion constructs were used to transform  Arabidopsis  suspension cells ( Figure  3 ), suggesting that Deg3 and Deg10 are dual-targeted to the mitochondrion and to the plastid. Interestingly, Deg3 and Deg10 were also predicted to both

Peroxisome Deg protease The location of Deg15 in peroxisomes was previously demonstrated by both subcellular proteomic and GFP tagging studies ( Eubel et al., 2008 ;  Schuhmann et al., 2008 ). As shown in  Figure  3 , the peroxisomal location of Deg15 was confirmed again
reported that Deg9 has been located by different proteomic studies to the plastid ( Kleffmann et al., 2004 ) and to the nucleus ( Pendle et al., 2005 ). The nuclear location of Deg9 could be confirmed here by GFP tagging ( Figure  3 ). However, the plastid location could not be confirmed in this study. From the analysis of conflicts between published localization datasets (see Conflicts Between Published Localization Datasets) a nuclear location for Deg9 is also
Deg7, the last of the proteases for which proteomic data are available in SUBA3, was reported to be located in the cytosol ( Ito et al., 2011 ). Another study has found this protease in the chloroplast stroma by GFP tagging and immunoblotting ( Sun et al., 2010 ). Neither of these two locations could be verified by GFP tagging in this study, instead Deg7 was localized to the nucleus and the mitochondrion ( Figure  3 ). A nuclear location is plausible because Deg7 is putatively orthologous to the only fungal Deg protease, which is located in the nucleus ( Schuhmann et al., 2011 ). The nuclear location of Deg7 could have been missed by  Sun et al. (2010)  as the authors fused only the  N -terminal 243 amino acids of Deg7 to GFP, whereas in this study the full-length coding sequence of Deg7 was fused to the  N -terminus of GFP. Interestingly, NLS Mapper ( Kosugi et al., 2009 ) predicts a bipartite nuclear localization signal from 845 to 873 amino acids. The analysis of  deg7  mutant plants revealed that the mutant is more sensitive to high light
Additionally, it was shown that Deg7 interacts directly with PSII ( Sun et al., 2010 ). Thus, a plastid location of this protease is likely and may have been missed in this study for a reason associated with the GFP fusion or the intensity of fluorescence in the plastid.  Ito et al. (2011)  localized Deg7 to the cytosol using a proteomic approach. Although purification techniques have improved immensely and the authors rigorously selected for cytosolic proteins, it

To best estimate a protein’s location in the cell, SUBA3 also contains a consensus location (SUBAcon) based on Bayesian probabilities calculated from all the experimental localization data and predictions available for each protein. SUBCELLULAR LOCALIZATION BY GFP TAGGING The full-length coding sequences where ever possible, or the first 222–300 bp of the coding sequences of  Deg1–Deg16  were amplified according to the manufacturer’s instructions using the Expand High Fidelity PCR system (Roche Diagnostics) with primers
the  attB  sites for Gateway ®  cloning. The PCR products of  Deg1–Deg15  were cloned into the Gateway ®  vector pDONR207 (Invitrogen) and sequenced. The entry clone and a Gateway ®  cloning cassette (pDest/pgem/CGFP;  Carrie et al., 2009 ) were recombined to clone the full-length or the first 222–300 bp in frame with the coding region of the GFP at their  N - or  C -terminus. For co-localization studies, the small subunit (SSU) of  Arabidopsis  ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase oxygenase fused to the  N -terminus of the red FP (SSU-RFP;  Carrie et al., 2009 ) was used as a plastid control, the mitochondrial targeting sequence of yeast  ScCox4  fused to the  N -terminus of mCherry in pBIN20 (mt-rk  CD3-991 ;  Nelson et al.,

The fusion constructs were biolistically transformed into cultured  Arabidopsis  cells. The GFP and RFP/mCherry plasmids (5 μg of each) were co-precipitated onto 1-μm gold particles and transformed using the biolistic PDS-1000/He system (Bio-Rad). Particles were bombarded onto 2 mL of cultured  Arabidopsis  cells resting on filter paper on osmoticum plates (2.17
