against Nt-p24β3 at the Golgi apparatus and the ER. Arrowheads point to gold particles. ER, endoplasmic reticulum; G, Golgi apparatus; MVB, multivesicular body. Trafficking properties of p24 proteins of the delta subfamily It was previously demonstrated that transiently expressed RFP–p24δ5 localizes to the ER at steady state but cycles between the ER and Golgi ( Langhans  et al ., 2008 ;  Montesinos  et al ., 2012 ).  Arabidopsis  p24 proteins of the delta subfamily
exclusively to the ER, while members of the p24δ2 subclass (which comprisee p24δ7–p24δ11) localized to both the ER and Golgi when transiently expressed in tobacco leaf epidermal cells ( Chen and Zheng, 2012 ). Therefore, the trafficking properties of RFP–p24δ5 (p24δ1 subclass) and RFP–p24δ9 (p24δ2 subclass) were compared. In marked contrast to the data of  Chen and Zheng (2012) , it was found that transiently expressed RFP–p24δ9 localizes exclusively to the ER, both in tobacco protoplasts ( Fig. 3A – F ;  Supplementary Fig. S3  at  JXB  online) and in tobacco leaf epidermal cells ( Fig. 3J – O ). In both cases, RFP–p24δ9 co-localized extensively with the ER markers GFP/YFP–HDEL but not with the Golgi markers ManI–GFP/YFP. At low expression levels, it showed a pattern nearly indistinguishable from that of RFP–p24δ5. At higher expression levels, it partially localized to dots, or even to ring-like structures, probably artefacts of overexpression. However, none of these structures was found to co-localize with the Golgi markers ManI–GFP/YFP ( Supplementary Fig. S3 ). Therefore, transiently expressed RFP–p24δ9 seems to localize exclusively to the ER, like RFP–p24δ5 ( Langhans  et al ., 2008 ;  Montesinos  et al ., 2012 ). Fig. 3. Localization of RFP–p24δ9.

Scale bars=5 μm. In order to investigate if transiently expressed RFP–p24δ9 also cycles between the ER and Golgi, as does RFP–p24δ5, RFP–p24δ9 was co-expressed with the GTP-restricted ARF1(Q71L) mutant, which prevents COPI-mediated Golgi–ER recycling ( Pimpl  et al ., 2003 ). This treatment has been shown to redistribute RFP–p24δ5 partially to the Golgi apparatus ( Langhans  et al ., 2008 ;  Montesinos  et al ., 2012 ). Interestingly, this treatment did not change the ER localization of RFP–p24δ9 ( Fig. 3G – I ). Trafficking properties and stability of p24 proteins of the beta subfamily The trafficking properties of (X)FP–p24β3 were also investigated. Similar to GFP–p24β2, YFP–p24β3 showed a punctate pattern, which partially co-localized with the Golgi markers ERD2–CFP ( Fig. 4A – C ) or ManI–RFP ( Fig. 4G – I ). When co-expressed with the GDP-restricted ARF1(T31N) mutant, which causes relocalization of Golgi markers to the ER ( Lee  et al ., 2002 ), YFP–p24β3 completely redistributed to the ER, where it co-localized with both ERD2–CFP ( Fig. 4D - F ) and Man I–RFP ( Fig. 4J – L ). This was also the case for YFP–p24β2 ( Supplementary Fig. S4  at  JXB  online). These data suggest that transiently expressed p24β2 and p24β3 mainly localize to the Golgi apparatus, as had been observed for the endogenous proteins. When GFP–p24β2 or YFP–p24β3 was co-expressed with Sec12, to inhibit COPII-dependent ER export, both proteins were mainly localized to the ER, together with the Golgi marker Man I–RFP ( Fig. 5A – F ). This suggests that both proteins exit the ER in a COPII-dependent manner. In contrast to GFP–p24β2, co-expression of YFP–p24β3 and Sec12 not only led to a complete reticular pattern, but some dots were also very obvious ( Fig. 5D – F ). To test for the identity of these dots, YFP–p24β3 and Sec12 were co-expressed with 6kDa VP–CFP, a COPII/ERES marker ( Lerich  et al ., 2011 ). As shown in  Fig. 5G – I , many of the YFP–p24β3 punctae co-localized with 6kDa VP–CFP, suggesting that at least a fraction of YFP–p24β3 may accumulate at ERES under these conditions. Fig. 4.

As had been observed with GFP–p24β2 ( Montesinos  et al ., 2012 ), the signal obtained for YFP–p24β3 in the CLSM
and homogenized to obtain a post-nuclear supernatant, which was then centrifuged to obtain a total membrane fraction. Membranes were extracted in Laemmli sample buffer and analysed by SDS–PAGE (12% acrylamide) and western blot analysis with antibodies against Ct-p24β2 or GFP (to detect p24β3). A 30 μg aliquot of protein was loaded for each of the extracts. Western blotting with an antibody against the plasma membrane (PM) ATPase was used as a loading control (lower panel). Interactions between different members
 Fig. 7A – C , when GFP–p24β2 was co-expressed with RFP–p24δ9, the signal of GFP–p24β2 was clearly more intense than when expressed alone, but still localized to punctae. In addition, it was observed that RFP–p24δ9 showed its typical ER pattern but also localized to the same punctae under these conditions (see also  Table 1A ). The punctae where both proteins co-localize overlapped extensively with the Golgi marker ERD2–YFP ( Fig. 8A – H ), but also with the COPII/ERES marker 6kDa VP–CFP ( Fig. 8I – P ). This suggests that GFP–p24β2 is able to enhance the ER exit of RFP–p24δ9 and its transport to the Golgi apparatus, as happens with RFP–p24δ5 ( Montesinos  et al ., 2012 ). This was also the case when GFP–p24β2 and RFP–p24δ9 were transiently co-expressed in tobacco leaf epidermal cells: while RFP–p24δ9 localized exclusively to the ER when expressed individually ( Fig. 3J – O ), it also localized to punctae when co-expressed with CFP–p24β2. Under these conditions, the punctae containing CFP–p24β2 showed an almost complete co-localization with RFP–p24δ9 ( Supplementary Fig. S5  at 
next investigated in co-expression experiments. As shown in  Fig. 7D – I , GFP–p24β3 punctae showed only a partial co-localization with either RFP–p24δ5 or RFP–p24δ9 (see also  Table 1A ). Strikingly, GFP–p24β3 did not significantly change the ER localization of RFP–p24δ5 or RFP–p24δ9, in contrast to GFP–p24β2 ( Fig. 7D – I ). Table 1.

Triple or quadruple co-expression experiments were performed next. First, the two p24β proteins (CFP–p24β2 and YFP–p24β3) were co-expressed with either RFP–p24δ5 (
(RFP–p24δ5 and RFP–p24δ9) were co-expressed with either GFP–p24β2 or GFP–p24β3. Under these conditions, GFP–p24β2 and RFP–p24δ5/9 extensively co-localized in punctate structures ( Fig. 10A – F ). In contrast, GFP–p24β3 was only partially punctate and significantly redistributed to the ER, where it partially co-localized with RFP–p24δ5/9 ( Fig. 10G – L ). Fig. 9.

To quantify whether the levels of GFP–p24β proteins might depend on their trafficking properties, protoplasts were analysed by western blotting following the co-expression

Membranes were extracted in Laemmli sample buffer and analysed by SDS–PAGE (12% acrylamide) and western blot analysis with antibodies against RFP (to detect RFP–p24δ5 and RFP–p24δ9), the p24β2 C-terminus, or GFP (to quantify the amount of both GFP–p24β2 and GFP–p24β3). A 30 μg aliquot of protein was loaded for each of the extracts. Western blot with an antibody against the plasma membrane (PM) ATPase was used as a loading control.

MATERIALS AND METHODS:
controlled room at 22 °C with a 16h daylength. Recombinant plasmid production The coding sequences of red fluorescent protein (RFP)–p24δ9, cyan fluorescent protein/green fluorescent protein (CFP/GFP)–p24β2, or GFP/yellow fluorescent protein (YFP)–p24β3 were synthesized commercially  de novo  (Geneart AG), based on the sequences of GFP/CFP/YFP/RFP and that of the  Arabidopsis  p24 proteins At1g26690 (p24δ9), At3g07680 (p24β2), and At3g22845 (p24β3). All RFP-tagged proteins were tagged with monomeric RFP (mRFP) to prevent oligomerization. Similarly, only mGFP5 was used for GFP-tagged proteins. The sequence of the fluorophore was always located behind the coding sequence of the p24 signal sequence and the 5ʹ extreme end of the mature p24 coding sequence ( Supplementary Fig. S1  at  JXB  online). The coding sequences of RFP–p24δ9 or XFP–p24β2/β3 were cloned into the pBP30 vector (carrying the 35S promoter;  Nebenführ  et al ., 1999 ) through  Bgl II/ Not I.

Plasmids encoding marker proteins were: GFP–p24β2 and RFP–p24δ5 ( Langhans  et al ., 2008 ;  Montesinos  et al ., 2012 ), Man1–RFP and Man1–GFP ( Nebenführ  et al ., 1999 ), GFP–HDEL ( Nebenführ  et al ., 2000 ), ERD2–CFP/YFP ( Brandizzi  et al ., 2002 ), 6kDa VP–CFP ( Wei and Wang, 2008 ), Sec12 ( Pimpl  et al ., 2003 ), ARF1(T31N) (Lee  et al ., 2003), and ARF1(Q71L) ( Pimpl  et al ., 2003 ). Generation of antibodies Rabbit antibodies were generated
using a Zeiss Axiovert LSM510 Meta confocal laser scanning microsope (CLSM). At the Metadetector, the main beam splitters (HFT) 458/514 and 488/543 were used. The following fluorophores (excited and emitted by frame switching in the multitracking mode) were used: GFP (488nm/496–518nm), CFP (458nm/464–486nm), YFP (514nm/529–550nm), and RFP (543nm/593–636nm). Post-acquisition image processing was performed using the Zeiss LSM 5
obtained after western blot was quantified using the Quantity One software (Bio-Rad Laboratories). Western blot with an antibody against the plasma membrane ATPase ( Montesinos  et al ., 2012 ) was used as a loading control. Antibodies against RFP and GFP were obtained from Clontech and Life Technologies, respectively. Mutant characterization A line (Columbia, background) containing a T-DNA insertion in
