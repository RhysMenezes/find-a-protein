ABSTRACT:
RESULTS:
Bar: 10 µm). RAD51-GFP is inactive in mitotic recombination and confers a dominant-negative phenotype As seen above, the RAD51-GFP fusion protein is properly expressed and functional during meiosis. In somatic tissues, the expected strong GFP expression is visible in nuclei of meristematic cells in primary and lateral roots and none detected in non-dividing root transition and elongation zones ( Figure 3 ). 10.1371/journal.pgen.1003787.g003 Figure 3 RAD51-GFP is expressed in nuclei of meristematic cells in primary and lateral roots. RAD51-GFP fusion protein is present in the nuclei of primary root meristem (left panels) and lateral root meristem cells (right panels). No or faint signals are observed in transition and elongation zone. Differential interference contrast (DIC)+GFP (upper panels) and GFP

Using immunocytology to detect RAD51 nucleofilaments as brightly staining nuclear foci, we tested whether the RAD51-GFP protein retains its ability to assemble at sites of DNA breaks induced by gamma-irradiation in  rad51 / rad51  RAD51-GFP plants. We have recently shown that gamma-ray induced RAD51 foci are easily visualised in Arabidopsis using a dose of 100 Gy  [38] . As expected, no foci and only diffuse anti-RAD51 nuclear staining were observed in root tip nuclei of unirradiated control plantlets ( Figure 5A ). Numerous foci were detected in nuclei from  rad51 / rad51  RAD51-GFP root tips fixed one or two hours after 100 Gy of gamma-rays ( Figure 5A ), confirming that the ability of RAD51 to assemble at sites of DNA damage is retained in somatic cells. The radio-inducibility of the RAD51-GFP was confirmed by western blotting analyses after irradiation ( Figure S1  and  Protocol S1 ). 10.1371/journal.pgen.1003787.g005 Figure 5 RAD51 foci are formed in root-tip nuclei and PMCs of  rad51  RAD51-GFP mutants.

Irradiation-induced RAD51-GFP foci are clearly visible in nuclei of the irradiated plants. DNA is stained with DAPI (blue) and RAD51-GFP foci (detected using an antibody against RAD51) are coloured in red. Images are collapsed Z-stack projections of a deconvoluted 3D image stack.

The ability of the RAD51-GFP fusion to assemble at DNA breaks in meiotic cells was confirmed by immunolocalisation of RAD51 and ASY1 in pollen mother cell nuclei of  rad51 / rad51  RAD51-GFP plants, which show the expected numerous meiotic RAD51 foci ( Figure 5B ). Immunostaining of DMC1 protein in these nuclei revealed the expected presence of abundant DMC1 foci in the  rad51/rad51  RAD51-GFP plants ( Figure S2 ). DMC1 alone is able to repair meiotic DSBs The RAD51-GFP protein is thus present and forms nucleofilaments in  rad51

MATERIALS AND METHODS:
Murashige and Skoog salts (M0255; Duchefa Biochemie). Plants were then cultivated in a greenhouse or growth chamber with a 16/8 hour light/dark cycle, temperature 23°C and 45% to 60% relative humidity. Cloning of RAD51 and plant transformation For translational GFP fusions, the genomic region without stop codon and a 1036 bp 5′ upstream sequence of RAD51 was amplified (forward primer  TGATTAGCATTTAGCGTCAAG  and reverse primer  ATCCTTGCAATCTGTTACACC ), inserted into pDONR221 and verified by sequencing. The complete fragment
under vacuum for 15 min and incubated 24 hours at 37°C. Staining solution was replaced with 70% ethanol to remove chlorophyll and blue spots counted under a dissecting microscope. Analysis of meiotic recombination rate Wild-type and  rad51  RAD51-GFP mutant plants ( Col  ecotype) were crossed with wild-type  Landsberg erecta  ecotype  (Ler)  plants. RAD51/rad51 heterozygotes carrying the RAD51-GFP (also heterozygous), and RAD51/RAD51 wild-type F1,  Col/Ler  hybrids were selected. Meiotic recombination rates were monitored in the F2 segregating populations by INDEL marker genotyping. For genotyping, seeds from the F2 populations were surface-sterilised and grown in vitro on 0.5× MS, 1% sucrose, 0.8% agar for two-weeks. Individual seedlings were harvested, DNA extracted using NaCl method and samples genotyped by PCR followed
