ABSTRACT:
RESULTS:
NPSN11-containing complex also lacked a Qc-SNARE (see  Table 1  for overview of SNAREs analyzed here). We attempted to identify KNOLLE-interacting R-SNAREs among candidate R-SNAREs of the VAMP721-727 family localized as green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusions to the plasma membrane by transient overexpression in  Arabidopsis  protoplasts, as has been KNOLLE itself ( Uemura  et al ., 2004 ). Of these, VAMP721 and VAMP722 were particularly interesting candidates because they form complexes

complex The KNOLLE/SNAP33/VAMP721,722 complex appeared complete, conforming to the plasma membrane type of trimeric SNARE complex. However, the other KNOLLE complex still lacked a Qc-SNARE. A candidate was suggested from subcellular localization studies of the Qc-SNARE SYP71 fused to GFP, which accumulated at both ER and plasma membrane ( Suwastika  et al ., 2008 ). A previous study involving transient overexpression of GFP-fusion proteins in  Arabidopsis  protoplasts did not reveal any Qc-SNARE localizing at the plasma membrane ( Uemura  et al ., 2004 ). We confirmed the localization of GFP-SYP71 to ER and plasma membrane and also detected GFP-SYP71 at the cell plate (Supplemental Figure 5A). Using antiserum raised against SYP71, we observed accumulation of endogenous SYP71 at the cell plate, where it colocalized with KNOLLE ( Figure 2, D–F ). Whether SYP71 interacts

Of interest, this  snap33 npsn11  double-mutant phenotype was completely rescued by expression of yellow fluorescent protein (YFP)–NPSN11 from the cytokinesis-specific  KNOLLE
MATERIALS AND METHODS:
 vamp721  (At1g04750; SALK_037273, GABI_052G12),  vamp722  (At2g33120; SALK_119149),  npsn11  (At2g35190; SALK_068094), and  syp71  (At3g09740; GABI_367A08) mutants. The following rescue genotypes were generated by crossing or transformation:  snap33 npsn11  plants expressing YFP-NPSN11 and  vamp721 vamp722  plants expressing Myc-VAMP721 or YFP-VAMP722. Transgenic plants were generated by  Agrobacterium tumefaciens –mediated transformation ( Clough and Bent, 1998 ). Plants were grown either on soil or on vertically oriented agar plates with 2.15 g/l Murashige and Skoog (1/2 MS) medium containing 1% sucrose in growth chambers at 20–24°C with a 16-h photoperiod or in continuous light. Molecular cloning and transcriptional analysis Cloning of artificial microRNA (amiRNA) for SYP71 was done as described ( Schwab  et al .,
cloned under the GAL4-responsive  UAS  element, and these reporter lines were crossed with the  RPS5A::GAL4  activator lines ( Weijers  et al ., 2003 ). For subcellular localization studies, the DNA sequence encoding Myc epitope, GFP, or YFP was fused in-frame to the ATG codon of the respective coding sequence and downstream of the  KNOLLE  5′ regulatory sequences ( Müller  et al ., 2003 ). For transcriptional analysis, total RNA was extracted from seedlings
