ABSTRACT:
RESULTS:
developmental phenotypes of  mos14-1  ( Figure S4 ), suggesting that the fusion protein is functional. Confocal fluorescence microscopy analysis of transgenic plants expressing the MOS14-GFP fusion protein showed that the GFP signal is found exclusively in the nucleus ( Figure 3 ), indicating that MOS14 is a nuclear protein. In the nuclei of root cells, GFP fluorescence was excluded from a large part of the nucleus, probably the nucleolus. We did not observe similar exclusion of MOS14-GFP from parts of the nuclei in epidermal cells, probably because these nuclei are much smaller than those in root cells. 10.1371/journal.pgen.1002159.g003 Figure 3 MOS14 localizes to the nucleus.

whether the  mos14-1  mutation affects the nuclear import of Arabidopsis SR proteins, we made constructs expressing four  SR  genes  AtRS2Z33 ,  AtRSZ21 ,  AtRS31  and  AtSR34  with a C-terminal GFP tag. These constructs were transformed into protoplasts of
the SR-GFP proteins. A construct expressing the SARD1-GFP fusion protein was included as the control  [26] . As shown in  Figure 5A , in both wild type and  mos14-1  protoplasts, SARD1 was localized in the nucleus. Consistent with previous studies  [27] , the SR-GFP proteins were clearly localized in the nucleus of wild type protoplasts. However, in  mos14-1  protoplasts, the SR-GFP proteins were mainly localized in the cytoplasm ( Figure 5A  and  Table 1 ), suggesting that MOS14 is required for the nuclear localization of SR proteins. 10.1371/journal.pgen.1002159.g005 Figure 5 Localization of SR proteins in wild type and
MATERIALS AND METHODS:
grown at 23°C under 16 hr light/8 hr dark in plant growth rooms or chambers, if not specifically mentioned. To identify mutations that suppress the mutant phenotypes of  snc1 ,  snc1 npr1  seeds were mutagenized with EMS. About 30,000 M2 plants representing about 1,500 M1 families were screened for suppression of the dwarf morphology of  snc1 npr1-1 . Mutants lacking the dwarf phenotype were further analyzed for suppression of the constitutive defense responses in 
The primers used for amplification of F23R20 are F23 and R20 and their sequences are listed in the  Table S1 . The 11 kb fragment described above was cloned into a modified pCambia1305 vector expressing C-terminal tagged  GFP  to obtain  pMOS14:MOS14-GFP . For transient expression of SR proteins in protoplasts, full-length cDNAs of  AtRS2Z33 ,  AtRSZ21 ,  AtRS31  and  AtSR34  without the stop codons were amplified by PCR and cloned into the modified pUC19 vector pUC19- 35S-cmGFP4  that expresses GFP under the 35S promoter. To obtain transgenic plants expressing  snc1  cDNA, full-length  snc1  cDNA was amplified from total cDNA of snc1 and cloned into a modified pGreen0229 vector. The cDNA clone was sequenced to make sure the sequence is correct and no intron was retained. To obtain transgenic plants expressing AtSR34-GFP and AtRSZ21-GFP, full-length cDNAs of  AtSR34  and  AtRSZ21  without the stop codons were amplified by PCR and cloned into a modified pCambia1300 vector expressing C-terminal tagged  GFP  under 35S promoter. The constructs were transformed into Col-0 and  mos14-1  through  Agrobacterium -mediated transformation. Yeast two-hybrid analysis To make constructs for the yeast two hybrid assays, an SfiI restriction site was first introduced to
of MOS14 were also cloned into pGADT7a. The plasmids expressing the MOS14 fragments were co-transformed with the vectors expressing AtRAN1 or one of the SR proteins into the yeast strain PJ694α for yeast two-hybrid analysis. Confocal fluorescence microscopy of MOS14-GFP localization For confocal fluorescence microscopy analysis of MOS14-GFP, the roots or leaves of six-day-old seedling grown on MS plates were first stained with propidium iodide (PI) for 1 min and then washed in ddH 2 O for at least three times. The concentration of PI used for staining the roots was 10 µg/ml, whereas the concentration of PI used for the leaves is 10 mg/ml. The stained sample was observed using a Zeiss Meta 510 confocal microscope. Excitation wavelengths for GFP and PI were 488 nm and 543 nm, respectively. For root samples, the emission filter used for PI was LP560 nm. For leaf samples, the emission filter used for PI was BP560 nm-615 nm. For both root and leaf samples, the emission filter for GFP was BP505 nm-530 nm. Confocal fluorescence microscopy of localization of SR-GFPs Plasmids used for protoplast transfections were purified with Invitrogen PureLink™ HiPure Plasmid Filter Purification Kit. Transformation of wild type or  mos14-1  protoplasts was performed as previously described  [38] . After transformation, protoplasts were kept in the
protoplasts were examined using a Zeiss Axiovert 200 fluorescence microscope. The pictures of representative protoplasts were taken using confocal fluorescence microcopy. For autofluorescence, the emission filter used was 650 nm-740 nm. Confocal fluorescence microscopy analysis of transgenic plants expressing AtSR34-GFP and AtRSZ21-GFP was performed on three-week-old seedlings using a procedure described in the analysis of MOS14-GFP localization.
