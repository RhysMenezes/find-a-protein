ABSTRACT:
RESULTS:
proteins (green) and FM4-64 fluorescence (red) were observed under the Laser Scanning Confocal Microscope. Bars, 5µm. In wild-type yeast (W303-1B), AtsKEA1-GFP, AtsKEA2-GFP and AtKEA6-GFP had similar distribution patterns; the fluorescent signals appeared at a structure at or near the plasma membrane and a membrane structure in the cytosol. These structures were not overlapped with FM4-64 ( Figure 10 ). The distribution patterns of AtsKEA1-GFP, AtsKEA2-GFP and AtKEA6-GFP were similar to AtNHX1 ( Figure 10 ). However, AtKEA3-GFP shared similar patterns with ScKHA1; the fluorescent signals appeared at punctate structures ( Figure 10 ). ScKHA1 has been determined to be localized to Golgi [ 64 ], [ 65 ], indicating that AtKEA3-GFP is localized to Golgi in the yeast cells. AtKEA4-GFP shared similar patterns with AtCHX17; the fluorescent signals appeared at a membrane structure in the cytosol that was not overlapped with FM4-64 ( Figure 10 ). AtKEA5-GFP signals appeared at both punctate structures and a membrane structure in the cytosol; neither structure was overlapped with FM4-64 ( Figure 10 ). These patterns suggest that AtKEAs have different distributions in yeast cells.  AtKEA3 is localized to Golgi in Arabidopsis We visualized the subcellular localization of AtKEA3 by transient expression in Arabidopsis protoplasts. Surprisingly, RFP-AtKEA3 fluorescence appeared on punctate structures in the cytosol but not in chloroplasts ( Figure 11A ). RFP-AtKEA3 fluorescent signals were co-localized extensively with the Golgi marker GFP-AtSYP31, suggesting that AtKEA3 is localized to Golgi ( Figure 11B, D ).  10.1371/journal.pone.0081463.g011 Figure 11 AtKEA3 is localized to Golgi in Arabidopsis.

MATERIALS AND METHODS:
were used to calculate the differential gene expression [ 56 ]. The gene-specific primers are listed in  Table S2 .  Localization of the AtKEAs-GFP fusion proteins in yeast To make GFP fusion constructs, we converted the vector pDR196 into a Gateway destination vector pDR196-GFP. GFP was fused at the C-terminal of plant or yeast proteins. Gene fragments of AtKEAs, AtNHX1 and AtCHX17 were amplified by PCR from Arabidopsis cDNAs (primers are listed in  Table S3 ). To make GFP fusion constructs for ScNHX1 and ScKHA1, gene fragments were amplified by PCR from the genomic DNA isolated from the  Saccharomyces cerevisiae  strain BJ3505 (primers are listed in  Table S3 ). PCR fragments were inserted into the plasmid pDR196-GFP using the Gateway technology (Invitrogen), respectively. Gene fragments were verified by sequencing. The recombinant plasmids were transformed into the yeast strain W303-1B. Yeast cells grown to logarithmic phase at 30°C in SC-URA medium adjusted to pH 5.8. For FM4-64
times with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and concentrated by centrifugation. After mixing with 0.6% agarose, the cells were mounted on glass slides and observed by a confocal laser scanning microscope (FV1000, Olympus) [ 57 ].  Localization of the RFP-AtKEA3 fusion protein in Arabidopsis protoplasts Transient expression assay using protoplasts derived from the leaf mesophyll cells of Arabidopsis were performed as described [ 58 ]. RFP gene was fused in frame to AtKEA3 at its N-terminus. The AtKEA3 gene was amplified by using the following primers:  5′-AAAAAGCAGGCTTCATGGCAATTAGTACTATGTT-3′  and  5′-AGAAAGCTGGGTCTTAATCTTGAGCTTTATCAG -3′ . The PCR fragment was inserted into the plasmid pUBN-RFP [ 59 ] using the Gateway technology (Invitrogen). Protoplasts were co-transfected with pUBN-RFP-AtKEA3 and a cis-Golgi marker GFP-AtSYP31. Arabidopsis seedlings of 4 weeks old were used for protoplast isolation. Fluorescence was visualized by a confocal laser scanning microscope (FV1000, Olympus). Localization of the AtKEA3-GFP fusion protein in stably transformed  Arabidopsis  seedlings For the stable transformation assays with  Arabidopsis thaliana , the GFP gene was fused in frame to AtKEA3 at its C-terminus. The AtKEA3 gene was amplified by using the following primers:  5′-AAAAAGCAGGCTTCATGGCAATTAGTACTATGTT-3′  and  5′-AGAAAGCTGGGTCATCTTGAGCTTTATCAGC-3′ . The PCR fragment was inserted in plasmid pBIB-EGFP using the Gateway technology (Invitrogen), and the resulting construct was transformed into  Agrobacterium tumefaciens  GV3101.  Arabidopsis thaliana  (ecotype Columbia) wild-type plants were transformed [ 60 ].
seedlings were re-confirmed with PCR amplification of the GFP fragment. GFP fluorescence was visualized under a confocal laser scanning microscope (FV1000, Olympus). The excitation wavelength for EGFP detection was 488 nm. The roots of the transgenic seedlings containing the 35S-AtKEA3-EGFP fusion protein were visualized under the confocal microscope.
