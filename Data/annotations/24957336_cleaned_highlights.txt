ABSTRACT:
RESULTS:
line ( LYS1 KD -1 , see  Figure 3 ) and wild-type plants. Total leaf protein was separated by SDS-PAGE and blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane. Immunodetection was carried out using α-tobacco class III chitinase (α-Chit) or green fluorescent protein (α-GFP) (both from rabbit) and an anti-rabbit HRP-coupled secondary antibody. Ponceau S red staining of the large subunit of RuBisCO served as loading control. (
MATERIALS AND METHODS:
Brock et al., 2010 ). T-DNA insertion lines for  LYS1  ( lys1-1 , WiscDsLox387C11;  lys1- 2, SALK_095362;  lys1-3 , CSHL_ET14179) were obtained from the Nottingham Arabidopsis Stock Centre. The transgenic  pPR1::GUS  and  secGFP  lines and the  lym1 lym3  and  cerk1-2  mutants have been described previously ( Shapiro and Zhang, 2001 ;  Teh and Moore, 2007 ;  Willmann et al., 2011 ). Rice ( Oryza sativa ) suspension cell cultures were grown in MS-medium (4.41 g/l MS
Gateway adaptor primers attB1 and attB2 (Invitrogen, Darmstadt, Germany). The resulting fragments were then subcloned into pDONR201 (Invitrogen) by using the BP clonase reaction according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Invitrogen) and inserted into the binary expression vectors pK7FWG2.0 (C-terminal GFP-tag) ( Karimi et al., 2002 ,  2005 ) or pGWB17 (C-terminal myc-tag) ( Nakagawa et al., 2007 ) by using the LR clonase reaction following the manufacturer’s protocol (Invitrogen).

Stable transgenic lines were generated using standard  Agrobacterium tumefaciens -mediated gene transfer by the floral dip procedure ( Clough and Bent, 1998 ). Expression of GFP fusion proteins was confirmed by immunoblot analysis using an anti-GFP antibody (Acris Antibodies GmbH) and anti-tobacco class III chitinase antibody (kindly provided by Michel Legrand, IBMP Strasbourg, France). The histochemical detection of β-glucuronidase (GUS) enzyme activity in whole leaves of  pLYS1::GUS  or  pPR-1::GUS  transgenic Arabidopsis
LYS1 activity with the 4-MUCT assay and protein purification was further confirmed by SDS-PAGE. 4-MUCT-active fractions were pooled and exchanged to buffer A using Vivaspin 3 kDa columns (GE Healthcare). Protein concentration was determined using the Bradford assay. For LC-MS analysis, the Coomassie Blue-stained band of the major cleavage product of the purified
Mass tolerance was set to 6 parts per million (ppm) at the precursor ion and 20 ppm at the fragment ion level. Identified peptide spectrum matches (PSM) were statistically scored by MaxQuant software by calculation of posterior error probabilities (PEP) ( Käll et al., 2008 ) for each PSM. All PSMs having a PEP below 0.01 were considered as valid. For matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS), protein digestion was performed as described elsewhere ( Maurer et al., 2013 ;  Amin et al., 2014 ). Briefly, the Coomassie Blue-stained band of the major cleavage product of the FPLC-purified LYS1-GFP sample was cut from the gel
grade trypsin (Promega, Manheim, Germany) at 37°C. The digests were acidified by the addition of trifluoric acid (TFA) to a final concentration of 0.5%. Extracted peptides were desalted and mixed with an equal volume of 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid for Reflex-IV MALDI-TOF-MS (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany) measurements. Each spectrum was processed internally for trypsin autolysis before database search. The identity of protein was annotated using the SwissProt database (542782 sequences; 193019802 residues). To achieve the best possible results, the search parameters
