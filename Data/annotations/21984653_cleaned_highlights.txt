ABSTRACT:
to function. Two COG0354 proteins were identified in  Arabidopsis  and many other plants, one (At4g12130) related to those of α-proteobacteria and predicted to be mitochondrial, the other (At1g60990) related to those of cyanobacteria and predicted to be plastidial. Grasses and poplar appear to lack the latter. The predicted subcellular locations of the  Arabidopsis  proteins were validated by  in vitro  import assays with purified

MATERIALS AND METHODS:
out with MEGA version 4.0 ( Tamura  et al. , 2007 ). Organellar targeting was predicted using TargetP ( http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TargetP/ ), WoLF PSORT ( http://wolfpsort.org/ ), and Predotar ( http://urgi.versailles.inra.fr/predotar/predotar.html ). Ambiguous (mitochondrial/plastidial) targeting was evaluated using the COSMOSS Ambiguous Targeting Predictor ( http://www.cosmoss.org/bm/ATP ). Plant materials and growth conditions Arabidopsis thaliana  (ecotype Col-0) seeds were sterilized, imbibed at 4 °C for 5 d, and germinated on 0.5× MS salts containing 0.5% (w/v) sucrose. Seedlings were transferred after 14 d either into potting soil and
16–18 °C under fluorescent light (75 μmol quanta m −2  s −1 ) with a 12 h photoperiod for 11 d. In vitro  organellar import assays For dual import assays ( Rudhe  et al. , 2002 ), cDNAs encoding full-length At4g12130 and At1g60990
 et al. , 2002 ) and pine phenylalanine hydroxylase ( Pribat  et al. , 2010 ) served as positive controls for mitochondrial and chloroplast targeting, respectively. Transient expression of GFP fusion proteins The N-terminal 126 residues of At4g12130 or 122 residues At1g60990 were fused, via a tetraglycine linker, upstream and in-frame with green fluorescent protein (GFP) as follows. The first 378 bp of  At4g12130  or 366 bp of  At1g60990  were amplified from cDNAs (ABRC stock no. U17502 and Riken stock no. RAFL21-91-J21, respectively) using primers At4g12130-GFP-fwd and -rev, and At1g60990-GFP-fwd and -rev, respectively ( Supplementary Table S1  at  JXB  online). Amplicons were digested with appropriate restriction enzymes and ligated into pTH2 ( Niwa, 2003 ). Protoplasts were prepared from suspension culture cells of  Arabidopsis 
2008 ) before Nucleobond AXR 400 column chromatography purification (Macherey-Nagel, Germany). The purified tRNA was then hydrolysed and analysed by liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) as described ( Phillips  et al. , 2008 ). Knockout mutant of  At4g12130  and complementation A T-DNA mutant for  At4g12130  (Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center stock no. SAIL_646_F03) was identified in the GABI-Kat collection (
progeny of a backcross of a heterozygote to the wild type, the BASTA resistance marker was shown to co-segregate with the At4g12130 mutation, indicating the absence of inserts at other loci. BASTA resistance was scored on plates containing 0.5× MS salts, 0.5% (w/v) sucrose, and 10 μg ml −1  BASTA. For complementation, a full  At4g12130  genomic clone with 2000 bp of upstream promoter sequence and flanking  Not I sites was amplified using primers At4g12130-COM-fwd and -rev (
