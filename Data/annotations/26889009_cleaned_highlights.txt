ABSTRACT:
RESULTS:
expression of TPR5 during each cell cycle stage further, we visualized DNA by DAPI staining and observed TPR5–GFP localization in meristematic epidermal cells ( Fig. 7 ). During interphase and prophase of cell division, TPR5–GFP was observed in the cytosol but not inside nuclei. From metaphase to telophase, TPR5–GFP was uniformly localized in cells including the area where chromosomes were observed. Fig. 7. Subcellular localization of TPR5–GFP fusion protein during cell division. Three DAG seedlings of transformants expressing TPR5–GFP (genetically identical to  tpr5-2 TPR5 (genomic)– GFP  L1 in  Fig. 4 ) were observed using confocal microscopy. DNA was stained with DAPI and root meristematic epidermal cells in each cell division phase were observed. Bar: 5 µm. Micronuclei were frequently observed in  tpr5
MATERIALS AND METHODS:
 tpr5-2  (for the complementation test) or Col-0 (for promoter–GUS analysis) plants were transformed with these cultures using the floral dipping method ( Clough and Bent, 1998 ). The transformed plants were selected on half-strength Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium
μg ml –1  PI solution and observed after 15min. Fluorescence from PI was observed using a confocal laser scanning microscope FV1000 or FV1200 (Olympus). The wavelengths for excitation and emission were 559nm and 570–670nm, respectively. For observation of GFP fluorescence of transgenic plants, roots were mounted with water and observed using 473nm and 510nm for excitation and emission, respectively. For DNA staining, roots were fixed in 4% (w/v) formaldehyde in PBS (137mM NaCl, 2.68mM KCl, 8.1mM Na 2
0.5% Triton X-100/PBS for 10min. The seedlings were then mounted with 1/2× mounting medium as described in  Hayashi  et al.  (2013) . Fluorescence emitted from Alexa Fluor 594 and SYBR Green I was observed using a fluorescent microscope (IX-81, Olympus) equipped with a confocal scanning unit (CSUX-1, Yokogawa) and a sCMOS camera (Neo 5.5 sCMOS ANDOR Technology). The excitation and emission wavelengths were 561nm and 604–644nm for EdU and 488nm and 503–537nm for SYBR Green I,
