ABSTRACT:
the  axr1  (auxin-resistant) mutation. The present work is focused on AtNUP62, which is essential for embryo and plant development. This protein is one of the three nucleoporins (with AtNUP54 and AtNUP58) of the central channel of the nuclear pore complex. Results AtNUP62  promoter activity was detected in many organs, and particularly in the embryo sac, young germinating seedlings and at the adult stage in stipules of cauline leaves. The  atnup62-1  mutant, harbouring a T-DNA
RESULTS:
observed during germination (2 days after sowing, before the exit of the plantlet from the seed envelope), at the junction between the hypocotyl and cotyledons (Fig.  1i ). At the subcellular level, the AtNUP62-GFP fusion protein was distributed at the nuclear periphery, as expected [ 14 ], with a clear punctuate pattern not previously observed (Fig.  1j ). The same  AtNUP62-GFP  construct allowed detecting a broad fluorescence in the cytosol (Fig.  1k ), which might be due to overexpression.

floral dip method [ 45 ]. Transformants were selected on kanamycin, and homozygotes were recovered at the next generation. Beta-glucuronidase activity was detected according to [ 46 ]. Localisation of AtNUP62 protein in protoplasts and plants by fusion with GFP AtNUP62  (At2g45000) cDNA was amplified with oligonucleotides 5′-CACCATGTCGGGGTTTCCATTTGGTC-3′ and 5′-AGACATCCAGTGCTTTGGAGCCA-3′ (ORF 5′ end and 3′ end without Stop codon), and cloned into pENTR/D-TOPO (Invitrogen). The cDNA sequence was introduced by LR recombination (Gateway LR clonase enzyme mix, Invitrogen) into pGWB5 (Tsuyoshi Nakagawa, Shimane University, Japan) in order to fuse GFP to the C-terminus of the AtNUP62 protein (resulting in pGWB5- AtNUP62  plasmid used for plant transformation). Col-0 plants were transformed according to [ 45 ]. For transient expression in protoplasts, the  Hin DIII/ Stu I cassette (including the 35S promoter and GFP-coding sequences) was extracted from pGWB5-AtNUP62 and inserted into pGreen 0179, digested with  Hin DIII and  Eco RV. Fluorescence was detected under a Zeiss confocal microscope (LSM510 AX70 Zeiss, Göttingen, Germany). The excitation was obtained with a Beam
