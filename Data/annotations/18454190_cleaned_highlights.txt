and the mutant was confirmed to be null for  MOT1  expression by RT-PCR ( Figure S2 ). All T-DNA lines analyzed were homozygous for the T-DNA insertion. General Plant Growth Conditions Plants used for elemental profiling by ICP-MS analysis were grown in a controlled environment, 8 h light:16 h dark (90 µmol·m−2·s−1 light intensity) and 19 to 22°C  [6] . Briefly, seeds were sown onto moist soil (Sunshine Mix LB2; Carl Brehob & Son, Indianapolis, Indiana,
digested (83% HNO 3  & 13% (70%) HClO 4 ) and analyzed by ICP-MS (Agilent ICP-MS 7500ce, Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, US)  [28] . Heritability and Association Analysis Broad sense heritability was calculated using a general ANOVA to account for line and growth tray variation.

individual pairs. DNA Microarray-Based BSA DNA microarray-based BSA was realized as previously described  [11] , [31] . Briefly, SFPs were identified between Col-0 and Ler-0 by hybridizing labeled genomics DNA from each one of the accessions to Affymetrix ATH1 microarrays and comparing them to Col-0 hybridizations downloaded from  http://www.naturalvariation.org/xam .

grafted individuals. Individuals with adventitious roots emerging at or above the graft union or without a clear graft union were eliminated from subsequent analyses. Quantitative Real-Time PCR Plants were first analyzed by ICP-MS and further used to determine  MOT1  transcript levels as described previously by Rus et al.,  [10] . For  MOT1  (At2g25680) transcript quantification the following primers were used: forward primer  5′-GGT GGG TGT GTG
MOT1 clones containing approximately 1 kb upstream to the ORF, and approximately 0.250 kb downstream to the ORF were sequenced. The following primers were used to amplify different PCR products spanning the selected genomic region . Forward primers were: FP1  5′-CGA GCA AAC TAG AAA AGA GAT CG-3′ , FP2  5′-CAG GTG TTA GCT GTT TAA CTG-3′ , FP3- 5′-GCG ATT TCG TCT ACC GC-3′  and FP4  5′-GGT TTG GAG CAA TGC C-3′ . The corresponding reverse primers were: RP1  5′-CAA AAA CCA AAG CGT TGA CA-3′ , RP2  5′-GGA CAC CGT AAA CTG C-3′  and RP3  5′-GGG AAG ATG TAG
ATC AGG AAC ATC GTA AGG GTA AGC ATG TTC ACC GGA TTG CGG GGG-3′ ), with an HA tag encoded by the reverse promoter. The fragments were cloned into p416 GPD (-uracil (ura)) (ATCC nos. 87360). Two separate MOT1::GFP fusion protein constructs were cloned, one at Purdue (v1) and one at Rothamsted (v2). To construct the MOT1::GFP(v1) fusion protein,  MOT1  was amplified from cDNA using PCR with  5′-TGC TCT AGA GCA TGG AGT CTC AGT CTC AGA GAG GT-3′  (MOT1, 5′ primer) and  5′-TCC GGA TCC TTC CTC CTC CAG CAT GTT CAC CGG ATT GCG GGG G-3′  (MOT1, 5′ primer) primers. The PCR product was confirmed by sequencing and cloned into the XbaI and BamHI sites of the 326-SGFP plasmid (kindly provide by Inhwan Hwang, POSTECH, Korea) to created chimeric GFP fusion constructs under the control of the 35S promoter. MOT1-Promoter-GUS and 35S-Promoter- MOT1::GFP (v2) Fusion Constructs The use of the two specific oligonucleotide primers  5′-GGA TCC GCA GTC GAG CTT ACC AAT TCT C-3′  and  5′-GGA TCC GAA ACA GAG CAA TAA GCG TAT CTC-3′  allowed isolation of
the BamHI restriction sites in the primer sequences were used for further cloning of the promoter DNA fragment into the BamHI site of the pBI101 vector (Clontech, Mountain View, USA) harboring the promoterless β-glucuronidase gene. For preparation of the MOT1::GFP(v2) construct the full ORF without the stop codon (TGA) was amplified from total cDNA by using the two specific oligonucleotide primers  5′-GGA TCC AAT GGA GTC TCA GTC TCA GAG AG-3′  and  5′-GGA TCC AGC ATG TTC ACC GGA TTG CGG GG-3′ . The Bam HI restriction site replacing the stop codon allowed the cloning of the coding DNA in frame to the GFP gene in the binary vector pBIN19  [33] , which contained the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S-promoter-MCS-GFP cassette. The binary plasmids were transformed into  Agrobacterium tumefaciens  GV3101 (pM P90)  [34]  by the freeze/thaw method. Arabidopsis Col-0 plants were transformed using the floral dip method (Clough and Bent, 1998). Transgenic plants were selected on solidified ½ MS media  [35]  containing 50 mg/l kanamycin sulphate. Kanamycin-resistant homozygous T3 progenies derived from 5 independent transgenic lines were used for analysis. Cloning ST5.1 cDNA Total RNA and first strand cDNA was isolated from Col-0 seedlings as described for qRT-PCR. The first strand cDNA was used as a template to synthesize  ST 5.1  cDNA using the following primers: SpeI-FP  5′-CGA CTA GTA TGG CGG TCG CAA TAT CTG GGA GT-3′  BamHI-HA-3′RP  5′-CGG GAT CCT TAA GCG TAA TCC GGA ACA TCA TAC GGG TAG TTT GCG AGT ATC GGG TT3′ . The reverse primer contained
fragment cloned into p416 GPD (Glycerol 3-phosphate dehydrogenase promoter) using the same restriction enzymes. The ligated products were chemically transformed into  E. coli  DH5 α  and the positive clones were identified using a vector primer (FP- 5′-AAT GGA GTG ATG CAA CCT-3′ ) and the reverse primer BamHI-HA-3′RP HA. Histochemical Staining of MOT1 Promoter-GUS Plants Transgenic Arabidopsis Col-0 plants were germinated and grown vertically on 0.5× MS agar plates containing 1% sucrose. Plants were transferred to 5 cm Petri dishes containing 2–4 ml staining solution, containing 0.05% 5-bromo 4 chloro 3 indolyl
appeared. After straining plant samples were rinsed twice in 70% ethanol for 30 min then in 100% ethanol until chlorophyll was removed. After staining and destaining samples were analysed by optical microscopy. Subcellular Localization of MOT1 in Arabidopsis The MOT1::GFP(v1) construct and a mitochondria marker, F1-ATPase-γ-RFP  [36] , were co-transformed into purified Arabidopsis leaf protoplasts using polyethyleneglycol method  [37] . The protoplasts were incubated for 20 hours at 22°C, and examined under an epi-fluorescence microscope, Nikon Eclipse 80i (Nikon USA, Melville, NY). Images of the mitochondria marker and the green fluorescence of MOT1::GFP were sequentially taken within 1 second in the same cell, because plant mitochondria actively moves along F-actins  [38] . The filter sets used were 31303 for RFP and 31001 for GFP from Chroma Technol Corp (Rockingham, VT). The plants containing stably transformed 35S-Promoter-MOT1::GFP (v2) fusion constructs described above were grown vertically on B5 plates under continuous light for two weeks. The seedlings were harvested, and incubated with 0.2 µM MitoTracker Red CM-H 2 X ROS (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) for 10 min at room temperature, and examined using a confocal microscope, Nikon Eclipse 80i (Nikon USA, Melville, NY) using green HeNe laser line (543 nm) for the GFP and red HeNe laser line (633 nm) for MitoTracker. Functional Characterization of MOT1 in Yeast The MOT1-HA and ST5.1-HA containing plasmids were transferred into the  Saccharomyces cerevisiae  yeast wild-type strain BY4742 ( MATα his3 leu2 lys2 ura3
The filtered culture medium, as well as the original medium, was diluted 50 times but otherwise the matrix prepared in the same manner as the samples. The samples and the media were analyzed on a Perkin Elmer Elan DRC-e ICP-MS coupled with Elemental Scientific SC-2 autosampler and Apex Q nebulizer sample
