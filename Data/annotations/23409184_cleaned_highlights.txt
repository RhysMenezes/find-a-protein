ABSTRACT:
(DIMINUTO/DWARF1) and Δ 5,7 -sterol-Δ 7 -reductase (DWARF5) were fused to the yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) and transformed into  Arabidopsis thaliana  mutant lines deficient in the corresponding enzymes. All fusion proteins were found to localize in the endoplasmic reticulum in functionally complemented plants. The results
RESULTS:
Table 1 ). To experimentally assess whether STE1, DWARF5 and DIM were localized to the ER or to other compartments, we used confocal microscopy to analyse cells from the lower epidermal layer of leaves detached from functionally complemented  dwarf5-2::DWARF5-YFP ,  dim::DIM-YFP  and  ste1-1::STE1-YFP  plants. In accordance with the  in silico  prediction (Supplemental  Table 1 ), the DWARF5-YFP fusion protein showed a clear reticulate structure in confocal observation corresponding to a typical ER localization ( Figure 4A ). This ER localization is consistent with observations reported in the case of the orthologous enzyme 7-dehydrocholesterol reductase (7-DHCR) in mammalian cells  [46] . Moreover we observed a clear signal at the periphery of the epidermal cell ( Figure 4 ). An ER-like pattern was seen for the DIM-YFP fusion protein ( Figure 5A ; Supplemental  Figure 3A ), which also showed a clear signal in the peripheral area ( Figure 5A, 5D ). In both cases the peripheral signal suggests that these proteins are synthesized in the endomembrane system for delivery to the PM  [47] . 10.1371/journal.pone.0056429.g004 Figure 4 Subcellular localization of DWARF5-YFP protein in Arabidopsis  dwarf5-2::DWARF5-YFP  plants.

of these two proteins to the PM, we stained the leaves of transgenic  dwarf5-2  and  dim  plants expressing the DWARF5-YFP ( Figure 4E ) and DIM-YFP ( Figure 5B and 5C ), respectively, with the membrane dye FM4-64. Interestingly, the human 24-DHCR (SELADIN1), as well as the yeast ERG4p, two orthologs of the plant DIM, have been both localized mainly to the ER  [39] ,  [48]  but also to a lesser extent to Golgi complexes  [48] , indicating possible dual localizations for enzymes of this type. Previously, Klahre  et al .  [13]  found a N-terminal GFP-DIM fusion protein localized in speckled structures in the cytoplasm of pollen tubes; this was interpreted as ER. Localization to the Golgi may indicate a possible translocation of this protein to the PM in secretory vesicles. This vesicular transport is
campesterol and consequently the response to environmental changes  [49] . In addition, DIM was already identified as a component of detergent resistant membranes (DRM) or so-called lipid rafts isolated from tobacco PM  [4] . In addition to DWARF5-YFP and DIM-YFP, the STE1-YFP expressed in transformed  ste1-1  mutant plants also displayed an ER-like pattern ( Figure 6A ; Supplemental  Figure 3D ). Surprisingly, for the STE1-YFP fusion we further observed an unexpected localization in small and round structures moving across the cytoplasm (Supplemental Movie 1). As the observed structures resembled LPs
deriving from round bodies dispersed into the cytoplasm ( Figure 6B, 6C, 6D, 6G, 6H ). The localization of STE1-YFP was observed to overlap with Nile Red signals, indicating that STE1-YFP is localized to LPs as well as to ER ( Figure 6D ). 10.1371/journal.pone.0056429.g006 Figure 6 Subcellular localization of STE1-YFP protein in Arabidopsis  ste1-1::STE1-YFP  plants (panel A to D) and Nile Red staining of ste1-1 mutants (panel E to H).

[59] . A mechanism of that type is well known in the case of mammalian cholesterol homeostasis, implicating in particular an extracellular transport of cholesterol through the LDL/LDL receptor machinery  [60] . 10.1371/journal.pone.0056429.g007 Figure 7 Subcellular localization of STE1-YFP protein in Arabidopsis  ste1-1::STE1-YFP  plants.

In conclusion we have shown that C-terminal YFP-fusion proteins of DWARF5, DIM and STE1 were found to localize to the endoplasmic reticulum. Surprisingly, Δ 24 -sterol-Δ 24 -reductase (DIM) was further localized to the plasma membrane, whereas Δ 7 -sterol-C 5 -desaturase (STE1) was also clearly detected
MATERIALS AND METHODS:
Yeast pellets were collected by centrifugation at 4000×g (Laborzentrifugen, Sigma®) of 50 ml of three days-old liquid culture were frozen in liquid nitrogen, freeze dried and stored at −80 °C prior to sterol analysis. ENZYME::YFP constructs The cDNAs encoding DWARF5 (At1g50430), STE1 (At3g02580) and DIM (At3g19820) were obtained from the Arabidopsis Biological Research Centre (ABRC, Ohio, US). Translational fusions of  DWARF5 ,  STE1  and  DIM  to the  YFP  reporter were generated by cloning the corresponding ORFs into a pLIFE001 vector, a modified version of pCAMBIA 2300 plant expression vector suitable for User cloning  [63] . The pLife001 vector contains the
In order to generate the translational fusions necessary for the yeast complementation experiments, the  cDNA-YFP  sequences were amplified from the plant expression vectors with appropriate Gateway® cloning primers (Supplemental Table 3). Amplified sequences were recombined first into pDONR211 (Invitrogen®) and then into episomal yeast expression vectors carrying the desirable selection marker (HIS+ or URA+) under the control of the  GAL1-10  galactose inducible promoter  [65] . The obtained constructs  GAL1-10::DWARF5-YFP  and  GAL1-10::STE1-YFP  were cloned into pMP2360 (URA3+) and  GAL1-10::DIM-YFP  into pMP1965 (HIS3+), which are modified Gateway versions of pRS426-GAL and pRS423-GAL, respectively  [66]  (kindly provided by Dr. Rosa Lopez, University of Copenhagen, DK). Escherichia coli  strain DH10β was used for DNA cloning. Standard cloning

Sterol structures were confirmed by GC-MS (Agilent 6890 gas chromatograph and 5973 mass analyzer) equipped with a HP-5MS glass capillary column (wall coated, open, and tubular; 30 m; 0.25 mm film thickness,

The prediction programs used in this study are Predotar (ver 1.03; INRA/CNRS/UEVE, FR) ( http://urgi.versailles.inra.fr/predotar/predotar.html )  [68]  and SignalP (ver 4.0; CBS, DK) ( http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/SignalP/ )  [69] . Experimental subcellular localization of STE1-YFP, DWARF5-YFP and DIM-YFP was carried out by confocal observation of leaf cells from one-week old seedlings of the respective transformed  ste1-1 ,  dwarf5-2 , and  dim  mutants showing complementation. FM4-64 (T-3166, Invitrogen®) was used for co-localization in the
