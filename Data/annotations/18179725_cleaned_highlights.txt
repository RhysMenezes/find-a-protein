 was constructed and rotated around its axis, it could be distinguished that the dots were scattered around the cells making it difficult to distinguish between membrane and cytoplasmic specific localization (Additional file  1 ). In root hairs, GFP-ATM1(IQ-tail) also formed a pattern of dots (Figure  2D ). Figure 1 Verification of GFP-ATM1(IQ-tail) expression in transgenic plants . A. PCR was performed using a

localization of ATM1 transiently expressed in  N. benthamiana When fluorescent chimeras (GFP or RFP) of ATM1(IQ-tail) were transiently expressed in  N. benthamiana  leaves using Agrobacterium infiltration, fluorescence accumulated as dots (or aggregates of dots) on the plasma membrane of abaxial leaf epidermal cells (Figure  4A ). To verify whether this
was thus interesting to determine whether the dots formed by ATM1 and ATM2 overlap in  N. benthamiana  leaves. GFP-ATM1 and RFP-ATM2 were therefore co-expressed in these leaves, and both localized to the same specific spots on the plasma membrane (Figure  4D–F ). This suggests the existence of specific foci at the plasma membrane that are able to bind both myosins. Interestingly, when the ATM1 fluorescent chimera was co-expressed with an ER marker, ERD2-GFP [ 26 ], the punctate labeling pattern of ATM1 correlated with the ER (Figure  4G–I ). The same picture was observed with ATM2 (not shown). Using aniline blue to stain callose [ 27 ], ATM1 was shown to
ATM1 in endocytosis the membrane dye FM4-64 was used to follow membrane internalization. ATM1 was found not only at the plasma membrane, but also in the cytoplasm where it co-localized with internalized FM4-64 (Figure  5A–C ). In addition, fluorescent chimeras of ATM1 were co-expressed with the endosomal markers ARA6-GFP and GFP-ARA7, Rab5 orthologs from Arabidopsis [ 28 ], and DsRed-FYVE.
and ATM1 (Additional file  6 ), and motionless FYVE labeled bodies surrounded by excess of GFP-ATM1 could be detected (Additional file  7 ). About 80–90% of ARA6 labeled organelles colocalized with ATM1 at or close to the plasma membrane (Figure  5J–L ). Importantly, while ARA6 labeled organelles were highly motile in the absence of GFP-ATM1 (additional file  8 ), in the presence of ATM1, all co-labeled organelles, became motionless and only those free from ATM1 remained

MATERIALS AND METHODS:
temperature-controlled (23°C) greenhouse under continuous light. Nicotiana benthamiana  plants were grown in peat in a controlled growth room at 25°C with optimum light for 16 h daily. Plasmids In order to fuse the IQ-tail domain of ATM1 to GFP, we used a cDNA clone kindly provided by Dieter Volkmann (University of Bonn, Germany) and the following primers: Fwd-GGG GTA CCC GTA CTC TCC ACG GCA TT and Rev-CGG GAT CCG TGC TTG GGA ATG CTG CC. The resulting fragment was ligated downstream of GFP using KpnI and BamHI into the plasmid ART7 containing GFP with a linker of 10XAla at its C terminus. Similarly, ATM1 was ligated to ART7 containing RFP cherry [ 63 ] with a linker of 10XAla at its C terminus. The ATM2 IQ-tail domain was isolated from Arabidopsis RNA using RT-PCR and the following primers: Fwd-GGG GTA CCA GGA AAA AGG TTC TTC AAG GC and Rev-CGG GAT CCC TAG CCT CTT TTT CCC CA. Similar clones of myosin VIIIA were isolated using these primers: Fwd-GGGGTACCCAGA TTGGGGTTCTTGAAGAT, and Rev-CGGGATCCTTAATACCTAGTA CTCCTCAA. And for myosinVIIIB Fwd-GGGGTACCGTAATTAGCG TCCTTGAGGAA, and Rev-CGGGATCCTCAATAACTTTTCTTGCACCA. These were fused to either GFP or RFP as described for ATM1. The entire expression cassettes containing the fluorescent chimeras under the regulation of the 35S promoter were then transferred to the binary vector pART27 using a NotI cleavage. The plasmid encoding DsRED-FYVE was provided by Josef Samaj from the University of Bonn [ 30 ]. Plasmids encoding GFP fusions of ARA7 and ARA6 were provided by Takashi Ueda from RIKEN, Japan [ 28 ]. The plasmid encoding the GFP fusion of the H/KDEL receptor, ERD2-GFP, was provided by Chris Hawes from Oxford Brookes University, UK [ 26 ]. Plant DNA and RNA preparation DNA was prepared as follows: two to three fresh mature leaves were ground in liquid nitrogen to a fine powder and
of Laemmli's protein sample buffer [ 64 ] for 10 min and then centrifuged 10 min at 14 krpm in room temp. A sample (30 μl) of the extract was separated on SDS-PAGE and blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane. GFP fusion proteins were detected with anti GFP antibody (Santa Cruz), and a secondary HRP conjugated antibody (Jacksom ImmunoResearch). For chemiluminescent reaction, the SuperSignal kit (Pierce) was used. Fluorescent microscopy and staining An
