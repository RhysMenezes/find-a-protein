ABSTRACT:
RESULTS:
Figure 5b–d ). Interestingly, at the site of a developing LRP (stage 3), SnRK2.4–YFP accumulated in punctate structures in the LRP ( Figure 5b ). At a later stage of LRP development (stage 6), SnRK2.4–YFP was present in the cytosol of all the LRP cells ( Figure 5c ). Remarkably, enhanced expression was observed in the cortex cells at the side of the developing LRP, which was not observed in the cortex cells on
in  Figure 4 . Relocalization of SnRK2.4–YFP upon salt stress To investigate whether localization of SnRK2.4 or -2.10 would change in response to salt treatment, seedlings were treated with 115 m m  NaCl. SnRK2.4–YFP relocalized from the cytosol to punctate structures within 5 min of salt application in epidermal cells ( Figure 6 ,  Video S1 ). Two minutes after the start of the treatment (first frame), SnRK2.4–YFP was still predominantly cytosolic, but after 15 min most of the SnRK2.4–YFP had moved from the cytosol and accumulated at unknown punctate structures. To confirm that the fusion protein was functional, western analysis and an in-gel kinase assay were performed on the SnRK2.4–YFP-expressing line, which showed that the fusion protein was intact and could be activated
all the pictures were taken with the same confocal settings as used in  Figure 4 . A co-localization study with FM4-64, a lipophilic dye to label membranes, was performed to further investigate the nature of the accumulation of SnRK2.4–YFP ( Figure S4 ). After treatment with the dye for 2 h prior to the 15-min salt stress treatment, co-localization occurred in some of the punctate structures that were closer to the membrane (indicated by the arrows), indicating that SnRK2.4–YFP is targeted to cellular membranes. Biochemical fractionation reveals membrane association of SnRK2.4 and/or SnRK2.10 upon salt stress In order to further confirm the salt-induced recruitment to membranes, endogenous SnRK2.4/SnRK2.10 levels were analysed after subcellular fractionation in control and salt-stressed
MATERIALS AND METHODS:
Isolation of homozygous T-DNA insertion lines and generation of plants expressing YFP and GFP-fusions Homozygous lines were selected by PCR using gene-specific primers for two independent T-DNA insertion lines ( Alonso  et al. , 2003 ) for both SnRK2.4 ( At1g10940 ) and SnRK2.10 ( At1g60940 ) using;  snrk2.4-1  (Salk_080588),
and attB2SnRK2.10 primers ( Table S1 ). The fragments were recombined into pDONR207 using BP clonase (Invitrogen,  http://www.invitrogen.com/ ). All the fragments were verified by sequencing. Subsequently the fragments were recombined into the expression vector pGreen0179 PL Gateway YFP HA using LR clonase (Invitrogen). These constructs were transformed via the  Agrobacterium tumefaciens  strain GV3103 in their respective mutant backgrounds,  snrk2.4-1  and  snrk2.10-2 , through floral dip transformation ( Clough and Bent, 1998 ).
μg ml −1  hygromycin and the plants were allowed to self. Recombinant proteins of the correct size were confirmed by western blot analysis using a αGFP polyclonal antibody (Molecular Probes,  http://www.invitrogen.com/site/us/en/home/brands/Molecular-Probes.html ). For the construction of the GST fusions and 35S::GFP-overexpression lines,  SnRK2.10  and  SnRK2.4  cDNAs were amplified using the specific primer sets R4F and R4R for  SnRK2.10 , and R5F and R5R for  SnRK2.4.  Subsequently,  SnRK2.10  and  SnRK2.4 
recombination sites, and were recombined into pDONR207. The resulting entry vectors were used in LR clonase recombination reactions with pDEST15, to generate GST-SnRK2.10 and GST-SnRK2.4 fusion constructs for expression in  E. coli , or with pK7WGF2, to generate 35S:GFP-SnRK2.10 and 35S:GFP-SnRK2.4 constructs for expression in plants. In-gel kinase assay Arabidopsis thaliana  plants were grown hydroponically ( http://www.araponics.com/ ) for 4 weeks under short-day conditions (light/dark 10 h/14 h, 21°C/70% humidity) with a weekly change of growth medium using the
