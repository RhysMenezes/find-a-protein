ABSTRACT:
RESULTS:
phenotype fully, we were unable consistently to detect or localize GFP fluorescence in transgenic seedlings. Interestingly, AtDUF177A has thus far been detected in chloroplast stroma proteomes of  clpr4-1  and  clpc1  mutants that are deficient in plastid ClpPR protease ( Kim  et al. , 2009 ) though not in the wild-type, suggesting that AtDUF177A accumulation may be limited by protein turnover. As an alternative approach, subcellular localization of the AtDUF177A–GFP fusion protein was analyzed by
with the predicted localization, confocal microscope imaging showed that GFP fluorescence from AtDUF177A–GFP co-localized with chlorophyll autofluorescence in the  N. benthaminana  mesophyll protoplasts ( Fig. 8 ). There is some evidence that ribosome assembly is associated with plastid nucleoids ( Majeran  et al. , 2012 ;  Bohne, 2014
MATERIALS AND METHODS:
PCR using forward and reverse primers, 5′-GATAAACGCTTGATAAATTGCCTCTT/CAGTAACACCAACAAGATGAAGATG-3′ for the wild-type allele, 5′-GTTTGCTCTTTATCTTGTGTAGCTC/CAGTAACACCAACAAGATGAAGATG-3′ for the T-DNA insertion allele, and 5′-ATGTAACTGTGAAGTCTCGATACCC/AAGAAGATGGTGCGCTCCTGGACGTAG-3′ for detection of transgenes. Transgene expression was confirmed in independent lines by RT-PCR using primer pair, 5′-CACCATGTCTCTGGTTTGCTCTTTATC/CTTGTACAG CTCGTCCATGC-3′. To construct 35S-AtDUF177A–GFP for transient expression, a cDNA containing the AtDUF177A-coding region was amplified from leaf total RNA by PCR with primers, 5′-CACCATGTCTCTGGTTTGCTCTTTATC/GTTCCTTAGTCCCTCTTTTTGTTGC-3′, and cloned in a pGWB505 binary Gateway vector. Subcellular localization of AtDUF177A–GFP in tobacco leaf protoplasts For subcellular localization of AtDUF177A–GFP, an overnight culture of  A. tumefaciens  GV3101 cells transformed with 35S-AtDUF177A–GFP was pelleted by centrifugation and suspended in inducing buffer (10mM MES, pH 5.6, 10mM MgCl 2 , 200 µM acetosyringone) to an OD 600  of 0.1. Cells were injected into tobacco leaf epidermis with a syringe. Mesophyll protoplasts
