ABSTRACT:
known about function, localisation and regulation of this gene family. Only one protein has been characterized as a carnitine transporter at the plasma membrane so far. Findings We localized the five uncharacterized members of the Arabidopsis OCT family, designated OCT2-OCT6, via GFP fusions and protoplast transformation to the tonoplast. Expression analysis with RNA Gel Blots showed a distinct, organ-specific expression pattern of the
RESULTS:
] were used. To discover the subcellular distribution we fused the open reading frames of all the family members translationally to GFP and expressed the proteins transiently in protoplasts. As a control, AtOCT1 was used for localization to the plasma membrane as shown before [ 7 ]. As expected, AtOCT1 ended up in the plasmamembrane, whereas all the other five members
tonoplast localisation an osmotic shock was applied to release the vacuoles from the protoplasts. In the right part of figure  1 , tonoplast pictures or tonoplasts escaping from the vacuoles are shown. For all five fusion proteins of AtOCT2-6-GFP the signal is associated with the tonoplast.

GFP protein under the control of the CaMV 35S promoter were used as control. GFP fluorescence was detected throughout the cytosol. The GFP fluorescence (left panel) and the bright field image (middle panel) were overlayed in the right panel. AtOCT1-GFP fluorescence was detected at the plasma membrane as shown before [ 7 ]. Fusion proteins of AtOCT2-AtOCT6-GFP were localized at membranes in the protoplasts, most probably at the tonoplast. Right part: To confirm the assumed vacuolar localisation, vacuoles were released by an osmotic shock from the protoplasts. GFP signal of the fusion proteins of AtOCT2-AtOCT6-GFP is detected at the free vacuole or at vacuoles just escaping from the protoplasts. Free GFP signal is localised to the cytosol. Organ and tissue specific expression of the  AtOCTs RNA-gel blot analysis showed an expression of the
MATERIALS AND METHODS:
for 16 h using the cDNAs of AtOCTs and actin as a probe. Filters were washed twice with 2 × SSC/0.1% SDS and 0.2 × SSC/0.1% SDS for 20 min at 65°C and exposed to X-ray films DNA-Work Green fluorescent Protein (GFP) fusion The RT-PCR amplified ORFs of  AtOCTs  were cloned behind the CaMV 35S promoter in front to GFP5 (S65T). Restricition sites used were for  AtOCT1(At1g73220), AtOCT2(At1g79360) ,  AtOCT5(At1g79410) SacI / Bam HI, for  AtOCT6(At1g16370) ,  AtOCT3(At1g16390) Bam HI/ Bsp HI and  AtOCAT4 (At3g20660) KpnI / Bsp HI, The linker between the AtOCTs and GFP was 7–8 amino acids (WGIQGDII for AtOCT1, AtOCT2, and AtOCT5, WGAGAGV for AtOCT6 and AtOCT3 and YGAGAGVfor AtOCT4).
