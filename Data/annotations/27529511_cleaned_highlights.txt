ABSTRACT:
development and a T-DNA mutant lacking  PI4Kγ5 ,  pi4kγ5 –1, presents serrated leaves, which is resulted from the accelerated cell division and increased auxin concentration at serration tips. Studies revealed that PI4Kγ5 interacts with and phosphorylates a membrane-bound NAC transcription factor, ANAC078. Previous studies demonstrated that membrane-bound transcription factors regulate gene transcription by undergoing proteolytic process to translocate into nucleus, and ANAC078 undergoes proteolysis by cleaving off the transmembrane region and carboxyl terminal. Western blot analysis indeed showed that ANAC078 deleting of carboxyl terminal is significantly reduced in  pi4kγ5–1 , indicating that PI4Kγ5 is important for the cleavage of ANAC078. This is consistent with the subcellular localization observation showing that fluorescence by GFP-ANAC078 is detected at plasma membrane but not nucleus in  pi4kγ5–1  mutant and that expression of ANAC078 deleting of carboxyl terminal, driven by PI4Kγ5 promoter, could rescue the leaf serration defects of  pi4kγ5–1 . Further analysis showed that ANAC078 suppresses the auxin synthesis by directly
ANAC078 to negatively regulate auxin synthesis and hence influences cell proliferation and leaf development, providing informative clues for the regulation of  in situ  auxin synthesis and cell division, as well as the cleavage and functional mechanism of membrane-bound
RESULTS:

The PI4Kγ5-ANAC078 interaction was confirmed by examining the α-Gal activity ( Fig 5A ) and further firefly luciferase complementation assay  in planta  ( Fig 5B ). In addition, transient expression of RFP-PI4Kγ5 and GFP-ANAC078 fusion proteins in  Arabidopsis  protoplasts showed that RFP-PI4Kγ5 and GFP-ANAC078 partially co-localize with each other at cell membrane and nucleus ( Fig 5C ). 10.1371/journal.pgen.1006252.g005 Fig 5 PI4Kγ5 interacts with a membrane-bound TF ANAC078  in planta  and phosphorylates ANAC078  in vitro .

Being consistent, additional observation of the localization of GFP-ANAC078 in WT or  pi4kγ5–1  mutant showed that the fluorescence was detected in plasma membrane and nucleus in WT serration, while the fluorescence was observed in plasma membrane only in serration of  pi4kγ5–1  mutant ( Fig

 Biological Resource Center (ABRC). The  Arabidopsis  line harbouring  pYUC4 :: GUS  [ 21 ] was kindly provided by Prof. Yunde Zhao at UCSD. Seeds were surface-sterilized and sown on plates containing Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium (Duchefe Biochemie, The Netherlands). After stratification at 4°C for 4 days,

For expression of  cMyc-ANAC078  in WT or  pi4kγ5–1 , coding sequence of  ANAC078  was amplified (primers ANAC078-7/ANAC078-8) and subcloned into a modified pEGAD-4XcMyc vector with N-terminal fusion. For expression of  GFP-ANAC078  in WT or  pi4kγ5–1 , coding regions of  ANAC078  (primers ANAC078-5 and ANAC078-6) was amplified and subcloned into vector pA7 (N-terminus fusion with GFP), resulting in the GFP-ANAC078 fusion constructs.
