MATERIALS AND METHODS:
The construct was then transformed into Arabidopsis plants, and the resultant T 3  homozygous transgenic  PCA22  RNAi lines ( ri14  and  ri27 ) were evaluated for ABA and abiotic stress sensitivity. Localization of PCA22–green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion proteins in transgenic plants To analyze the subcellular localization of the PCA22 protein in transgenic Arabidopsis, the  PCA22  cDNA fragment was amplified using the following primers: 5'-GGGGACAAGTTTGTACAAAAAA GCAGGCTTCATGAACGAAGAGGAGAGAGTTGG-3' and 5'-GGGGACCACTTTGTACAAGAAAGCTGGGTCAC AAAGGCAACCACAACATCTCT-3' on the basis of the
database (NCBI,  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov ). PCR products were inserted into the pEarleyGate103 vector under the control of the constitutive 35S promoter. The nucleotide sequence of the new construct was confirmed by DNA sequencing. To determine the intracellular localization of PCA22–GFP fusion proteins in transgenic plants, root samples were mounted on microscope slides and observed using a FluoView1000 confocal microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). Confocal images were obtained and processed using FV10-ASW 1.7A computer software (Olympus). Measurement of pollen tube elongation
