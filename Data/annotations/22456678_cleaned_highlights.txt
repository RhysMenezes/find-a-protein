ABSTRACT:
RESULTS:
Results AT14A protein mainly localizes in plasma membrane To investigate the biological activity of  AT14A  transformants, the expression and localization of AT14A–GFP fusion protein was first studied using immunoblotting analysis and fluorescence microscopy in  Arabidopsis  cells ( Fig. 1 ). The total proteins
and the  at14a  mutant. To ascertain the subcellular localization of AT14A, the localization of GFP in transforming  Arabidopsis  suspended cells was also studied ( Fig. 1B ). The GFP fluorescence was detected mainly in the plasma membrane of  AT14A–GFP -over-expressed suspended cells. As a control, suspended cell lines of the wild type only over-expressing a  GFP  reporter gene were also established and the GFP was detected not only in the plasma membrane but all over the cytoplasm. As an additional control, suspended cell lines of the mutant  at14a-1  expressing an AT14A–GFP fusion protein were also established. The GFP fluorescence was also detected in the plasma membrane, while the GFP was detected all over the cytoplasm in mutant cells only expressing a GFP protein derived by the  35S  promoter. No GFP fluorescence was detected in Columbia and the mutant  at14a-1  (data not shown). These results clearly indicated that AT14A protein is a membrane protein. Fig. 1.

MATERIALS AND METHODS:
thaliana  used in this study is Columbia (Col-0). The T-DNA insertion mutant  at14a-1  (SALK_101761) was obtained from ABRC. The primary callus cultures were raised from seeds. Established calli were grown on a half-strength Murashige and Skoog (MS) solidified medium containing 1 μg ml −1  2 ,  4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2, 4-D) and 0.5 μg ml −1
made using Gateway technology (Invitrogen). Binary constructs used in this work were made using the pGWB5 vector (Invitrogen) containing the kanamycin and hygromycin resistance gene and the green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter gene. The gene encoding  Arabidopsis  AT14A was inserted into the pGWB5 vector between the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter and the  GFP  reporter gene. The resulting plasmid was used for transformation of  Agrobacterium tumefaciens  strain GV3101.  Arabidopsis thaliana  transformations were obtained by co-cultivating the suspended cells with  Agrobacterium . All transgenic cell lines contain the  AT14A: GFP  or the  GFP  reporter only. Immunoblot analysis Crude extracts were prepared from  Arabidopsis  callus cells. About 500 mg (fresh weight) calli were ground in 500 μl of extraction buffer [20 mmol l −1  TRIS-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mmol l −1  ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), 1 mmol l −1  phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride (PMSF), 5 mmol l −1  ethyleneglycol- bis (2-aminoethoxy)-tetraacetic acid (EGTA), 10 mmol l −1  dithiothreitol (DTT), and 0.05% sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS)] and centrifuged at 20 000  g  for 20 min to remove debris.

then blocked with 5% dry milk in TBST (50 mmol l −1  TRIS-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mmol l −1  NaCl, and 0.05% Tween-20) for 1 h at 37 °C, and then incubated with the first antibody against GFP (rabbit IgG anti-GFP, Epitomics, E-385) at a dilution of 1:10 000 in 5% dry milk-TBST for O/N at 4 °C. The second antibody used was a horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-rabbit antibody with a 1:10 000 dilution. After three 10 min washes with shaking,
