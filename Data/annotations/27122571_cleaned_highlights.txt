ABSTRACT:
RESULTS:
16 spots were analysed by MS ( Supplemantary Table S2 ) and all revealed the expected identifications (see the 2D BN/SDS GelMap of the Arabidopsis mitochondrial proteome for comparison,  https://gelmap.de/1227 ). Fig. 2. Comparative analysis of the mitochondrial membrane proteomes of Arabidopsis wt and  ca1ca2  lines. Mitochondria were isolated as described in the Materials and methods. Mitochondrial membrane proteins were separated by 2D BN/SDS PAGE and proteins were stained by colloidal Coomassie (A). Three replicates were produced per fraction and used for the calculation of a master gel (Delta 2D software package, Decodon, Germany) (B). The molecular
of the mitochondrial membrane proteomes of mutant and wt cell lines was carried out based on 2D BN/SDS DIGE ( Fig. 3 ,  Supplemantary Table S3 ). Spots differing in volumes between the two fractions were analysed by MS. After applying a
differential gel electrophoresis (DIGE). Mitochondria were isolated as described in the Materials and Methods. Mitochondrial membrane proteins of wt and  ca1ca2  were labeled with different CyDyes and separated by 2D BN/SDS PAGE. Proteins were stained by colloidal Coomassie (A). The same gel was used for fluorescence detection of the two CyDyes (B). The
MATERIALS AND METHODS:
under the following conditions: 8h of light (120 µmol s −1  m −2 )/16h of dark, 22 °C, 65% humidity, atmospheric CO 2  concentrations. Homozygous  ca1ca2  mutants were germinated and rescued by cultivation on 0.5 MS medium containing 3% (w/v) sucrose. After 6 weeks plants were transferred to soil and cultivation was continued under the same conditions without
PAGE was carried out using the High Performance Electrophoresis (HPE) FlatTop Tower-System (Serva Electrophoresis) using precast Tris-Glycine gels (12.5% polyacrylamide, 24 x 20cm). Gels were fixed for 2h in 15% (v/v) ethanol, 10% (v/v) acetic acid and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue G250 ( Neuhoff  et al. , 1985 ,  1990 ). Comparative proteome analyses were based on gel triplicates and data evaluation using the Delta 2D software 4.3 (Decodon, Greifswald, Germany) according to  Berth 
the MicrOTOF-Q II mass spectrometer (Bruker Bremen, Germany). MS primary data were evaluated using the Proteinscape software package (version 2.1, Bruker, Bremen, Germany), the Mascot Search Engine (Matrix Science, London, UK), the Arabidopsis protein database ( www.arabidopsis.org ; release TAIR10), and an updated version of a complex I database ( Klodmann  et al. , 2010 ) that represents a subset of the Arabidopsis TAIR10 database. The threshold Mascot Score was set to 30 or 60 for proteins and 20 for peptides. Label-free quantitative shotgun mass spectrometry Sample preparation for ESI-MS/MS Total proteins of five biological replicates of wt and  ca1ca2  leaves were extracted. Then 50 µg of protein were solubilized in 2× sample buffer [4% (w/v) SDS, 125mM Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 20% (v/v) glycerol, and 0.5% (w/v)
glycine/SDS gel [10% (w/v) acrylamide in stacking gel, 14% (w/v) in separation phase]. To concentrate proteins in a single band the gel run was stopped when the BPB front reached the end of the stacking gel. Gels were then Coommassie-stained and the protein bands were extracted and transferred into low-binding Eppendorf caps (Eppendorf, Wesseling-Berzdorf, Germany). After drying in a vacuum centrifuge (Eppendorf, Wesseling-Berzdorf, Germany), gel pieces were
adding 40 µl of 50% (v/v) ACN, 1% (v/v) FA, and then 100% (v/v) ACN afterwards. The supernatants for each sample were pooled in the same Eppendorf tubes and subsequently dried using a vacuum centrifuge at 30 °C. For mass spectrometry peptides were absorbed in 20 µl 2% (v/v) ACN, 0.1% (v/v) FA. ESI-MS/MS Tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) analysis was performed by means of a Q-Exactive (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Dreieich, Germany) mass spectrometer coupled to an Ultimate 3000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Dreieich, Germany) UPLC. Seven microliters of sample solution were drawn from 0.25-ml glass insert vials (Sun-SRI, Rockwood, TN, US) kept at 8 °C in the sample compartment and stored in
of 35 °C. To clean the column, the ACN concentration was subsequently raised to 95% (v/v) within 10min, where it was kept for another 15min before column equilibration to 2% (v/v) ACN commenced. Transfer of eluted peptides into the mass spectrometer was achieved by means of a NSI source (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Dreieich, Germany) using stainless steel nano-bore emitters (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Dreieich, Germany) connected to the column outlet by a 50-cm, 0.05mm ID fused silica capillary. During MS analysis spray voltage was set to 2.2kV, capillary
RF level to 50%. The MS was run in positive ion mode, MS/MS spectra (top 10) were recorded from 30 mins to 220min. For full MS scans, the number of microscans was set to 1, resolution to 70 000, AGC target to 1e6, maximum injection time to 400ms, number of scan ranges to 1, scan range to 400–1600 m/z, and spectrum data type to ‘profile’. For dd-MS2, the number of microscans was set to 1, resolution to 17 500, AGC target to 1e5, maximum injection time to 250ms, Loop count to 10, MSX count to 1, isolation window to 3.0 m/z, fixed first mass to 100.0 m/z, NCE to 27.0 (stepped NCE deactivated), and spectrum data type to ‘profile’.

MS/MS data were queried against an in-house TAIR10 database, modified to also include common contaminants (keratin, trypsin), MS-standards (BSA, fibrinopeptide) and known modifications of mitochondrial encoded proteins based on RNA-editing (AGIs) using Proteome Discoverer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Dreieich, Germany).

The S/N threshold was set to 1.5. For Mascot, the number of maximum missed cleavage sites was limited to
mass tolerance to 10 ppm, and fragment mass tolerance to 0.8Da. Allowed variable modifications were oxidation of methionine residues and N-terminal acetylations. Carbamidomethylation of cysteine residues was selected as fixed modification. For the target decoy PSM validator, strict target FDR was set to 0.01, while 0.05 was
