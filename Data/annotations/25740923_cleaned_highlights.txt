RESULTS:
MATERIALS AND METHODS:
lines─harbouring a T-DNA insertion in the  EX1  (At4g33630) and  EX2  (At1g27510) genes, respectively─were purchased from NASC (Nottingham Arabidopsis Stock Center) ( Alonso  et al. , 2003 ). Plants were grown on soil or on MS basal salt medium. Genomic DNA was isolated from leaf material using the CTAB extraction protocol adapted from  Weigel (2002)  and screened for T-DNA insertion by PCR genotyping. The following genomic primers were used:  EX1  forward gene specific primer (FP; 5′-CACTCCCTCCTCCAAAAGATC-3′) and  EX1  reverse gene specific primer (RP; 5′-TACCCCAATCACTCAAATTGG-3′) to characterize insertion lines SALK_002088;  EX2 -FP (5′-CACTAAGCT TGTCATCGGAGG-3′) and  EX2 -RP (5′-AAATGTCAATGTG GCTGGAAC - 3′), to characterize insertion lines SALK_021694. In these experiments, the T-DNA–specific left border (LB) primer LB (5′-ATTTTGCCGATTTCGGAAC-3′) was also used. To verify PCR products and T-DNA insertion sites, amplified DNA
(w/v) iodoacetamide. Strips were applied on top of 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and sealed in place using 0.5% (w/v) agarose. Second dimension separation was performed using an Ettan Daltsix electrophoresis unit (GE Healthcare). Preparative samples for spot picking and subsequent mass spectrometry analysis, corresponding to 500 µg of protein per
neat acetonitrile twice. Dried gel plugs were rehydrated on ice with 20mM ammonium hydrogen carbonate and 10% acetonitrile containing 2ng/µl trypsin (Promega). In-gel digestion was performed overnight at 37°C. Mass spectrometry analysis of in-gel digests was performed on a MALDI-TOF Voyager-DE™ STR Bio Spectrometry Workstation (Applied Biosystems). Database searches were performed on a local Mascot server licensed to Umeå University by Matrixscience ( www.matrixscience.com ), using  Arabidopsis  TAIR9 and Swiss-Prot databases. For searches a peptide mass error tolerance of 50ppm was accepted and carbamidomethylation of cysteine and oxidation of methionine were specified as variable modifications. Chlorophyll fluorescence measurements   In vivo  chlorophyll  a  fluorescence was measured using a Dual-PAM-100 chlorophyll fluorescence
