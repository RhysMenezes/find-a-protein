ABSTRACT:
The voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC), a major outer mitochondrial membrane protein, is thought to play an important role in energy production and apoptotic cell death in mammalian systems. However, the function of VDACs in plants is largely unknown. In order to determine the individual function of plant VDACs, molecular
RESULTS:
MATERIALS AND METHODS:
16 h light/8 h dark photoperiod on 1/2 MS ( Murashige and Skoog, 1962 ) agar medium containing 1% sucrose. Plants were also grown on soil in a growth room under the same light regime at 22 °C. Transgenic plants carrying  VDAC  promoter-–GUS constructs Herein, At3g01280, At5g67500,
samples were further incubated in the same solution for 16 h, fixed in 70% ethanol, and then observed by light microscopy. Construction of green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion plasmids and microscopic observation in onion cells The coding regions of  VDAC1 – VDAC4  were amplified by PCR. The  VDAC1-m2  and  VDAC2-M1  fragments were amplified by three-step PCR, and those of 
VDAC1P-223H were digested with  Xho I and  Kpn I, while those encoding VDAC2, VDAC2-M1, and VDAC2-H223P were digested with  Xba I and  Kpn I. The resulting fragments were subcloned into the corresponding sites of the pGFP-2 vector, yielding pAtVDAC1-GFP, pAtVDAC2-GFP, pAtVDAC3-GFP, pAtVDAC4-GFP, pAtVDAC1-m2-GFP, pAtVDAC2-M1-GFP, pAtVDAC1-P223H-GFP, and pAtVDAC2-H223P-GFP, respectively. Constructs containing two mitochondrial markers, pmtGFP and pmtmCherry, were generated. The fragments encoding intact mCherry and truncated F 0 F 1 ATPase [nucleotide positions 1 (the first nucleotide of the start codon) to 228, abbreviated in this study as ‘mt’] were amplified by PCR with the appropriate primer pairs. The fragment encoding F 0 F 1 ATPase (1–228) was digested with  Xho I and  Kpn I, and cloned into the corresponding sites of the pGFP-2 vector, resulting in pmtGFP. The mCherry-encoded fragment was verified by DNA sequencing. The GFP portion of pmtGFP was replaced
