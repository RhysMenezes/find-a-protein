Hydrogen peroxide was visualized with 3,3'-diamino benzidine-HCl [ 45 ]. T3 transformants of  edr2-6  containing the pCH2 construct encoding the  EDR:HA:GFP  driven by the  EDR2  promoter were germinated on nutrient agar plants containing Musashige and Skoog salts 4.3 g per L, pH 5.7,1.5% agar, and hygromycin (30 Î¼g per mL) (Sigma, St. Louis, MO). At 1 week after germination, plants expressing GFP were observed under a Leica DMIRE2 spinning disk confocal laser scanning microscope (Leica Microsystems, Inc.). The seedlings were mounted in water and excited with an Argon laser (488 nm) for eGFP visualization. Rosette leaves from 7-week-old plants were also observed.

The plasmid pSK001H, which contained the gene for eGFP, was derived from pEZR(H)-NL by removing a  Sac I fragment containing the CaMV 35S promoter. Plasmid pZEZR(H)-NL was provided by Dave Ehrhardt (Carnegie Institution, Stanford, CA) [ 54 ]. The plasmid pCH2 was introduced into  edr2-6
