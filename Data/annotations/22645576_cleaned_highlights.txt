MATERIALS AND METHODS:
resultant plasmids were fully sequenced and used for the LR recombination reaction with the destination vector pMDC32 (Invitrogen; Curtis and Grossniklaus,  2003 ), which contains the Cauliflower mosaic virus  35S  gene promoter. To generate constructs expressing SFD1–GFP and SFD1Δ43–GFP in  Arabidopsis , the pET28c− SFD1-WT and pET28c− SFD1Δ43 plasmids were used as templates in PCR reactions with the primer pairs SFD1-Fstart plus SFD1-RCt, and SFD1Δ43-F2 plus SFD1Δ43-R2Ct, respectively. The amplified products were cloned into the pCR ® 8/GW/TOPO ®  vector. The resultant plasmids were used in the LR recombination reaction with destination vector pMDC83, such that the GFP coding sequence in pMDC83 was fused in frame to the C-terminal amino acid of the SFD1 protein (Curtis and Grossniklaus,  2003 ). The pMDC32 empty vector and pMDC83 empty vectors were obtained through LR reaction of pCR ®
confirmed by PCR. GV3101 transformants containing pMDC32 or pMDC83 with inserts of interest were used to transform  sfd1-1  mutant plants by the floral dip method (Clough and Bent,  1998 ). Hygromycin resistant seeds were selected on MS agar plates supplemented with hygromycin (20 μg ml −1 ). Expression of the transgene was confirmed by RT-PCR analysis. Plants
the attR1-F plus the SFD1-RCt primers was performed with the following conditions: 95°C for 5 min followed by 35 cycles of 95°C for 30 s, 55°C for 45 s, 72°C for 1 min, with final extension at 72°C for 10 min. Subcellular localization of SFD1–GFP protein Leaves were cut from the 4-week-old transgenic plants and used for enzymatic protoplasts isolation. Protoplasts were prepared by incubating leaves at room temperature for 2 h in a solution containing 1% cellulase, 0.3% macerozyme, 0.4 M mannitol, 20 mM KCl, and
Yokogawa Confocal Scanner Unit CSU10. Excitation wavelengths/emission filters were 488 nm/band-pass 505–535 nm for GFP and 488 nm/band-pass 672–712 nm for chloroplast autofluorescence. The entire system was controlled with Simple PCI software from Hamamatsu Corporation. Recombinant protein purification and enzyme assays A recombinant SFD1-WT, SDF1Δ43, and mis-sense mutant fusion proteins (SFD1–Ala194, SFD1–Ala297, and SFD1–Ala332) containing a
), 1 mM IPTG, 1 mM MgSO 4 , 100 μM CaCl 2  with or without 0.1% glycerol. Bacteria were grown at 37°C for 2 days and the absorbance at  A 600  was determined. Lipid extraction and ESI-MS/MS analysis Lipids were
at the Kansas Lipidomics Research Center website 10  and analyzed by MS as previously described (Xiao et al.,  2010 ). Unfractionated lipid extracts were introduced by continuous infusion into the ESI source on a triple quadrupole MS/MS (API 4000, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) at 30 μl/min. MGDG was detected as [M + NH 4 ] +  in positive ion mode with Neutral Loss of 179.1. The lipids in each class were quantified in comparison to 2.01 nmol
