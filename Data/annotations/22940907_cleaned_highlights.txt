ABSTRACT:
is unknown. The  Arabidopsis thaliana  heterotrimeric Gα protein self-activates without accessory proteins, and is kept in its resting state by the negative regulator, AtRGS1 (Regulator of G protein Signaling 1), which is the prototype of a seven transmembrane receptor fused with an RGS domain. Endocytosis of AtRGS1 by ligand-dependent endocytosis physically uncouples the GTPase accelerating activity of AtRGS1 from the Gα protein, permitting sustained activation. Phosphorylation of AtRGS1 by AtWNK8 kinase causes AtRGS1 endocytosis, required both for
RESULTS:
pair) and showed that this plasma membrane 7TM protein does not internalize with glucose. These results show that the effect of D-glucose on AtRGS1 internalization is specific, as well as time- and dose-dependent. A critical observation was that while AtRGS1-YFP internalized by glucose, the cognate Gα,
C-terminal truncation mutant (AtRGS1-ΔCtSA) and a full-length AtRGS1-3SA mutant (S428A/S435A/S436A) in which three phosphorylation sites identified were mutated to alanine residues ( Fig. 4B ), and assayed for D-glucose dependent endocytosis. While the wild-type AtRGS1-YFP was localized to the plasma membrane and endocytosed upon D-glucose treatment, the AtRGS1-3SA mutant ( Fig. 4H and 4I ) or AtRGS1-ΔCtSA ( Fig. 4J ) remained at the plasma membrane with D-glucose in both stable and transient expression
MATERIALS AND METHODS:
described previously  16  except with the following modifications. pENTR clones of the genes of interest were subcloned into one or more of the BiFC vectors pBatTL-sYFP-N or pBatTL-sYFP-C (for C-terminal tagged nYFP and cYFP halves, respectively) and pCL112_JO or pCL113_JO (for N-terminal tagged nYFP and cYFP halves, respectively). An internal positive transformation control (mitochondrial RFP marker; Mt-rk obtained from Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center (CD3-991)) was included to address the issue of transgene silencing (p19 gene silencing suppressor, mt-rk and two BiFC halves). Plasmids, Recombinant Proteins, and Antibodies cDNA for  AtWNK1  was obtained from Dr. Norihito Nakamichi, and cDNAs for  AtWNK8  and  AtWNK10  were obtained from the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center.  AtWNK  coding sequences were subcloned into pDEST15 (N-terminal GST), pCL113_JO (N-terminal split-cYFP), pACTGW-attR and pB7WGC2 (N-terminal CFP).  Ara7 ,  Rha1 ,  RabA5d ,  VTI11  and  SYP23  were obtained from the ABRC and subcloned into pEarleyGate101 (C-terminal YFP-HA), pEarleyGate102 (C-terminal CFP), and pEarleyGate104 (N-terminal YFP) plasmids.  AtRGS1  (encoding 1–459 aa) and its C-terminal truncated mutant (encoding 1–416 aa, designated as AtRGS1-ΔCt) were subcloned to pEarleyGate205 (C-terminal TAP), pEarleyGate101 and pBAT-TL-B-sYFP-N (C-terminal split-nYFP). Coding sequences for cytoplasmic region of AtRGS1 were synthesized by Celtek Bioscience (Nashville, TN, USA) with codons optimized for expression in  E. coli . AtRGS1-coding sequences RGSbox+Cterm (284–459 aa), RGSbox (284–416 aa) and Cterm (400–459 aa) of AtRGS1
Recombinant GST- or His-tagged proteins were expressed in  E. coli  (ArcticExpress RP, Agilent Technologies) with 0.5 mM IPTG at 12°C, solubilized in buffer A (50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mM NaCl, 5 mM 2-Mercaptoethanol, 1 mM PMSF and 1 µg/ml leupeptin) with 0.25 mg/ml lysozyme and 0.2 % NP-40, purified from the soluble fraction using glutathione-Sepharose
in crude extracts to reduce nonspecific binding. The purified proteins were dialyzed in buffer B (20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT and 1 mM PMSF). The AtGPA1 and AGB1 antibodies were described previously  10 ,  53 . The AtRGS1 and phosphor-specific AtRGS1 antisera were raised with the His-tagged RGS1box+Cterm protein or the phosphorylated AtRGS1 peptide (424–440 aa): CKEGY-pS-FSSPRL-pS-pS-VQGS (pS; phosphorylated-serine) (YenZym Antibodies).
stacks) of hypocotyl epidermal cells of dark grown seedlings located approximately. 3–4 mm from the cotyledon were imaged using a Zeiss LSM710 confocal laser scanning microscope equipped with a Plan-NeoFluor 20×/0.5 objective and a C-Apochromat 40×/1.20 water immersion objective. YFP, CFP and RFP were excited by a 514nm and 458nm Argon laser and a 560nm diode laser, respectively, and their respective
images of tobacco transients and Arabidopsis seedlings were captured by using an Olympus IX81 inverted microscope (Olympus America, Merville, NY) with a Hamamatsu CCD C4742-80-12AG (Hamamatsu Photonics, Bridgewater, NJ) and analyzed using Slidebook 5.0 (3i). Filter sets used were YFP (excitation, 500/20 nm; emission, 535/30 nm; same filter for GFP-tag), CFP (excitation, 436/20 nm; emission, 480/40 nm). FRET measurements in CFP/YFP double labeled cells
of GST-AtWNK kinases were mixed with 10 µl of glutathione-Sepharose 4B (GE Healthcare) in 250 µl of buffer C (50 mM MES (pH 6.0), 10 mM MgCl 2 , 5 mM MnCl 2 , 2 mM DTT, 1 mM PMSF and 1 µg/ml leupeptin). The tubes were rotated for 60 min at 4°C, and the resin was washed with buffer C with 0.1% NP-40 four times. The co-precipitated or input proteins were visualized by immunoblot analysis with anti-AtRGS1 antisera and Coomassie Brilliant Blue (CBB) staining. To test binding with AtGPA1, the same procedure was followed except that 50 µM GDP with or without aluminum tetrafloride (30 µM AlCl 3 , 10 mM MgCl 2  and 5 mM NaF) was

Approximately 50 sterilized and stratified seeds were grown in ½ X MS liquid media with 1% sucrose at 23°C, at 100 rpm
then lysed with buffer D (150 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 300 mM NaCl, 20% glycerol, 5 mM DTT, 2 mM Na 3 VO 4 , 10 mM NaF, 20 mM β-glycerophosphate, 1 mM PMSF, 2 µg/ml leupeptin and 1% ASB-14). After 2 h incubation at 4°C, the lysates were centrifuged and the supernatants were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis. The phosphorylated AtRGS1 was detected with anti-phospho-RGS1 antibody. Total AtRGS1-TAP amount was determined
AtRGS1-TAP, AtRGS1-ΔCtSA-TAP or AtGPA1, total extracts were separated with 12.5% Anderson’s gel  55  and subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analyses using PAP or anti-AtGPA1 antisera. Quantitative Real Time PCR Approximately 150 seeds were grown in ½ X MS liquid media with 1% glucose at 23°C with low light (50µE). After 7 days culture, seedlings were starved with ½ XMS media for 2 days
