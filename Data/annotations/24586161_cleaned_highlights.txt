ABSTRACT:
to activate effector-triggered immunity (ETI) in  Arabidopsis thaliana  Pi-0 plants; however, the nature of its enzymatic activity and host target(s) has remained elusive. Here we report that AvrBsT possesses acetyltransferase activity and acetylates ACIP1 (for  ACETYLATED INTERACTING PROTEIN1 ), an unknown protein from  Arabidopsis . Genetic studies revealed that  Arabidopsis  ACIP family members are required for both pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP)-triggered immunity and AvrBsT-triggered ETI during  Pseudomonas syringae  pathovar  tomato
RESULTS:
cell cortex. A portion of these punctae was aligned, forming transverse cable-like structures ( Figure 6A ). ACIP1's subcellular localization pattern partially resembled that of cytoskeletal structures. Unlike TaSRG, the ACIP-L4 ortholog, GFP-ACIP1 was not observed in the plant nucleus, indicating that ACIP1 localization is distinct from this predicted transcription factor  [28] . 10.1371/journal.ppat.1003952.g006 Figure 6 GFP-ACIP1 co-localizes with microtubules. (A) Single plane images of periclinal surface of epidermal cells of 4-day old etiolated Pi-0  P ACIP1 :: GFP-ACIP1/P 35S ::mCHERRY-TUA5  hypocotyl cells. Arrowheads show GFP-ACIP1 punctae that are not associated with microtubules. (B) Localization of GFP-ACIP1 in 4-day old etiolated Pi-0  P ACIP1 :: GFP-ACIP1  hypocotyls treated with MeOH or MeOH +10 µM oryzalin (top panels), or DMSO or DMSO +1 µM latrunculin B (bottom panels). Cells were imaged using confocal microscopy. Bars = 10 µm. Next, we applied drugs to disrupt the cytoskeleton to determine if ACIP1 co-localizes with actin and/or microtubules. Treatment of the Pi-0  P ACIP1 ::GFP-ACIP1  seedlings with oryzalin, a microtubule depolymerizing agent, disrupted the GFP-ACIP1 cable-like structures and caused the formation of numerous GFP-ACIP1 punctae throughout
contrast, the actin depolymerizing agent latrunculin B did not appear to significantly disrupt these cables ( Figure 6B ). To show ACIP co-localization with microtubules, we transformed the Pi-0  P ACIP1 ::GFP-ACIP1  lines with  P 35S ::mCHERRY-TUA5 , a fluorescently tagged isoform of α-tubulin. A large portion of the GFP-ACIP1 punctae co-localized with mCHERRY-TUA5 microtubules ( Figure 6A ). Some of the cortical GFP-ACIP1 punctae were not associated with microtubules. Inspection of the literature revealed that ACIP1 was identified in the  Arabidopsis  proteome that co-purified with tubulin by affinity chromatography 
MATERIALS AND METHODS:
and 1 mM DTT for 30 min at RT. Urea sample buffer was added to stop the reactions. Proteins assayed included: GST, GST-AvrBsT, GST-AvrBsT(C222A), GST-AvrBsT(H154A), GST-AvrBsT(K282R), GST-HopZ1a, and GST-ACIP1. Proteins were separated in a 10% SDS-PAGE gel, stained with Coomassie blue, transferred to blotting paper, dried, treated with EN3HANCE (Perkin Elmer), and then exposed to film for 2–3 weeks at 80°C.   ACIP  silencing construct and transgenic  Arabidopsis  plants A 365 bp region of 
values were determined against the average value of buffer or bacterially infected sample using the comparative Ct method (2 −ΔΔCt ). Microscopy To monitor ACIP1 protein expression and localization, the promoter region (1.5-kb upstream of start) was fused with GFP-ACIP1 in the backbone of pMDC43 to create pMDC43( P ACIP1 ::GFP-ACIP1 ). The resulting plasmid was transformed into  A. thaliana  Pi-0 plants. Transgenic  P ACIP1 ::GFP-ACIP1  lines were then transformed with P 35S ::mCHERRY-HA-TUA5. This plasmid was construct by modifying pEarleygate 104  [59] .  YFP  was substituted with  mCHERRY  and  Arabidopsis TUA5  genomic coding region was inserted after  mCHERRY . Localization of GFP-ACIP1 and mCHERRY-TUA5 in 5-day old dark grown hypocotyls was determined using a Leica TCS SP5 confocal microscope (Leica Microsystems) with Leica LAS AF software and a Leica spinning disc confocal microscope with the Yokogawa CSUX-M1 confocal scanner. Seedlings were treated with 10 µM oryzalin in MeOH for 8 hr at RT or 1 µM latrunculin B in DMSO for 4 hr at RT and then imaged. For infection, Pi-0  P ACIP1 ::GFP-ACIP1  leaves were inoculated with 1 mM MgCl 2  or bacterial strains (3×10 8  cells/mL in 1 mM MgCl 2 ) for 6 h. For exogenous PA treatment, Pi-0  P ACIP1 ::GFP-ACIP1  leaves were inoculated with 50 µM PA in 0.2% DMSO or 0.2% DMSO. Images were analyzed using ImageJ  [60] .
