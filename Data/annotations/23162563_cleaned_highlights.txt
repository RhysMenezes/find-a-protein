ABSTRACT:
pore, indicating that the function of KCO3 under osmotic stress does not depend on its direct ability to transport ions. Constitutively overexpressed AtKCO3 or AtKCO3::GFP are efficiently sorted to the tonoplast indicating that the protein is approved by the endoplasmic reticulum quality control. However, vacuoles isolated from transgenic plants do not have significant alterations in current density. Consistently, both AtKCO3 and AtKCO3::GFP are detected as homodimers upon velocity gradient centrifugation, an assembly state that would not allow for activity. We conclude that if AtKCO3
RESULTS:
KCO3 leaf homogenates, loaded onto a continuous sucrose gradient and subjected to isopycnic ultracentrifugation ( Figure  5 ). The distributions of KCO3::GFP, KCO3, and the tonoplast aquaporin γTIP were similar and they markedly differed from those of the plasma membrane aquaporin PIP2 or the endoplasmic reticulum marker endoplasmin/GRP94. γTIP monomers have a calculated molecular mass around 20 kDa, but a relevant proportion of the protein is detected as oligomers, most probably corresponding to dimers; incomplete denaturation, resulting in the detection of dimers and tetramers upon
were pelleted and further separated by centrifugation on isopycnic sucrose gradient. Proteins in each fraction (1/10 of fraction volume) were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and western blot with antibodies against KCO3 (to detect KCO3::GFP or KCO3), γTIP (tonoplast marker), PIP2 (plasma membrane marker) or endoplasmin (GRP94, endoplasmic reticulum marker), as indicated at the right of each panel. Top of each gradient is at left; numbers on top or bottom of the figure indicate
of WT or KCO3 vacuoles analyzed is given in brackets. In summary, these data strongly suggest that KCO3, present in the vacuolar membrane of overexpressing plants, does not constitute a functional ion channel in our experimental conditions. KCO3 AND KCO3::GFP ARE DETECTED AS DIMERS The formation of a tetrameric complex is a prerequisite for ion channel activity in the case of the one-P subunit KCO3. We therefore investigated on the oligomerization state of KCO3 and KCO3::GFP. Total leaf homogenate from KCO3::GFP plants was
MATERIALS AND METHODS:
6, 0.022 mM EDTA, 0.8 M NaCl, 1%  N -Lauroylsarcosine). Confirmation of the T-DNA insertion in  kco3-1  was done using the following primers: 5′GCGTGGACCGCTTGCTGCAACT3′ (T-DNA-LB), 5′CACGA-TTTCTATGCCAATGACTCCATCGG3′ (KCO3-fwd), 5′AAAAA-GAGCTCTTAAACTGGTTCAACTATATCC3′ (KCO3-rev). For phenotypic analysis, seeds were plated on MS media supplemented with 3% sucrose in axenic condition. One-week-old seedlings were transferred to media containing the appropriate solute for the growth test in different abiotic stress conditions and were vertically grown
seedlings were moved to liquid MS media with 10 mM H 2 O 2 . For mock treatment, plants were transferred to liquid MS media. Plants were grown on a shaker for 5 days, with daily change of media. GENERATION OF TRANSGENIC PLANTS Plasmid DNA required for sequencing purposes was prepared using Qiagen columns (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Sequence determinations were performed by MWG-Biotech
was done for three clones as described above. Plasmid p35S- KCO3  was generated by inserting the At KCO3  cDNA (KpnI/blunt/EcoRV pCRII- KCO3 ) into SmaI site of pBinAR-Kan ( Höfgen and Willmitzer, 1988 ). A C-terminal  GFP -fusion construct was created using pBI-35S-10H-GFP-JFH1 ( Hong et al., 1999 ). The  At KCO3 cDNA was amplified using the primers 5′CGC GTCGAC ATGCCAATGACTCCATC-GG3′ (KCO3-FSI.seq) and 5′ATC ACTAGT ACAGAAGTTGCGG-TGGTTAAATCCAA3′ (KCO3-FSII.rev) and fused to  GFP  coding sequence via  Sal I/ Xho I /Spe I sites to generate p35S- KCO3::GFP . Transgenic  Arabidopsis  plants expressing KCO3 or KCO3::GFP were generated by vacuum infiltration with  Agrobacterium tumefaciens  strain GV3101 transformed with the constructs p35S- KCO3  or 35S- KCO3::GFP . Kanamycin-resistant plants (T0) were identified. Experiments were conducted using T3 or T4 plants. ANTIBODIES The following antibodies were used in this study: rabbit polyclonal anti-GFP (1:1000 dilution, Invitrogen), rabbit polyclonal anti-endoplasmin/GRP94 (1:1,000 dilution;  Klein et al., 2006 ), rabbit polyclonal anti-PiP2 (1:10,000 dilution;  Santoni et al., 2003 ), or chicken polyclonal anti-γTIP raised against a synthetic peptide corresponding to the C-terminal nine

TOTAL PROTEIN ANALYSIS Arabidopsis  wild-type or transgenic plants were grown in sterile conditions on half-concentrated MS media (Duchefa Biochemie) supplemented with 10 g/l sucrose and 0.8% (w/v) phyto agar (Duchefa Biochemie) at 23°C under a 16/8 h light/dark cycle. 3–6 weeks

Molecular weight markers (Fermentas) were used as molecular mass markers. SUBCELLULAR FRACTIONATION Total microsomes were prepared as follows: leaf tissues were homogenized in a medium containing 50 mM Tris-acetate (pH 7.5), 250 mM sorbitol, 2 mM EGTA, 2 mM MgCl 2 , 2 mM DTT supplemented with Complete.
