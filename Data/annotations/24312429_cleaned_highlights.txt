MATERIALS AND METHODS:
genomic DNA using Pfu DNA polymerase (Promega Corp., Madison, WI, USA) and the oligonucleotides prom20820FOR ( 5’-GGGGACAAGTTTGTACAAAAAAGCAGGCTTAAC CCTTGTGTCAGAGTTATAATCC-3’ ) and prom20820REV ( 5’-GGGGACCACTTTGTACAAGAAAGCTGGGTTGTCGAAGAGAGAAAGG AGAATG -3’ ) containing the Gateway-compatible AttB recombination sites. The ORF for the overexpression and N-terminal GFP fusion line was isolated using the BAC clone T1M15 ordered from ABRC (Arabidopsis Biological Resource Centre) and the oligonucleotides Fattb1at5g20820 ( 5’-GGGGACAAGTTTGTACAAAAAAGCAGGCTT CATGGCGAAAGGAGGAAAC-3’ ) and Rattbat5g20820-N ( 5’- GGGGACCACTTTGTACAAG AAAGCTGGGTTTTAACAAGCGTAGAACTCG-3’ ) containing the AttB recombination sites. For the C-terminal GFP-fusion construct, the reverse primer was constructed to exclude the stop-codon Rattbat5g20820-C ( 5’-GGGGACCACTTTGTACAAGAAAGCTGG GTTTCAAGCGTAGAACTCG-3’ ). The amplified promoter and open reading frames were first recombined with pDONR207 (Invitrogen) and the resulting clones were checked by colony PCR and subsequently
the VIB (Flemish Institute of Biotechnology). Clones found to have a 100% correct sequence were subsequently recombined with the destination vectors. For promoter::GUS or GFP constructs pGWB3 and pGWB4 [ 45 ] were used respectively, for CaMV 35S-driven overexpression pGWB2, for N and C-terminal GFP fusion pGWB5 and pGWB6 respectively [ 45 ] was used. The resulting clones were subsequently checked by colony PCR and then used to electroporate Agrobacterium tumefaciens C58Rif harbouring pMP90 [ 46 ]. Plant transformation of wild type (Col-0) was
At5g20820 Heterozygous seeds of the line N307666 were obtained from NASC and sown on soil. Genomic DNA was extracted according to a modified protocol of [ 49 ]. Homozygous, heterozygous and wild type plants were identified using genomic primers GABI_591E03.FP( 5’-CCGAATCGGTAATGGCGAAAGGAGG-3’ ) and GABI_591E03.RP ( 5’- GCGTAGAACTCG ACAAGTTCGTAGACCG -3’ ) flanking the T-DNA insertion site and T-DNA specific primers T-DNA.GK/N30766 ( 5’-ATATTGACCAT CATACTC ATTGC-3’ ). The level of the At5g20820 transcript was semi-quantitatively determined by preparing cDNA using the
PCRs were performed with ACT8 (id. At02270958_gH) as endogenous control and TaqMan probe (id At02302302_s1) corresponding to At5g20820. For all reactions at least 3 biological repetitions were performed.  Western Blot Analysis Western blot analysis was performed on the protein-GFP fusion lines to detect the size of the GFP-containing proteins. Protein isolation was performed as described in [ 50 ] and isolated proteins were separated on a pre-casted NuPage 4-12% Bis Tris Mini gel with MOPS buffer (Life technologies). Proteins were then blotted to a nitrocellulose blotting membrane. Non-specific antibody binding sites were blocked with 5 % BSA in TBS-T before the rabbit anti-GFP primary antibody was added at a concentration of 0.1-10 μg/mL. After
