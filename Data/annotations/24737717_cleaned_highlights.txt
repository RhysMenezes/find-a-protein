ABSTRACT:
abiotic changes in their environment. Root hair expansion is a polarized process requiring secretory and endosomal pathways that deliver and recycle plasma membrane and cell wall material to the growing root hair tip. In this paper, the role of VTI13 (AT3G29100), a member of the VTI vesicular soluble NSF attachment receptor (SNARE) gene family in  Arabidopsis thaliana , in root hair

VTI13 localizes to the vacuole membrane in root hair cells To identify the intracellular compartments within which VTI13 functions, we characterized GFP–VTI13 subcellular localization in root epidermal cells and root hair cells using confocal scanning laser microscopy (CSLM). While both constructs complemented  vti13 , the 35S:GFP–VTI13-expressing lines yielded higher-contrast images and were used for all subsequent CSLM experiments except when stated otherwise. GFP–VTI13 was observed in two distinct subcellular locations: the membrane of a large internal compartment and smaller compartments that were punctate and mobile (Fig.  3 ). We also observed GFP–VTI13 fluorescence in vacuolar ‘bulb’-like structures (Fig.  3 A, B), which have been characterized previously with respect to the localization of family member VTI11 within vacuolar membranes ( Saito, 2003 ;  Saito  et al ., 2011 ). VTI13 localized to these structures in both epidermal cells at the root tip and in root hairs (Fig.  3 A, B).  Fig. 3. Localization of 35S:GFP–VTI13 in
to confirm that VTI13 localized to the vacuolar membrane in root hairs and determine if the VTI13 punctate structures represented a class of endosomes. To confirm that the large, VTI13-labelled internal membrane corresponded to the vacuole, transgenic lines expressing 35S:GFP–VTI13 in a wild-type background were crossed with a transgenic line expressing a resident vacuolar membrane protein, YFP-γTIP ( Nelson  et al ., 2007 ). GFP–VTI13 was found to co-localize with the vacuolar marker YFP-γTIP at the vacuole membrane only and not in the small, mobile GFP–VTI13 compartments in growing root hairs (Fig.  3 E). These results support a role for VTI13 in the transport or docking of vesicles at the vacuole membrane during root hair growth. To investigate the nature of the small, punctate VTI13-labelled internal structures, we treated GFP–VTI13 expressing seedlings with the lipophilic dye FM4-64, which is used to label the plasma membrane and internal membranes involved in endosomal trafficking ( Fischer-Parton  et al ., 2000 ). When these seedlings were labelled with FM4-64 for 2–3 min, no co-labelling between FM4-64 and GFP–VTI13 was observed in root hairs (Fig.  3 B), indicating that GFP–VTI13 did not localize within the plasma membrane. However, after longer treatments of 15–20 min with FM4-64, we did observe co-localization in some of the GFP–VTI13 mobile fraction within small puncta near the root hair tip (Fig.  3 D), suggesting that this might represent a population of
pattern of localization for GFP–VTI13 was observed in both root tip epidermal cells and root hairs (Fig.  3 A, B), indicating that VTI13 localization is similar in these two cell types and that VTI13 is a component of intracellular membranes. VTI13 mobility requires the
vesicular trafficking are dependent on the structure of the actin cytoskeleton but not on microtubule organization ( Baluška  et al ., 2002 ;  Grebe  et al ., 2003 ). To investigate whether the mobility of the GFP–VTI13-labelled compartments required an intact actin cytoskeleton, we treated 5-day-old seedlings with 100 n m  Latrunculin B, an actin-depolymerizing agent, for 30 min. Root hairs were then examined for the mobility of GFP–VTI13-labelled compartments using CSLM. When seedlings were treated with vehicle alone there was dynamic movement of both the GFP–VTI13-labelled vacuole membrane and the punctate compartments, which moved over long distances along the shaft of the root hair (Fig.  4 A,  Supplementary Data Video S1 ). Seedlings treated with 10 μ m  oryzalin, a molecule that depolymerizes microtubules, had no effect on the movement of the VTI13-labelled vacuolar membrane or mobile compartments in root hairs when compared with DMSO-treated seedlings (Fig.  4 B,  Supplementary Data Video S2 ). In contrast, treatment of root hairs with Latrunculin B resulted in the loss of long-distance movement of
root hair growth.  Fig. 4. VTI13-labelled compartment mobility requires the actin cytoskeleton. The distribution of VTI13-labelled compartments in the  vti13 -complemented lines was diffuse throughout the root hairs of 5-day-old seedlings treated with (A) 100 n m  DMSO or (B) 10 μ m  oryzalin, and became aggregated after

While the ARF–GEF GNOM-LIKE1 (GNL1) that is associated with the Golgi apparatus is considered BFA-resistant in arabidopsis roots, concentrations of BFA greater than 50 μ m  induce a morphological aggregation of TGN containing SYP61–GFP in arabidopsis root protoplasts ( Langhans  et al ., 2011 ). Although the exact

When root hairs of  vti13 -complemented lines expressing 35S:GFP–VTI13 were labelled with an anti-GFP antibody, gold particles were seen at the vacuole membrane, the Golgi apparatus and the periphery of the Golgi stacks (Fig.  6 ). These data, together with our previous analysis of GFP–VTI13 localization, support a localization of VTI13 within the Golgi and a population of early endosomes or the TGN in arabidopsis root hair cells.

MATERIALS AND METHODS:
MATERIALS AND METHODS Plant materials and growth conditions Arabidopsis thaliana  (Columbia-0) was used for all experiments involving wild-type and mutant analysis. Our standard plant growth media for seedlings consisted of 1× Murashige and Skoog (MS) salts, 1 % (w/v) sucrose,
standard protocol (Invitrogen). For RT-PCR the VTI13 forward and reverse primers described in  Supplementary Data Table S1  were used with the first-strand cDNA templates to amplify gene products using Phusion Taq polymerase (New England Biolabs). Generation of GFP–VTI13 constructs 35S:GFP–VTI13 construct A 35S:GFP–VTI13 construct was kindly provided by Dr Masa Sato ( Uemura  et al ., 2004 ) and was subcloned into the pENTR/D-TOPO vector (Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY) to use in Gateway cloning. pENTR/35S:GFP–VTI13 (pERL02A) was cloned into the Gateway destination vector pEarleyGate CDS694 ( Earley  et al ., 2006 ), using the LR Clonase II reaction kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's directions. Clones containing 35S:GFP–VTI13 in the CDS694 vector were transformed into  Agrobacterium tumefaciens  strain GV3101, after which the 35S:GFP–VTI13 construct (pERL02) was transformed into arabidopsis using the floral dip method ( Bechtold and Pelletier, 1998 ;  Zhang  et al ., 2006 ). VTI13:GFP–VTI13 construct A 2-kb DNA fragment just upstream of the  VTI13  translational start codon and including the 5′-UTR was amplified from genomic DNA using primers that added BamHI and NcoI restriction enzyme sites at the 5′ ends (VTI13pro_F
pERL03A. This construct and pERL02 were digested with both BamHI and NcoI and then gel purified to extract the 2-kb VTI13 promoter fragment from pERL03A and the promoterless pERL02 linear plasmid. The VTI13 promoter was inserted upstream of the GFP–VTI13 construct using standard molecular techniques. The  VTI13 :GFP–VTI13 construct (pERL03) was first transformed into  Escherichia coli  strain DH5α and then into  A. tumefaciens  strain GV3101 for the transformation of arabidopsis. Characterizing  vti13  root hair phenotypes Seeds were sterilized and plated on 1× MS medium, pH 6, 1× MS medium, pH 5, or 1× MS medium, pH 6, with the addition of 200 m m  mannitol, and grown as described
Center (ABRC) stock centre. Primers used for genotyping this mutant are listed in  Supplementary Data Table S1  and spanned all of the introns within  VTI13 . The  vti13  mutant was transformed with both the 35S:GFP–VTI13 and  VTI13 :GFP–VTI13 constructs. Homozygous transgenic lines expressing each  VTI13  construct were identified through glufosinate (BASTA) resistance in the  T 3  generation and then analysed for complementation of the  vti13  short, branched root hair phenotype in 5-day-old seedlings germinated on 1× MS solid medium. Root hairs were imaged using bright-field microscopy. Producing the  prp3 vti13  double mutant The  vti13  homozygous null mutant was crossed to a  prp3  homozygous null mutant and  F 1 
vti13  double mutants from two independent crosses were characterized for their patterns of root hair growth in these studies. Latrunculin B and oryzalin treatments of arabidopsis seedlings Arabidopsis seedlings were grown for 5 days on plates containing 1× MS
100 n m  Latrunculin B or 10 μ m  oryzalin diluted in 1× MS medium, pH 6. Seedlings were incubated for 2 h at room temperature before confocal imaging of root hairs or root epidermal cells expressing 35S:GFP–VTI13. Seedlings were suspended in the treatment medium during imaging. Brefeldin A treatment of arabidopsis seedlings Seedlings were grown for 5 days on 1× MS plates and then incubated with 10 or 50 μ m  brefeldin A (BFA) diluted in 1× MS medium directly on microscope slides. Seedlings treated with BFA were incubated at room temperature for 10 min before confocal imaging of GFP–VTI13. During imaging, seedlings were mounted in the treatment solutions. Where indicated, the lipophilic dye FM4-64 was added to the BFA treatment solutions at a concentration of 5 μ m . Construction of transgenic lines expressing both yellow fluorescent protein–γ- tonoplast intrinsic protein and GFP–VTI13 To produce plants that co-expressed GFP–VTI13 and yellow fluorescent protein–γ-tonoplast intrinsic protein (YFP-γTIP), a transgenic line expressing 35S:GFP–VTI13 in a wild-type background was crossed with the 35S:YFP-γTIP transgenic line ( Nelson  et al ., 2007 ), and heterozygous  F 1  seedlings were analysed by confocal microscopy. Confocal microscopy of GFP–VTI13 transgenic seedlings All fluorescent lines were imaged with a Zeiss confocal LSM 510 META laser scanning microscope using a 63× oil immersion objective. The GFP–VTI13 fusion lines were excited with an argon ion laser line main beam splitter of 488 nm and emissions were captured using a 505/530 nm bypass filter. When FM4-64 staining was imaged with the GFP–VTI13 lines, the samples were excited at 488 nm with the argon ion laser with a main beam splitter of 488 nm and an additional splitter of 545 nm. The 505/530 nm bypass filter was used to capture GFP emission
software was used to acquire images and movies of root hair and epidermal cells. Images were then processed using ImageJ. Seedling fixation for transmission electron microscopy Roots were fixed in 1 % glutaraldehyde in Sorensen's buffer (EMS, Fort Washington, PA, USA) on ice for 45 min. The roots were subsequently washed three times with cold Sorensen's buffer and separated into two sets. One set was gently post-fixed in 0·8 % osmium tetroxide for 90 min on
for 16 h. Sections (60 nm) of roots were obtained using a Reichert Ultracut ultramicrotome and diamond knife. Sections were collected on Formvar-coated nickel slot grids. Immunogold labelling was performed as follows, using monoclonal antibodies against GFP (Invitrogen) or SYP41 (a generous gift from Natasha Raikhel). Grids containing osmicated specimens were treated for 5 min with 5 % H 2 O 2  and then washed with distilled water. All grids were treated with 0·2 %
solution consisting of 1 % bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7·2) containing 0·1 % Tween-20 (PBST) for 30 min. Grids were washed and placed on droplets of a solution containing a 1/50 dilution of antibodies (SYP41 or GFP) in PBST for 90 min at 37 °C. After this time, the grids were washed and blocked again as described above. The grids were then incubated in a 1/150 dilution of anti-rabbit antibody in PBST for 90 min at
