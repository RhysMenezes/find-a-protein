RESULTS:
Results BRI1 and SERK3 are present in plasma membrane nanoclusters To investigate the distribution of BRI1-GFP and SERK3/BAK1-mCherry at the PM we imaged these receptors using VAEM. Both receptors form hetero-oligomeric complexes required for signal transduction and are part of the same signalling pathway [ 2 ,  8 ]. VAEM showed that neither BRI1
due to curvature of the root, which causes the epidermal cell layer to be outside the critical range for VAEM. Our VAEM setup was capable of visualizing endosomes and other internal membrane compartments demonstrated by imaging of the ARA6/Rab F1-mRFP marker [ 25 ] ( S1 Fig ). Also, the ER marker WAVE6-mCherry [ 26 ] was visualized using VAEM. In plant cells, the ER forms a net-like basket occupying the cortical space just below the plasma membrane. Time-lapse imaging revealed that the ER is a mobile and dynamic organelle ( S1 Movie ). We used additional markers of Golgi stacks (WAVE18-mRFP, [ 26 ], Trans Golgi Network (VHAa1-mRFP, [ 27 ]) and retrograde trafficking (ARA7/Rab F2b, [ 25 ,  28 ] to track intracellular membrane compartments in conjunction with the PM of  Arabidopsis  root epidermal cells ( S1 Fig ). 10.1371/journal.pone.0169905.g001 Fig 1 VAEM reveals a heterogeneous distribution of BRI1-GFP and SERK3-mCherry in the PM.

Images taken are of epidermal cells in the early elongation zone. Scale bars represent 10 μm. Endosomal vesicles on the cytoplasmic side of the PM were clearly visible for both BRI1 and SERK3/BAK1, with a higher number of BRI1-containing vesicles compared to SERK3/BAK1. Especially BRI1-GFP line 2, which has approximately 3x higher expression of BRI1-GFP compared to wild type, shows a large number of fluorescent endosomal compartments, which are reminiscent of LE/EE compartments ( S2  and  S3  Movies). Interestingly,
co-localize in the PM and that a minor amount of BRI1 and SERK3/BAK1 receptors is already present in preformed complexes [ 8 ]. To test whether the co-receptors influence the distribution of the main receptor in the PM, the BRI1-GFP line 2 was crossed into a  serk1serk3  mutant background. VAEM
barely affected compared to BRI1-GFP line 2 in wild-type roots. Roots of  serk1serk3  double mutants are almost completely insensitive to BL [ 33 ], indicating that no active signalling complexes are formed. Our results thus imply that SERK co-receptors do not participate
1 ). Two explanations are conceivable: first, either the nanoclusters harbouring PM located receptors can accommodate variable numbers or, second, a larger number of receptors is distributed more uniformly outside of the PM nanocluster domains upon overexpression. In the SERK3-GFP line about two-fold more nanoclusters were present compared to BRI1-GFP line 1, of which each contained at least two receptors. A similar calculation for the SERK3/BAK1-mCherry line resulted in about 1 ± 1 receptors per nanocluster. The number of receptors per nanocluster is in line with estimates based on

h. This treatment is routinely used to fully activate the BR signalling pathway and optimized to achieve a near maximal receptor-ligand occupancy [ 33 ]. Interestingly, under these conditions of full activation, only a minor amount of BRI1-GFP and SERK3/BAK1-mCherry was previously found to interact [ 8 ]. It was therefore of great interest to test whether changes in the distribution or number of nanoclusters would be visible upon full activation of the signalling pathway. Surprisingly, we could not detect any significant change in the number of clusters per μm 2  at the PM or cluster size for both BRI1-GFP and SERK3/BAK1-mCherry between the BRZ treated roots and the BRZ+BL treated roots ( Table 2 ). Roots expressing SERK3/BAK1-mCherry showed a non-significant increase in the number of clusters upon BRZ treatment. BRI1-GFP distribution was also not affected in the brassinosteroid synthesis mutant  det 2 ( S5 Fig ), which contains less than 10% of the normal WT levels of brassinosteroids [ 37 ]. 10.1371/journal.pone.0169905.t002 Table 2 Quantification of clusters/ μm 2  and cluster size of BRI1 and SERK3.

for BRI1 and SERK 3/BAK1 to rapid directional movement ER marker ( S1 – S6  Movies). In order to characterize the mobility of BRI1 and SERK3/BAK1 receptors in the PM, we performed fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) on fluorescently labelled receptors expressed in Arabidopsis roots. In the elongation zone of  Arabidopsis  root cells, BRI1-GFP and SERK3/BAK1-GFP showed a slow diffusion (below 0.1 μm 2 *s -1 ) and a mobile fraction of 35 and 60% for BRI1 and SERK3/BAK1, respectively. These values were at the lower end of 0.1–1.0 μm 2 *s -1 , reported
together, our VAEM and FRAP data suggest that both BRI1 and SERK3/BAK1 receptors are distributed in PM nanoclusters, which are largely immobile and contain only a limited number of BRI1 and SERK3/BAK1 receptors. 10.1371/journal.pone.0169905.g002 Fig 2 FRAP analysis of BRI1-GFP and KNOLLE-GFP in epidermal cells of  Arabidopsis  roots.

addition, BRI1 and SERK3/BAK1 nanocluster distribution was not affected upon ligand induced activation. To investigate the underlying mechanism regulating membrane distribution, we treated  Arabidopsis  roots with various inhibitors of the endocytic, cytoskeleton or biosynthetic pathways. Treatment of BRI1-GFP and SERK3/BAK1-mCherry seedlings with cycloheximide, latrunculin B or brefeldin A either alone or in combination with BRZ or with BRZ and BL did not result in any consistent change in distribution of either receptor (data not shown). Receptor interactions
interaction between BRI1-SERK3/BAK1 hetero-oligomers. We therefore performed SSO FRET-FLIM by focussing the confocal spot at the PM of root epidermal cells. As expected, fluorescence intensity images obtained with this approach ( Fig 3B ) revealed a similar distribution of BRI1-GFP nanoclusters as
the receptors inside nanoclusters or whether it is due to technical limitations, such as the precision by which the confocal volume can be positioned with respect to the plane of the PM. In root cells expressing both BRI1-GFP and SERK3-mCherry, a small number of nanoclusters showed reduced fluorescence lifetimes ( τ  = 2227 ± 134 ps,  Table 4 ). This observation indicated that a few nanoclusters located in the root epidermal cell PM contain both receptors in close proximity, leading to a detectable FRET signal ( Fig 4 ). BRZ treatment followed by application of BL showed only a minor reduction in overall fluorescence lifetimes of BRI1-GFP or BRI1-GFP/SERK3/BAK1-mCherry expressing root cells as determined by SSO FRET-FLIM ( τ  = 2241 ±103 ps,  Table 4 ). This finding is in full accordance with recently published data using conventional FRET-FLIM, showing only a small increase in interaction
BL ( Table 4 ) independent of analysis conditions (see  materials and methods ) suggesting that that no significant changes in the size or composition of nanoclusters occurred upon ligand application. 10.1371/journal.pone.0169905.g004 Fig 4 SSO-FRET-FLIM of BRI1-GFP and BRI1-GFP/SERK3/BAK1-mCherry in absence and presence of BL.

Using IPS in conventional FRET-FLIM, we previously showed that upon BL stimulation in BRZ pre-treated BRI1-GFP/SERK3/BAK1-mCherry expressing roots the IPS increased from about 8% to 13% [ 8 ]. Using the same analysis method for our SSO FRET-FLIM results, we determined an IPS of 15% in ligand-depleted roots ( Table 4 ). This percentage is
MATERIALS AND METHODS:
were surface sterilized and germinated on ½ Murashige and Skoog medium (Duchefa) supplemented with 1% sucrose (Sigma) and 1% Daishin agar (Duchefa). Plants were grown at 22°C under fluorescent light, with 16 h light/8h dark photoperiods. Col-0 plants expressing BRI1 (AT4G39400) fused to GFP under its native promoter, here referred to as BRI1-GFP line 1, were provided by N. Geldner [ 12 ]. BRI1-GFP line 2 is a BRI1-GFP line overexpressing the transgene roughly three-fold, and was provided by J. Chory [ 50 ]. Col-0 plants expressing SERK3/BAK1-mCherry or SERK3/BAK1-GFP under control of its native promoter were generated as previously described [ 8 ]. BRI1-GFP line 2 was crossed with the SERK3-mCherry line to create a plant harbouring both transgenes. S erk1 serk3  mutant plants harbouring BRI1-GFP was produced by crossing BRI1-GFP line 2 with the double mutant  serk1-3  (GABI-KAT line 448E10)  serk3-2  (SALK_116202) resulting in the  serk1serk3  BRI1-GFP line. The  det 2 seeds were obtained from the  Arabidopsis  seed stock centre and crossed with BRI1-GFP line 2. Col-0 plants containing the transgenes Wave6-mCherry and Wave18-RFP were provided by N. Geldner [ 26 ], LT16B-GFP was provided by C. ten Hove [ 22 ], VHAa1-mRFP [ 27 ], ARA7/Rab F2B-mRFP and ARA6/ Rab F1-mRFP were provided by K. Schumacher, Heidelberg. KNOLLE-GFP was used as a positive control for the FRAP experiments based on the data of [ 51 ]. The pBIR3:BIR3-GFP line was constructed by Walter van Dongen (Biochemistry, WU). Hormone and inhibitor treatments For hormone treatment, six-day-old seedlings were incubated in 1 mL ½ Murashige and Skoog medium,
were transferred to plates complemented with 5 μM brassinazole (BRZ, TCI Europe) and grown on these plates for an additional two days. For FRET-FLIM experiments, 5 day old seedlings were used. The seedlings were transferred to 1 ml ½ MS medium containing 5 μM BRZ 3 days post germination for an additional two days. BR signalling was induced by incubation of seedlings with 1 μM BL for 1 hour. Variable-angle epifluorescence microscopy (VAEM) In total-internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIRFM),
of the number of receptors per nanocluster, we defined areas of 5x5 pixels as region of interest and analysed bleaching decay curves by plotting z-axis profile function. Confocal microscopy and FRAP experiments Roots of  Arabidopsis  seedlings expressing BRI1-GFP line 1, SERK3/BAK1-GFP or KNOLLE-GFP were imaged with a Zeiss CONFOCOR2/LSM510 confocal microscope equipped with a 40x/1.2NA water objective, and an argon laser (output of 6.1 A). For FRAP analysis, the PM was scanned at 488 nm excitation with a laser power of 5% and 9% for BRI1-GFP and SERK3/BAK1-GFP respectively. The fluorescence intensity of GFP was detected with a band-pass filter at 505–550 nm. The image size was set to 512x512 pixels and four scans were averaged for each picture. After 3 scans, a high intensity bleach pulse (50 iterations at 50% laser power) at 488 nm was applied over the selected area. Subsequently, the fluorescence recovery was followed for 499 s and 436 s for BRI1-GFP and SERK3/BAK1-GFP respectively. FRAP data analysis was performed by subtracting the background signal from the raw data followed by a normalisation of the fluorescence intensity between zero and one ( Fig 2  and  S8 Fig ). The normalised data were plotted using MS Excel, which was also used for curve fitting. Selective-surface observation FRET-FLIM Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) is a process in which excitation energy is transferred from a donor fluorophore to an acceptor chromophore through nonradiative dipole–dipole coupling [ 60 ]. This process can only occur if fluorescent donor and acceptor
of the root epidermal cells. In this configuration, it was possible to observe signals from the PM whilst largely omitting signals from underlying organelles such as the cortical ER. A 40 MHz tunable supercontinuum laser was used to excite GFP and mCherry at 488 nm and 587 nm, respectively. Fluorescence emission was detected using an internal Hybrid (HyD) detector with 100 ps time resolution and collected in a spectral window of 495–550 nm for GFP and 500–540 nm for mCherry provided by an Acousto-Optical Beam Splitter. The signal output from the HyD was coupled to an external time-correlated single photon counting module (Becker&Hickl) for acquiring FLIM data. Typical images had 128 x 128 pixels
