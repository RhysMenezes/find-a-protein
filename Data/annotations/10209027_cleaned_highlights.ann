G 15 V-At-Rac2 or T 20 N-At-Rac2 were coexpressed in pollen tubes with a GFP-mouse  talin fusion protein, which we have shown to label plant  actin filaments in vivo in a specific and noninvasive manner ( Kost et al., 1998 ). The actin cytoskeleton

The  GFP-PLC-δ 1 -PH  sequence in pLAT52MCS was altered by  QuikChange™ mutagenesis to sequences encoding GFP-PLC-δ 1 -PH-K 32 L and GFP-PLC-δ 1 -PH-K 32 E. Correct amplification of the regions encoding mutated versions of PLC-δ 1 -PH was confirmed by sequencing. A. thaliana Transformation
 Axioscope microscope equipped with a 100-W mercury lamp. All images were obtained  by exposing 400 ASA 35 mm film (EliteII;  Eastman Kodak Co. ) for 10–15 s.  Confocal analysis of GFP expression was performed using an LSM410 inverted confocal microscope ( Carl Zeiss Inc. ) as outlined in  Kost et al.  (1998) .

After resuspension in buffer C during the last washing step, one-tenth of the total volume of each sample was analyzed by  SDS-PAGE and Coomassie brilliant blue staining to verify concentration  and quality of the recombinant proteins used. Washed beads were resuspended in 35 μl buffer C. Samples used to investigate effects of phosphatidic acid on At-Rac2–associated kinase activity were treated similarly,
