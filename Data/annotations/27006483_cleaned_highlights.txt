ABSTRACT:
RESULTS:
chloroplast development and pigment synthesis, we screened an EMS-mutagenized M 2  population for mutants with abnormal leaf color. This screen uncovered a pale yellow inner leaf color mutant,  rps5,  whose phenotype was controlled by a single nuclear recessive gene. In comparison with wild-type plants, this
, 2004 ). Plastid localization can be altered by single amino acid changes ( Shumskaya  et al. , 2012 ). We investigated whether the single amino acid substitution of RPS5 could affect the localization of RPS5. The  rps5-GFP  construct was
MATERIALS AND METHODS:
and Skoog plates containing 30mg l −1  carbenicillin and 50mg l −1  hygromycin ( Yuan  et al. , 2015 ). Subcellular localization Full-length cDNAs of  RPS5  and  rps5  were cloned into the pGPTVII.GFP vector ( Walter  et al. , 2004 ) and electroporated into  A. tumefaciens  strain GV3101.  Agrobacterium  cells carrying the  35S:RPS5-GFP  or  35S:rps5-GFP  construct were infiltrated into 4-week-old tobacco leaves for transient expression. After infiltration, leaves of transgenic tobacco expressing RPS5-GFP and rps5-GFP fusion proteins were analyzed by a Leica TCS SP5 laser scanning confocal microscope as described by  Zhou  et al.  (2015) . The primers used for the plasmid construction are listed in  Supplementary Table S1 .
Dynamics), in-gel digestion, and 2DGeLC sample analysis on Synapt HDMS coupled with nan-Acquity was carried out as described ( Wang  et al. , 2013 ;  Yang  et al. , 2007, 2011 ). Proteins extracted from  RPS5 -overexpressing lines were analyzed on Orbitrap Elite using a
PRS5 was determined by extracted ion chromatograms as described by  Vaidya  et al.  (2013) . The peak areas of detected precursor ions at each specific  m/z  corresponding to the targeted peptides were obtained with mass tolerance at 5ppm using Xcalibur 2.2 software. The functional classification of identified proteins was conducted based on the bincodes of MapMan ( http://mapman.gabipd.org/web/guest/mapman ). Protein subcellular localizations were predicted by TAIR10 ( https://www.arabidopsis.org/ ) and the PPDB database (
