ABSTRACT:
The endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT) guides transmembrane proteins to domains that bud away from the cytoplasm. The ESCRT machinery consists of four complexes. ESCRT complexes 0–II are important for cargo recognition and concentration via ubiquitin binding. Most of the membrane bending function is mediated by the large multimeric ESCRT-III complex and associated proteins. Here we present the first  in vivo  proteome analysis of a member of the ESCRT-III complex which is unique to the plant kingdom. We
that coimmunoprecipitated proteins from  Arabidopsis thaliana  roots expressing a functional GFP-tagged VACUOLAR PROTEIN SORTING 2.2 (AtVPS2.2) protein are members of the ESCRT-III complex and associated proteins. Therefore we propose that at least in plants the large ESCRT-III membrane scaffolding complex consists of a mixture of SNF7, VPS2 and the associated VPS46 and VPS60 proteins. Apart from transmembrane proteins, numerous membrane-associated but also nuclear and extracellular proteins have been identified, indicating that AtVPS2.2 might be involved in processes beyond the classical ESCRT role. This study is the first  in vivo  proteome analysis with a tagged ESCRT-III component demonstrating the feasibility of this approach
RESULTS:
in other proteomic analyses are indicated. MW, molecular weight; IP, immunoprecipitation; TMD, transmembrane domain; SP, signal peptide; GPI, GPI anchor; N-Myr, myristoylation site. Not surprisingly two ESCRT-III components (AtVPS2.1, AtSNF7.1) have been successfully pulled down indicating that the C-terminal GFP-tag did not affect the interaction. Yet three ESCRT-III associated proteins AtVPS46.1, AtVPS46.2
ontology annotations (Table  1 ). Also secondary structure predictions and post-translational modification motifs characteristic for subcellular localizations were used for the classification such as transmembrane domains, signal peptides and myristoylation signatures (Table  1 ). None of the AtVPS2.2-GFP interactors had signals for GPI-anchors, prenylation or palmitoylation. Only the IBA-response 3 protein contains a myristoylation motif and is annotated as peroxisomal protein. Although the classical function of the ESCRT-III complex in the biogenesis of MVBs suggests that AtVPS2.2-GFP interactors might be targeted to lytic compartments, only four proteins are annotated to vacuoles. Since these proteins are known to be membrane associated they probably locate at the tonoplast. However, 11 AtVPS2.2 interactors have also been identified in five published proteomic studies of isolated vacuoles (Figure  4 ). 55 − 57  None of these are classical luminal vacuolar proteins.

mediated membrane narrowing and lipid rearrangements at the neck (Figure  7 ). We cannot exclude that the interaction of an ESCRT-III subunit with dynamins is only restricted to the plant specific member of the VPS2 protein family. 27 AtVPS2.2-GFP Localizes in the Nucleus and Crosstalk Might Exist with Regulators of Gene Expression and RNA Maturation and Processing An unexpected high fraction of seven AtVPS2.2 interactors are annotated to the nucleus and five more have been isolated in proteome studies of isolated nuclei (Figure  5 ). 78 , 79  Although AtVPS2.2-GFP localizes primarily to vesicles of different sizes and at distinct domains of the plasma membrane (Figure  5 B–D,F, Supplemental Figure S1B,  Supporting Information ), weak GFP signals are also detected in nuclei of root meristems (Figure  5 C,D,F). We found AtVPS2.2 specific interactions with nuclear proteins such as histone H2A and five RNA binding proteins including ATP-dependent helicases (EMB1507, EIFA1), a poly (A) binding
spliceosome subunit (SUS2, abnormal suspensor 2), the nuclear transport factor 2 (NTF2) and a putative nuclear RNA-binding protein. These interactions and the localization of AtVPS2.2 raise the possibility that AtVPS2.2 might function in gene regulation as well. Figure 5 AtVPS2.2-GFP localizes to distinct region of the plasma membrane, in cytoplasmic vesicles separated for the trans-Golgi network (TGN) marker VHAa1 and in nuclei of root meristems.

(D) Root area at the upper end of the meristem with diffuse nuclear AtVPS2.2-GFP localization. (E) Same root area as in D but labeled with the fluorescent DNA stain, DAPI. (F) Overlay of D and E. (G) Venn diagram of the overlap between AtVPS2.2-GFP interactors and proteins that have been isolated from and annotated to the nucleus. The colored AGI codes of the proteins correspond to the overlapping sectors. The first authors of the publications used for comparison are also color coded. This
PcG complex protein, a predominantely plasma membrane localized small Ras family GTPase, Rac1, and the phosphorylated histone 3 are recruited. 81  Based on these findings and similar to CHMP1, AtVPS2.2 probably participates also in nuclear events as well. AtVPS2.2-GFP Interacts with Extracellular Proteins Ten of the AtVPS2.2-GFP interactors have also been isolated in proteome studies aimed to enrich for extracellular proteins of the cell wall, the apoplast and the phloem sap (Figure  6 ). 54 , 82 , 83  None of these extracellular AtVPS2.2-GFP interactors belong to classical secretory proteins. However ESCRT proteins have been recently identified in the proteome of secreted vesicles of archaeal Sulfolobus species. 16  One explanation is that the mechanism of budding of vesicles in archeae is
domains on the inner side of the neck which is acidified by PLDα. This association supports membrane narrowing and lipid rearrangements at the neck of budding vesicles away from the cytoplasm so that membrane fission and fusion occurs. Since AtVPS2.2-GFP interacts also with other ESCRT-III components we propose that at least in plants the large membrane scaffolding complex consists of a mixture of AtSNF7, AtVPS2 and the associated AtVPS46 and AtVPS60 proteins.

self-assembly of ESCRT-III subunits SNF7, VPS24 and VPS2 inside the tube and neck stabilizes and narrows the membranes and ultimately leads to membrane scission. 94 In this study, we have identified and established novel partners of the ESCRT-III component AtVPS2.2-GFP, in particular dynamins and PLDα1 which might assist in pinching off vesicular packages from membranes to deliver cargoes to other subcellular or even extracellular compartments. Similar to ESCRT-subunits, dynamins assemble on membrane surfaces and are able to scaffold membranes
MATERIALS AND METHODS:
obtained from Aventis CropScience and maintained after the protocol of Menges and Murray. 41  For protoplast transformation, we principally followed the protocol of Sheen 42  with 50 mL of a five day old MM2D culture. Cloning of AtVPS2.2-GFP and Functional Complementation Genomic DNA was isolated from seedlings by a modified Cetyltrimethylammoniumbromid (CTAB) method. 43  A fragment of 3.3 kb from the At5g44560 gene including 2141 bp coding, 644 bp promoter, 124 bp 5′, 175 bp 3′
DNA with primers 5g44560–5Bam and 5g44560–3Bam and cloned into the  Bam HI site of the pPZP211 plasmid. The final construct (pPZP-AtVPS2.2) was verified by sequencing and transformed into  Agrobacterium tumefaciens  (GV3101) by electroporation. For cloning of AtVPS2.2-GFP, a 2807 bp subfragment of pPZP211-AtVPS2.2 was PCR amplified using primer 5g44560_GFP_SacI_pm and 5g44560_GFP_NcoI_R, and subcloned into pCR4-TOPO for sequence verification. Using SacI/NcoI the insert was transferred to the binary GFP-containing vector pGreenII0029–35S-GFP-RL replacing the 35S promoter. The final construct AtVPS2.2-GFP was transformed into  Agrobacterium tumefaciens  strain GV3101pSoup by electroporation and used to transform wild-type (WS, Col) and  hya/vps2.2–2 ,  hya/vps2.2–3  plants. Transformants were selected on MS medium containing kanamycin (100 μg mL –1 ). The functionality of transgenic lines was determined with root growth measurements on seven day qold seedlings. Microscopic Analyses Protoplasts from the BiFC assays, roots of Col;AtVPS2.2-GFP and the F1 of a cross between Col;AtVPS2.2-GFP and the trans-Golgi network (TGN) marker VHAa1-mRFP were observed under the stereomicroscope (DC500, Leica, Germany) and with the confocal laser scanning microscope (CLSM) (TCS-SP2 and SP5 II, Leica, Germany). Whole seedlings were mounted either in water or low melting agarose (LM; 1/2 MS, 1% sucrose) on slides with petroleum jelly borders to create a chamber. To visualize the nuclei 5 days old seedlings were fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde in 1× PBT (130 mM NaCl, 10 mM phosphate puffer pH 7.0, 0.1% Tween
with 40 mL 1× PBT, stained with 1 μg mL –1  4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) for 3 min, washed again extensively with 40 mL tap water and mounted. Excitation wavelengths were 405 nm for DAPI, 488 nm (argon laser) for GFP/YFP and 561 nm for mRFP. Emissions were detected between 425 and 480 nm for DAPI, 500–535 nm for GFP, 518–548 nm for YFP and 570–651 nm for mRFP. Images were taken with a long distance 63× water-immersion objective. Pictures were prepared for publication with the Leica LAS AF Lite, ImageJ and Paint Shop Pro 5 software. Plant Extraction and Western Blot Roots and shoots of approximately 50 16-days old seedlings expressing AtVPS2.2-GFP and a control GFP-construct were harvested lysed with 150 μL cracking buffer (60 mM Tris pH 6.8, 1% 2-mercaptoethanol, 1% SDS; 10% glycerol, 0.01% bromophenol blue) and denatured for 10 min at 95 °C. Fifteen μL of these extracts were loaded on a
V on a PVDV membrane (Roth, Germany). The membrane was blocked with 5% low fat milk powder in 1× TBST (20 mM Tris.HCl, pH 7.5 and 137 mM NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) for 1 h at room temperature. The AtVPS2.2-GFP fusion protein was detected in 1× TBST with anti-GFP (Roche, 1:1000) as primary, antimouse IgG-HRP (horseradish peroxidase) as secondary antibody (Amersham, 1:10000) and by chemiluminescence using Roti-Lumin as substrate (Roth, Germany). Immunoprecipitations For the pull down assays the μMACS epitope tag protein isolation kit was used (Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany). Roughly 300 mg roots of 10–14 days old seedlings expressing AtVPS2.2-GFP, wildtype (Columbia) or 35S::GFP were harvested, lysed with 1.5 mL lysis buffer (150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 50 mM Tris HCl pH 8.0) supplemented with 50 μL Pefablock (0.2 M, Roth, Germany) and incubated on ice for 30 min. After a second addition of 50 μL Pefablock (0.2 M) and 5 μL DTT (1 M) the solution was cleared from cell debris by centrifugation (10 min at 13.000 rpm at 4 °C). 50 μL anti-GFP μMACS MicroBeads (Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany) were added to the supernatant, mixed by rotating and incubated for 50 min on ice. Samples were loaded on μ Columns and washed five times with 200 μL wash buffer 1 and
μL elution buffer (Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany) and 15–20 μL were loaded on a 12% PAGE. Proteins were fixed in 50% MeOH and 5% HAc for 20 min and after washing in distilled water overnight, visualized with a LC–MS/MS compatible silver staining protocol. 44  The gel was sensitized 1 min in 1.2 mM Na
two 1 min washes with distilled water, the protein bands were developed with 188 mM Na 2 CO 3  and 0.04% formaldehyd. Staining was stopped with 5% HAc and stored at 4 °C in 1% HAc. Enzymatic Digest, LC–MS/MS and Data Analysis Silver stained samples were used for the nanoelectrospray LC–MS/MS investigations. Selected gel bands were
for Mascot search was the nr protein database of NIH (NCBI Resources, NIH, Bethesda, MD), taxonomy was Arabidopsis. The data of the first two pull down assays were analyzed with the nr database version of 16th Jan 2007, the MS/MS data of the third pull down was searched against the nr database
(BD BIOSIENCES, France) and recombined into the vectors pUC-SPYNE and pUC-SPYCE. 47  All constructs were confirmed by sequencing. Empty vector combinations were cotransformed as negative controls. Interactions were scored from three independent transformations with the CLSM. Classification of AtVPS2.2-GFP-interacting Proteins The proteins were classified according to their molecular function as determined on the basis of the available literature and of the gene ontology database in TAIR ( www.arabidopsis.org/tools/bulk/go/index.jsp ). The percentage of proteins in each category was calculated
