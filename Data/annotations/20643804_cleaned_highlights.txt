ABSTRACT:
unclear. In this study, it is shown that cold treatment increased  WRKY34  expression in the wild type, and promoter-GUS analysis revealed that  WRKY34  expression is pollen-specific. Enhanced green fluorescent protein-tagged WRKY34 was localized in the nuclei. Pollen harbouring the  wrky34  allele showed higher viability than pollen with the  WRKY34  allele after cold treatment. Further functional analysis indicated that the WRKY34 transcription factor was involved in pollen development regulated by the pollen-specific
RESULTS:
 WRKY34–GFP  fusion protein expressed in  N. benthamiana  epidermal cells. The cells were examined with brightfield (top) and UV fluorescence (middle) microscopy, and as a merged image (bottom) showing either the diffused (control plasmid) or the nuclear localization
independent biological samples. Differences between the untreated and treated plants with cold stress are significant at  P  <0.01 (**). As shown in  Fig. 1 , the fluorescence signal of the WRKY34-eGFP construct was detected in the nuclei of the  Nicotiana benthamiana  cells ( Fig. 1E ). Quantitative RT-PCR revealed that  WRKY34  transcription in mature pollen increased by more than 7-fold after 24 h or 48 h
MATERIALS AND METHODS:
Transformation and GUS staining was performed as described by  Yang  et al.  (2003) . Subcellular localization of WRKY34 The  WRKY34  full-length cDNA was linked to the pBluscript KS II vector, and the enhanced green fluorescent reporter gene ( eGFP ) was subcloned behind the  WRKY34  cDNA. The  WRKY34–eGFP  fragment was cloned by ligation into the sites behind the CaMV 35S promoter of pOCA30. The plasmid was isolated using Qiagen kits (Valencia, CA, USA), and concentrated to about 1 μg μl −1 . The recombinant plasmid was
