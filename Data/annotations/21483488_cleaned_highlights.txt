ABSTRACT:
active defense against biotrophic pathogens is dependent on a functional continuum between the cell wall (CW) and the plasma membrane (PM). It is thus anticipated that proteins maintaining this continuum also function in defense. The legume-like lectin receptor kinase LecRK-I.9 is a putative mediator of CW-PM adhesions in Arabidopsis and is known to bind  in vitro  to the  Phytophthora infestans  RXLR-dEER effector IPI-O via a RGD cell attachment motif present in IPI-O. Here we show that LecRK-I.9 is associated with the plasma membrane, and that two T-DNA insertions lines deficient in LecRK-I.9 ( lecrk-I.9 ) have a ‘gain-of-susceptibility’ phenotype specifically towards the oomycete  Phytophthora brassicae . Accordingly, overexpression of  LecRK-I.9  leads to enhanced resistance to  P. brassicae .
RESULTS:
wounding (F). LecRK-I.9 is localized at the plasma membrane LecRK-I.9 contains a putative transmembrane domain  [20] , and hence hypothesized to be associated with a membrane. To determine the subcellular localization of LecRK-I.9 we constructed the binary vector pS-LecRK-I.9-GFP that is suitable for transient  in planta  expression of C-terminal GFP-tagged  LecRK-I.9 . Leaves of  Nicotiana benthamiana  were co-infiltrated with 
endoplasmic reticulum network that surrounds the nucleus, nor in cytoplasmic strands (data not shown). GFP fluorescence at the plasma membrane and distinct from free mCherry was reproducible in several independent experiments. This demonstrates that in these transient expression assays LecRK-I.9-GFP is targeted to the plasma membrane and points to association of LecRK-I.9 with the plasma membrane. 10.1371/journal.ppat.1001327.g002 Figure 2 LecRK-I.9 is localized at the plasma membrane.

MATERIALS AND METHODS:
BAC clone F15L12.17 with primers pK60300-s and pK60300-as or pK60300ms-as (Table S1). PCR fragments were cloned in pENTR/D-TOPO. LR recombination enabled cloning into binary vector pK2GW7 ( http://www.psb.ugent.be/gateway )  [53]  and pSOL2095 resulting in plasmids pK-35S-LecRK-I.9 and pS-35S-LecRK-I.9-GFP, respectively. Cloning steps were verified by sequencing. Binary vectors were transformed to  Agrobacterium tumefaciens  strain GV3101 or AGL1 and cultured on medium containing the appropriate antibiotics.  Arabidopsis thaliana  accession Col-0 was transformed by the floral dip method  [54] . Transformed plants were selected on MS agar with 50 mg/l kanamycin. Rooted seedlings were subsequently
4°C in 80% methanol containing 1% HCl. Brightfield and fluorescence microscopy was performed with a Nikon 90i epifluorescence microscope (Nikon, Amstelveen, The Netherlands). GFP and mCherry were visualized using a GFP-B (EX 460–500, DM 505, BA 510–560) and a TRITC (EX 540/25, DM 565, BA 606/55) filter cube. Confocol laser scanning microscopy was performed using a Zeiss Confocor 2–LSM 510 (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany). GFP and mCherry were excited with an Argon (488 nm line) and HeNe (543 nm line) laser, respectively. Fluorescence was captured through the band-pass emission filters BP505-530 (GFP) and 600–650 nm (mCherry). To visualize callose deposition, Arabidopsis leaves were harvested approximately 18 h after inoculation with bacteria or infiltration with 10 µM flg22, cleared overnight in an ethanol series (70–96%) and stained with 1% (w/v) aniline blue in 150 mM K 2 HPO 4  (pH 9.5) for 1 h. Stained leaves were mounted in 50% glycerol, and fluorescent callose deposits were viewed using epifluorescence microscopy (DAPI filter; EX340-380, DM 400, BA 435-4850). Images of randomly selected fields were captured using a Nikon DS-5Mc digital camera and processed with ImageJ software ( http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij ) to calculate the total
