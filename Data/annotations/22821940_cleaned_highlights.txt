ABSTRACT:
RESULTS:
that AHG11 localizes at the plasma membrane ( Mitra  et al ., 2009 ). To determine the subcellular localization of AHG11, the N-terminal portion of AHG11 (83 aa from the most upstream ATG codon) was fused to a GFP gene to form the AHG11-GFP fusion
MATERIALS AND METHODS:
Columbia (Col) and Landsberg  erecta  (L er ) were used. Plant growth conditions were as described previously ( Nishimura  et al ., 2004 ). Ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS)-mutagenized M 2  seeds were obtained as follows:  aba2-1  seeds were treated with 0.3% EMS for 16h at room temperature ( c . 2000 seeds per parental group), washed extensively with water, and sown on soil. M 2  generation seeds were separately harvested and formed independent
and hybridized with a DIG labelled  nad4  DNA probe. DNA labelling and detection were performed with a DIG High Prime DNA labelling and Detection Starter Kit II (Roche Diagnostics Japan, Tokyo) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Analysis of GFP-fusion proteins DNA segments containing the AHG11 N-terminal portion (18505110nt–18505358nt of the chromosome II sequence) or the AHG11 open reading frame (18505110nt–18506903nt) were amplified using F- Bam HINdeI3/R Xba 2 primer set or F- Bam HINdeI3/AHG11-N- Xba  primer set, respectively (see  Supplementary Table S1  at  JXB  online), and fused to the SGFP gene downstream of the CaMV 35S promoter in pTH-2 ( Chiu  et al ., 1996 ).
