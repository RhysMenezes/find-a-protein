ABSTRACT:
a Ca 2+ -dependent manner and interacts with all AtCaM isoforms but not with the CaM-like proteins CML8 and CML9. CaM interaction with the full-length channel was demonstrated in planta, using bimolecular fluorescence complementation. This interaction occurred at the plasma membrane, in accordance with our localization data of green fluorescent protein (GFP)-fused CNGC20 proteins. The CaM-binding site was mapped to an isoleucine glutamine (IQ) motif, which has not been characterized in plant CNGCs so far. Our results show that compared
RESULTS:
CaM overlay assay, and it was demonstrated that the interaction of CaM2 with CNGC20-C required the presence of Ca 2+  ( Fig. 3 C). CNGC20 is localized in the plasma membrane and interacts with calmodulin in vivo Green fluorescent protein (GFP) and mCherry fusion proteins were used to monitor the cellular distribution of CNGC20 and CaM2 proteins, respectively. GFP fluorescence was detected in the plasma membrane of mesophyll protoplasts and epidermal cells of  Nicotiana benthamiana  expressing a CNGC20–GFP fusion protein ( Fig. 4 A–C). Similarly, an N-terminal fusion of GFP resulted in plasma membrane localization of GFP–CNGC20 ( Fig. 4 D). In addition to the plasma membrane localization, we frequently observed punctuate structures within cells exhibiting strong expression ( Fig. 5 A). As fluorescence from CNGC–GFP fusion proteins can be observed along the secretory pathway to the plasma membrane ( Christopher et al. 2007 ), these dots may highlight the involved organelles.

All constructs were expressed in tobacco epidermal cells. Bars represent 10 µm (A) and 20 µm (B). In addition to the fluorescence at the plasma membrane, dots near the plasma membrane were often visible. Upon co-expression of CNGC20–GFP and CaM2–mCherry in tobacco leaves, red fluorescence from the latter protein was equally distributed between the cytosol and the nucleus and was localized near the plasma membrane ( Fig. 4 E–H). Thus, according to their physical vicinity, CaM2 and

A nuclear localization sequence within the IQ domain directs the C-terminus of CNGC20 into the nucleus To monitor the cellular localization of the isolated C-terminal fragment of CNGC20 used before, we fused it N-terminally to GFP (CNGC20-C–GFP). CNGC20-C–GFP accumulated in the nucleus rather than in the cytosol of mesophyll protoplasts and epidermal cells ( Fig. 8 A–D). A nuclear localization sequence (NLS) of the type [YFW]RRRR[PL] is present within the IQ domain of the CNGC20 C-terminus ( Rost et al. 2004 ). We therefore substituted the first three of four arginine residues within the NLS, and the resulting mutant CNGC20-C AAA –GFP was analysed for its localization. Indeed, the absence of the NLS prevented nuclear accumulation of CNGC20-C AAA –GFP, as concluded from the GFP fluorescence equilibrating between the nucleus and the cytosol ( Fig. 8 E,  F ). This shows that CNGC20 exhibits a functional NLS, which is part of the IQ domain. However, the NLS was not required for the targeting of the full-length channel, since GFP fusion proteins of CNGC20 lacking the IQ/NLS domain (CNGC20-ΔC34) reached the plasma membrane ( Fig. 8 G).

MATERIALS AND METHODS:
studies, the constucts used as bait were recombined into pGBT9-GW and prey constructs into pGAD424-GW, kindly provided by F. Börnke, Erlangen University. pVYNE, pVYNE(R) and pVYCE(R) ( Gehl et al. 2009 ) were used for BiFC assays. For N-terminal GFP fusions, the pMDC43 destination vector was used ( Curtis et al. 2003 ). A C-terminal GFP fusion was achieved using the destination vector pK7FWG2,0 ( Karimi et al. 2002 ). For C-terminal mCherry fusions, pMDC201-mCherry was produced by a replacement of GFP by mCherry. mCherry was kindly provided by R. Stadler (Erlangen Universiy). Restriction sites  Asc I and  Bst BI were added to mCherry by an amplification using primers 28 and 29 ( Supplementary Table S2 ) and the digested fragment was used to substitute the GFP in pMDC201 ( Curtis et al. 2003 ). For a maltose-binding protein (MBP) fusion to the CNGC20 C- terminus, the latter was amplified with primers 30 and 31 and introduced into pMal-c2x (New England Biolabs) via  Xmn I

Confocal microscopy Confocal laser scanning microscopy (Leica TCS SP II; Leica Microsystems) was used with laser excitation at 488 nm for GFP, mCherry and propidium iodide (PI), and at 514 nm for Venus.
