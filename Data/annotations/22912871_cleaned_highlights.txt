ABSTRACT:
RESULTS:
localized to the nucleus  [18] ,  [23] ,  [34] – [37] . We used a polyethylene glycol (PEG)-mediated transient expression system in  Arabidopsis  mesophyll protoplasts to determine the subcellular localization of GFP fusions of IAA8, which functions as a transcriptional repressor ( Figure 1 ), and also of the well-characterized Aux/IAA proteins,  Arabidopsis  IAA7 and IAA17. NLS-tdTomato, a nuclear marker consisting of a fusion of simian virus 40 (SV40) large T antigen NLS  [38]  and red fluorescent protein tdTomato, was co-expressed with the GFP fusions in protoplasts. IAA7-GFP and IAA17-GFP localized exclusively to the nucleus, as previously reported  [18] , whereas IAA8-GFP localized to both the nucleus and the cytosol ( Figure 3 ). 10.1371/journal.pone.0043414.g003 Figure 3 Subcellular localization of IAA7, IAA8, and IAA17. GFP fusions of IAA7, IAA8, and IAA17 were transiently expressed in  Arabidopsis  mesophyll protoplasts. NLS-tdTomato was co-introduced both as a nuclear marker and as a control for transformation. GFP, NLS, and BF (top) represent GFP and tdTomato fluorescence and bright field images, respectively. n: nucleus, c: cytosol. Bars  = 10 μm. IAA8 interacts with auxin receptor TIR1 in an auxin-dependent fashion A key event in the transcriptional regulation of the auxin response is the degradation
between TIR1 and IAA8 as well as IAA7 and IAA17  in planta  ( Figure 4B , right). The YFP fluorescence resulting from the interaction between TIR1 and Aux/IAA proteins in BiFC assays was present only in the nucleus. 10.1371/journal.pone.0043414.g004 Figure 4 Auxin-dependent interaction of IAA8 with the TIR1 auxin receptor. (A) Yeast (EGY48::pJK103) cells were co-transformed with bait
(−IAA). (B) The BiFC assay was used to detect protein-protein interactions between Aux/IAA repressors and TIR1.  nYFP-Aux/IAA  fusions or  nYFP-GUS  and  cYFP-TIR1  were transiently co-expressed in  Arabidopsis  mesophyll protoplasts with a nucleus marker plasmid, NLS-tdTomato. To monitor the auxin-dependent interaction, 10 μM IAA was added before microscopic observation (+IAA). BiFC, NLS and BF (top) represent YFP, tdTomato fluorescence, and bright field images, respectively. n: nucleus. Bars  = 10 μm. IAA8 interacts with ARF transcription factors The expression of auxin-responsive genes is directly controlled by the transcriptional activity of ARF transcription factors  [5] . Five of
(B) A BiFC assay was carried out to monitor the protein-protein interaction between IAA8 and ARFs.  ARF-nYFP  fusions or  nYFP-GUS  and  IAA8-cYFP  were transiently co-expressed in  Arabidopsis  mesophyll protoplasts with a nuclear marker plasmid, NLS-tdTomato. BiFC, NLS, and BF (top) represent YFP, tdTomato fluorescence, and bright field images, respectively. n: nucleus. Bars  = 10 μm. To further analyze the  in planta  protein-protein interaction between Aux/IAA proteins and ARFs, we performed a BiFC analysis by transiently expressing ARF-nYFP fusions, the C-terminal fusion of ARF with nYFP, and IAA8-cYFP, the C-terminal
MATERIALS AND METHODS:
MS medium as described above were immersed in 10 μM β-estradiol for 24 h (estrogen treatment) and then transferred to 1 μM indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) solution (auxin treatment). Total RNA was isolated using Total RNA Extraction Kit Mini (Plant) (RBC
Roche) antibodies were used for the detection of LexA DNA-binding domain fusion of IAA8 and activation domain with HA tag fusion of each ARFCTD, respectively. Luminata Crescendo Western HRP substrate (Millipore) was used for chemiluminescent detection. Plasmid Construction for GFP fusions and BiFC analysis For the construction of  IAA7- ,  IAA8-  and  IAA17-GFP  fusions driven by the CaMV 35S promoter, all IAA cDNA fragments made as described above were transferred into p2GWF7  [55] , using LR Clonase II (Invitrogen). Similarly, for the construction of nYFP or cYFP fusion genes, which were driven by the CaMV 35S promoter for BiFC experiments, full-length cDNAs of  ARF3 ,  ARF4 ,  ARF5 ,  ARF7 ,  ARF11 ,  ARF16,  and  ARF19  were
[52]  as template and cloned into pDONRzeo using the Gateway BP recombination reaction. The gene-specific primers for PCR are listed in Table S1. After verifying the nucleotide sequence of PCR fragments of ARF full-length cDNAs by sequencing,  nYFP-Aux/IAAs ,  ARFs-nYFP, cYFP-TIR1,  and  IAA8-cYFP  fusions driven by the CaMV 35S promoter were constructed by transferring  Aux/IAA, ARF, TIR1,  and  IAA8  full-length cDNAs into nYFP/pUGW0, nYFP/pUGW2, cYFP/pUGW0, and cYFP/pUGW2  [56] , respectively, using the Gateway LR recombination reaction. As a negative control, nYFP-GUS driven by the CaMV 35S promoter was also created using nYFP/pUGW0 and pENTR-gus (Invitrogen), as
GFP-fusion plasmid or 10 μg of nYFP- and cYFP-fusion plasmids for BiFC analysis and 1 μg of NLS-tdTomato plasmid were assayed for fluorescence 20–24 h after transfection using a confocal laser scanning microscope (Fluoview FV10i-O; Olympus). To evaluate the TIR1-IAA interaction by BiFC analysis, 10 μM IAA was added to the transfected protoplast solution 30–60 min before microscopic observation. The fluorescence signals from GFP, YFP, and tdTomato were excited by 489-, 480-, and 580-nm wavelengths, respectively, and emissions were
