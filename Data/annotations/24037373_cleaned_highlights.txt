appears in yellow when RFP signal co-localizes with MitoTracker staining indicating a localization of the fusion protein in mitochondria whereas it appears in violet when RFP signal is localized in plastids. It was detected that 68 and 31 300 bp-PPR constructs gave an exclusive mitochondrial and plastid localization, respectively, as exemplified by AT3G15130 and AT3G46610 in  Figure 1A . Interestingly, 24 constructs exhibited a signal
other five. Among the nine PPR proteins thought to be out of the organelles on the base of the first 100 amino acids, seven ORFs were successfully cloned but no cytosolic localization was confirmed: the whole proteins fused to RFP were systematically addressed to one or both organelles, as exemplified by AT1G06150 and AT1G06580 in  Figure 1B . Surprisingly, six of them were localized in both organelles (AT1G06150 in 
in the nucleus (2). These reverse genetics studies are very strong statements of PPR localization, which could be considered as true localization. When compared with this very high quality data set, our data as well as all data of fluorescent protein localization
MATERIALS AND METHODS:
BP Clonase® II Enzyme mix (Invitrogen) as described. 11  For microscopic investigation, LR recombination reactions were performed using Gateway® LR Clonase® Enzyme Mix (Invitrogen) in order to transfer PPR sequences from Entry vectors to the pGREENII-derived destination vector p0229-RFP2 11  allowing C-terminal translational fusion with the RFP protein under the control of the 2X35S promoter. The proper ORF fusion was confirmed by sequencing using P35STL (5′-CGAATCTCAA GCAATCAAGC-3′) and RFP2rev (5′-TGAACTCGGT GATGACGTTC-3′) primers. Binary vectors were introduced into thermo-competent  Agrobacterium tumefaciens  strain C58C1 harboring the helper plasmid pSOUP. 88  A single resistant colony was then used to inoculate 5 mL of Luria Bertani medium supplemented with
Basidiomycetes sp..  (Sigma-Aldrich) and 2 g.L −1  Cellulase Onozuka RS from  Trichoderma viride  (SERVA Electrophoresis GmbH) at 28 °C for 2–4 h. 89  Protoplasts were observed using an Eclipse TE2000S inverted microscope (Nikon) and RFP signal monitored using a custom filter block (exciter HQ546/12, emitter HQ605/75, beam-splitter Q560lp; Chroma Technology). For each
authors. To confirm mitochondrial localizations, protoplasts were stained with 1 µM MitoTracker Green (Invitrogen) for 15–30 min. For confocal microscopy, proteins were visualized using a spectral Leica SP2 AOBS confocal microscope (Leica Microsystems) equipped with argon and HeNe lasers. Fluorescent signals were detected with a sequential configuration using a 488 nm laser line (MitoTracker Green: excitation/emission 488/510–530 nm) and a 543 nm laser line (RFP: excitation/emission 543/570–600 nm
