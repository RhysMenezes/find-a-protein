ABSTRACT:
ABSTRACT The mitochondrion is an important power generator in most eukaryotic cells. To preserve its function, many essential nuclear-encoded factors play specific roles in mitochondrial RNA metabolic processes, including RNA editing. RNA editing consists of post-transcriptional deamination, which alters specific nucleotides in transcripts to mediate gene expression. In plant cells, many pentatricopeptide repeat proteins (PPRs) participate in diverse

cycle at 22°C. After 21-days of germination on MS medium,  ppme  homozygous seedlings were transferred to soil for further growth. Complementation of the homozygous  ppme −/− mutant The coding region and 4.3-kb genomic fragments of  PPME  were amplified using the following primers: 5′-BamHI-ATGTTCTTCGTCACTCGTCTGCG-3′, 5′-BamHI-CTATCCTGAGGTTGCAGGGTTTG-3′, 5′-BamHI-TTTGCCAGCAAAAATTTCACAG-3′, and 5′-BamHI-TCCTGAGGTTGCAGGGTTTG-3′. Phusion polymerase (Finnzymes) was used for amplification, and the amplicons were ligated into a pPZP221 vector harboring a C-terminal GFP sequence followed by the nopaline synthase (NOS) terminator. An  Agrobacterium tumefaciens  strain, GV3101, was used for transformation
plants were harvested and sprayed onto 1/2 MS medium with 125 mg/ml gentamycin. Plants with a  ppme  homozygous background that were transformed with constructs were selected. T3 homozygous transgenic plants were used in further experiments. Subcellular localization of PPME PPME cellular localization was evaluated in root hair cells from homozygous  PPMEg-GFP  transgenic plants with a  ppme  homozygous background. Seven-day-old seedlings were stained with MitoTracker Orange (Molecular 587 Probes, Eugene, OR, USA) and observed using a confocal microscope, with excitation at 488 nm/543 nm and BP505-530/BP560-615 IR detection filters (510

The recombinant proteins were expressed at 28°C after 4-hr induction with 1 mM IPTG and were then further purified using Dextrin Sepharose High-Performance Chromatography Resin (GE). Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) The following primer sets were used to synthesize  nad1- 898 and  atp9- 83 probes, respectively, via  in vitro  transcription using T7 RNA polymerase (Promega): 5′-TAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGACATTTCCACGATATCGTTATG-3′ and 5′-AGAGGCAAGAACACTTTCCGGCCAAGTCC-3′; and 5′-TAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGACGGTGCAAAATCAATAG-3′ and 5′-TACCGATAGCAGCTCCCGCTGAAGC-3′. Further, the following synthetic

The probes were further labeled with γ- 32 P ATP for subsequent EMSA. Probes (2.5 nM) were incubated with different concentrations of MBP-PPME recombinant protein (0, 0.75, 1.5 and 3 μM) at 25°C for 30 min in 20 μl buffer containing 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 180 mM NaCl, 2 mM DTT, 1.7μg/ml BSA, 0.5 mM EDTA, 8.3% glycerol, and
