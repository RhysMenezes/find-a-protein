RESULTS:
RESULTS Exo70E2 is required for the membrane recruitment of a number of exocyst subunits When transiently expressed in  Arabidopsis  protoplasts both green fluorescent protein (GFP)– and red fluorescent protein (RFP)–tagged versions of AtExo70E2 localize as discrete punctae at the plasma membrane and in the cytoplasm. Coexpression of both tagged versions produces completely overlapping signals for GFP and RFP (Supplemental Figure S1). As previously described, we interpret the fluorescent punctae as representing EXPO
). The same result was obtained with Sec3a and Sec15b (Supplemental Figure S2). That the recruitment of Exo70E2 serves as a nucleus for the recruitment of other exocyst subunits was underlined by triple-expression experiments. These showed perfect colocalization of fluorescent punctae when Exo70E2 was expressed together with Sec6 and Sec8 ( Figure 2, a–d ) or with Sec6 and Sec10 ( Figure 2, e–h ). FIGURE 1: Recruitment of Sec exocyst subunit proteins to Exo70E2-positive organelles (EXPOs) by Exo70E2. When expressed individually in  Arabidopsis  protoplasts, GFP/YFP-tagged Sec exocyst proteins give rise to a cytosolic pattern. However, after coelectroporation as indicated, the different Sec exocyst proteins show in addition a punctate pattern and are colocalized with fluorescent protein–tagged Exo70E2. Bar, 20 μm. FIGURE 2: Multiple recruitment of Sec exocyst proteins to the same EXPO
recruitment of other, but not all, Exo70 subunits We performed single and coexpression experiments with Exo70E2 and a number of other Exo70 subunits. Of these, GFP-tagged Exo70A1 and Exo70B1 gave rise to punctate signals in addition to a diffuse cytosolic background. Nevertheless, positive corecruitment with Exo70E2 was observed with these two Exo70 paralogues ( Figure 3, a–d and e–h ). In contrast, both Exo70E1 and
Exo70E2 but nevertheless did give rise to fluorescent punctae (Supplemental Figure S5, a–d). FIGURE 3: Some Exo70 exocyst proteins can be recruited to EXPO by Exo70E2. When expressed individually in  Arabidopsis  protoplasts, different Exo70 proteins gave strong cytosolic patterns. After coelectroporation with fluorescent protein–tagged Exo70E2 as indicated, these proteins show a punctate pattern and are colocalized with Exo70E2. Bar, 20 μm. FIGURE 4: Other Exo70 exocyst proteins do not show EXPO recruitment with Exo70E2. Whether singly expressed or coexpressed with Exo70E2-mRFP in  Arabidopsis  protoplasts, a number of other Exo70 exocyst proteins give rise to only cytosolic patterns. Bar, 20 μm. Recruitment of Sec6 by Exo70E2 also occurs when using an endogenous promoter To counteract the argument that the transient expression of Exo70E2 is artifactual through the use of the 35S promoter, we generated an Exo70E2-GFP
Exo70A1-GFP gave rise to fluorescent punctae, these did not lead to a corecruitment of Sec6, Sec8, or Sec10 when coexpressed ( Figure 6, a–d, e–h, and i–l ). Instead, the signals for Sec6, Sec8, and Sec10 remained diffuse and cytosolic. FIGURE 6: Exo70A1 cannot recruit Sec exocyst proteins to EXPO. Various Sec exocyst proteins remain cytosolic even when coexpressed with Exo70A1-GFP in  Arabidopsis  protoplasts, even though Exo70A1-GFP itself produces fluorescent punctae. Bar, 20 μm. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer assay and bimolecular fluorescence complementation confirm interactions between Exo70E2 and other exocyst subunits Because colocalization
Figure 8A, e and f ). However, when coexpressed with AtExo70E2-mRFP, there was no overlap with the punctate human Exo70-GFP signals ( Figure 8A, i–l ). We also expressed yeast Exo70-GFP in HEK cells but only observed a diffuse cytosolic fluorescence ( Figure 8A, g and h ). FIGURE 8: Overexpression of AtExo70E2-GFP also leads to the formation of EXPO-like structures in mammalian HEK293A cells.

Neither human nor yeast Exo70 can induce EXPO in plant protoplasts To determine whether
We performed immunofluorescence with antibodies directed against a number of standard organelle markers on HEK cells expressing AtExo70E2-GFP. The fluorescent punctae obtained did not overlap with any standard organelle markers for early endosomes ( Figure 9, a–d ), the Golgi apparatus ( Figure 9, e–h ), late endosomes or lysosomes ( Figure 9, i–l and m–p ),
autophagosomes at different conditions in mammalian HEK293A cells. Immunofluorescence with autophagosome marker antibody anti-ATG9a demonstrates that AtExo70E2-GFP–positive organelles are different from autophagosomes with (e–h) or without (a–d) starvation treatment. Bar, 20 μm. Electron microscopy confirms the presence of EXPO-like, double-membrane structures in HEK cells after expression of AtExo70E2 EXPOs present in wild-type BY-2 cells, and also
reveal the presence of double-membraned, EXPO-like structures ( Figure 11, d and e ). EXPO-like membrane structures were not found in control, nontransfected HEK cells.

MATERIALS AND METHODS:
vector with different fluorescent tags at the N-terminus or C-terminus using specific restriction cutting sites to generate the various fusion constructs under the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter and the nopaline synthase terminator. cDNAs coding for full-length  Arabidopsis Exo70E2 , yeast 
 BY 4743, or cDNA from human HEK293A culture cells with different primer sets listed in Supplemental Table S2. The amplified fragments were then cloned into pBI221, pEGFP-N1/C1 (Clontech, Mountain View, CA) or pDsRed-N1 (Clontech), respectively. For the  Exo70E2  promoter:: Exo70E2-GFP  construct, the  Exo70E2  promoter sequence was amplified as previously described ( Li  et al. , 2010 ) by using the primer set listed in Supplemental Table S2. The PCR fragment was digested with  Cla I/ Bam HI and then ligated into the premade pBI121 vector containing the  Exo70E2-GFP  coding sequence described previously ( Wang  et al. , 2010b ) to replace the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter. Plant material and transient expression in protoplasts Procedures for maintaining  Arabidopsis  suspension cultured cells were as described
plasmids using jetPEI transfection reagent (PolyPlus, New York, NY). Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for immunolabeling and confocal imaging. Generation of HEK293A stable cell line Transfection of linearized AtExo70E2-GFP plasmid was carried out in 24-well tissue culture plates containing 50,000 cells using jetPEI transfection reagent. The medium was replaced 24 h after transfection by DMEM supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum and 1% penicillin and streptomycin. At
Geneticin. Then cells were fed with fresh medium every day and passaged upon reaching confluence by trypsinization. Cells were selected for at least 14 d before proceeding to cloning by limited dilution. To isolate monoclonal cell lines with highest AtExo70E2-GFP expression, cells were subcloned by seeding 50, 100, and 200 cells into three separate 96-well tissue culture plates and maintained in selective medium supplemented with 500 μg/ml Geneticin. After 1 wk, cells were trypsinized and passed to another 96-well
4% paraformaldehyde, and examined under a fluorescence microscope. Subclones that gave good AtExo70E2 expression were frozen and proceeded to other rounds of subcloning until single-cell subclones that gave good AtExo70E2 expression were obtained. Immunofluorescence studies Fixation and preparation of AtExo70E2GFP-transformed HEK293A cells and their labeling and analysis by confocal immunofluorescence were described previously ( Jiang and Rogers, 1998 ;  Jiang  et al. , 2000 ;  Miao  et al. , 2008 ,  2011 ;  Wang 
for collecting confocal images and processing of images using Photoshop (Adobe, San Jose, CA) were as described previously ( Cai  et al. , 2011 ;  Shen  et al. , 2013 ). Autophagy induction of HEK293A transgenic cells expressing AtExo70E2-GFP by starvation Starvation of HEK293A transgenic cells to induce autophagy was performed as previously described ( Munafo and Colombo, 2001 ;  Martinet  et al. , 2006 ). Generally, the normal cultured cells were washed three times with PBS and then incubated in Earle's balanced salts solution at 37°C for 2 h to induce autophagosome formation. Electron microscopy of resin-embedded cells The general procedures for transmission electron microscopy, sample preparation, and thin sectioning of resin blocks of AtExo70E2GFP-transformed HEK293A cells were performed essentially as described previously ( Tse  et al. , 2004 ;  Lam  et al. , 2007 ,  2008 ). For high-pressure freezing, AtExo70E2GFP-transformed HEK293A cells were harvested by trypsinization, gently spin down, and immediately frozen in a high-pressure freezing apparatus (EM Part2; Leica, Wetzlar, Germany). Immunolabeling on HM20 sections was done using standard procedures as described previously ( Tse  et al. , 2004 ) with Exo70E2 antibodies or GFP antibodies and gold-coupled secondary antibodies. Sections were poststained with aqueous uranyl acetate/lead citrate and then examined with a Hitachi H7650 transmission electron microscope (Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan) with a MacroFire monochrome charge-coupled device camera (Optronics) operating at
protoplasts were coelectroporated with different combinations of fusion proteins with split YFP. Fluorescence images were taken using a confocal laser scanning microscope (Olympus FluoView FV1000). Western blotting analysis Proteins were isolated from different HEK293A cells and fractionated on 10% SDS–PAGE, followed by Western blotting as previously described ( Cai  et al.
