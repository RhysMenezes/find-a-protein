ABSTRACT:
RESULTS:
This is particularly evident in the root division zone, where fluorescence signals were excluded from the hollow areas (i.e., nuclei) and were found in the cytoplasm ( Fig. 4 ). Fig. 4. Subcellular localization of AtLSG1-2 and AtLSG1-1. The YFP signal was detected in the cytosol of cells in cotyledon, root division zone, root elongation zone, and hypocotyl of plants transformed with  35S::YFP-AtLSG1-1  or  35S::AtLSG1-2-YFP . Arrows indicate nuclei. Scale bars, 50 µm. At least 10 transformed plants were examined. Loss of function of  AtLSG1-2  affects ribosome biogenesis To investigate the impact of AtLSG1-2 deficiency on ribosome biogenesis in plants, ribosome levels
MATERIALS AND METHODS:
::GUS fusion construct, a 2006bp promoter fragment from genomic DNA was amplified by PCR and first cloned into the pENTR TM /D-TOPO vector and subsequently cloned into the upstream of GUS in pMDC162 using GATEWAY technology. To construct  35S::AtLSG1-2–YFP  and  35S::YFP–AtLSG1-2 , the full-length  AtLSG1-2  coding region was cloned into the pENTR TM /D-TOPO vector and then into vectors pEarlygate 101 or  pEarlygate  104, respectively, to produce  p35S::AtLSG1-2-YFP  or  p35S::YFP-AtLSG1-2 . Using the same method,  AtLSG1-1  was cloned into the  pEarlygate  104 vector to construct  p35S::YFP-AtLSG1-1 . Information on primers used in this study is given in  Supplementary Table S2  available at  JXB  online. Plant transformation Transgenic plants were generated by transferring plasmids into  Arabidopsis  via the Agrobacterium-mediated flower-dipping
