ABSTRACT:
RESULTS:
to RBL10. Protein localization Transformation of a 35S–RBL10–GFP construct into  Arabidopsis  revealed that, as predicted by its putative signal peptide (see  Supplementary Fig. S1  at  JXB  online), RBL10 protein is localized to chloroplast membranes ( Fig. 3a, b, c ). In
leaves, the localized GFP appeared clearly external to the chlorophyll fluorescence of the chloroplast ( Fig. 3c ). The single N-terminal transit peptide of RBL10 would suggest the location of the mature rhomboid in the chloroplast inner or outer membrane, but the exact

Also of interest are the GFP-fluorescent membranes emanating from and linking the organelles: these can be seen in both root plastids and chloroplasts (see  Supplementary Fig. S2  at  JXB  online).

MATERIALS AND METHODS:
plates. Molecular biology DNA manipulation was performed essentially according to  Sambrook  et al.  (1989) . Primers for amplifying cDNA were 5′-ATGGTATCAGTGTCATTATCTCA-3′ and 5′-TCAAAGCCGTCGCTGTTCATT-3′, along with 5′-GGATTTAAGCTCGAGTCTGA-3′ and 5′-CACCAAGTAAGCCACCAA - 3′ for locating T-DNA insertions. For the RBL10-GFP fusion protein, primers were 5′-CGGGATCCGAAGATGGTATCAGTGTCA-3′ and 5′-GGAATTCAAGCCGTCGCTGTTCATT-3′. Primers for the RBL10 promoter were 5′-GCTCTAGACTTACATGTTACTAACTTCTA-3′ and 5′-TTCCCGGGATCTTCCCCTTCACGTTTC-3′. All constructs were based upon vectors from the John Innes Centre, Norwich, UK, or the gift of the J Haseloff group, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK, namely a CaMV 35S-eGFP-containing pGreen0029 vector for fusing RBL10 N-terminal of GFP, and pGreen0029 containing the β-glucuronidase gene for constructing the RBL10 promoter–GUS vector. For transcript analysis via RT-PCR, primers were used that would generate product across introns to differentiate any genomic contamination in template from transcript. To investigate transcript levels in specific tissues, RT-PCR was carried out using control primers to actin8 (5′-AGAAAGATGCGTATGTTGGTGA-3′ and 5′-CTGCTGGAAAGTGCTGAGGGAA-3′), and the appropriate template concentration was used. Binary vectors and plant transformation Promoter–β-glucuronidase (GUS) and 35S-RBL10-GFP-encoding vectors were transformed into wild-type or RBL10-mutant  Arabidopsis  as required for localization studies or complementation, via  Agrobacterium tumefaciens  and floral dipping ( Gilmartin and Bowler, 2002 ). Transformed plants (T 1 ) were grown on 1/2MS plates as above, supplemented with antibiotic as appropriate, and antibiotic-resistant plants were grown on in compost. Mutant complementation The RBL10-2 mutant was complemented to ensure a return of WT characteristics by transforming it with a WT copy of the RBL10 transcript fused N-terminal of GFP, under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) 35S promoter. Effects on seed and floral phenotypes were checked in three independent transformant lines. GUS staining For promoter–GUS localization, tissues were stained according to
Pollen and inflorescence tissues were examined using cryo-scanning electron microscopy (SEM; Oxford Instruments CT 1500, Abingdon, Oxfordshire, UK). The Alexander stain was carried out essentially according to  Pline  et al.  (2002) . Initial visualization to identify GFP-expressing plants was by epifluorescence (Nikon Eclipse 50i, epifluorescence visualized using the UV-2A filter block). For confocal microscopy, tissues were excited at the peak of GFP absorbance at 488 nm and emission recorded at 500–520 by confocal microscopy [Leica (Milton Keynes, UK) TCS-SP1, or TCS-SP5, equipped with Coherent Enterprise (Santa Paula, CA, USA) UV laser]. Samples were examined with a ×64 oil immersion objective lens
