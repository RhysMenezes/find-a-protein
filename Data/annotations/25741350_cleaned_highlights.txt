ABSTRACT:
Arabidopsis  plants treated with SA that  n -butanol inhibits the transcription of defense genes ( PR-1, WRKY38 ). Fluorescence microscopy of  Arabidopsis thaliana  mutants expressing  35S::NPR1-GFP  (nonexpressor pathogenesis related 1) revealed significantly decreased nuclear localization of NPR1 in the presence of  n -butanol. On the other hand,  n -butanol did not decrease the nuclear localization of NPR1 in  35S::npr1C82A-GFP  and  35S::npr1C216A-GFP  mutants constitutively expressing NPR1 monomers. Mass spectrometric analysis of plant extracts showed that  n -butanol significantly changes the metabolic fingerprinting while  t -butanol had no effect.
RESULTS:
apparent (Supplemental Figure  S1 ). n -Butanol affects NPR1 accumulation in nucleus We further intended to take a closer look at the site of  n -butanol action in the SA signaling pathway. To decipher, we used  35S::NPR1-GFP A. thaliana  transgenic plants. It was confirmed earlier that the treatment of these mutants with 2,6-dichloroisonicotinic acid (INA), a functional analog of SA, causes monomerization of NPR1, which is afterwards accumulated in the plant cell nucleus (Mou et al.,  2003 ). We treated 10-day-old  35S::NPR1-GFP A. thaliana  seedlings with 250 μM NaSA and observed a significant increase of fluorescence in the nuclei (Figures  2A,B ), the same effect was described for INA treatment. The accumulation of  35S::NPR1-GFP  in the nuclei in the presence of NaSA decreased after addition of 1%  n -butanol (Figures  2A,B ). When  t -butanol was applied as a negative control, no effect on the  35S::NPR1-GFP  accumulation in the nuclei was observed (Figures  2A,B ).  n -butanol alone decreased the basal accumulation of NPR1 in the nuclei in the control plants, while no effect was observed for  t -butanol. The localization of NPR1-GFP in the nuclei was verified by DAPI staining (Supplemental Figure  S2 ). All these results correlate with the aforementioned  PR-1  transcription analysis (Figure  1B ). Consequently, we wanted to examine whether the decreased amount of NPR1 in the nucleus caused by  n -butanol is due to the higher actvity of proteasomes in NPR1 degradation (Spoel et al.,  2009 ). For this experiment, we used  35S::npr1C82A-GFP  and  35S::npr1C216A-GFP  seedlings expressing constitutively monomerized NPR1, which is overaccumulated in the nucleus (Mou et al.,  2003 ). The treatment of these mutants with 0.1% and 1%  n -butanol did not decrease the accumulation of NPR1 in the
performed in three biological replicates with similar results. Figure 3 Effects of  n -butanol on the accumulation of NPR1 in the nuclei of  Arabidopsis thaliana  mutants constitutively expressing monomers of NPR1 . Ten-day-old seedlings of  35S::npr1C82A-GFP  and  35S::npr1C216A-GFP A. thaliana  mutants were treated 6 h with fresh MS medium (control), 0.1%  n -butanol and
 t -butanol had no effect (Figure  4B ). These results support our suggestion that  n -butanol inhibits the translocation of NPR1 to the nucleus. Accordingly, we also found that the  ICS1  transcription in  35S::npr1C82A-GFP  and  35S::npr1C216-GFP  mutants were significantly decreased but  n -butanol treatment partially reverted this effect (Figure  4C ).

Confocal microscopy The slide with seedlings was positioned onto an inverted platform (with a cover slip at the bottom) of the confocal laser scanning Zeiss LSM 5 DUO microscope. The GFP fluorescence was excited by the 488 nm line of a laser, the DAPI fluorescence was excited by the 405 nm line. The epidermal cells were viewed using an Zeiss Plan-Apochromat 20x/0,8 objective.

samples were kept on ice during the extraction. Prior to instrumental analysis, the samples were stored in a dark and dry environment at −70°C. The UHPLC–Q-TOF-MS analyses were performed using an Acquity Ultra-Performance LC system coupled to a Synapt G2 high definition mass spectrometer (Waters, USA). The LC separation was performed by an Acquity UPLC® HSS T3 column (100 × 1.8 mm, 1.7 μm particle size; Waters, USA). The gradient elution was used with the mobile phases consisting of (A) 0.1% formic

The MassLynx 4.1 software (Waters, USA) was used for data acquisition and the MarkerLynx software (Waters, USA) was used for data mining and processing. The software SIMCA (v. 13.0, Umetrics, Sweden) was then used for data processing based on Principal Components
