ABSTRACT:
the cytoplasm where Sm core proteins are added and snRNAs are modified at the 5′ and 3′ termini and in the nucleus where snRNP-specific proteins associate. U1 snRNP consists of U1 snRNA, seven Sm proteins and three snRNP-specific proteins, U1-70K, U1A, and U1C. It has been shown previously that after import to the nucleus U2 and U4/U6 snRNP-specific proteins first appear in Cajal bodies (CB) and then in splicing speckles. In addition, in cells grown under normal conditions U2, U4,
RESULTS:
from the  Figure 1A  all three proteins localised to the nucleus. However, U1-70K was exclusively found in the nucleus whereas U1A and U1C were found in the nucleus and in the cytoplasm in virtually all cells. As GFP is a rather large tag, it could possibly influence the import of small proteins (U1A and U1C) into the nucleus. Therefore, biochemical fractionation of protoplasts expressing GFP and HA-tagged proteins into nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions was performed. These experiments revealed that 24 hours after transformation approximately 50% of U1A and U1C proteins remained cytoplasmic irrespective of the tag used ( Figure 1B, lanes 5 and 8
nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins RBP45 and fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase (cFBP) indicated that fractionation procedure was specific ( Figure 1B, two bottom panels ). We also compared the expression levels of proteins as this might influence nuclear import. However, analysis of GFP-tagged proteins revealed similar expression levels for all three

Corresponding differential interference contrast (DIC) image of a cell expressing U1-70K is also shown. Arrows, broken arrow and arrowheads point to nuclei, nucleoli and CBs, respectively.

Cell extracts were fractionated as described  [57] . Lanes T, C, and N; total cellular, cytoplasmic, and nuclear protein fractions, respectively. Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting, using mouse anti-GFP and rat anti-HA mAb. Molecular mass standards in kDa are indicated on the left. To control the quality of the fractionation procedure the same blots were probed with antibodies against nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins RBP45  [58]  and fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase (cFBP), respectively (two bottom panels).

co-precipitated with U1A-GFP and U1C-GFP, respectively. U1 snRNP-specific proteins accumulate in Cajal bodies and nucleoli From the images shown in  Figure 1A  it is obvious that the three U1 snRNP-specific proteins show different localisation patterns in the nucleus. As we
and U1C were found in speckles in combination with CB localisation (see  Figure 3C , U1C-GFP) with frequencies less then 1%, whereby the intensity of speckle fluorescence was significantly lower compared to that of U1-70K. 10.1371/journal.pone.0003989.g003 Figure 3 Nuclear distribution of transiently expressed U1-70K, U1A, and U1C proteins.

maturation. Furthermore, it is obvious that higher proportion of U1-70K accumulates in speckles compared to CBs and nucleoli, whereas U1A and U1C are most abundant in these two nuclear compartments and are rarely found in speckles. Co-localisation studies with FP-tagged U1 snRNP proteins Having established that transiently expressed U1 snRNP-specific proteins assemble correctly into mature snRNP, we asked next
observed that U1-70K and U1A/U1C proteins showed strikingly different nuclear localisation patterns. As U1A and U1C showed the same frequencies for all nuclear localisation patterns observed we first asked whether they co-localise in  Arabidopsis  protoplasts. Cells co-expressing U1C-mRFP and U1A-GFP showed perfect co-localisation of proteins in CBs, nucleoli, and nucleoplasm ( Figure 5A ). In addition, co-expression of U1A-GFP and
MATERIALS AND METHODS:
Materials and Methods Plasmids Plasmids expressing U1 70K-GFP, U1-70K-HA, U2B″-mRFP and SRp34-GFP have been described  [34] . Plasmids expressing U1A-GFP, U1A-HA, U1C-HA U11-35K-GFP and U11-35K-RFP have been described  [43] . To generate plant expression plasmids encoding GFP and mRFP tagged U1C protein, the coding region of U1C was amplified by using oligonucleotides: U1C 5′ primer  GATCG GTCGAC AATAAACC ATGCCGAGGTATTACTGTG  and 3′ primer  AGCAT GGATCC TTTCTTGGCATACGTGATG , which introduce a  Sal I (bold) site and
in front of the ATG codon and a  Bam HI site in place of the stop codon, respectively. The PCR products were cut with  Sal I and  Bam HI and ligated into the plant expression vectors pDEDH-GFP and pDEDH-mRFP  [34]
laser at 476 and 568 nm, respectively. GFP was detected at 510 nm to 550 nm, and RFP and mRFP were detected at 630 nm to 680 nm. Images were exported to Adobe Photoshop software and prepared for presentation. SDS-PAGE and Western blotting 12% SDS-PAGE was done according to standard procedure. Proteins were transferred onto PVDF membrane (Millipore) and Western blotting was performed according to standard procedure. Rat anti-HA (3F10, Roche) and mouse anti-GFP (Roche) monoclonal antibodies were used at 1∶1,000 dilution. Mouse anti-RBP45  [58]  monoclonal and rabbit anti-cFBP (Agrisera) polyclonal antibodies were used at 1∶200 and 1∶5,000 dilutions, respectively.
