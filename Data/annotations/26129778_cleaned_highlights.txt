ABSTRACT:
RESULTS:
identified so far are nuclear proteins and SCL15 was shown to be mainly nuclear localized 31 . To confirm the nuclear localization of SCL15, a transient expression assay was conducted in tobacco epidermal cells with a soluble-modified red-shifted green fluorescent protein (smRS-GFP) translational fusion. The SCL15-smRS-GFP was localized only in the nuclei ( Supplementary Fig. 3 ), indicating that SCL15 is a nuclear-restricted GRAS protein. SCL15 physically associates with HDA19 To corroborate the physical association between SCL15 and HDA19 detected in the yeast two-hybrid system,
HDA19 was fused to the C-terminal YFP fragment. A yellow fluorescent signal was observed when SCL15-N-YFP was co-delivered into protoplasts with HDA19-C-YFP ( Fig. 1b  and  Supplementary Fig. 4 ). Third, a co-IP experiment was performed using nuclear protein extracts from roots of T3 homozygous  SCL15pro::SCL15-sGFP  transgenic plants that were in an  scl15-1  background and had been used for the complementation assays. This assay showed that HDA19 co-precipitated with SCL15-sGFP ( Fig. 1c ). These results provide good evidence that SCL15 physically interacts with HDA19 in the nuclei of  Arabidopsis  cells. To test whether SCL15–HDA19 interaction affects the histone acetylation status at a target promoter, a 
sheath (BS) cells ( Fig. 4a,b ). At the root tip, SCL15-sGFP fluorescence was predominantly localized in protophloem sieve elements and neighbouring phloem-pole pericycle cells (Pp;  Fig. 4c,d ). In mature roots, the signal was restricted to the nuclei of metaphloem CCs and the Pp cells ( Fig. 4e,f ). In developing seeds,  SCL15pro::SCL15-sGFP  was expressed in the CCs of chalazal ends of the ovule funiculi, a tissue that connects the ovule to the ovary wall.
MATERIALS AND METHODS:
mature (10 DPA) and post-mature (16 DPA) stages of embryo development. Seeds were completely dried after 17 DPA. To grow plants on solid medium, surface-sterilized seeds were kept for 2 days at 4 °C in the dark, placed onto 1/2 MS medium containing 0.7% agar and 1% sucrose, and grown at 22 °C under continuous light. Tobacco ( Nicotiana
and sugar, 14-day-old seedlings were incubated in liquid half-strength MS medium supplemented with various concentrations of hormones or sucrose for 1 h. Mock (control) treatment consisted of no or 0.1% ethanol, as the IAA (I2886; Sigma-Aldrich) and GA 3  (G7645; Sigma-Aldrich) were dissolved in water and 0.1% ethanol, respectively.
loading buffer and analysed by 12% SDS–PAGE. After electrophoresis, the gels were dried and subjected to fluorography. Full scans of the fluorographic films are provided in  Supplementary Fig. 9 . BiFC assays DNA sequences for the N-terminal 173-amino-acid EYFP (N-YFP) and C-terminal 64-amino-acid (C-YFP) fragments were amplified previously by PCR and cloned into the plant expression vectors pOCA30 and pFGC5941 to generate pOCA-N-YFP and pFGC-C-YFP, respectively 51 . N-YFP was also cloned into pFGC5941 to generate a second N-YFP fusion/expression vector (pFGC-N-YFP).  WRKY38 -coding sequence was amplified using primers WRKY38-f1 and WRKY38-r2, digested with  Sac I/ Spe I and ligated into the  Sac I- Xba I sites of pOCA-N-YFP to generate an in-frame fusion with N-YFP. The  HDA19 -coding sequence was amplified using primers HDA19-f2 and HDA19-r3, digested with  Spe I and  Bg lII and ligated into the  Xba I- Bam HI sites of pFGC-C-YFP to form an in-frame fusion with C-YFP. For generating the SCL15-N-YFP fusion construct, the ∼600 bp 5′ and ∼900 bp 3′ coding sequences of SCL15 were amplified using two pairs of primers scl-f6/scl-r6 and scl-f7/scl-r7, digested with  Sac I/ Bam HI and  Bam HI/ Xba I, respectively, and sequentially cloned into the same sites of pFGC-N-YFP.  WRKY38  was sub-cloned in the same way as  SCL15  and was used as a positive control for interaction with HDA19 (ref.  51 ). The plasmids were used for BiFC assays as previously described 52
Z1 microscope with ApoTome and AxioCam MRm (Carl Zeiss). The experiments were performed three times with the same results. Extraction of nuclear proteins and co-IP assays Nuclei and nuclear proteins were isolated from roots of 2-week-old Col-0 and  SCL15pro::SCL15-sGFP  (Compl-6) seedlings as previously described 53 . Briefly, root powder was homogenized in cold Buffer A (0.4 M sucrose, 10 mM HEPES, 2.5 mM dithiothreitol, 2 mM EDTA, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 protease inhibitor cocktail tablet (Roche Diagnostics) per 50 ml buffer, pH
dilution of 1:200 following the manufacturer's instructions and then incubated with the pre-cleared nuclear protein extract by rotating for 30 min at 4 °C. The immobilized proteins on the GFP-coupled beads were washed four times and subsequently eluted for immunoblotting using anti-HDA19 antibodies 54  at a dilution of 1:2,000 and HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Invitrogen, Catalogue No. 65–6120) as the secondary antibody at 1:30,000 dilution. The Clarity Western
at least three biological replicates. Plasmid construction For subcellular protein localization, the construct  35Spro::smRS-GFP  was generated in the binary vector  pCAMBIA 57  by subcloning the cDNA (U70496) that encodes the smRS-GFP 58 . The  SCL15  open reading frame was amplified by PCR and subcloned into the  EcoR I- Sac II sites of the plasmid  35Spro::smRS-GFP  in-frame with the N-terminus of smRS-GFP generating  35Spro::SCL15-smRS-GFP . Plasmid  35Spro::smRS-GFP  was used as the negative control for transient expression in  Nicotiana tabacum  epidermal cells 59 . For promoter expression studies, 2,353 bp of the  SCL15  promoter including 299 bp of 5′ untranslated region was amplified using
complementation of the  scl15  mutant, the  SCL15  gene sequence (including 2,051 bp of promoter, the 5′ untranslated region and 1,458 bp of coding region without the TAG stop codon) was synthesized in frame with 717 bp of  sGFP  by GeneArt Gene Synthesis (Life Technologies, Canada), in which a ten-residue flexible polypeptide linker (GGGGSGGGGS) was inserted before  sGFP , and cloned into a modified  pZP121  binary vector 57 . The resulting  SCL15pro::SCL15-sGFP  construct was used to transform homozygous  scl15-1  mutant plants. Multiple independent transgenic lines that displayed a 3:1 segregation ratio in T2 populations were selected. The T3 homozygous lines Compl-6 and Compl-8 were chosen for the complementation assays. Histochemical and microscopic analysis For subcellular localization of the SCL15:smRS-GFP fusion, transiently transformed  N. tabacum  leaves were incubated with 50 μg ml −1  4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; Life Technologies) for nuclei staining. Leaf tissues were stained with DAPI for 30 min. GFP signal was observed on a Zeiss Axio Imager Z1 microscope with ApoTome and AxioCam MRm and AxioVision Rel. 4.7 Imaging System (Carl Zeiss) with excitation of 490 and 383 nm for GFP and DAPI, respectively. The images shown are representative of at least three independent experiments. For  SCL15pro::GUS  activity assay, whole  Arabidopsis  seedlings or individual organs were incubated with GUS staining solution (10 mM phosphate buffer, 10 mM EDTA,
GUS staining was performed as described by Sieburth and Meyerowitz 61 . Images were captured using an Axioplan Universal microscope with a Digital CCD camera and AxioCam ICc 1 and AxioVision Release 4.7 software. For anatomical analysis of  SCL15pro::SCL15-sGFP  plants, whole seedlings were stained briefly with 10 μg ml −1  propidium iodide (Sigma-Aldrich), mounted in water under glass coverslips, and visualized on a Zeiss Axio Imager Z1 microscope with ApoTome and AxioCam MRm software. The excitation wavelengths for GFP and propidium iodide were 561 nm and 488 nm, respectively. Microarray and data analysis Wild-type Col-0 and  scl15-1  seeds were sterilized and sown onto 1/2 MS agar-sucrose plates. Total RNA was isolated from 14-day-old seedlings using the RNeasy Plant mini kit (Qiagen). An  Arabidopsis  70-mer oligo-gene array containing 26,090 annotated genes was used for
