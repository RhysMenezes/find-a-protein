ABSTRACT:
proteome of aging Arabidopsis leaves. We found that its composition is highly different from that of seed/cotyledon and identified 28 proteins including 9 enzymes of the secondary metabolism pathways involved in plant defense response. With the exception of the TRIGALACTOSYLDIACYLGLYCEROL2 protein, we did not identify enzymes implicated in lipid metabolism, suggesting that growth of leaf LDs does not occur by local lipid synthesis but rather through contact sites with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) or other membranes. The two most abundant proteins of the leaf LDs are the CALEOSIN3 and the SMALL RUBBER PARTICLE1 (AtSRP1); both proteins have structural functions and participate in plant response to stress. CALEOSIN3 and AtSRP1 are part of larger protein families, yet no other members were enriched in the LD proteome suggesting a specific role of both

co-exist in cotyledons and mature leaves Next, we assayed the localization of fluorescent AtSRP1 constructs using confocal laser scanning microscopy. In agreement with Gidda et al. ( 2016 ) and Kim et al. ( 2016 ), AtSRP1-TagRFP co-localized with cytosolic mobile particles stained with the neutral lipid-specific fluorescent dye BODIPY 493/503 , suggesting that AtSRP1 localizes to lipid rich bodies (Figure  2C ). A similar localization was observed with AtSRP1 constructs fused to YFP or TagRFP either at
round-shaped cytosolic aggregates, which were never observed in wild-type leaves (Figure  5A2 ). To confirm the nature of these clusters, immunogold labeling with an antibody specific to the GFP/YFP protein was performed on cryo-fixed roots of a  YFP-AtSRP1  overexpressing line. Labeling was restricted to these cytosolic aggregates (Figure  S7 ), while no such specific labeling was observed in control experiments where anti-GFP/YFP antibody was omitted. Therefore, our data indicate that the YFP-AtSRP1 protein is specifically associated with these aggregates. These structures were not surrounded by a typical bilayer membrane but a monolayer (insert Figure  5A2 ), suggesting that they are not vesicles or small vacuoles. Similar clusters homogeneously stained by osmium tetroxide were observed in chemically fixed leaves of  YFP-AtSRP1  overexpressing lines (Figure  5A3 ). The colocalization of AtSRP1-TagRFP protein with the neutral lipid specific dye BODIPY 493/503  (Figure 
observed in the close vicinity of the ER membranes (Figures  5A2,A3 ). In order to obtain a better vision of the position of LDs in the ER network,  N. benthamiana  leaves were transiently co-transformed with  pUB10::AtSRP1-YFP  and a fluorescent marker of the ER, HDEL-mCherry (Nelson et al.,  2007 ). As shown in Figure  6A , the transient expression of  AtSRP1  in tobacco leaves was sufficient to induce the formation of LD clusters similar to that observed in stably transformed Arabidopsis. These LD clusters were mobile, likely following cytosolic or ER streaming (Ueda et al.,  2010 ). YFP tagged LD clusters appeared not only in contact to mCherry fluorescent ER membranes, but even trapped in the ER network, showing a multitude of contact sites between LDs and ER membranes (Figure  6A  and Movie  S1 ). Unfortunately, the confocal microscopy resolution is not sufficient to resolve
of LDs in  AtSRP1  overexpressing lines rather suggests that LDs are formed at restricted, specialized areas of the ER.

N. benthamiana  leaves were transiently co-transformed with AtSRP1-YFP and HDEL-mCherry constructs labeling LDs and ER membranes respectively. Deconvolution after confocal imaging of epidermal cells demonstrates multiple contact sites between LDs and the ER network, and AtSRP1-YFP localization at the LD periphery.

MATERIALS AND METHODS:
For lipid analysis, seeds were first germinated on half strength MS medium, and then transplanted in individual pots in growth chamber in long day conditions, at 20–22°C and 40% humidity. The  atsrp1_1  (SALK_148081) and  atsrp1_2  (GK-309G05) T-DNA mutants were obtained from the ABRC seed stock center,
without the stop codon were subsequently transferred by GATEWAY® recombinational cloning technology in diverse destination vectors under the 35S promoter in pGWB661 and pGWB660 (Nakamura et al.,  2010 ), and under the  UBQ10  promoter in  pUBNYFP  or  pUBCYFP  (Grefen et al.,  2010 ) to obtain  TagRFP-AtSRP1, AtSRP1-TagRFP, YFP-AtSRP1 , and  AtSRP1-YFP  constructs respectively. The resulting plasmids were introduced into Arabidopsis plants by an Agrobacterium transfection method (Clough and Bent,  1998 ). Two or three confirmed lines, numbered #a to c, were used for the different experiments. Sequences of
and concentrated by chloroforme-methanol precipitation (Wessel and Flugge,  1984 ). For immunoblot experiments, proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE (Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate—PolyAcrylamide Gel Electrophoresis) and blotted onto nitrocellulose membrane for immunodetection. Blots were probed with an antibody raised against GFP (Roche), or sera raised against plastoglobule, ER, Golgi or thylakoid markers, respectively AtFBN1b (Vidi et al.,  2006 ), BiP (Höfte and Chrispeels,  1992 ), AtMemb11 (Marais et al.,  2015 ), or P16 (Vallon et al., 
kit manual (Sigma). Label-free quantitative data analysis Proteins were identified by mass spectrometry and relatively quantified by a label-free approach (for detailed description see Appendix  S1 ). Ten microgram of each fraction were loaded onto a 10% acrylamide SDS-gel. Trypsin digested peptide mixture was analyzed on a Ultimate 3000 nanoLC system (Dionex, Amsterdam, The Netherlands) coupled to a LTQ-Orbitrap XL mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, San Jose, USA). Data were searched by SEQUEST through Proteome Discoverer 1.4 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, San Jose, USA) against the TAIR (The Arabidopsis Information Resource) protein database. Raw LC-MS/MS data were imported in Progenesis QI 2.0 (Nonlinear Dynamics Ltd, Newcastle, UK). Protein abundance was calculated according to
relative normalized abundances were calculated based on the triplicates of the enrichment ratios between LD and each of the other fractions calculated for each protein. Quantitative data were considered for proteins quantified by a minimum of 2 peptides. The mass spectrometry proteomics data have been deposited to the ProteomeXchange Consortium via the PRIDE (Vizcaíno
Alltech Associates, Deerfield, IL, USA) coupled to a flame ionization detector (GC-FID). Confocal microscopy and BODIPY 493/503  coloration Observations were performed on a confocal microscope Leica TCS SP2. When needed, leaf tissues were stained with a neutral lipid-specific fluorescent dye, BODIPY 493/503  (MolecularProbes), at a final concentration of 1 μg/mL for 5 min in the dark. The acquisitions with objective X63 were taken sequentially on each channel with the following acquisition settings: excitation wavelength of 514 nm and emission of 520–550 nm band pass for YFP, excitation wavelength of 543 nm and emission of 600–650 nm band pass for TagRFP, excitation wavelength of 514 nm and emission filter of 520–540 nm band pass for BODIPY 493/503 , excitation wavelength of 514 nm and emission of 655–690 nm or 695–750 nm band pass for chlorophyll autofluorescence. Stack image deconvolution was
performed. To finish, the samples were polymerized at 70°C for 16 h. Cryofixation was performed on the first leaves of 6-day-old plants. The samples were high pressure frozen (HPF) with an EM-PACT1 (Leica) device and 20% BSA in half MS medium was used as cryoprotectant. Freeze-substitution steps were achieved in an AFS2 (Leica) system. Samples were first incubated at −90°C into a glutaraldehyde 0.5%, osmium tetroxide 2%, uranyl acetate 0.1% in
IEM was made according to Grison et al. ( 2015 ). GFP antibodies (Tp401, Torrey Pines Biolabs) were diluted 1/500 before immuno-gold-labeling with anti-rabbit conjugated with 5 nm colloidal gold (Tebu) diluted 1/30.
