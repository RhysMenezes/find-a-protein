ABSTRACT:
RESULTS:
showed that ZHD5 is a transcriptional activator, suggesting that it is a nuclear protein. It was therefore hypothesized that the MIF1 protein may also affect the subcellular localization of ZHD5. We examined the subcellular localization of ZHD5 using a ZHD5-GFP fusion protein in  Arabidopsis  protoplasts. The ZHD5-GFP protein was localized predominantly into the nucleus ( Fig. 4 A ). Nuclear localization of the ZHD5-GFP protein was also confirmed by transient expression in onion epidermal cells and DAPI staining ( supplemental Fig. S7 ). We next determined the subcellular localization of MIF1. A  MIF1-RFP  gene fusion was expressed
the cytoplasm ( Fig. 4 B ), although the identity of the small vesicle-like structures is unknown ( 49 ). Weak GFP signal was also detected in the nuclei of a few cells examined ( supplemental Fig. S7 ). FIGURE 4. Modulation of the subcellular localization of ZHD5 by MIF1 in  Arabidopsis  protoplasts.
