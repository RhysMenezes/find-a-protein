MATERIALS AND METHODS:
for 16 h days and low-light conditions of 40 μE for 16 h days were provided by a mixture of fluorescent and incandescent lamps or fluorescent lamps only. Promoter analysis General conditions have been described (Styer et al.,  2004 ). WT, MIOX2p:GUS, and MIOX4p:GUS seeds were surface-sterilized, grown on soil or on no nutrients (agar), low nutrients (agar + 0.5× MS salts), and optimal nutrients (agar + 0.5× MS salts + 3% glucose). Seedlings were removed at 5–7 days from the plates and GUS stained. Stained samples were photographed with an Olympus SZX16 stereoscope and attached Olympus DP71 camera with DP Controller software (Olympus Corp., Japan). Mutant isolation Potential MIOX2 (At2g19800)
(Aglient Technologies, Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA). The mass spectrum for each peak of interest was compared with a library, from Agilent Data Analysis software, of known spectral data for compound identification (Aglient Technologies, Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA). SIM mode detected inositol target ions at a mass:charge ratio of 217, 305, and 432, and DGlcA ions at 204, 217, and 305, respectively. Western blotting Conditions have been previously reported (Burnette et al.,  2003 ). Briefly, tissues were
gel for separation. SDS-PAGE was followed by Western blotting with a 1:20000 dilution of rabbit anti-MIOX4 antibody (provided by the Nessler lab from Cocalico Biologicals, Inc., Reamstown, PA, USA) or blotting with a 1:1000 dilution of rabbit anti- green fluorescent protein (GFP) antibody (Invitrogen Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR, USA). A secondary goat, anti-rabbit horse radish peroxidase antibody (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA) was used at a 1:2000
