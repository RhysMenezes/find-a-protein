ABSTRACT:
one of PP2Cs clade A in  Arabidopsis thaliana . Transgenic plants containing pHAI-1::GUS (β-glucuronidase) displayed GUS activity existing in the vascular system of leave veins, stems and petioles. Green fluorescent protein fused HAI-1 (HAI-1-GFP) was found in the nucleus through transient

Each shot contains 270 μg gold particles (1.0 μm in diameter), and particles were coated with 2 μl of p35S:HAI-1-GFP recombinant plasmid at 0.5 μg/μl. The gold-coated DNA particles were delivered into onion epidermal cells using the PDS-1000/He biolistic particle delivery system (BioRad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA), and the bombarded onion epidermal peels were maintained at 25 °C for at least
