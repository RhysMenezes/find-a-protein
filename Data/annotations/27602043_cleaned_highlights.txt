ABSTRACT:
RESULTS:
UGT76C2 is one of the core CK homeostasis genes, we examined its subcellular localization using confocal laser scanning microscopy using GFP tagging. As shown in  Figure  9B , the fluorescent pattern of UGT76C2-GFP displayed diffuse fluorescence in cytosol, accumulating along the plasma membrane and in nuclei ( Grebenok et al., 1997a , b ;  Köhler et al., 1997 ;  Figure  9A ), thus proving UGT76C2 to be a cytosolic
MATERIALS AND METHODS:
 (SALK 085809C), and  ugt85a1-2  (SALK 146306C) were obtained from the European  Arabidopsis  Stock Center (for the description of the lines see Supplementary Table  S1 ). Surface sterilized seeds were sown on half strength MS medium ( Murashige and Skoog,
detached for experiments with exogenously applied CK and further for gene expression profiling. The leaves were incubated in water containing 10 μM KIN, 6-benzylaminopurine (BAP), isopentenyladenine (iP) or  trans -zeatin ( t Z) with final concentration of dimethylsulfoxid (DMSO) 0.05% for 3 days under the
10 μM solution of  t Z containing 0.005% surfactant Silweet L-77 every 24 h for 3 days. In both cases, mock treatment contained 0.05% DMSO.  Solanum lycopersicum  L., Peto 343 was used for overexpression of  SU:UGT76C2-GFP  for the subcellular localization study described below. Identification of T-DNA Insertion Mutants Although  UGT85A1  mutant was described before, its expression was not abolished completely ( Carviel et al., 2009 ). In this work, we characterize a
work based on their gene expression quantification (Supplementary Figure  S2 ). Phenotyping and Root Growth Assay Sterilized seeds of  Arabidopsis  wild-type (WT) and  ugt85A1-1  were transferred to vertical square Petri dishes on a solid MS medium containing 0.5% MES and 1% sucrose as well as various concentrations of BAP, iP, dihydrozeatin (DHZ) and  t Z, respectively. 0.05% DMSO was used in control (mock treatment) since that was the final concentration in all CK treatments. After stratification, the seeds were germinated and grown in an environmental chamber for 14 days. Within the growing period the length of the

The samples were analyzed employing ultra-high performance liquid chromatography (Acquity UPLC system; Waters), coupled to a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (Xevo TQ-S; Waters) equipped with an electrospray interface. Deuterium-labeled CK internal standards (OlChemIm) were used to validate the determination, each at 0.5 pmol per sample ( Novák et al., 2008 ). Quantification was achieved by multiple reaction monitoring of [M + H] +  and the appropriate product ion. The quantification was performed by Masslynx software (v4.1; Waters) using a standard isotope dilution method. The ratio of endogenous CK to the appropriate labeled standard was determined and further used to quantify the level of endogenous compounds in the original extract according to the known
2 -ΔCq  extrapolated to controls that are given as 1.0. To confirm UGT85A1 expression level of  ugt85a1  mutants, 85A1fw and 85A1rev primers were used ( Carviel et al., 2009 ) in RT-PCR. Cloning and Generation of GFP Translational Fusions A Modular Binary Construct System with AKK1436 as a shuttle vector and AKK1472B binary vector (Christopher Taylor Lab, Donald Danforth Plant Science Center, St. Louis, MO, USA) was used for GFP gene fusion and subsequent overexpression of the GFP tagged  UGT76C2  gene in tomato hairy roots under a super ubiquitin ( SU ) promoter as described in our previous work ( Šmehilová et al., 2009 ). The gene for UGT76C2 was synthetized using GeneArt ®
