ABSTRACT:
strategies facilitating these processes is therefore necessary. Results Here, we evaluated plastoglobule lipoprotein particles as a new subchloroplastic destination for recombinant proteins. The yellow fluorescent protein as a trackable cargo was targeted to plastoglobules when fused to plastoglobulin 34 (PGL34) as the carrier. Similar to adipocyte differentiation related protein (ADRP) in animal cells, most of the protein sequence of PGL34 was necessary for targeting to lipid bodies. The recombinant protein was efficiently enriched in plastoglobules isolated by simple flotation centrifugation. The viability of plants overproducing the recombinant protein was not affected, indicating that plastoglobule targeting did not significantly impair
RESULTS:
Results Sequence requirement for targeting of PGL34-GFP to plastoglobules In the absence of data on the sequence requirement for plastoglobule targeting, we designed a series of C-terminal GFP fusion constructs that removed portions of  PGL34  coding sequence (Fig.  2A ). PGL34 is a representative member
3E ). Punctate signals were observed in epidermal as well as in mesophyll cells. YFP patterns were similar to those observed in protoplasts transiently expressing  PGL34-YFP  (Fig.  3B ), indicating targeting of the YFP cargo to plastoglobules  in planta . Phenotype of plants accumulating PGL34-YFP Transgenic plants accumulating PGL34-YFP were indistinguishable from the wild-type when grown in short or long-day conditions (Fig.  4A ). The germination rate of transgenic seeds was equal to wild
anti-PGL35 (At4g04020), anti-TOC75 (At3g46740) and anti-CAB (chlorophyll a/b binding protein) antibodies as plastoglobule, envelope and thylakoid markers, respectively. The results demonstrated the separation of plastoglobules (fractions 1–7) from envelope (in fractions 11–15) and thylakoid membranes (predominantly in fractions 11–21). PGL34-YFP, detected by anti-GFP antibodies, co-distributed with PGL35. Moreover, globular fluorescent structures were highly abundant in low-density fractions (Fig.  5C ), demonstrating targeting of the recombinant protein to plastoglobules. SDS-PAGE analysis of the low-density fractions revealed a prominent band with an apparent mass of 55 kDa consistent with the predicted mass of PGL34-YFP (28.3, processed PGL34 + 26.9, YFP). This band was recognized by anti-GFP antibodies (Fig 
MATERIALS AND METHODS:
TTG TAT TCA AGA TTC TCT ACA AC-3') primers included  Nco I sites. The PCR product was ligated in the  Nco I site of either pCL60 [ 40 ] or pCL62 [ 14 ], resulting in C-terminal GFP or CFP fusions respectively, under the control of the CaMV 35S promoter and the nos terminator. Partial  PGL34  sequences were amplified from pCL60-PGL34 using a forward primer containing a  Xba I site (5'-gct cta gaA TGG CAT TGA
1–170 ), 5'-cat gcc atg gcT TCC ACC CTC GTT AGA AC-3' (PGL34 1–290 ). The corresponding PCR products were ligated into the  Xba I and  Nco I sites of pCL60 or pCL61 [ 14 ], yielding GFP and YFP fusions, respectively. To obtain the deletion construct pCL60-PGL34 1–56..134–308 , a C-terminal fragment of  PGL34  was amplified from pCL60-PGL34 using forward (5'-cat gcc atg gcc TTT GAG TGG TTT GGA GTC AAC-3') and reverse (5'-cat gcc atg
GAA CAA GAG TT-3' and reverse 5'-CAT GCC ATG GCA CTG TTG TAT TCA AGA TTC TCT ACA AC-3' primers and inserted in the  Nco I site of the pCL61 vector, in frame with the coding sequence of YFP. PGL34 3' downstream region (0.47 kb, including the terminator) was amplified by PCR from genomic DNA using forward 5'-CCG CGG CCG CAA ACA GGT TCT CTT GTT ACT CTG ATT C-3' and reverse 5'-GGG CGG CCG GAG ATC TCG GTC TCT CAA AGG ATG TG-3' primers. The fragment was cloned in the  Not I site of pCL61. PGL34 and YFP sequences were excised from pCL61 by restriction digest with  Aat II and  Kpn I. Fragments were blunted and ligated in the  Sma I site of pCAMBIA3300 binary vector (CAMBIA), yielding pCAMBIA3300:PGL34-YFP. Transient and stable A. thaliana transformation Transient transformation of protoplasts was done using the polyethylene glycol method as described in ref. [ 41 ], but reducing cellulase and macerozyme (Serva) concentrations to 1% and 0.25% (w/v) respectively. Fluorescence in transformed protoplasts was monitored 48 h after transformation by confocal laser scanning microscopy. GFP was detected using the FITC (488 nm) laser line from a LEICA TCS 4D microscope (LEICA Microsystems). For double fluorescent experiments, CFP and YFP were detected sequentially with a LEICA SP2 AOBS microscope, using 458 and 514 nm laser lines and 460–510 nm and 520–588 nm detection windows, respectively. Chlorophyll autofluorescence was monitored using either 594 nm or TRITC (568 nm) excitation wavelengths. Stable transformation of  A. thaliana  plants with pCAMBIA3300:PGL34-YFP was carried out using the floral dip method as described [ 42 , 43 ]. Transformants were selected on plates containing phosphinothricin. Protein extraction and immunoblot analysis Proteins were isolated from Arabidopsis leaves according to ref. [ 44 ].
proteins were concentrated by chloroform – methanol precipitation [ 45 ], separated by SDS-PAGE and blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes. Proteins were stained with amidoblack (= naphthol blue black) for protein detection or used for immunodetection. Blots were probed with anti-GFP (gift from Dr. E. Schäfer) and anti-CAB (kindly provided by Dr. K. Apel) sera, or with affinity-purified antibodies specific for TOC75 [ 46 ] and PGL35 [ 14 ]. For quantification, chemiluminescent immunoblot signals were analysed using a Bio-Rad
