ABSTRACT:
120 chemical structures. In our previous work, soluble proteins and metabolites in Arabidopsis mutants deficient of aliphatic ( myb28/29 ) and indolic Gls ( cyp79B2B3 ) were analyzed. Here we focus on investigating the changes at the level of membrane proteins in these mutants. Our LC/MS-MS analyses of tandem mass tag (TMT) labeled peptides derived from the  cyp79B2/B3  and  myb28/29  relative to wild type resulted in the identification of 4,673 proteins, from which 2,171 are membrane proteins. Fold changes and statistical analysis showed 64 increased and 74 decreased in  cyp79B2/B3 , while 28 increased and 17 decreased in  myb28/29 . As to the shared protein changes between the mutants, one protein was increased
RESULTS:
Results cyp79B2/B3  and  myb28/29  membrane proteomes Based on the MS/MS spectra of high confidence peptides derived from the WT,  cyp79B2/B3  and  myb28/29 , we identified 4673 proteins in two independent experiments using Proteome Discover (Supplementary Table  2 ). Out of

MATERIALS AND METHODS:
 m/z , and 445.12003  m/z  (polysiloxane ion mass) was used for real-time mass calibration. Protein identification and quantification The MS data were searched using Proteome Discoverer 1.4 (Thermo Scientific, Bremen, Germany) against the  Arabidopsis  TAIR10 database with 35,386 entries. The searching parameters were set to 300 and 5,000 Da as minimum and maximum precursor mass filters, digestion with trypsin with two missed cleavages, Carbamidomethylation of cysteine was set as a static modification, and TMT6plex of N terminus, TMT6plex of lysine, phosphorylation of STY (serine, threonine, and tyrosine) and methionine oxidation were set as dynamic modifications. Precursor mass tolerance was 10 ppm, fragment mass tolerance was 0.01 Da, spectrum grouping maximum retention time difference was 1.1 and false discovery rate was 0.01 at
