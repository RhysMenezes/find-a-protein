ABSTRACT:
RESULTS:
dynamic partitioning during the immune response potentially mediated by subcellular re-localization. We investigated GAPC1 localization by confocal microscopy using the  npro :: GAPC1-GFP  line 3–4. Plasmolysis using 1M NaCl revealed GAPC1-GFP localized to Hechtian strands, indicating partial plasma membrane localization (Fig  6A ,  6B , and  6C ). Western blotting after membrane fractionation in wild-type Col-0 using α-GAPDH shows endogenous GAPDH is present in nuclear, cytoplasmic and membrane fractions ( S6 Fig ). Thus, GAPC1 exhibits diverse subcellular localizations in the absence of stress conditions. 10.1371/journal.pgen.1005199.g006 Fig 6 GAPC1-GFP localizes to intracellular membranes and localization is altered by endosomal trafficking inhibitors. Confocal micrographs of the  gapc1  KO complemented with  npro :: GAPC1-GFP  (line 3–4) show optical sections of three-week-old leaves.  (A- C)  Plasmolysis using 1 M NaCl demonstrates that GAPC1-GFP is localized to Hechtian strands, providing evidence of plasma membrane localization. Arrow indicates Hechtian strand, and dotted line marks the cell boundary.

treated with 33 μM Wortmannin (Wm) have an increased size of GAPC1-GFP fluorescent puncta relative to water treatment. Inset shows enlarged representative fluorescent puncta. Bar = 10 μm. In order to further probe the relationship between GAPC1 and cellular membranes, we treated the first true leaves of three-week-old plants grown in soil with either 30μM Brefeldin A (BFA) or 33μM Wortmannin and
BFA bodies stained with FM4-64 co-localized with GAPC1-GFP, indicating that GAPC1-GFP localization is BFA-sensitive (Fig  6D ,  6E , and  6F ). FM4-64 is an amphiphilic styryl dye that fluoresces in hydrophobic environments such as lipid membranes and is commonly used as an endocytic marker [ 53
visualized in either plants or animals. In the Wortmannin treated seedlings, an increase in the size of endosomes occurred (Fig  6G  and  6H ). These data indicate that GAPC1-GFP localization is sensitive to the inhibition of Golgi-mediated and late endocytic trafficking pathways. Furthermore, these results highlight the diverse sub-cellular localization of GAPC1. Flg22 treatment induces an increase in the size of GAPC1-GFP florescent puncta During the plant innate immune response, several proteins dynamically re-localize to different
was found to induce a significant increase in puncta area (p< 0.01). Arabidopsis GAPC1 and animal GAPDH have also been described as dynamically re-localizing to the nucleus in response to cellular stress [ 32 , 58 ]. Quantification of fluorescently-labeled nuclei from confocal z-stack slices revealed an increase in nuclear-localized GAPC1-GFP after flg22 treatment (Fig  7D ,  7E , and  7F ). Isolation of nuclei from seedlings treated with water or 5μM flg22 supports enhanced accumulation of GAPC1-GFP in the nucleus after flg22 treatment ( Fig 7G ). Together, these data indicate a dynamic re-distribution of GAPC1-GFP to the endomembrane system and nucleus during innate immune signaling. 10.1371/journal.pgen.1005199.g007 Fig 7 Treatment with flg22 induces an increase in size of GAPC1-GFP labeled vesicles and enhances GAPC1-GFP nuclear localization. Confocal micrographs of the  gapc1  KO complemented with  npro :: GAPC1-GFP  (line 3–4) show optical sections of leaves from four-week-old plants ±flg22.  (A)  Leaves were infiltrated with a needleless syringe with 10mM
each treatment (n = 10). Statistical differences were detected by a two-tailed Student’s  t  test (α = 0.001). The size of GAPC1-GFP labeled vesicle increases significantly (p< 0.01) at 30 min post-infiltration with flg22.

Statistical differences were detected by a two-tailed Student’s  t  test (α = 0.001).  (G)  Nuclear isolation of  npro :: GAPC1-GFP  seedlings treated 30 min with water or 5μM flg22. Accumulation of GAPC1-GFP in the nuclei of flg22-treated seedlings was detected using α-GFP western blotting.

period of 4–5 days. Monodansylcadaverine (MDC), a fluorescent dye that specifically binds autophagosomes [ 60 , 62 ], was used to visualize autophagy induction by confocal microscopy. Concanamycin A, an inhibitor of vacuolar H+-ATPases, was used to de-acidify the vacuole and allow for visualization of autophagosome accumulation in the vacuole. When grown on full MS media, Col-0 exhibits very few to no autophagy bodies ( Fig 8A ). Interestingly,  gapa1-2  and  gapc1  seedlings grown on full nutrient media exhibited an enhanced accumulation of autophagosomes in the vacuole as compared to

(D-F)  Confocal micrographs of 10 day old Col-0,  gapa1-2 , and  gapc1  KO lines transiently transfected with tRFP-Atg8a to visualize cytosolic autophagosomes. Transiently transfected seedlings all exhibit tRFP-Atg8a labeled autophagosomes, with greater numbers present in  gapa1-2  and  gapc1  KOs. Bar = 10 μm.  (G-H)  Images depicted above were quantified using ImageJ to calculate the
of autophagy-related genes (Atgs) that are highly conserved across eukaryotes [ 63 ]. When autophagy is initiated, the ubiquitin-like Atg8 protein can be used as a marker to label cytosolic autophagosomes [ 60 , 63 ]. Autophagosomes labeled with tRFP-Atg8a were present in the cytoplasm of Col-0,  gapa1-2 , and  gapc1  seedlings (Fig  8D ,  8E , and  8F ). Similar to the
MATERIALS AND METHODS:
Plants were grown in a controlled environmental chamber at 23°C with a 10-h light/14-h dark photoperiod under a light intensity of 85 μE/m 2 /s. For all the experiments, 4–5 week old plants were used. Transgenic  npro :: GAPC1-GFP  lines were generated using the floral dip method [ 85 ], in order to complement the  gapc1  KO. The length of native promoter we used was 811bp, and it was PCR amplified and cloned as an in-frame fusion to genomic  GAPC1  in pENTR (Invitrogen). Next, the  GAPC1  construct was transferred into the binary vector pGWB4 using gateway technology to generate a C-terminal GFP tag [ 86 ]. Transgenic plants were selected on 50μg/mL hygromycin. T3 homozygous lines were used for all experiments. All PCR primers
750nM 2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (H 2 DCFDA, CalBioChem) was added and cells incubated in the dark for 12–15 min. Images used for quantification of  gapa1  and Col-0 ( Fig 5 ) were obtained using a Leica DM 5000B epifluorescent microscope with a GFP cube (excitation 470/40, emission 525/50). All other genotypes were imaged using the Axio Imager M2 microscope (Zeiss, Germany) using a 40X objective (EC Plan-NEOFLUAR 40X/ 0.75, Zeiss). Fluorescence was quantified using ImageJ from a minimum of 25 protoplasts across 10 or more images per genotype. Western blot analysis SDS-PAGE and subsequent immunoblotting were performed according to standard procedures [ 89 ]. GAPC1-GFP immunoblots were performed with Anti-GFP (ab290, Abcam) rabbit polyclonal antibody at a dilution of 1:8,000. Anti-cF6BP immunoblots were performed using rabbit polyclonal antibody at a dilution of 1: 5,000 (Agrisera). Anti-RIN4 immunoblotting used affinity purified antisera from rabbit at 1:3,000. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies anti-Histone
Hydrogen peroxide at specified concentrations was added just prior to the initiation of the assay. Confocal microscopy All confocal microscopy was performed using a Zeiss LSM710 confocal microscope equipped with a LDC-apochromat 40×/1.1W Korr M27 water-immersion objective (NA 1.1). GFP was excited at 488nm, emission collected at 500–550nm for all experiments except MDC treatments. After treatment with 50 μM MDC, GFP emission was collected at 510–560nm. Leaves incubated with 1 μM
night before imaging, 1μM Concanamycin A (Sigma) or equivalent volume of DMSO was added to each well. Three hours before imaging, 50μM MDC was added and plates were wrapped in foil and kept in the dark. Transient expression of 2x35S::tRFP-Atg8a was as previously described [ 91 ], with some modifications. After a four day co-cultivation period with Agrobacterium GV3101 the co-cultivation media was removed and seedlings were washed three times with distilled water. Seedlings were then re-suspended in full
