ABSTRACT:
RESULTS:
106 aa), CFP-AtSUN2ΔCC (deletion of the coiled-coil domain, aa 205–225), CFP-AtSUN2ΔCSUN (deletion of the C-terminal 146 aa of the SUN domain), and GFP-Myc-AtSUN2ΔNSUN (deletion of the N-terminal 84 aa of the SUN domain). As a negative control, the unrelated GFP-NLS-GFP–nuclear export signal (NES) fusion protein was used. After IP using an anti-GFP antibody, coimmunoprecipitated Myc-SINE1 was detected by an anti-Myc antibody. As
GFP-SINE2ΔLVPT, GFP-SINE3ΔPLPT, GFP-SINE4ΔLVPT, and GFP-SINE5ΔLVPT, they were stably expressed in  A. thaliana  under the control of the 35S promoter.  Fig. 2 B  shows that all five GFP fusion proteins were only weakly associated with the nuclear periphery and were abundantly
NE Protein interactions will reduce the mobility of a membrane protein, and FRAP can assay this mobility difference ( Reits and Neefjes, 2001 ). By expressing proteins in  N. benthamiana  leaves, the mobility at the NE of GFP-SINE1 and GFP-SINE2 with or without coexpression of AtSUN proteins
the fibers (arrowheads) are still visible in the mock treatment. The images of guard cells are maximum intensity projections of a z-stack image. The differentiated root cell nuclei were imaged at the nuclear surface. (C) FRAP recovery curves of GFP-SINE1 with or without LatB-triggered F-actin depolymerization.  A. thaliana  lines stably transformed with GFP-SINE1 driven by the 35S promoter were used for FRAP. The asterisk indicates a significant statistical difference of
MATERIALS AND METHODS:
was obtained from GABI-Kat. The primers used for genotyping are listed in  Table S2 . Genotyping of the  qrt1-2  allele in  sine2-1  was performed as reported by  Francis et al. (2006) . Constructs CFP-AtSUN2 ,  CFP-AtSUN2ΔN ,  CFP-AtSUN2ΔCC , and  CFP-AtSUN2ΔCSUN  were described by  Graumann et al. (2010) . In brief, coding sequences of  AtSUN2 ,  AtSUN2ΔN ,  AtSUN2ΔCC , and  AtSUN2ΔCSUN  were amplified by PCR and cloned into the pDONR207 vector. After confirmation by sequencing, they were moved to pB7WGC2 ( Karimi et al., 2002 ) by LR reaction (Invitrogen) to obtain the CFP-fused constructs.  Myc-Flag-AtSUN1 ,  Myc-AtSUN2 ,  GFP-Myc-AtSUN2ΔNSUN ,  RFP-Flag-AtSUN1 ,  RFP-Flag-AtSUN1ΔNSUN ,  RFP-Myc-AtSUN2 , and  RFP-Myc-AtSUN2ΔNSUN  were described previously ( Zhou et al., 2012a ). In brief, coding sequences of  Flag-AtSUN1 ,  Myc-AtSUN2 ,  Flag-AtSUN1ΔNSUN , and  Myc-AtSUN2ΔNSUN  were amplified by overlap extension PCR and were cloned into the
and  Myc-AtSUN2  were moved to pGWB21 ( Nakagawa et al., 2007 ) to obtain  Myc-Flag-AtSUN1  and  Myc-AtSUN2 .  Myc-AtSUN2ΔNSUN  was moved to pK7WGF2 ( Karimi et al., 2002 ) to obtain  GFP-Myc-AtSUN2ΔNSUN .  Flag-AtSUN1 ,  Flag-AtSUN1ΔNSUN ,  Myc-AtSUN2 , and  Myc-AtSUN2ΔNSUN  were moved to pK7WGR2 ( Karimi et al., 2002 ) to obtain the RFP-fused constructs. PCR-based cloning was used to generate the other constructs, and the primers used are listed in  Table S1 . In brief,  Lifeact  was amplified by
by PCR.  NLS-GFP-NES  was amplified by overlapping PCR using vector pK7WGF2 as a template. All PCR products were cloned into the pENTR/D-TOPO vector and confirmed by sequencing. These clones were then used as templates for amplifying  SINE1ΔTVPT ,  SINE1XT
and confirmed by sequencing. The coding sequences cloned into pENTR/D-TOPO were moved to destination vectors described by  Karimi et al. (2002)  by LR reaction (Invitrogen) to obtain N-terminal GFP-tagged protein constructs:  Lifeact  was cloned into pH7WGR2;  SINE1 ,  SINE1ΔTVPT ,  SINE1XT ,  SINE1 1–308 ,  SINE2 ,  SINE2ΔLVPT ,  SINE2XT ,  SINE2 1–309 ,  SINE2ΔKASH ,  SINE3ΔPLPT ,  SINE3XT ,  SINE4 ,  SINE4ΔLVPT ,  SINE5ΔLVPT , and  NLS-GFP-NES  were cloned into pK7WGF2; and  SINE3  and  SINE5  were cloned into pH7WGF2.  Flag-AtSUN1dMut  and  Myc-AtSUN2dMut  were obtained using the site-directed mutagenesis kit (QuikChange; Agilent Technologies), and the pENTR/D-TOPO vector containing
GAATTC ATCAGCTTGCATGCCGGTCGATC-3′ and 5′-GCT GAATTC ATCATACATGAGAATTAAGGGAGTC-3′ (the EcoRI site is underlined), digested by EcoRI, and then ligated with the EcoRI-digested binary vector pPZP-RCS2 ( Goderis et al., 2002 ). After confirmation by sequencing, the pPZP-RCS2-Hyg vector was obtained. The GFP-Gateway-35ST (35S terminator of Cauliflower Mosaic Virus) cassette was amplified by PCR using 5′-TAT GGCGCGC[C ACGTG]AGCAAGGGCGAGGAGCTGTTC-3′ (the AscI site is underlined, and the PmlI site is shown in brackets) and 5′-CCGGGGATCC TCTAGA GGGCC-3′ (the XbaI site is underlined), digested by
listed in Table S1), digested with AscI, and linked to the AscI–PmlI-digested pHOAG to obtain pHSINE1proAG and pHSINE2proAG, respectively. By LR reaction, the  SINE1  coding sequence was moved from the pENTR/D-TOPO to pHSINE1proAG to obtain the  SINE1pro::GFP-SINE1  construct, and the  SINE2  coding sequence was moved from the pENTR/D-TOPO to pHSINE2proAG to obtain the  SINE2pro::GFP-SINE1  construct. Agrobacterium tumefaciens  transformation A. tumefaciens  strain ABI was transformed with the corresponding constructs by triparental mating ( Wise et al., 2006 ). In brief, the  Escherichia coli  carrying
 leaves were collected and ground in liquid nitrogen into powders, and co-IP experiments were performed at 4°C. 1 ml radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% Na-deoxycholate, 1% NP-40, 1 mM PMSF, and 1% protease inhibitor cocktail [Sigma-Aldrich]) was used to extract 500 µl of plant tissue. One tenth of the protein extracts was used as the input sample, and the rest were used for IP using protein A–Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare) precoated with a rabbit anti-GFP antibody (ab290; Abcam). After 3× wash using radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer, the immunoprecipitates and the input samples were separated by 8 or 10% SDS-PAGE, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Bio-Rad Laboratories), and detected with a mouse anti-GFP (1:2,000; 632569; Takara Bio Inc.) or a mouse anti-Myc (1:,000; M5546; Sigma-Aldrich) antibody. The input/IP ratio is 1:9. Confocal microscopy and FRAP assay 7–10-d-old  A. thaliana  seedlings were imaged using a confocal microscope (Eclipse C90i; Nikon) with
cell nuclei, the ROI was always 51 µm 2 , and for all FRAP experiments of  A. thaliana  leaf guard cell nuclei, the ROI was always 19 µm 2 . For each sample, 35 nuclei were investigated. Fluorescent intensity in the ROI was observed—5 prebleach and 35 postbleach measurements were collected
cotyledon side were counted using a fluorescent stereomicroscope (M165 FC; Leica) with a UV filter (Leica). Online supplemental material Fig. S1 shows amino acid sequence alignment of the C-terminal domains of WIP family members and a flow chart of DORY. Fig. S2 shows amino acid sequence
