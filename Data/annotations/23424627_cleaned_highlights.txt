ABSTRACT:
RESULTS:
shown to the left, and corresponding confocal fluorescence micrographs to the right. A) A negative control showing a wild type pollen tube without any GFP. B and C), GFP-CNGC7 in  cngc7-3−/−, 8-1 −/− showing a tip focused PM (plasma membrane) localization at the emerging tube (B) and the tip shank during tube extension (C). D) A non-rescued pollen from  cngc7-3−/−, 8-1−/−  (segregating a GFP-CNGC7) showing a typical bursting event at germination. Scale bar = 10 µm. A  cngc7/8
frequency was around 90%, which was about 10-fold higher than wild type controls. CNGC7 is Localized to the Plasma Membrane of Pollen Tubes To provide evidence for the subcellular location of CNGC7, fluorescence confocal microscopy was used to image GFP-CNGC7 in pollen. All imaging was done with homozygous  cngc7/8  mutants that had been rescued by pollen expression
MATERIALS AND METHODS:
can be found at TAIR, The Arabidopsis Information Resource ( http://www.arabidopsis.org/ ), under the following accession numbers: At1g15990 and At1g19780, respectively. Plant Growth Conditions Arabidopsis thaliana  ecotype Columbia (wild type Col-0 and transgenic plants) were germinated on half-strength MS medium (Murashige and Skoog, 1962) with 0.05% (w/v) MES, 0.5% (w/v) sucrose, pH 5.7, and 1% (w/v) agar, under
 Col-0 pSPORT cDNA library (Invitrogen) using primers 1148a and 1148br ( Figure S2 ). F to W substitutions were engineered by a two-step PCR  [48] . All sequences derived from PCR reactions were verified by DNA sequencing. 9p-i-GFP-CNGC7  (ps1300) encodes a GFP-tagged CNGC7, expressed under the control of a  9p  promoter.  18p-i-FLAG-CNGC 7  (ps1692) encodes a FLAG epitope  [49] ,  [50]  tagged CNGC7, expressed under the control of the  CNGC18  promoter.
