ABSTRACT:
and AtYSL3), but there is little information concerning members of the other two well-conserved YSL clades. Here, we provide evidence that AtYSL4 and AtYSL6, which are the only genes in Arabidopsis belong to YSL Group II, are localized to vacuole membranes and to internal membranes resembling endoplasmic reticulum. Both single and double mutants for YSL4 and YSL6 were rigorously analyzed, and have surprisingly mild phenotypes, in spite of the strong and wide-ranging expression of YSL6. However, in the presence of toxic levels of Mn and Ni, plants
RESULTS:
 2009 ; Chu et al.,  2010 ), a proteomics study of Arabidopsis vacuoles identified AtYSL4 and AtYSL6 in the tonoplast proteome (Jaquinod et al.,  2007 ). To investigate this, we used Arabidopsis protoplasts to transiently express GFP-tagged AtYSL4 and AtYSL6. When protoplasts were transformed with either AtYSL4 or AtYSL6 tagged with GFP at the C-terminus, very few cells became labeled. Indeed, we were unable to observe fluorescence signals in the case of AtYSL6. In the small number of YSL4-GFP transformants identified, we observed fluorescent label accumulating within the ER (data not shown). Based on these findings, we tentatively concluded that end-labeled AtYSL4 and AtYSL6 were being abnormally processed, and we constructed versions of AtYSL4 and AtYSL6 that contain GFP labels in non-conserved regions within each protein (AtYSL4-GFPmid and
 AtYSL4-GFPmid  or  AtYSL6-GFPmid  in addition to γ -TIP-mCherry , which served as a vacuolar marker. In a separate experiment, we stained protoplasts transformed with  AtYSL6-GFPmid  with FM-464 to provide a marker for internal membranes. It was evident that GFPmid-tagged AtYSL4 localized to the tonoplast membrane, based on colocalization with γ-TIP-mCherry (Figure  4 ,  Top row ). Additionally, AtYSL6 also localized to the tonoplast membrane, based on colocalization with γ-TIP-mCherry and FM-464 (Figure  4 ,

Bottom row:  protoplast transformed with  AtYSL6-GFPmid  and stained with the membrane-selective dye FM-464. Scale bar = 10 um. The  AtYSL6-GFPmid  construct was also used to stably transform Arabidopsis plants. The resulting transgenic plants were morphologically normal, indicating that overexpression of this membrane protein did not cause serious problems with the endomembrane system. In the stable transformants, the GFP signal was most readily observed in the guard cells (Figures  5A – I ) Notably, not every cell contained fluorescent material, in spite of the fact that the  AtYSL6-GFPmid

MATERIALS AND METHODS:
translational fusion to the GUS reporter gene. The  AtYSL4p ::GUS and  AtYSL6p ::GUS constructs were then stably introduced into Arabidopsis using the floral dip method (Clough and Bent,  1998 ). T1 seeds were germinated on 1X MS medium with 50 μM kanamycin to select for transformants, and seedlings were transferred
samples for mineral analysis For soil-grown plants, leaf samples were collected 20 days after sowing and dried in an oven at 60°C. ICP-MS was performed as described previously (Lahner et al.,  2003 ). Construction of GFP-mid tagged proteins AtYSL4  (At5g41000) and  AtYSL6  (At3g27020) cDNAs were amplified by RT-PCR using Platinum  Taq  DNA Polymerase High Fidelity (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA).  AtYSL4  cDNA was amplified using the primers 5′-TCTGAGAGTGAGAGGAATCACTGAAAA-3′ and 5′-GTCTCGGATGGTCTAAAGTACATACAAATGGGTG-3′.  AtYSL6  cDNA was amplified using the primers 5′-GCTAAAACATGGGGACGGAGATCCC-3′ and 5′-CTCTCTCTTGCTGAGGACGGTCCAAA-3′.  AtYSL4  and  AtYSL6  cDNA were then cloned into the Gateway vector pCR8/GW/TOPO (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Using the “megaprimer” method,  smGFP  (Davis and Vierstra,  1998 ) was incorporated into  AtYSL4  between position 1053 and 1054 in the cDNA (corresponding to amino acid position 351) and  AtYSL6  between position 1086 and 1087 in the cDNA
on protein structure predictions, these positions correspond to extracellular loops that are weakly conserved among YSLs. The primers 5′-GCAACAAAAGCTCCAGACAAGGGATCCAAGGAGATATAACAATGA-3′ and 5′-GTCGGTAAAGACAGGTAGGTTGTGTTTGTATAGTTCATCCATGCCAT-3′ (for  AtYSL4 ), and 5′-CAATCTACCCATTGTTACCGACGGGATCCAAGGAGATATAACAATGA-3′ and 5′-GAAGCTTCACTGTCATCTACACCTTTGTATAGTTCATCCATGCCAT-3′ (for  AtYSL6 ) were used to amplify the plasmid psmGFP (CD3-326, available from ABRC) to create megaprimers containing the smGFP sequence flanked by specific YSL sequences. These megaprimers were gel purified and used in a modified site-directed mutagenesis protocol to introduce the smGFP sequence into the AtYSL4 and AtYSL6 clones described above. This was accomplished using 440 ng of purified megaprimers, 50 ng of target vector (either  YSL4  or  YSL6  cDNA in pCR8/GW/TOPO, described above), 0.6 mM dNTP
remove the methylated parent plasmid, 2 ml of each reaction was used to transform TOP10™ chemically competent  E. coli  (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Positive clones were verified by restriction digestion and sequencing to ensure incorporation of the full smGFP sequence. An LR recombination reaction was then performed to transfer  AtYSL4-GFPmid  and  AtYSL6-GFPmid  into the vector pB7WG2 (Karimi et al.,  2002 ) for subsequent transient expression in Arabidopsis protoplasts in addition to stable expression in Arabidopsis plants. Protoplast isolation and transformation Protoplasts were isolated using the Tape-Arabidopsis Sandwich method (Wu
(154 mM NaCl, 125 mM CaCl 2 , 5 mM KCl, 5 mM glucose, 2 mM MES pH 5.7), resuspended in 200–500 μL modified W5, and incubated at room temperature in Mattek™ dishes for 16 to 24 h.  AtYSL4-GFPmid  or  AtYSL6-GFPmid  in pB7GW2 was co-transformed with CD3-976, which is available from TAIR ( www.arabidopsis.org ) and contains γ-TIP fused to mCherry. Staining of protoplasts with FM-464 The lipophilic dye FM-464 was applied to transformed protoplasts at a final concentration
