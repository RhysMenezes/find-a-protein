 2008 ). The gel strip then was horizontally transferred on top of a third dimension SDS gel (16% polyacrylamide) and gel electrophoresis was carried out in the absence of urea. Gel staining procedures Polyacrylamide gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue G250 according to the protocol of Neuhoff et al. ( 1988 ,  1990 ). Protein identification by mass spectrometry Tryptic digestion of proteins and identification of proteins by MS were performed as described by Klodmann et al. ( 2010 ). Procedures were based on peptide separation using the EASY-nLC System (Proxeon; Thermo Scientific, Bremen, Germany) and coupled MS analyses using the MicrOTOF-Q II mass spectrometer (Bruker Bremen, Germany). MS data evaluation was carried out using ProteinScape2.1 software (Bruker, Bremen, Germany), the Mascot search engine (Matrix Science, London, UK), and (1) the  Arabidopsis  protein database 1  as well as (2) an updated version of the complex
acids, significance threshold was set to 0.05 and protein and peptide assessments were carried out if the Mascot Score was greater than 30 for proteins and 20 for peptides. Image processing and database generation using GelMap Coomassie-blue stained 3D BN/SDS/SDS gels of complex I were scanned using the Image Scanner III (GE Healthcare). Spot coordinates were generated using Microsoft Office Paint. The gel image and a file containing all relevant MS data including the spot coordinates were exported into
