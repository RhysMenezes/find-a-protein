ABSTRACT:
RESULTS:
Arabidopsis  chloroplast preparations from mature rosette plants were used. Each preparation was separated into a soluble stromal and membrane fraction and then resolved by 1D SDS-PAGE, followed by in-gel trypsin digestion and identification by online nano-liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (nanoLC-MS/MS) with an LTQ-Orbitrap, using data dependent acquisition (DDA) and dynamic exclusion. Biological replicates were analyzed two or
MS/MS spectra (possibly in different charge states) of only 1 peptide sequence. Examples are AT5G39560 (WAVE protein) and At5G01730 (KELCH protein) each multiple times identified with peptides IEWINSVLTVPL and EDLISPR, respectively. Applying these two simple filters resulted in 739 nuclear-encoded

 Arabidopsis   [64] . Putative lumenal protein AT2G36145.1 has no predicted function, nor predicted TMD and a maize homologue (TC294822) was found in maize thylakoids (Majeran et al, submitted). Putative lumenal protein AT5G42765 was identified with strong MS data in the thylakoid and the most N-terminal (semi-tryptic) peptide suggests an lTP cleavage site of AFA↓FSLGISGPK ( Table 2 ).

MATERIALS AND METHODS:
thylakoid samples for some of the 156 proteins, which were identified in all nine experiments and provides a good indication of their subchloroplast localization. Protein analysis by Mass spectrometry 400 µg of thylakoid or stromal proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE (12% acrylamide) and stained with Coomassie Brilliant blue. Each gel lane was cut into 12 bands followed by reduction, alkylation, in-gel digestion with trypsin and peptides were extracted, as described in  [81] . Peptide extracts were dried down
s and a dynamic exclusion window of 240 s. Argon was used as collision gas. All MS data from the Q-TOF were processed using Mascot Distiller (v2.0) and the resulting peak lists (in mgf files) were searched again against ATH1v6 database concatenated with a decoy where all the sequences were in reversed orientation using Mascot with
µl.min −1  to 200 nl.min −1 . Each sample injection and analysis was followed by two blank injections using 60-min and 45-min gradients to prevent carry over from sample to sample. The acquisition cycle consisted of a survey FTMS scan at the highest resolving power (100,000), followed by 5 data-dependent MS/MS scans acquired in the LTQ. Dynamic exclusion was used with the following parameters: exclusion size 500, repeat count 2, repeat duration 30 s, exclusion time 180 s,
±30 ppm. Peptides with the ion scores above 45 were chosen as benchmarks for off-line recalibration. Recalibration was performed using a Perl script which adjusted precursor masses in the peak lists. The recalibrated peak lists were searched again against ATH1v6 database concatenated with a decoy where all the sequences were in reversed orientation. For each of the peak lists three searches were performed: 1)  tryptic

The complete list of published proteomics papers and each of their accessions can be downloaded from PPDB ( http://ppdb.tc.cornell.edu/searchpub.aspx ). As a rule of thumb, subcellular localization by GFP/YFP and western blots was considered strong evidence, although we noted that there are several examples of incorrect subcellular localization assignment based on GFP/YFP, as discussed in
