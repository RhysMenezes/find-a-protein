ABSTRACT:
were identified, of which 188 were predicted to be integral membrane proteins. Major classes were transporters, receptors, proteins involved in membrane trafficking and cell wall-related proteins. Forty-one of the integral proteins, including nine of the 13 isoforms of the PIP (plasma membrane intrinsic protein) aquaporin subfamily, could be identified by peptides unique to these proteins, which made it possible to determine their relative abundance in leaf and root tissue. In addition, peptides shared between isoforms gave information on the

standards used in the SDS-PAGE; the scale is therefore not lineal. Four of the PIPs showed a tissue-specific localization: PIP1;5, 2;3, and 2;4 were only found in root tissue, whereas PIP2;6 was only found in leaf tissue. A peptide (VGANKFPER;  Table 1 ), shared between all members of the PIP1 subfamily, with a q-value of 0.41 suggests that the PIP1 subfamily is 50% more abundant in leaf tissue than in root tissue. There is a fair agreement between

in Arabidopsis as shown by reversed transcription-PCR (RT-PCR)  [29]  and confirmed for the Qa-SNARES SYP121 and 132 using GFP-fusion proteins  [30] . A ubiquitous expression of plant SNAREs is supported by a recent proteomic study on plasma membranes isolated from leaves, xylem and phloem from poplar trees  [11] ; in the poplar
ZmDWF1 was shown to be expressed in all tissues examined, with a relatively high expression in roots, particularly in young, actively developing roots  [38] , which compares well with our q-value of 0.70. The progesterone binding protein, MSBP2 (membrane steroid binding protein 2), is expressed in rosette leaves of Arabidopsis  [39]  as determined with RNA blots; however, roots were not investigated. We found MSBP2 about equally distributed between roots and leaves. The  NHL3  gene
MATERIALS AND METHODS:
(BSA) as a standard. SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting Samples were solubilized at room temperature in standard sample buffer, and polypeptides were separated by SDS-PAGE (12% acrylamide, 0.3% bisacrylamide) according to Laemmli  [6] . Gels were either stained with colloidal Coomassie  [7] , or polypeptides were electrophoretically transferred to an Immobilon polyvinylidene difluoride transfer membrane (Millipore, USA) for immunostaining. After blocking in 2% (w/v) BSA in phosphate buffered saline (PBS: 0.15 M NaCl, 0.01 M potassium phosphate, pH 7.5)
In-gel digestion Each lane on the SDS-gel was divided into 36 segments for trypsin digestion. The gel segments were placed in 96-well plates and washed twice in 75 µl 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate, 50% ethanol buffer to remove the commassie staining. After dehydration in 75 µl
96 min, 100% B: 96 to 106 min, 0% B. Fraction collection was performed from 28 min to 56,5 min in 0,15 min intervals. Mass spectrometry, MS/MS and protein identification MS and MS/MS spectra were acquired on a 4700 MALDI TOF/TOF mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems, Framingham, CA, USA) in positive reflector mode. Matrix solution, 0.5 µl containing 5 mg/ml α-cyano-4-hydroxy cinnamic acid, 50% acetonitrile, 1% TFA and 25 mM citric acid, was added onto the dried peptide sample eluted
either on a  14 N or a  15 N medium. Left panel: Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and protein bands were excised for proteolysis. Peptides were separated by reversed-phase nano-liquid chromatography (RP nano-LC) and analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS/MS for peptide and protein identification, and construction of a peptide library. Right panel: leaf and root plasma membrane preparations were combined at a 1∶1 protein ratio and proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE. Protein bands were excised, digested, and peptides were separated by RP nano-LC and analyzed by MALDI MS. Finally, the relative abundance of individual proteins in leaf and root plasma membranes was determined from the signal intensities of the  14 N/ 15 N peptide pairs (Compare  Fig. 4 , below). Briefly, the program reads
