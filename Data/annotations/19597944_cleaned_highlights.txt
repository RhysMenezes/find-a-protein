75% B in 25 min. The subtraction of the mass spectrometer total ion chromatogram of wild-type plants from that of the mutants (using the software package Metabolite Detect 1.1, Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany) identified two additional peaks in  ipmi lsu1-3  extracts not found in wild-type extracts corresponding to molecular masses of 176 (compound  1 ) and 238 (compound  2 ). The former was unambiguously identified as 2-isopropylmalate (2-IPM) by identical retention times with an authentic 2-IPM
and identical fragmentation patterns in MS 2  experiments in the negative ionization mode as described above. Spectroscopic identification of compound  2 , 2-(3′-methylsulfinyl)propylmalate 2-(3′-Methylsulfinyl)propylmalate (compound  2 ) was isolated from aqueous leaf extracts from  ipmi lsu1-3  plants by preparative HPLC and analyzed by mass spectrometry as described above, both positive and negative ionization modes were employed. High resolution electrospray ionization (ESI) mass spectra were recorded on a Bruker microTOF mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany). NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker AV 500 spectrometer (Bruker Biospin, Rheinstetten, Germany) equipped with a CryoPlatform.  1 H NMR,  1 H– 1 H COSY, HSQC and HMBC spectra were recorded
49.05 ppm for  13 C signals). 2-(3′-Methylsulfinyl)propylmalate (2),  1 H and  13 C NMR (see Supplemental Table S2) Low resolution ESI-MS: m/z 238.9 [M + H] +  and m/z 237.0 [M−H] −  MS 2  experiments with LRESIMS resulted in following fragments: fragments of m/z 238.9 [M + H] + : 193.0 [M−CO 2 H 2 ] +  31.8%, 174.9 [M–CH 3 –SHO] +  38.3%, 129.0 [M–CO 2 H 2 –CH 3 –SHO] +  6.7%; fragments
 7.5%, 176.9 [M–CH 3 –CO 2 H] −  28.9%, 172.9 [M–CH 3 –SHO] −  33.9%. The molecular formula of compound  2  was determined to be C 8 H 14 O 6 S (calculated monoisotopic mass 238.0511) from the [M−H] −  ion peak at  m/z  237.0427 in high resolution ESI-MS. NMR spectroscopy ( 1 H, COSY, HSQC, HMBC) revealed 8 carbon signals of which two low field resonances at 180.3 and 175.6 ppm indicated the carboxylic functions of the substituted malate, followed by another quaternary carbon resonance at 75.5 ppm (position

Miscellaneous methods Standard methods of molecular biology were done as described (Sambrook and Russel  2001 ). GFP tagging experiments were
