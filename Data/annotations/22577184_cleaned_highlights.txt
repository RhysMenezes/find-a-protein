ABSTRACT:
p24 proteins are a family of type I membrane proteins localized to compartments of the early secretory pathway and to coat protein I (COPI)- and COPII-coated vesicles. They can be classified, by sequence homology, into four subfamilies, named p24α, p24β, p24γ, and p24δ. In contrast to animals and fungi, plants contain only members of the p24β and p24δ subfamilies. It has previously been shown that transiently expressed red fluorescent protein (RFP)–p24δ5 localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) as a consequence of highly efficient COPI-based recycling from the Golgi apparatus. Using specific antibodies, endogenous p24δ5 has now been localized to the ER and p24β2 to the Golgi apparatus in  Arabidopsis  root tip cells by immunogold electron microscopy. The relative contributions of the cytosolic tail and the luminal domains to p24δ5 trafficking have also been characterized. It is demonstrated that

trans -Golgi. Scale bars=300 nm. The dilysine motif in the cytoplasmic tail of p24δ5 is sufficient for its trafficking in the early secretory pathway It was previously demonstrated that transiently expressed RFP–p24δ5 shows a uniform signal distribution throughout the ER, both in tobacco mesophyll and in  Arabidopsis  protoplasts ( Langhans  et al. , 2008 ), as well as in BY2 cells ( Langhans  et al. , 2008
motif at the cytoplasmic tail of p24δ5 is sufficient for ER localization and trafficking in the early secretory pathway, or if the luminal GOLD and coiled-coil domains could also play a role has now been investigated. To this end, RFP–p24δ5 deletion mutants lacking either the GOLD or the coiled-coil domains
of the different constructs was also confirmed in  Arabidopsis  protoplasts (see below). As shown in  Fig. 5A and B , both deletion mutants localized exclusively to the ER, where they co-localized extensively with the ER marker GFP–HDEL. This suggests that the steady-state localization of RFP–p24δ5 at the ER is not dependent on the GOLD or the coiled-coil domains. A deletion mutant lacking both the GOLD and the coiled-coil domains (and thus having only the transmembrane domain and the cytosolic tail), RFP–p24δ5 (TM-CT) ( Fig. 1B ), also localized exclusively to the ER ( Fig. 5C ), indicating that the dilysine motif in the cytosolic tail constitutes the minimal requirement for the steady-state localization of RFP–p24δ5 to the ER. The same ER localization was obtained when these constructs were expressed in  Arabidopsis  protoplasts ( Supplementary Fig. S3A–F  at  JXB  online). Furthermore, this ER localization was not a consequence of overexpression, since all constructs localized to the ER even at very low expression levels ( Supplementary Fig. S4 ). It was also tested whether GOLD or coiled-coil domains were involved in anterograde ER to Golgi transport of RFP–p24δ5. To this end, the three deletion mutants were co-expressed with the ARF1(Q71L) mutant, in order to inhibit retrograde Golgi to ER transport ( Langhans  et al. , 2008 ). In this case, RFP–p24δ5 deletion mutants still localized to the ER, but also to Golgi-like punctae, where they co-localized with the Golgi marker Man1–GFP ( Fig. 5D–F ), as was the case for RFP–p24δ5 ( Langhans  et al. , 2008 ). Therefore, the GOLD and coiled-coil domains do not seem to have an influence on trafficking and localization of RFP–p24δ5 in the early secretory pathway, at least when expressed individually. Fig. 5.

(A–C) RFP–p24δ5 deletion mutants lacking the coiled-coil domain (ΔCC) (A), the GOLD domain (ΔGOLD) (B), or both (TM-CT) (C) show a typical ER pattern and co-localize with the ER marker GFP–HDEL. (D–F) RFP–p24δ5 deletion mutants lacking the coiled-coil domain (ΔCC) (D), the GOLD domain (ΔGOLD) (E), or both (TM-CT) (F) co-localize partially with Man1–GFP in Golgi-like punctae upon ARF1(Q71L) mutant expression. (G and J) An RFP–p24δ5 dilysine mutant lacking the GOLD domain (ΔGOLD, CT SS ) shows a prominent vacuolar labelling but it also co-localizes partially in punctae with Golgi (ST–YFP; blue) or PVC (GFP–BP80; green) markers. (H and K) An RFP–p24δ5 dilysine mutant lacking the coiled-coil domain (ΔCC, CT SS ) shows a weak vacuolar labelling but it also co-localizes partially in punctae with Golgi (ST–YFP; blue) or PVC (GFP–BP80; green) markers. (I and L) An RFP–p24δ5 dilysine mutant with the transmembrane domain and the cytoplasmic tail (TM-CT SS ) co-localizes partially with the ER marker GFP–HDEL and the Golgi marker Man1–GFP. Scale bars=5 μm. The luminal domain may be involved in transport of p24δ5 beyond the early secretory pathway In mammals, the luminal domain of p24 proteins has been proposed to play a role in trafficking of p23 (p24α) to the cell surface ( Blum and Lepier, 2008 ). It was previously found that RFP–p24δ5 mutants lacking the dilysine motif were no longer present at the ER but were transported downstream to the pre-vacuolar compartment (PVC) and the vacuole ( Langhans  et al. , 2008 ). Therefore, it was decided to investigate whether the GOLD and/or the coiled-coil domains could play a role in RFP–p24δ5 trafficking in the absence of the dilysine motif. To this end, RFP–p24δ5
domains were prepared ( Fig. 1B ). As shown in  Fig. 5G, H, J, and K , none of these mutants was found at the ER. In contrast, they localized to the Golgi (as shown by co-localization with ST–YFP), the PVC (as shown by co-localization with GFP–BP80), and the vacuole lumen. The dilysine mutant lacking the GOLD domain had a more prominent vacuolar labelling than the dilysine mutant lacking the coiled-coil domain ( Fig. 5G, H, J, K ). This suggests that the coiled-coil domain facilitates
Finally, a dilysine mutant lacking both the GOLD and the coiled-coil domains (RFP–p24δ5, TM-CT SS ) was used. As shown in  Fig. 5I and L , this was the only dilysine mutant which was partially localized to the ER, showing a partial co-localization with the ER marker GFP–HDEL. It also showed co-localization with the Golgi marker Man1–GFP and eventually with GFP–BP80 (data not shown), but was rarely seen in the vacuole lumen. Altogether, it seems that the absence of the luminal domain impairs trafficking from the ER to the Golgi, and downstream to the PVC and the vacuole. The lower
 trafficking and localization of RFP–p24δ5, but with GFP instead of RFP, was prepared ( Fig. 1B ). Surprisingly, the GFP signal obtained upon expression of GFP–p24β2 appeared to be very low. However, GFP–p24β2 was not present at the ER, in contrast to RFP–p24δ5, but showed a punctate pattern, and it co-localized partially with the Golgi marker Man1–RFP, in both tobacco mesophyll ( Fig. 7A–C ) and  Arabidopsis  protoplasts ( Fig. 7G–I ), but not with the PVC marker ARA6–RFP ( Fig. 7D–F ).

GFP–p24β2 (G) co-localizes partially with the Golgi marker Man1–RFP (H) in punctate structures (merged image in I). Arrowheads point to co-localizing signals. Scale bars=5 μm. Interestingly, when co-expressed with RFP–p24δ5, the signal of GFP–p24β2 was clearly more intense and localized to punctae. In addition, it was observed that RFP–p24δ5, which showed its typical ER pattern, also localized to the same punctae under these conditions ( Fig. 8A–C ). An increased ratio in the concentrations of GFP–p24β2 versus RFP–p24δ5 induced a progressive change in the localization of RFP–p24δ5, from its typical reticulate ER pattern to a mostly punctated one, and increased co-localization between both proteins ( Fig. 8D–F ;  Supplementary Fig. S5  at  JXB  online). This suggests that GFP–p24β2 is able to interact with RFP–p24δ5 and is transported with the latter out of the ER. This co-localization was also observed when both proteins were expressed in  Arabidopsis  protoplasts ( Supplementary Fig. S3G–I ). Fig. 8. GFP–p24β2 and RFP–p24δ5 co-localize in punctae via the coiled-coil domain. (A–M) Transient gene expression in tobacco mesophyll
1B ). In this case, almost no co-localization was detected between both proteins ( Fig. 8G–I ). In addition, the signal of GFP–p24β2 was weak, as it happened in the absence of RFP–p24δ5, and RFP–p24δ5 (ΔCC) showed its typical ER pattern, without punctae, even in the presence of increasing concentrations of GFP–p24β2 ( Supplementary Fig. S6  at  JXB  online). This suggests that both proteins interact with each other via their coiled-coil domain and that this interaction
independent of the presence of GFP–p24β2 ( Fig. 6 ). In order to narrow down the identity of the compartment(s) where RFP–p24δ5 and GFP–p24β2 co-localize, RFP–p24δ5 and GFP–p24β2 were co-expressed with 6 kDa VP–CFP (cyan fluorescent protein), a putative COPII/ERES marker ( Lerich  et al. , 2011 ). As shown in  Fig. 8J–M , a high degree of co-localization was observed between the three proteins in punctate structures, suggesting that a fraction of RFP–p24δ5 and GFP–p24β2 is present in COPII-labelled structures. Whether the observed co-localization/interaction between RFP–p24δ5 and GFP–p24β2 correlated with their trafficking was next investigated. To this end, both proteins were co-expressed with the ARF1(Q71L) mutant, to interfere with retrograde Golgi to ER transport. This mutant expression has been shown to redistribute RFP–p24δ5 partially from the ER to Golgi-like punctae ( Langhans  et al. , 2008 ). However, when GFP–p24β2 was co-expressed with the ARF1(Q71L) mutant, it showed a prominent vacuolar labelling and did not co-localize with ManI–RFP ( Fig. 9A–C ). This suggests that GFP–p24β2 localizes to the Golgi at steady state but may also cycle between the ER and Golgi. Thus, when retrograde Golgi to ER transport is blocked, the protein is then transported by default to the vacuole. In contrast, when both RFP–p24δ5 and GFP–p24β2 were expressed together under the same conditions [ARF1(Q71L) mutant expression], GFP–p24β2 was not transported to the vacuole but co-localized in punctae with RFP–p24δ5 ( Fig. 9D–F ). This suggests that RFP–p24δ5 holds back GFP–p24β2 in the ER–Golgi interface. Since both proteins co-localize in punctate structures, it was speculated that some of these punctae may correspond to Golgi stacks. To check this, protoplasts were treated with brefeldin A (BFA). After 1 h treatment, a fraction of both proteins had redistributed to the ER, as is the case for standard Golgi marker proteins, for example ManI–(X)FP, which relocate to the ER under these conditions ( Langhans  et al. , 2011 ). In contrast, many of the punctate structures were BFA resistant ( Fig. 9G–I ) and could represent the fraction of both proteins present in COPII-labelled structures. However, it was possible to observe a redistribution of both proteins to the ER after 2 h of BFA treatment ( Supplementary Fig. S7  at  JXB  online). Altogether, these experiments indicate that RFP–p24δ5 and GFP–p24β2 traffic together at the ER–Golgi interface. Fig. 9. Coupled trafficking of RFP–p24δ5 and GFP–p24β2 at the ER–Golgi interface. (A–F) Transient gene expression in tobacco mesophyll protoplasts. (A–C) GFP–p24β2 (A) is transported to the vacuole upon co-expression with the ARF1(Q71L) mutant and shows no co-localization with the Golgi marker Man1–RFP (B) (merged image in C). (D–F) GFP–p24β2 (D) is not transported to the vacuole upon co-expression of the ARF1(Q71L) mutant in the presence of RFP–p24δ5 (E) but both proteins co-localize in punctate structures (see merged image in F). (G–I) Treatment with BFA (1 h, 90 μM) after co-expression of GFP–p24β2 (G) and RFP–p24δ5 (H) induces a partial relocalization of both proteins to the ER, but many punctate structures still remain (merged image in I). Scale bars=5 μm. Interaction between p24 proteins Since the above experiments suggested an interaction between p24δ5 and p24β2,
MATERIALS AND METHODS:
cultivated as described ( Ortiz-Zapater  et al. , 2006 ). Tobacco plants ( Nicotiana tabacum  var. SR1) were grown as described ( Pimpl  et al. , 2006 ). Recombinant plasmid production The coding sequence of green fluorescent protein (GFP)–p24β2 was commercially synthesized  de novo  (Geneart AG) based on the sequence of GFP and that of the  Arabidopsis  p24 protein At3g07680 (p24β2). The sequence of the fluorophore is behind the coding sequences of the p24 signal sequence (SS) and the 5' extreme end of the mature p24 coding sequence. The ΔCC, ΔGOLD, ΔCC-CT SS , ΔGOLD-CT SS , TMCT, and TMCT-CT SS  mutants of red fluorescent protein (RFP)–p24δ5 were obtained by 3' deletion of RFP–p24δ5 and synthesis of a new sequence ( Langhans  et al. , 2008 ). The coding sequences of XFP–p24β2/δ5 were cloned into the pBP30 vector (carrying the  35 S promoter,  Nebenführ  et al. , 1999 ) through  Bgl II/ Not I. Plasmids encoding marker proteins were: RFP–p24δ5 and RFP–p24δ5-CT SS  (mutant1) ( Langhans  et al. , 2008 ), ST–yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) ( Brandizzi  et al. , 2002 ), Man1–RFP and Man1–GFP ( Nebenführ  et al. , 1999 ), GFP–HDEL ( Nebenführ  et al. , 2000 ), ARA6–RFP ( Ueda  et al. , 2004 ), GFP–BP80 ( daSilva  et al. , 2005 ), and ARF1(Q71L) ( Pimpl  et al. , 2003 ). All RFP-tagged proteins were tagged with monomeric RFP (mRFP) to prevent oligomerization. Similarly, only mGFP5 was used for GFP-tagged proteins. Isolation of protoplasts and transient gene expression Mesophyll protoplasts from  N. tabacum  var. SR1 leaf cells were isolated and transfected as previously described ( Bubeck  et al. , 2008 ). Unless otherwise stated, 1–50 μg
different  Arabidopsis  p24 proteins were generated by Eurogentec (Belgium,  http://www.eurogentec.com ) using as antigen peptides corresponding either to the N- or to the C-terminus of the indicated proteins: p24δ5-Ct (YLKRYFHKKKLI), p24δ5-Nt (IWLTIPTTGG), p24β2-Nt (IRFVIDREE), and p24β2-Ct (LFERKLGMSRV). Affinity-purified antibodies (Eurogentec) were used for immunogold labelling as well as for covalent binding to magnetic beads in co-immunoprecipitation experiments (see below). Confocal microscopy and immunofluorescence labelling Imaging was performed using a Zeiss Axiovert LSM510 Meta confocal laser scanning microscope. At the Metadetector, the main beam splitters (HFT) 458/514 and 488/543 were used. The following fluorophores (excited and emitted by frame switching in the multitracking mode) were used: GFP (488 nm/496–518 nm), YFP (514 nm/529–550 nm), and RFP (543 nm/593–636 nm). To verify the co-localization of fluorescent
