and AtPUB43. The domain structure of AtPUB43 is schematically depicted in Figure  1A . To test whether the C-terminal ARM repeat domain is also essential for plasma membrane-association of AtPUB43, we analyzed the localization of fusion proteins between GFP and truncated AtPUB43 proteins by confocal laser scanning microscopy on transformed Arabidopsis protoplasts. As for SAUL1, deletion of the N-terminal part of AtPUB43 in AtPUB43ΔARM 1−6 -GFP proteins did not result in the loss of plasma membrane-association (Figure  1B ). This deletion protein, however, was not equally distributed in the plasma membrane, but occurred in large patches (Figures  1B,C ). A similar
previously (Drechsel et al.,  2011 ). In a next step, either ARM repeats 7–12 or 10–12 were deleted in AtPUB43. Both proteins, AtPUB43ΔARM 7−12 -GFP and AtPUB43ΔARM 10−12 -GFP, were localized to the cytoplasm and not to the plasma membrane (Figures  1D,E ). These data indicated that indeed the C-terminal ARM repeat domain is essential and sufficient for plasma membrane-association of AtPUB43 and that this is a general feature of SAUL1-type E3 ubiquitin ligases. The analysis of transgenic Arabidopsis plants overexpressing GFP-AtPUB43ΔARM 1−6  showed that the C-terminus by itself had no effect on plant growth and development (Figure
test whether masking the N-terminus of SAUL1-type proteins, which eventually leads to patchy distribution of the protein at the plasma membrane (Drechsel et al.,  2011  and Figure  2E ), may affect growth and development, we analyzed CaMV35S::YFP-SAUL1 plants. Indeed, overexpression of YFP-SAUL1 fusion proteins resulted in a severe growth defect when compared to growth of wildtype plants (Figures  1F,G ).

SAUL1-type PUB-ARM proteins from rice are associated to the plasma membrane Recently, the PUB-ARM protein family has been described
OsPUB21, OsPUB22, OsPUB23, OsPUB24, and OsPUB25 possess an elongated C-terminus and carry an additional C-terminal ARM repeat domain like their Arabidopsis orthologs. We investigated whether the rice SAUL1 orthologs were also associated to the plasma membrane. For that purpose, GFP-OsPUB23 fusion proteins were expressed in Arabidopsis protoplasts and their fluorescence analyzed by confocal laser scanning microscopy. GFP fluorescence indicated plasma membrane-association of GFP-OsPUB23 (Figure  2A ). To confirm this localization, GFP-OsPUB23 was co-expressed with AtINT4-RFP. The AtINT4 inositol transport protein was localized to the plasma membrane as described previously (Figure  2B , c.f. Schneider et al.,  2006 ). Merging green and red fluorescence of GFP-OsPUB23 and AtINT4-RFP, respectively, clearly showed that OsPUB23 is associated to the plasma membrane (Figures  2C,D ). When isolating the cDNA clone of  OsPUB21 , we not only found the long form  OsPUB21.1 , but also recovered the truncated  OsPUB21.2  missing the additional C-terminal ARM repeat domain. Whereas GFP-OsPUB21.1 was also associated to the plasma membrane (Figure  2E ), GFP-OsPUB21.2 was not localized to the plasma membrane but to the cytoplasm (Figure  2F ). Masking the N-terminus of Os-PUB21.1 by GFP again resulted in patchy distribution at the plasma membrane (Figure  2E ). Indeed, rice SAUL1-type PUB-ARM proteins were associated to the plasma membrane and this localization was dependent on the elongated C-terminus carrying the additional ARM repeat domain.

Confocal laser scanning microscopy on transformed Arabidopsis leaf cell protoplasts and tobacco leaf epidermal cells analyzed localization of GFP fusion proteins. The poplar SAUL1-type PUB-ARM protein Pt0005s27480 (POPTR_0005s27480) localized to the plasma membrane as indicated by GFP fluorescence of GFP-Pt0005s27480 (Figure  4A ) or Pt0005s27480-GFP (not shown) fusion proteins. In contrast, the same approach showed that the poplar PUB-ARM protein Pt0004s02840 (POPTR_0004s02840) that is lacking the C-terminal ARM repeat domain was localized to cytoplasm and nucleus (Figure  4B  and not shown). The
contain the additional ARM repeat domain localized to cytoplasm and nucleus (Figures  5A,B ). To confirm localization of Pt0005s27480 and Pp1s3_414V6 at the plasma membrane, both GFP fusion proteins were co-expressed with the plasma membrane sugar transport protein UmSrt1 from the phytopathogenic fungus  Ustilago maydis  fused to RFP (Figures  4C ,  5C ). The UmSrt1 transport protein was localized to the plasma membrane as described previously (c.f. Drechsel et al.,  2011 ). Merging green and red fluorescence of GFP-Pt0005s27480 and RFP-UmSrt1 (Figure  4C ) or GFP-Pp1s3_414V6 and RFP-UmSrt1 (Figure  5C ) resulted in yellow signals and clearly showed that both SAUL1-type proteins are associated to the plasma membrane.

The amplified fragments were cloned into pENTR/D-TOPO (Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany), verified by sequencing, and recombined into destination vectors pMDC43 (Curtis and Grossniklaus,  2003 ) for GFP fusion to the N-terminus and pK7FWG2.0 (Karimi et al.,  2002 ) for fusion of GFP to the C-terminus.
