ABSTRACT:
RESULTS:
(97 %) of the GUS activity was detected in the soluble fraction, compared with 22 % when plants expressed the CPK5-16aa-GUS transgene without the G2A mutation. These results demonstrate that myristoylation is critical for the membrane binding of AtCPK5 in vivo. GFP fusions confirm plasma membrane localization of AtCPK5 To confirm the plasma membrane localization of AtCPK5, a construct containing the first 16 amino acids of AtCPK5 fused to green fluorescent protein was used for transient expression in Arabidopsis. pCPK5-16aa-GFP was bombarded into Arabidopsis leaves and expression in epidermal cells was examined by confocal microscopy (Fig.  5 ). The quantitative GUS assay data presented earlier indicated that ~80 % of AtCPK5 was plasma membrane associated and it is evident from a single optical section near the midpoint of the cell that CPK5-16aa-GFP was found at the cell periphery, corresponding to plasma membrane-localized AtCPK5 (Fig.  5 d). A maximum intensity projection indicates that fluorescence was also observed in the cytosol and nucleus, likely corresponding to soluble CPK5-16aa-GFP fusion protein (Fig.  5 c). Fluorescence in nuclei was observed routinely for all transgenic plants and was not unexpected since the sizes of free GFP (26.8 kDa) and CPK5-16aa-GFP (28.5 kDa) are below the exclusion limit of the nuclear pore complex (Grebenok et al.  1997 ). In cells expressing the non-myristoylated CPK5-G2A-GFP fusion protein, fluorescence was localized primarily in the cytosol and nucleus (Fig.  5 e, f), in a pattern similar to free GFP (Fig.  5 a, b). These data confirm that a substantial proportion of AtCPK5 is localized to the plasma membrane and that the amino-terminal glycine residue is required for membrane binding.

MATERIALS AND METHODS:
position 2 to alanine (GCC) was performed with the QuikChange Site-Directed Mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions to create pCPK5-G2A-GUS. The presence of the G2A mutation was confirmed by DNA sequencing. For constructs pCPK5-16aa-GFP and pCPK5-G2A-GFP, the GUS coding sequence in pCPK5-16aa-GUS and pCPK5-G2A-GUS was replaced with the coding sequence for soluble-modified red-shifted green fluorescent protein (smRS-GFP, Davis and Vierstra  1998 ). Plant transformation and growth conditions Arabidopsis thaliana  (ecotype Columbia) plants were transformed by the floral dip method (Clough and
in nmol min −1  mg −1 ) ranged from 1.1 × 10 4  to 1.8 × 10 4  ( n  = 7), while GUS activity from CPK5-G2A-GUS plants ranged from 1.0 × 10 3  to 2.4 × 10 3  ( n  = 6). Transient expression of AtCPK5-GFP fusion proteins p35SBSYFP (Katiyar-Agarwal et al.  2006 ), pCPK5-16aa-GFP, or pCPK5-G2A-GFP were purified using a QIAprep Spin Miniprep Kit (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA, USA). Rosette leaves (0.8–1.2 cm in length) were collected from 3- to 4-week-old Arabidopsis plants and bombarded with 0.8 μg plasmid DNA coated on 480 ug of gold particles
