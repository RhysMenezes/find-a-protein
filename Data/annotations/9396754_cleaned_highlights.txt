ABSTRACT:
In higher plant cytokinesis, plasma membrane and cell wall originate by vesicle fusion in the  plane of cell division. The  Arabidopsis KNOLLE  gene,  which is required for cytokinesis, encodes a protein related to vesicle-docking syntaxins. We have raised specific rabbit antiserum against purified recombinant  KNOLLE protein to show biochemically and by immunoelectron microscopy that KNOLLE protein is membrane associated. Using immunofluorescence microscopy, KNOLLE protein was found to be specifically  expressed during mitosis and, unlike the plasma membrane H + -ATPase, to localize to the plane of division  during cytokinesis.  Arabidopsis  dynamin-like protein  ADL1 accumulates at the plane of cell plate formation  in  knolle  mutant cells as in wild-type cells,
RESULTS:
MATERIALS AND METHODS:
for 10 min. Cell walls were partially digested with 2%  (wt/vol) driselase ( Sigma Chemical Co. , St. Louis, MO) for 30 min. The  plasma membrane was permeabilized with 0.5 or 3% Nonident P40 in  10% DMSO-MTSB for ∼1 h. Unspecific interactions were blocked with  1% (wt/vol) BSA in MTSB overnight at 4°C, and antibodies were diluted  in 3% (wt/vol) BSA in MTSB and incubated at 37°C for ∼3 h. In double-labeling experiments, the
