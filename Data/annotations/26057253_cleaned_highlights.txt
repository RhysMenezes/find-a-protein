RESULTS:
wall and in the apoplast ( Fig 3A ) and expression was also detected in the roots ( S1 Fig ). Intracellular expression of  AtLTP4 . 4 : GFP  was observed in a network, characteristic of the ER ( Fig 3B ) and  AtLTP4 . 4 : GFP  colocalized with the chloroplasts as indicated by the yellow signal ( Fig 3C ).  Arabidopsis  Col-0 transformed with the 35S:GFP vector revealed no staining around the chloroplast or the ER ( Fig 3D ).  Agrobacterium -mediated transient expression analysis of  AtLTP4 . 4 : GFP  and  AtLTP4 . 5 : GFP  in tobacco leaves confirmed the subcellular localization observed in the transgenic plants. Transient expression analysis 2 days after  Agrobacterium  infiltration showed that AtLTP4.4:GFP and AtLTP4.5:GFP were localized in the extracellular space near the cell wall ( S2 Fig ). AtLTP4.4:GFP showed stronger GFP signal than AtLTP4.5:GFP and colocalization of the AtLTP4.4:GFP protein and the chloroplasts was evident by the yellow signal ( S2B Fig ). 10.1371/journal.pone.0130204.g003 Fig 3 AtLTP4.4:GFP is localized to the cell wall/apoplast and chloroplasts in  Arabidopsis  leaves.

MATERIALS AND METHODS:
by RT-PCR and cloned into the entry vector pCR8/GW/TOPO (Invitrogen) to generate NT1618 and NT1619, respectively.  AtLTP4 . 4  and  AtLTP4 . 5  without the stop codon were cloned into the binary vector pEarleyGate 103 (BAR-35S-Gateway-GFP-His tag-OCS 3')[ 37 ] to generate NT1620 and NT1621, respectively.  Agrobacterium  (GV3101 MP90 strain) containing NT1620 and NT1621 was used to transform  Arabidopsis  [ 38 ]. Transformed seedlings were identified by plating out on MS agar media containing BASTA (25 μg/mL). Trichothecene mycotoxin Tcin, DAS, T-2, and DON were isolated and prepared as described previously [ 32 , 64 ]. Real-time PCR Quantitative Reverse Transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) using SYBR Green was used to quantify
control. Transient expression and confocal microscopy analysis Fluorescence of the lower epidermis of tobacco leaf discs was visualized with a Zeiss LSM 710 Laser Scanning Microscope (Carl Zeiss, Inc., Thornwood, NY, USA) two to three days after infiltration with AtLTP4.4:GFP and AtLTP4.5:GFP. GFP and chlorophyll were excited with a 488-nm argon laser and fluorescence was detected using 495–570 nm and 650–760 nm bandpass filters, respectively. Image data were analyzed using the ZEN 2010 software (Carl Zeiss, Inc.). Leaves from stably transformed
in each sample was calculated using a standard curve. The standard curve was linear to at least 10 μM H 2 O 2 . ROS was visualized in leaf tissue by infiltrating the cell permeable fluorescent probe 2′-7′-Dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA) using vacuum infiltration. Leaf disks were visualized with a Zeiss LSM 710 laser scanning microscope (Carl Zeiss, Inc., Thornwood, NY, USA) as described above. Treated and untreated yeast cells were stained with 2',7'-dichlorfluorescein-diacetate (DCFH-DA) for
