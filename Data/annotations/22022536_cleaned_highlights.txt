ABSTRACT:
SNARE complex-mediated vesicle fusion at the cell-division plane. However, our knowledge regarding R-SNARE components of membrane fusion machinery for cell plate formation remains quite limited. Methodology/Principal Findings We report the  in vivo  function of  Arabidopsis  VAMP721 and VAMP722, two closely sequence-related R-SNAREs, in cell plate formation.

RESULTS:
expressed respectively under the control of their native promoters in wild type (Col-0) background. Under the confocal microscope, we found that both GFP-VAMP721 and GFP-VAMP722 obviously appeared at expanding cell plates and postcytokinetic walls, which were merged with FM4-64-labeled membranes in root meristematic cells ( Figure 3A and 3C ). We also found a similar labeling pattern in cotyledon epidermal cells ( Figure S2 ). To get deep insight into the GFP-VAMP721 and GFP-VAMP722 cytokinetic localization, the root meristematic

expected, GFP-tagged VAMP722 displayed a similar cytokinetic localization pattern to GFP-VAMP721. As shown in  Figure 3D , the GFP-VAMP722 signal was apparently associated with the emerging cell plate at the division plane soon after the onset of cytokinesis. Membrane organelles labeled with GFP-VAMP722 were distributed in the vicinity of the cell plate during the process of cytokinesis. Two edges of the cell plate attached simultaneously to the parental PM at 16 min. Soon after that, the cell plate

Bars  =  10 µm. VAMP721 and VAMP722 define the trans-Golgi/early endosomal compartments Apart from the cell plate localization, we also found that GFP-VAMP721 and GFP-VAMP722 were frequently distributed to the cytoplasmic endosomes ( Figure S4 ). To define the endosomes labeled with GFP-VAMP721 and GFP-VAMP722, we first use the
GTPases and induces heterogeneous aggregations (so called BFA compartments) of early endosomal membranes in plants  [19] ,  [20] ,  [21] . When root tips were treated with 50 µM BFA plus FM4-64, the endosomes labeled with GFP-VAMP721 were induced to form aggregates that colocalized with positive BFA compartments labeled with endocytic FM4-64 ( Figure 5A ). Similar results were obtained when GFP-VAMP722-labeled root tip cells were treated with BFA ( Figure 5B ). We further found that BFA treatment induced membrane aggregates labeled with VHA-a1-GFP, a TGN/early endosome marker ( Figure 5C ). However, the Golgi marker N-ST-YFP did not enter the BFA compartments, but instead surrounded FM4-64-enriched BFA compartments ( Figure 5D ). 10.1371/journal.pone.0026129.g005 Figure 5 VAMP721- and VAMP722-labled organelles are distinct from the Golgi and PVC. (A–D) 5-d-old seedlings were pre-incubated in 50 µM BFA for 30 min before incubation in 50 µM BFA plus 5 µM FM4-64 for another 30 min. (A) and (B) GFP-VAMP721 (A) and GFP-VAMP722 (B) relocated to BFA

(F) and (G) Similar to the DMSO control, the organelles labeled with (F) GFP-VAMP721 and (G) GFP-VAMP722 were not changed following wortmannin treatment. Bars  =  10 µm. (H–K) Confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) analysis of seedling root epidermal cells co-expressing the Golgi marker N-ST-YFP or PVC marker GFP-RabF2b as indicated (green) and mCherry-VAMP721 or mCherry-VAMP722 as indicated (red). Co-localization analysis showed that mCherry-VAMP721- and mCherry-VAMP722-labeled organelles were closely associated with Golgi stacks in (H) and (J). Similarly, as shown in (I) and (K), mCherry-VAMP721- and mCherry-VAMP722-labeled organelles were also distinct from the PVC marker GFP-RabF2b. Bars  =  5 µm. To determine whether the endosomes labeled with GFP-VAMP721 and GFP-VAMP722 belong to the prevacuolar compartment (PVC)/late endosome (LE), we further used wortmannin, an inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase, which targets the PVC/LE that then dilates and blocks the traffic to vacuole in plants  [22] ,  [23] . After treatment with wortmannin at 33 µm for 60 min in the transgenic root tip cells, we observed that the PVC marker GFP-RabF2b was induced to form small vacuoles, which are the representative wortmannin treatment structures ( Figure 5E ). In contrast, wortmannin treatment did not cause visible changes of the organelles labeled with GFP-VAMP721 and GFP-VAMP722 in size or number, similar to the results in DMSO control ( Figure 5F and 5G ). In the root cells co-expressing mCherry-tagged VAMP721 and fluorescence marker of Golgi, mCherry-VAMP721-labeled organelles were in physical proximity with the Golgi marked with N-ST-YFP ( Figure 5H ). For root cells co-labeled with mCherry-VAMP721 and the PVC marker GFP-RabF2b, we found that the organelles labeled with mCherry-VAMP721 were often transiently close to, but distinct from the PVC ( Figure 5I ). Similarly, the organelles labeled with mCherry-VAMP722 were distinct from the Golgi apparatus and PVC markers ( Figure

Under the confocal microscope, we observed that mCherry-VAMP721 and VHA-a1-GFP exhibited overlapping membrane distributions ( Figure 6F ). Similarly, fluorescence signals from mCherry-VAMP722 were colocalized with those of VHA-a1-GFP ( Figure 6G ). 10.1371/journal.pone.0026129.g006 Figure 6 VAMP721- and VAMP722-labeled organelles are rapidly labeled by internalized FM4-64 and overlap the VHA-a1 TGN.

Inhibiting traffic at the trans-Golgi network affects cell plate formation ConcanamycinA (ConcA) is a membrane-permeable macrolide antibiotics that binds to the V-ATPase subunits c and inhibits
trafficking at the TGN, which affects cell plate formation in  Arabidopsis   [21] ,  [28] ,  [29] . When ConcA was applied to root tip cells, the organelles labeled with GFP-KNOLLE were clearly trapped in cytosolic aggregates ( Figure 7B  and  Figure S5 ). As expected, the ConcA treatment retarded the expansion of the cell plate labeled with GFP-KNOLLE, leading to cell wall stub, as shown in  Figure 7B . Similarly, we
induced intracellular accumulation of GFP-KNOLLE (B), GFP-VAMP721 (D), and GFP-VAMP722 (F), and prevented the cell plate formation indicated with arrowheads in (B), (D), and (F). Bars  =  5 µm. VAMP721 and VAMP722 are required for secretory trafficking to the plasma membrane The role of  de novo  secretory
cell plate in  vamp721vamp722  seedlings and their plasma membrane localization imply that VAMP721 and VAMP722 probably are involved in the secretory trafficking to the plasma membrae. In  vamp721vamp722  mutant seedlings expressing plasma membrane marker protein GFP-Lti6a, we observed an abnormal accumulation of GFP signals in the cytoplasm of root epidermal cells ( Figure 8B ). Even at a higher resolution, we did not detect colocalization between GFP-Lti6a and FM4-64 staining at the plasma membrane ( Figure 8B ). Similarly, we observed GFP signals inside aberrant intracellular compartments in  vamp721vamp722  roots expressing another PM marker, PIP2A-GFP ( Figure 8D ). In contrast, GFP-Lti6a and PIP2A-GFP showed clear PM localization overlapping with the
MATERIALS AND METHODS:
heterozygous double mutants were kindly provided by Paul Schulze-Lefert  [30] .  vamp721vamp722  double mutants were isolated from progeny of heterozygous double mutants. Primers used for mutants genotyping are listed in  Table S1 . Plants expressing N-ST-YFP, VHA-a1-GFP, GFP-RABF2b, GFP-KNOLLE and GFP-LTi6a have been described previously  [20] ,  [21] ,  [28] ,  [36] ,  [44] . For  vamp721vamp722  mutant seedlings expressing GFP-LTi6a, GFP-KNOLLE, F2 lines derived from crosses between GFP-LTi6a or GFP-KNOLLE lines and  vamp721 +/- vamp722 -/-  plants were genotyped to isolate the heterozygous double mutants containing the marker protein. For  vamp721vamp722  mutant seedlings expressing PIP2A-GFP and TIP1;1-GFP, the plasmids  PIP2A-GFP (CD3-1003) and  TIP1;1-GFP  (CD3-971)  [45]  were used to transform the heterozygous double mutants. Wild-type looking seedlings from the mother plants were used as the controls. For growing seedlings on agar-containing plates,  Arabidopsis  seeds were pretreated in 70%
and placed at 4°C in the dark for 2 d before germination. Growth conditions were at 23°C with a 16-h-light/8-h-dark cycle, either in soil or on MS plates. Constructs and plant transformation For fluorescent fusion protein constructions, 1.8kb  VAMP721  promoter and 2.0kb  VAMP722  promoter before the start codon of each gene were amplified from genomic DNA of wild-type  Arabidopsis thaliana  ecotype Columbia plants and cloned into the pCAMBIA1300 binary expression vector with  Hin dIII and  Sal I respectively. To create the translational fusions of  VAMP721  or  VAMP722  tagged with GFP or mCherry, a cloning vector  pUC18/pCAMBIA1300-GFP-AtFim1ABD2   [46]  was used.  GFP  sequence was replaced with cDNA encoding mCherry. The genomic sequences of  VAMP721  and  VAMP722  were PCR amplified and subcloned into the cloning vectors with  Spe I and  Not I replacing the  ABD2  fragment. Then the resulted cloning vectors were digested with  Sal I and  Eco RI and the  Sal I- Eco RI fragments including  GFP/mCherry-VAMP721/VAMP722  were cloned into the pCAMBIA1300 under  VAMP721  or  VAMP722  promoter. Primer sequences used for the constructs are listed in  Table S1 . All The sequences cloned above were checked by sequencing. The binary
performed by floral dipping using  Agrobacterium tumefaciens   [47] . The selection of transgenic lines was performed on 1/2 MS solid medium containing 3% sucrose with 25ug/ml hygromycin. For complementation the resulting  A.tumefaciens  transformant  pVAMP721::GFP-VAMP721  was used to transform  vamp721 -/-  vamp722 +/-  plants. The homozygous identity of T-DNA insertion of the rescued plants was confirmed by PCR assay in the T2 plants. RT-PCR analysis Total RNA was extracted from
an Argon laser at 488 nm and detected with a 505- to 550-nm emission filter. For imaging of GFP/FM4-64, YFP/FM4-64, or GFP/chlorophyll, the signals were excited with an Argon laser at 488nm and detected with a spectral detector set BP 500-550 IR for green signal and LP 560 for red signal. Co-localization analyses were performed on F1 or F2 hybrid seedlings co-expressing GFP- and mCherry-tagged proteins under Zeiss LSM 5 LIVE. GFP and mCherry were excited with a 488-nm and 561-nm laser respectively (multitrack mode). The fluorescence emission was detected with spectral detector set BP 520-555 (GFP) and LP 575 (mCherry). To image propidium iodide and Calcofluor simultaneously by Zeiss LSM 5 LIVE, the parameter set was used as described  [25] .
