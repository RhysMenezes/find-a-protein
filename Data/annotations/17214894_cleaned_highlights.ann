T17	Irrelevant 867 1049	Based on analysis of both T-DNA insertion mutants and transgenic overexpression lines, stress-induced WRKY25 functions as a negative regulator of SA-mediated defense responses to  P.
T18	Irrelevant 1061 1251	transcription factor, it is likely to be localized in the nucleus. The presence of putative nuclear localization signal predicted by the PSORT II program is consistent with this possibility.
T19	Irrelevant 1715 1857	Expression of  WRKY25 A possible role for WRKY25 during defense signaling was further investigated by analyzing its expression in  Arabidopsis
T20	Irrelevant 1883 2501	indicated. Transcripts for  PR1  were detected using a  PR1  fragment generated from PCR amplification using two  PR1 -specific oligonucleotides as primers (5'-TTCTTCCCTCGAAAGCTCAA-3' and 5'-CGTTCACATAATTCCCACGA-3'). Production of recombinant WRKY25 protein and electrophoresis mobility shift assay (EMSA) To generate the WRKY25 recombinant protein, its full-length cDNA was amplified using two gene-specific primers (5'-ATCGAATTCATGGACAATAGCAGAAC-3' and 5'-ATCCTCGAGTGAGGGCATAAACGAAT-3'). The amplified DNA fragment was digested with EcoR1 and Xho1, cloned into the same sites of pET32a (Novagen) and transformed into

Pchn5 and the mutant mPchn5 probes were labeled to specific activities of approximately 10 5  cpm/ng using the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I. Sequence-specific DNA binding was assayed with EMSA essentially as described previously [ 12 ]. Binding reactions contained 12 μl nuclear extraction buffer, 5 μg poly(dIdC), 1 μg proteins and 2 ng of labeled double-stranded oligo DNA. DNA and protein complexes were allowed to form at room
