ABSTRACT:
Members of the P4 subfamily of P-type ATPases are thought to create and maintain lipid asymmetry in biological membranes by flipping specific lipids between membrane leaflets. In Arabidopsis, 7 of the 12  A minophospho l ipid  A TPase (ALA) family members are expressed in pollen. Here we show that double knockout of ALA6 and ALA7 ( ala6/7 ) results in siliques with
present in acyl side chains. A change in the properties of the  ala6/7  plasma membrane was also indicated by a ~10-fold reduction of labeling by lipophilic FM-dyes relative to wild-type. Together, these results indicate that ALA6 and ALA7 provide redundant activities that function to directly or indirectly change the distribution and abundance of lipids
RESULTS:
Figure 5 Confocal fluorescence micrographs showing GFP-ALA6 localizes to the pollen tube perimeter and endomembrane structures .  (A,B)  Growing pollen tubes expressing  (A)  YFP (ss1919) as a marker for the cytosol and  (B)  ACA9-YFP (ss471-472) as a marker for the plasma membrane (Myers et al.,  2009 ).  (C,D)  Pollen tubes expressing GFP-ALA6 (ss1880) either  (C)  treated with 0.05% NaAz, or  (D)  growing. Constructs were expressed under the control of the ACA9 promoter in stable
MATERIALS AND METHODS:
Confocal microscopy Images were collected using an Olympus IX81 FV1000 confocal microscope run by the Olympus FluoView 1.07.03.00 software package (Olympus, Center Valley, PA). A 60× objective (numerical aperture 1.42) was used throughout. Excitation at wavelengths of 488 nm (GFP, FM4-64, and FM1-43) and 515 nm (YFP) was provided with an Argon-Ion laser. A spectral emission range of 500–600 nm was used for
water. Lipid samples were then evaporated to 1 mL and sent to the Kansas Lipidomics Research Center ( http://www.k-state.edu/lipid/lipidomics ) for routine plant polar lipid analysis by tandem mass spectrometry. The two mass spectrometers used were an Applied Biosystems API 4000 and an Applied Biosystems Q-TRAP, separated by a collision cell. Samples were introduced by electrospray ionization, with no pre-analysis separation. Analysis was done using both precursor and neutral loss scans. Lipid
