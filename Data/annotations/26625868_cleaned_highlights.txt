ABSTRACT:
level of  bHLH129  was reduced in response to exogenously applied ABA, and elevated in the ABA biosynthesis mutant  aba1-5 . Florescence observation of transgenic plants expressing  bHLH129-GFP  showed that bHLH129 was localized in the nucleus, and transient expression of  bHLH129  in protoplasts inhibited reporter gene expression. When expressed in Arabidopsis under the control of the  35S  promoter,  bHLH129  promoted root elongation, and the transgenic plants were less sensitivity
RESULTS:
 transgenic plants (see next section for details), suggesting that the bHLH129-GFP was functional. By examining GFP florescence in the root of the  bHLH129-GFP  transgenic plant seedlings obtained, we found that bHLH129 is predominantly localized in the nucleus ( Fig. 3B ). We then examined transcriptional activities of bHLH129 using protoplast transient transfection assays. Plasmids of activator gene  LD-VP , effector
MATERIALS AND METHODS:
plant transformation and protoplasts isolation. The  bhlh129-1  mutant was isolated from a SALK T-DNA insertion line (SALK_041780) obtained from ABRC. To obtain seedlings for phenotypic analysis and ABA treatment, Arabidopsis seeds were sterilized and sown on ½ MS (Murashige & Skoog) plates with vitamins (PlantMedia) and 1% (w/v) sucrose, solidified with 0.6% (w/v) phytoagar (PlantMedia). The plates were kept
vector under the control of the  35S  promoter 44 45 . HA tagged bHLH129 construct in  pUC19  was then digested with proper enzymes, and subcloned into the binary vector  pPZP211 46 . To generate GFP tagged construct for subcellular localization analysis of bHLH129, the ORF of  bHLH129  was amplified and cloned in frame with a C-terminal GFP tag into the  pUC19 , the construct obtained was then digested with proper enzymes, and subcloned into the binary vector  pPZP211  for plant transformation. To generate  bHLH129p:GUS  ( β-glucuronidase ) construct for plant transformation, a 2514 bp DNA fragment immediately before the start condon of  bHLH129  was amplified by PCR using DNA isolated from Arabidopsis seedlings, and used to replace the  OFP1  promoter in the  pPZP211OFP1p:GUS  construct 43 . The primers used to generate  GD/HA-bHLH129  construct are 5′-CAACATATGTACCCTCCTAATTCCTC-3′ and 5′-CAAGAGCTCTCATCGCTTCTTGCATGC-3′, the primers used to generate  bHLH129-GFP  construct are 5′-CAACATATGTACCCTCCTAATTCCTC-3′ and 5′-CAAGAGCTCTCGCTTCTTGCATGC-3′, and the primers used for make  bHLH129p:GUS  construct are 5′-CAACTGCAGCATGATCGGTCTGATTC-3′ and 5′-CAAGAGCTCGAAACCGGAAAAGAAAAACCC-3′.
