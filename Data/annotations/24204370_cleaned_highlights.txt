ABSTRACT:
oxide (NO) homeostasis. GSNOR-encoding genes are known to have high homology across diverse eukaryotic taxa, but contributions of specific conserved residues have not been assessed. With bioinformatics and structural modeling, we show that plant GSNORs likely localize to the cytosol, contain conserved, solvent-accessible cysteines, and tend to be encoded by a single gene.  Arabidopsis thaliana  homozygous for  GSNOR  loss-of-function alleles exhibited defects in stem and trichome branching, and complementation with Green fluorescent protein (GFP) -tagged
the native promoter quantitatively rescued these phenotypes. GSNOR-GFP showed fluorescence throughout Arabidopsis seedlings, consistent with ubiquitous expression of the protein, but with especially high fluorescence in the root tip, apical meristem, and flowers. At the cellular level we observed cytosolic and nuclear fluorescence, with exclusion from the nucleolus. Microarray analysis identified 99 up- and 170 down-regulated genes (≥2-fold;  p  ≤ 0.01) in a GSNOR null mutant compared to wild type. Six members of the plant specific, ROXY glutaredoxins and

This is also evident in the elongating zone of the root, although nucleoli are considerably smaller in these cells (Figure  4H ). GSNOR-GFP could also be detected in anther filaments, ovary,
MATERIALS AND METHODS:
day/night temperature cycle. For analysis of the number of branches produced by wild-type and mutant plants, plants were grown as above and their height and branch pattern and numbers were measured 8 weeks after germination. Generation and visualization of GSNOR-GFP fusions in plants Green fluorescent protein (GFP) was fused in frame 3′ to the Arabidopsis  GSNOR  genomic DNA (including 754 bp and 180 bp of 5′ and 3′ UTR, respectively) as follows. Genomic DNA was cloned into pENTR/D TOPO (Life Technologies). GFP was obtained from pMDC83 (Curtis and Grossniklaus,  2003 ).  Hind III and  Xba I sites were added to GFP and GSNOR-encoding sequences with primers GGATGCAAGCTTAGTAAAGGAGAAGAAC and TCTCTAGATTATTTGTATAGTTCATCCATGC (GFP) and primers CGTTGTG TCCTCGATACCAGCAAGCTTGTCTCTAGATGACTATATGGGTCCTCTCTGC and GCAGAGAGGACCCATATAGTCATCTAGAGACAAGCTTGCTGGTATCGAGGAC ACAACG (GSNOR). PCR products were digested with  Hind III and  Xba I, purified, and ligated. The GSNOR-GFP clone was then subjected to PCR with primers GGTACCGAA TTCCTAGAGTACAACCTC and TCGAGTGCGGCCGCTAAACT ATATGATTAG to add  Eco RI and  Not I sites, respectively. The PCR product was then ligated into  Eco RI/ Not I-digested pENTR2B. Constructs were cloned into the binary vector pBIB Basta-GWR (Gou et al.,  2010 ) with LR Clonase II (Invitrogen), after which the sequence was verified. The GSNOR-GFP translational fusion was then transformed into  hot5-2  plants, and homozygous transformants were identified by Basta screening and western blots. Three independent transgenic lines were analyzed. Whole seedlings and roots were imaged 7 days after germination on minimal
