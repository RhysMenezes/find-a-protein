ABSTRACT:
( At TSPO:eGFP). The location of the  At TSPO:eGFP fusion protein was found to depend on the translational start position and the conditions under which plants were grown. Full-length  At TSPO:eGFP fusion protein was found in the endoplasmic reticulum and in vesicles of unknown identity when plants were grown in standard conditions. However, full length  At TSPO:eGFP localized to chloroplasts when grown in the presence of 150 mM NaCl, conditions of salt stress. In contrast, when 
carotenoid biosynthesis inhibitors also affect  AtTSPO  expression. Conclusion Our data suggest that AtTSPO plays a role in the response of  Arabidopsis  to high salt stress. Salt stress leads to re-localization of the AtTSPO from the ER to chloroplasts through its N-terminal extension. In addition, our results show that  AtTSPO  is regulated at the transcriptional level in tetrapyrrole biosynthetic mutants. Thus, we propose that  At TSPO may play a role in transporting tetrapyrrole
RESULTS:
expression of photosynthetic genes in  R. sphaeroides  [ 16 ], we hypothesized that  tspo-1  or OxM1TSPO:eGFP mutants might have an impaired salt stress response. We examined the expression of some well-known salt stress-regulated genes (RAB18, ERD10 and DREB2A) [ 26 ]. As expected, stress marker genes were induced by 150 mM NaCl in wild-type plants
no significant change ERD10 expression was observed (Figure  3A, B  and  3C ). Figure 3 Stress-response genes are up-regulated in  tspo-1  during salt stress . ( A )-( C ) Stress-induced gene expression in OxM1TSPO:eGFP and  tspo-1
the roles of the N-terminal extension in targeting  AtTSPO  within the cell. Past studies [ 20 , 23 ] have utilized N-terminal GFP fusions that might block potential organellar targeting of  At TSPO, particularly mitochondrial or plastid localization. To allow proper targeting of  At TSPO fusions to GFP,  AtTSPO  was placed on the N-terminus of GFP. Three constructs were made, representing each of the potential start codons M1 (OxM1TSPO:eGFP), M21 (OxM21TSPO:eGFP) and M42 (OxM42TSPO:eGFP) and expressed from the CaMV 35S promoter in  Arabidopsis . At TSPO:eGFP subcellular localization was observed in root, hypocotyls and cotyledons of these lines by confocal microscopy. Full-length  At TSPO:eGFP (OxM1TSPO:eGFP) was found in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of the root tip (Figure  6A ) and cotyledons (Figure  6C ) in five day-old seedlings. However, in the hypocotyls of these plants, the fusion protein was found in the ER and in vesicles of unknown identity (Figure  6B ). When M21 (OxM21TSPO:eGFP) or M42 (OxM42TSPO:eGFP) were used, the fusion proteins always co-localized with mitotracker, indicating a mitochondrial localization (Figure  6D, E, F, G, H  and 
post-translational control. Figure 6 At TSPO has different sub-cellular location depending on the translational start site used . Confocal images of OxM1TSPO:eGFP ( A-C ), OxM21TSPO:eGFP ( D-F ) and OxM42TSPO:eGFP ( G-I ) localization. OxM1TSPO:eGFP localizes in the ER and vesicles of unknown function in the root ( A ), hypocotyl ( B ) and cotyledon ( C ).

Homozygous transgenic plants harboring 35S-TSPO:eGFP in wild-type background were used for the analysis. Scale bars = 50 μm. OxM1TSPOeGFP becomes associated with plastids following high salt stress Having established a key role for  At TSPO in response to abiotic stress, we next examined the localization of  At TSPO:eGFP fusion proteins in plants subjected to various stress conditions. 5 day-old seedlings were treated with 250 mM mannitol, 1 μM ABA, 0.2 μM MV and 150 mM NaCl. After 18 hours of treatment, OxM1TSPO:eGFP became localized to the plastid (Figure  7G, H, I, J, K  and  7L ), while neither OxM21TSPO:eGFP nor OxM42TSPO:eGFP had altered localization even with 5 day extended NaCl treatment (data not shown).  At TSPO:GFP localization did not change when plants were treated with mannitol, ABA or MV (data not shown). Figure 7 OxM1TSPOeGFP localizes in chloroplasts upon salt stress . ( A-F ) Confocal analyses show OxM1TSPO:eGFP localization in the ER and vesicles of unknown function in hypocotyls of 5-day-old seedlings grown in the standard conditions.

To confirm the location of  At TSPO we performed protease protection assays on isolated chloroplasts from OxM1TSPO:eGFP lines that were grown with or without 150 mM NaCl treatment.
