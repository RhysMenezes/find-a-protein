ABSTRACT:
RESULTS:
fusion construct the same subnuclear localization was seen in aboveground tissues and in roots. The localization was documented in roots ( Figure 2 ) as visualization of the GFP signal was better in cells without chlorophyll. Plants expressing the SUVR1a-GFP splice variant showed a strong GFP signal in the nucleolus and a very weak signal in the nucleoplasm ( Figure 2A ). In DAPI-stained nuclei, the nucleolus appears as a black hole ( Figure 2A , left, arrow). FISH, performed with a probe against the
, insert). In plants transformed with the SUVR1b-GFP construct, strong GFP expression was in contrast detected in the nucleoplasm, and the protein was excluded from the nucleolus and the densely DAPI-stained heterochromatin ( Figure 2B ). The differences in subnuclear localization between the two splice variants indicate that SUVR1 distribution is regulated by alternative splicing. SUVR2a-GFP expression was mainly seen in subdomains associated with or within the nucleolus, and a weaker signal was present in the nucleoplasm ( Figure 2C ). Additionally, a variable number of nuclear bodies of unequal size were observed in SUVR2a-GFP expressing cells, suggesting specific association with subnuclear regions. Notably, these nuclear bodies showed weaker DAPI staining than the rest of the nucleoplasm, and did not overlap with the DAPI-stained chromocenters. Like SUVR1a-GFP, SUVR4a-GFP displayed a very specific localization, with uniform expression in the whole nucleolus in most of the nuclei investigated and much weaker expression in the nucleoplasm ( Figure 2D ). However, in some nucleoli the GFP signal was not covering
intermediate of the two preceding situations. In these nuclei, GFP was observed in the whole nucleolus, with a stronger signal in a spot at the edge of the nucleolus ( Figure 2E ). A short amino acid sequence from SUVR1 can function as a nucleolus localization signal Putative
acids of SUVR4 including the NLS (pK7WGF2-S4-NLS) and (iv) SUVR4 without the terminal NLS (pK7WGF2-S4-1535) (cfr.  Figure 1C ). Roots from  Arabidopsis  plants transformed with these constructs were inspected for subcellular and subnuclear localization of the GFP signal. GFP was not found in the cytoplasm for any of the constructs. The 176 amino acid fragment (data not shown) and also the 40 amino acid fragment of SUVR1a could direct GFP to the nucleolus ( Figure 2F ), confirming that the difference in subnuclear localization between the SUVR1a and SUVR1b proteins was due to sequences in the unique N-terminus of the SUVR1a splice variant. NLS2, on the other hand, is
to the nucleolus, but the GFP signal was in addition seen in the nucleoplasm ( Figure 2G ). In the nucleolus a stronger signal was usually present in a distinct spot, as also seen in some nuclei expressing the SUVR4a-GFP fusion protein ( Figure 2E ). The signal from GFP-SUVR4 devoid of the terminal NLS was also found localized in such spots, however also in distinct spots in the nucleoplasm ( Figure 2H ). Thus, this NLS plays a role in the subnuclear localization of SUVR4, although other parts
MATERIALS AND METHODS:
were run without Reverse Transcriptase. DNA constructs A fragment containing the C.1 Gateway cassette (Invitrogen) and the smRS-green fluorescent protein (GFP) was isolated from the pKGAW-smRSGFP vector ( 21 ), and ligated into the XhoI digested and blunted glucocorticoid-inducible pTA7002 vector ( 22 ) to create the pTA7002GWsmRSGFP vector. The SUVR CDS were amplified from mRNA from flowers and buds, with the following Gateway primers: splice variant  SUVR1a —5′-attB1-ATATGAGAATAACTGGGATTTCATTG and 5′-attB2-CTTTGTTCAAAATCTGCATGG (SUVR1 GAW R); splice variant  SUVR1b —5′-attB1-ATATGGATGAAGATGAATTTCCATTG and SUVR1 GAW R; splice variant  SUVR4a —5′-attB1-ACGACGCAGTGAAACAGAGA and 5′-attB2-ATTTGCGCTTTTTAGACACCTC; and splice variant  SUVR2a —5′-attB1-AATTTCACCTGGCACTGTCC and 5′-attB2-ATGCTCGCTTCTTCACATTC. The CDS were recombined by Gateway technology first into pDONR207, and then into pTA7002GWsmRSGFP to give the pTA7002-SUVR1a-GFP, pTA7002-SUVR1b-GFP, pTA7002-SUVR4a-GFP and pTA7002-SUVR2a-GFP constructs, respectively. SUVR fragments generated to identify nucleolar localization signals were PCR amplified from sequenced full-length clones using the following Gateway primers: S1-187—5′-attB1-AATCTAGAATATGAGAATAACTGGGATTTCATTG and 5′-attB2-TTATGCTACACTTTCCTCTGGACTTC; S1-295—5′-attB1-AATCTAGAATATGAGAATAACTGGGATTTCATTG and 5′-attB2-TTATCCACGTCTACTGCGCAAC; S4-1535—5′-attB1-GTATGATCAGTCTCTCCGGACT and 5′-attB2-TTAGCCTTGAGATCCTTTTATTTTTCTG; and S4-NLS—5′-attB1-TCATTTGCGCTTTTTAGACACCTC and 5′-attB2-CTCAAGGCAAGTCTATAG. The PCR products were recombined into pDONR/Zeo and subsequently in frame with an N-terminal EGFP gene in the Gateway destination vector pK7WGF2 ( 23 ). HMTase and GST pull-down constructs were generated as follows: the  SUVR1  SACSET sequence, which include the pre-SET, SET and post-SET domains, was PCR amplified with Pfx (Invitrogen)
Columbia, were grown under long day greenhouse conditions at 20°C. Transgenic  Arabidopsis  plants were generated by the floral dip method ( 24 ), using the  Agrobacterium tumefaciens  strain C58 pCV2260. Transgenic plants containing glucocorticoid inducible pTA7002-SUVR-smRSGFP constructs were selected on MS-2 medium (1× Murashige and Skoog salts, 0.05% 2-N-morpholino/ethanesulfonic acid, 2% sucrose, 0.8% agar) containing 15 μg/ml hygromycin. SUVR-GFP expression was induced by growing transgenic plants on agar plates containing 5 μM dexamethasone ( 22 ). Plants containing the pK7WGF2 constructs were selected on MS-2 containing 50 μg/ml kanamycin. FISH and documentation of GFP localization Roots of transgenic plants that expressed GFP-fusion proteins were chopped and fixed in 4% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) on a glass slide, covered with cover slip and squashed. After freezing in liquid N 2 , the cover slip was removed, and the glass slide was transferred to PBS. FISH was performed as described previously ( 25 ) on young rosette leaves expressing SUVR1-GFP. The 18S rDNA probe was PCR amplified using the primers 5′-CTGCCCGTTGCTCTGATGATTCATG and 5′-CAATAAAGACCAGGAGCGTATCG and then subcloned into the pGEM vector. The probe was then DIG labelled by PCR with the DIG labelling kit (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim). A total of
conjugated rabbit anti-sheep antibody (1:100, Abcam). Immunodetection of GFP was done as described ( 18 ) using a mouse-anti-GFP antibody (1:50, Molecular Probes) followed by an Alexa 488 conjugated goat-anti-mouse antibody (1:100, Molecular Probes). All preparations were counterstained in DAPI (2 μg/ml) and inspected with a Zeiss Axiovision2 microscope equipped with epifluorescence attachment. Protein expression, GST pull-down and
