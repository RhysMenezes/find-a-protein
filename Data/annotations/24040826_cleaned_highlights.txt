ABSTRACT:
trigger of unfolded protein response (UPR). Over-expression of AtTCTP significantly decreased cell death in tobacco leaf discs in both studies. A  45 Ca overlay assay showed AtTCTP to be a Ca 2+ -binding protein and localization experiments revealed cytosolic distribution of AtTCTP-GFP in  Arabidopsis  seedlings. Conclusions Our study showed cytoprotective effects of plant TCTP for the first time. Furthermore, we showed the ability of AtTCTP to bind to Ca 2+  and its cytosolic distribution within the cell. If these results are combined, two putative modes of action can be assumed: 1) AtTCTP acts as Ca 2+  sequester, preventing PCD by reducing cytosolic Ca 2+  levels as described for animals. 2) AtTCTP could directly or indirectly interact with other cytosolic or membrane-bound proteins of the cell death machinery, thereby inhibiting cell death progression. As no homologous proteins of the anti-apoptotic machinery of animals were found in plants, and functional homologues still
RESULTS:
45 Ca 2+ . Different amounts of AtTCTP-StrepII were tested: 0.25, 0.5, and 1 μg protein were spotted onto PVDF membrane, in order to show increased Ca 2+ -binding. Following  45 Ca overlay assay, spotted proteins were stained using Coomassie brilliant blue (see Figure  3 C). Figure 3 45 Ca overlay assay of recombinant AtTCTP.  Ca 2+ -binding
bovine serum albumin (BSA), and controls C1 (10 μl purified crude extract without StrepII-tag protein expression) and C2 (non Ca 2+ -binding, StrepII-tagged  A. thaliana  protein kinase).  C  shows Coomassie brilliant blue staining of the PVDF membrane used in 3B. If not indicated differently, 0.25 μg of each protein were spotted for  45 Ca overlay assay. Localization of AtTCTP in  Arabidopsis thaliana Stably transformed, seven to eight days old  A. thaliana  seedlings expressing  AtTCTP::GFP  under the control of a CaMV 35S promoter were used to investigate cellular localization of AtTCTP. Leaf epidermal cells showed cytosolic distribution of AtTCTP-GFP (see Figure  4 A, B). The functionality of AtTCTP-GFP was tested in tunicamycin and BAX experiments, revealing the same cytoprotective function as AtTCTP (see Additional file  1 : Figure S1). Therefore AtTCTP-GFP was assumed to
MATERIALS AND METHODS:
Methods Vector construction In order to generate AtTCTP (At3g16640; GenBank: AEE75847.1) and AtTCTP-GFP expressing vectors  AtTCTP  and  AtTCTP::GFP  were ligated into Gateway compatible vector pXCSG containing the constitutive 35S promoter of cauliflower mosaic virus and a C-terminal StrepII-tag [ 38 ], resulting in pXCSG- AtTCTP  and pXCSG- AtTCTP::GFP . Therefore, total RNA was extracted from  Arabidopsis thaliana  using TRI-reagent according to manufacturers’ instructions (Sigma). Residual genomic DNA was removed by RNase-free DNase treatment (Fermentas, #EN0521) and first-strand cDNA was synthesized using 1 μg of total RNA, an anchored oligo(d)T primer-mix, and M-MuLV Reverse Transcriptase (Fermentas, RevertAid #EP0441) according to the suppliers protocol. The following primers were used in a 2-step protocol to design  attB-AtTCTP  and  attB-AtTCTP::GFP  using Phusion High-Fidelity DNA polymerase (Thermo Scientific, #F530S): attB1-adapter: 5′-GGGGACAAGTTTGTACAAAAAAGCAGGCTTC-3′; attB2-adapter: 5′-GGGGACCACTTTGTACAAGAAAGCTGGGT-3′; attB1-AtTCTP: 5′-AAAAAGCAGGCTTCATGTTGGTGTACCAAGATCT-3′; attB2-AtTCTP: 5′-GAAAGCTGGGTCGCACTTGACCTCCTTCA-3′; attB2-GFP: 5′-GAAAGCTGGGTGGCCTCGTCCATCTG-3′. Gateway cloning was performed using Gateway BP and LR Clonase® Mix II from Invitrogen. Dr. Maki Kawai-Yamada kindly provided the dexamethason (DEX) inducible expression vectors for BAX (GenBank: NP_031553.1; vector: pTA7002- Bax ) and ΔCBax (pTA7002- ΔCBax )
5 ml infiltration buffer (10 mM MES-KOH pH 5.6, 10 mM MgCl 2 , and 150 μM acetosyringone). Concentration of bacterial suspensions was photometrically determined (OD 600 ); suspensions were mixed to adjust final concentrations: OD 600  = 0.5 for  Agrobacterium  carrying AtTCTP, AtTCTP-GFP, BAX, ΔCBAX, or StrepII expressing plasmids; OD 600  = 0.25 for P19 repressor. These suspensions were incubated for two hours at room temperature under continuous shaking, followed by infiltration into four weeks old tobacco leaves using a 1 ml syringe without
a 24-well tissue culture plate. DMSO without any additions was used for control conditions. A top cover prevented evaporation and plates were placed under a luminous field (16 hours light, 8 hours darkness; 23°C) during incubation. An electrical conductivity meter (Horiba B-173, Japan) was used to measure
