T31	Irrelevant 5006 6362	Columbia, were grown under long day greenhouse conditions at 20°C. Transgenic  Arabidopsis  plants were generated by the floral dip method ( 24 ), using the  Agrobacterium tumefaciens  strain C58 pCV2260. Transgenic plants containing glucocorticoid inducible pTA7002-SUVR-smRSGFP constructs were selected on MS-2 medium (1× Murashige and Skoog salts, 0.05% 2-N-morpholino/ethanesulfonic acid, 2% sucrose, 0.8% agar) containing 15 μg/ml hygromycin. SUVR-GFP expression was induced by growing transgenic plants on agar plates containing 5 μM dexamethasone ( 22 ). Plants containing the pK7WGF2 constructs were selected on MS-2 containing 50 μg/ml kanamycin. FISH and documentation of GFP localization Roots of transgenic plants that expressed GFP-fusion proteins were chopped and fixed in 4% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) on a glass slide, covered with cover slip and squashed. After freezing in liquid N 2 , the cover slip was removed, and the glass slide was transferred to PBS. FISH was performed as described previously ( 25 ) on young rosette leaves expressing SUVR1-GFP. The 18S rDNA probe was PCR amplified using the primers 5′-CTGCCCGTTGCTCTGATGATTCATG and 5′-CAATAAAGACCAGGAGCGTATCG and then subcloned into the pGEM vector. The probe was then DIG labelled by PCR with the DIG labelling kit (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim). A total of
T32	Irrelevant 4168 5004	SUVR fragments generated to identify nucleolar localization signals were PCR amplified from sequenced full-length clones using the following Gateway primers: S1-187—5′-attB1-AATCTAGAATATGAGAATAACTGGGATTTCATTG and 5′-attB2-TTATGCTACACTTTCCTCTGGACTTC; S1-295—5′-attB1-AATCTAGAATATGAGAATAACTGGGATTTCATTG and 5′-attB2-TTATCCACGTCTACTGCGCAAC; S4-1535—5′-attB1-GTATGATCAGTCTCTCCGGACT and 5′-attB2-TTAGCCTTGAGATCCTTTTATTTTTCTG; and S4-NLS—5′-attB1-TCATTTGCGCTTTTTAGACACCTC and 5′-attB2-CTCAAGGCAAGTCTATAG. The PCR products were recombined into pDONR/Zeo and subsequently in frame with an N-terminal EGFP gene in the Gateway destination vector pK7WGF2 ( 23 ). HMTase and GST pull-down constructs were generated as follows: the  SUVR1  SACSET sequence, which include the pre-SET, SET and post-SET domains, was PCR amplified with Pfx (Invitrogen)
