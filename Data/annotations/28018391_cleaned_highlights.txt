ABSTRACT:
excess light. During chloroplast senescence carotenoids are released from their binding proteins and are eventually metabolized. Carotenoid cleavage dioxygenase 4 (CCD4) is involved in carotenoid breakdown in senescing leaf and desiccating seed, and is part of the proteome of plastoglobules (PG), which are thylakoid-associated lipid droplets. Here, we demonstrate that CCD4 is functionally active in PG. Leaves of  Arabidopsis thaliana ccd4  mutants constitutively expressing CCD4 fused to yellow fluorescent protein showed strong fluorescence in PG and reduced carotenoid levels upon dark-induced
RESULTS:
to the removal of the transit peptide and unlike pCCD4 was resistant to thermolysin protease.  (B)  Colocalization of CCD4-YFP and FBN1a-CFP in isolated protoplasts of  Arabidopsis thaliana .  (C)  Isolation of PG by chloroplast membrane fractionation on a discontinuous sucrose gradient (PG, plastoglobules; Env, envelopes; Thyl, thylakoids). Pure PG fractions (nos. 1 and 2) contain recombinant CCD4-YFP. Tic40, FBN1a and LHCBII are envelope, PG and thylakoid markers, respectively. +, positive control which corresponds to a membrane fraction containing all four markers. Subcellular localization of CCD4 was analyzed by confocal microscopy of protoplasts prepared from  A. thaliana ccd4-2  mutants complemented with CCD4-YFP (yellow fluorescent protein), which were subsequently transformed with a construct encoding FBN1a-CFP
the chloroplast envelope membranes, and FBN1a (also known as PGL35) a well-accepted marker for PG ( Lundquist et al., 2012 ). Pure PG, as supported by the presence of FBN1a and the absence of Tic40 and LHCBII, contained the CCD4-YFP fusion protein (detected
MATERIALS AND METHODS:
in  CCD4  (At4g19170) gene were obtained from the European  Arabidopsis  Stock Centre ( Scholl et al., 2000 ). Seeds were surface sterilized (0.05% v/v Triton X-100, 70% v/v ethanol) and sowed on solidified ½ 12 MS (Murashige and Skoog) medium
Clonase ®  II Enzyme Mix, Invitrogen), namely p0GWA bacterial expression vector ( Busso et al., 2005 ) and pEarleyGate101 plant expression vector ( Earley et al., 2006 ). Respectively, the constructs obtained were  T7:CCD4-6xHIS  and  35S:CCD4-YFP-HA . Complementation of  ccd4  with 35S:CCD4-YFP-HA The pEarlyGate101-CCD4 construct was introduced by electroporation into the  Agrobacterium tumefaciens  C58 strain. Flowering  A. thaliana  of  ccd4  ( ccd4-2  and  ccd4-4)  was transformed with pEarlyGate101-CCD4 construct using the floral
Clough and Bent, 1998 ). Complemented plants were named 35S:CCD4.2 or 35S:CCD4.4 according to the mutant background in which the transgene was expressed ( ccd4-2  or  ccd4-4 , respectively). Transgenic plants were selected on solidified ½ 12 MS medium supplemented with 30 mg/L of glufosinate ammonium. Segregation analyses were carried out to select lines with a single insertion of the transgene. RNA Extraction, cDNA Synthesis, and
Primers for actin were obtained from Qiagen (Act2 QT00774634) and those for CCD4 were designed as published elsewhere ( Gonzalez-Jorge et al., 2013 ). Transformed Protoplasts Observed by Confocal Microscopy Plants were grown for 3 weeks on ½ 12 MS supplemented with 1% sucrose. For colocalization with CCD4-YFP, the vector pCL62 carrying  FBN1a  in frame with  CFP  was used ( Vidi et al., 2006 ). Protoplasts were isolated and transformed as described ( Jin et al., 2001 ). Fluorescence in protoplasts was monitored 30 h after transformation with a
