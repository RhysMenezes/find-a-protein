ABSTRACT:
RESULTS:
 SEP3  upstream region was used, correct spatial and temporal expression was obtained when also the  SEP3  intron sequences were included (Figure  4 ). The  gSEP3:GFP  (pARC423) expression is predominantly visible in the nuclei of the floral meristem cells of floral buds from stage 3 onwards (comprising whorl 2, 3, and 4), while there is no or minimal expression in the rest of the
(A)  gAG:GFP  (pARC422) and (B)  gSEP3:GFP  (pARC423) in the inflorescence. Top view (A, B) of an inflorescence with different floral bud stages (indicated by numbers). The GFP expression (green signal) is predominantly localized in the nuclei of floral meristem cells of flower buds from stage 3 onwards (comprising whorl 3 and 4 for AG, and whorl 2, 3, and 4 for SEP3, respectively). Autofluorescence is visible as red signal. (C) Anti-GFP Western blot with material
protein detection and chromatin affinity purification To investigate whether the ChAP procedure using tags is feasible we used transgenic Arabidopsis plants expressing  gAG:GFP  (pARC422) as example. Correct spatial and temporal AG expression was observed, predominantly in the nuclei of the floral meristem cells of floral buds from stage 3 onwards (comprising whorl 3 and 4) (Figure  4A ). First, we analyzed the  gAG:GFP  (pARC422) plants by Western blotting to see whether the chimeric AG protein is detectable with a polyclonal GFP antibody. For this, protein was isolated from nuclei extracts from wild type Arabidopsis (Col-0) plants and compared with extracts from  gAG:GFP  plants. The Western blot (Figure  4C ) shows a specific band of the expected size in the  gAG:GFP  plants, which was
MATERIALS AND METHODS:
upstream of the ATG was amplified with specific primers (PRO117 5'-CACCGGCGCGCCATCCATCCATCCAAATGGGACC-3' and PRO118 5'-GAAGCTTTTTCTTTTTCTTTCTCCTCTCCC-3') and recombined with the Gateway™ Technology in pENTR/D-TOPO (Invitrogen), followed by recombination in the binary vector pBGWFS7 [ 30 ], resulting in a transcriptional  eGFP-GUS  fusion construct (pARC213). Genomic fragments for  AG  (6882 bp),  SEP3  (3489 bp), and  FUL  (5298 bp) were amplified with gene specific primers, a forward primer located in the upstream region, PRO433 
gene, PRO431  AG -5'-CACTAACTGGAGAGCGGTTTG-3', PRO408  SEP3 -5'- AATAGAGTTGGTGTCATAAGGTAACC-3', and PRO430  FUL -5'- CTCGTTCGTAGTGGTAGGAC-3', and recombined in pENTR/D-TOPO. After sequence control, all genomic fragments were recombined in the binary vector pMDC204 [ 52 ], resulting in translational GFP6 fusion constructs (pARC422, pARC423, and pARC424, respectively). Arabidopsis plants were transformed with  Agrobacterium tumefaciens  strain GV3101 using the floral dip method [ 53 ]. RNA gel blot analysis Total RNA was isolated from frozen plant tissue with
in the dark. Chlorophyll was removed by, first, 1 h incubation in 96% ethanol and then transference to 70% ethanol. Microscopy Plant tissue was observed for GFP expression with a Zeiss Axioskop UV-microscope, equipped with filter set 13 (excitation BP 470/20, beamsplitter FT 493, emission BP 505–530). Images were taken with a Leica DFC320 digital camera and an exposure time of 18 seconds was used. Confocal
procedure was performed as previously described [ 7 ] with some modifications. Fixed (15–30 min) inflorescence tissue (~ 0.8 g) was used of transgenic Arabidopsis plants containing construct pARC422 that carries a genomic  AG  fragment fused with GFP. Chromatin was solubilized on ice with a probe sonicator (MSE, Soniprep 150) by 3 cycles of 15 sec pulses of half maximal power with 30 sec cooling time between pulses. GFP antibody was used for the affinity purification (ab290; Abcam, Cambridge, UK) and for the negative control complete rabbit
determined using a real-time PCR detection system (MyiQ, Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA) by comparing the affinity purified sample (anti-GFP) with the negative control (rabbit serum). The results between the two samples were normalized using sequences of  Heat Shock Factor1  ( HSF1 ; At4g17750). The following primers were used, PRO469  AG -5'- TGGTCTGCCTTCTACGATCC-3' and PRO470 
120 ul 2× SDS sample buffer, incubated on ice and centrifuged at 20800 × g for 10 min at 4°C. The supernatant was boiled for 5 min. Western blotting was performed essentially as described previously [ 55 ]. The GFP antibody (ab290; Abcam)
