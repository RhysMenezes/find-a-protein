ABSTRACT:
RESULTS:
Fig. S2 ). The lipophilic dye FM4-64 is internalized in living cells through endocytosis and can be used to visualize the endocytic pathway from the plasma membrane to the tonoplast 20 21 . Two minutes after the transfer of GFP–PATROL1 transgenic plants into FM4-64 buffer, the fluorescent dye exhibited a punctate pattern typical of endosomes with little or no vacuolar staining in hypocotyl epidermal cells (
decreased after 30 min in the light ( Fig. 2c,d ; light for 30 min). The structures were rare in the guard cells of well-watered and irradiated plants, when most of the GFP–PATROL1 fluorescence was detected in close proximity to the plasma membrane ( Fig. 2e,f ; detached for 0 min). Within 30 min after detachment of the leaves, small fluorescent structures were observed inside the cell ( Fig. 2e,f ; detached for 30 min). These findings suggest that GFP–PATROL1 moved reversibly between the cytoplasm and the plasma membrane depending on environmental conditions. Mutation of  PATROL1  causes altered localization of AHA1 If PATROL1 has a role in intracellular membrane traffic, it might control the localization of ion
induces stomatal opening 7 23 . We generated transgenic plants containing a  GFP–AHA1  fusion gene in the WT (AHA1/WT) and  patrol1  (AHA1/ patrol1 ) background. In WT guard cells, GFP–AHA1 was localized mainly at the plasma membrane ( Fig. 3a ) as expected 24 . The internalization rate calculated from the number of guard cells that exhibited small fluorescent structures in their cytosol was 80% in AHA1/ patrol1  transgenic plants ( Fig. 3a,b ). This rate was significantly higher than that of AHA1/WT transgenic plants (8%;  Fig. 3a,b ), indicating that PATROL1 affects AHA1 localization to the plasma membrane. The slow anion channel SLAC1 contributes to anion efflux from guard cells and causes membrane depolarization, resulting in stomatal closure 25 26 . We compared the distribution of SLAC1–GFP fluorescence in transgenic WT and  patrol1  plants. Little internalization was observed in the guard cells of SLAC1–GFP transgenic plants even in the  patrol1  background (SLAC1/WT, 1%; SLAC1/ patrol1 , 3%;  Fig. 3a,b ). We examined another transporter, aquaporin PIP1a, which is localized in the plasma membrane of guard cells 27 . GFP–PIP2a has been used as a plasma membrane protein marker 28 , and we also detected GFP fluorescence in the plasma membrane (GFP–PIP2a/WT,  Fig. 3a,b ). In the  patrol1  background, the internalization rate of GFP–PIP2a was slightly increased but remained low (PIP2a/WT, 0%; PIP2a/ patrol1 , 8.6%;  Fig. 3a,b ). These results indicated that PATROL1 is target-selective, as it is required for the direction of AHA1 to the plasma membrane, but less so
activated by hyperpolarization, and mediates the influx of potassium into guard cells 29 . We could only slightly detect punctate structures of KAT1–GFP fluorescence in  patrol1  mutants, indicating that PATROL1 does not affect KAT1 localization to the plasma membrane (KAT1/WT, 0.6%; KAT1/ patrol1 , 1.1%;  Supplementary Fig. S5 ). To our knowledge, the KAT1–GFPfluorescence in WT chloroplast envelopes that we detected has never been discussed before, but some figures in a previous report 30  showed similar localization. Among the four GFP-tagged plasma membrane-localized proteins in our transgenic plants, the fluorescence intensity of GFP–AHA1 was the strongest. As overexpressed membrane-targeted GFP fusion proteins have a propensity to form organelle aggregates as a consequence of oligomerization 31 , we examined whether the increased internalization rate of the GFP–AHA1 in the  patrol1  mutant was caused by GFP. The monomeric red fluorescent protein (mRFP) contains 33 mutations compared to DsRed and was designed as a non-oligomerizing, true monomer 32 . The RFP-tagged AHA1 in the  patrol1  mutant appeared as numerous punctate structures in the cytosol ( Fig. 3c ), while it exhibited an extremely low fluorescence intensity in the plasma membrane ( Fig. 3d,e ), indicating apparent mislocalization of AHA1. We further attempted to identify plasma membrane H + -ATPases in the epidermis of rosette leaves using anti-H + -ATPase antibodies (anti-AHA) ( Supplementary Fig. S6 ). The mean value of the fluorescent intensity from immunohistochemical staining in  patrol1  was slightly but not statistically
H + -ATPases to the plasma membrane was disturbed by the mutation. Thus, PATROL1 may have a crucial role in the recruitments of not only AHA1 but also of the other H + -ATPases. 35S: PATROL1  and 35S: GFP–PATROL1  transgenic plants showed rather strong FC responses indicating increased AHA level in the plasma membrane ( Fig. 3f ). To obtain further insights into the relationship between PATROL1 and AHA1, we generated transgenic plants co-expressing GFP–PATROL1 and RFP–AHA1. In hypotonic conditions, which lead to stomatal opening, RFP–AHA1 was located in the plasma membrane, while GFP–PATROL1 seemed to line the membrane ( Fig. 4a ). In hypertonic conditions, which induce stomatal closure, RFP–AHA1 partially remained in the plasma membrane and GFP–PATROL1 seemed to support it. They resided on the plasma membrane–cell wall connection spots, that is, the tips of Hechtian strands in a plasmolyzed guard cells ( Fig. 4b , arrows). These relationships suggest that PATROL1 contributes to H +
