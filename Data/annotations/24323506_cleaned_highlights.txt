ABSTRACT:
  ANTHER INDEHISCENCE FACTOR  ( AIF ), a  NAC -like gene, was identified in  Arabidopsis.  In  AIF:GUS  flowers, β-glucuronidase (GUS) activity was detected in the anther, the upper parts of the filaments, and in the
RESULTS:
AIF+GFP (green fluorescent protein) fusion protein (uncleaved), were detected ( Fig. 3A ,  B ). The detection of the 40kDa AIF-C band demonstrates that the transgenic as well as endogenous AIF protein was processed and released from the ER in floral buds in the  35S:AIF+GFP  transgenic plants. The detection of the 87kDa AIF+GFP band indicates that some transgenic AIF proteins were most probably not processed and released from the ER in the mature flowers in the  35S:AIF+GFP  transgenic plants.

the fusion of the proteins AIF (60kDa) and GFP (27kDa). Two peptides, 40kDa (Fragment 2) and 47kDa, will be produced after the AIF+GFP protein is processed, and the 40kDa Fragment 2 (AIF - C) will be released from the ER. The anti-AIF antibody recognition site and the possible cleavage site for AIF are indicated by arrows. The transmembrane domain (TM) in the
MATERIALS AND METHODS:
 Supplementary Table S1  available at  JXB  online. An  Xba I fragment containing the cDNA truncated with the C-terminal region for the  AIF  gene was cloned into the linker region in binary vector pBImGFP3 (CHY Lab, Taichung, Taiwan) under the control of the  Cauliflower mosaic virus  (CaMV) 2×35S-Ω promoter ( 35S:AIF-C ) and used for further plant transformation.

Sequences for the primers are listed in  Supplementary Table S1  at  JXB  online. Construction of the  AIF-C+SRDX  construct To clone the DNA sequence encoding SRDX (LDLDLELRLGFA*), a PCR fragment was amplified, using the mGFP5 sequence as a template, with two rounds of PCR with the primers SRDX-for/mGFP-revII and SRDX-forII/mGFP-revII. The primers contained the  Kpn I and  Sac I recognition sites to facilitate the cloning of SRDX. The SRDX-for and SRDX-forII primers contained the overlapping sequence that encoded LDLDLELRLGFA and a stop codon (TGA) in the end of the SRDX sequence. The PCR fragment was inserted between the  Kpn I and  Sac I sites in the binary vector, pEpyon-32K (CHY Lab), from which the whole mGFP5 ( Kpn I– Sac I fragment) was removed to produce a SRDX fusion gene driven by the 2×35-Ω promoter, and was named pEpyon-3aK. For the  AIF-C+SRDX  construct, the cDNA for  AIF-C  was obtained by PCR
method described previously ( Yoo  et al. , 2007 ). For the  35S:YFP+AIF  and  35S:YFP+AIF-C  construct, cDNA containing an open reading frame of  AIF  was amplified by RT–PCR using the 5′ primer AtNACL3 5′X ma I and the 3′ primer AtNACL3 3′X ma I ( AIF ); and the 5′ primer
