to perceive red and far red light plants have evolved specific photoreceptors called phytochromes . even though the spectral properties of all phytochromes are very similar they show a distinct mode of action . here we describe _PROTEIN_ a negatively acting component of the signaling cascade that shifts the responsiveness of the phytochrome a _PROTEIN_ signaling system associated with hypocotyl elongation from red to far red wavelengths . _PROTEIN_ is a novel _LOCATION_ f box protein that contains a leucine zipper whose integrity is necessary for its biological function . _PROTEIN_ most probably acts by targeting activated components of the _PROTEIN_ signaling pathway to ubiquitin dependent proteolysis .
to clone the _PROTEIN_ gene we followed two different strategies screening for new _PROTEIN_ alleles in t dna lines and positional cloning . the increased light sensitivity observed has been used to screen for new alleles . under the applied low fluence rates of continuous red and far red light _PROTEIN_ mutants exhibited a strong photomorphogenic development with open cotyledons and a reduced hypocotyl growth whereas wild type seedlings remained nearly etiolated . this phenotype was strictly light dependent because all of the mutant lines exhibited an etiolated phenotype in darkness with elongated hypocotyls and closed cotyledons on an apical hook . one t dna tagged line _PROTEIN_ belonging to the _PROTEIN_ complementation group was used to clone flanking genomic sequences by inverse pcr . the genomic fragments belong to a gene located at about kbp from the luminidependensgene on chromosome . this close proximity to theluminidependens gene fits well with the data of the fine mapping because no recombinants with the respective marker were detectable after the analyses of chromatides . each of the alleles isolated so far showed a mutation in an intronless open reading frame having a length of bp . northern blots revealed one band of nucleotides corresponding to the size of the orf of the intronless _PROTEIN_ gene and the longest isolated _PROTEIN_ . for complementation analysis the strong _PROTEIN_ mutant was transformed with promotor _PROTEIN_ orf nos terminator construct and a genomic fragment that includes the putative promoter and the terminator of _PROTEIN_ . transgenic _PROTEIN_ lines exhibited a clearly reduced light sensitivity and they appear like wild type seedlings under selective light conditions . thus the _PROTEIN_ orf and the genomic fragment were sufficient to repress the hypersensitive phenotype in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . therefore we conclude that the respective dna sequence codes for gene product . the deduced _PROTEIN_ protein can be subdivided into at least five different domains . the most n terminal domain shows homology with f box proteins . scf _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ proteins are the major components of the so called scf complexes that function as ubiquitin ligases . scf complexes are involved in the proteasome dependent degradation of many regulatory proteins in yeast animals and plants . a leucine zipper pattern is adjacent to the f box motif . leucine zipper domains facilitate the homo or heterodimerization of polypeptides and they are present in different families of transcription _PROTEIN_ that also play an important role in the light signaling of plants . the functional significance of the respective domain in _PROTEIN_ is underlined by the mutation in the weak _PROTEIN_ allele which results in a glycine to cysteine transition immediately in front of the second leucine residue of the zipper pattern . to our knowledge _PROTEIN_ is the first f box protein reported to contain a leucine zipper that _METHOD_ to be necessary for its function . the c terminal part of _PROTEIN_ has no significant homology with known proteins . it contains a highly acidic domain followed by a basic domain . the functional importance of the c terminal part is emphasized by the phenotype of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ alleles that show structural alterations or deletions in this area . the f box protein function of _PROTEIN_ is further underlined by the results of a yeast two hybrid screening by using the full length polypeptide fused to the binding domain as bait . from positive clones were identical to _PROTEIN_ and one clone was identified as being _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are two arabidopsis homologs _PROTEIN_ of the yeast _PROTEIN_ protein . to demonstrate that the f box domain of _PROTEIN_ mediates interaction with _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ two different mutated constructs were tested . for the _PROTEIN_ construct the first amino acids containing the f box domain were deleted and for the _PROTEIN_ mutant the highly conserved proline amino acid at position was changed to an alanine residue . both mutations abolished the interaction of _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in a two hybrid assay . the results of the two hybrid assays could be verified by pull down experiments by using fusion proteins of _PROTEIN_ to wild type _PROTEIN_ or its mutated _METHOD_ . the _PROTEIN_ fusion proteins were _PROTEIN_ inescherichia coli and bound to glutathione s sepharose . methionine labeled _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ polypeptides were added and binding was analyzed by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and autoradiography . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ showed a strong interaction with the chimeric _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ polypeptide . the interaction was clearly reduced or abolished with the mutated _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ proteins . no interactions were detected with _PROTEIN_ the empty glutathion s sepharose and the labeled luciferase as negative controls . translational fusions to green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ were used to investigate the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ . in transiently transformed parsley protoplasts _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ appeared homogeneously distributed in the _LOCATION_ in dark and light treated protoplasts . in contrast cytoplasmic localization became detectable with the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein for which the first two basic amino acids in the basic domain were replaced by serine and glutamate residues . this result clearly demonstrates that the basic domain in _PROTEIN_ is a functional _LOCATION_ localization sequence . the _PROTEIN_ mutants exhibited an extremely enhanced sensitivity in a broad banded red light field as long as _PROTEIN_ was not completely degraded at higher fluence rates . analysis of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutants further confirmed that the observed hypersensitivity in red and far red light is strictly _PROTEIN_ dependent . to test for the spectral sensitivity in greater detail we determined action spectra for hypocotyl elongation in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutants under low light fluence rates . _PROTEIN_ mutants were used to exclude responses in the red light region of the electromagnetic spectrum that are predominantly regulated by _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis . a typical hir action spectrum with a maximum at nm was obtained for _PROTEIN_ . in contrast the action spectrum with the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutant was completely altered . even though the _PROTEIN_ mutant exhibited a fold increase in light sensitivity at nm the maximum light response was detectable around nm where it exhibited a fold higher value for relative photon effectiveness . the shape of thephyb _PROTEIN_ action spectrum is very similar to the absorption cross section of the inactive pr form of the photoreceptor and thus to the cross section expected for the formation of the physiologically active pfr form .
