the cytoskeletal _METHOD_ that underlie organelle transport in plants are intimately linked to acto myosin function . this function is mediated by the attachment of myosin heads to f actin and the binding of cargo to the tails . acto myosin also powers vigorous cytoplasmic streaming in plant cells . class xi myosins exhibit strikingly fast velocities and may have extraordinary roles in cellular motility . studies of the structural basis of organelle transport have focused on the cargo binding tails of myosin xi revealing a close relationship with the transport of _LOCATION_ mitochondria and _LOCATION_ vesicles . links between myosin heads and f actin based motility have been less investigated . to address this function we performed localization studies using the head neck domain of _PROTEIN_ a myosin xi from arabidopsis . we _PROTEIN_ the _METHOD_ fused head neck domain of _PROTEIN_ in epidermal cells of various plant species and found that it associated with f actin . by comparison to other markers such as fimbrin and talin we revealed that the myosin labeled f actin was of a lower quality and absent from the fine microfilament arrays at the cell cortex . however it colocalized with cytoplasmic f actin in areas coinciding with the tracks of fast organelles . this observation correlates well with the proposed function of myosin xi in organelle trafficking . the _PROTEIN_ that organelle streaming was reduced in cells _PROTEIN_ the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ indicated that the functionless motor protein inhibits endogenous myosins . furthermore co _PROTEIN_ of the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ with other f actin markers disrupted its attachment to f actin . in _LOCATION_ the _METHOD_ myosin associated with short bundles of f actin . the localization of the head of _PROTEIN_ in living plant cells as investigated here for the first time suggests a close linkage between this myosin xi and cytoplasmic microfilaments that support the rapid streaming of organelles such as _LOCATION_ . potential roles of _PROTEIN_ may also exist in the cell _LOCATION_ . whether the low quality of the f actin labeling by _PROTEIN_ compared to other f actin binding proteins _PROTEIN_ signifies a weak association of the myosin with actin filaments remains to be proven by other means than in vivo . clues for the mode of contact between the myosin molecules and f actin so far can not be drawn from sequence related data .

interval images of an epidermal cell of sinapis cotyledons co transformed with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and a peroxisomal marker . co transformation of a cell of a. cepa with _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and

all of the cells examined without differences in the density of the microfilament network it was independent of the _PROTEIN_ level . since the net produced by _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ applied to a typical f actin organization we tested for possible differences from other f actin binding proteins . we used _METHOD_ talin and _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ which contains the actin binding domain of arabidopsis fimbrin known to produce the best quality of f actin imaging in living plant cells . for comparison we introduced these _METHOD_ coupled _PROTEIN_ into the same plant tissues . because of the strong _PROTEIN_ due to the double promoter a _METHOD_ signal from the head neck fusion appeared very shortly after transformation and was clearly associated with f actin . however the imaging of f actin revealed that the _METHOD_ mtn and _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ labelled networks were much denser than the relatively loose mesh visualized by _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . cells _PROTEIN_ the myosin head fusion protein showed a filamentous pattern with fewer cross links and a slightly higher cytoplasmic background . after longer _PROTEIN_ times the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ signal became increasingly cytoplasmic and accumulated at diverse cellular sites . in addition the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ produced a less constricted signal than the _METHOD_ signal which sharply outlined the filaments . thus the myosin decorated microfilaments often appeared slightly wider compared to those of other _PROTEIN_ . at more than one day after transfection the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ molecules were localized almost entirely in the cytoplasm while the f actin labeled by _METHOD_ remained unchanged for at least h and only disappeared at d after transformation due to the normal decay in cellular viability . the f actin reporter _METHOD_ also produced different filamentous patterns near _LOCATION_ . the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ marked highly _METHOD_ short bundles in _LOCATION_ or occasionally _METHOD_ patches in or close to _LOCATION_ these were absent in cells _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . generally _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ labeled actin filaments appeared at various cellular sites as microfilaments extending from the cell cortex towards the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and as microfilaments running through cytoplasmic strands . microfilaments labeled by _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ were found only in the more internal regions of cells . this was noted when the plane of the f actin net was focused under the microscope starting from the uppermost surface of cells . while comparing cells _PROTEIN_ either _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ or _METHOD_ it became evident that the plane of focus of the labelled f actin net was nearly identical to that of the cell surface . in contrast the plane of the _PROTEIN_ focus of myosin labelled microfilaments never appeared in these cortical regions but localized in regions more than below the cell surface . to detect further differences in the labeling of f actin _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ were simultaneously introduced into cells . the actin filaments were exclusively decorated by the fimbrin protein while the myosin was localized entirely in the cytoplasm . to test whether other _PROTEIN_ respond in a similar manner due to possible competition for binding sites or limited space along f actin _METHOD_ was co _PROTEIN_ with _METHOD_ mtn . as result a similar actin network was visualized with fully overlapping signals . none of the _PROTEIN_ displayed enhanced cytoplasmic localization . when _METHOD_ mtn was co _PROTEIN_ with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ the myosin was again detached from filamentous actin . however if the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was co _PROTEIN_ with a peroxisomal marker under similar conditions its labelling ability was preserved . we then questioned whether the _PROTEIN_ decorated actin filaments reflect the _PROTEIN_ pathways of cytoplasmic movements . to address this we focused on the cytoplasmic strands with the most vigorous streaming of organelles and compared their distribution with the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ signal distribution . we also examined _LOCATION_ targeting in cells by co bombardment of a peroxisomal marker and the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ or _METHOD_ fusions . the most vigorous movement of organelles was observed in longitudinal and _LOCATION_ oriented strands that along with the actin cables occupied the more internal regions of the cell . thus _LOCATION_ highways appeared to coincide with the _PROTEIN_ more longitudinal filaments labeled by the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ or _METHOD_ . the apparent elongated shape of a _LOCATION_ that co distributes with the myosin labeled strand in the center of fig . indicates that the organelle was moving rapidly during imaging . because the transport of organelles is mediated by myosin overexpression of other f actin binding proteins is expected to interfere with cytoplasmic streaming by blocking the attachment of myosin to actin filaments . as shown previously such dominant negative effects on cytoplasmic streaming exist for _METHOD_ mtn and _METHOD_ overexpression _PROTEIN_ . in order to examine the possibility that excess _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ would interfere with the binding of endogenous myosin 's to f actin we transformed cells of a. cepa and measured the maximal streaming velocities with time lapse images . focusing only on rapidly moving particles to obtain `` mean maximal speeds '' has been proven to be a suitable approach for evaluating changes in cytoplasmic streaming _PROTEIN_ . in untransformed cells the mean maximal speed was the _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ reduced this by about without significant differences between the _PROTEIN_ . in control cells _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ alone the mean maximal speed was significantly _PROTEIN_ by about . thus it appears reasonable to assume that the net reduction of the maximal streaming velocity caused by myosin or fimbrin overexpression was about . comparison of streaming velocities in epidermal cells of a. cepa . maximal streaming velocity of particles in untransformed cells in cells _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ the vector containing the _METHOD_ fused head neck of _PROTEIN_ or the vector containing the _METHOD_ fused fimbrin actin binding domain . _LOCATION_ bars _PROTEIN_ . structural analysis of the motor domain of myosins has revealed that various regions and surface loops are involved in the contact between actin and myosin . to find possible clues to the interaction of _PROTEIN_ with f actin we aligned the amino acid sequences of several loops and the teds rule site from all class xi myosins in arabidopsis from dictyostelium myosin and from skeletal muscle myosin . the first actin binding site is partially conferred by loop . in all sequences it bears one or two negatively and positively charged amino acids . thus even though the loop sequences are quite divergent they have similar ionic strengths . comparison of several potential actin binding sites and the teds site on myosin heads

discoideum gg gallus gallus . conserved amino acids are red shaded . ddmyoj was excluded from the alignment in . surface loops according to et al . . in each sequence the position of the last amino acid residue is indicated . exceptionally atxi j has additional alterations in charge and _PROTEIN_ not present in the other sequences . a net positive charge also prevails in the secondary actin binding site . in all sequences a total of hydrophobic amino acid residues are in a conserved region which contributes to the primary actin binding . at the teds rule site which is named on the basis of these amino acids regulates motor activity by phosphorylation in some myosins all sequences have a unphosphorylatable and negatively charged glutamic acid . however a phosphorylatable threonine residue is proximal to the teds site in ddmyoj and all plant myosins .
the coding region of _PROTEIN_ was amplified from cdna obtained from arabidopsis leaves via rt pcr . using the _METHOD_ vector a derivative of pcat _METHOD_ we prepared an n terminal _METHOD_ fusion with the motor head of _PROTEIN_ including the neck domain _PROTEIN_ for transient _PROTEIN_ of proteins . the pcr primers used for the _PROTEIN_ construct were _PROTEIN_ as the forward primer and _PROTEIN_ as the reverse primer . the pcr products were cut with the respective enzymes bglii and spei and ligated into the pcat _METHOD_ vector via the bamhi and spei sites . the same vector

with hindiii and the fragment of kb was ligated with the binary _PROTEIN_ vector also cut with hindiii . the recombinant genes were verified by sequencing . in addition to a pcat construct containing _METHOD_ alone we used _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and a vector containing a _METHOD_ mtn _PROTEIN_ cassette for the visualization of f actin . for peroxisomal localization we used _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ fusions with the type _LOCATION_ targeting signal _PROTEIN_ . in case of transformation of allium cepa pieces were cut from onion bulb epidermis under sterile conditions and placed on cm petri dishes containing half strength murashige and skoog salts with vitamins mes sucrose and agar agar . in case of sinapis alba cotyledons of d old plants were transformed abaxially . epidermal cells were bombarded with gold particles that had been coated with dna as previously described _PROTEIN_ . after transformation petri dishes were placed for h at in the dark . visualization of _METHOD_ conjugated myosin heads was usually done after h _PROTEIN_ . longer _PROTEIN_ times were used for various purposes such as analysis of protein dissociation or competition assays . for infiltration of tobacco leaves with agrobacteria the abaxial surface of nicotiana benthamiana leaves was infiltrated by agrobacterium tumefaciens harboring the binary plasmid vector which contained the _PROTEIN_ cassette of pcat _METHOD_ or pcat _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . higher peaks of protein _PROTEIN_ were achieved by the simultaneous infiltration of in proven to reduce gene silencing after infection with agrobacteria . images from leaf epidermis were taken after d growth at at the peak of protein _PROTEIN_ with more than of epidermal cells showing _METHOD_ . leaves were ground in liquid nitrogen and protein extracts from about mg leaf powder were prepared by boiling for min at a ratio in the following _PROTEIN_ buffer mm tris/hcl ph m urea _PROTEIN_ beta mercaptoethanol glycerol and bromphenol blue . aliquots of protein extract for _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and for _METHOD_ alone were subjected to _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ followed by electroblotting onto nitrocellulose _LOCATION_ and immunoblot analysis . primary anti _METHOD_ antibody was used for detection of the _METHOD_ fusion and anti rabbit alkaline phosphatase conjugated antibody was used as secondary antibody . a broad range prestained protein marker was used for the estimation of molecular weights of proteins . development of the blots was carried out with a solution of nitroblue bromo chloro indolyl phosphate .

through the _METHOD_ filter set . in addition the limit for exposure to the _METHOD_ excitation was tested in a cell that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ mtn alone . during co _PROTEIN_ experiments _METHOD_ was excited for shorter times . due to the diffusive tendency of the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ exposure times between and _METHOD_ were used for widefield _METHOD_ microscopy proving to be a fast and appropriate method for studying its distribution . images were processed with adobe photoshop . images in fig . represent projections of images from optical sections taken with the objective at increments by the

different _PROTEIN_ the uppermost surface of cells for each construct was focussed upon with dic optics with the or the objective . then stepping slowly through the z axis under the respective excitation wavelength the display was observed until the f actin net became clearly visible . for the determination of maximal streaming velocities of organelles cells were observed with a plan apochromat oil immersion system n.a objective supplied with dic optics . we focused on all kinds of particles without specifying organelles . velocities of particles from cells for each construct were determined using time series images taken at sec intervals and analysed frame by frame with image j . as the velocity range of particles in a single cell is very broad the selection of three of the fastest particles per cell proved to be a fast and direct method which produced low standard deviations . monitored by the scroll function in image j these particles were followed for as long as fast translocation proceeded . the distance in covered by a particle between the first and the last image was determined by the `` analyze measure '' function of _PROTEIN_ j and divided by the respective
