genetic evidence links the arabidopsis monopteros _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ genes to the patterning of leaf veins . to elucidate their potential functions and interactions in this process we have assessed the dynamics of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ during vascular patterning in arabidopsis leaf primordia . both genes undergo a dynamic process of gradual refinement of _PROTEIN_ into files one to two cells wide before overt vascular differentiation . the subcellular distribution of _PROTEIN_ is also gradually refined from a non _PROTEIN_ distribution in isodiametric cells to strongly _PROTEIN_ in elongated procambial cells and provides an indication of overall directions of auxin flow . we found evidence that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ can be activated by auxin exposure and that _PROTEIN_ as well as gus _PROTEIN_ is defective in mp mutant leaves . taken together the results suggest a feedback regulatory loop that involves auxin _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and provide novel experimental support for the canalization of auxin flow hypothesis .
in this study we are assessing the spatio temporal _PROTEIN_ patterns of two components involved in leaf vascular development in a. thaliana _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and their potential interaction with auxin . hereafter we refer to _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ as the level of _PROTEIN_ mrna transcript indicated by in situ rna hybridization and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ or localization as indicated by the fusion protein _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transformed lines . vascular terminology is as described in citation and citation and as also shown in figure . terminology _PROTEIN_ positions within organs and individual cells is as defined in citation . first rosette leaf primordia stages are given in days after germination . in this study we show how _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is progressively restricted from broad regions to pre procambial cells . in dag leaf primordia _PROTEIN_ is initially _PROTEIN_ internally throughout the lamina excluding the margin in first leaf primordia or at elevated levels in the incipient primary vein . by dag _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ indicates the incipient secondary veins along the margin which eventually sharpen to form secondary veins that are one to two cells wide . for all subsequent basipetally formed secondary veins _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is first low in a large region between the margin and the existing secondary pre procambial strand before a distinct strand appears . the same process occurs in the proximity of a leaf serration . monopteros _PROTEIN_ is also gradually restricted during the formation of _PROTEIN_ veins . in the subsequent leaves the larger final size is accompanied by a more complex venation and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ pattern . monopteros is _PROTEIN_ at the site of incipient leaf primordia becoming confined to an internal domain of _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ is initially strong and widespread and can remain high and diffuse simultaneously in the first two secondary pre procambial veins . secondary veins in _PROTEIN_ leaves can appear in a two step process with strong and focused _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in pre procambial veins connecting the midvein with the margin prior to connecting with the more distal pre procambial veins . figure shows how the level of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is highest in pre procambial veins without overt cellular differentiation intermediate in procambial veins with elongated cells and low or absent in fully differentiated veins . in summary _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ appears to go through a process of gradual refinement from regions of low levels of _PROTEIN_ in many cells into single files of cells with strong _PROTEIN_ before procambial differentiation occurs . _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ overlaps considerably with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and also becomes restricted to pre procambial strands . in the first leaves by dag a two to three cell wide region of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ cells depicts the primary vein connecting to the hypocotyl vasculature with _PROTEIN_ narrowing to a one to three cell wide primary vein in older leaf primordia . a similar progressive delimitation of the primary vein strand is observed for _PROTEIN_ forming leaves . in all rosette leaves the first indication of secondary pre procambial veins based on _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ appears as a cluster of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ cells in the basal adaxial region . this region of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ cells is gradually restricted to form a continuous secondary strand that is one to two cells wide . secondary vein formation often occurs in two stages with the strand forming between the epidermis and midvein prior to connecting to a more distal region of the midvein or more distal secondary strand . this biphasic connection always occurs for the second to fourth secondary veins in _PROTEIN_ formed rosette leaves but is usually more simultaneous for the fourth and fifth pairs of secondary veins in the first leaves and the fifth and subsequently formed secondary veins in _PROTEIN_ rosette leaves . _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in developing higher order veins appears as either outgrowth from existing veins or connection of isolated or clustered _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ cells to a lower order vein . _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in all vein types is progressively lost in a basipetal direction as the more distal veins differentiate . _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ suggests a role for the epidermis in directing auxin into developing vascular regions . in slightly bulging primordia _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion proteins are localized to the apical end of all epidermal cells leading towards the primordia apex which overlies the developing primary vein . about the time of emergence of the first pair of secondary veins _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ is predominantly lost from the abaxial epidermis and becomes progressively more restricted to basal adaxial and marginal epidermal cells . thereafter _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ is always localized to the basal adaxial and marginal epidermal cells that are adjacent to the newly forming secondary veins connecting the epidermis and developing veins until the procambial strand is clearly delimited . in _PROTEIN_ formed rosette leaves this epidermal region includes areas just proximal and distal to a serration respectively involved in the formation of secondary and _PROTEIN_ marginal veins . some of the _PROTEIN_ formed rosette leaves also _PROTEIN_ abaxial _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ along much of the length of the primordia up until the formation of the fourth or fifth secondary veins . all vein classes show _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ localization once the narrow procambial strands are clearly formed . our results however indicate that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ proteins are initially diffusely distributed throughout the cytoplasm and/or on the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . in young primordia that show _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ on the apical ends of epidermal cells the procambial midvein cells often appear to have _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ throughout the cytoplasm which _PROTEIN_ localizes in the basal end of cells . developing secondary pre procambial cells often show diffuse _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ cytoplasmic _PROTEIN_ which _PROTEIN_ becomes _PROTEIN_ . the most obvious examples of early non _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ are observed in _PROTEIN_ forming rosette leaves that have broad regions of cells with diffuse _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . in these regions _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ gradually becomes more localized in fewer cells eventually forming a secondary procambial strand with highly _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ localization . epidermal cells adjacent to developing secondary pre procambial cells are often observed with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ throughout their cytoplasm which is eventually more localized to the _LOCATION_ as the secondary procambial strands develop or as a leaf serration expands . based on localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein we can predict the direction of auxin flow . auxin flow in the primary vein is predominantly in the basal direction . auxin flow is predominantly bidirectional along secondary strands with the distal cells having apical or basal _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ with the more basal cells always having basal _PROTEIN_ where they connect to the midvein with one or more cells within the strand having bidirectional _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ localization . less frequently _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ occurs only on the basal ends of procambial cells resulting in a basal direction of auxin flow along a given secondary strand . in young leaf primordia _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ becomes localized to the apical ends of epidermal cells presumably resulting in auxin flow to the apex before it is internalized through the primary procambial strand region . the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ can also become localized at the poles in epidermal cells adjacent to developing secondary strands indicating epidermal auxin flow towards a serration apex and then internally into the developing secondary strand . previous experiments to assess auxin induction of transcription of _PROTEIN_ and other auxin response _PROTEIN_ have been negative . instead the auxin response mediated by arfs is believed to come from auxin induced degradation of aux/iaa proteins that otherwise dimerize with and inhibit the dna binding of arfs . as shown in figure the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ is highly regulated . if it is not regulated at least in part by auxin one has to consider _METHOD_ other than canalization of auxin flow for the patterning of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . to assess whether _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ can be induced by auxin at a local level we exposed or day old seedlings grown in liquid medium to the synthetic auxin dichlorophenoxyacetic acid for h followed by whole mount in situ hybridization . we used the strong auxin response marker gus as a control to identify suitable conditions for auxin exposure . in day old seedlings exposure to d resulted in a patchy and weak activation of gus _PROTEIN_ whereas exposure to d resulted in a strong response throughout the lamina . exposure to d enhanced pre procambial _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and also resulted in ectopic _PROTEIN_ in ground cells between pre procambial veins predominantly in the basal part of leaf primordia regions where new secondary veins are forming . exposure to d resulted in strong _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ throughout the lamina except for a region two to three cells wide proximal to the margin . cells in this region appear to lack not only the competence to _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in response to auxin but also to respond to accumulation of endogenous auxin by vascular differentiation . that cellular competence may play a role in the response of _PROTEIN_ to auxin is further supported by exposure of day old leaf primordia to auxin where the response is limited almost entirely to the actively growing basal part of the primordia . the response of _PROTEIN_ in primordia of this age to exogenous auxin is similar to the auxin response reported for _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ to topical application of auxin . we can reproduce a similar induction of _PROTEIN_ mrna transcript by auxin exposure in liquid medium and detection by in situ hybridization providing further evidence of a similar response of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ to auxin . to assess whether _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ responds to changes in the distribution of endogenous auxin we exposed seedlings to auxin transport inhibitors rather than auxin . this kind of treatment is known to cause major alterations in auxin distribution and correlated changes in venation patterns . in young leaf primordia of seedlings germinated in the presence of phthalamic acid _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ primarily in a region two to three cells proximal and parallel to the leaf margin with low levels of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ throughout the central lamina . in more advanced primordia there can also be pre procambial strands of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ cells extending from the margin towards the petiole . this pattern of _PROTEIN_ in response to npa treatment is almost identical to that observed with the auxin sensitive gus reporter . since _PROTEIN_ encodes an auxin response _PROTEIN_ it is in theory possible that it regulates its own _PROTEIN_ . to assess this possibility we analyzed the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in primordia of mp mutants that produce a defective _PROTEIN_ transcript . we found _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in young primordia indicative of pre procambial primary veins and the first two pairs of secondary veins which is comparable to the _PROTEIN_ in wild type primordia of equal size . thus it appears that the _PROTEIN_ gene product does not feed back significantly on its own _PROTEIN_ during formation of pre procambial strands . the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in mp mutants is much reduced in _PROTEIN_ stages possibly due to the lack of pre procambial cells at this stage and a limited number of cells undergoing procambial differentiation . in summary we have found experimental support that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ can be altered by manipulation of auxin distribution and that early _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ does not depend on activity of the _PROTEIN_ protein . since the _PROTEIN_ gene encodes a transcriptional regulator it is possible that _PROTEIN_ depends on _PROTEIN_ for normal _PROTEIN_ . to assess this possibility we introduced the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ marker into the mp mutant background . in contrast to the initially normal _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in mp mutants _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in mp mutants is much reduced both quantitatively and qualitatively . the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in mp mutant primordia is evident in developing primary veins and incomplete secondary veins that terminate in a diffuse _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ region . in mp mutants _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ appears to be localized in the apical ends of epidermal cells in young emerging leaf primordia . in older mp primordia _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ becomes predominantly restricted to basal adaxial regions with little or no epidermal _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . similar to _PROTEIN_ in npa treated tissue _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ has diffuse lamina _PROTEIN_ two to three cells proximal to the margin in young primordia and marginal _PROTEIN_ with strands leading towards the petiole in older primordia although _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is higher near the margin of young primordia . treatment with npa predominantly inhibits the development of subcellular _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ localization in most internal cells and in the epidermis although _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ does become restricted to the basal adaxial and marginal epidermis in older primordia . the hypothesis of canalization of auxin flow predicts a feedback regulatory loop where auxin transport alters the pattern of auxin distribution . if _PROTEIN_ is part of such a regulatory loop one may expect alterations in the auxin response pattern in mp mutant leaves . the auxin response pattern of gus _PROTEIN_ in wild type primordia can be briefly summarized as having maxima at the apex and _PROTEIN_ serrations in addition to pre procambial and procambial _PROTEIN_ . most mp primordia have an abnormally large and diffuse apical maximum usually no _PROTEIN_ maxima diffuse pre procambial and rarely occurring procambial gus _PROTEIN_ . in wild type primordia npa treatment predominantly shifts gus _PROTEIN_ to the margin of the primordia . a similar distribution of gus _PROTEIN_ is seen in older primordia of mp and _PROTEIN_ mutants although the latter can often also form two or more apical maxima of gus activity . in summary mp mutants appear to fail to delimit and organize vascular and marginal auxin maxima while _PROTEIN_ mutants can organize extra auxin maxima .
