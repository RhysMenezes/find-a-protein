exocyst positive organelle is a double _LOCATION_ organelle mediating unconventional protein secretion in plants . the arabidopsis exocyst subunit _PROTEIN_ is essential for the recruitment of other exocyst subunits to expo and plays a key role in expo formation in both plant and animal cells .
when transiently _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis protoplasts both green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ and red _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ tagged versions of _PROTEIN_ localize as discrete punctae at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and in the cytoplasm . coexpression of both tagged versions produces completely overlapping signals for _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ . as previously described we interpret the _METHOD_ punctae as representing expo _PROTEIN_ . using the protoplast transient _PROTEIN_ system we therefore assayed for the ability of other arabidopsis exocyst subunits to be recruited to expo . we _PROTEIN_ these subunits either singly or together with _PROTEIN_ . in single _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ all gave rise to diffuse signals throughout the cytoplasm . however when coexpressed with _PROTEIN_ all were corecruited with _PROTEIN_ to the expo sites . the same result was obtained with _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . that the recruitment of _PROTEIN_ serves as a _LOCATION_ for the recruitment of other exocyst subunits was underlined by triple _PROTEIN_ experiments . these showed perfect colocalization of _METHOD_ punctae when _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ together with _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ or with _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . recruitment of sec exocyst subunit proteins to _PROTEIN_ positive organelles by _PROTEIN_ . when _PROTEIN_ individually in arabidopsis protoplasts _METHOD_ tagged sec exocyst proteins give rise to a _LOCATION_ pattern . however after coelectroporation as indicated the different sec exocyst proteins show in addition a punctate pattern and are colocalized with _METHOD_ protein tagged _PROTEIN_ . bar . multiple recruitment of sec exocyst proteins to the same expo by _PROTEIN_ . arabidopsis protoplasts were coelectroporated with _METHOD_ protein tagged _PROTEIN_ and different sec exocyst proteins as indicated . after h of _PROTEIN_ the protoplasts were observed in a _PROTEIN_ . bar . we performed single and coexpression experiments with _PROTEIN_ and a number of other subunits . of these _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ gave rise to punctate signals in addition to a diffuse _LOCATION_ background . nevertheless positive corecruitment with _PROTEIN_ was observed with these two paralogues . in contrast both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ produced only diffuse _LOCATION_ signals but did recruit to expo when _PROTEIN_ together with _PROTEIN_ . such corecruitment phenomena can also be seen with some other paralogues . paralogues that produced only diffuse _LOCATION_ signals and failed to be recruited to expo by coexpression with _PROTEIN_ were _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and . also did not corecruit with _PROTEIN_ but nevertheless did give rise to _METHOD_ punctae . some exocyst proteins can be recruited to expo by _PROTEIN_ . when _PROTEIN_ individually in arabidopsis protoplasts different proteins gave strong _LOCATION_ patterns . after coelectroporation with _METHOD_ protein tagged _PROTEIN_ as indicated these proteins show a punctate pattern and are colocalized with _PROTEIN_ . bar . other exocyst proteins do not show expo recruitment with _PROTEIN_ . whether singly _PROTEIN_ or coexpressed with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in arabidopsis protoplasts a number of other exocyst proteins give rise to only _LOCATION_ patterns . bar . to counteract the argument that the transient _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ is artifactual through the use of the promoter we generated an _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ construct under the control of the native _PROTEIN_ promoter . as seen in a similar density of overlapping _METHOD_ punctae for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ was obtained with the native promoter as previously seen with the promoter . _PROTEIN_ can also be recruited to expo by _PROTEIN_ driven by _PROTEIN_ native promoter . whether coexpressed with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ driven by _PROTEIN_ native promoter in arabidopsis protoplasts _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ shows a punctate pattern and is colocalized with _PROTEIN_ . bar . in addition to _PROTEIN_ we tested one of the other arabidopsis paralogues in _METHOD_ of its ability to corecruit other exocyst subunits . although as mentioned _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ gave rise to _METHOD_ punctae these did not lead to a corecruitment of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ when coexpressed . instead the signals for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ remained diffuse and _LOCATION_ . _PROTEIN_ can not recruit sec exocyst proteins to expo . various sec exocyst proteins remain _LOCATION_ even when coexpressed with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in arabidopsis protoplasts even though _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ itself produces _METHOD_ punctae . bar . because colocalization of _METHOD_ signals is an indicator but not proof of molecular interactions between two partners in a complex we performed both _METHOD_ resonance energy transfer assay and bimolecular _METHOD_ complementation on the putative interactions between _PROTEIN_ and other exocyst members . for the fret analysis protoplasts were observed in the confocal laser scanning microscope _PROTEIN_ after h of coexpression of the two _METHOD_ constructs and subjected to spectral fret analysis . as can be seen from we selected for this analysis two colocalizing _METHOD_ punctae . in each case there was a high degree shifting of _METHOD_ signal intensity from the emission peak of cyan _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ to the emission peak of yellow _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ which is a positive indicator of protein protein interaction . for the bifc analysis positive _METHOD_ signals were obtained after coexpression of the different exocyst partners when tagged with the split bifc constructs yc and yn . as controls we performed transient _PROTEIN_ with different combinations of the individual exocyst subunit with one or the other free bifc reagent . although different sec proteins can be positively recruited by _PROTEIN_ not all of them can directly interact with _PROTEIN_ . of interest some of them behaved as bridges between _PROTEIN_ and other exocyst members . visualization of protein protein interactions between different exocyst subunits and _PROTEIN_ by spectral fret and bifc . arabidopsis protoplasts were coelectroporated with different combinations of fusion protein constructs as indicated in a c and e g. after h of _PROTEIN_ the protoplasts were observed in a _PROTEIN_ and analyzed with spectral fret . _METHOD_ images and overlay images with bright field images from arabidopsis protoplasts coexpressing different combinations of bifc constructs as indicated . bar . interaction network of different exocyst subunits in plant cells . bold data from fret analysis not bold data from bifc assay . we introduced _PROTEIN_ into cultured human embryo kidney cells in an attempt to see whether an expo like structure could be induced by its overexpression . as detailed in supplemental figure full length _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ can be successfully _PROTEIN_ in cells its presence being detectable by both _METHOD_ and antibodies in western blots of total cell extracts . when transiently _PROTEIN_ in hek cells _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ showed a punctate distribution . of interest overexpression of human _METHOD_ in hek cells also gave rise to large _METHOD_ punctae although fewer in number . however when coexpressed with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ there was no overlap with the punctate human _METHOD_ signals . we also _PROTEIN_ yeast _METHOD_ in hek cells but only observed a diffuse _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ . overexpression of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ also leads to the formation of expo like structures in mammalian cells . when transiently _PROTEIN_ in cells _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ shows a punctate pattern . cells transfected with free _METHOD_ is included as control . merged differential interference contrast images . in contrast human labels the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ punctae and yeast shows only a _LOCATION_ pattern . whether singly _PROTEIN_ or coexpressed with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in arabidopsis protoplasts human or yeast produces only _LOCATION_ patterns . bar . to determine whether nonplant homologues could induce expo in arabidopsis protoplasts we performed the appropriate heterologous transient _PROTEIN_ experiments both in the presence and the absence of _PROTEIN_ . neither when _PROTEIN_ singly nor when coexpressed together with _PROTEIN_ was expo formed from the nonplant homologues although punctate _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ signals were still produced . we performed _METHOD_ with antibodies directed against a number of standard organelle markers on hek cells _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . the _METHOD_ punctae obtained did not overlap with any standard organelle markers for early endosomes the _LOCATION_ apparatus _PROTEIN_ endosomes or lysosomes or autophagosomes . expo like structures are distinct from conventional organelles in mammalian cells . _METHOD_ with standard organelle marker antibodies demonstrates that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ positive structures do not lie on the secretory or endocytic pathways . ee early endosome _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ endosome . bar . expo like structures are distinct from autophagosomes at different conditions in mammalian cells . _METHOD_ with autophagosome marker antibody anti _PROTEIN_ demonstrates that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ positive organelles are different from autophagosomes with or without starvation treatment . bar . expos present in wild type by cells and also in wild type arabidopsis root cells have two boundary _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ . when captured in the process of fusing with the pm they show continuity between the outer _LOCATION_ and the pm leaving a single _LOCATION_ bordered structure containing _LOCATION_ and ribosomes in the apoplast/cell wall . thin sections cut from cryofixed/freeze substituted hek cells _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ also reveal the presence of double _LOCATION_ expo like structures . expo like _LOCATION_ structures were not found in control nontransfected hek cells . ultrastructure of expo like structures in plant cells or cells stably _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . examples of expo like structures in transgenic tobacco by cell _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ arabidopsis wild type root cell and protein patch in transgenic arabidopsis cell _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . profiles of expo like structures in the cytoplasm from sections cut from high pressure frozen/freeze substituted samples of cells _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . immunogold labeling with _METHOD_ antibodies immunogold labeling with _PROTEIN_ antibodies . bars nm . to confirm the identity of these structures as expos we performed immunogold labeling on hek cells _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ with both _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ antibodies . with the _METHOD_ antibodies we obtained clusters of gold particles at the pm which resembled closely the images seen when immunogold electron microscopy was performed with _PROTEIN_ antibodies for expo fusion in plant cells . in addition _PROTEIN_ antibodies labeled the _LOCATION_ of the expo like structures .
