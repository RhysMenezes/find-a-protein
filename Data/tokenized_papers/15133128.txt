although early studies suggested that little compartmentalization exists within the _LOCATION_ more recent studies on metazoan _METHOD_ have identified a still increasing number of specific subnuclear compartments . some of these compartments are dynamic structures indeed protein and rna protein components can cycle between different domains . this is particularly evident for rna processing components . in plants lack of tools has hampered studies on _LOCATION_ compartmentalization and dynamics of rna processing components . here we show that transient _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ protein fusions of and small _LOCATION_ ribonucleoprotein particle specific proteins and nucleolar proteins _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and serine arginine rich proteins in plant protoplasts results in their correct localization . furthermore snrnp specific proteins also were correctly assembled into mature snrnps . this system allowed a systematic analysis of the cellular localization of arabidopsis serine arginine rich proteins which like their animal counterparts localize to speckles but not to nucleoli and cajal bodies . finally markers for three different _LOCATION_ compartments namely nucleoli cajal bodies and speckles have been established and were shown to be applicable for colocalization studies in living plant protoplasts . thus transient _PROTEIN_ of proteins tagged with four different _METHOD_ proteins is a suitable system for studying the _LOCATION_ organization of spliceosomal proteins in living plant cells and should therefore allow studies of their dynamics as well .
the lack of specific antibodies against plant spliceosomal proteins made it impossible to analyze the subnuclear organization of the splicing machinery in plant cells by indirect _METHOD_ . however correct localization of _METHOD_ tagged proteins in plant cells among them also some splicing _PROTEIN_ has been well documented . for example a _METHOD_ fusion of potato snrnp specific protein _PROTEIN_ in stably transformed tobacco by cells and in arabidopsis plants was shown to localize into a pattern that includes diffuse nucleoplasmic staining and strong accumulation in cajal bodies . in addition analyses of transgenic arabidopsis plants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ proteins _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ revealed speckled _LOCATION_ localization patterns . however generation of stable transgenic plants or cell suspension lines is time consuming and does not allow simultaneous analysis of many proteins . in particular colocalization studies that require at least two different _METHOD_ markers are very laborious when using transgenic plants . therefore we constructed plasmids for _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ proteins which together with the previously described pdedh _METHOD_ allow construction of c terminal _METHOD_ fusions of the protein of interest and analysis of fusion proteins in transient assays in plant protoplasts . all plasmids along with pdedh _METHOD_ were transformed into tobacco mesophyll and arabidopsis cell suspension protoplasts and h after transformation protoplasts were analyzed for the _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ proteins by confocal microscopy . all four _METHOD_ proteins are successfully _PROTEIN_ in both cell types showing localization in both cytoplasm and the _LOCATION_ as reported previously for _METHOD_ . in addition _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ proteins also was analyzed by western blotting which indicated similar _PROTEIN_ levels as expected from the _PROTEIN_ that all proteins are _PROTEIN_ from the same promoter with the same leader sequence and the same untranslated region . to find out whether transient _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ tagged spliceosomal proteins can be used for studying _LOCATION_ organization of the spliceosomal machinery in living plant protoplasts _METHOD_ fusions of arabidopsis snrnp specific proteins and were constructed . both _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ fusion proteins as well as _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ were found in the _LOCATION_ within a diffuse nucleoplasmic pool and in cajal bodies which in most cases localized next to the nucleoli . virtually all cells transformed showed the same localization pattern . in a small percentage of transformed cells irrespective of the _METHOD_ tag used both and also were found in the central nucleolar _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ . the same _LOCATION_ patterns were observed with _METHOD_ tagged smb protein a core component of and snrnps . the observed _LOCATION_ patterns of and resemble that described previously by means of indirect _METHOD_ with specific antibodies rna _METHOD_ in situ hybridization with snrna probe and _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ fusion protein in transgenic arabidopsis plants and tobacco by cells . however we have to mention here that the majority of transformed cells also showed localization of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ fusion proteins in the cytoplasm _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ even h after transformation . western analysis of cell lysates prepared from transformed cells showed that _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ fusion proteins are _PROTEIN_ at similar levels without detectable degradation products . to substantiate results obtained with snrnp specific proteins analysis of arabidopsis snrnp specific protein fused to _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ was performed . transient _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ tagged arabidopsis protein in tobacco or in arabidopsis protoplasts resulted in accumulation of fusion proteins in the _LOCATION_ in a characteristic network of speckles . only a small portion of both cell types used showed localization of in cajal bodies consistent with the _PROTEIN_ that snrnp does not accumulate in cajal bodies in plant cells . in contrast to _METHOD_ tagged and proteins _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ tagged was found exclusively in the _LOCATION_ already at the time point when _METHOD_ can be first detected . thus results obtained with transient _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ tagged and snrnp specific proteins in protoplasts provide strong evidence that this system can be used to study the _LOCATION_ organization of the spliceosomal machinery in living plant cells . to further substantiate confocal microscopy results obtained with and snrnp specific proteins immunoprecipitations with protein extracts prepared from protoplasts transformed with plasmids _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ fusion proteins were performed . all three proteins were efficiently precipitated with anti _METHOD_ antibody and more importantly with antibody against the cap at the end of u snrnas . none of the proteins was found in the pellet after incubation with protein a sepharose beads alone . in addition analysis of immunoprecipitates obtained with anti _METHOD_ antibody for the presence of snrnas revealed efficient coprecipitation of snrna with _METHOD_ and snrna with _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ fusion proteins but not of other spliceosomal snrnas . finally immunoprecipitations with protein extracts prepared from protoplasts coexpressing _METHOD_ and ha or _METHOD_ and ha fusion proteins resulted in efficient coprecipitation of the two proteins indicating correct assembly of transiently _PROTEIN_ proteins into mature snrnps . together immunoprecipitation data and localization studies by confocal microscopy clearly demonstrated that transient _PROTEIN_ of and snrnp specific proteins in protoplasts results not only in correct localization but also in efficient incorporation into mature snrnps . in addition snrnp specific proteins fused to _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ and fused to _METHOD_ proved to be good markers for cajal bodies in transiently transformed plant protoplasts . having established a transient _PROTEIN_ system in which _METHOD_ tagged proteins localize and assemble correctly we asked next whether this system can be used for colocalization studies of two different proteins . arabidopsis protoplasts were cotransformed with plasmid combinations indicated in figure and h _PROTEIN_ analyzed by confocal laser scanning microscopy . in general > of transformed cells showed _PROTEIN_ of both _METHOD_ tagged proteins . because and are components of the same snrnp we asked whether they colocalize in cotransformed cells . arabidopsis protoplasts coexpressing _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ showed perfect colocalization of proteins in cajal bodies and nucleoplasm . this is consistent with the coprecipitation of these two proteins . in addition coexpression of smb _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ resulted in colocalization of the two proteins in cajal bodies and nucleoplasm consistent with the _PROTEIN_ that smb is component of the snrnp as well . was shown to localize in a speckled pattern in the nucleoplasm . in addition in a small percentage of cells localization in cajal bodies also was observed . this localization pattern is different from those obtained with and proteins . coexpression of _METHOD_ tagged with _METHOD_ resulted in partial colocalization in the nucleoplasm but not in cajal bodies . in cells where localized to cajal bodies colocalization with also was observed although not to the extent observed in cells coexpressing and . in contrast coexpression of with _PROTEIN_ an arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ protein that localizes to speckles resulted in perfect colocalization of the two proteins in speckles but not in cajal bodies consistent with the _PROTEIN_ that _PROTEIN_ proteins do not localize to cajal bodies . analysis of arabidopsis protoplasts coexpressing _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ an established marker for nucleoli and cajal bodies showed that _PROTEIN_ colocalizes with both proteins in cajal bodies but not in the nucleoli . colocalization was not observed in nucleoplasm . these results are consistent with _LOCATION_ patterns obtained for each protein separately in which and localized to cajal bodies and nucleoplasm whereas _PROTEIN_ localized to nucleoli and cajal bodies . like with and coexpression of smb _METHOD_ with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ resulted in colocalization of the two proteins in cajal bodies but not in nucleolus . in addition portion of smb present in the central nucleolar _LOCATION_ did not colocalize with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . _PROTEIN_ is another established marker for nucleoli . however _PROTEIN_ also localized to cajal bodies whereas no evidence for localization of _PROTEIN_ in cajal bodies was provided . in arabidopsis cells coexpressing _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ the two proteins colocalized in nucleoli but not in cajal bodies . this indicated that _PROTEIN_ is not associated with cajal bodies . consistent with this in cells coexpressing either _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ no colocalization was observed confirming that _PROTEIN_ indeed does not localize in cajal bodies . together colocalization studies presented in figure clearly demonstrate that coexpression of two proteins with different subnuclear localizations does not influence each others localization . moreover colocalization was observed only with protein combinations where this was expected indicating that transient _PROTEIN_ of two different _METHOD_ tagged proteins is suitable for colocalization studies in living plant cells . in mammalian cells the majority of pre mrna splicing _PROTEIN_ show speckled _LOCATION_ localization pattern . _PROTEIN_ proteins have often been used as markers for _LOCATION_ speckles also called _PROTEIN_ domain because of localization of _PROTEIN_ protein _PROTEIN_ in them . the arabidopsis genome encodes for _PROTEIN_ proteins that can be grouped into subfamilies according to their domain organization . the established transient _PROTEIN_ system allowed us to extend the localization studies to plant _PROTEIN_ proteins . plasmids _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ fusions of of arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ proteins were constructed and localization of fusion proteins was analyzed in tobacco and arabidopsis protoplasts . in both cell types _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ fusions of all _PROTEIN_ proteins analyzed were found in the _LOCATION_ in a pattern resembling speckles in mammalian cells . the appearance of speckles in tobacco cells varied from irregularly shaped to more regularly shaped dot like structures _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . in addition a diffuse nucleoplasmic staining also was observed . in contrast speckles in arabidopsis cells were less prominent and smaller and more protein was found in a diffuse nucleoplasmic pool irrespective of the _METHOD_ tag used . analysis of protein _PROTEIN_ by western blotting with anti _METHOD_ and anti _METHOD_ antibodies revealed that the stronger speckled appearance in tobacco cells can not be accounted to aggregation of degraded proteins because no major degradation products were detected . all images shown in figure were taken with living cells h after transformation however analysis of transformed cells as early as h after transformation also revealed _LOCATION_ localization of all proteins analyzed indicating that the import of _PROTEIN_ proteins into _LOCATION_ is very rapid . in addition it became clear that none of the analyzed _PROTEIN_ proteins associates with nucleoli seen as black areas inside the _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ . because all images in figure are single confocal sections nucleoli are not visible in all _LOCATION_ shown . however cotransformation of representatives of each subgroup of arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ proteins fused to _METHOD_ with the established nucleolar marker _PROTEIN_ fused to _METHOD_ clearly demonstrated that none of the _PROTEIN_ proteins associates with nucleoli . because some splicing _PROTEIN_ particularly snrnps have been found in cajal bodies we asked next whether _PROTEIN_ proteins localize into this _LOCATION_ compartment . arabidopsis cell suspension protoplasts were cotransformed with plasmids _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ proteins fused to _METHOD_ and or proteins fused to _METHOD_ . both and proteins localized into cajal bodies and in a diffuse/speckled pattern in which partial colocalization with _PROTEIN_ proteins was detected . none of the _PROTEIN_ proteins localized to cajal bodies as evident from the lack of colocalization with or at these sites . thus we conclude that in arabidopsis like in mammalian cells _PROTEIN_ proteins do not localize in cajal bodies .
