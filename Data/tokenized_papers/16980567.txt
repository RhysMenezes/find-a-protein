we have previously demonstrated that _LOCATION_ sorting receptor proteins are concentrated on prevacuolar compartments in plant cells . pvcs in tobacco by cells are multivesicular bodies as defined by vsr proteins and the _PROTEIN_ reporter where the transmembrane domain and cytoplasmic tail sequences of _PROTEIN_ are sufficient and specific for correct targeting of the reporter to pvcs . the genome of arabidopsis contains seven vsr proteins but little is known about their individual subcellular localization and function . here we study the subcellular localization of the seven arabidopsis vsr proteins _PROTEIN_ based on the previously proven hypothesis that the tmd and ct sequences correctly target individual vsr to its final destination in transgenic tobacco by cells . toward this goal we have generated seven chimeric constructs containing signal peptide linked to green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ and tmd/ct sequences _METHOD_ of the seven individual atvsr . transgenic tobacco by cell lines _PROTEIN_ these seven sp _METHOD_ tmd ct fusions all exhibited typical punctate signals colocalizing with vsr proteins by confocal _METHOD_ . in addition wortmannin caused the _METHOD_ marked prevacuolar organelles to form small _LOCATION_ and vsr antibodies labeled these enlarged mvbs in transgenic by cells . wortmannin also caused vsr marked pvcs to vacuolate in other cell types including arabidopsis rice pea and mung bean . therefore the seven atvsrs are localized to mvbs in tobacco by cells and wortmannin induced vacuolation of pvcs is a general response in plants .
phylogenetic analysis based on full length vsr protein sequences indicated that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are closely related to the pumpkin and black gram vmvsr while _PROTEIN_ and are more closely related to the pea _PROTEIN_ and the other three atvsr members are grouped into another cluster depending on their evolutional relationship . alignment analysis also indicated that these vsrs are highly conserved within their tmd and ct regions . in addition all vsrs contain a tyr motif _PROTEIN_ in their ct regions that might interact with ap clathrin _PROTEIN_ protein complex of the clathrin coated vesicles in the plant secretory pathway . to study the subcellular localization of the seven atvsr proteins we generated various chimeric constructs that contain sp sequences from the barley proaleurain linked to _METHOD_ and tmd/ct sequences of individual atvsr _METHOD_ . because the sequences of atvsrs are known we thus designed overlapping primer pairs that cover the full length of individual vsr tmd/ct sequences for self priming pcr . the amplified double strand dna of tmd/ct then served as template in further pcr using primers . such cloning strategy does not need to use vsr dna as template in pcr . using this approach we generated the seven _METHOD_ atvsr chimeric constructs for subsequent transformation into tobacco by cells . the seven _METHOD_ atvsr _METHOD_ chimeric constructs were transferred into tobacco by cells via standard agrobacterium tumefaciens mediated transformation . as controls we used transgenic by cell lines _PROTEIN_ the _LOCATION_ marker _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and the pvc marker _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ reporter . more than individual transgenic by cell lines _PROTEIN_ each of the seven _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ to fusions and the _METHOD_ fusion were generated where was likely a vsr for sorting storage proteins to psvs in pumpkin seeds . cells from all these transgenic by cell lines _PROTEIN_ various _METHOD_ vsr fusions gave typical punctate _METHOD_ signals an indication of either _LOCATION_ or pvc localization . most of these _METHOD_ signals colocalized with _METHOD_ antibody staining in confocal _METHOD_ of fixed cells indicating that the punctate _METHOD_ signals were derived from the _METHOD_ vsr fusion proteins . the correct _PROTEIN_ of the full length _METHOD_ vsr fusion proteins was further confirmed by western blot analysis with _METHOD_ antibodies in these transgenic by cells . as shown in figure a protein band of kd corresponding to the full length fusion protein was detected predominantly in the cell _LOCATION_ fraction of all tested transgenic tobacco by cell lines _PROTEIN_ various _METHOD_ vsr fusions including the positive control _PROTEIN_ reporter . however no such band was detected in wild type by cells . these results demonstrated that all the _METHOD_ atvsr and _METHOD_ fusions were _PROTEIN_ correctly in transgenic by cells . the difference in signal intensity of various _METHOD_ vsr fusions detected by _METHOD_ antibodies in western blot analysis is presumably due to the different _PROTEIN_ levels of these fusions in transgenic by cells . we previously demonstrated that vsr proteins are concentrated on pvcs . using vsr antibodies as markers in immunoem the lytic pvcs were identified as mvbs in tobacco by cells . in addition the _PROTEIN_ reporter containing the _PROTEIN_ tmd/ct colocalized with endogenous tobacco vsr proteins . therefore both vsrs and the _PROTEIN_ reporter are pvc markers . the properties of pvcs were also studied using transgenic by cells _PROTEIN_ the pvc marker _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ reporter versus the _LOCATION_ marker _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . bfa at low concentrations caused the _METHOD_ marked _LOCATION_ but not the _METHOD_ marked pvc to form bfa induced aggregates . in contrast wortmannin caused _METHOD_ marked pvcs to form small _LOCATION_ while _METHOD_ marked _LOCATION_ remained unchanged . therefore pvc localization of the _PROTEIN_ reporter can be confirmed by the following three criteria colocalization with vsr antibodies formation of small _LOCATION_ in response to wortmannin treatment and no change in bfa treated cells . we therefore used these three criteria to identify the organelles marked by various _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ to fusions in transgenic tobacco by cells . consistent with previous results in transgenic by cells _PROTEIN_ the pvc marker _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ typical punctate _METHOD_ patterns were observed in living cells and these punctate _METHOD_ signals mostly colocalized with vsr antibodies in confocal _METHOD_ . in addition wortmannin treatment caused the _METHOD_ marked pvcs to vacuolate while bfa treatment did not cause any changes in _METHOD_ marked pvcs . in contrast in transgenic by cells _PROTEIN_ the _LOCATION_ marker _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ the punctate _METHOD_ signals were largely separated from vsr labeled pvcs where bfa caused them to form aggregates but the punctate _METHOD_ signals remained unchanged in the presence of wortmannin . similarly in transgenic cells _PROTEIN_ the _METHOD_ most of the punctate _METHOD_ signals colocalized with vsr . while wortmannin induced the _METHOD_ marked organelles to form small _LOCATION_ bfa did not cause any visible changes to these _METHOD_ marked organelles . therefore _METHOD_ localized to pvc in transgenic by cells . summary of various _METHOD_ fusions in transgenic by cells similar results were obtained from the transgenic by cells _PROTEIN_ seven individual atvsr fusions from _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ to _METHOD_ . most of the punctate _METHOD_ signals in these transgenic cell lines colocalized with vsr and these _METHOD_ marked organelles were also induced to form small _LOCATION_ in the presence of wortmannin but did not respond to bfa treatment . therefore all _METHOD_ atvsr fusions are most likely localized to pvcs in transgenic by cells . however because the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ to fusions do not fully colocalize with vsr antibodies we thus can not exclude the possibility that different pvc types may exist in tobacco by cells . the spacer region in front of the tmd of vsr is thought to be important for proper protein folding that would allow flexibility of the reporter linking to tmd . we previously used the _PROTEIN_ spacer in the chimeric reporter system to study trafficking of integral _LOCATION_ proteins in tobacco cells . when _PROTEIN_ in tobacco cells the _PROTEIN_ reporter colocalized with endogenous vsr proteins . therefore the tmd/ct sequences are sufficient and specific to target the reporter to pvcs . however in this study we used the original spacer from individual atvsrs to make the seven _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ to fusions . to test the possible effect of spacer sequence on the pvc localization of _METHOD_ atvsr fusions and thus subcellular localization of atvsrs we generated two reporter fusions with the same tmd/ct sequences as but their spacer sequences were derived from and _PROTEIN_ respectively . was chosen because it was relatively far away from _PROTEIN_ in _METHOD_ of evolutionary distance and because _PROTEIN_ and had less amino acid similarity especially on the spacer region . thus we replaced the spacer sequences in _METHOD_ with that from _PROTEIN_ and compared their subcellular localization in transgenic by cells . as shown in figure transgenic by cells _PROTEIN_ either the _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ showed typical punctate _METHOD_ signals that mostly colocalized with vsr thus representing pvcs . in addition wortmannin treatment induced the _METHOD_ marked pvcs to form small _LOCATION_ but bfa did not cause any visible changes to punctate _METHOD_ signals in both transgenic cell lines . therefore it is likely that the spacer sequences from _PROTEIN_ do not affect pvc localization of _METHOD_ atvsr in transgenic by cells and targeting of vsr proteins to pvcs depends solely on their tmd and ct sequences . when _PROTEIN_ in transgenic tobacco by cells the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ reporter colocalized with endogenous vsrs . in addition wortmannin induced the _METHOD_ marked pvcs to form small _LOCATION_ in transgenic by cells where the enlarged pvcs were still labeled by anti vsrs . similarly in this study all organelles marked by _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ to formed small _LOCATION_ in response to wortmannin treatment . to further test if vsr proteins are still present in these wortmannin induced enlarged pvcs confocal _METHOD_ with vsr antibodies was carried out in wortmannin treated transgenic cells where their corresponding untreated cells were used as controls . as shown in figure in transgenic cells _PROTEIN_ the positive control _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ reporter most of the punctate _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ signals colocalized with vsrs in the absence of wortmannin . when the cells were treated with wortmannin the _METHOD_ marked pvcs became vacuolated and these enlarged _LOCATION_ colocalized with vsrs . similarly in transgenic by cells _PROTEIN_ either _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ most of the punctate _METHOD_ signals in untreated cells and the vacuolated _METHOD_ signals in wortmannin treated cells colocalized with vsrs . furthermore in untransformed wild type by cells vsr antibodies detected typical punctate organelles and small _LOCATION_ in untreated and wortmannin treated cells respectively . these results demonstrated that all _METHOD_ vsr fusions were targeted to pvcs and wortmannin specifically induced the vacuolation of pvcs in both wild type and transgenic by cells . to further study the vsr labeled structures in untreated and wortmannin treated by cells structural em with conventional chemical fixed samples and immunoem using vsr antibodies on high pressure frozen/freeze substituted samples were also carried out . as shown in figure in cells without wortmannin treatment typical mvbs with sizes of about to nm in diameter that contain small but uniform internal vesicles were observed and these mvbs were specifically labeled by vsr antibodies _PROTEIN_ on the _LOCATION_ . however in wortmannin treated cells many enlarged mvbs with sizes of over nm in diameter were observed and these enlarged mvbs were specifically labeled by vsr antibodies on their limiting _LOCATION_ . these em studies further confirmed the results of confocal microscopic observations and demonstrated that the _METHOD_ marked pvcs were vacuolated in response to wortmannin treatment these small _LOCATION_ were labeled by vsr antibodies on their outer _LOCATION_ . many plants contain vsrs . our results indicated that all tested _METHOD_ vsr fusions containing tmd/ct sequences from different plant species _PROTEIN_ in transgenic by cells formed small _LOCATION_ in response to wortmannin treatment this was further confirmed by immunoem studies using vsr antibodies . therefore we carried out experiments to find out if such wortmannin induced vacuolation of pvcs is a general response in plant cells . western blot analysis with vsr antibodies was first carried out with protein samples extracted from various plants including arabidopsis rice tobacco pea and mung bean . as shown in figure vsr antibodies detected a single band at kd in all these tested protein samples indicating that vsr proteins are universally present in these plant cells . to further study the vsr marked organelles in these cell types confocal _METHOD_ with vsr antibodies was then carried out in both cultured cells and root tip cells . as shown in figure typical punctate signals were detected with vsr antibodies in all these cells a result consistent with the detection of pvcs by vsr antibodies in these cell types . in addition when these cells were treated with wortmannin prior to fixation and subsequent immunostaining with vsr antibodies enlarged and small _LOCATION_ were detected in all these wortmannin treated cell types a result further demonstrating that these vsr labeled organelles were pvcs in these cell types and that wortmannin induced vacuolation of pvcs is a general response in plant cells .

chimeric constructs that contain sp sequence from the barley proaleurain linked to _METHOD_ and the tmd/ct sequences of individual atvsr _METHOD_ two pairs of primers were designed and used to generate dsdna containing the spacer tmd/ct sequences of individual vsr . are overlapped primer pairs that cover the full length spacer tmd/ct sequences of individual vsr to be used for self priming pcr to generate the dsdna fragment of spacer tmd/ct sequences which in turn will serve as templates for further pcr using primer pairs to generate full length spacer tmd/ct sequences of individual vsr . and contain an ecori site while and contain a stop codon and saci site . individual spacer tmd ct dna fragments from the above pcr were gel purified and digested with ecori/saci before being cloned into _METHOD_ via the same restriction sites to replace the spacer _PROTEIN_ tmd/ct sequences . the resulting constructs were then cloned into the binary vector _METHOD_ via hindiii/saci sites before
