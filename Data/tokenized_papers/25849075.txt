protein palmitoylation which is critical for _LOCATION_ association and subcellular targeting of many signaling proteins is catalyzed _PROTEIN_ by protein s acyl transferases _PROTEIN_ . only a few plant proteins have been experimentally verified to be subject to palmitoylation such as rop _PROTEIN_ calcineurin b like proteins _PROTEIN_ and subunits of heterotrimeric g proteins . however emerging evidence from palmitoyl proteomics hinted that protein palmitoylation as a post translational modification might be widespread . nonetheless due to the large number of genes encoding _PROTEIN_ and the lack of consensus motifs for palmitoylation progress on the roles of protein palmitoylation in plants has been slow . we combined pharmacological and genetic approaches to examine the role of protein palmitoylation in root hair growth . multiple _PROTEIN_ from different endomembrane compartments may participate in root hair growth among which the _LOCATION_ localized _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plays a major role while the tonoplast localized _PROTEIN_ plays a secondary role in root hair growth . a specific inhibitor for protein palmitoylation bromopalmitate _PROTEIN_ compromised root hair elongation and _PROTEIN_ . using various probes specific for cellular processes we demonstrated that _PROTEIN_ impaired the dynamic polymerization of actin microfilaments the asymmetric _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ localization of phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate _PROTEIN_ the dynamic distribution of _PROTEIN_ positive post _LOCATION_ secretion and endocytic trafficking in root hairs . by combining pharmacological and genetic approaches and using root hairs as a model we show that protein palmitoylation regulated by protein s acyl transferases at different endomembrane compartments such as the _LOCATION_ and the _LOCATION_ is critical for the _PROTEIN_ growth of root hairs in arabidopsis . inhibition of protein palmitoylation by _PROTEIN_ disturbed key intracellular activities in root hairs . although some of these effects are likely indirect the cytological data reported here will contribute to a deep understanding of protein palmitoylation during tip growth in plants . the online version of this article contains supplementary material which is available to authorized users .
to examine cellular processes affected by _PROTEIN_ in root hairs it was necessary to develop a suitable treatment regime that would reveal the effects of inhibiting protein palmitoylation on cellular processes without causing severe cellular damages . to do so we utilized the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ as an indicator for the effective inhibition of palmitoylation . _PROTEIN_ dissociated from the tonoplast and moved to the cytoplasm when its key palmitoylation site was mutated or in the _PROTEIN_ mutants . based on previous studies we added _PROTEIN_ at a final concentration of to to _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgenic seedlings days after germination in a hypotonic _METHOD_ solution to determine the effects on the tonoplast association of _PROTEIN_ . because _PROTEIN_ was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide _METHOD_ equivalent volumes of _METHOD_ were applied as controls in which no phenotypic consequences were detected over the time course of the experiments . as an additional control we also introduced the same _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgene into _PROTEIN_ by crosses in which _PROTEIN_ was rendered _LOCATION_ . as expected _PROTEIN_ treatment resulted in gradual relocalization of _PROTEIN_ from the tonoplast to the cytoplasm of root hairs . root hairs incubated with _PROTEIN_ for hrs showed the most substantial reduction of _PROTEIN_ at the tonoplast and at hrs showed complete absence of tonoplast _PROTEIN_ . increasing _PROTEIN_ concentration from to did not substantially accelerate the tonoplast dissociation of _PROTEIN_ but induced extensive vacuolation . based on these results we used _PROTEIN_ on root hairs and examined cellular processes from to hrs after _PROTEIN_ application for further experiments.figure _PROTEIN_ abolished the

of _PROTEIN_ for hrs did not cause a substantial change in primary root length . however compared to roots treated with _METHOD_ those treated with _PROTEIN_ showed a much expanded region of root hair initiation suggesting inhibited root hair elongation . indeed the _PROTEIN_ growth of root hairs was significantly affected by _PROTEIN_ treatment such that root hairs were shorter and wider than those treated with _METHOD_ at the maturation zone . in addition _PROTEIN_ caused extensive vacuolation in growing root hairs compared to root hairs treated only with _METHOD_ .figure _PROTEIN_

in root hairs or pollen tubes . indeed _PROTEIN_ mutants exhibited defective growth in both root hairs and pollen tubes . _PROTEIN_ was shown to be _LOCATION_ localized by using transient _PROTEIN_ in tobacco epidermal cells . however transient heterogeneous _PROTEIN_ with strong constitutive promoters does not always reflect the native localization of proteins as is the case for _PROTEIN_ . to determine its native localization we introduced a _PROTEIN_ genomic fragment _METHOD_ translational fusion driven by its native promoter _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ into _PROTEIN_ a novel null mutant . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fully restored the root hair defects of _PROTEIN_ indicating that the _METHOD_ fusion did not interfere with its functionality . to verify that the punctate vesicles labeled by _PROTEIN_ were of _LOCATION_ identity we applied the lipophilic dye and the fungal toxin brefeldin a to _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ roots . enters cells via endocytic trafficking and sequentially labels trans _LOCATION_ network/early endosomes prevacuolar compartment/multivesicular bodies then finally reaches the tonoplast . bfa interferes with the activity of arf _PROTEIN_ and its application resulted in the formation of so called bfa compartments with a tgn/ee core surrounded by aggregates of _LOCATION_ . uptake together with bfa treatment confirmed the localization of _PROTEIN_ at the _LOCATION_ . to find out whether _PROTEIN_ played a dominant role in root hair growth we applied _PROTEIN_ to _PROTEIN_ roots and analyzed root hair morphology . there were slight but not significant morphological changes to root hair length and width in _PROTEIN_ treated _PROTEIN_ suggesting that _PROTEIN_ is a major _PROTEIN_ functioning in root hairs.figure _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ localize at different endomembrane compartments in root hairs . a c. representative initiating root hair elongating root hair or mature root hair of dag _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ transgenic seedlings . d f.

was unclear whether _PROTEIN_ played a role in root hair growth . in _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was localized at the tonoplast of root hairs at all stages . we therefore analyzed the root hair morphology of _PROTEIN_ in the absence or presence of _PROTEIN_ . root hair initiation and _PROTEIN_ was not affected as hair width was comparable between wt and _PROTEIN_ . however root hair length was significantly reduced by _PROTEIN_ loss of function . treatment of _PROTEIN_ resulted in similar defects in _PROTEIN_ as in wild type i.e . root hair initiation was substantially inhibited . these results suggest that protein palmitoylation is important for root hair growth with _PROTEIN_ plays a major role and other _PROTEIN_ such as _PROTEIN_ also participating . because _PROTEIN_ treatment significantly affected the _PROTEIN_ growth of root hairs we explored the underlying _METHOD_ by examining the effects of _PROTEIN_ on critical intracellular activities during root hair growth such as the dynamic polymerization of actin mf and the asymmetric pm distribution of _PROTEIN_ . to analyze actin mf dynamics we treated arabidopsis transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ which specifically labels actin mf _PROTEIN_ with either _PROTEIN_ or _METHOD_ and examined the pattern of actin mf in root hairs . in root hairs treated with _METHOD_ longitudinal or slightly helical actin cables extended to the subapical region from the base while short actin bundles as indicated by punctate filamentous signals were present in the apical region where active growth occurred . by contrast treatment with _PROTEIN_ caused fragmentation as well as extensive cross linking of actin mf . as a result few longitudinal actin cables were observed in _PROTEIN_ treated bulging root hairs . instead numerous short actin filaments formed a mesh like network extending to the apical region . in elongating root hairs under _PROTEIN_ treatment actin cables along the root hair shank were dotted with punctate actin aggregates . these effects occurred as quickly as hrs after _PROTEIN_ treatment indicating the sensitivity of the dynamic polymerization of actin mf . treatment of root hairs with the actin mf depolymerization drug latrunculin b indicated that depolymerization of actin mf did result in punctate aggregates . however latb treatment did not cause extensive cross linking of actin mf in root hairs in contrast to those treated with _PROTEIN_ . these results suggest that the effect of _PROTEIN_ on actin mf polymerization is complex.figure

determine the effect of _PROTEIN_ on the asymmetric pm localization of _PROTEIN_ we treated a _METHOD_ sensor line _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ or with _METHOD_ . the sensor line _PROTEIN_ a driven _PROTEIN_ binding tubby c fused with citrine _PROTEIN_ . as shown by other _PROTEIN_ sensors _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was asymmetrically localized at the pm of initiation sites in trichoblasts . during hair elongation _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ its asymmetric pm localization at the apical region . application of _PROTEIN_ significantly redistributed _METHOD_ signals from the pm to _LOCATION_ suggesting abolished _PROTEIN_ at the pm . for root hairs either at the initiation stage or at the elongating stage _PROTEIN_ was detected mostly in the cytoplasm and hardly at all at the pm . the residual signals at the pm were uniform rather than asymmetric .figure _PROTEIN_ treatment re distributed the _PROTEIN_ sensor from the pm to the cytoplasm in root hairs . a. _METHOD_ treated root hairs

distribution in tip growing plant cells are regulated by or associated with rop _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ that are subjected to palmitoylation we wondered if _PROTEIN_ treatment could redistribute rop _PROTEIN_ into the cytoplasm or cause an uniform localization at the pm rather than the apex restricted pm localization in root hairs _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . to this end we applied either _METHOD_ or _PROTEIN_ to _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ transgenic seedlings in which _PROTEIN_ the key rop _PROTEIN_ regulating root hair growth _PROTEIN_ was driven by a root hair specific promoter _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ was concentrated at the pm of hair initiation sites in trichoblasts of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ transgenic seedlings treated with _METHOD_ as previously reported _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ caused root hair bulging . likely due to the overexpression effect ectopic _PROTEIN_ signals were detected along the pm as well as in the cortical cytoplasm . by contrast _PROTEIN_ treatment induced rapid re localization of _PROTEIN_ from the pm to the cytoplasm . significant differences were observed as early as min after _PROTEIN_ treatment .figure _PROTEIN_ treatment relocalizes

exocytosis to deliver building materials for _LOCATION_ and cell walls . in arabidopsis root hairs _PROTEIN_ mediated secretory vesicles form an inverted cone shaped pattern critical for _PROTEIN_ growth . to determine the effect of _PROTEIN_ on _PROTEIN_ positive post _LOCATION_ secretion we applied either _PROTEIN_ or _METHOD_ to dag seedlings transformed with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . as reported previously _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was dynamically distributed to the apical cytoplasm in the form of an inverted cone with a trail in growing root hairs which was not disturbed by _METHOD_ . such a distribution pattern was dynamically _PROTEIN_ as long as root hairs grew . application of _PROTEIN_ incurred two noticeable effects in root hairs it disrupted the tip focused inverted cone pattern and caused aggregation of _PROTEIN_ positive vesicles . the effects of _PROTEIN_ were observed as early as hr after treatment suggesting that post _LOCATION_ secretory trafficking was sensitive to the inhibition of protein palmitoylation . disruption of the tip focused _PROTEIN_ distribution pattern correlated with the growth kinetics of root hairs in that _PROTEIN_ was more concentrated in the apical region than in the shank region in growing root hairs whereas completely dissipated into punctates in non growing root hairs . despite the disruption on _PROTEIN_ positive secretory trafficking by following single aggregates during time lapse confocal _METHOD_ microscopy we observed that at least some vesicles were able to be exocytosed .figure _PROTEIN_ treatment interfered with the

was affected because _PROTEIN_ growth requires balanced exocytosis and endocytosis to _PROTEIN_ the dynamic integrity of the cell _LOCATION_ and walls . enters into plant cells through the pm by endocytosis and eventually reaches the tonoplast . to determine whether _PROTEIN_ interfered with endocytic trafficking we pre treated dag seedlings with _PROTEIN_ or _METHOD_ for hrs before pulse labeling the roots with . in both initiating and elongating root hairs pre treated with _METHOD_ was internalized from the pm into the tgn/ee . by contrast no _LOCATION_ vesicles were observed in root hairs pre treated with _PROTEIN_ during the time course of the experiment either in initiating root hairs or in elongated root hairs indicating complete inhibition of endocytosis.figure _PROTEIN_

treatment we followed the endocytic trafficking of to the tonoplast . labeled both _LOCATION_ vesicles and the tonoplast after min uptake in root hairs . because bfa treatment caused aggregation of labeled tgn/ee into bfa compartments we reasoned that a bfa washout would allow us to examine the process of _LOCATION_ trafficking from tgn/ee via pvc/mvb to _LOCATION_ . in root hairs treated with _METHOD_ bfa washout led to the labeling of of the tonoplast indicating undisturbed trafficking from the tgn/ee to _LOCATION_ . however in the presence of _PROTEIN_ bfa washout resulted in dissipation of signals from the bfa compartments . furthermore was redistributed mostly to the pm rather than to the tonoplast suggesting that _PROTEIN_ caused mis sorting of vesicles originally destined to

_PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . because _PROTEIN_ goes to _LOCATION_ for degradation through _LOCATION_ trafficking routes from tgn/ee to pvc/mvb we reasoned that this would serve as a good biosensor for _LOCATION_ trafficking _PROTEIN_ . indeed _PROTEIN_ but not _METHOD_ induced the formation of _PROTEIN_ shaped compartments positive for _PROTEIN_ to an extent similar to but less substantial than that caused by wortmannin through which pvc/mvbs on their way to _LOCATION_ fuse to form _PROTEIN_ shaped compartments _PROTEIN_ . these results indicated that _LOCATION_ trafficking through the tgn/ee and pvc/mvbs was compromised by _PROTEIN_ .
the t dna insertion line _PROTEIN_ was obtained from the arabidopsis biological resource center _PROTEIN_ . primers were used to characterize _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ . arabidopsis thaliana col ecotype was used as wild type . arabidopsis plants were grown as described . for seedlings growing on plates surface sterilized arabidopsis seeds were grown on murashige and skoog basal medium with vitamins _METHOD_ except where noted . plates were kept at in darkness for days before being transferred to a growth chamber with a h light h dark cycle at . transgenic plants were selected on _METHOD_ medium supplemented with basta salt . all vectors were generated using the technology . entry vectors for the coding sequence of _PROTEIN_ and the whole genomic sequence of _PROTEIN_ including its native promoter were generated in the pentry/sd/d topo using the primer pair for _PROTEIN_ and for _PROTEIN_ . the destination vector gw _METHOD_ was generated by replacing the promoter with using the primer pair with the spei/hindiii double digestion sites from a previously described destination vector . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was generated by an lr reaction using a gw _METHOD_ translation fusion destination vector and the _PROTEIN_ entry vector . _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was generated by a lr reaction using the _METHOD_ gw destination vector and the entry vector for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . all pcr amplifications used phusiontm hot start high fidelity dna polymerase with the annealing temperature and extension times recommended by the manufacturer . all entry vectors were sequenced and verified . the bioneer pcr purification kit and the bioneer spin miniprep kit were used for pcr product recovery and plasmid dna extraction respectively . primers are listed in . in the presence of _PROTEIN_ or _METHOD_ the region of root growth and root hair expansion was mm distal from the primary root tip of dag seedlings and was thus chosen for length and width measurements . images of that region were taken from individual seedlings using an axio observer equipped with a ccd camera . quantification of root hair length and width was performed according to previous descriptions _PROTEIN_ using imagej . stock solutions of various inhibitors were prepared using _METHOD_ as the solvent at the following concentrations mm _PROTEIN_ mm bfa mm chx and mm . stock solutions were diluted and added to _METHOD_ at designated final concentrations i.e . _PROTEIN_ bfa chx and . _METHOD_ was similarly diluted for the controls . all experiments were repeated at least three times . images and movies shown are representative of approximately root hairs . _METHOD_ images were captured using a leica tcs confocal laser scanning microscope with a plan neofluar oil dic objective or oil dic objectives . _METHOD_ _METHOD_ double labeled plant materials were captured alternately using line switching with the multi track function _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . _METHOD_ was detected using a to nm band pass filter for _METHOD_ and a to nm band pass filter for _METHOD_ . _METHOD_ _METHOD_ double labeled plant materials were captured alternately using line switching with the multi track function _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . _METHOD_ was detected using a to nm band pass filter for _METHOD_ and a to nm band pass filter for _METHOD_ . post acquisition image processing was performed with the _PROTEIN_ af lite image processing software . for quantification of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ regions of interest of same sizes were designated at the pm the cytoplasm or the tonoplast . average signal intensity at rois was measured using imagej and ratio of the cytoplasm to the pm _PROTEIN_ the pm to the cytoplasm _PROTEIN_ or the tonoplast to the cytoplasm _PROTEIN_ was calculated . all vacuolated areas were excluded from the cytoplasm roi . arabidopsis genome initiative locus identifiers for the genes mentioned in this article are for _PROTEIN_ for _PROTEIN_ for _PROTEIN_ for _PROTEIN_ for _PROTEIN_ for _PROTEIN_ for _PROTEIN_ for _PROTEIN_ for _PROTEIN_ for _PROTEIN_ for _PROTEIN_ for _PROTEIN_ for _PROTEIN_ for _PROTEIN_ for _PROTEIN_ for _PROTEIN_ for _PROTEIN_ for _PROTEIN_ for _PROTEIN_ for _PROTEIN_ for _PROTEIN_ for _PROTEIN_ and for _PROTEIN_ .
