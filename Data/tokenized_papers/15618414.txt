proline transporters mediate transport of the compatible solutes pro glycine betaine and the stress induced compound aminobutyric acid . a new member of this gene family _PROTEIN_ was isolated from arabidopsis and its properties were compared to _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . transient _PROTEIN_ of fusions of atprot and the green _METHOD_ protein in tobacco protoplasts revealed that all three atprots were localized at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . _PROTEIN_ in a yeast mutant demonstrated that the affinity of all three atprots was highest for glycine betaine lower for pro and lowest for aminobutyric acid . relative quantification of the mrna level using real time pcr and analyses of transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ gene under control of individual atprot promoters showed that the _PROTEIN_ pattern of atprots are complementary . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was found in the phloem or phloem parenchyma cells throughout the whole plant indicative of a role in long distance transport of compatible solutes . _PROTEIN_ activity under the control of the _PROTEIN_ promoter was restricted to the epidermis and the cortex cells in roots whereas in leaves staining could be demonstrated only after wounding . in contrast _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was restricted to the above ground parts of the plant and could be localized to the epidermal cells in leaves . these results showed that although intracellular localization substrate specificity and affinity are very similar the transporters fulfill different roles in planta .
a newly identified prot homolog _GENE_ _PROTEIN_ showed the highest homology to _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . phylogenetic analysis revealed that the three arabidopsis prots form a subgroup within the prot branch of the _PROTEIN_ gene family . interestingly prot members from a single plant species always cluster together indicating that duplication of the genes was a relatively recent event . in contrast in the most closely related group of transporters of the _PROTEIN_ family the _GENE_ like proteins rice and arabidopsis proteins group together . based on their low sequence identity and their different substrate specificity we designated _GENE_ and homologs as not belonging to the prot like proteins . _PROTEIN_ encodes a protein with a molecular _METHOD_ of kd and to predicted transmembrane domains which is in agreement with predictions for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . the intron exon structure of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ is highly conserved showing seven exons of comparable length . the _PROTEIN_ difference was found in the length of the first intron which is considerably longer in _PROTEIN_ . the arabidopsis genome also contains two partial prot genes on bacterial artificial chromosome clone and that are highly homologous to _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ respectively . as the conserved region on bac is relatively short and the prot homolog on bac contains point mutations leading to a frameshift and an additional stop codon both homologs do not encode functional pro transporters . therefore in arabidopsis only three functional prots are present . to discover whether the arabidopsis prots show redundancy of function the _PROTEIN_ patterns and the biochemical properties were compared . to determine whether _PROTEIN_ differs in its substrate specificity from _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ cdna was isolated by reverse transcription pcr . subsequently _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ under the control of the strong _PROTEIN_ promoter _PROTEIN_ in the yeast strain . this strain carries mutations in the general amino acid pro _PROTEIN_ and the gaba permeases and thus is unable to grow on citrulline pro or gaba as the sole nitrogen source . as controls strain was transformed with the _PROTEIN_ vector _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ harboring the cdnas of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or the amino acid permease . growth under selective conditions showed that like _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was able to mediate growth on pro and gaba but not on citrulline . the ability to mediate transport of gaba and pro but not of citrulline distinguishes _PROTEIN_ from the amino acid permeases of the aap family and also groups _PROTEIN_ to the prot family with respect to substrate specificity . to examine whether the atprots differ in their kinetic properties uptake experiments with l pro gly betaine and gaba in cells _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ were performed . previous studies described _PROTEIN_ as a transporter with higher affinity for pro than for gaba . however the affinity of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ for gly betaine a substrate for from tomato and the prot homologs from mangrove as well as the kinetic properties of _PROTEIN_ had not been determined so far . transport assays showed that all three atprots were able to mediate uptake of labeled pro gly betaine and gaba . the affinity of all atprots was highest for gly betaine intermediate for pro and lowest for gaba . the affinity of _PROTEIN_ for gly betaine was to times the affinity of _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ and the affinity of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ for pro was times that of _PROTEIN_ . in contrast the km values for gaba were in a similar range for all three transporters . the maximal transport velocities can only be compared for different substrates of a single transporter because transport rates do not only depend on the intrinsic properties of the transport protein but also on the number of transporters present at the yeast _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . in general for all three transporters higher affinity correlated with lower capacity and vice versa . for the prot homologs _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ from mangrove sodium and potassium ions have been shown to enhance transport activity . however no increased atprot mediated transport rates could be measured by the addition of sodium chloride to the assay medium . comparison of the affinities of all three atprots for pro gly betaine and gaba the uptake of radiolabeled substrates was determined in cells _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ . the ph of the assay medium was . uptake rates were determined at five different substrate concentrations and the apparent affinities and maximal transport rates were determined . values represent the mean of at least three experiments sd . functional complementation of the yeast pro/gaba transport mutant by the atprots showed that the protein is localized at the yeast _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . however their cellular localization in planta has not been demonstrated so far . therefore fusion proteins of atprots with green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ were transiently _PROTEIN_ in tobacco protoplasts under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus promoter . _METHOD_ images obtained by confocal laser scanning microscopy showed that the signal from the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion proteins was present as a single _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ at the periphery of the protoplast indicative of its localization at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ also localized to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ but in addition the protoplasts showed some _METHOD_ _METHOD_ on internal _LOCATION_ . similar results were obtained for the atprot _METHOD_ fusions . free _METHOD_ localized to the _LOCATION_ . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis was extremely weak and hardly detectable by rna gel blot analysis . relative quantification using real time pcr with the ubiquitin mrna as a reference demonstrated that _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ in flowers and to very low levels in leaves and _METHOD_ . _PROTEIN_ transcripts could not be detected in roots . quantification of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mrna levels confirmed results from rna gel blot analyses . _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in roots was several fold higher than in other organs whereas _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was highest in flowers _METHOD_ and roots . in all organs analyzed the _PROTEIN_ mrna was the least abundant of all the atprots . to study the tissue specificity of atprot _PROTEIN_ throughout plant development and regulation under stress conditions upstream regions of the respective genes were isolated and fused to the escherichia coli _PROTEIN_ gene . arabidopsis was transformed and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ independent transgenic lines were analyzed for reporter gene activity . gus activity was initially analyzed in leaves flowers and siliques of basta resistant plants and in basta resistant seedlings of the generation . for each construct more than of the independent lines showed very similar patterns of _PROTEIN_ varying only in the intensity of gus staining . three representative lines of each construct were used to determine the _PROTEIN_ pattern in more detail using both tissue culture and soil grown plants of the generation . transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ the uida gene under the control of the _PROTEIN_ promoter showed strong reporter gene activity in the vascular tissue of leaves petioles roots flowers siliques and _METHOD_ of axenically grown seedlings or mature soil grown plants . the _PROTEIN_ in the vascular tissue strongly indicates that _PROTEIN_ is important for long distance transport . in leaves the vascular tissue of both minor and major veins was stained . cross sections through leaves showed that gus activity is confined to the phloem or phloem parenchyma cells . in addition the vascular tissue of sepals _PROTEIN_ and stamens showed reporter gene activity . this staining pattern could also be found in siliques showing strong gus activity in the vascular strands of the carpels and the funiculi whereas the seeds _METHOD_ did not show _PROTEIN_ . in roots staining was not detectable in the root tip and was weak in newly emerging _PROTEIN_ roots . cross sections of roots showed that _PROTEIN_ is restricted to phloem or phloem parenchyma cells . in both seedlings and mature plants the _PROTEIN_ promoter directed _PROTEIN_ in root tissue . in addition _PROTEIN_ of axenically grown plants showed staining . under normal growth conditions no gus activity was observed in other tissues . macroscopically gus activity was detected over the entire root including root hairs the root tip and the root cap . however cross sections of roots showed that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ did not overlap with _PROTEIN_ promoter activity because gus activity in _PROTEIN_ gus plants was confined to the epidermis and the cortex cells and absent from the stele . _PROTEIN_ mrna levels were previously shown to be elevated under salt stress . we confirmed these findings with independent experiments in this study . however no increase in gus activity was observed when _PROTEIN_ gus plants were subjected to different stress treatments such as high salt concentrations low humidity or low temperature . also quantitative gus assays of salt treated plants did not reveal significant induction of promoter activity . the _PROTEIN_ promoter contains an abscisic acid responsive element which in other genes has been shown to function as a cis element in aba responsive transcription under water stress . however aba treatment did not have any effect on _PROTEIN_ promoter activity . interestingly _PROTEIN_ gus activity was induced by mechanical wounding both in detached leaves and in leaves of intact plants and this effect was increased in the presence of salt . the uida gene under the control of the _PROTEIN_ promoter showed an _PROTEIN_ pattern complementary to _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . reporter gene _PROTEIN_ under the control of the _PROTEIN_ promoter could be detected in leaves flowers and siliques however it was absent from roots thus confirming the mrna quantification experiments . in leaves staining was strongest in younger leaves . very weakly _PROTEIN_ lines showed staining predominantly in hydathodes and trichomes whereas in lines with stronger _PROTEIN_ gus staining was detectable in the whole leaf blade but absent around the midvein . cross sections showed that in leaves gus activity under the control of the _PROTEIN_ promoter was confined to the epidermal cells and was higher in the lower epidermis than in the upper epidermis . in flowers staining was strongest in sepals and _PROTEIN_ . in siliques only the carpels were stained . no _PROTEIN_ was detectable in seeds . specificity of promoter activity was _PROTEIN_ in transgenic tobacco lines . gus activity was detected in the vascular tissue of leaves and roots in _PROTEIN_ gus lines in roots of _PROTEIN_ gus seedlings and in the leaf blade of _PROTEIN_ gus transgenics .
