_PROTEIN_ anhydrases are metalloenzymes that catalyse the reversible hydration of _PROTEIN_ . we investigated the and families in arabidopsis which contain eight and six genes . analyses of _PROTEIN_ sequence tags from the arabidopsis information resource database indicate that all the encoding sequences but only three of the are _PROTEIN_ . using pcr experiments functional ca genes were more strongly _PROTEIN_ in green tissue but strong _PROTEIN_ was also found in roots for and . two genes were shown to respond to the _PROTEIN_ environment while the others were unresponsive . using the green _METHOD_ reporter protein gene fused with cdna sequences coding for we provided evidence that were targeted to specific subcellular compartments and were targeted to the chloroplast and to the _LOCATION_ to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and to the mitochondria . the targeting and the pattern of gene _PROTEIN_ suggest that ca _METHOD_ play specific roles in subcellular compartments tissues and organs . the data indicate that other ca _METHOD_ than the may contribute to the _PROTEIN_ transfer in the cell to the catalytic site of ribulose _PROTEIN_ .
to identify the arabidopsis and gene families an extensive search of the arabidopsis genomic sequences was performed using blast and fasta _METHOD_ and using diverse and sequences as initial query sequences . eight and six encoding sequences were retrieved . table shows the list of the ca genes indicating their identification numbers _PROTEIN_ and where applicable previous gene designation . to determine the proteins encoded by the and the genes the gene structure and the exon intron organization had first to be confirmed . where possible reverse transcriptase pcr products were sequenced and compared to cdna sequences retrieved from the arabidopsis information resource the mips and the riken web sites . with this combined approach we identified the and genes unambiguously . we were not able to amplify any transcript of therefore exon intron splice sites were predicted using genescan and based on the most favourable similarity to the characteristic protein structure . and amino acid sequences were deduced from the cdna sequences . figures and show multiple sequence alignments of arabidopsis and gene products respectively . the sequence of the extensively characterized human isoenzyme ii and pea were aligned in parallel for comparison to the arabidopsis and sequences respectively . the sequence alignments show that the ca sequences contain the key features of and . the sequence alignment reveals that all of the protein sequences contain the three histidine residues and most of the residues predicted to form the network to solvent molecules in mammalian isoenzymes . the amino acid residues that have been shown either to constitute zn ligands or to orientate towards zn appeared highly conserved in the sequences . these findings suggest that the products of all the arabidopsis and genes are functional enzymes . considerable sequence identity exists between the different protein members of the and family sequences . however several ca sequences contain distinct extensions that can correspond to target peptides suggesting that the different _METHOD_ are addressed to specific cell compartments . a search of the tair database indicated that ests have been deposited for three of the eight and all of the six encoding genes signifying that the genes are functional . the lack of ests for and although a cdna sequence was released for might indicate that these genes were pseudogenes or that they were _PROTEIN_ at very low levels and/or that the conditions used in generating ests data were limiting and did not include the conditions under which these genes were _PROTEIN_ or that the corresponding gene transcripts were not stable . to determine the _PROTEIN_ pattern of each member of the and gene family analysis was performed on rna isolated from leaves _METHOD_ flowers siliques and roots of plants . figure shows agarose gel analyses of products . transcript for actin was used as internal control . to avoid detecting dna contamination primers spanning an intron were designed . the correct identities of the pcr products were confirmed by sequencing . for three different products were obtained following amplification with primers however identity of the major band as product was confirmed . no pcr product was obtained following amplification with specific primers as expected according to the lack of ests in the databases . the and genes were _PROTEIN_ strongly _PROTEIN_ in the aboveground tissues with almost no _PROTEIN_ in roots . transcripts of and were detected in all parts of the plant but at a lower level in roots . as expected from the ests data only the _PROTEIN_ of and was detected in arabidopsis plants . the transcript of was detected in all organs except roots while is _PROTEIN_ only in _METHOD_ and roots and _PROTEIN_ is restricted to flowers and siliques . we tested if changes in environmental _PROTEIN_ concentration altered and gene _PROTEIN_ . plants were grown either at low or high _PROTEIN_ concentrations . gene _PROTEIN_ levels were quantified by in leaves and compared to plants grown under air _PROTEIN_ concentration . the transcript for actin was used as internal control . as shown in fig . the _PROTEIN_ of most genes was insensitive to both _PROTEIN_ conditions . only the _PROTEIN_ of appeared slightly but significantly enhanced when plants were grown under high _PROTEIN_ conditions . contrary to whose transcript level remained unaffected by _PROTEIN_ regime and _PROTEIN_ was stimulated when the plants were grown in low _PROTEIN_ concentration . to uncover the possible potential subcellular localization of the products of atca genes _PROTEIN_ in leaves we searched for different signatures specific to cellular compartments using targetp predotar and psort softwares for . the results predicted and to have chloroplastic target peptides . was predicted to be targeted to mitochondria . prediction indicated no preferred localization subcompartment for and . in order to determine the subcellular localization of the ca encoded by the six genes we used _METHOD_ as a reporter . individual cdna encoding the full protein sequence were cloned in frame with the _METHOD_ . the resulting transgenes were _PROTEIN_ under the control of the promoter in stably transformed arabidopsis plants . _PROTEIN_ of the fusion proteins was analysed using a confocal laser scanning microscope . in mesophyll cells of transgenic plants the _METHOD_ signal fused to or with chlorophyll _METHOD_ indicating its association with chloroplast . in plants _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was emitted in the _LOCATION_ . to allow a better evidence that the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ originated from the _LOCATION_ protoplasts from plant _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ were used . for _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was monitored in epidermal cells where the signal appeared as a thin line at the cell periphery suggesting a localization in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . protoplasts prepared from transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ supported that the localization of was restricted to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . in plants _PROTEIN_ the _METHOD_ construct _METHOD_ was localized to small particules which we supposed to be mitochondria . leaves fragments were infiltrated with mitotracker merging _METHOD_ and mitotracker _METHOD_ confirmed mitochondria targeting of .
arabidopsis thaliana plants were potted in soil and grown in controlled environments under an photoperiod of m s . day/night temperature and relative humidity were and respectively . for tissue _PROTEIN_ assays tissues were harvested on silique ripening plants . for the _PROTEIN_ experiments plants were grown in _PROTEIN_ environmental chambers with _PROTEIN_ concentration set at or . the general design of the chambers including the temperature and hygrometry control and the _PROTEIN_ regulation was extensively described . total rna was extracted from mg of frozen sample using rneasy plant minikit and was treated with rnase free dnase set to eliminate any genomic dna contamination . cdna synthesis was performed with total rna using omniscript rt kit and oligo as primer . pcr conditions were cycles of for s for s and for s. reactions were run in a gene amp pcr system cycler . the following specific primer pairs were designed in different exon sequences thus the cdna could be distinguished from genomic dna and and and and and and and and and and and and and and . as control was performed using actin primers and . analysis of ca transcripts in different plant tissues and in leaves of plants exposed to varied _PROTEIN_ concentrations were repeated four and two times respectively . total leaf rna extraction cdna synthesis and pcr were carried out as for transcript analysis . all constructs were made using gateway cloning technology according to the manufacturer 's instructions . the cdna of each of the six genes was amplified using primers allowing the addition of attb recombination sites and was cloned into a vector using a gateway _PROTEIN_ clonase enzyme mix technology . one entry clone was fully sequenced before subsequent cloning in frame with an enhanced green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ gene in the binary gateway destination vector _METHOD_ by using a gateway lr clonase enzyme mix . the vector allows fusion of _METHOD_ with the ca c terminus and _PROTEIN_ of the resulting cdna is placed under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus promoter and of the untranslated transcribed region of a nopaline synthase gene . the binary constructs were introduced into the agrobacterium tumefaciens strain and the resulting bacterial cultures were used to transform arabidopsis ecotype by the standard flower dip method . . whenever necessary protoplasts were isolated in a solution of cellulases _PROTEIN_ and macerozyme _PROTEIN_ dissolved in acid buffer containing mm and mm mannitol . following overnight digestion protoplasts were collected by centrifugation at g for min . images of green _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and chlorophyll red _METHOD_ were monitored using a confocal laser scaning microscope with a nm argon laser excitation . objective hcx plan apo cs oil was used . the _METHOD_ signals were collected from to nm for _METHOD_ and from to nm for chlorophyll . for mitochondria detection just before observation small leaf fragments wereinfiltrated with the dye mitotracker red . excitation was performed at nm using a laser diode and _METHOD_ collected from to nm .
