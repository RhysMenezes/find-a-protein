upon penetration of the host cell wall the powdery mildew fungus develops a feeding structure named the haustorium in the invaded host cell . concomitant with haustorial biogenesis the extrahaustorial _LOCATION_ is formed to separate the haustorium from the host cell cytoplasm . the arabidopsis resistance protein is specifically targeted to the ehm where it activates haustorium targeted resistance against powdery mildew . belongs to a small family with six members in arabidopsis . whether homologs of to _PROTEIN_ are also localized to the ehm and contribute to resistance has not been determined . here we report that overexpression of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ led to enhanced resistance to powdery mildew while genetic depletion of _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ resulted in enhanced susceptibility indicating that these homologs contribute to basal resistance . interestingly we found that n terminally _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ to _PROTEIN_ are also ehm localized . this suggests that ehm targeting is an ancestral feature of the family . indeed two homologs from brassica oleracea tested also exhibit ehm localization . domain swapping analysis between _PROTEIN_ and suggests that sequence diversification in the n terminal amino acids of probably functionally distinguishes it from other family members . moreover we found that n terminally _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ is also localized to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and the fungal penetration site in addition to the ehm . using this unique feature of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ we obtained preliminary evidence to suggest that the ehm is unlikely derived from invagination of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ rather it may be _PROTEIN_ synthesized de novo .
the gene locus in arabidopsis _METHOD_ accession contains and and three homologs of designated _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . the powdery mildew susceptible accession col lacks and but contains _PROTEIN_ in the same location along with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . because col mutants including those that are defective in salicylic acid signaling display enhanced disease susceptibility to powdery mildew we reasoned that col is still capable of mounting a certain level of sa dependent and perhaps sa independent basal resistance . to test if _PROTEIN_ to _PROTEIN_ play a role in basal resistance in col we first overexpressed _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ using the promoter together with the native regulatory sequence _PROTEIN_ a demonstrated strategy shown to effectively achieve higher _PROTEIN_ of and in col gl . for each dna construct > transgenic plants were generated and five independent homozygous lines in the or generation were tested with a well _PROTEIN_ powdery mildew isolate golovinomyces cichoracearum . plants of all tested lines transgenic for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ displayed obvious enhanced diseases resistance compared to col gl whereas plants transgenic for _PROTEIN_ were as susceptible as col gl . reverse transcription pcr confirmed that _PROTEIN_ levels of the four homologs were much higher in the transgenic lines than the respective endogenous genes in col gl . these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ but not _PROTEIN_ may contribute to basal resistance in col against powdery mildew . next we identified one t dna knockdown line for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ one knockout line for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and two knockout lines for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ based on rt pcr results . plants of these mutant lines were inoculated with gc along with plants of col and col nahg a transgenic line _PROTEIN_ a bacterial sa hydrolase . except for _PROTEIN_ the remaining three t dna lines exhibited a small but reproducible increase in fungal spores on the leaf surface d postinoculation when compared to col although they were not as susceptible as col nahg . disease quantification showed that plants of the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutant lines produced approximately to approximately more fungal spores than col while col nahg supported nearly twice as many spores as col at dpi indicating that genetic depletion of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ results in enhanced disease susceptibility albeit at a lower degree compared to sa depletion by the sa hydrolase encoded by nahg . these results together with the data from overexpression analyses demonstrate that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ probably contribute to basal resistance against powdery mildew . in a recent study we found that two r/k r/k x r/k motifs comprise the core ehm targeting signal in . sequence analysis showed that while the first ets has some variations the second ets is highly conserved among all the family members in arabidopsis and three homologs from b. oleracea . thus we wondered if other arabidopsis family members are also ehm resident proteins . _METHOD_ has shown to be _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in mesophyll cells when _PROTEIN_ from its native promoter . interestingly when _PROTEIN_ from the promoter _METHOD_ was also found to be ehm localized . to examine subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ to _PROTEIN_ each of these genes was translationally fused with _METHOD_ at the c terminus and the fusion constructs were stably _PROTEIN_ in col gl by their respective nps . unexpectedly we were unable to detect any _METHOD_ signal before or after inoculation with gc from at least independent transgenic lines examined for each construct despite the detection of the transgene _PROTEIN_ by rt pcr in two representative lines per construct . western blotting using an anti _METHOD_ antibody recognizing _METHOD_ also revealed no protein accumulation in any of these lines . while plants transgenic for np _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ np _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or np _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ appeared phenotypically normal in growth and development and were susceptible to powdery mildew approximately of plants transgenic for np _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ exhibited stunted growth with leaf necrosis and varied degree of enhanced resistance to gc . these observations suggest that these fusion proteins can not accumulate to levels detectable by confocal microscopy or western blotting and that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ is also toxic when stably _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis . to make sure that these fusion constructs are translated into proteins we transiently _PROTEIN_ them in nicotiana benthamiana leaves by agroinfiltration . again no _METHOD_ signal was detectable . we then transiently coexpressed each of the constructs with the coat protein of turnip crinkle virus that also functions to suppress rna silencing in host plants . interestingly except for np _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ the remaining three constructs produced detectable albeit weak _METHOD_ signal . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ appeared to be localized in the pm in epidermal cells punctate spots were also seen around chloroplasts in mesophyll cells . however _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was _PROTEIN_ found in the _PROTEIN_ structures surrounding chloroplasts in mesophyll cells which is reminiscent of _METHOD_ s localization in mesophyll cells . moreover consistent with cell death in arabidopsis lines transgenic for np _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ we found _METHOD_ necrosis from the leaf section infiltrated with np _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ only demonstrating that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ is capable of triggering cell death in both arabidopsis and n. benthamiana . taken together these observations suggest that homologs appear to be distinct from in _METHOD_ of protein function and accumulation . given that an _PROTEIN_ like gene is the probable progenitor of the gene family we investigated how might have functionally diversified from _PROTEIN_ via the following three aspects . first we _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ from the promoter in the col gl background . we found that approximately of transgenic plants showed strong or lethal cell death suggesting that the promoter is stronger than that of _PROTEIN_ . again _METHOD_ signal was not detected in any of these transgenic lines even before onset of cell death . second because substitution of asp at to gly in abolishes triggered hypersensitive response and resistance and is conserved in _PROTEIN_ we thus made the mutation in _PROTEIN_ and stably _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein from the _PROTEIN_ promoter . we found that this mutation did not affect _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ triggered cell death despite that the fusion protein remained undetectable . this suggests that hypersensitive response cell death activated by is mechanistically distinct from the necrotic cell death caused by _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . third because both and contain a shorter c terminus compared to _PROTEIN_ and the c terminus sdds of appears to be required or full scale interaction with we made an _PROTEIN_ variant with a truncation of the c terminal amino acids and the _PROTEIN_ to d substitution to make an sdds c terminus as seen in such that the resultant _PROTEIN_ mutant most structurally resembles . also in another construct we removed the c terminal amino acids of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ to see if it can make the fusion protein more stable . however in both cases cell death still occurred in respective transgenic plants without detectable _METHOD_ signal . based on these results we reasoned that the n terminal portion of _PROTEIN_ is responsible for inappropriate cell death activated by _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and lack of protein accumulation at a detectable level by microscopy when the c terminal portion is perturbed _METHOD_ . we speculated that these properties of _PROTEIN_ might have been lost in as part of its functional diversification from an _PROTEIN_ like progenitor . to further test the above speculation we made chimeric constructs by swapping the n and c terminal domains of and _PROTEIN_ which are designated _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ as shown in figure a and b. interestingly _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was nicely localized to the ehm and conferred resistance to gc in a similar manner as _METHOD_ whereas _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was still undetectable and lost ability to trigger cell death or resistance . these results suggest that is essential for protein stability defense and ehm localization of while is replaceable which is compatible with results from our recent mutational analysis of may be able to suppress _PROTEIN_ mediated inappropriate cell death and/or that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ can not accumulate to a level sufficient for triggering cell death . however a more detailed structure function analysis between _PROTEIN_ and is needed to further define the molecular and evolutionary _METHOD_ underlying the functional diversification between these two proteins . because _PROTEIN_ has more likely retained the original conserved function of the _PROTEIN_ like progenitor gene whereas has apparently evolved novel resistance function we also wondered if _PROTEIN_ is required for mediated resistance . to test this we introduced the _PROTEIN_ allele to a col gl transgenic for a single copy of a genomic fragment containing and and their nps by crossing . we found that plants were as resistant as plants indicating that _PROTEIN_ is dispensable for activated resistance . from the above analysis we were unable to determine if the homologs are also ehm resident proteins due to the unknown intrinsic constraints associated with c terminal _METHOD_ tagging . neither did we succeed in detection of internally _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ by microscopy . previously we reported that n terminally _METHOD_ tagged _METHOD_ was also targeted to the ehm despite its loss of function in defense . we thus made n terminally _METHOD_ tagged dna constructs for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and stably _PROTEIN_ them from the promoter in col gl . while _METHOD_ signal was still not detectable from any of over transgenic lines _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signal from the remaining three fusion constructs appeared to be distributed in the cytoplasm and possibly in the pm . to see if the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion protein can be made we transiently _PROTEIN_ the construct in n. benthamiana leaves and detected _METHOD_ signal along the cell wall possibly in the pm . these results suggest that n terminally _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ is unable to accumulate in stable transgenic arabidopsis plants which is different from those of the other family members . to determine if the observed _METHOD_ signal from _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was indeed in the pm we transiently coexpressed _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ with an arabidopsis pm aquaporin _PROTEIN_ in fusion with mcherry in n. benthamiana leaf cells . we found that _METHOD_ signal nicely colocalized with mcherry signal indicating that n terminally _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ is localized to the pm . we then inoculated respective transgenic lines with gc to examine the localization of these fusion proteins in epidermal cells invaded by haustoria . interestingly we found that _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ appeared to be preferentially or exclusively localized to the ehm in epidermal cells invaded by haustoria similar to our observation with _METHOD_ . the ehm localization of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ is confirmed by precise colocalization with _METHOD_ at the ehm . moreover _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ signal remained detectable at the ehm of isolated haustorial complexes extracted from infected leaves coexpressing _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ . to exclude the possibility that ehm localization was caused by overexpression of the fusion protein we also generated transgenic lines _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ from the promoter . as expected _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was mostly confined to haustorium invaded epidermal cells and _METHOD_ signals were mostly or exclusively found in the ehm . to test if _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ is also localized to the ehm we inoculated _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ n. benthamiana leaves with gc which is weakly infectious on n. benthamiana . we also observed _METHOD_ signal as small punctae around the haustorium as well as in the cytoplasm . all transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ these fusion proteins were as susceptible as col gl to gc agreeing with the nonfunctional nature of these fusion proteins in defense as seen for _METHOD_ . to rule out the possibility that _LOCATION_ proteins may be targeted by default to the ehm in the haustorium invaded cells during the biogenesis of the ehm we _PROTEIN_ the pm localized _LOCATION_ protein _PROTEIN_ tagged with _METHOD_ from the promoter in col gl . _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ showed exclusive pm localization in haustorium invaded cells indicating that ehm targeting of the _METHOD_ tagged homologs is attributable to the properties of these proteins rather than a consequence of activation of a default ehm oriented trafficking pathway . intriguingly we also noticed that _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ showed focal accumulation around the fungal penetration site where a callosic papilla is formed . this localization pattern is reminiscent of _PROTEIN_ a syntaxin involved in penetration . to determine the precise localization of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in relation to the papilla we stained callose in the papilla by sirofluor and found that _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was not precisely colocalized with callose as it was more concentrated in the middle and the rim of the bull s eye shaped callosic papilla . interestingly we never observed signal from _METHOD_ _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ _METHOD_ in the papilla . these observations suggest that papilla localization of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ is attributable to _PROTEIN_ and may reflect a cellular function of _PROTEIN_ that is distinct from . homologs of exist in brassica species but their biological functions have not been determined . to test if ehm and papilla localization is indeed an ancestral feature of the protein family we made and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion constructs for two homologs from b. oleracea bohra and bohrb from the promoter in arabidopsis . we found that over lines transgenic for bohra _METHOD_ or bohrb _METHOD_ had greatly reduced plant stature with spontaneous cell death lesions and powdery mildew resistance suggesting that these brassica homologs probably contribute to basal resistance against powdery mildew . interestingly unlike _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ signal from bohra _METHOD_ albeit weaker compared with _METHOD_ was detectable in powdery mildew invaded cells as puncta mostly around the haustorium with strong accumulation in the fungal penetration site . however we never observed strong diffuse _METHOD_ signal from bohra _METHOD_ at the ehm highlighting a clear difference from _METHOD_ . as expected all the lines transgenic for _METHOD_ bohra or _METHOD_ bohrb were suscepible to gc and the fusion proteins were also found in the papilla and the ehm . these observations further support that the ehm targeting and papilla location feature had likely evolved in homologs before the separation of brassica and arabidopsis . considering the gradual _PROTEIN_ process of powdery mildew it _METHOD_ likely that during the arabidopsis powdery mildew coevolutionary conflict has gained ehm focused localization while losing its papilla localization . triple localization of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ of its relevance to the physiological functions of _PROTEIN_ may provide a unique tool to interrogate the origin and biogenesis of the ehm and how these _LOCATION_ compartments might be physically connected with or separated from each other . to test if the ehm is separable from the pm and the papilla we made transgenic plants coexpressing _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ from the promoter and _METHOD_ from the promoter . constitutive _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ allows pm labeling by _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ before powdery mildew infection and possible direct _PROTEIN_ diffusion or translocalization of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ from the pm to the ehm during haustorial biogenesis . leaf sections inoculated with gc were prepared at dpi and subjected to plasmolysis . interestingly in some cells the shrunk cytoplasm with the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ labeled pm was pulled off the cell wall but got stuck at the haustorial neck wrapping around the haustorial complex with an ehm labeled by both _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ . in other cells the shrunk cytoplasm with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ labeled pm was nearly or completely torn off the haustorial complex however _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ localized at the papilla and the ehm remained unaffected . these observations demonstrate that the pm is physically separable from the ehm and the papilla and support that there indeed exists a physical barrier at the haustorial neck that fixes and separates the pm from the ehm and the papilla is an _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ compartment likely formed via exosome secretion . it is also important to note that despite that the cytoplasm in most affected cells was shrunk > times during plasmolysis the size and shape of most haustorial complexes did not seem to have significant changes suggesting that the ehm and the fungal cell wall in particular may be rigid and resistant to high osmotic pressure . to determine if _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ is targeted to the papilla and the ehm via the same or distinct intracellular trafficking pathways we first tested if there is _PROTEIN_ diffusion and/or an intracellular trafficking pathway between the pm and the ehm . is a lipophilic dye that labels the pm and tracks pm derived endosomes to various subcellular compartments in a time dependent manner in approximately min . while nicely labeled the pm in min to min after application of the dye and then was found to be colocalized with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in the papilla in approximately min did not label the ehm in min when all endosomal compartments should be labeled . however if vacuum infiltrated into the leaf tissue could immediately stain the ehm . given that the haustorial _LOCATION_ lobes and the haustorial neck in particular were more strongly stained by we speculate that the haustorial neckband as the presumable diffusion barrier is probably disrupted by vacuum infiltration resulting in diffusion of the into the extrahaustorial _PROTEIN_ from the apoplast . this observation suggests that while _LOCATION_ lipids or proteins from the pm can reach the papilla likely via an endosomal trafficking pathway there is no or little _PROTEIN_ diffusion or endosomal trafficking from the pm to the ehm . we then determined if _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ s papilla and the ehm localization can be inhibited by the same pharmacological inhibitor . it has been shown that brefeldin a a fungal toxin widely used to block multiple intracellular vesicle trafficking pathways can inhibit focal accumulation of both _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and callose deposition to the papilla . we treated leaves of plants transgenic for _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ with bfa and found that while ehm localization of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ appeared unaffected both focal accumulation of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and callose to the papilla were similarly diminished . these observations indicate that ehm oriented protein targeting and papilla focused protein accumulation are realized via two distinct trafficking pathways .
