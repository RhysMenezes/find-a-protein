arabidopsis contains about _PROTEIN_ binding cassette proteins which are likely to contribute to the transport of diverse materials including toxic substances . however the substrates of abc transporters remain unknown in most cases . we tested which abc transporter is involved in detoxification of lead . among the many tested we found that the message level of only _PROTEIN_ increased in both shoots and roots of pb treated arabidopsis suggesting that it may be involved in the detoxification of pb . _PROTEIN_ knockout plants _PROTEIN_ were used to further test this possibility . in pb containing medium _PROTEIN_ plants grew less well and had higher pb contents than those of wild type plants . in contrast _PROTEIN_ overexpressing arabidopsis plants were more resistant to pb and had lower pb contents than wild type plants . the mutant phenotypes and their pb contents as well as the localization of the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion protein at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ suggest that _PROTEIN_ functions as a pump to exclude pb and/or pb containing toxic compounds from the cytoplasm . inhibition of glutathione synthesis by addition of buthionine sulfoximine to the growth medium exacerbated the pb sensitive phenotype of _PROTEIN_ plants consistent with a glutathione dependent detoxification mechanism operating in parallel with an _PROTEIN_ dependent mechanism . thus we propose that _PROTEIN_ is an abc transporter that contributes to pb resistance in arabidopsis .
as a first step in the identification of abc transporters involved in pb transport we searched databases to select arabidopsis abc transporters with high amino acid sequence homology to abc transporters of other _METHOD_ that are reported to transport toxic substances . we then performed reverse transcription pcr experiments to test whether the transcript levels of these candidate abc transporters are up regulated when arabidopsis is treated with pb . the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ did not change much upon pb treatment whereas that of _PROTEIN_ increased both in shoots and in roots . without pb treatment the _PROTEIN_ transcript was _PROTEIN_ in shoots but not detected in roots . to test whether _PROTEIN_ contributes to pb resistance in plants we obtained seeds of _PROTEIN_ knockout alleles from the salk institute genomic analysis laboratory . these knockout plants have t dna inserted into different sites of the exon of the _PROTEIN_ gene . homozygous knockout plants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were selected by pcr using t dna specific primer and _PROTEIN_ specific primers with genomic dna as a template . the pcr using _PROTEIN_ specific primers did not produce any product but the pcr using a t dna specific primer and _PROTEIN_ specific primer produced and bp size bands from genomic dna of _PROTEIN_ and respectively as expected . these pcr products were sequenced using t dna specific primers and insertion sites were confirmed . to confirm that the homozygous lines do not have the _PROTEIN_ transcript rt pcr was performed using total rna extracted from the plants . pcr using _PROTEIN_ specific primers did not produce any product from the homozygous knockout plants as it did from wild type plants . we obtained the next generation of seeds from the selected _PROTEIN_ homozygous knockout plants and tested their resistance to pb and cd . in control medium the growth of _PROTEIN_ knockout plants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was similar to that of wild type plants and they reproduced normally . in pb containing medium the growth of roots and shoots was reduced more in _PROTEIN_ knockout plants than in wild type plants . although addition of pb may have caused some precipitation of p and s the plant _METHOD_ did not resemble those of p and s deficiency which cause dark green coloration and chlorosis of young leaves respectively . rather the pb treated plants displayed the typical symptom of pb treated plants reduced root growth . growth of _PROTEIN_ knockout plants was not different from that of wild type plants in or cd containing media or in media containing zn cu al or the antifungal drug sclareol . these results demonstrate that _PROTEIN_ specifically confers pb resistance at least under our experimental conditions . for quantitative analyses of the phenotypes we tested various concentrations of pb and chose two concentrations that showed the most striking differences between the knockout and wild type plants . figure shows the fresh weight and root length of _PROTEIN_ knockout and wild type plants grown on pb containing one half murashige and skoog _METHOD_ agar plates without and with mm or mm pb for weeks . in the control medium without additional pb _PROTEIN_ plants had fold higher fresh weight and fold higher root length than wild type plants . in contrast _PROTEIN_ plants did not display any differences in fresh weight and root length compared to wild type plants . however in pb containing media both fresh weight and root length were more severely reduced in _PROTEIN_ knockout plants than in wild type plants the fresh weights of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were reduced to and of wild type and root lengths were _PROTEIN_ to and of wild type in medium containing mm pb . we measured the pb contents of week old wild type and _PROTEIN_ knockout plants whose roots were soaked in mm pb for d. shoots of _PROTEIN_ plants contained fold more pb than those of wild type plants . although the pb content of _PROTEIN_ plants seemed slightly higher than that of wild type plants in pb containing media the difference was not statistically significant . additionally the phenotypes of _PROTEIN_ plants were less pronounced than those of _PROTEIN_ plants with respect to fresh weight and root length . we have no valid explanation for this difference except perhaps for the observation that the t dna insertion site of _PROTEIN_ is closer to the stop codon than that of _PROTEIN_ . we then examined the possibility that pb treatment of the knockout plants causes changes in the levels of other metal ions using an inductively coupled _LOCATION_ spectrometer . while potassium copper magnesium iron zinc and manganese levels remained the same the pb level was confirmed to be higher in _PROTEIN_ knockout plants _PROTEIN_ than in the wild type . if _PROTEIN_ contributes to pb resistance _PROTEIN_ overexpressing plants may be more resistant to pb than wild type plants . the _PROTEIN_ gene was inserted into the vector with a promoter _PROTEIN_ and the construct was introduced into wild type arabidopsis plants . we selected lines that had only copy of _PROTEIN_ and homozygous lines were chosen from the next generation and tested for their resistance to pb . in one half _METHOD_ control medium without pb growth of _PROTEIN_ overexpressing and wild type plants was similar . however in medium containing mm pb the shoots and roots of _PROTEIN_ overexpressing plants grew slightly better than those of wild type plants . quantitative analyses showed that the fresh weights and root lengths of _PROTEIN_ overexpressing and wild type plants were similar in control medium except for one _PROTEIN_ overexpressing line which had a slightly reduced fresh weight . in pb containing medium fresh weight and root length were consistently higher in the _PROTEIN_ overexpressing plants than in the wild type plant the fresh weight of _PROTEIN_ overexpressing lines were and fold higher than that of the wild type and root lengths of _PROTEIN_ overexpressing lines were and fold longer than that of the wild type plant . to investigate the _PROTEIN_ transcript level in _PROTEIN_ overexpressing plants total rna was extracted from pb treated _PROTEIN_ overexpressing and wild type plants . the _PROTEIN_ overexpressing plants had a higher _PROTEIN_ transcript level compared to wild type plants . to test whether _PROTEIN_ overexpressing plants had reduced pb contents compared to wild type plants _PROTEIN_ overexpressing and wild type plants were grown on mm pb containing medium for weeks and then their shoots were prepared . pb contents of independent lines of _PROTEIN_ overexpressing plants had pb contents that were and of that of wild type plants . because pb can form complexes with thiol compounds we investigated whether the pb detoxification mechanism of _PROTEIN_ is related to glutathione . to test this possibility we compared the growth of wild type and _PROTEIN_ transgenic plants in medium containing buthionine sulfoximine an inhibitor of glutathione synthesis . in control or mm bso containing media the growth rates of _PROTEIN_ overexpressing knockout _PROTEIN_ and wild type plants were similar . in mm pb containing medium _PROTEIN_ overexpressing and knockout plants showed slightly enhanced and slightly reduced growth respectively compared to the wild type plants as found in previous experiments . in medium containing both mm bso and mm pb this growth difference was even more striking than in medium containing pb alone . this amplified phenotypes under low glutathione condition indicates that _PROTEIN_ does not use glutathione for pb detoxification . to investigate the localization of _PROTEIN_ we isolated protoplasts from arabidopsis whole seedlings and introduced a green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ construct _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ into them using the polyethylene glycol transformation method . after h of incubation the _METHOD_ of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was localized at the boundary of the cell most likely the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . to confirm the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ localization we used red _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ as a control . is an arabidopsis h _PROTEIN_ that is known to localize to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . when _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ were transformed into the arabidopsis protoplasts at the same time and _PROTEIN_ were colocalized at the boundary of the cell confirming the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ localization of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ localization of _PROTEIN_ was confirmed by transforming the protoplasts with a second construct of the fused genes _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . to investigate the tissue specific _PROTEIN_ pattern of _PROTEIN_ in wild type plants we extracted total rna from each tissue and performed rt pcr . _PROTEIN_ transcripts were detected in rosette leaves _METHOD_ cauline leaves and flowers but not in roots .
seeds of arabidopsis wild type ecotype colombia _PROTEIN_ overexpressing and _PROTEIN_ knockout plants were surface sterilized placed in the dark at for d and then sown on agar plates of one half _METHOD_ with suc or in soil . for phenotype tests heavy metals and drugs were added to one half _METHOD_ medium . the full _PROTEIN_ sequence was isolated from a cdna by pcr . the cdna was synthesized using total rna extracted from pb treated roots of arabidopsis wild type plants . the primers used were _PROTEIN_ tff and _PROTEIN_ tfr . the primers contained two restriction enzyme sites for easy cloning . the pcr product was ligated into the pgem t easy vector using dna ligase . the fidelity of the _PROTEIN_ sequence was confirmed by automated dna sequencing _METHOD_ . to test _PROTEIN_ levels of abc proteins under pb stress total rna was extracted from pb treated and water treated roots of arabidopsis . rt pcr was performed using an rt pcr kit with each abc protein specific primer set . the primer sequences employed are listed in table i . as a control for rt pcr _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ primers were used . primer sequences used for rt pcr that tested transcript levels of some abc proteins of arabidopsis two alleles of _PROTEIN_ knockout arabidopsis seeds and were obtained from the salk institute genomic analysis laboratory . the seeds were sown and grown on soil for weeks after which genomic dna was extracted from the plants . homozygous _PROTEIN_ knockout plants were selected by pcr using primers . in the case of the line a t dna specific primer and _PROTEIN_ specific primers _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were used . in the case of the line a t dna specific primer and gene specific primers _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were used . to make _PROTEIN_ overexpressing plants _PROTEIN_ was fused to using the bamhi site of the vector and the construct was introduced into the agrobacterium tumefaciens strain which was used to transform arabidopsis ecotype columbia by the floral dipping method . the transformed seeds were selected on kanamycin containing one half _METHOD_ agar plates . transcripts of _PROTEIN_ overexpressing lines were detected by rt pcr using primers described in table i and total rna extracted from pb treated week old seedlings . arabidopsis plants were grown on one half _METHOD_ agar medium supplemented with suc without or with mm or mm pb for weeks or weeks . plants were collected and weighed and their root length was measured . the shoots of plants were digested with n at overnight . digested samples were diluted with n and analyzed using an atomic absorption spectrometer or inductively coupled _LOCATION_ spectrometer . to investigate _PROTEIN_ localization we made different _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion constructs an n terminal and a c terminal _METHOD_ construct which we denoted _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ respectively . the former construct was made by inserting _PROTEIN_ into the _METHOD_ vector _PROTEIN_ using the smai and sali sites and the latter construct was made by inserting _PROTEIN_ into the _METHOD_ vector _PROTEIN_ using the bamhi site . _METHOD_ was used as a _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ marker . the two constructs were introduced into arabidopsis protoplasts by the polyethylene glycol method . _PROTEIN_ of constructs was monitored using a zeiss _METHOD_ microscope . the filter sets used were filter set _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ for _METHOD_ and filter set _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ for _METHOD_ . to investigate the tissue specific rna level of _PROTEIN_ rt pcr was performed using total rna extracted from each organ . rosette leaves and roots were harvested from wild type plants grown on one half _METHOD_ plate for weeks . flowers _METHOD_ and cauline leaves were harvested from wild type plants grown in soil for weeks . sequence data from this article have been deposited with the embl/genbank data libraries under accession number .
