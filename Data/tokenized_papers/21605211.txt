nima related kinase _PROTEIN_ has been implicated in microtubule regulation to suppress the ectopic outgrowth of epidermal cells however its molecular functions remain to be elucidated . here we analyze the function of _PROTEIN_ and other members of the nek family with _PROTEIN_ to epidermal cell expansion and cortical microtubule organization . the functional _PROTEIN_ green _METHOD_ protein fusion localizes to cortical microtubules predominantly in particles that exhibit dynamic movement along microtubules . the kinase dead mutant of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ exhibits a disturbance of the cortical microtubule array at the site of ectopic protrusions in epidermal cells . pharmacological studies with microtubule inhibitors and quantitative analysis of microtubule dynamics indicate excessive stabilization of cortical microtubules in _PROTEIN_ mutants . in addition _PROTEIN_ directly binds to microtubules in vitro and phosphorylates tubulin . _PROTEIN_ interacts and co localizes with _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in a transient _PROTEIN_ assay . the _PROTEIN_ mutation markedly reduces the interaction between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and increases the interaction between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are required for the _PROTEIN_ ectopic outgrowth phenotype in epidermal cells . these results demonstrate that _PROTEIN_ homodimerizes and _METHOD_ heterodimers with _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ to regulate cortical microtubule organization possibly through the phosphorylation of tubulins .
our previous study demonstrated that green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ transiently _PROTEIN_ in nicotiana benthamiana leaves localizes to cortical microtubules . to demonstrate the functional relevance of _PROTEIN_ to microtubule function we analyzed the subcellular localization and dynamics of _PROTEIN_ in live cells of a. thaliana . for this experiment _METHOD_ was fused to the c terminus of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ under the control of the native _PROTEIN_ promoter in the _PROTEIN_ mutant background . we used the mutant allele _PROTEIN_ in which _PROTEIN_ mrna is absent . the _PROTEIN_ mutants exhibited ectopic outgrowth of epidermal cells in the hypocotyls and petioles while the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ lines in the _PROTEIN_ background had no ectopic outgrowth or protrusions . this result indicated that _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ was functional . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ localized to filamentous structures and concentrated in particles along the filaments . we investigated the pattern of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ localization by double _METHOD_ microscopy using antibodies against tubulin and _METHOD_ . as shown in figure _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ localized to cortical microtubules . to confirm the association of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ with microtubules we treated _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ lines with the microtubule depolymerizing drug oryzalin and the microtubule stabilizing drug taxol . in the presence of oryzalin _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signal was dispersed throughout the _LOCATION_ whereas the addition of taxol stabilized the association of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ with cortical microtubules . the localization pattern of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was almost identical to that of transiently _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in our previous study . these results demonstrated that _PROTEIN_ associates with cortical microtubules . time lapse imaging with spinning disk confocal microscopy revealed the dynamic behavior of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ particles on the microtubules . when one moving particle labeled with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ encountered another these particles collided and were repulsed from each other . some particles collided and fused with each other and then divided into small size particles . the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signals were sometimes concentrated at the ends of filaments labeled with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ which exhibited growth and shrinkage . when the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ particle encountered another pre existing microtubule labeled by _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ this _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ particle was repulsed . during cytokinesis _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ localized to phragmoplasts and mitotic spindles . from these results _PROTEIN_ predominantly associates with microtubules and the particles labeled with _PROTEIN_ exhibit dynamic movement along microtubules . to determine whether _PROTEIN_ directly binds to microtubules we performed an in vitro microtubule co sedimentation assay . taxol stabilized microtubules were incubated with or without the full length _PROTEIN_ fused at the n terminus with glutathione s transferase _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and proteins were pelleted by centrifugation . when _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was incubated and centrifuged in the absence of microtubules _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ existed in the supernatant . when _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was incubated with microtubules _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was recovered in the pellet . this result indicates the direct interaction of _PROTEIN_ with microtubules . to investigate the _PROTEIN_ pattern of _PROTEIN_ protein during development _PROTEIN_ was fused to the c terminus of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ under the native _PROTEIN_ promoter in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ gus construct restored the wild type phenotype to the _PROTEIN_ mutant indicating that the _PROTEIN_ gus fusion protein was functional . _PROTEIN_ gus was preferentially accumulated in dividing or expanding cells of embryos and seedlings . in addition _PROTEIN_ gus was accumulated in the root apical meristem _PROTEIN_ root meristem shoot apical meristem leaf primordia and vascular tissue . during reproductive development _PROTEIN_ gus was preferentially _PROTEIN_ in inflorescent _METHOD_ flower buds and carpels . these _PROTEIN_ patterns suggested that _PROTEIN_ is involved in cellular division and expansion during the development of various organs and tissues . to investigate the possible involvement of _PROTEIN_ in microtubule function we monitored the organization of cortical microtubules in the wild type and _PROTEIN_ mutant by using _METHOD_ tagged tubulin _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . we used seedlings grown in the long day condition or in continuous light because the ectopic protrusions are formed in these conditions but suppressed in the dark condition . in the wild type epidermal cells cortical microtubules are arranged in a homogeneous array perpendicular or slightly oblique to the longitudinal axis of cells . in the epidermal cells of the _PROTEIN_ mutant before ectopic outgrowth cortical microtubules were arranged more randomly and irregularly than those of the wild type . at the first stage of outgrowth cortical microtubules appeared to curve around the outgrowth point . during ectopic outgrowth in the epidermal cells cortical microtubule arrays became more irregular and gradually exhibited a whirled pattern in the early outgrowth point . finally cortical microtubules oriented perpendicular to the growth axis of ectopic protuberance in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . figure illustrates the stages of ectopic outgrowth in figure . this result suggested that _PROTEIN_ is involved in the organization of cortical microtubule arrays . our previous _METHOD_ analysis could not detect cortical microtubule defects in _PROTEIN_ mutants . this might be due to technical _METHOD_ . in our previous analysis it was difficult to stain cortical microtubules of hypocotyl epidermal cells and cortical microtubules were detected in a relatively small number of hypocotyl cells . therefore this might make it difficult to investigate microtubules specifically focusing on morphologically affected cells in hypocotyls . the previous _METHOD_ analysis only allowed limited cells to be studied whereas our current study makes it possible to study more cells at different stages of protrusion formation . to address the role of _PROTEIN_ in microtubule organization changes in microtubule dynamics in the _PROTEIN_ mutant were analyzed . first we analyzed the effect of a microtubule depolymerizing drug oryzalin on cortical microtubules in the hypocotyl epidermal cells . in the wild type the majority of the cortical microtubules were depolymerized after treatment with oryzalin at for min . in contrast to this cortical microtubules in the _PROTEIN_ mutant were resistant to the same treatment with oryzalin . in both the wild type and _PROTEIN_ mutant treatment with oryzalin for min was sufficient to depolymerize all cortical microtubules . this result suggests increased stability of cortical microtubules in the hypocotyl epidermal cells of the _PROTEIN_ mutant . next we analyzed microtubule dynamics in the wild type and _PROTEIN_ mutant . the dynamics of the plus end of individual cortical microtubules was monitored in the epidermal cells of hypocotyls by using _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . table shows the velocities of growth and shrinkage frequency of catastrophe and rescue the microtubule dynamics and the percentages of time that microtubules spent in periods of growth shrinkage and pause . most parameters of microtubule dynamics were not significantly different between the wild type and _PROTEIN_ mutant whereas the time spent in the pause state in _PROTEIN_ was significantly increased than that in the wild type . the plus ends of microtubules in _PROTEIN_ tended to spend more time in pause than did those of the wild type . these results indicate that microtubules were stabilized in the epidermal cells of the _PROTEIN_ mutant . to further investigate the involvement of _PROTEIN_ in microtubule regulation we analyzed the effects of the microtubule depolymerizing drug propyzamide and the microtubule stabilizing drug taxol on ectopic outgrowth in _PROTEIN_ mutants . propyzamide induced protrusions in hypocotyl epidermal cells in the wild type at a low frequency as described by citation . interestingly propyzamide significantly suppressed the formation of protuberances by the hypocotyl epidermal cells in _PROTEIN_ mutants . on the contrary the addition of taxol strongly enhanced protuberance formation in _PROTEIN_ mutants . these results suggest that microtubule stabilization is involved in the _PROTEIN_ ectopic outgrowth phenotype . in a previous study the _PROTEIN_ phenotype was slightly enhanced but not suppressed by propyzamide . here we find the suppression by propyzamide of the _PROTEIN_ phenotype . this discrepancy might be due to differences in the growth conditions including the growth media and light conditions . seedlings were grown on okada and shimura medium in citation while seedlings are grown on the modified half strength murashige and skoog _METHOD_ medium in this study . because our previous study indicates that the _PROTEIN_ phenotype is enhanced by ethylene but is suppressed by gibberellin and etiolation growth condition and endogenous hormone levels may affect the _PROTEIN_ phenotype and effects of microtubule inhibitors . because of the association of _PROTEIN_ with microtubules and irregular cortical microtubules in _PROTEIN_ we hypothesized that _PROTEIN_ might phosphorylate maps and/or microtubules _METHOD_ . to examine this possibility protein fractions that contained maps and microtubules were purified from arabidopsis suspension cells and fractionated on an anion exchange column . each fraction was then subjected to an in vitro kinase assay with or without the recombinant _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ protein . phosphorylation of a protein band was significantly enhanced with the addition of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . this protein band was analyzed by _PROTEIN_ assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ analysis which showed that the protein band was a mixture of tubulin and tubulin . to examine whether _PROTEIN_ could phosphorylate tubulin we incubated purified arabidopsis tubulin with or without _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in the presence of _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ significantly phosphorylated purified tubulin . next we incubated recombinant his tagged tubulin _PROTEIN_ or tubulin _PROTEIN_ with or without _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in the presence of _PROTEIN_ both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were strongly phosphorylated by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . the phosphorylated _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were completely dephosphorylated by the incubation with protein phosphatase and the dephosphorylation by was overcome by the addition of phosphatase inhibitors . these results demonstrated that tubulin is a bona fide _PROTEIN_ substrate . to identify proteins that interact with _PROTEIN_ a yeast two hybrid screen was conducted using full length _PROTEIN_ as the bait . three nek genes including _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were repeatedly isolated from positive colonies . fragments of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ cdna were recovered from the yeast and found to be truncated at the end . these cdnas encoded c terminal regions that contained coiled coil domains . these proteins bound to _PROTEIN_ and induced the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ c reporter genes in yeast cells suggesting that _PROTEIN_ interacts with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and itself through their c terminal regions . next we analyzed the interaction of _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and itself in a yeast two hybrid assay . the _PROTEIN_ construct was used as bait and transformed into yeast cells together with the prey vectors . as shown in figure _PROTEIN_ interacted with _PROTEIN_ and itself but not with _PROTEIN_ . to confirm the interaction of _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in plant cells the _PROTEIN_ c terminal tail immediately following the kinase domain was fused with _METHOD_ at the n terminus _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and co _PROTEIN_ with hemagglutinin tagged c terminal tail immediately following the kinase domain of _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in the leaves of nicotiana benthamiana . the protein complex containing _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was immunoprecipitated using anti _METHOD_ antibody . both ha _PROTEIN_ and ha _PROTEIN_ were co immunoprecipitated with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ indicating the interaction of _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in planta . it has been previously shown that the _PROTEIN_ mutation in which a conserved pro residue at amino acid position in the plant nek c terminal motif is substituted by thr induced ectopic outgrowth in epidermal cells a loss of function phenotype of _PROTEIN_ . because the c terminal region is required for the dimerization of neks we investigated the effect of the _PROTEIN_ mutation _PROTEIN_ on the interaction of _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in a yeast two hybrid assay . the _PROTEIN_ mutation was introduced into the _PROTEIN_ construct used as the bait and transformed into yeast cells together with the prey vectors . as shown in figure the _PROTEIN_ mutation markedly reduced the interaction between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ whereas _PROTEIN_ increased the interaction of _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ in yeast cells . however the dimerization of _PROTEIN_ was not affected by the _PROTEIN_ mutation . these results suggest that the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ interaction might be required for _PROTEIN_ function and the _PROTEIN_ mutation could alter the affinity of _PROTEIN_ for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . to address the subcellular localization of neks nek proteins tagged with _METHOD_ at the n terminus were transiently _PROTEIN_ in the leaves of n. benthamiana under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus promoter . _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ localized to microtubules in a similar manner as _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . in contrast _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ accumulated in the cytoplasm . co _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ nek proteins with _PROTEIN_ tagged with red _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ at the n terminus _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ demonstrated that all of the _METHOD_ neks co localized with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in a punctate filamentous pattern . interestingly _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ exhibited a marked accumulation in punctate structures with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . these results implied that _PROTEIN_ co localizes with other nek members and regulates the localization of _PROTEIN_ . based on the co localization and interaction of _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ might function with _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in the regulation of cell expansion and morphogenesis . to test the genetic interaction of _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ we analyzed phenotypes of t dna insertion mutants of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and their double mutants with _PROTEIN_ . we identified _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants in salk t dna insertion lines and generated the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutants . the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants did not _PROTEIN_ mrna for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ respectively . these single mutants had no obvious morphological phenotype . the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutants exhibited fewer protuberances in epidermal cells of hypocotyls and petioles than the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ single mutants respectively . in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant fewer protuberances were formed in epidermal cells than in the _PROTEIN_ single mutant . the suppressive effect of _PROTEIN_ on the _PROTEIN_ phenotype was slightly weaker than that of _PROTEIN_ . on the other hand the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutants were almost identical to the _PROTEIN_ single mutant . we could not isolate _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutants for some unknown reason . these results suggested that ectopic outgrowth in _PROTEIN_ is dependent on _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ .

from the arabidopsis biological resouce center _PROTEIN_ . the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ line was crossed with the _PROTEIN_ mutants . seedlings were grown at on a modified murashige and skoog _METHOD_ medium _METHOD_ or on the soil either in constant white light or in a h h dark cycle of white light . taxol oryzalin and propyzamide were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide _METHOD_ and adjusted so that the final concentration of _METHOD_ in each medium was < . the _PROTEIN_ genomic region including a bp region upstream of the initiation codon and the _PROTEIN_ coding region without the stop codon was amplified from columbia genomic dna by pcr using the primers _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and subcloned into pentr d topo . this entry vector was used in the gateway lr reaction with the gateway binary vectors and to generate _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ gus and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ constructs respectively . the full length _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were amplified by rt pcr from total rna of columbia using the primer pairs described in table and cloned into pentr d topo . these entry vectors were used in the lr reaction with the gateway binary vector to generate _METHOD_ nek constructs . the full length _PROTEIN_ was also transferred from pentr into the gateway binary vector for a _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ construct . to generate an entry clone containing the _PROTEIN_ c terminal region the sequence encoding the n terminal kinase domain of _PROTEIN_ was deleted from pentr _PROTEIN_ using a kod mutagenesis kit with the primers _PROTEIN_ and entr r . the pentr _PROTEIN_ c terminal region and pentr _PROTEIN_ c terminal region were created by the same method using the primers _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ respectively . the sequence of the c terminal region of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ was transferred from pentr to the gateway binary vector in order to generate ha _PROTEIN_ and ha _PROTEIN_ constructs respectively . the sequence of the c terminal region of _PROTEIN_ was transferred from pentr to the gateway binary vector to generate the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ construct . these binary vectors were introduced into the agrobacterium
