the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ gene encodes a serine _PROTEIN_ ii like protein . its biological role in the brassinosteroid signaling pathway was first established by its capability to specifically suppress a weak brassinosteroid insensitive _PROTEIN_ allele _PROTEIN_ when overexpressed . to gain additional insights into the molecular _METHOD_ of _PROTEIN_ function the subcellular localization and the biochemical characteristics of _PROTEIN_ were determined by using transgenic plants harboring a _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ construct and fusion proteins purified from _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ transgenic plants . the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein was _PROTEIN_ secreted and accumulated in the _LOCATION_ space . immunological data suggest that _PROTEIN_ is proteolytically processed by an unknown endoproteinase in planta . affinity purified _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ from transgenic plants show strong hydrolytic activity with a broad substrate preference including basic and hydrophobic groups on either side of the scissile bond . the hydrolytic activity of _PROTEIN_ can be strongly inhibited by a serine protease inhibitor phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride . the ph and temperature optima for the hydrolytic activity of _PROTEIN_ are ph and respectively . these data demonstrate that _PROTEIN_ is a secreted and active serine _PROTEIN_ consistent with the hypothesis suggested by our previous genetic evidence that _PROTEIN_ may process a protein involved in an early event in the _PROTEIN_ signaling pathway .
_PROTEIN_ exhibits a broad _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is a dominant _PROTEIN_ suppressor identified by our previous activation tagging genetic screen . overexpression of _PROTEIN_ can specifically suppress _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ domain mutants instead of an intracellular kinase dead mutant suggesting that _PROTEIN_ may play a role in the early events of the br signaling pathway . because _PROTEIN_ the gene encoding the br receptor is _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in young tissues but less abundantly in mature tissues we predict that _PROTEIN_ may have a similar or overlapping _PROTEIN_ pattern . rt pcr analyses indicated that _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ in almost all of the tissues tested . unlike _PROTEIN_ however _PROTEIN_ can only be detected at lower levels in roots and _METHOD_ . consistently transgenic plants harboring _PROTEIN_ gus show that _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in young tissues such as cotyledons young leaves unopened flowers and _METHOD_ . these results clearly indicate that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ have overlapping _PROTEIN_ domains . interestingly we observed that most of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ lines show fold the height of the _PROTEIN_ plants whereas _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plants are only about two times the height of _PROTEIN_ . to test whether the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ level is the cause of the plant height difference total rna was extracted from primary inflorescence _METHOD_ of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and one representative line of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and rt pcr analysis was conducted . as expected the more the _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ the taller the transgenic plants grow . these results are consistent with the idea that the reduced br perception caused by the point mutation in _PROTEIN_ can be partially restored by the overexpression of _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ is localized to the exterior of the was suggested from our previous genetic data that _PROTEIN_ may be involved in an early step in br signaling . because the br perception occurs _LOCATION_ we predict that _PROTEIN_ should be a secreted protein . sequence analysis indicated that _PROTEIN_ contains a typical n terminal signal peptide but failed to identify any _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ or _LOCATION_ retention signals implying that _PROTEIN_ may be secreted from cells . to confirm this hypothesis we generated transgenic _PROTEIN_ plants harboring a _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein . these transgenic plants exhibit the _PROTEIN_ suppression phenotype similar to that of the original _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ suppressor and the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ transgenic plants suggesting that the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein is functionally equivalent to _PROTEIN_ in planta . therefore the localization revealed by _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ should represent that of native _PROTEIN_ . using a _METHOD_ antibody to analyze the total protein extracts from the transgenic plants several specific bands were detected . among them an kda band may represent the intact _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein and a kda band may represent the c terminal _PROTEIN_ fragment attached to _METHOD_ after a predicted processing step . other smaller bands seen in the western assay may result from partial digestion of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . further confirmation of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ processing will be discussed in the latter part of this section . root tips from day old _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ seedlings were prepared for confocal microscopy assay . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ plants from similar developmental stages were used as negative and positive controls respectively . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ another crucial component in br signal transduction pathway was demonstrated to be a _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ protein . without any treatment the localization of the green _METHOD_ signals for both _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ are indistinguishable as both are apparently localized on the cell surface after plasmolysis was induced with m mannitol the green _METHOD_ signal of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ moved with the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ indicating its _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ localization . the majority of the green _METHOD_ signal of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ however stayed in the cell wall and only part of the green _METHOD_ signal moved with the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . these observations suggest that _PROTEIN_ protein is _PROTEIN_ secreted and that some of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein may associate with yet unknown _LOCATION_ proteins . _PROTEIN_ is a further confirm that _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ a secreted protein and may be partially associated with _LOCATION_ proteins as seen in the confocal microscopy results the distribution of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ protein in different protein fractions was investigated . different protein fractions were isolated from _PROTEIN_ and homozygous _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ seedlings . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is biologically functional in planta because _PROTEIN_ plants harboring _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ show a similar suppression phenotype as that of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . equal amounts of protein samples from different protein fractions were immunoprecipitated with anti _PROTEIN_ agarose affinity gel overnight at and eluted in _PROTEIN_ sample buffer . the eluted protein samples were run on _PROTEIN_ polyacrylamide gel and analyzed by western analysis . consistent with the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ western results showed that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ can be detected in both total crude and soluble protein fractions and that a small amount of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ can be detected in the _LOCATION_ protein fraction as well . interestingly there are two specific _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ bands revealed on the _PROTEIN_ polyacrylamide gel . the peptide _METHOD_ fingerprinting analysis by maldi tof _METHOD_ _METHOD_ demonstrated that both bands are _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ with the difference in migration possibly due to different post translational modifications . to investigate whether the upper band resulted from glycosylation or phosphorylation the soluble protein was affinity purified and used for endoglycosidase h and ciap treatments . endoglycosidase h removes asparagine linked glycosyl chains and ciap removes phosphate . compared with untreated _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ samples only the endoglycosidase h treatment can cause the band shift of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ suggesting that _PROTEIN_ is an n glycosylated protein but not a phosphorylated protein . after treatment however the double bands could still be detected . the double bands were likely the result of insufficient signal peptide removal by the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ localized peptidase . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is proteolytically processed in plant serine _PROTEIN_ need to be cleaved into a and b chains for activity . for example barley _PROTEIN_ i is cleaved into two polypeptide chains for a heterodimer linked by disulfides important for catalytic activity . the linker peptide containing residues is endoproteolytically excised . there is one predicted cleavage linker in the _PROTEIN_ protein sequence . a western assay suggested that _PROTEIN_ may be processed in vivo . to further confirm the in vivo processing of _PROTEIN_ large scale protein preparation and affinity purification were performed . based on the immunological results of different protein fractions total protein including soluble and _LOCATION_ fractions was used for affinity purification . homozygous _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ transgenic plants were used as a control . to ensure the quality of the affinity purification procedure nontransgenic _PROTEIN_ plants were included as a negative control . in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ one of the catalytic triad his was mutated to ala. overexpression of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ failed to suppress _PROTEIN_ defective phenotypes which implies that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is not biologically functional in planta . both _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ can be effectively purified from the transgenic plants . typically of purified _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ can be recovered from g of week old seedlings . if _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is cleaved as predicted we expect to see two bands at kda and kda respectively . in fig . the left section shows the _METHOD_ blue stained high percentage _PROTEIN_ polyacrylamide gel . about ng of purified protein was loaded for each sample . in the lane for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ besides the intact _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ protein band there were two extra specific bands at kda and kda . the right section of fig . shows the western analysis results with anti _PROTEIN_ monoclonal antibody . only the kda band can be detected by the anti _PROTEIN_ antibody because _PROTEIN_ epitope was tagged only at the _PROTEIN_ terminus of _PROTEIN_ . the molecular _METHOD_ of these two bands are a little bit larger than predicted possibly due to glycosylation . trypsin digestion of the kda band shows that it is the n terminal peptide of _PROTEIN_ . five tryptic peptides _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were revealed using nano electrospray quadrupole time of flight _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . _PROTEIN_ protein is possibly cleaved within the first amino acids to remove the signal peptide based on the peptide _METHOD_ fingerprinting . fig . shows the _METHOD_ spectrum of one of the tryptic peptides _PROTEIN_ in protein . because all the detected peptides are within the predicted a chain from we conclude that _PROTEIN_ is proteolytically processed to form a and b chains for activity similar to that of wheat _PROTEIN_ ii barley _PROTEIN_ i and an arabidopsis ser cp like protein sinapoylglucose choline sinapoyltransferase . to further demonstrate that _PROTEIN_ is processed in planta and was not cleaved by a contaminated endoprotease during a long affinity purification procedure seedlings were quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen and total proteins were extracted with _PROTEIN_ sample buffer in which all the proteins should be denatured . a western blot analysis using this protein sample indicated that _PROTEIN_ was indeed cleaved to two chains in planta . the resulted a and b chains are apparently attached by disulfide bonds because elimination of mercaptol ethanol in the extraction buffer greatly reduced the b chain signal . to test whether _PROTEIN_ is processed by itself the immunopurified _PROTEIN_ protein was incubated in a proteinase buffer with triton x used for _PROTEIN_ ser cp activity analysis . if _PROTEIN_ can process itself we would expect to see the full length _PROTEIN_ signal being gradually reduced whereas on the other hand the signal of the processed product the b chain signal would be gradually increased . half of the samples were treated with serine protease inhibitor _METHOD_ . the _PROTEIN_ that the full length _PROTEIN_ signal and processed b chain signal remained unchanged during the incubation time period and that they showed no difference even with _METHOD_ treated samples clearly indicated that _PROTEIN_ can not cleave itself . _PROTEIN_ is therefore processed by an in vivo unidentified protease . interestingly _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ can not be efficiently cleaved into a and b chains like its native counterpart . it is possible that the point mutation in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ may have changed the _PROTEIN_ structure of _PROTEIN_ which becomes inaccessible to the unknown endopeptidase responsible for the cleavage . _PROTEIN_ is an active serine _PROTEIN_ test whether _PROTEIN_ is an active serine _PROTEIN_ and whether it has substrate preference various dipeptides conjugated to the chromophore including a basic or a hydrophobic amino acid on either side of the scissile bonds were used for enzyme activity assay . the enzyme activity was monitored by an absorbance _PROTEIN_ at nm . fig . shows a time course of enzyme activity of the purified _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ protein toward the substrate fa arg leu . almost no hydrolysis of fa arg leu by affinity purified protein from _PROTEIN_ brs _PROTEIN_ was detected on the contrary purified protein from _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ consistently catalyzed the hydrolysis of fa arg leu . when _METHOD_ an irreversible inhibitor of enzymes with active serine residue was added to the purified protein and incubated on ice for h the hydrolytic activity of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was inhibited by > . in contrast leupeptin a reversible serine and cysteine protease inhibitor can only inhibit the _PROTEIN_ hydrolytic activity by . these data prove that _PROTEIN_ is an active serine _PROTEIN_ with hydrolytic activity . _PROTEIN_ protein has broad substrate the substrates tested _PROTEIN_ can cleave basic and hydrophobic residues from the c terminus of the peptides and fa arg leu is the optimal substrate . _PROTEIN_ can not cleave acidic residues similar to all other known ser cps that do not remove acidic residues from the _PROTEIN_ terminus of the peptides . effect of ph and temperature on the _PROTEIN_ hydrolytic obtain additional information about _PROTEIN_ biochemical characteristics the effects of ph and temperature on the _PROTEIN_ hydrolytic reaction were analyzed . appears to be the optimal ph for _PROTEIN_ hydrolytic activity . this result is consistent with other known ser cps that have acidic optimum ph for activity toward peptide substrates . the optimal reaction temperature is which suggests that _PROTEIN_ is a heat stable enzyme similar to the ser cp like protein sinapoylglucose choline sinapoyltransferase which was also heat stable .
