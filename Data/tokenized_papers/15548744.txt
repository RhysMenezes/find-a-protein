in arabidopsis thaliana brassinosteroid perception is mediated by two leu rich repeat receptor like kinases brassinosteroid _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ associated receptor _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . genetic biochemical and yeast interaction studies suggested that the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ receptor complex initiates br signaling but the role of the _PROTEIN_ receptor is still not clear . using transient _PROTEIN_ in protoplasts of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ fused to cyan and yellow _METHOD_ green _METHOD_ protein variants allowed us to localize each receptor independently in vivo . we show that _PROTEIN_ but not _PROTEIN_ homodimerizes in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ whereas _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ preferentially heterodimerize in the endosomes . coexpression of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ results in a change of the steady state distribution of both receptors because of accelerated endocytosis . endocytic vesicles contain either _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ alone or both . we propose that the _PROTEIN_ protein is involved in changing the equilibrium between _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ located _PROTEIN_ homodimers and endocytosed _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ heterodimers .
to determine the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ proteins in plant cells we performed in vivo targeting experiments in cowpea and arabidopsis protoplasts derived from leaf tissue . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ proteins were tagged at the c terminus with either _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ and then transiently _PROTEIN_ in protoplasts under control of the constitutive promoter of cauliflower mosaic virus . the localization of each fusion protein was examined using confocal laser scanning microscopy _PROTEIN_ . to show the morphology of the protoplast and the localization of the _METHOD_ proteins for each confocal optical section of a cell _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ _METHOD_ is presented in a separate channel followed by the chlorophyll _METHOD_ in the red channel and by an overlay image combining both . the transient protein _PROTEIN_ system in protoplasts has been successfully used to study gene regulation signal transduction protein targeting and trafficking in plant cells . in spite of many advantages protoplasts also have limitations . first localization of the transiently _PROTEIN_ proteins may not always reflect that of the endogenous proteins in intact plant cells because of overexpression . second protoplasts are devoid of cell walls and plasmodesmata and lack normal cell cell communication and _PROTEIN_ cues so the transiently _PROTEIN_ proteins may behave differently from the endogenous proteins in intact plant cells . thus the results obtained using transient _PROTEIN_ in protoplasts should be considered with those limitations in _PROTEIN_ . in single transfections _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion proteins are localized to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ as early as h after transfection and this pattern was unchanged up to h incubation of the protoplasts . in figures to representative images are shown after h of incubation . residual _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was also seen in the cytoplasm similar to what was observed for _PROTEIN_ the previously described close homolog of _PROTEIN_ . when protoplasts were optically cross sectioned close to the periphery of the cell multiple _METHOD_ labeled vesicle like compartments were observed _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . often those organelles appeared to be at a site near the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide was added to protoplasts _PROTEIN_ either _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ h after transfection and the protoplasts were examined up to h after the treatment . in chx treated protoplasts no change in the distribution of either _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ between the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and the vesicle like compartments was seen when compared with untreated protoplasts or to protoplasts _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ overnight . in general the _PROTEIN_ was higher when the longer incubation time was used . the constant level of _LOCATION_ localized receptors in the absence of protein synthesis suggests that neither undergoes rapid internalization when _PROTEIN_ alone . when _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were coexpressed for h as _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ fusions respectively followed by h of chx treatment there was almost compete depletion of both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ proteins from the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . this suggested that the presence of _PROTEIN_ altered the _LOCATION_ location of _PROTEIN_ . this could be because of accelerated endocytosis and/or inefficient recycling back to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . an interesting observation in the _PROTEIN_ coexpression experiments was the lack of complete colocalization between the two _METHOD_ tagged proteins in the endosomes . surprisingly we distinguished three different types of vesicle like compartments compartments that contained _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ together and compartments that contained either _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ alone . the ratio between the numbers of each type of compartment differed among different protoplasts . similar observations were made when arabidopsis protoplasts were cotransfected with _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ proteins . because an endocytic compartment will contain more than a single molecule of the _METHOD_ labeled receptor this excludes the possibility of a random event . thus we conclude that the endosomal sorting mechanism in plant cells can distinguish among different _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ receptors . to verify that the vesicular origin of the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ proteins is the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and does not represent proteins in transit from the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ we used rat sialyltransferase fused to _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ as a _LOCATION_ marker for colocalization experiments with either _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ tagged proteins . it was previously shown that the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ localizes to the trans side of the _LOCATION_ compartments in tobacco cells cowpea protoplasts and in arabidopsis . no colocalization between _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and either _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was observed . in arabidopsis roots brefeldin a inhibits post _LOCATION_ vesicle trafficking by targeting large arf gefs resulting in rapid internalization of _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ proteins in so called bfa compartments containing fused endosomes . bfa added to the cowpea protoplasts coexpressing _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and either _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ destroyed the integrity of the _LOCATION_ vesicles and causing accumulation of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ on the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ as early as min after application . similar effects of bfa in cowpea protoplasts were previously observed using the _LOCATION_ marker _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ . no change in the morphology and localization of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ labeled vesicles was observed after bfa application . this suggested that in cowpea protoplasts derived from a mesophyll tissue the internalization and recycling of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ proteins are bfa insensitive . to confirm the endosomal localization of the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ proteins we examined the localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion proteins simultaneously with the lipophilic dye . is routinely used to follow the endocytic pathway in yeast and in plant cells . as indicated by arrowheads in figures and most of the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ containing vesicles are stained with suggesting that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ proteins are indeed recycled and internalized via an endocytic mechanism . to determine where _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ receptor homodimerization or heterodimerization occurs in cells we applied flim . this technique captures fret occurring between the _METHOD_ donor and the _METHOD_ acceptor molecules when both are in close proximity of nm . this distance is _PROTEIN_ to be indicative of direct protein protein interaction . using a combination of a two photon laser scanning microscope and a time correlated single photon counting acquisition card a _METHOD_ intensity image of the tagged receptors is obtained . subsequently the _METHOD_ lifetime of the _METHOD_ donor molecule is calculated for every pixel in the image according to a double exponential decay model . upon fret the of the _METHOD_ donor molecules will _PROTEIN_ and is visualized as a false color coded image superimposed over the visible light image . the mean _METHOD_ lifetime ranges from dark blue to dark orange or red . flim measurements performed with all receptor combinations used in this analysis are summarized in table . _METHOD_ lifetime analysis and fret characterization in cowpea protoplasts we first investigated whether _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were able fto form homodimers . in protoplasts _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ constructs the lifetime of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ remained ns _LOCATION_ . occasionally single small areas showing lifetime reduction in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ were found in a few of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ protoplasts . by contrast in _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ protoplasts a reduction in the _METHOD_ lifetime of the donor _METHOD_ molecules was detected suggesting that _PROTEIN_ was able to form homodimers in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . the reduction in the _METHOD_ lifetime of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in the presence of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was comparable to the reduction of the _METHOD_ lifetime of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in the presence of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ which was previously shown to form homodimers in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . the areas where _PROTEIN_ homodimers in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ occur do not appear to be organized but are fairly frequent . we conclude that the _PROTEIN_ receptor exists as a homodimer in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ of living plant cells . we can not exclude the possibility that in some cases the lack of fret is because of a competitive interaction between endogenous and transiently _PROTEIN_ br receptors . this depends on the abundance of the endogenous receptors in the respective tissues . although the _PROTEIN_ receptor is _PROTEIN_ relatively high in mesophyll cells fret was always observed between transiently coexpressed _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ receptors . the abundance of _PROTEIN_ transcripts in mesophyll cells was low as predicted by rt pcr suggesting that the lack of interaction between transiently coexpressed _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ receptors is unlikely to be caused by interaction with its native counterpart and most likely reflects the monomeric state of _PROTEIN_ . to determine whether _PROTEIN_ heterodimerization occurred in vivo we transfected protoplasts with either _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ constructs . because the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ of the cells cotransfected with _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ is rapidly depleted of the receptors we first analyzed those parts where the _METHOD_ proteins were still present . in such areas the _METHOD_ intensity image of a protoplast cotransfected with for example _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ showed a uniform distribution of the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . in most parts of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ no or very little reduction in the _METHOD_ lifetime was observed . those values corresponded to the values of the _METHOD_ lifetimes determined for protoplasts transfected with either _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ constructs alone and indicated no interaction occurring between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in those areas . in addition multiple small patches that showed a significant reduction in from to ns of the donor _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ molecules were observed . the fret efficiency in these areas was . the size and the frequency of these discrete areas varied among different protoplasts . we next determined the lifetime of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ donor molecules in the presence of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in the endocytic compartments at a site near the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ or located in the cytoplasm . twin like organelles next to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ showed a reduction in of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ from to ns . comparable reductions in the _METHOD_ lifetime of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were observed in most of the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ containing endocytic compartments located in the cytoplasm _METHOD_ . we conclude that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ heterodimerization is nonuniformly distributed in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and appears to coincide with developing endocytic compartments that contain both receptors . to determine if brassinolide treatment of the cowpea protoplasts coexpressing _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ tagged proteins would alter the amount or the size of the _LOCATION_ areas in which fret occurred we performed flim experiments on protoplasts coexpressing _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in the presence of bl . no changes in the values of the _METHOD_ donor molecules or in the number and distribution of the _LOCATION_ areas showing fret were observed . because bl has been shown to specifically bind to _PROTEIN_ and increase _PROTEIN_ phosphorylation one possibility could be that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ show ligand independent endocytosis . alternatively the protoplasts could contain sufficient endogenous amounts of bl to activate the introduced _METHOD_ receptors . to determine whether our flim data represent elements of an activated br signaling pathway we made use of the _PROTEIN_ protein one of the two proposed _LOCATION_ targets of br signaling . unphosphorylated _PROTEIN_ protein was reported to accumulate in the _LOCATION_ in response to bl and to promote cell elongation in dark grown arabidopsis hypocotyls . we transiently _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein in protoplasts and examined the cells before and after bl application . the _METHOD_ fusion with the gain of function mutant _PROTEIN_ d which was previously shown to accumulate in the _LOCATION_ without bl application was used as a positive control . in cowpea protoplasts both the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and the mutant _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusions were observed in the _LOCATION_ as early as h after transfection . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ proteins were also seen in the cytoplasm and in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . overnight _PROTEIN_ of either _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or mutant _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ proteins induced cell elongation and eventually the rupture of the protoplasts indicating the presence of functional _PROTEIN_ proteins in the protoplast system . application of bl had no effect on the localization of either _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ d _METHOD_ proteins . we used arabidopsis protoplasts isolated from mutants defective in the biosynthesis of brs such as _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ to transiently _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein . in all mutant backgrounds _PROTEIN_ protein was localized in the _LOCATION_ without bl treatment . we conclude that contrary to the previous observation made by citation in mesophyll cells _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ localization is not dependent on the br application . similar observations were reported previously when the _LOCATION_ localization of _PROTEIN_ was examined in light grown root tips . we next checked the phosphorylation state of _PROTEIN_ protein without and with bl treatment in arabidopsis protoplasts . in the absence of ligand _PROTEIN_ was found in phosphorylated form after bl treatment was shifted into a dephosphorylated form of faster electrophoretic mobility . it was proposed that the dephosphorylated form of _PROTEIN_ modulates the transcription of bl regulated genes . as shown in figure _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was detected as a fast and a slow migrating band after _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and immunoblotting with anti _PROTEIN_ antibody or anti _METHOD_ antibody representing phosphorylated and unphosphorylated _METHOD_ . the presence of the two _METHOD_ in our system was not dependent on bl application . based on the presence of unphosphorylated _PROTEIN_ protein in the _LOCATION_ we conclude that in protoplasts the br signaling is active . therefore our observations concerning _PROTEIN_ endocytosis appear to represent active br signaling . rna gel blot experiments and real time quantitative rt pcr have shown that in arabidopsis the _PROTEIN_ gene is _PROTEIN_ ubiquitously and displays very little organ specificity . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was observed in cells of the hypocotyls roots and cotyledons of seedlings stably _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein from the _PROTEIN_ promoter . although not organ specific _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was temporally regulated and adult tissues always displayed low levels of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . in previous studies _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was reported to be exclusively _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ localized . based on our observation that in protoplasts coexpression of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ resulted in accelerated endocytosis of the complex we further explored the possibility that a similar phenomenon could be observed in planta . we therefore introduced the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion under the control of the _PROTEIN_ endogenous promoter in wild type arabidopsis plants . the same construct was shown to rescue the _PROTEIN_ mutation . two independent lines containing a single copy of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ construct were selected and analyzed further . using _PROTEIN_ we looked at whether _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was internalized in roots of d old light grown seedlings . as previously described _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was detected on the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ in roots but surprisingly also in endocytic compartments . this occurred first at the apical part of the root meristem immediately adjacent to the quiescent center and to a lesser extent in the _PROTEIN_ and the columella root cap cells and in the elongation zone . in the mature parts of the root _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was reduced but also seen in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and in the endosomes . this observation supports the hypothesis that the increased rate of _PROTEIN_ endocytosis is correlated with the places where active br signaling is occurring in roots . staining was used to colabel the vesicles _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . as shown in figures to colocalizes with most of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ containing vesicles . we next analyzed the effect of bfa on _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ endocytosis in arabidopsis roots . bfa application in the presence of chx caused reversible aggregation of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ in compartments similar in morphology and localization to the bfa induced compartments of the pin formed _PROTEIN_ proteins . these results suggest that endosome mediated _PROTEIN_ internalization as observed in cowpea protoplasts also occurs in arabidopsis root cells . to show that the observed difference in bfa sensitivity between cowpea mesophyll cells and arabidopsis root cells is not an artifact of the cowpea protoplasts we generated protoplasts from to d old _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgenic seedlings . bfa application of the protoplasts caused formation of bfa bodies only in the chlorophyll free cells derived from either root or hypocotyl parts of the plant . we never observed formation of bfa compartments in the chlorophyll containing cells under the same conditions although some peripheral aggregation of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein was occasionally observed . this observation also suggests there are differences in the response of different plant cells to application of bfa . to determine whether the rate of _PROTEIN_ endocytosis in arabidopsis root cells is dependent on or reduced in the absence of the _PROTEIN_ protein the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgenic line was crossed to a _PROTEIN_ null mutant . no change in the rate of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ endocytosis in the _PROTEIN_ background compared with the wild type was observed . we conclude that the observed bfa sensitive trafficking of _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis roots reflects general recycling as was also observed for the _PROTEIN_ proteins .
arabidopsis thaliana ecotype columbia was used as the wild type . seeds were germinated either on half strength _METHOD_ medium plus sucrose or directly in soil . plants were grown under _METHOD_ light . arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ plants were generated by introducing the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ construct using the floral dip method . transgenic seedlings were selected on half strength _METHOD_ medium containing mg/l kanamycin . seven day old arabidopsis seedlings from two independent homozygous _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ lines were used to determine the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ localization in roots using _PROTEIN_ . a _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgenic line was crossed with a _PROTEIN_ null mutant generated by the salk institute . seeds from _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ arabidopsis mutants were obtained from the the arabidopsis stock center . the full length cdna of _PROTEIN_ was pcr amplified from an est obtained from kazusa dna research institute with primers _PROTEIN_ f catgccatggatgaagactttttcaagc and _PROTEIN_ r catgccatggctaattttccttcaggaa . the _PROTEIN_ cdna was then inserted in the ncoi site upstream of the _METHOD_ tags of the vectors to generate _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusions respectively . the _PROTEIN_ cdna was pcr amplified with primers f catgccatggaacgaagattaatgatc and r catgccatggctcttggacccgaggg and subcloned in the ncoi site of the vectors _METHOD_ . all constructs were verified by sequencing . the binary constructs _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ used for transient assays in protoplasts were the same as described by citation . the full length _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ fusions were described before . cowpea and arabidopsis mesophyll protoplasts were prepared and transfected as described previously by citation citation and citation . after transfection the protoplasts were incubated in protoplast medium either overnight or for h followed by addition of chx in concentration from mm stock . the protoplasts were used for observations until h after adding the chx . bfa was added to the protoplasts or applied to _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ arabidopsis seedlings in concentration from mg/ml in _METHOD_ . the protoplasts or the arabidopsis roots were observed with _PROTEIN_ in intervals of min after the bfa application . the bfa wash off experiments were performed as described by citation and epibrassinolide was applied to the protoplasts in concentration from mm stock in ethanol . the protoplasts were taken for observation or fret measurements after overnight or to h incubation with the epibrassinolide . staining of the protoplasts and the arabidopsis roots was performed exactly as described by citation . the protoplasts were washed from the dye and incubated in protoplast medium for and h. arabidopsis protoplasts transiently _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein for to h were used for immunoblotting analysis as previously described by citation using anti _PROTEIN_ antibody . the _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and the in protoplasts and in arabidopsis seedlings were analyzed with the confocal laser scanning microscope as described before by citation . in addition the _METHOD_ was excited by the nm laser line in combination with the _PROTEIN_ dichroic and _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was detected by a band pass to nm filter . a oil immersion objective was used for scanning . the pinhole setting was which yielded a theoretical _PROTEIN_ of . images and data captures were analyzed with zeiss _PROTEIN_ software . flim was performed using a bio rad radiance _PROTEIN_ system in combination with a nikon te inverted microscope . two photon excitation pulses were generated by a ti sapphire laser that was pumped by a w coherent verdi laser . pulse trains of mhz were produced . the excitation light was directly coupled into the microscope and focused into the sample using a _PROTEIN_ plan apochromat water immersion objective lens . _METHOD_ light was detected using the nondescanned single photon counting detection which is the most sensitive solution for two photon imaging . for the flim experiment the hamamatsu mcp pmt was used which has a typical time resolution ps . _METHOD_ emission was selected using a band pass filter . images with a frame size of pixels were acquired and the average count rate was photons/s for an acquisition time of s . from the intensity images obtained complete _METHOD_ lifetime decays were calculated per pixel and fitted using a double exponential decay model . the _METHOD_ lifetime of one component was fixed to the value found for _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . the fret efficiency was determined by e where is the _METHOD_ lifetime of the donor in the absence of acceptor and that of the donor in the presence of acceptor at a distance . the distance between the donor and the acceptor was determined from the relation where is the radius the distance between the donor and acceptor at which energy transfer takes place .
