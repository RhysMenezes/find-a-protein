cellulose _PROTEIN_ synthesizes cellulose necessary for seed mucilage adherence to seed coat epidermal cells of arabidopsis . the involvement of additional _PROTEIN_ proteins in this process and details concerning the manner in which cellulose is deposited in the mucilage pocket are unknown . here we show that both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are highly _PROTEIN_ in this cell type at the time of mucilage synthesis and localize to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ adjacent to the mucilage pocket . the isoxaben and isoxaben mutants affecting _PROTEIN_ show defects consistent with altered mucilage cellulose biosynthesis . _PROTEIN_ can interact with _PROTEIN_ in vitro and green _METHOD_ protein tagged _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ proteins move in a linear unidirectional fashion around the cytoplasmic column of the cell parallel with the surface of the seed in a pattern similar to that of cortical microtubules . consistent with this movement cytological evidence suggests that the mucilage is coiled around the columella and unwinds during mucilage extrusion to form a linear ray . mutations in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ affect the speed of mucilage extrusion and mucilage adherence . these findings imply that cellulose fibrils are synthesized in an ordered helical array around the columella providing a distinct structure to the mucilage that is important for both mucilage extrusion and adherence .
in order to identify _PROTEIN_ involved in cellulose biosynthesis during mucilage deposition we analyzed the _PROTEIN_ of all arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ during seed development using publicly available arabidopsis gene _PROTEIN_ resources . during seed coat epidermal cell differentiation mucilage is actively synthesized in large amounts at approximately to _PROTEIN_ . several genes required for cell wall biosynthesis show increased transcript abundance during this period . the amount of mucilage _PROTEIN_ transcript a gene encoding a rha synthase required for mucilage synthesis increases dramatically from to _PROTEIN_ . under our growth conditions seeds at _PROTEIN_ contain an embryo at the bent cotyledon stage and are at the peak of mucilage biosynthesis . at _PROTEIN_ the embryo is at the mature green stage when mucilage production has ceased and columella biosynthesis is under way . during seed coat development the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ peaks at approximately _PROTEIN_ similar to _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ was more highly _PROTEIN_ at approximately _PROTEIN_ during the heart embryo stage whereas _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ displayed relatively constant _PROTEIN_ levels throughout seed coat development . whole seed _PROTEIN_ data suggest that _PROTEIN_ is the most highly _PROTEIN_ of all _PROTEIN_ during seed development based on publicly available microarray data . we also searched using the seed compendium data set in the online bioinformatics tool _PROTEIN_ angler for _PROTEIN_ genes showing an _PROTEIN_ pattern during seed development positively correlated with that of _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ patterns of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were positively correlated with _PROTEIN_ . the peak of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ correlated with mucilage biosynthesis during this stage both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were more highly _PROTEIN_ than _PROTEIN_ . based on the _PROTEIN_ patterns during mucilage biosynthesis we chose to examine the _PROTEIN_ and intracellular localization of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in seed coat epidermal cells using _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion proteins under the control of their native promoters . previously _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was shown to be present in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ of seed coat epidermal cells during all stages of seed coat development and to complement the mucilage adherence phenotype of _PROTEIN_ . _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ can complement the dwarf phenotype of an allele of _PROTEIN_ yet does not have any obvious mucilage phenotype . at _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was present in seed coat epidermal cells at the interface between the cytoplasmic column and the mucilage pocket . at this stage of seed coat development the subcellular localization of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was nearly identical to that of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . like _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ were _PROTEIN_ throughout the period of mucilage and columella biosynthesis _PROTEIN_ . _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ colocalized with a _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ marker in the cytoplasmic column demonstrating that _PROTEIN_ is present in the _LOCATION_ during mucilage biosynthesis . _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ also partially colocalizes with red _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ tagged _LOCATION_ proton _PROTEIN_ a marker for the trans _LOCATION_ network suggesting that _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ is secreted and recycled similar to _PROTEIN_ in other tissues . we also examined _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and localization in _PROTEIN_ seed coat epidermal cells and no _METHOD_ signal was detected consistent with the hypothesis that _PROTEIN_ is not involved in mucilage biosynthesis in the seed coat . these results show that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ proteins like _PROTEIN_ are present in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ of the cytoplasmic column of seed coat epidermal cells during mucilage biosynthesis . next we sought to identify specific protein protein interactions between _PROTEIN_ using phage display technology . the n terminus of _PROTEIN_ like other _PROTEIN_ has a cys rich _PROTEIN_ type zinc finger domain that has been implicated in mediating protein protein interactions . therefore we cloned the n terminal bp wild type _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and as a negative control a n terminal region with mutations in the coding region that result in the substitution of two cys residues with ala . these constructs were used as bait in a phage display assay . we first tested the ability of n _PROTEIN_ and to bind to zinc using a resorcinol assay . zinc binding by n _PROTEIN_ was directly proportional to the protein concentration while zinc binding of was not suggesting that this mutated version of n _PROTEIN_ is incapable of protein protein interactions . both constructs were _PROTEIN_ and bound to microtiter plate wells . the mr of the protein was as expected for a amino acid protein with a thrombin tag . a seed phage display library was successively biopanned against the n _PROTEIN_ and immobilized proteins . bovine serum albumin and negative controls failed to bind significant amounts of phage display proteins whereas n _PROTEIN_ bound to increasing amounts of protein with each successive biopanning round . this indicates that n _PROTEIN_ was selectively binding proteins displayed on phage and that these interactions are specific . following four successive rounds of biopanning dna from randomly selected phage inserts was isolated amplified and sequenced . roughly of identified inserts were found to be in frame . about of the in frame hits were identified as _PROTEIN_ . the n _PROTEIN_ peptide binds to a region of approximately to amino acids at the n terminus of _PROTEIN_ . a yeast two hybrid assay confirmed the interaction between n _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ while no interaction was detected between _PROTEIN_ and or an empty vector control . therefore _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are coexpressed in seed coat epidermal cells during mucilage biosynthesis and can interact with one another in vitro to form higher order complexes . we used a reverse genetics approach to investigate whether mutations in _PROTEIN_ genes result in altered seed coat mucilage . plants with mutations in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were previously shown to have normal mucilage . plants homozygous for mutations in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were obtained . seeds were shaken in water stained with the pectin dye ruthenium red and compared with wild type and _PROTEIN_ seeds . when seeds are hydrated with gentle shaking mucilage separates into a nonadherent layer and an adherent layer that contains relatively higher amounts of cellulose and remains attached to the parent seed . rr stained columbia wild type seeds showed a large adherent mucilage halo while _PROTEIN_ seeds showed an almost complete loss of mucilage rr staining . the mucilage halo of _PROTEIN_ seeds was smaller than that of wild type seeds yet larger than that of _PROTEIN_ seeds . rr stained _PROTEIN_ mucilage had reduced staining in the outer regions of the halo and the halo margin appeared dentate with regions of concentrated staining above the columella . the _PROTEIN_ mucilage phenotype segregated as a single recessive _LOCATION_ mutation when crossed to col _PROTEIN_ and cosegregated with the _PROTEIN_ point mutation in the progeny . the _PROTEIN_ seed mucilage halo was more compact and more intensely stained by rr compared with the wild type . without shaking no major differences in rr staining were observed between wild type and mutant seeds . in addition both _PROTEIN_ mutants have normal epidermal cell morphology and columella size when mature dry seeds were viewed using scanning electron microscopy _PROTEIN_ . mutations in the other genes examined including _PROTEIN_ did not show any obvious seed mucilage differences compared with the wild type . we examined the location of the _PROTEIN_ insertion and tested if this line fails to produce _PROTEIN_ transcript . the insertion was located in an intron between the and exons of _PROTEIN_ however we were still able to identify transcript in _PROTEIN_ seeds using primers located of the insertion . additionally primers spanning the insertion detected a band of unexpected size when amplifying _PROTEIN_ complementary dna . sequencing of this larger band demonstrates that the insertion is not completely spliced from the _PROTEIN_ mrna and is predicted to cause a premature stop codon in the coding region upstream of the catalytic site that would result in a truncated protein . when examining unstained _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ seeds we were able to clearly observe ray like structures which were less visible in the wild type and not visible in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . the altered rr staining of mucilage and increased visibility of rays in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ seeds suggest altered polysaccharide distribution in mucilage . the distribution of cellulose in the mucilage halo of _PROTEIN_ seeds was investigated using pontamine fast _PROTEIN_ a _METHOD_ stain that binds cellulose . wild type seeds extruded mucilage and outer tangential primary cell walls which remain attached to columellae following extrusion and fluoresced intensely when stained with . two distinct domains were observed in the stained adherent mucilage halo intensely staining rays extending from the top of the columellae to the periphery of the mucilage halo and regions with more diffuse signal between the rays . signals in _PROTEIN_ mucilage were reduced compared with the wild type but rays were still observed above the columellae . interestingly in _PROTEIN_ mutants mucilage had stained rays that appeared longer and were more intense than in the wild type . compared with the wild type _PROTEIN_ had increased mucilage staining while _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ had reduced staining . ray length in stained seeds was quantified by measuring the distance from the top of the columellae to the outer edges of the rays . in total three biological replicates of rays each were measured from multiple seeds for each genotype . while _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutant seeds had much shorter rays than the wild type _PROTEIN_ mutant seeds had much longer rays . the rr and staining results are consistent with the idea that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants have an altered cellulose organization as well as altered structure of the adherent mucilage halo . the two _PROTEIN_ missense mutations induce different _PROTEIN_ protein changes and appear to have distinct effects on seed mucilage structure . next we isolated a _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant . only one homozygous _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant was identified in an population of individuals consistent with _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ being closely linked on chromosome iii . based on rr staining the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant phenotype appears intermediate between both single mutants . mucilage halo widths for the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant were consistently smaller than those of _PROTEIN_ and wild type seeds yet larger than those of _PROTEIN_ seeds . since _PROTEIN_ is not a null mutation and has an effect on ray length opposite to that of _PROTEIN_ interpretation of this double mutant is difficult . however based on the intermediate mucilage phenotype of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ seeds we conclude that both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are involved in mucilage cellulose synthesis and that they are at most partially redundant . we also isolated four _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutants from a segregating population from a cross between both single mutants . no obvious changes in the mucilage phenotype were observed compared with _PROTEIN_ seeds therefore _PROTEIN_ is not necessary for mucilage biosynthesis and does not appear to be redundant with _PROTEIN_ . to further characterize the distribution of cellulose in the adherent mucilage layer seeds were exposed to solutions of proteins carrying one of two _PROTEIN_ binding modules . recognizes crystalline cellulose structures whereas recognizes amorphous cellulose structures . seeds were first hydrated in water for h exposed to or and counterstained with to detect the cellulose in the mucilage . negative controls lacking or other primary antibodies showed no detectable _METHOD_ in the mucilage halo when viewed under similar imaging conditions . results were similar for multiple seeds from three independent biological replicates . stained the adherent mucilage layer highlighting the rays above the columella and the diffuse mucilage . in contrast most strongly labeled the outer edge of the mucilage halo and the top of the rays . signals were reduced in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ seeds compared with the wild type while the halo size in _PROTEIN_ seeds was larger than that in the wild type and appeared more concentrated around the rays . these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ has reduced crystalline cellulose in mucilage while _PROTEIN_ has an altered distribution of crystalline cellulose in seed mucilage . labeling was reduced compared with in all genotypes so laser intensity and detection sensitivity were increased to facilitate imaging . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ seeds had reduced labeling and altered signal distribution compared with the wild type consistent with altered cellulose distribution and amounts in _PROTEIN_ mucilage . we investigated pectin distribution in _PROTEIN_ mucilage with two pectin specific antibodies . ccrc recognizes the unbranched backbone of rg i whereas recognizes partially methylesterified hg . in wild type seeds ccrc labeled the entire adherent mucilage halo with increased labeling at the periphery of the halo and around the end of the rays . ccrc signal in _PROTEIN_ mucilage surrounded the ray and was reduced compared with the wild type . in _PROTEIN_ mucilage ccrc signal was similarly focused at the rays yet farther from the seed surface . the labeling pattern of _PROTEIN_ seeds was similar to that of wild type seeds but appeared more intense . labeled the inner region of the adherent halo in wild type seeds and loosely surrounded the rays . signal in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mucilage was reduced compared with the wild type and only observed at the base of the ray near the columellae . relative to the wild type the signal appeared to be more abundant in _PROTEIN_ mucilage and was more closely associated with the rays . in summary the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutations cause distinct changes in the organization of cellulose and pectins in adherent mucilage suggesting a close association between these cell wall polysaccharides . since the structure of the adherent mucilage halo was changed in _PROTEIN_ mutant seeds soluble mucilage and whole seed monosaccharide compositions were analyzed to quantify these changes . seeds were shaken in water and the nonadherent mucilage fraction was isolated hydrolyzed and analyzed using high performance anion exchange chromatography . similar to previous reports _PROTEIN_ mutant seeds had significantly more nonadherent rha compared with the wild type indicating that _PROTEIN_ mucilage is less adherent than that of the wild type . while _PROTEIN_ seeds showed no significant change in rha or gala amounts _PROTEIN_ had a significant reduction in the amount of nonadherent rha compared with the wild type suggesting increased mucilage adherence . gala amounts in _PROTEIN_ seeds showed the same trend as rha but this reduction was not statistically significant . we next examined whole seed monosaccharide content in order to determine if the observed defects result from altered mucilage adherence or changes in the amount of mucilage synthesized . wild type _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ seeds had similar rha or gala amounts compared with the wild type indicating that the biosynthesis of pectin was not affected by mutations in the _PROTEIN_ genes . glc levels were reduced in _PROTEIN_ seeds but not in _PROTEIN_ seeds suggesting that cellulose biosynthesis is reduced only in _PROTEIN_ seeds . the comparison of whole seed and mucilage monosaccharide contents suggests that _PROTEIN_ seeds have increased mucilage adherence . we quantified the crystalline cellulose content in whole seeds using the anthrone reagent to determine if _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ affect cellulose biosynthesis . crystalline cellulose amounts were significantly lower in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ seeds compared with wild type seeds . the mean amount of crystalline cellulose in _PROTEIN_ seeds was also lower than in the wild type but it was not significantly different . these reductions in crystalline cellulose are consistent with mutations affecting cellulose biosynthesis in mucilage and whole seeds . unlike _PROTEIN_ which has reduced crystalline cellulose and less glc in seeds _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ only show changes in crystalline cellulose levels suggesting that ixr mutant seeds synthesize cellulose polymers with altered properties . the structure of rg i in the mucilage pocket has a strong influence on the ability of the mucilage to extrude when exposed to water . mutations in genes that encode the mucilage modifying enzymes _PROTEIN_ and beta _PROTEIN_ significantly impair mucilage extrusion . to investigate if the disruption of cellulose content in mucilage also affects mucilage release we compared the extrusion rates of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . when hydrated all _PROTEIN_ and wild type seeds released mucilage very quickly while _PROTEIN_ seeds had a delayed mucilage release . the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant seeds released mucilage at an even slower rate than the _PROTEIN_ single mutant suggesting that cellulose synthesized by _PROTEIN_ facilitates mucilage extrusion . to test this hypothesis we examined how _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ seeds extrude mucilage in water limiting conditions . compared with the wild type a lower proportion of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutant seeds released mucilage in solutions with increasing concentrations of polyethylene glycol . since _PROTEIN_ enhanced the _PROTEIN_ extrusion defect and _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mucilage release was delayed compared with wild type seeds with reduced water availability cellulose appears to promote mucilage release . values are percentages of seeds showing any degree of mucilage release for each genotype when hydrated without shaking for the indicated time or after shaking on a rotator for min . the number of seeds examined for each genotype is shown in parentheses . values indicate the percentage of seeds showing any degree of mucilage release for each genotype . n for each genotype . we also examined the ability of _PROTEIN_ seeds to extrude mucilage in solutions of calcium chloride and edta . unesterified gala regions of hg polymers can be cross linked by calcium bridges resulting in more cohesive pectin gels . mutant seeds were hydrated in a solution of which is expected to increase cross linking or in edta which sequesters divalent cations such as and disrupts cross linking . edta treated _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ seeds showed mucilage halos similar in size to the wild type indicating a partial rescue of their mucilage defects . in contrast treated _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ seeds displayed much smaller mucilage halos than the wild type and frequently failed to release any mucilage again suggesting that changes in mucilage cellulose can reduce mucilage extrusion . the rays of extruded mucilage are composed at least in part of cellulose and pectins . prior to extrusion these polymers are tightly packed in the mucilage pockets of the seed coat epidermal cells . while the length of wild type rays is approximately the height of the mucilage pocket is only . rays must either expand vertically roughly five to six times the height of the mucilage pocket or be organized in the apoplast around the columella . to understand how cellulose is deposited during mucilage synthesis and ultimately contributes to the formation of rays we examined the localization and dynamics of _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ proteins in seed coat epidermal cells . _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ are arranged in linear arrays around the cytoplasmic column during mucilage biosynthesis . time lapse images of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ indicated that all three _PROTEIN_ proteins moved in a circumferential manner around the cytoplasmic column parallel with the outer tangential surface of the cell . this pattern was enhanced when imaging _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ seed coat epidermal cells for min at s per image . _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was calculated to have a mean velocity of nm similar to the velocity of unphosphorylated _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in hypocotyl cells . _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ had a calculated mean velocity of nm while _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ had a calculated mean velocity of nm . despite the slight variation in the mean velocity of different _PROTEIN_ the three proteins showed a similar overall distribution of velocities . surprisingly all _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ examined moved in a unidirectional clockwise manner . to test whether this distribution pattern was related to the function of _PROTEIN_ complexes we treated seeds _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ with two cellulose biosynthesis inhibitors isoxaben which induces a rapid internalization of _PROTEIN_ from the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and dichlorobenzonitrile which prevents the removal of _PROTEIN_ from the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . isoxaben treatment abolished the circular distribution of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ around the cytoplasmic column and increased the amount of intracellular _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ signal while dcb enhanced the circular pattern and increased the relative signal intensity of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . as a negative control the seed coat epidermal cell distribution of _PROTEIN_ a _LOCATION_ bound _PROTEIN_ binding cassette transporter involved in cuticular wax biosynthesis was examined . _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ had a diffuse distribution along the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ of seed coat epidermal cells and did not resemble the linear striated pattern of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ complexes are guided by cortical microtubule arrays . in _PROTEIN_ seed coat epidermal cells microtubules are very prominent surrounding the cytoplasmic column just beneath the _LOCATION_ . using an _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ translational fusion under the control of the promoter we further examined this distribution . _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ appeared in cortical linear arrays encircling the cytoplasmic column in a pattern that closely resembled the localization of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . transmission electron microscopy confirmed this distribution of cortical microtubules showing a parallel microtubule array perpendicular to the apical basal axis of the cell . furthermore in sections just beneath the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ we observed microtubules in a cortical linear array parallel to the tangential primary wall . at _PROTEIN_ seeds were treated with oryzalin a microtubule destabilizing drug which disrupted _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ localization and reduced the movement of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ particles in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . the mean velocity of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ seeds treated with _METHOD_ was nm while their mean velocity in oryzalin treated seeds was nm . this suggests that _PROTEIN_ movement during mucilage biosynthesis depends on cortical microtubules . guided by microtubules _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ appear to circle around the cytoplasmic column parallel to the outer tangential cell wall . the localization and direction of movement of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ suggest that cellulose is deposited in the mucilage pocket in a circular pattern parallel to the seed surface . however in extruded mucilage the cellulose in rays appears straight extending perpendicularly from the seed surface . these data suggest that the cellulose must be coiled in mature mucilage and unwind during extrusion . we examined the structure of hydrated mucilage using variable pressure scanning electron microscopy . mucilage was extruded by exposing seeds to water and then the organization of partially dehydrated material on the seed surface was examined by vpsem . the mucilage on the seed surface appeared to be organized in spiral structures around the central columella . we next examined stained mucilage in more detail with confocal microscopy in an attempt to identify similar structures . although wild type rays are straight the longer and _PROTEIN_ rays of _PROTEIN_ showed a helical distribution of signals suggesting that the cellulose was coiled prior to extrusion . since structural elements in mucilage appear to be coiled around the columella but are relatively straight following extrusion in the wild type we investigated this transition in more detail by observing mucilage during hydration and expansion . mucilage is normally extruded within approximately s of seed hydration and is difficult to examine . to overcome this limitation we analyzed the recently characterized flying _PROTEIN_ mutant which has seed coat epidermal cells that show delayed outer wall rupture and mucilage release . the outer primary walls of _PROTEIN_ often detach from the columellae as discs that move to the edge of the adherent mucilage halo . since the _PROTEIN_ discs remain attached to the top of the rays they can be used to visualize mucilage expansion and track the formation of rays . we examined the hydration of _PROTEIN_ seeds and observed that out of discs rotated counterclockwise upon mucilage extrusion . the degree of rotation was difficult to quantify but most discs rotated approximately as mucilage expanded suggesting that the cellulosic ray they are attached to is initially coiled around the columella and unwinds during extrusion . the rotation of _PROTEIN_ discs in a predominantly counterclockwise fashion is consistent with a clockwise orientation of cellulose microfibrils as suggested by the movement of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ .
