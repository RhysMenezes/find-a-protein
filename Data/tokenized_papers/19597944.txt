the last steps of the leu biosynthetic pathway and the met chain elongation cycle for _PROTEIN_ formation share identical reaction types suggesting a close evolutionary relationship of these pathways . both pathways involve the condensation of acetyl coa and a oxo acid isomerization of the resulting malate derivative to form a malate derivative the oxidation decarboxylation of the malate derivative to give an elongated oxo acid and transamination to generate the corresponding amino acid . we have now analyzed the genes encoding the isomerization reaction the second step of this sequence in arabidopsis thaliana . one gene encodes the large subunit and three encode small subunits of this enzyme referred to as isopropylmalate isomerase with respect to the leu pathway . metabolic profiling of large subunit mutants revealed accumulation of intermediates of both leu biosynthesis and met chain elongation and an altered composition of aliphatic _PROTEIN_ demonstrating the function of this gene in both pathways . in contrast the small subunits appear to be specialized to either leu biosynthesis or met chain elongation . green _METHOD_ protein tagging experiments _METHOD_ the import of one of the ipmi small subunits into the chloroplast the localization of the met chain elongation pathway in these organelles . these results suggest the presence of different heterodimeric ipmis in arabidopsis chloroplasts with distinct substrate specificities for leu or _PROTEIN_ metabolism determined by the nature of the different small subunit . the online version of this article contains supplementary material which is available to authorized users .
isopropylmalate isomerase in bacteria is present as a dimer whose subunits are distinct and vary almost twofold in size . the arabidopsis ipmi has a similar structure . the genome contains a single gene for the large subunit _PROTEIN_ and three genes for the small subunits of this enzyme _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ whose sequences align closely with the respective sequences from e. coli and an isopropylmalate isomerase of the single subunit type found in fungi . the proteins from arabidopsis have identity at the amino acid level to their counterparts from e. coli . the arabidopsis large subunit also aligns well to the n terminal part of the single subunit type of ipmi from candida albicans _PROTEIN_ and the small subunit aligns well with the c terminal part . the alignments of both the arabidopsis large and small subunits to their respective microorganism counterparts also revealed n terminal extensions which might function as _LOCATION_ targeting signals . to obtain information about the function of the large subunit of the isopropylmalate isomerase in vivo we investigated three independent t dna insertion mutants obtained from the salk sail and gabi kat collections genotyping of respective plants and sequencing of the t dna flanking sequences identified the t dnas within the utr of the gene either about or eleven nucleotides upstream of the translation start codon . these t dna alleles were designated ipmi _PROTEIN_ ipmi _PROTEIN_ and ipmi _PROTEIN_ .fig . of three independent ipmi _PROTEIN_ mutants the gene encoding the large subunit of isopropylmalate _PROTEIN_ contains exons . the first three exons are enlarged and the approximate localizations of the t dna insertions of three independent lines and of the oligonucleotides used for genotyping are given . further details are given in supplemental fig . characterization of three independent ipmi _PROTEIN_ mutants the gene encoding the large subunit of isopropylmalate _PROTEIN_ contains exons . the first three exons are enlarged and the approximate localizations of the t dna insertions of three independent lines and of the oligonucleotides used for genotyping are given . further details are given in supplemental fig . transcript analysis of homozygous ipmi _PROTEIN_ and plants by rt pcrs covering the complete reading frame detected correctly spliced ipmi _PROTEIN_ mrna suggesting that the t dna insertions in the region do not yield knockouts . but the _PROTEIN_ that the t dna insertions in these lines are located just downstream of the transcription initiation site imply that their presence might influence transcription of the ipmi _PROTEIN_ gene in these mutants . as expected quantitative real time rt pcr revealed that the steady state levels of the ipmi _PROTEIN_ transcripts in these mutants are substantially reduced in seedlings and week old rosette leaves . in the ipmi _PROTEIN_ mutant mrna levels are reduced to and of the wild type standard in seedlings and rosette leaves respectively while ipmi _PROTEIN_ transcript levels are reduced to and of wild type in these tissues of ipmi _PROTEIN_ plants . strongest reduction is seen in ipmi _PROTEIN_ seedlings while the ipmi _PROTEIN_ mrna level in ipmi _PROTEIN_ reaches about of the wild type level in leaves . thus all insertions cause a reduced ipmi _PROTEIN_ steady state transcript level which is most severe in the ipmi _PROTEIN_ mutant . further cdna analysis revealed that transcription of ipmi _PROTEIN_ gene in ipmi _PROTEIN_ and plants starts within the t dna insertion . while the insertion in ipmi _PROTEIN_ has no effect on the ipmi _PROTEIN_ reading frame the insertion nucleotides upstream of the _PROTEIN_ in the ipmi _PROTEIN_ mutant introduces another in frame _PROTEIN_ and thus extends the reading frame at the n terminus . moreover the insertion in this plant line promotes a severe delay in development which is not observed for the ipmi _PROTEIN_ and mutants .fig . t dna insertions in the utr of the ipmi _PROTEIN_ gene change transcript levels in different tissues . real time quantitative rt pcr was performed three times on total rna obtained from seedlings flowers and rosette leaves of week old ipmi _PROTEIN_ ipmi _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and wild type plants . transcript levels in these mutants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ are given relative to the mrna levels measured in wild type the t dna insertions in the utr of the ipmi _PROTEIN_ gene change transcript levels in different tissues . real time quantitative rt pcr was performed three times on total rna obtained from seedlings flowers and rosette leaves of week old ipmi _PROTEIN_ ipmi _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and wild type plants . transcript levels in these mutants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ are given relative to the mrna levels measured in wild type to investigate the function of the ipmi _PROTEIN_ gene in vivo the levels of free amino acids were determined in week old plants and seeds of the three homozygous ipmi _PROTEIN_ mutants and wild type controls . in leaves ipmi _PROTEIN_ plants exhibit the weakest chemical phenotype with only two significant changes in comparison to wild type . in contrast many more changes were seen between the ipmi _PROTEIN_ and plants and wild type . most striking is the accumulation of s methylmethionine in rosette leaves of both mutants . this is accompanied by twofold increased levels of met _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . of the branched chain amino acids only val is significantly elevated in the ipmi _PROTEIN_ mutant _PROTEIN_ whereas no alterations were detected in leu as well as ile levels . apart from that other amino acids show almost exclusively minor alterations . in seeds many significant but mostly moderate changes were found when comparing among the mutants and wild type . these alterations do not reveal any clear pattern except that smm was found in the ipmi _PROTEIN_ and mutants while this transport or storage form of met is barely detectable in ipmi _PROTEIN_ and is not observed in wild type seeds _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . the observed variations in the amino acid and _PROTEIN_ contents among the different wild type lines are likely due to the _PROTEIN_ that not all plants were grown at the same time . even very minor variations in the experimental growth conditions can lead to alterations in metabolites such as _PROTEIN_ or amino acids . however all mutants and their corresponding wild type lines were always grown together and analyzed in parallel which allows unambiguous conclusions about the effect of the gene knockout.table content in leaves gs typeipmi _PROTEIN_ wild typeaipmi _PROTEIN_ wild typebipmi _PROTEIN_ wild met _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_

although the amino acid profiles did not indicate a function of ipmi _PROTEIN_ in leu biosynthesis we searched for further evidence on this point by lc _METHOD_ analysis of methanolic extracts obtained during _PROTEIN_ isolation . comparison of the ipmi _PROTEIN_ chromatogram with that obtained from wild type leaf extracts revealed two extra peaks in the mutant corresponding to molecular _METHOD_ of and . the metabolite with a molecular _METHOD_ of was identified to be the enzyme substrate isopropylmalate by similarity of retention time and _METHOD_ fragmentation to those of authentic ipm . a quantitative analysis of all three ipmi _PROTEIN_ mutants revealed an average ipm content of and mg/g dry weight in leaves of ipmi _PROTEIN_ and ipmi _PROTEIN_ mutants respectively while this metabolite was undetectable in the ipmi _PROTEIN_ plants.fig . of isopropylmalate and of propylmalate structures of isopropylmalate and of propylmalate compound was identified by spectroscopic methods as propylmalate an oxidation product of propylmalate an intermediate in the second round of met chain elongation . this compound is formed by condensation of methylthio oxopentanoate and acetyl coa catalyzed by a methylthioalkylmalate synthase _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . in contrast to ipm this metabolite accumulates in all three mutants while it is not seen in wild type . relative levels of propylmalate are in ipmi _PROTEIN_ and plants . in summary the accumulation of ipm and propylmalate in the ipmi _PROTEIN_ mutants indicates a function of ipmi _PROTEIN_ in both the biosynthesis of leu and in the met chain elongation pathway of _PROTEIN_ formation . to gain more information on the role of ipmi _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ biosynthesis the profiles of aliphatic _PROTEIN_ in ipmi _PROTEIN_ mutants and wild type lines were compared in leaves of week old plants and in seeds . the mutants exhibited a strong trend towards increases in short chain _PROTEIN_ accompanied by reductions in long chain aliphatic _PROTEIN_ . in both leaves and seeds all _PROTEIN_ were amply increased while all and _PROTEIN_ species are strongly reduced . in seeds also methylthiopentylglucosinolate is reduced while the _PROTEIN_ of methylsulfinylpentylglucosinolate _METHOD_ has only been measured in ipmi _PROTEIN_ . this redistribution of _PROTEIN_ chain length is particularly strong in the ipmi _PROTEIN_ mutant where all and _PROTEIN_ are reduced to undetectable amounts in both seeds and leaves . the _PROTEIN_ can be either increased or _PROTEIN_ depending on the compound and mutant . in summary these metabolite profiles along with the accumulation of smm constitute strong evidence for the participation of the ipmi _PROTEIN_ gene in the biosynthesis of aliphatic _PROTEIN_ . in our study of the ipmi _PROTEIN_ genes we investigated two mutants for ipmi _PROTEIN_ and one mutant each for ipmi _PROTEIN_ and ipmi _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . for ipmi _PROTEIN_ no plants homozygous for the t dna allele could be obtained in either analyzed line . when siliques from heterozygous plants were inspected they exhibited abnormalities in seed maturation . in line salk seed development _METHOD_ to be aborted at a very early stage while seed maturation is interrupted at a _PROTEIN_ phase in salk . since in both independent lines the number of mature seeds is substantially reduced and no homozygous mutants could be obtained an intact ipmi _PROTEIN_ gene _METHOD_ to be crucial for the development of mature viable seeds . in contrast homozygous ipmi and mutants could be established and the presence of the t dna insertion was confirmed near the center and the beginning of the reading frames respectively . northern analysis of ipmi and rt pcr assays of ipmi plants revealed the absence of mature mrnas in the homozygous plants and the knockout of these genes by the t dnas . both lines which did not show any macroscopic phenotype were then cultivated for metabolite analyses.fig . of ipmi and ipmi mutants . t dna insertions were confirmed in line salk near the center of the ipmi _PROTEIN_ gene a and in line _PROTEIN_ within the _PROTEIN_ of the ipmi _PROTEIN_ reading frame . oligonucleotides used for genotyping and rt pcr are given as vertical arrows . left border sequences were detected at both extremities of the insertion in salk b a northern blot hybridization detected a kb mrna in wild type

for ipmi _PROTEIN_ detected product of the expected size in wild type cdna but not in cdna from homozygous ipmi plants . a control rt pcr _PROTEIN_ was performed as described in legend of fig . the free amino acid content of the leaves and seeds of ipmi plants was not substantially different from that of the wild type . the statistically significant changes were only to fold . no significant alterations were seen for leu while ile was slightly _PROTEIN_ in leaves and very moderately elevated in seeds and val was found to be fold enriched in seeds . met levels often changed in mutants compromised in other steps of the met chain elongation pathway were unaffected . in addition smm which usually accumulates in met chain elongation mutants was not detectable in the ipmi mutant . the profile of the methionine derived _PROTEIN_ in leaves of ipmi also did not show substantial variations from that of wild type plants . only an increase in _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ in _METHOD_ and are observed . in contrast seeds exhibited clear elevations of total _PROTEIN_ content as well as total methionine derived _PROTEIN_ content . apart from benzoyloxybutylglucosinolate all and _PROTEIN_ are elevated in the mutant . in _METHOD_ of absolute values the most prominent increase was observed for the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ species in seeds of arabidopsis accession columbia . the increase of these short chain _PROTEIN_ is by trend similar to the elevated levels of these _PROTEIN_ species in the ipmi _PROTEIN_ mutants . in contrast to the latter long chain _PROTEIN_ are either increased or _PROTEIN_ . in leaves and seeds of the ipmi mutant there were also few significant changes in amino acid content . in leaves reductions were found for gln and gly which help account for the reduction of the total amount of free amino acids . in seeds moderate increases were measured for asn ile leu and ser . as in ipmi met levels were unchanged in ipmi and smm could not be detected . profiling of _PROTEIN_ in both leaves and seeds also did not reveal any substantial changes from wild type levels . both the biosynthesis of leu and the met chain elongation pathway are known to occur in chloroplasts suggesting that the ipmi subunits must be imported into these organelles . consistent with this suggestion all four ipmi subunits of arabidopsis are predicted to have chloroplast targeting sequences by amino acid sequence alignments and an in silico analysis of subcellular sorting by two prediction servers . to experimentally verify these predictions the full length reading frame of one of the small subunit genes _PROTEIN_ was fused in frame to the end of the gene encoding the green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ in the vector _METHOD_ . this construct was transiently _PROTEIN_ in tobacco protoplasts and stably transformed into arabidopsis plants . transformed protoplasts from tobacco and protoplasts released from leaves of transgenic arabidopsis plants were then inspected by _METHOD_ microscopy . the patterns of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ were identical demonstrating an import of the ipmi _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein into chloroplasts . this indicates that the native ipmi _PROTEIN_ protein is also imported into chloroplasts in vivo.fig . localization of the small subunit of isopropylmalate isomerase encoded by . the full length reading

plants used for amino acid and _PROTEIN_ analyses were cultivated as reported before . the contents of amino acids and _PROTEIN_ were measured in approximately week old rosette leaves and seeds according to methods described previously . between and replicates were analyzed for the individual lines . plant material was obtained from a single cultivation per line . details are given in supplemental table . additionally the flow through fractions of the anion exchange chromatography performed in the course of _PROTEIN_ analysis of leaf extracts of mutant and wild type plants were compared by lc _METHOD_ using a bruker esquire ion trap _METHOD_ spectrometer operated in negative ion mode in the range m/z coupled to an agilent series hplc . elution was accomplished using a nucleodur sphinx rp column . mobile phases were formic acid and acetonitrile starting with a for min followed by a gradient to b in min . the subtraction of the _METHOD_ spectrometer total ion chromatogram of wild type plants from that of the mutants identified two additional peaks in ipmi _PROTEIN_ extracts not found in wild type extracts corresponding to molecular _METHOD_ of and . the former was unambiguously identified as isopropylmalate by identical retention times with an authentic ipm standard in hplc and identical fragmentation patterns in _METHOD_ experiments in the negative ionization mode as described above . propylmalate was isolated from aqueous leaf extracts from ipmi _PROTEIN_ plants by preparative hplc and analyzed by _METHOD_ _METHOD_ as described above both positive and negative ionization modes were employed . high resolution electrospray ionization _METHOD_ spectra were recorded on a bruker microtof _METHOD_ spectrometer . nmr spectra were recorded on a bruker av spectrometer equipped with a cryoplatform . nmr _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and hmbc spectra were recorded using a mm tci cryoprobe . the operating frequencies were mhz for acquisition of and mhz for spectra . samples were measured at k in methanol . chemical shifts are given in ppm referenced to the remaining solvent signals . propylmalate and nmr low resolution esi _METHOD_ m/z and m/z _METHOD_ experiments with _METHOD_ resulted in following fragments fragments of m/z _PROTEIN_ fragments of m/z _PROTEIN_ . the molecular formula of compound was determined to be _METHOD_ from the ion peak at m/z in high resolution esi _METHOD_ nmr spectroscopy _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ revealed _PROTEIN_ signals of which two low field resonances at and ppm indicated the _PROTEIN_ functions of the substituted malate followed by another quaternary _PROTEIN_ resonance at ppm . in the proton spectrum only the signal at ppm is well resolved . all other proton resonances are higher order multiplets . the connectivity was deduced from prominent resonances in the hmbc spectrum for h and the s methyl singlet as well as by _PROTEIN_ cross peaks . total dna and rna respectively were isolated as described previously . pcr rt pcr and northern blot hybridization were done following established protocols . oligonucleotide sequences are available on request . real time quantitative rt pcr was performed using transcriptor high fidelity cdna synthesis and light cycler sybr green i master kits on a light cycler real time pcr system according to instruction given by the manufacturer . data of three samples were evaluated using the light cycler software . relative transcript levels were measured with respect to validated reference genes encoding ubiquitin conjugating enzyme _PROTEIN_ and protein phosphatase subunit _PROTEIN_ with established primer pairs _PROTEIN_ . oligonucleotides for the ipmi _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ analysis were selected using the primer design tool at the ncbi home page . standard methods of molecular biology were done as described . _METHOD_ tagging experiments were performed following established procedures . dna cdna and proteins sequences were investigated using the blast tools and clustal w .
