in higher plants cellulose is synthesized by so called rosette protein complexes with cellulose synthases _PROTEIN_ as catalytic subunits of the complex . the _PROTEIN_ are divided into two distinct families three of which are thought to be specialized for the primary cell wall and three for the secondary cell wall . in this article the potential of primary and secondary _PROTEIN_ forming a functional rosette complex has been investigated . the _LOCATION_ based yeast two hybrid and biomolecular _METHOD_ _METHOD_ were used to assess the interactions between three primary _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and three secondary _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ . the results showed that all primary _PROTEIN_ can physically interact both in vitro and in planta with all secondary _PROTEIN_ . although _PROTEIN_ are broadly capable of interacting in pairwise combinations they are not all able to form functional complexes in planta . analysis of transgenic lines showed that _PROTEIN_ can partially rescue defects in the primary cell wall biosynthesis in a weak _PROTEIN_ mutant . green _METHOD_ protein _PROTEIN_ protein fusions revealed that when _PROTEIN_ was replaced by _PROTEIN_ in the primary rosette the velocity of the mixed complexes was slightly faster than the native primary complexes . _PROTEIN_ in turn can partly rescue defects in secondary cell wall biosynthesis in a _PROTEIN_ mutant resulting in an increase of cellulose content relative to _PROTEIN_ . these results demonstrate that sufficient parallels exist between the primary and secondary complexes for cross functionality and open the possibility that mixed complexes of primary and secondary _PROTEIN_ may occur at particular times .
all possible combinations of one to one interactions between the primary _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and secondary _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were assessed using the split ubiquitin mbyth system _METHOD_ . upon testing the interactions between the three primary _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ the results show that all the primary _PROTEIN_ were able to form both homodimers and heterodimers with all the other primary _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ confirming previous reports using bimolecular _METHOD_ analysis . these protein interactions were carried out with each of the primary _PROTEIN_ as bait and as prey and both sets of experiments showed the same results . the lack of growth in the negative controls indicated that the interactions were specific as an unrelated protein _PROTEIN_ as prey and an empty prey vector were not able to activate the system . in a second step the interactions were determined between three members of the primary _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and the secondary _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ using the same mbyth system . although with different interaction strength the six primary and secondary _PROTEIN_ all had the ability to form heterodimers in all possible combinations . the bifc technique offers the possibility of analyzing protein interactions in living plant cells . to analyze the interaction between the three primary _PROTEIN_ and the secondary _PROTEIN_ in planta the bifc assays were used and the results are shown in figure . it was observed that yellow _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was reconstituted for all of the combinations indicating that all _METHOD_ from the primary _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ can interact with those of the secondary _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . the intensity of the _METHOD_ signals was not the same for all combinations . upon interaction of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ a weaker signal was observed which may indicate that dimerization is less stable . all the pairwise _PROTEIN_ combinations were carried out with each of the _PROTEIN_ fused with the n and c terminus of the _METHOD_ and both sets of experiments showed the same results . to determine whether _PROTEIN_ from the secondary complex could enter and function in the primary complex a series of promoter swap constructs were generated . combinations of each of the primary promoters were placed upstream of each of the secondary _PROTEIN_ coding sequences both with and without an n terminal _METHOD_ . we named these constructs px cy based on the promoter and coding sequence used . a construct containing the _PROTEIN_ promoter is while one containing the coding sequence of _PROTEIN_ is giving the combination of the two the name . if _METHOD_ is n terminally fused we place the letter g before the coding sequence . the fusions with _METHOD_ and without _METHOD_ were transformed into the mutant lines corresponding to the promoter used . the _PROTEIN_ promoter constructs were transformed into the temperature sensitive _PROTEIN_ mutant _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ promoter constructs were transformed into the weak _PROTEIN_ mutant and _PROTEIN_ promoter constructs were transformed into the _PROTEIN_ null line prc . in addition the weak _PROTEIN_ mutant was transformed with the g construct . a partial rescue in the g line was observed . etiolated seedlings of g in were not significantly different in hypocotyl length from columbia plants or from g plants up to d of growth . after d however g does not elongate as rapidly as columbia or g . the _PROTEIN_ rescue of the _PROTEIN_ primary cell wall mutants without _METHOD_ was also incomplete . no rescue was apparent for either g or g . the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ constructs did not rescue any of the primary cell wall mutants either with or without the n terminal _METHOD_ . reverse transcription pcr analysis of _METHOD_ transcript revealed that _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ gene in the g mutant was similar to _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ gene in the rescue mutant as shown in supplemental figure . spinning disk confocal microscopy analysis in d old g and g etiolated seedlings revealed _METHOD_ signal in _LOCATION_ bodies and in _LOCATION_ particles . the velocity distributions of both g and g were calculated by tracking individual particles in time lapse movies . this revealed that _LOCATION_ particles were approximately half as abundant in g compared with g . interestingly complexes in the g line migrated about faster than g complexes a difference that is significant at p < in a two tailed t test . this phenomenon was consistently observed across biological replicates _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ acquired across d tracking around _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ labeled complexes . the number of _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ localized particles _PROTEIN_ for both g and g lines after d of etiolation but the _PROTEIN_ in particle number was far more pronounced in g making it difficult to track enough particles for an adequate characterization of particle velocity in g after d of growth . using the total distance traveled by all _PROTEIN_ complexes observed in cells of the g and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ lines we estimated the relative cellulose produced in those lines over the course of the movies . tracked complexes in _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ traveled an average of pixels per cell compared with pixels in g . this estimated the cellulose content of g at around lower than the content in the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ control . chemical determination of the cellulose content showed similar results of lower cellulose content in the g mutant relative to the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ control . movies were selected in which the _LOCATION_ of a single cell spans the field of view . three minute movies were taken with frames captured at s time intervals . particles tracked for longer than s were counted . the difference between g and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ is significant at p < . in g and g plants confocal microscopy revealed _METHOD_ in _LOCATION_ bodies but no _LOCATION_ complexes were detected . additionally small _METHOD_ bodies were faintly visible in focal planes at or near the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ that did not behave like linearly moving complexes and whose behavior resembled previously reported subpopulations of smaccs . in g the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ signal in smaccs was more apparent when plants were grown at the restrictive temperature of . to determine whether the failure of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ to reach _LOCATION_ complexes was due to the compromised _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ proteins in these mutant lines or to competition from the wild type _PROTEIN_ the g construct was transformed into the wild type generating line g . these lines did not have any noticeable phenotype indicating that the incompleteness of the rescue in g was most likely not due to a dominant negative effect of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . g plants had strong _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in _LOCATION_ bodies but no signal from _LOCATION_ complexes . the same _METHOD_ patterns were observed when _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was transformed into either prc or _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ was strongly visible in _LOCATION_ bodies but not visible in _LOCATION_ complexes . these lines retained their phenotypes prc was radially swollen and dwarfed as was _PROTEIN_ when grown at the restrictive temperature . this is consistent with the hypothesis that _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ is excluded from _LOCATION_ complexes in the presence of a wild type copy of _PROTEIN_ as both prc and _PROTEIN_ retain wild type copies of _PROTEIN_ . one can not exclude the possibility that the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ containing rosettes are somehow blocked in transport to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . the _PROTEIN_ profile comparison between primary _PROTEIN_ and secondary _PROTEIN_ indicates that secondary _PROTEIN_ are more stringently controlled therefore the promoter of _PROTEIN_ was chosen to be used in the promoter swap constructs . the null mutants of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were identified by pcr identification of the t dna flanking regions . all the secondary promoter swap constructs were transformed into _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . among all the possible combinations only partially complemented the _PROTEIN_ phenotype . the leaf morphologies of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were indistinguishable from each other all displaying dark green and reduced leaf size . the leaf of _PROTEIN_ was reverted to almost its wild type size . however the margin of the leaf was not as even as that of the wild type . the adult homozygous plants of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were dwarfed _PROTEIN_ due to shorter internodes . in addition _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were almost completely sterile . _PROTEIN_ partially recovered the elongation defect in internodes and these recoveries were more obvious in the _PROTEIN_ stem . in addition plants were fully fertile . a deficiency in secondary cell wall cellulose deposition leads to collapsed xylem cells as shown in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ plants . examination of the stem sections from _PROTEIN_ showed its collapsed xylem phenotype . the xylem cells in _PROTEIN_ showed a similar phenotype to the wild type indicating that complemented the collapsed xylem phenotype in _PROTEIN_ . in both _METHOD_ and leaves the cellulose content in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ was reduced confirming the results of citation . lesions in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ plants resulted in a _PROTEIN_ in cellulose of more than in _METHOD_ . correlating with the morphological recovery the cellulose content of _PROTEIN_ was increased in both _METHOD_ and leaves indicating that functionally incorporated into the secondary _PROTEIN_ complexes .
the full length complementary dnas from arabidopsis were obtained from the _PROTEIN_ bioresource center _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and as well as _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . the cdnas of the _PROTEIN_ genes were amplified by pcr using the phusion dna polymerase with the primers listed in supplemental table . the resulting pcr products were digested and ligated into the vector and the padsl nx vector _METHOD_ . bait and prey _PROTEIN_ was regulated by the and _PROTEIN_ promoters respectively . the sequences of the inserts were confirmed by sanger sequence analysis . the bait and prey proteins were fused n terminally to the cub transcription _PROTEIN_ reporter cassette of the vector and the nubg cassette of the vector padsl nx respectively . the interactions between the _PROTEIN_ proteins were assayed using the split ubiquitin mbyth system with the yeast strain in the split ubiquitin system kit _METHOD_ . the assays were performed according to supplier instructions _LOCATION_ . this system was used to detect interaction between the _PROTEIN_ in which each _PROTEIN_ was fused to the cub coding sequence of vector the cub transcription _PROTEIN_ and the nubg coding sequence of vector padsl nx . the yeast resident _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ protein fused to nubg was used as a negative control . coexpression of the bait proteins with prey protein nubg should not result in an interaction and therefore not in activation of the system as it is not involved in the pathways of interest . as a positive control the protein was fused to the wild type ubiquitin domain . in contrast to the mutant the wild type n terminal ubiquitin domain can readily interact with the c terminal ubiquitin domain . thus the coexpression of the bait containing cub with a prey fused to nubi will lead to an interaction and therefore may be used to test for bait _PROTEIN_ and accessibility without the need for the fused proteins to interact . interactions were quantified by colonies spotted on synthetic dextrose medium containing the appropriate concentration of ammonium triazole as reported by citation and grown at for d after which the number of spots grown was scored . the bait was also screened using the inhibitor in the selection medium to rule out autoactivation . detection of galactosidase activity was performed with the filter lift assay . all experiments have been performed in quadruplicate for independent biological replicates . having two different auxotrophic markers for selection increased the reliability of the system in that the prey had to circumvent two different pathways to autoactivate the system as well as a colorimetric marker . the full length cdnas of the _PROTEIN_ genes were generated through phusion dna polymerase with suitable primers . coding sequences of the _PROTEIN_ were cloned into the gateway compatible destination vectors pbifc and pbifc plasmids regulated by the constitutive promoter . the n terminal and c terminal fragments of _METHOD_ were both fused to the n terminus of the coding sequences of the _PROTEIN_ . as a positive control the aquaporin _PROTEIN_ was used as aquaporins are known to form homotetramers in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . as a negative control the _PROTEIN_ chimera was coexpressed with the corresponding _PROTEIN_ constructs . the bifc screen was used to analyze in planta the interaction between the different _PROTEIN_ proteins . all possible combinations between the three primary and three secondary _PROTEIN_ were analyzed with this method _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . these interactions were also tested in the reverse combination with both the c and n termini of the _METHOD_ . leaves of week old tobacco plants were infiltrated following transformation with agrobacterium tumefaciens strain by transient coexpression of the desired protein pairs . _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was detected d after infiltration using the nm laser line of a _PROTEIN_ confocal laser scanning microscope equipped with an argon laser . to check the _METHOD_ reconstitution spectral analysis was performed with the nm laser line . all experiments were carried out in triplicate . using the same full length cdna genes previously indicated the coding sequence for each _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was amplified using phusion dna polymerase with primers suitable for the gateway _PROTEIN_ cloning reaction . these were inserted into through a _PROTEIN_ reaction . _PROTEIN_ was amplified with phusion dna polymerase an adenine overhang added through min of incubation with taq polymerase at and inserted into the topo vector from invitrogen . all three pdonr vectors were inserted into destination vectors carrying the kb upstream promoter region of each of the primary _PROTEIN_ and the coding sequence from _METHOD_ immediately prior to the attr recombination sites . the final vectors were sequenced over the entire length of their _PROTEIN_ coding region to confirm that no point mutations were present and to confirm that the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion was in frame . these constructs were made with n terminal _METHOD_ fusions as well as untagged versions of the constructs . this resulted in two sets of nine constructs that were termed px g cy for the fusion of the promoter for _PROTEIN_ x to the _METHOD_ fused coding sequence of _PROTEIN_ y and px cy for the untagged constructs to designate the promoter driving the coding sequence in each construct . _PROTEIN_ promoter constructs were transformed into the temperature sensitive _PROTEIN_ mutant _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ promoter constructs were transformed into the weak _PROTEIN_ mutant and _PROTEIN_ promoter constructs were transformed into the _PROTEIN_ null line prc through the floral dip method . these constructs and lines are illustrated in figure . fourteen transgenic g and g lines were identified by genotyping . ten lines from each type of transformant were investigated for the presence of _METHOD_ with seven g lines and g lines having visible _METHOD_ . two lines of each were selected for further in depth analysis . we identified transgenic lines for each construct by genotyping all were investigated for _METHOD_ with only a few lines found to display weak _METHOD_ for each construct . the _PROTEIN_ promoter was amplified using the primers indicated in supplemental table . the amplified _PROTEIN_ promoter was inserted into topo . sequence confirmed was digested using smai/xbai and inserted into vector to replace the promoter . the full length cdnas of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were pcr amplified and cloned into pdonr zeo using the primers listed in supplemental table . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were then inserted to destination vectors containing the kb _PROTEIN_ promoter using lr clonase ii . the identification of secondary cesa knockout lines from the signal collection was based on a combination of database searches and pcr amplification of t dna flanking regions . for t dna lines identified from the signal collection seeds were obtained from the arabidopsis biological resource center . pcr was carried out to identify single plants for the t dna insertion . primers used for t dna genotyping of _PROTEIN_ alleles are listed in supplemental table . the secondary cesa arabidopsis homozygous mutants used in this study included _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . arabidopsis ecotype columbia seeds and various mutant lines were sterilized and germinated on murashige and skoog _METHOD_ plates _METHOD_ . seedlings were then grown vertically on the agar at under continuous light for d before being transferred to pots in a greenhouse at under a h h dark cycle . total rna was isolated from arabidopsis seedlings using the rnaeasy mini kit . rt and pcr amplification were performed . for _METHOD_ amplification cycles of pcr amplification were performed using the primers shown below . as pcr amplification and loading controls the same template cdna was amplified using primers for the constitutive _PROTEIN_ gene . the primers used for rt pcr analysis were as follows _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ tacagctcgtccatgccgtga _PROTEIN_ ttagaaacattttctgtgaac . rosette leaves or _METHOD_ were harvested and ground in liquid nitrogen . after overnight extraction in ethanol at in a water bath tissues were exchanged with acetone . dry cell wall materials were ball milled to a fine powder . cellulose was measured as described by citation . data were collected from five technical replicates for each tissue sample . experiments were repeated twice . _METHOD_ from arabidopsis were hand cut by a razor blade and stained in toluidine blue o as described previously . stem sections were rinsed mounted in water and viewed with a compound microscope . around five individual plants were examined for each line . for analyses of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ proteins _PROTEIN_ in the promoter swap lines seeds were germinated on _METHOD_ agar plates and grown vertically in darkness for d at . seedlings were mounted between two coverslips in water . imaging was performed on a yokogawa spinning disk system featuring the leica motorized microscope and a leica numerical aperture oil objective . _METHOD_ was excited at nm and a band pass filter was used for emission filtering . image analysis was performed using metamorph and imaris software . movies were collected on d without a consistent pattern _PROTEIN_ which lines were imaged first . movies were taken at ambient temperatures . on none of the d did the average recorded _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ control velocity exceed the velocity of the lines recorded on that day . the lower number of g movies compared with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ occurs because the weaker signal makes it more difficult to _PROTEIN_ the focal plane appropriately . an approximately equal number of acquisitions were attempted for each with poor focal quality movies discarded during postprocessing . image analysis was performed with imagej and imaris software . movies were first contrast enhanced in imagej and a walking average of four frames was taken using the kymograph plugin for imagej . these steps were performed to improve the accuracy of automated particle recognition performed in subsequent steps . these images were then opened in imaris and switched from z series to time series . the voxel size was set to nm per voxel based on measurements from the scope and the time interval was set to s. the particle recognition algorithm in imaris was performed with a spot size of nm . high intensity signal was filtered to eliminate _LOCATION_ signal . following this the connected components program was run which determines particle identity over several frames and converts a particle s movement into tracks . all tracks present for less than s were discarded . the displacement and duration of the remaining tracks were exported to a spreadsheet and their average velocity distribution of velocities and any directional bias were calculated . the following materials are available in the online version of this article . supplemental figure . rescues from secondary swap constructs without n terminal _METHOD_ fusion .
