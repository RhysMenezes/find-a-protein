encodes an e subclass pentatricopeptide repeat _PROTEIN_ protein in arabidopsis thaliana . _PROTEIN_ is an editing _PROTEIN_ targeted to mitochondria _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ specifically addresses one of two contiguous rna editing sites in the _PROTEIN_ transcript . two adjacent rna editing sites must be recognized by at least two different editing _PROTEIN_ . lack of editing in _PROTEIN_ mutants changes a conserved amino acid in nadh dehydrogenase subunit .
to identify specific trans _PROTEIN_ involved in rna editing of plant mitochondrial transcripts we selected _PROTEIN_ candidate genes based on four criteria _PROTEIN_ genes with ests or cdna sequences in public databases mitochondrial destination predicted by different subcellular sorting _METHOD_ members of the _PROTEIN_ subfamily with e e or dyw motifs low sequence similarity with other arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ proteins . one of the _PROTEIN_ genes thus selected is which encodes an e _PROTEIN_ protein . to test the prediction that the protein translated from this gene is targeted to mitochondria a dna fragment encoding the n terminal amino acids _PROTEIN_ was fused upstream of the _METHOD_ gene and stable transgenic arabidopsis lines were generated . in leaf protoplasts and seedling roots from these transgenic lines _METHOD_ _METHOD_ showed the punctuate pattern characteristic of mitochondria . furthermore _METHOD_ and mitotracker orange _METHOD_ overlapped and were clearly distinct from chloroplast _METHOD_ confirming that the _PROTEIN_ protein is targeted to mitochondria and not to chloroplasts . to characterize _PROTEIN_ gene _PROTEIN_ we fused either or bp fragments from just upstream of the _PROTEIN_ aug codon to a gus reporter gene . transgenic lines for both constructs showed similar _PROTEIN_ patterns suggesting that the _PROTEIN_ promoter activity is located within bp upstream of the _PROTEIN_ aug start codon . gus activity was detected in cotyledons and hypocotyls of seedlings in leaves and in sepals filaments and the pistil of flowers . with the mitochondrial localization of _PROTEIN_ confirmed we analyzed the rna editing phenotypes in disrupted mutants . two independent mutants were retrieved from the salk and sail collections homozygous plants were selected and the positions of both independent t dna insertions were confirmed by pcr and sequencing to be in the coding region . for the identification of mitochondrial rna editing defects in the mutants rna from leaves was screened for deficiencies in rna editing with the multiplexed snapshot approach . with this assay annotated editing sites were analyzed in addition further mitochondrial editing sites were examined by direct rt pcr amplification and sequencing . in this analysis we found a defect in editing at one of the editing events in the _PROTEIN_ transcript site _PROTEIN_ is not edited in both mutants . surprisingly the immediately adjacent site _PROTEIN_ is completely edited in both wild type and mutant plants suggesting that nucleotides and are recognized by different _PROTEIN_ . when we analyzed the _PROTEIN_ rna editing status by rt pcr we found that among mutant cdna clones all were unedited at _PROTEIN_ and edited at _PROTEIN_ . in contrast among wild type cdna clones all were edited at _PROTEIN_ and were also edited at _PROTEIN_ . when normally edited at positions and the ccg codon is changed to uug codon . the leucine amino acid is highly conserved in plants . in both mutants the ccg codon is edited to cug encoding serine . the gene locus _PROTEIN_ was renamed _PROTEIN_ and the mutant lines _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ respectively . when the mutants were compared to wild type plants no changes were seen in the macroscopic phenotype or in the development of homozygous _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ plants under standard growth conditions . neither was pollen viability affected . these results suggest that the lack of editing at site _PROTEIN_ has little effect on normal mitochondrial function . rna processing of the _PROTEIN_ precursor to the mature transcript includes cis and trans splicing and rna editing events . to evaluate if the lack of rna editing at the _PROTEIN_ site alters other rna processing steps in the _PROTEIN_ transcript we assayed an rna gel blot with a probe specific for the _PROTEIN_ transcript . no difference in the _PROTEIN_ transcript profiles was seen in leaves of wild type and _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutant plants suggesting that stability splicing and or processing are not affected . this result also precludes that the molecular phenotype of the loss of rna editing at site _PROTEIN_ is a secondary effect generated by defects in transcription or processing .
the wild type arabidopsis thaliana ecotype used was columbia . the t dna insertion mutant lines sail _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in the col background were obtained from the _PROTEIN_ stock center . seeds were sown on half concentrated murashige and skoog medium supplemented with sucrose and solidified with agar . after weeks in a h day/night cycle at seedlings were transferred to soil and grown for weeks under the same conditions . to isolate homozygous mutant plants genotyping was performed by pcr as described using the specific primers indicated in . growth and phenotype of wild type and _PROTEIN_ mutant plants were analyzed at the seedling stage and in adult plants . alexander staining of pollen was performed on anthers of recently opened flowers as described . to characterize _PROTEIN_ transcripts in wild type and _PROTEIN_ mutant plants total rna was isolated from leaves of six week old plants or days old seedlings with the _PROTEIN_ reagent following the manufacturer s protocol . northern blot analyses were performed as described using a _PROTEIN_ p labeled probe . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ homozygous mutant plants were screened by multiplexed single base extension snapshot analysis for altered rna editing at specific sites . to confirm the editing defect observed specific cdna fragments were generated by rt pcr amplification using primer _PROTEIN_ for cdna synthesis and primers _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ for pcr amplification . the status of the respective editing site was determined by sequence analysis . the cdna sequences were compared for c to t differences resulting from rna editing . _PROTEIN_ localization was investigated by _METHOD_ fusion to the _PROTEIN_ amino terminal amino acids in vector . the dna encoding this amino terminal sequence was obtained by pcr with primers amino _PROTEIN_ and amino _PROTEIN_ . to construct gus promoter fusions two pcr fragments of and bp from upstream of the _PROTEIN_ initiation codon were cloned into the pgem t easy plasmid digested with sal i and nco i and ligated to the gus frame in . primers were _PROTEIN_ salif and ncoir for the kb dna fragment and _PROTEIN_ salif and ncoir for the kb fragment . constructs were verified by dna sequencing introduced into agrobacterium tumefaciens by electroporation and arabidopsis plants were transformed by floral dip . several independent transgenic lines were obtained for each construct . _METHOD_ and mitotracker orange _METHOD_ were analyzed with a confocal microscope _PROTEIN_ in seedling roots and protoplasts prepared as described . histochemical gus staining was performed as described .
