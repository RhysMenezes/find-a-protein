light is an important environmental information source that plants use to modify their growth and development . palisade parenchyma cells in leaves develop cylindrical shapes in response to blue light however the photosensory mechanism for this response has not been elucidated . in this study we analyzed the palisade cell response in phototropin deficient mutants . first we found that two different light sensing _METHOD_ contributed to the response in different proportions depending on the light intensity . one response observed under lower intensities of blue light was mediated exclusively by a blue light photoreceptor phototropin _PROTEIN_ . another response was elicited under higher intensities of light in a phototropin independent manner . to determine the tissue in which _PROTEIN_ perceives the light stimulus to regulate the response green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ under the control of tissue specific promoters in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutant background . the results revealed that the _PROTEIN_ of in the mesophyll but not in the epidermis promoted palisade cell development . furthermore a constitutively active c terminal kinase fragment of _PROTEIN_ fused to _METHOD_ promoted the development of cylindrical palisade cells in the proper direction without the directional cue provided by light . hence in response to blue light _PROTEIN_ promotes the development of cylindrical palisade cells along a predetermined axis in a tissue autonomous manner .
it has previously been reported that cylindrical palisade cells develop in response to blue but not red light . first we confirmed those reports under monochromatic lights with different intensities from to . transverse sections were prepared from the fourth leaves of wild type arabidopsis seedlings grown under blue light for d or under red light for d . as expected cylindrical cells were observed in the subepidermal palisade layer in leaves grown under blue light but not in leaves grown under red light . we then determined cell heights in the anticlinal direction and cell widths in the periclinal direction on the sections . in red light statistically significant increases in both cell height and width were observed with increasing light intensity up to . by contrast blue light increased cell height but not cell width up to . to compare the cell slenderness under different light conditions the height to width ratios were calculated . cell slenderness increased with increasing the blue light intensity whereas cells remained almost spherical in red light up to . similarly the cell slenderness was increased under strong white light . although the effect was not clear in very young leaves the cells became more slender as they developed . two phototropins _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ function redundantly in arabidopsis . we therefore examined the response in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant under the same light conditions . the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ palisade cells remained spherical even under blue or white light indicating that phototropins almost exclusively mediated the response under these conditions . furthermore cell slenderness was increased even in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ under blue light ranging from to . no palisade cell response was observed under monochromatic blue light at . hence the observed response appeared to be less sensitive than other phototropin mediated responses such as phototropism chloroplast avoidance movement and stomatal opening . to further investigate this phenomenon we compared the effects of lower intensities of blue light combined with background red light . the response under blue light in the presence of red light was indistinguishable from that under monochromatic blue light . even blue light in combination with red light was partially effective in eliciting the response . hence the development of slender cells may require not only phototropin activation but also a certain amount of light to sustain cell growth . _PROTEIN_ is usually more sensitive to light than _PROTEIN_ . we therefore examined the palisade cell response in the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ single mutants . the response was substantially reduced in the _PROTEIN_ mutant whereas the _PROTEIN_ mutant showed an almost normal response . these results indicated that the blue light dependent development of cylindrical palisade cells was mediated principally by _PROTEIN_ . some responses mediated by _PROTEIN_ such as the chloroplast avoidance response are clearly less sensitive than the present response . however the chloroplast accumulation response mediated by _PROTEIN_ is elicited by only blue light . hence the blue light sensitivity of the palisade cell response was relatively high but within the range of known _PROTEIN_ mediated responses . the levels of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ can be affected by light conditions . hence we examined the levels of both proteins by immunoblotting . the _PROTEIN_ level in the fourth leaves was substantially reduced under blue light whereas the level remained relatively high under blue light . as expected _PROTEIN_ was more stable under monochromatic red light at either or . interestingly the level was substantially reduced under light indicating that blue and red lights synergistically reduced the level of _PROTEIN_ . in contrast with _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ level has been reported not to be affected by blue light . however it was reduced to some extent under both _PROTEIN_ and conditions compared with _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ promoter is active in most leaf tissues including the mesophyll and epidermis . to elucidate the photoperceptive site within the leaf for the palisade cell response we developed the transgenic plants that _PROTEIN_ under the control of the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ promoters which have been used for mesophyll specific _PROTEIN_ and epidermis specific _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ of exogenous proteins . as a control the gene was _PROTEIN_ under the control of the native _PROTEIN_ promoter . each of these three fusion constructs was transformed into the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant to establish lines named and respectively . immunoblot analysis with anti _PROTEIN_ polyclonal antibody revealed that the protein was _PROTEIN_ at the predicted size in all the lines . we then examined the tissue specific _PROTEIN_ of under a confocal laser scanning microscope . as expected _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was detected only in the mesophyll and epidermis in and plants respectively . by contrast the _METHOD_ was observed in both tissues in the plants . to validate the tissue specific _PROTEIN_ of the above lines functionally we examined the chloroplast avoidance response which is known to be regulated by _PROTEIN_ in a cell autonomous manner . under blue light chloroplasts avoided the light and accumulated at the anticlinal sides of the cells in wild type _PROTEIN_ and plants as previously reported . as expected the same response was observed in plants whereas chloroplasts stayed at the tops of the cells in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and plants . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ redundantly regulate the leaf flattening response . accordingly curled leaves were observed in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . in contrast with the chloroplast avoidance response but not complemented this phenotype . namely the plants had curled leaves even under blue light . in the epidermis but not in the mesophyll therefore restored the leaf flattening response . taken together this evidence showed that was _PROTEIN_ in the target tissues . we then examined the palisade cell development in the above lines under different light conditions . as expected no response was observed under red light in all the lines . importantly cylindrical palisade cells were observed under light in the plants but not in the plants . hence the mesophyll was demonstrated to be the photoperceptive site for this response . to examine whether _PROTEIN_ was distributed along the developmental axis in palisade cells we observed the _METHOD_ in plants . in the transverse sections of leaves the _METHOD_ was uniformly detected in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ region _PROTEIN_ of light conditions . hence no correlation was observed between intracellular distribution and the directional development of the cells . we further examined the possibility that incident light acted as a directional cue for the development of cylindrical cells with the aid of the transgenic plants . in this line _PROTEIN_ mediated physiological responses such as stomatal opening and chloroplast avoidance are induced without light stimulus due to constitutive _PROTEIN_ of the fragment . the plants were grown under red light or light and subjected to the anatomical analyses . cylindrical palisade cells were found to have developed even in red light . furthermore those cylindrical cells were oriented perpendicular to the leaf surface . the slenderness values were the same in the two light conditions . since the fragment lacks the photosensory n terminal lov domains we conclude that the direction of the development of cylindrical cells is determined independent of the direction of incident light . we also examined the intracellular distribution of in the plants . the localization of was uniformly detected to be in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ region in palisade cells as is the case with though the _PROTEIN_ level was much lower in the plants . hence we confirmed that the phototropin localization in the cells was not directly related to the determination of the developmental axis . _PROTEIN_ promotes chloroplast accumulation at the anticlinal side of palisade cells under relatively strong blue light . this avoidance response is constitutively induced in the cells . therefore we thought that the development of cylindrical cells might be a direct consequence of the position adopted by chloroplasts to avoid light . to test this possibility we examined the palisade cell development in the chloroplast positioning mutants j domain protein required for chloroplast accumulation _PROTEIN_ and chloroplast unusual _PROTEIN_ . we first confirmed that the chloroplast light avoidance response was induced under . for this experiment wild type plants carrying the mutation were used because the other mutants examined here were all in the mutant background . consequently plants but not _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plants exhibited the response . as reported previously avoidance like distribution of chloroplasts was observed in _PROTEIN_ under both red light and light . nevertheless cylindrical palisade cells were observed only under light . hence accumulation of chloroplasts at the anticlinal side of the palisade cells did not necessarily induce the development of cylindrical cells . in _PROTEIN_ plants chloroplasts aggregated at the _METHOD_ or anticlinal sides of the cells depending on the light conditions . despite this abnormal chloroplast positioning cylindrical palisade cells developed normally in . taken together this evidence shows that the development of cylindrical cells was independent of the position of the chloroplasts . it has previously been reported that non phototropic _PROTEIN_ and phytochrome kinase _PROTEIN_ family proteins function in the phototropic and leaf flattening responses downstream of phototropins . to address whether those _PROTEIN_ are involved in the palisade cell response the palisade cells of the _PROTEIN_ single _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ triple and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ quadruple mutants were observed . the measurement of palisade cell sizes revealed that these mutants normally developed cylindrical palisade cells under light . the above mentioned _PROTEIN_ were therefore not involved in the palisade cell response . the blue light photoreceptor _PROTEIN_ was found to promote the development of cylindrical palisade cells in a tissue autonomous manner . however the molecular mechanism for this response remains unclear . phototropism is caused by the differential cell growth between the lit and shaded sides of a cell or tissue . nevertheless _PROTEIN_ such as _PROTEIN_ and pks proteins which were involved in phototropism were not required for the present response . hence _PROTEIN_ might regulate the palisade cell growth by a different mechanism . in this respect it will be worth testing whether the plant hormone auxin which is known to be involved in phototropism participates in this response .
arabidopsis thaliana mutants and transgenic plants were used in this study . the columbia accession was used as the wild type . the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutant plants were crossed with the wild type to obtain respective mutants in the wild type background . the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutants are in the columbia background . the plants are in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ background . the seeds were sown on rockwool moistened with hyponex solution and kept at in darkness for d . the seedlings were then placed under continuous white light from _METHOD_ tubes at and grown for d before the light treatments . plants were then treated with monochromatic red and/or blue light from light emitting diodes _PROTEIN_ to observe light responses . leaves were numbered from the first rosette leaf that emerged after the cotyledons . after the light treatment the blades of the fourth rosette leaves were detached from the plants and fixed overnight in formaldehyde acetic acid solution at . to determine the cell sizes and chloroplast positions leaf samples were dehydrated in an ethanol series on ice . the ethanol was then replaced with propylene oxide in an ethanol/propylene oxide series at room temperature . finally the samples were embedded in spurr s resin from which _PROTEIN_ sections were sliced with a glass knife on an ultramicrotome . the sections were stained with toluidine blue solution before observation under a microscope . seven to subepidermal palisade cells inside a small central region of either the right or left half of the leaf blade were observed . the cell height in the anticlinal direction and the cell width in the periclinal direction were determined in the sections with the aid of imagej image analysis software _PROTEIN_ . for conventional observation of the leaves fixed leaves were dehydrated with ethanol on ice and immediately embedded in technovit resin . ten micrometer _PROTEIN_ sections were slicedwith a disposable blade on a microtome and then stained with toluidine blue solution before observation under a microscope . because the rates of growth and the final sizes of leaves varied substantially depending on the light conditions the fourth leaves were collected after different durations of the monochromatic light treatment after d in blue light d in red light and between and d in combined blue and red lights . full length _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ cdna was cut from the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ vector

transverse observation leaves were sliced with vibratome sectioning as described previously . green _METHOD_ from _METHOD_ was observed with a to nm filter set with nm excitation and red _METHOD_ from chlorophyll was observed with a > nm cutoff filter with nm excitation . the images were false colored to reflect actual colors of _METHOD_ and chlorophyll _METHOD_ were then overlaid electronically . immunoblot analysis was performed essentially as described previously . fifty _METHOD_ of total crude proteins were prepared from the leaf blades of plants grown under or white light for indicated periods and then subjected to _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . the blots were probed with anti _PROTEIN_ and anti _PROTEIN_ polyclonal antibodies . to examine the avoidance response plants grown under a h h night cycle for weeks were _PROTEIN_ in darkness at for h before being treated with blue light for h. chloroplast distribution was observed under a laser scanning microscope in subepidermal palisade cells of the fourth leaves essentially as described previously . the leaf flattening response was observed in the fourth leaves collected from plants that were treated with light for d or with monochromatic red light at for d. the leaves were embedded in low melting point agarose to prepare transverse sections with a razor blade across the approximate center of the leaf blade . photographs of the sections were taken with a stereomicroscope and measured with imagej _PROTEIN_ . the ratio of the straight line distance between the two edges of the leaf to the actual leaf width along the curved surface was then determined . photosynthetic _PROTEIN_ fixation was determined essentially as described . gas exchange was measured in the fifth leaves under dark and white light conditions .
