n glycosylation is very common in integral _LOCATION_ proteins of the animal lysosome but it is very rare in arabidopsis tonoplast proteins indicating divergent evolution of the lysosomal and _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ .
to obtain an overview on the putative n glycosylation status of arabidopsis _LOCATION_ proteins in silico analysis was performed searching for n glycosylated _LOCATION_ proteins and their subcellular distribution . published proteomics data on the arabidopsis _LOCATION_ or tonoplast were first compared . ninety five sequences that had been assigned to the tonoplast in all these studies were selected . to enrich our tmp database a search for proteins annotated as tonoplast was performed in the tair database integral _LOCATION_ proteins were extracted from the resulting list using the bulk protein search tool and if not already present they were added to our database . finally proteins for which there is published experimental evidence for a localization other than the tonoplast were discarded . in total we thus identified integral tonoplast proteins . a search and selection using the same criteria was performed on arabidopsis _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ proteins _PROTEIN_ . proteomic analysis by et al . reported putative _PROTEIN_ . this study was chosen because it contains the highest number of identified polypeptides . integral _LOCATION_ proteins annotated as _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ were also extracted from the tair protein database . when the two lists were combined proteins that were experimentally verified to be not at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ were discarded and only integral _LOCATION_ proteins were considered proteins were thus selected . putative sequon positions in the selected proteins were predicted by a bioinformatics procedure that combined the analysis of transmembrane protein topology by the tmhmm or phobius software and the search for putative n glycosylation sites by the netnglyc software . the following further limitations were considered . amino acids located in _LOCATION_ or transmembrane regions can not come into contact with the oligosaccharyltransferase and therefore can not be glycosylated . moreover close proximity to transmembrane domains or the n terminal signal peptide inhibits glycosylation because of steric effects mutagenesis indicated that to be glycosylated the luminal sequon must be at minimal distances of and residues after the end and before the beginning of a transmembrane segment respectively . consistently the single luminal sequon of the tonoplast tandem pore potassium channel _PROTEIN_ that immediately precedes the second transmembrane helix is not glycosylated in vivo . n glycosylation sites that did not meet these requirements were excluded . analysis using the tmhmm algorithm indicated that only out of the tmps can be glycosylated representing of the tonoplast proteome and having in total sequons . the phobius algorithm was more selective sequences were validated with sequons _METHOD_ . putative n glycosylated integral tonoplast proteins of arabidopsis thaliana identified using netglyc and tmhmm _METHOD_ among the integral proteins of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ polypeptides representing of the total contain sequons that satisfy the criteria described above for n glycosylation when analyzed by the tmhmm algorithm _PROTEIN_ . also in this case the phobius algorithm is more stringent identifying putative n glycosylated _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis for a total of sequons . putative n glycosylated integral _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ proteins _PROTEIN_ of arabidopsis thaliana identified using netglyc and tmhmm _METHOD_ these data indicate that a much lower fraction of the tonoplast than the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ proteome may be n glycosylated and that glycoproteins with more than two sequons are rare in the tonoplast but very frequent in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . this suggests an enrichment of n glycans on the cell surface and a selective depletion on the tonoplast . the n glycoproteome is under represented in the arabidopsis tonoplast . percentage of polypeptides containing sequons that satisfy the requirements for n glycosylation in the proteomes of the arabidopsis tonoplast or _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and of the rat lysosomal or _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . distribution of sequons per protein in the four n glycoproteomes illustrated in . the tmhmm algorithm was used to define transmembrane domains and protein topology . as mentioned in the introduction _LOCATION_ and lysosomes share a number of features and functions . we thus wondered whether the observations we made _PROTEIN_ arabidopsis can be extended to a model animal . the recently described rat liver lysosomal proteome was first analyzed searching for putative lmps . we thus excluded the proteins with detailed localization c cytoplasm cs _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ g _LOCATION_ eg _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ m mitochondria p _LOCATION_ n _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ mitochondria _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ pm _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . the remaining sequences were then scanned through our pipeline in order to identify n glycosylated lmps . seventy three putative lmps that can be n glycosylated were identified for a total of sequons these represent of the entire lysosomal _LOCATION_ proteome . using the phobius algorithm n glycosylated lmps were identified for a total of sequons . it can be concluded that the relative abundance of putative n glycoproteins in the lysosomal _LOCATION_ is three times greater than in the tonoplast . in this respect the lysosomal _LOCATION_ resembles the arabidopsis _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ more than the tonoplast a feature confirmed when the distribution of sequons per glycoprotein is analyzed . these results mark a major perhaps unsuspected difference between the _LOCATION_ and lysosomal _LOCATION_ . we then verified whether there is any marked difference in the abundance of n glycosylation between the lysosomal and _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ proteomes in rat liver cells . proteomic analysis by et al . listed _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ among which have at least one putative transmembrane domain . we have further refined the list of putative integral _PROTEIN_ using the _PROTEIN_ gene ontology classification system we have selected genes that are classified as _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and excluded those classified as _LOCATION_ mitochondria or lysosome . this analysis restricted the number of rat _PROTEIN_ to here reported in supplementary table . among this group of proteins can be n glycosylated for a total of sequons identified using the tmhmm algorithm thus representing of the total . when the phobius algorithm was used putative n glycosylated proteins with sequons were identified . the ratio between the percentages of putative n glycosylated proteins in the rat _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and the lysosomal _LOCATION_ is therefore compared with the ratio between the arabidopsis _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and tonoplast . the distribution of the number of sequons per polypeptide _METHOD_ that there is not a marked difference in n glycosylation patterns between the two rat _LOCATION_ unlike what we observed in arabidopsis . therefore the low presence of n glycosylation sites in the _LOCATION_ proteins of the hydrolytic subcellular compartment relative to those of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ is a feature of the model plant not reflected in the model animal . to obtain further experimental support for the bioinformatics results biochemical analysis of the n glycosylation status of proteins in the different arabidopsis _LOCATION_ was performed . _LOCATION_ were isolated from protoplasts released by digestion of arabidopsis rosette leaves . microsomes were then prepared either from the purified _LOCATION_ fraction or from whole protoplasts and were treated with to release peripheral _LOCATION_ proteins . microsomes from the _LOCATION_ fraction should thus be constituted by the tonoplast whereas those from whole protoplasts should contain all _LOCATION_ of the cell . protein blots using antibodies against the tonoplast marker _PROTEIN_ or the _LOCATION_ markers bip and showed that in the stripped _LOCATION_ microsomes _PROTEIN_ was highly enriched whereas the _LOCATION_ markers were below our limit of detection . conversely the two _LOCATION_ residents were clearly detected in the protoplast microsomal preparation . the tonoplast fraction was therefore only negligibly contaminated by _LOCATION_ originating from the major compartment of the endomembrane system . to detect the occurrence of n glycans on tmps protein blot was performed by incubation with cona conjugated to peroxidase . cona binds terminal d mannosyl and d _PROTEIN_ residues _PROTEIN_ occurring in high mannose unmodified n glycans . very few polypeptides were recognized by cona in the tonoplast compared with those recognized in total microsomes . this may indicate that very few tmps are n glycosylated or that the vast majority of tmp n glycans are modified during traffic through the _LOCATION_ apparatus . to investigate these two possibilities tonoplast microsomes were tested for the presence of modified n glycans using an anti cgly antiserum specific for linked xylose a residue present in all cgly detectable in the arabidopsis proteome . consistently protein blot of arabidopsis total leaf homogenates showed that no polypeptide was recognized by anti cgly in knockout plants totally deficient in _LOCATION_ xylosyl and fucosyltransferase activities _PROTEIN_ but many polypeptides were detected in wild type plant extracts . the antiserum was therefore used to _PROTEIN_ subcellular fractions of wild type protoplasts and _LOCATION_ . in both protoplasts and _LOCATION_ the vast majority of polypeptides recognized by the anti cgly antiserum were in the soluble fraction strongly suggesting that most intracellular glycoproteins with cgly are soluble proteins of the _LOCATION_ lumen . a small number of microsomal proteins from protoplasts also reacted with the antiserum . some of these were possibly minor contaminations from abundant soluble proteins but others were relatively enriched in the stripped microsomes . the patterns were very similar when microsomes were not stripped . microsomes isolated from _LOCATION_ did not give any signal indicating that cgly are either absent or present in a very minor proportion in the tonoplast proteome . even when an equal amount of protein was analyzed for each subcellular fraction and _LOCATION_ were not stripped the signal given by the tonoplast preparation was very low compared with that of protoplast microsomes . the tonoplast preparation is not contaminated by _LOCATION_ microsomes . protoplasts from arabidopsis leaves were used to isolate _LOCATION_ . the isolated _LOCATION_ or protoplast preparations were then separated into microsomal and soluble fractions in the presence or absence of . equal amounts of protein were analyzed by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and protein blot using antisera against _PROTEIN_ bip or . the vertical lines separate lanes rearranged from different parts of a single blot exposure . numbers on the left indicate the positions of molecular _METHOD_ markers in kda . n glycosylated proteins with high mannose oligosaccharide chains are much less abundant in the tonoplast than in the total _LOCATION_ fraction . microsomal fractions from arabidopsis protoplasts or purified _LOCATION_ were analyzed by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and protein blot followed by incubation with concanavalin a conjugated to peroxidase . numbers on the left indicate the positions of molecular _METHOD_ markers in kda . the cgly serum does not detect polypeptides in the tonoplast preparation . in each panel analysis was by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and protein blot using anti cgly serum . total proteins were extracted from leaves of wild type or _PROTEIN_ /fuct arabidopsis . equal amounts of protein were analyzed . soluble and microsomal fractions were prepared from _LOCATION_ or protoplasts in the presence or absence of . an equal proportion of each fraction or a fold dilution of each total unfractionated sample was analyzed . as in but an equal amount of protein was analyzed for each fraction . in each panel numbers on the left indicate the positions of molecular _METHOD_ markers in kda . taken together the cona binding and anti cgly assays confirm our in silico results indicating a low frequency of n glycosylated proteins in the tonoplast proteome . to obtain more detailed information on the subcellular localization of the microsomal proteins with cgly microsomes prepared from arabidopsis leaf protoplasts were fractionated on isopycnic sucrose gradients . an intense peak of anti cgly reactivity was coincident with the migration of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ marker _PROTEIN_ and a minor peak in very light _LOCATION_ fractions . in agreement with the results shown in no peak was detected in the fractions containing the tonoplast marker _PROTEIN_ . when _LOCATION_ were treated with the general distribution of polypeptides recognized by anti cgly along the gradient did not change markedly . analysis was also performed by microscopy . the tonoplast can be visualized by _METHOD_ microscopy on fixed and permeabilized plant cells using antisera against specific resident _LOCATION_ proteins . however anti cgly _PROTEIN_ decorated the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and in part small circular subcellular structures but almost no signal was present at the tonoplast . subcellular fractionation and microscopy therefore confirmed that the tonoplast is specifically depleted of cgly and indicated that most cgly are at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . most _LOCATION_ proteins with complex glycans are in a microsomal fraction with higher density than the tonoplast . microsomes were prepared from arabidopsis leaves in the absence or presence of and subjected to isopycnic sucrose gradient centrifugation . analysis of each gradient fraction was by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and protein blot using anti cgly anti _PROTEIN_ or anti sera . numbers at the top indicate the fraction density . in each panel numbers on the left indicate the positions of molecular _METHOD_ markers in kda . the majority of _LOCATION_ proteins with complex glycans are in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . protoplasts isolated from arabidopsis cultured cells were fixed permeabilized and analyzed by _METHOD_ microscopy using anti cgly antibody and alexafluor goat anti rabbit secondary antibody . as control the anti cgly antibody was omitted and incubation was only performed with alexafluor goat anti rabbit secondary antibody . six

rabbit or anti _PROTEIN_ igg peroxidase conjugate for detection of proteins with high mannose n glycans the protein blot was incubated with ml concanavalin a peroxidase conjugate in phosphate buffered saline _PROTEIN_ containing tween and for at according to the manufacturer s protocols . peroxidase activity can be detected using super west pico according to the manufacturer s protocol . protein molecular weight markers were used as _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ molecular _METHOD_ markers . for total protein extraction from wild type or _PROTEIN_ knockout plants arabidopsis leaves were homogenized in
