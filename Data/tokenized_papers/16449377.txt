the arabidopsis thaliana genome contains cyclic nucleotide gated channel _PROTEIN_ genes encoding putative non selective ion channels . classical and reverse genetic approaches have revealed that two members of this family _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ play a role in plant defence responses whereas _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ may participate in heavy metal and cation transport . yet it remains to be resolved how the ion transport attributes of _PROTEIN_ are integrated into their physiological function . in this study _PROTEIN_ is characterized through heterologous _PROTEIN_ gus and _METHOD_ reporter gene fusions and by adopting a reverse genetics approach . a _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein shows that it is _PROTEIN_ targeted to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . promoter gus studies demonstrate _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ predominantly in the cortical and epidermal root cells but also a ubiquitous presence in shoot tissues . _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in yeast indicates it can function as a na uptake and a k uptake mechanism . _PROTEIN_ null mutations _PROTEIN_ seed germination in the presence of nacl but not kcl . relative to the wild type mutant seedling growth is more resistant to the presence of toxic concentrations of nacl and kcl . the ionic composition and ion uptake characteristics of wild type and mutant seedlings suggests that the growth advantage in these conditions may be due to restricted ion influx in mutant plants and that _PROTEIN_ functions in the non selective uptake of monovalent cations in arabidopsis root tissue .
three independent _PROTEIN_ insertion mutants lines and _PROTEIN_ were derived from the salk institute . lines and carry insertions in the and exon respectively at approximately and bp of the genomic sequence of _GENE_ . on the basis of kanamycin segregation all three lines appeared to contain a single t dna insert . rt pcr analysis showed none of the three lines _PROTEIN_ full length _PROTEIN_ transcript . when _PROTEIN_ seeds were placed on plates or suspended in growth medium containing increasing concentrations of monovalent salts germination rates were progressively lower . however there were clear distinctions between mutant and wild type seed germination . for all three independent lines germination in the presence of mm nacl was significantly lower than for the wild type . this effect was specific for nacl and did not occur with either comparable concentrations of kcl or . iso osmolar concentrations of sorbitol only had a relatively small impact on seed germination that was similar for wild type and mutant seeds . thus the data suggest _PROTEIN_ germination is not altered in its osmotic sensitivity but exhibits a specific sensitivity to toxicity of na but not k or \ in control growth conditions no or very little difference could be observed between growth characteristics of mutant and wild type plants . when plants were germinated on control plates and transferred to plates with increasing concentrations of monovalent salts no substantial differences in growth rates between mutant and wild type plants were observed in the presence of or licl . however mutant plants grew better when exposed to nacl stress but this difference was significant only at intermediate concentrations of nacl . in equimolar concentrations kcl produced comparable growth inhibition in arabidopsis to that observed with nacl . however the presence of high concentration of kcl which had no discernible effect on _PROTEIN_ germination inhibited wild type growth more than growth of mutant lines . the relative growth advantage of the mutant lines became more pronounced at high kcl concentrations . no significant differences in phenotype of _PROTEIN_ mutants and wild type plants were detected when plants were grown in media containing various amounts of low or high and mm sorbitol . mutant plants did not show altered phenotypes _PROTEIN_ their gravitropic response and in response to pathogens . the germination and growth data suggest that in planta _PROTEIN_ may be involved in uptake and/or translocation of alkali cations such as k and na . thus the lack of _PROTEIN_ function in the mutant lines may have an impact on homeostasis of these ions . tissue concentrations and net uptake were therefore determined for a number of different elements using inductively coupled _LOCATION_ optical emission _METHOD_ . since the three independent mutants showed similar phenotypes the subsequent analyses were carried out for lines and only . icp data revealed that wild type and _PROTEIN_ seedlings grown in control conditions contain similar levels of macro and micronutrients . growth for several days on high levels of kcl or nacl did not lead to any significant differences between mutant and wild type seedlings for na content . however these conditions did cause a significantly lower level of k accumulation in mutant lines where k content increased by about compared with wild type seedlings where k rose by around . these results suggest that mutant plants are more capable of preventing k accumulation . it was also tested whether short term uptake of na was altered in the mutants . when net uptake of na was measured over periods of h and h a consistently lower influx was observed in mutant lines compared to wild type plants . further uptake experiments during an intermediate period of h showed that this difference was no longer present . these data indicate that during the initial stages of salt stress _PROTEIN_ makes a considerable contribution to na influx but after prolonged periods net uptake fluxes not only diminish but also converge to similar values for wild type and mutant lines suggesting a limited participation of _PROTEIN_ in ion uptake in salinity _PROTEIN_ plants . the observed phenotype and icp data for _PROTEIN_ mutants suggest _PROTEIN_ involvement in monovalent cation transport . nevertheless altered responses to ionic stress can originate from many _PROTEIN_ and the loss of function in _PROTEIN_ may not affect ionic fluxes per se but could be due to related phenomena such as signalling _LOCATION_ potential homeostasis or osmotic adjustment . in order to establish whether _PROTEIN_ can function as an actual cation pathway and might therefore directly alter ion fluxes in planta the _PROTEIN_ gene was _PROTEIN_ in yeast strains that were defective in various aspects of cation transport . the yeast strain g carries deletions in the major na extruding pumps _PROTEIN_ thereby greatly enhancing its salt sensitivity . _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in this yeast background did not lead to any significant difference in growth between the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and empty vector _PROTEIN_ strains in control medium . however after a few h of growth it becomes apparent that a rise in nacl concentration in the medium to mm leads to a significant reduction in growth for the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ strain compared with the ev control . in addition ion contents analyses showed that the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ yeast accumulates significantly more na compared with the ev strain . the difference in cellular na content was already apparent after h and suggests that _PROTEIN_ functions as a na permeable uptake mechanism in these yeast cells . to assess _PROTEIN_ k permeability a k uptake deficient yeast deleted in the k transporters _PROTEIN_ and was used that requires k concentrations of around mm or higher for growth . whereas complementation of this strain with k channels such as _PROTEIN_ restores growth at micromolar external k _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in this yeast background leads to partial complementation only in the millimolar range of external k . in addition _PROTEIN_ results in increased k accumulation . combined the yeast _PROTEIN_ data suggest that _PROTEIN_ can function as a pathway for na and k transport . heterologous _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in a yeast strain that lacks high affinity uptake did not affect yeast growth characteristics . data concerning possible _PROTEIN_ substrates can give helpful clues towards putative roles of this transporter . in addition the physiological function of gene products is often associated with their location both at the cellular and subcellular level . the latter issue may be of particular relevance in providing a rationale for the existence of large gene families such as the _PROTEIN_ family . therefore _PROTEIN_ localization studies were carried out for _PROTEIN_ using gus promoter constructs and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion constructs . a kb upstream region of _PROTEIN_ was cloned from genomic dna using a pcr approach and fused to the gus reporter gene to determine where _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is most prevalent . figure and b show that in plate grown plants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ occurs in seeds prior to germination . in d old and week old seedlings _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is prevalent along elongated root tissue including root hairs and this pattern remains similar in mature roots . root cross sections indicate that _PROTEIN_ is predominantly in epidermal and cortical tissue and absent or limited in stelar regions . _PROTEIN_ in shoot tissues is virtually absent in very young seedlings but becomes more pronounced d after germination . initially _PROTEIN_ occurs in small clusters of cells that tend to concentrate near the leaf vasculature and cotyledon periphery creating a spotty pattern . during leaf development _PROTEIN_ gradually increases and becomes ubiquitous around the vascular bundles particularly those of mature leaves . leaves of comparable age from soil grown plants generally showed much lower levels of _PROTEIN_ possibly due to a different nutrient composition of this medium . a c terminal fusion between the _PROTEIN_ coding region and _METHOD_ was constructed in the part vector . this construct was used to _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ transiently in epidermal onion cells using gold particle biolistics . figure shows _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ under the control of the constitutive promoter only which generates diffuse and delocalized _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein is restricted to a defined pattern that predominantly comprises the peripheral _LOCATION_ although some _PROTEIN_ in _LOCATION_ type _LOCATION_ structures is also present which may be due to the use of a strong promoter . however transient homologous _PROTEIN_ in protoplasts showed the _METHOD_ signal exclusively in the cell periphery confirming a _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ location which was distinctly different from _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ marker lines . after protoplast lysis which releases intact _LOCATION_ no observable tonoplast _METHOD_ signal was observed .
