using various methods e.g. spectrophotometry circular dichroism and isothermal titration calorimetry the interaction of poncean s with human serum albumin _PROTEIN_ was characterized at ph and using the spectral correction technique and langmuir and temkin isothermal models . the consistency among results concerning e.g. binding number binding energy and type of binding showed that ion pair electrostatic attraction fixed the position of ps in _PROTEIN_ and subsequently induced a combination of multiple noncovalent bonds such as h bonds hydrophobic interactions and van der waals forces . ion pair attraction and h bonds produced a stable ps _PROTEIN_ complex and led to a marked change in the secondary structure of _PROTEIN_ in acidic media . the ps _PROTEIN_ binding pattern and the process of change in _PROTEIN_ conformation were also investigated . the potentially toxic effect of ps on the transport function of _PROTEIN_ in a normal physiological environment was analyzed . this work provides a useful experimental strategy for studying the interaction of organic substances with biomacromolecules helping us to understand the activity or mechanism of toxicity of an organic compound .
illustrates the color change of ps solution in the presence of _PROTEIN_ and also shows the chemical structure of ps . ps is an orange anionic azo compound in aqueous solution and it reacts with _PROTEIN_ to form a red product in solution . the absorption spectrum of the product shows a marked red shift . _PROTEIN_ ps solutions were measured in various ph media and their absorption spectra are shown in a . the interval between the positive peak and the negative trough increases with increasing acidity of solution . from curves the peak valley interval changes little when the ph is below . given the dissociation constants of the side groups of basic and acidic amino acid residues no r groups will have a negative charge when the ph is < whereas the r s of the basic aars will be positively charged . ps anions will enter the _PROTEIN_ cleft with no charge repulsion . however there are negatively charged acidic aars in _PROTEIN_ together with positively charged basic aars when the ph is > . entry of ps will therefore be opposed by charge repulsion . therefore from curves the binding of ps to _PROTEIN_ becomes progressively weaker . the two troughs in each curve indicate that ps _PROTEIN_ binding is heterogeneous at any ph i.e. there is a mixture of complexes linked via two three and four sulfonate groups because the ps concentration is not high enough . to compare the interactions of ps with _PROTEIN_ in various ph media including that of normal blood i.e. ph three buffer solutions ph and were used . from curves and in a and nm were the wavelengths that most clearly indicated the binding process and were used in subsequent work . from the absorption spectra shown in b it is apparent that formation of the ps _PROTEIN_ complex resulted in red shifts from to nm at ph and from to nm at ph and . interestingly a secondary trough appears at nm only in curve . a possible reason is that the unfolding of _PROTEIN_ at ph increases the distances among positively charged aars . the dissociation constants of ps were also determined spectrophotometrically and the results indicated that p k a is between and for h l and more than for _PROTEIN_ . therefore h l and _PROTEIN_ were both present in the ph solution leading to three and four ionic bonds between _PROTEIN_ and each ps molecule . thus ps _PROTEIN_ binding is heterogeneous at ph even if there is sufficient ps in solution to achieve saturation . the interaction of ps with _PROTEIN_ is summarized as follows n ps _PROTEIN_ k b _PROTEIN_ n initiation c l c m eqilibrium c l c nc c m c from the color change in it is clear that to determine the absorbance of the ps _PROTEIN_ complex in solution interference by excess ps in solution must be eliminated . the spectral correction technique proposed previously is a useful method for this it involves measuring solutions and . the effective fraction of ps bound to _PROTEIN_ and the molar ratio of ps bound to _PROTEIN_ are calculated by the relationships f a c a a and f c l c m where a c a a . returning to the reaction equation above c and c are the initial molar concentrations of _PROTEIN_ and ps a c indicates the real absorbance of the _PROTEIN_ ps complex in solution at nm which can not be measured directly . a and a are the absorbances of the _PROTEIN_ ps solution measured at and nm respectively against water and are correction constants and were calculated by measuring solutions and shown in . the value will approach the saturation number of ps bound with the increase of ps in a _PROTEIN_ solution . the absorbance ratios of the _PROTEIN_ ps solutions were measured at and nm . the a / a ratios in three ph media all _PROTEIN_ with increasing _PROTEIN_ concentration and approach a constant value of when the molar concentration of _PROTEIN_ is more than times that of ps . this indicates that more and more ps molecules became bound to _PROTEIN_ until no excess ps was free in solution i.e. solution in . thus the constant minimum should be of the binding product the values of ps in various media correspond to the a / a ratio in the absence of _PROTEIN_ which are located at the beginnings of curves . by measuring a series of ps solutions containing known concentrations of _PROTEIN_ a c f and were calculated using eqs . . the variation in with ps is shown in b the value increases with increasing ps concentration . moreover the values approach the following maxima when the ps/hsa molar ratio is more than when the ratio is more than and when the ratio is more than . these results indicate that the binding of ps to _PROTEIN_ is saturable . when more ps is added the fraction of excess ps steadily increases but does not change . thus n of ps molecules bound per molecule of _PROTEIN_ are at ph at ph and at ph . these values will be examined further in the following experiments . as described above all the basic aars in _PROTEIN_ form positively charged r groups in ph solution of < whereas all acidic aars will not dissociate . thus ps anions bind easily to the _PROTEIN_ surface until saturation is reached . in contrast negative r groups of the acidic aars rejecting the concentration of ps ions increases when ph is > . therefore n of ps at ph is much less than those in acidic media . the langmuir and temkin isothermal models below were used to fit the experimental data . n k n c l and n r t q ln a where c l is the equilibrium concentration of ps to be calculated by c l c k is the adsorption constant and q the adsorption energy of a saturating concentration of ps . the term a is a regression constant t the temperature in degrees kelvin and r the gas constant j mol k . the results are given in . the binding of ps to _PROTEIN_ fitted both models when the number of ps molecules per _PROTEIN_ molecule was less than the maximal binding number . therefore the interaction of ps with _PROTEIN_ corresponds to chemical monolayer adsorption . from the intercepts and gradients of the regression lines in a both n and k of ps may be calculated _PROTEIN_ . the n values were consistent with those obtained from . q of ps was calculated from the line gradients in b as shown in _PROTEIN_ . the increase in k and q values with increase in ph shows that ps binds more stably in neutral solution . a possible reason is that a low ps binding number resulted in more binding sites on _PROTEIN_ . in addition the binding of ps is exothermic because of the negative heat of adsorption . to understand the mechanism of _PROTEIN_ ps binding and to assess the effect of environmental conditions e.g. acidity on its specificity and stability detailed thermodynamic data are needed . itc measurements provide information on thermodynamic quantities such as enthalpy and heat capacity changes during the molecular interaction directly from the heat produced by the reaction and have been used to study for example protein ligand interactions dna triplex formation and human immunodeficiency virus protease activity . depicts a typical isothermal titration profile obtained by injecting ps into the itc cell containing _PROTEIN_ . an exothermic heat pulse is detected after each injection its magnitude progressively _PROTEIN_ until a plateau is reached corresponding to the heat of dilution of the peptide species in the buffer and indicating saturation . the heat evolved at each injection was corrected for the heat of dilution which was determined separately by injecting the ps solution into the buffer and divided by the number of moles injected . the resulting values were plotted as a function of the ps/hsa molar ratio and fitted to a sigmoid curve by a nonlinear least squares method . values for the equilibrium binding constant binding number enthalpy change and entropy change of the ps _PROTEIN_ reaction at various phs were obtained from curves x and calculated by the gibbs free energy equation g r t ln k b h t s . the thermodynamic parameters derived from these curves are summarized in _PROTEIN_ . comparison with the photometric method shows that the three measurements yield similar n values at three phs . h and q both become increasingly negative with increasing ph at and q approaches the h value at the same ph . therefore the temkin isothermal model can be used to explain the binding mechanism . because h is much less than kcal/mol the ps _PROTEIN_ interaction is noncovalent it involves h bonds ion pair attraction hydrophobic interactions and van der waals forces . the k b values indicate that the complex becomes more stable with increasing acidity of solution . this can be explained by the tendency of g to _PROTEIN_ with increasing ph _PROTEIN_ . comparison of the g h and s values suggests that the ps _PROTEIN_ interaction is amphipathic and h bonds and ion pair binding are both major contributors i.e. the interaction of ps with _PROTEIN_ depends on a combination of ion pair attraction and h bonds . moreover the heat released during the ps _PROTEIN_ reaction increases with increasing ph i.e. the ion pair attraction and h bonds between ps and _PROTEIN_ are weakened in more acidic solution . this indicates that the number of h bonds formed by ps is lower in more acidic solutions . as described above the unfolding of _PROTEIN_ at ph increases the distance among positively charged aars . in contrast s becomes more negative with increasing ph . this indicates that ps binding destroyed the internal hydrophobic interactions in _PROTEIN_ at ph values above replacing them with ion pair attraction and h bonds . the chemical structure of ps shows that all the aryls are enclosed by hydrophilic groups and ps has no lipophilic substituent e.g. the halogen or alkyl group . thus hydrophobic interactions between ps and _PROTEIN_ were probably weaker than the internal ones in _PROTEIN_ . on the other hand ps binding could have induced folding of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ the entropy . in addition comparison of the thermodynamic parameters of the solution between and at ph shows that h becomes more positive but s becomes more negative _PROTEIN_ . this indicates that ion pair attraction and h bonds were strengthened but hydrophobic interaction was weakened at normal physiological ph . electrostatic forces have an important role in the binding of ligands to proteins especially in acidic media . however the relationship between the number of anionic groups on a ligand and the number of basic aars on a protein has not yet been determined . from n / n b the effective binding rate of ps to _PROTEIN_ can be calculated where n b is the total number of protonated basic aars of _PROTEIN_ . the dissociation constants of the r groups of lys his and arg indicate that they are all positively charged when the ph is < . however only the r groups of lys and arg residues are protonated in neutral medium . thus n b is in acidic solution and in neutral solution . in a more acidic solution the peptide chain of a protein unfolds and there is little steric hindrance . if the binding of ps to _PROTEIN_ depended only on ion pair attraction should approach . from the n values obtained above of ps was calculated to be at ph at ph and at ph . because each ps molecule has four sulfonate groups it can bind to at most four basic aars so all the basic aars in _PROTEIN_ could bind to ps at ph and . however most of the ps molecules bound to the peptide chain via three sulfonates i.e. three ionic bonds at ph whereas most of them bound via four sulfonates at ph . _PROTEIN_ tends to fold at ph so steric hindrance increases leading to a marked _PROTEIN_ of even though ps may still bind via four ionic bonds . from the number of bonds formed by ps the ps _PROTEIN_ binding energy is low at ph as confirmed by the h values above . in conclusion ion pair attraction could have induced ps to enter the cleft of _PROTEIN_ i.e. electrostatic attraction plays a position fixing role in the interaction of the small ligand with the protein . once the ps molecules are positioned in _PROTEIN_ other noncovalent bonds hydrophobic interactions and van der waals act in combination . ps contains other potential binding groups in addition to the negatively charged groups e.g. and which could form h bonds with _PROTEIN_ side groups of aars in the peptide chain but there will be little hydrophobic interaction between ps and _PROTEIN_ as described above . an illustration of ps bound to the peptide chain in acidic solution is shown in . thus the combined action of noncovalent bonds will bind the small ligand firmly . as an example the side group of in the iia domain and those of and in the iiia domain would fix ps by ion pair bonds and then the side groups of and would bind the ps by h bonds . in a neutral solution ph the negative r groups of asp and glu which are distributed throughout the peptide chain will exclude the entry of ps anions even though the positive r s of lys and arg residues attract them . possibly only two spatial positions can be occupied by the ps anion i.e. between and and which have no negative r groups around them . this is consistent with the number of ps molecules bound at ph . the stability of a noncovalent complex is always affected by properties of the liquid environment in the body such as ph ionic strength and temperature . the effect of electrolytes on the value of ps in the _PROTEIN_ ps interaction is shown in a . with increasing electrolyte concentration _PROTEIN_ in various ph media and the change from curve was most evident at ph . its value in mol/l electrolyte is that in the absence of electrolyte at ph and ph but only at ph . this is due to the debye huckel screening where the debye length is inversely proportional to the square root of the ionic strength of solution . human blood normally contains mol/l electrolyte . from all curves in a is only slightly different in such a solution from in the absence of electrolyte . this implies that the ions in body fluids would not affect ps binding . when the ion concentration is increased to > mol/l the marked adsorption of ps suggests that such conditions could be favorable for transmission of endogenous substances and drugs . at higher temperature the protein cleft expands increasing the distance between the adjacent peptide chains . thus the effective number of ligand binding sites is reduced often causing desorption of ligand from the protein . however the interaction of ps with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ contradictory . at ph _PROTEIN_ from curve in b especially when the temperature is > . at _PROTEIN_ to from at room temperature . in contrast curves and indicate that increases slightly with warming . a ps _PROTEIN_ complex with a high binding number would form aggregates so that the ps would be physically adsorbed on the particle surfaces . the slightness of the effects of ionic strength < mol/l and temperature < indicates that ps binds strongly to _PROTEIN_ although the interaction is noncovalent . thus the penetration of ps like organic structures into the blood could inhibit the endogenous transport of drugs . to investigate the stability of the product with the highest ps binding number at ph a ps _PROTEIN_ solution prepared at ph was measured and then the ph was adjusted in situ step by step with mol/l and mol/l naoh from ph to was calculated at each ph by eq . and its variation is shown in c . the values in two such solutions containing saturating and semisaturating concentrations of ps approach those in b obtained from ps _PROTEIN_ solutions prepared independently at ph and . moreover _PROTEIN_ markedly when the ph exceeds the isoelectric point of _PROTEIN_ . this is attributed to the unfolding of _PROTEIN_ in acidic media and the protonation of basic aars which is less at ph values above . in addition the ps _PROTEIN_ complex formed at ph can be destroyed by low ph as indicated by the trend in i.e. binding to _PROTEIN_ is reversible and has not caused permanent denaturation . the specific conformation of a protein with a particular function results from covalent and noncovalent interactions among its amino acid residues . when an organic compound such as a pollutant drug or toxin is added to a protein solution the internal noncovalent interactions of the peptide chain may be altered and possibly destroyed changing the original conformation . in particular strong binding between a protein and an organic ligand may cause a permanent and irreversible change in the conformation and loss of the original function . cd _METHOD_ is often used to evaluate the secondary structure of a protein i.e. the contents of pleated sheet turn helix and random coil . the molar ellipticity cd curves of the ps _PROTEIN_ solutions in various ph media are shown in and the analytical results are summarized in _PROTEIN_ . the sheet content of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ to at ph and with less than saturating concentrations of ps where of all available binding sites in _PROTEIN_ were bound by ps . the disappearance of sheet resulted in a marked increase in turn content for example from at ph and at ph to and . moreover the helix content increased by . comparison between saturating and subsaturating concentrations of ps produced no obvious change in secondary structure contents though times the molarity of ps was added . thus a small amount of ps leads to a marked change of protein conformation in acidic media . c illustrates how the binding may affect changes from pleated sheet to helix and turn . on a single peptide chain ps could bridge the side groups c and c _PROTEIN_ by ion pair attraction . thus both the a c and e g sector sheets would rotate inversely around c to split the original h bonds between chains and leading to formation of an h bond between c o and nh . thus the pleated sheet is changed into a turn . if both r s were located on chains and such as c _PROTEIN_ and c respectively ion pair attraction would draw both of them close to the two available groups of ps by inverse rotation . because of the perturbation caused by ps the original h bonds between chains and would be destroyed and a new h bond between and of ps formed . therefore the sheet was changed into helix . in contrast all the secondary conformational _PROTEIN_ changed little at ph even with saturating ps concentrations . this is presumably because there is too little binding of ps at ph to affect the conformation of _PROTEIN_ markedly . as a deduction the binding of ps to proteins or enzymes in acidic environments e.g. stomach and skin secretions might produce obvious toxicity . in normal blood the tight binding of ps to _PROTEIN_ would inhibit the transmission of endogenous substances and drugs though the secondary conformation of _PROTEIN_ would not be markedly altered . the characterization of the binding reaction and the effects of electrolyte and ph described above indicate that the interaction between ps and _PROTEIN_ is influenced by a range of experimental conditions such as ionic strength < mol/l ph between and and temperature < . thus it may be used for protein assay by larva which has more than times the analytical sensitivity of ordinary spectrophotometry . if edta is added to sequester most metal ions this binding reaction is very selective . three standard series of _PROTEIN_ were prepared and the regression equations are given in _PROTEIN_ . the lod of _PROTEIN_ defined as times the standard deviation of replicated blanks was also calculated and is given in _PROTEIN_ the less ps added the higher the sensitivity obtained . however too low a ps concentration could cause an obvious measurement _LOCATION_ because of background instrument noise . the lods of series and are the lowest but series gives the best linearity . thus mol/l ps was added to determine the protein concentrations in samples such as food and blood . the corresponding lod of protein is mg/l . edta was used to sequester most of the metals that might occur in the samples . the results indicate that none of the following species affected the direct determination of mg/l _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ with ps mg/l lysine glutamine alanine mg/l k cl mg/l ca p o _PROTEIN_ mg/l mg s o vitamin c mg/l zn fe fe and mg/l cu . therefore the recommended method was selective and suitable for quantitative analysis of water soluble proteins . five egg white milk human blood _PROTEIN_ serum and eel determined . both quail egg white and milk may be diluted and then colored directly . the other samples were treated according to the following procedures ml blood extracted from human or animal veins was centrifuged at rpm for min and ml of the supernatant was diluted to ml . after mixing protein was assayed . the results are given in _PROTEIN_ . they agreed with the values obtained by classical _METHOD_ brilliant blue colorimetry . this indicates that the proposed method is accurate and reliable for practical analysis .
the absorption spectra of ps and protein solutions were recorded with a model lambda spectrophotometer equipped with a thermostatic cell holder linked to a model _PROTEIN_ water circulated thermostatic oven . the spectrophotometer was computer controlled using uv winlab software . the itc experiments were carried out on a model _METHOD_ itc system with measurement software . a model j cd spectropolarimeter with secondary structure estimation standard analysis measurement software was used to determine protein conformation . a model dk electrothermic multiporous constant temperature was used in the temperature experiment . solution phs were measured with a model phs acidity meter . _PROTEIN_ was dissolved in ml deionized water as a stock solution _PROTEIN_ . solutions _PROTEIN_ were prepared daily by diluting the stock and were stored at . ps stock solution was prepared by dissolving mg of ps in ml deionized water . solutions of mmol/l ps were prepared daily by diluting the stock . a series of britton robinson buffers ph and were prepared to adjust the acidities of solutions . a mol/l nacl solution was prepared in deionized water to adjust the ionic strengths of solutions to investigate the effects of electrolyte on noncovalent binding . both mol/l edta and ph acetic acetate buffer were prepared and used only in protein assays . all studies were carried out in a ml calibrated flask containing a known volume of _PROTEIN_ solution ml of b r buffer and a known volume of mmol/l ps . the solution was diluted to ml with deionized water and mixed thoroughly . after the reaction had proceeded for min the absorbances a and a of the _PROTEIN_ ps solutions and a and a of the reagent blank _PROTEIN_ were measured at nm and nm against water . the parameters a c f and of each solution were calculated . the langmuir and temkin isothermal models were applied to fit plots vs. c l and vs. ln . finally n k and q were calculated . itc experiments were carried out as follows . the ps solution was injected times in l increments at min intervals into the isothermal cell containing _PROTEIN_ . the cell temperature remained at or . heats of dilution of ps obtained separately by injecting into the buffer were used to correct the data . the corrected heats were divided by the number of moles injected and analyzed using the origin software supplied by the manufacturer . the titration curve was fitted by a nonlinear least squares method and n k b h and s were determined . buffer was mixed with mg/ml _PROTEIN_ in three flasks or mmol/l ps was added . the solutions were diluted to ml with deionized water . simultaneously a reagent blank without ps was prepared . before measurement all the solutions were diluted from to ml with deionized water . each sample was allowed to equilibrate for min then injected into a cm light path cell and the mean residue ellipticity of _PROTEIN_ was measured between and nm . from the mre curves the relative contents of secondary structure _METHOD_ of _PROTEIN_ helix pleated sheet turn and random calculated in all the solutions . light absorption ratio variation was used to assay protein with very high sensitivity . a known volume of a sample containing < g of protein was added to a ml flask along with ml mmol/l edta and ml of ph acetate buffer . after mixing mol/l ps was added and the solution was diluted to ml with deionized water . after min the absorbances of the solution were measured at and nm against water . using the same method a reagent blank without protein was prepared and the absorbances were measured . the absorbance ratio difference of the ps _PROTEIN_ solution was calculated by the relationship a r a nm a nm a nm a nm . a r is linearly related to the protein concentration as follows a r p c m q where p and q are constants obtained by linear regression of plots of a r vs. c from the series of standard _PROTEIN_ solutions . the variable p as the sensitivity _PROTEIN_ is inversely proportional to the initial concentration of ligand the less l added the higher the sensitivity obtained . however too low a ps concentration will cause an obvious measurement _LOCATION_ because of background instrument noise . to optimize the addition ps was added in three concentrations to the series of standard _PROTEIN_ solutions and the a r of each was calculated . by considering both the low limit of detection and the linearity an optimal ps concentration was selected .
