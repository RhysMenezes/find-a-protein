in contrast to animals where polyamine _PROTEIN_ catabolism efficiently converts spermine to putrescine plants have been considered to possess a _PROTEIN_ catabolic pathway producing diaminopropane _PROTEIN_ the corresponding aldehyde and hydrogen peroxide but unable to back convert spm to put . arabidopsis genome contains at least five putative _PROTEIN_ oxidase _PROTEIN_ members with yet unknown localization and physiological role . _PROTEIN_ was recently identified as an enzyme similar to the mammalian spm oxidase which converts spm to spermidine . in this work we have performed in silico analysis of the five arabidopsis genes and have identified _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ as a nontypical _PROTEIN_ in _METHOD_ of homology compared to other known _PROTEIN_ . we have _PROTEIN_ the gene _PROTEIN_ and have purified a protein corresponding to it using the inducible heterologous _PROTEIN_ system of escherichia coli . _PROTEIN_ catalyzed the sequential conversion/oxidation of spm to spd and of spd to put thus exhibiting functional homology to the mammalian _PROTEIN_ . the best substrate for this pathway was spd whereas the acetyl derivatives of spm and spd were oxidized less efficiently . on the other hand no activity was detected when diamines were used as substrates . moreover although _PROTEIN_ does not exhibit significant similarity to the other known _PROTEIN_ it is efficiently inhibited by guazatine a potent _PROTEIN_ inhibitor . _PROTEIN_ contains a peroxisomal targeting motif at the c terminus and it targets green _METHOD_ protein to _LOCATION_ when fused at the n terminus but not at the c terminus . these results reveal that _PROTEIN_ is a peroxisomal protein and that the c terminus of the protein contains the sorting information . the overall data reinforce the view that plants and mammals possess a similar _PROTEIN_ oxidation system concerning both the subcellular localization and the mode of its action .
in silico analysis of the arabidopsis genome showed that it contains five putative _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ all of which encode proteins with a single amine oxidase domain . irrespective of their origin all _PROTEIN_ proteins contain four conserved motifs . more specifically _PROTEIN_ in their n terminus contain a flavin adenine dinucleotide binding motif while the positions to to and to approximately contain three specific _PROTEIN_ motifs . all these motifs were present in _PROTEIN_ as indicated using the simple modular architecture research tool software . sequence comparison and phylogenetic analysis of the five putative genes indicated that _PROTEIN_ genes in arabidopsis can be separated into three paraphyletic groups . more specifically the gene _PROTEIN_ can be classified with the well characterized plant _PROTEIN_ genes from maize and tobacco . on the other hand _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ can be clustered together in one group while _PROTEIN_ is the most distinct _PROTEIN_ gene . in mammals _PROTEIN_ able to back convert _PROTEIN_ are localized in _LOCATION_ . from the above mentioned arabidopsis genes _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are predicted from the araperox database to be localized in plant _LOCATION_ containing a peroxisomal targeting signal type signal responsible for the localization of mammalian _PROTEIN_ in _LOCATION_ . these triggered us to further investigate _PROTEIN_ as a starting point for the comparative analysis between plant and mammalian _PROTEIN_ catabolism . _PROTEIN_ protein exhibits identity with _PROTEIN_ identity with an unknown protein from vitis vinifera identity with gene product from oryza sativa and identity with _PROTEIN_ . the similarity to other _PROTEIN_ including those localized in _LOCATION_ of mammals was very low . the coding region of the _PROTEIN_ cdna was obtained by performing pcr on a puni vector containing the _PROTEIN_ cdna _PROTEIN_ . the size of the _PROTEIN_ coding region is bp . in addition we checked the _PROTEIN_ of the gene in both leaves and roots using reverse transcription pcr and detected that the gene is mostly _PROTEIN_ in the leaves . _PROTEIN_ encodes for a amino acid protein with a calculated molecular _METHOD_ of kd and pi . to overexpress the _PROTEIN_ protein in a heterologous system the _PROTEIN_ cdna containing the complete open reading frame was introduced into the pdest _PROTEIN_ vector to fuse _PROTEIN_ to the maltose binding protein _PROTEIN_ under the inducible tac promoter . this construct was introduced into escherichia coli cells and induced with isopropyl d thiogalactopyranoside for protein _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ protein was detected at high levels in total cell lysates as soon as h after induction . at the accumulation of the mbp _PROTEIN_ protein was found mostly in the pellet fraction of cell lysates as indicated using an anti mbp specific polyclonal antibody . after _PROTEIN_ the culture temperature from to and the inductive iptg concentration from mm to mm higher mbp _PROTEIN_ protein accumulation was detected in the soluble fraction . lower temperatures or iptg concentrations did not have any significant effect on the amount of mbp _PROTEIN_ protein accumulation . to purify the mbp _PROTEIN_ protein supernatants from cell lysates from induced cultures were passed through an amylose resin to bind the mbp tag and _PROTEIN_ protein was purified to > . furthermore digestion of the mbp _PROTEIN_ fusion with the xa _PROTEIN_ a protease that specifically cleaves the junction between the mbp and _PROTEIN_ in the ile leu glu gly arg sequence resulted in two separate proteins mbp with a molecular _METHOD_ of kd and _PROTEIN_ with a molecular _METHOD_ of kd . the mbp _PROTEIN_ protein was further purified using gel filtration . more specifically the mbp _PROTEIN_ protein sample was applied again to an amylose resin and subsequently to a sephadex gel filtration column equilibrated with mbp buffer ph . elution was performed with the same buffer collecting fractions of ml . the procedure was repeated twice and the mbp _PROTEIN_ protein was dialyzed in mbp buffer . more than mg of recombinant mbp _PROTEIN_ culture could be obtained after the gel filtration step at and inductive iptg mm . the _PROTEIN_ protein was further purified from the mbp tag after digestion with the xa _PROTEIN_ by applying it to an amylose resin to rebind the mbp . the xa _PROTEIN_ was removed through a hydroxyapatite column resulting in a single band corresponding to the _PROTEIN_ protein . the final purified protein was subsequently used for the following experiments . _PROTEIN_ proteins characterized so far are flavoproteins able to bind via noncovalent bond fad molecule that act as electron donors to molecular oxygen necessary for _PROTEIN_ oxidizing activity . thus in silico analysis of the _PROTEIN_ protein showed that it contains at the n terminus of the protein a domain responsible for the binding of a fad molecule . to test whether _PROTEIN_ protein is able to bind to a fad molecule in vitro we disrupted the noncovalent bonds through addition of tca to the purified protein which was subsequently precipitated . supernatant absorbance was measured and exhibited the characteristic two curve spectrum typical for fad containing proteins with absorption maxima at and nm indicating that _PROTEIN_ is in an oxidized state . a similar spectrum was obtained without disrupting the bonds between the fad and _PROTEIN_ while the slight differences observed are most probably due to the protein microenvironment that surrounds the fad molecule which alters its absorbance characteristics . no significant differences were observed between the _PROTEIN_ and mbp _PROTEIN_ absorbance suggesting that mbp protein does not affect the absorbance features of protein . each mole of protein could adhere approximately mol of fad suggesting a close to molecular ratio for fad _PROTEIN_ protein . in some cases the supernatant exhibited an absorbance peak at nm indicating contamination of the supernatant from the precipitated protein . in plants most characterized proteins encoded by _PROTEIN_ genes are responsible for the terminal catabolism of spd and spm . only recently was the arabidopsis gene _PROTEIN_ shown to encode for a fad binding _PROTEIN_ protein that exhibits a single step back conversion activity converting spm to spd . analysis of the substrate specificity of the protein purified in this work showed that _PROTEIN_ is able to oxidize both spd and spm producing whereas no oxidizing activity was found when using put . both the crude bacterial lysate and the purified protein exhibited similar activities with respect to the oxidizing specificity . interestingly _PROTEIN_ was not a product of _PROTEIN_ as no yellowish product was observed after its reaction with o aminobenzaldehyde typical for most _PROTEIN_ enzymes that catalyze the terminal deamination of spd and spm . the previous results prompted us to identify the reaction products of _PROTEIN_ oxidizing activity . to this end an in vitro assay and hplc were combined . analysis of the reaction products revealed that both spm and spd are oxidized by _PROTEIN_ giving rise to spd and put or put alone respectively without any concomitant production of diaminopropane . production of put from spm could be detected after approximately min in the in vitro assay using of _PROTEIN_ protein while when spd was used as substrate significantly higher amounts of put at the same time points could be observed . these results reinforce the view that _PROTEIN_ encodes for an enzyme with _PROTEIN_ oxidizing activity able to back convert spm and spd to the final product put in a two step reaction producing as end product . the ph optimum for the oxidation of the substrates was found to be similar to _PROTEIN_ but different from that of zmpao . interestingly the enzyme was quickly inactivated at lower ph values and at ph > or < no significant activity was found . the ph dependence of the enzyme did not follow the bell shaped dependency of _PROTEIN_ suggesting different ionization groups within the active site . interestingly the mouse peroxisomal _PROTEIN_ exhibits similar ph dependence . the optimum temperature was found to be similar to the homo sapiens peroxisomal _PROTEIN_ whereas at higher temperatures the enzyme was quickly inactivated . moreover equimolar amounts of spd and put to spm were produced via _PROTEIN_ oxidation activity . the enzyme exhibited a progressive inactivation with time possibly due to end product inhibition either through or put . to further confirm the back converting activity of _PROTEIN_ a radiometric method was employed using radiolabeled _PROTEIN_ as substrates and the conversion efficiency to each product was estimated as a fraction of time . thus of the initial spd was converted to put within h while of initial spm was converted to spd and put at the same time point . on the contrary radiolabeled put was not recognized as substrate by _PROTEIN_ . because the known mammalian _PROTEIN_ oxidize acetyl derivatives with higher affinity than the nonacetylated ones the in vitro activity of _PROTEIN_ was determined not only using spd and spm as substrates but also using acspd acspd and acspm . _PROTEIN_ was found to oxidize not only spd and spm but also acspd and acspm converting them to acspd and acput respectively . the substrate specificity was spd > spm > acspd > acspm suggesting that _PROTEIN_ differs with respect to the substrate specificity from the functionally homologous mammalian enzymes . kinetics in the presence/absence of specific inhibitors for the _PROTEIN_ enzyme data are the means from a single representative experiment . in addition the inhibition constants of two well known _PROTEIN_ inhibitors guazatine and aminoguanidine were determined using spd as substrate . guazatine the most potent inhibitor characterized so far for _PROTEIN_ enzymes including _PROTEIN_ significantly inhibited _PROTEIN_ activity with a ki of . aminoguanidine also inhibited _PROTEIN_ but with a higher ki of . in addition put the end product of _PROTEIN_ activity and acspd also inhibited the enzyme . put similarly inhibited _PROTEIN_ when using spm acspd and acspm as substrates . in silico protein localization prediction software failed to identify _PROTEIN_ as a putative peroxisomal protein . however _PROTEIN_ contains a peroxisomal targeting signal consisting of a ser an arg and a met residue _PROTEIN_ at the c terminal end of the protein which has been shown to target proteins to _LOCATION_ in plants . to investigate the in vivo _PROTEIN_ localization we fused _PROTEIN_ cdna to either the c terminal _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ or n terminal _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ part of the _METHOD_ . agrobacterium mediated transient _PROTEIN_ of the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in n. benthamiana leaves showed a green _METHOD_ pattern in small spots distributed throughout the cytoplasm of the epidermal cells . in contrast when _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ construct was used a diffuse _METHOD_ throughout the cytoplasm was found suggesting that the fusion remained as a soluble protein in the _LOCATION_ . these results indicate that _PROTEIN_ has targeting information to small cytoplasmic organelles and that the sorting motifs are masked when _METHOD_ is fused to the c terminus . to determine where _PROTEIN_ is localized we performed a colocalization experiment using yellow _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ and cherry markers of compartments that resembled the spots observed in _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . agrobacterium mediated transient _PROTEIN_ of the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in n. benthamiana leaves with simultaneous cotransformation of the mcherry skl or the _METHOD_ skl showed that the signals colocalized suggesting that _PROTEIN_ is a peroxisomal protein . on the contrary _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ did not colocalize . because _LOCATION_ are organelles involved in various stress responses we decided to monitor the abundance of _PROTEIN_ mrna under various stress treatments . in addition to gain a more comprehensive view of the regulation of _PROTEIN_ catabolism and to compare to _PROTEIN_ we monitored the _PROTEIN_ of the other members of the _PROTEIN_ gene family under the same conditions . thus the _PROTEIN_ pattern of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ was followed after supplying d old arabidopsis seedlings with various chemicals for h . interestingly _PROTEIN_ could not be detected either by rt pcr or by northern blotting under the various treatments consistent with the results obtained by citation . among the various treatments performed abscisic acid induced _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mrna accumulation h posttreatment while induction of _PROTEIN_ took longer . on the other hand _PROTEIN_ mrna abundance was slightly reduced upon aba treatment . interestingly _PROTEIN_ mrna returned to basal levels after h in aba treated plants . ja treated seedlings showed a marked and transient increase in _PROTEIN_ mrna constantly accumulated up to h to _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ at h while _PROTEIN_ mrna accumulated only h posttreatment . treatment with ja did not provoke any significant increase of _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ mrnas at all time points examined . sa treatment clearly induced _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mrna accumulation h posttreatment while _PROTEIN_ showed a slight increase h posttreatment . interestingly _PROTEIN_ significantly accumulated after h at mm sa . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mrna rapidly accumulated in wounded plants h after wounding and returned to almost basal levels h thereafter . in addition seedlings treated with flagellin a pathogen elicitor that activates the plant basal defense exhibited _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ induction after the h time point with constant increase up to h while _PROTEIN_ was induced h posttreatment returning to basal levels h thereafter . on the other hand _PROTEIN_ mrna abundance showed a significant _PROTEIN_ in seedlings treated with flagellin .
