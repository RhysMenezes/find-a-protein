arabidopsis thaliana is a host to the powdery mildew _LOCATION_ cichoracearum and nonhost to blumeria graminis f. sp hordei the powdery mildew pathogenic on barley . screening for arabidopsis mutants deficient in resistance to barley powdery mildew identified _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ plants permitted both increased invasion into epidermal cells and initiation of hyphae by b. g. hordei suggesting that _PROTEIN_ contributes to defenses at the cell wall and intracellularly . _PROTEIN_ mutants were compromised in resistance to the necrotroph plectosphaerella cucumerina and to two additional inappropriate biotrophs pea powdery mildew _LOCATION_ and potato _PROTEIN_ blight . unexpectedly _PROTEIN_ mutants were resistant to e. cichoracearum . this resistance was salicylic acid dependent and correlated with chlorotic patches . consistent with this observation salicylic acid pathway genes were hyperinduced in _PROTEIN_ relative to the wild type . the phenotypes conferred by _PROTEIN_ result from the loss of function of _PROTEIN_ drug _PROTEIN_ a highly _PROTEIN_ putative _PROTEIN_ binding cassette transporter . _PROTEIN_ tagged with green _METHOD_ protein localized to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ in uninfected cells . in infected leaves the protein concentrated at infection sites . _PROTEIN_ may be involved in exporting toxic materials to attempted invasion sites and intracellular accumulation of these toxins in _PROTEIN_ may secondarily activate the salicylic acid pathway .
we conducted a screen for the loss of penetration resistance by screening for arabidopsis mutants that allowed b. g. hordei to form haustoria within epidermal cells at a higher frequency than on wild type plants . haustoria which are fungal feeding structures encased in a specialized host _LOCATION_ within epidermal cells are produced once the fungal germlings have successfully breached the host cell wall . the few b. g. hordei haustoria that formed in arabidopsis were rapidly encased in callose and could be recognized by their distinctive oval shape in inoculated leaves stained with the callose stain aniline blue . nine pen mutants were recovered from plants from ethyl methanesulfonate mutagenized seeds . mapping experiments and crosses among the mutants were used to place the pen mutants in complementation groups . when the identities of the pen genes became known allelism among the various mutants was confirmed by sequencing the appropriate gene _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were recovered from this screen . _PROTEIN_ like the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants supported a higher frequency of fungal penetration . another feature of the phenotype conferred by _PROTEIN_ was that callose deposition lining the entire periphery of invaded epidermal cells was more common than in wild type plants . compared with wild type plants _PROTEIN_ plants also allowed increased frequency of formation of elongating secondary hyphae an indication that the underlying haustoria were functional . secondary hyphae are the hyphae that emerge from the conidium after the first haustorium is established . germ tube growth is supported by reserves in the conidium whereas the emergence and growth of secondary hyphae are thought to be dependent on nutrients acquired from the host via the haustorium . therefore _PROTEIN_ mutants were partially compromised not only in penetration resistance against b. g. hordei but also in a mechanism restricting haustorium function . loss of _PROTEIN_ function does not allow b. g. hordei to complete its life cycle and form asexual conidia on arabidopsis as it does on barley suggesting that additional _PROTEIN_ contribute to nonhost resistance to b. g. hordei in arabidopsis . to determine whether increased pathogen entry was limited to interactions with b. g. hordei _PROTEIN_ plants were inoculated with two other inappropriate pathogens . _LOCATION_ pisi _LOCATION_ the powdery mildew pathogenic on pea belongs to a tribe distinct from _LOCATION_ cichoracearum and b. g. hordei . similar to b. g. hordei e. pisi was able to initiate the formation of elongating secondary hyphae at a higher frequency on _PROTEIN_ than on wild type plants . likewise phytophthora infestans which is a hemibiotrophic oomycete pathogen and the causal agent of _PROTEIN_ blight in potato formed invasive hyphae which were encased in callose more often in _PROTEIN_ mutants than in wild type plants . inoculation with p. infestans elicited little callose deposition in wild type plants whereas dramatic callose deposition was observed in _PROTEIN_ epidermal cells . when it occurred penetration by p. infestans into arabidopsis epidermal cells was often accompanied by local cell death at sites of infection . although the wild type appeared healthy where droplets of p. infestans zoospores had been applied _PROTEIN_ exhibited macroscopic cell death consistent with the idea that a greater proportion of oomycete individuals had penetrated into host cells and elicited cell death . thus _PROTEIN_ had a diminished capacity to restrict pathogen entry by three different inappropriate pathogens . mapping populations were generated by crossing _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ to landsberg _LOCATION_ . mutant plants identified in the generation were used for bulk segregant mapping . in both crosses _PROTEIN_ mapped to the bottom of chromosome between markers _PROTEIN_ and . these two markers were used to identify additional recombinants in this genetic interval from plants . in this manner the interval containing _PROTEIN_ was delimited to a region encompassed by bac . nineteen t dna mutant populations with insertions in of genes in this interval were screened for the phenotype conferred by pen after inoculation with b. g. hordei . two of these t dna populations segregated plants with a penetration deficient phenotype . these mutants had predicted insertions in a pdr like abc transporter . both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ carried single nucleotide substitutions at nucleotides and respectively from the a of the _PROTEIN_ initiation codon of the genomic sequence for this gene . two t dna alleles _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ had insertions near the end of the coding region . the _PROTEIN_ gene had previously been annotated as _PROTEIN_ based on its homology with yeast pdr transporters . it encodes a kb cdna and is predicted to encode a amino acid protein with transmembrane domains . arabidopsis has pdr family members which are highly similar at the amino acid level . an alignment of these members showed that the point mutations in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ occurred in highly conserved regions of the nucleotide binding folds . the nucleotide binding folds are thought to mediate _PROTEIN_ binding and consist of a walker a motif followed by an abc signature motif and a walker b motif . the mutation in _PROTEIN_ converted a gly to an asp in the abc signature motif of the first nucleotide binding fold whereas the mutation in _PROTEIN_ converted a gly to a ser in the walker a motif of the second nucleotide binding fold . _PROTEIN_ transcript was detected in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ but not in the t dna mutants _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . given that all four _PROTEIN_ alleles have identical phenotypes we assume that proteins encoded by _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are nonfunctional at least in nonhost resistance . the arabidopsis pdr family of abc transporters has been studied via rna gel blotting and rt pcr to determine in which plant organs these transporters are _PROTEIN_ . in addition publicly available databases provide microarray _PROTEIN_ profiles of different arabidopsis organs tissues and environmental treatments . these resources showed that _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ in all tissues but most highly in leaves . most other pdr family members were _PROTEIN_ at low levels and in specific plant organs . in leaves _PROTEIN_ transcript accumulated to levels comparable to those of metabolic housekeeping genes such as _LOCATION_ glyceraldehyde phosphate and to orders of magnitude higher than the other pdr family members . the gene encoding _PROTEIN_ the abc transporter most similar to _PROTEIN_ in sequence was _PROTEIN_ primarily in roots and t dna insertion mutations in _PROTEIN_ did not exhibit the penetration deficient phenotype . these microarray data together with rna gel blot analyses indicate that _PROTEIN_ is highly and ubiquitously _PROTEIN_ in plant tissues . these data further suggest that there is limited functional redundancy among the pdr genes and _PROTEIN_ . publicly available _PROTEIN_ data were mined to determine whether _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was modified after pathogen attack . induction was modest after inoculation with virulent pathogens inappropriate pathogens and nonspecific elicitors but dramatic after inoculation with avirulent bacteria and the phloem feeding aphid myzus persicae . induction by the peptide a synthetic version of a conserved region of flagellin was abolished in plants lacking _PROTEIN_ a receptor like kinase required for flagellin perception . exposure to methyl jasmonate ozone and the herbicides primisulfuron and prosulfuron also induced _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . although these two herbicides interfere with the synthesis of branched chain amino acids an herbicide that targets photosystem ii bromoxynil did not induce _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . abscisic acid and heat shock treatments downregulated the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ . thus _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is altered by pathogens and a subset of abiotic stresses . to examine the possibility that _PROTEIN_ plants were also defective in basal resistance to virulent pathogens they were infected with the arabidopsis powdery mildew e. cichoracearum . surprisingly _PROTEIN_ plants underwent chlorosis and cell death after e. cichoracearum infection . closer inspection indicated that cell death was fungus associated and did not spread extensively beyond areas of fungal colonization . by d after inoculation e. cichoracearum hyphae had elongated on wild type leaves leaving a trail of callose containing papillae at each penetration site . by contrast hyphal elongation on _PROTEIN_ plants was accompanied by extensive callose deposition preceding the death of penetrated cells . by dai extensive conidiation was observed on wild type plants whereas colonies that formed on _PROTEIN_ were stunted lacked conidiophores and were overlaid with patches of dead cells . additionally _PROTEIN_ plants were inoculated with the broad host range necrotrophs botrytis cinerea and p. cucumerina . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants were more susceptible to p. cucumerina than wild type plants . leaf tissue damage and fresh weight reduction caused by this fungus were greater in _PROTEIN_ mutants than in wild type plants and similar to the damage observed in the highly susceptible _PROTEIN_ mutant which is impaired in the subunit of arabidopsis heterotrimeric g protein . resistance of _PROTEIN_ plants to b. cinerea did not differ from that of wild type plants . cell death in response to pathogen attack is often associated with the activation of the sa defense pathway . similarly chlorosis is associated with high levels of et production . double mutants were generated between _PROTEIN_ and mutants affecting the sa and et/ja pathways to determine whether these defense signaling pathways were necessary for the pathogen induced chlorosis and necrosis phenotype . transgenic nahg plants as well as mutants lacking a functional sa pathway such as _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ suppressed the cell death and resistance phenotypes of _PROTEIN_ allowing e. cichoracearum to conidiate . the effect of two other sa related mutants _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ on resistance to e. cichoracearum in _PROTEIN_ was also investigated . mutations in _PROTEIN_ did not affect the occurrence of cell death in inoculated _PROTEIN_ . however in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutants conidiation was observed initially but chlorosis and cell death were delayed to dai . triple _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutants resembled _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutants . mutations that affect the et/ja pathway such as _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ did not alter the _PROTEIN_ cell death phenotype . thus _PROTEIN_ resistance to the arabidopsis powdery mildew is sa dependent and et/ja independent . disease development after p. cucumerina infection was modestly enhanced in the sa deficient lines _PROTEIN_ and nahg as reported previously although to a lesser extent than in _PROTEIN_ . the enhanced susceptibility to p. cucumerina observed in _PROTEIN_ mutants was further enhanced in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ nahg double mutant lines suggesting that _PROTEIN_ acts additively with the sa pathway to limit p. cucumerina infections . we considered the possibility that a propensity to become chlorotic and necrotic could indirectly result in increased pathogen entry . to address this question a set of arabidopsis mutants that are resistant to the host powdery mildew pathogen were examined for _PROTEIN_ like phenotypes . this collection included published cpr acd agd and pmr mutants as well as a set of mil mutants . only one of these mutants exhibited both increased penetration by b. g. hordei and resistance to e. cichoracearum . the _PROTEIN_ gene from contained a point mutation at nucleotide which is predicted to change a trp codon to a stop codon . thus mutants prone to chlorosis and cell death do not commonly allow increased invasion by inappropriate pathogens . unlike _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were not resistant to e. cichoracearum and did not become chlorotic upon infection . as shown by the more rapid appearance of visible _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was more susceptible to e. cichoracearum than the wild type indicating that _PROTEIN_ is important for both basal and nonhost resistance . the _PROTEIN_ mutation was not able to suppress the e. cichoracearum induced cell death of _PROTEIN_ . in a _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant however cell death was delayed and resistance was compromised relative to the _PROTEIN_ mutant . although some conidiation occurred _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ leaves underwent cell death and chlorosis at dai . thus _PROTEIN_ resistance to e. cichoracearum plants is partially dependent on _PROTEIN_ . in addition _PROTEIN_ but not _PROTEIN_ was more susceptible to p. cucumerina than the wild type but to a lesser degree than _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . the double mutants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ resembled the _PROTEIN_ single mutants in their susceptibility to p. cucumerina . e. cichoracearum infection was not the only stress capable of inducing chlorosis and cell death in _PROTEIN_ plants . although _PROTEIN_ plants were indistinguishable from wild type plants up to weeks after germination eventually they became chlorotic and senesced earlier than wild type plants . this phenotype was exacerbated by growth in continuous high light . high light induced chlorosis and senescence were suppressed by mutations in the sa pathway but not by those in the et/ja pathway . thus the sa pathway appears to be necessary for heightened sensitivity to abiotic stress in _PROTEIN_ plants as well . none of the mutations in the sa and et/ja pathways tested reversed the loss of penetration resistance to b. g. hordei . however plants carrying the nahg transgene and plants carrying mutations in _PROTEIN_ were slightly compromised in their ability to restrict b. g. hordei entry into epidermal cells relative to wild type plants . microscopic inspection of the invasion and growth of b. g. hordei on double and single mutants revealed that the frequencies of fungal penetration on _PROTEIN_ nahg and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were higher than those on the single mutants . colonies growing on these double mutant combinations were typically twice the average size than those growing on the single mutants . this increase in growth was accompanied by an increase in hyphal branching . conidiation by b. g. hordei was not observed . e. pisi epiphytic growth was increased on _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants compared with wild type plants . a cumulative effect was seen on _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutants on which e. pisi colonies consisted of dense leaf spanning mycelia accompanied by occasional conidiophore formation . e. pisi conidia recovered from arabidopsis double mutants were able to successfully infect pea and cause disease . we compared the transcript profiles of wild type and _PROTEIN_ plants at dai with e. cichoracearum or b. g. hordei using full genome affymetrix microarrays . of the probe sets on the microarray exhibited some change in _PROTEIN_ in this experiment . when considering the trends observed in the _PROTEIN_ patterns of these genes two _PROTEIN_ clusters were observed genes induced by and genes repressed by pathogen attack . as described previously b. g. hordei elicited a more dramatic response than e. cichoracearum . transcripts with increased levels after inoculation with the fungal pathogens included defense related transcripts primarily whereas transcripts with reduced levels consisted in large part of transcripts encoding photosynthetic and metabolic components . it is possible that plants respond more dramatically to b. g. hordei because it can not evade or suppress basal defenses as efficiently as the host powdery mildew e. cichoracearum . in addition responses to inoculation were more dramatic in _PROTEIN_ than in the wild type . included among these genes were several sa associated genes . these included genes of the sa pathway such as _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ as well as downstream sa pathway markers such as pr pr chitinases and _PROTEIN_ . this hyperactivation of sa defenses together with the double mutant analysis suggests that the basis for the resistance to e. cichoracearum observed in _PROTEIN_ plants is an enhanced activation of the sa pathway . examples of sa induced or sa pathway associated genes that are hyperinduced in _PROTEIN_ mutants after inoculation with either the arabidopsis or the barley powdery mildew a single transcript was highly upregulated in _PROTEIN_ independent infection status . this observation was confirmed by semiquantitative rt pcr using independent samples . in addition the _PROTEIN_ of this gene did not change very much upon inoculation with pathogens in either _PROTEIN_ or the wild type _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . no other gene exhibited this _PROTEIN_ pattern . this gene is predicted to encode a amino acid polypeptide with no significant homology with any known protein . ests have been found for this transcript and array data show that this transcript responds to high _PROTEIN_ and is constitutively upregulated in the et insensitive _PROTEIN_ mutant . unlike _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutants resemble wild type plants in their ability to restrict the entry of b. g. hordei into epidermal cells and _PROTEIN_ plants are susceptible to e. cichoracearum . thus high levels of _PROTEIN_ of this uncharacterized gene are not sufficient to account for the mutant phenotypes of _PROTEIN_ . of the pdr genes only three including _PROTEIN_ changed _PROTEIN_ after inoculation with pathogens . although _PROTEIN_ was repressed after infection _PROTEIN_ was induced and its induction was dramatically enhanced in b. g. hordei inoculated _PROTEIN_ plants . in plants abc transporters have been localized to the tonoplast mitochondria chloroplasts and _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . recently proteomic studies of different organelles have placed _PROTEIN_ in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ mitochondria and chloroplasts . given its high abundance _PROTEIN_ is likely a common contaminant in organelle preparations and unlikely to be localized in all three subcellular structures . to localize _PROTEIN_ a translational fusion to green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ was made transformed into _PROTEIN_ plants and shown to complement the phenotypes conferred by the _PROTEIN_ mutant . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was localized to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ no _METHOD_ signal was associated with chloroplasts . after inoculation with b. g. hordei _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ accumulated to high levels in regions of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ just under fungal appressoria in the shape of compact disks surrounded by diffuse halos approximately the size of papillae . occasionally this disk of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signal was surrounded by a concentric circle of intense _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ label within the diffuse halo . closer inspection of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ at attempted entry sites revealed a three dimensional bubble like shape presumably reflecting the invagination of the plant _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ by the growing fungal penetration peg and newly developing haustorium . a funnel like structure which resembled a hollow tube and extended into the plant cell was sometimes observed at penetration sites at _PROTEIN_ stages . localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ after e. cichoracearum infection was similar to that observed after inoculation with b. g. hordei . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ accumulated in compact disks beneath appressoria as well as in diffuse halos around this domain and in bubble like structures . when e. cichoracearum haustoria were formed the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ marker was also observed partially surrounding the haustorium .
