regulation of homeotic gene _PROTEIN_ is critical for proper developmental patterns in both animals and plants . _PROTEIN_ is a key regulator of the arabidopsis floral homeotic gene _PROTEIN_ . mutations in _PROTEIN_ cause ectopic _PROTEIN_ mrna _PROTEIN_ in the outer two whorls of a flower leading to homeotic transformations of floral organ identity as well as loss of floral organs . we isolated the _PROTEIN_ gene by using a map based approach and showed that _PROTEIN_ encodes a glutamine rich protein with seven wd repeats and is similar in motif structure to a class of functionally related transcriptional corepressors including from yeast and groucho from drosophila . the _LOCATION_ localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ is consistent with a role of _PROTEIN_ as a transcriptional regulator . the detection of _PROTEIN_ mrna in all floral whorls at the time of their inception suggests that the restricted activity of _PROTEIN_ in the outer two floral whorls must depend on interactions with other spatially restricted _PROTEIN_ or on posttranslational regulation . our finding suggests that both animals and plants use similar repressor proteins to regulate critical developmental processes .
we isolated the _PROTEIN_ gene by positional cloning . the position of _PROTEIN_ on chromosome was established by using recombinant chromosomes and pcr based markers . a kb cosmid contig of cosmid clones was transformed into lug mutants to test for rescue of the mutant phenotype . lug a weak lug mutant with the highest fertility among all lug alleles allows the direct transformation of homozygous lug plants . two overlapping cosmid clones and g complemented the lug mutant as shown by the wild type flowers formed by both primary and secondary transgenic plants . the overlapping region of these two cosmids contains one gene that spans the genomic sequences from nucleotides to of cosmid whose sequence was released by the european union arabidopsis sequence consortium . three cdna clones residing in the overlapping region of the two cosmids were isolated by screening cdna libraries . rapid amplification of cdna ends was used to identify the sequences of the mrna . sequence analyses of five lug mutant alleles all revealed single base changes in this gene . lug and lug mutants both exhibit strong phenotypes and both possess a c to t change that results in a glutamine to a stop codon near the terminus . northern analyses of lug mrna revealed that the level of lug transcript is only at about of the wild type level indicating that the premature termination of translation may have caused a reduced stability of the lug transcript . lug causes a g to a change at the splicing acceptor site of the third exon . this single base substitution apparently alters splicing as shown by a reduced size of lug transcript . however the level of the abnormally spliced lug transcript is increased to about of wild type level . one possible explanation may be that _PROTEIN_ is involved in repressing its own transcription and that an increased _PROTEIN_ mrna level is seen only in those lug mutants that do not suffer from premature translational termination . the intermediate strength lug mutation causes a g to a change at the splicing acceptor site of the eighth exon . sequence analyses of reverse transcription pcr products indicated that the lug transcript uses an alternative splice acceptor site only one base to the original site . this results in a frame shift followed by new amino acids and then a stop . northern analyses revealed that the level of the lug transcript is reduced to of wild type level probably because of the premature translational termination . finally the strong lug mutation inserts an a and changes the last amino acids of the protein . these data indicated that we had isolated the _PROTEIN_ gene . based on the _PROTEIN_ cdna and rapid amplification of cdna ends the _PROTEIN_ gene encodes a protein of aa . near the terminus of _PROTEIN_ two q rich regions are identified . the first q rich region contains qs including three uninterrupted stretches of and . the second q rich region contains qs . the _PROTEIN_ terminus of the protein contains seven wd repeats . finally the region between the q rich and the wd repeats is rich in serine glycine leucine and proline . blast search revealed an arabidopsis chromosome gene with the highest sequence similarity to _PROTEIN_ . this homolog of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ exhibits overall sequence identity to _PROTEIN_ . the presence of several arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ sequence tag clones indicates that _PROTEIN_ is an _PROTEIN_ gene . the terminal aa of _PROTEIN_ show identity to _PROTEIN_ . this high level of conservation suggests that the terminal aa may define an important functional domain . database search with the terminal aa revealed and sequence identity to the yeast gene and a human single strand dna binding protein respectively . thus we named this conserved domain lufs _PROTEIN_ which is also present in genes of unknown function in _METHOD_ such as schizosaccharomyces pombe drosophila and caenorhabditis elegans . the functional nature of this domain is unknown . the second motif of _PROTEIN_ that shows sequence similarities to other proteins in databases is the wd repeat . among wd repeat containing proteins the yeast transcriptional corepressor exhibits additional levels of similarity to _PROTEIN_ . protein shows overall sequence identity to _PROTEIN_ . like _PROTEIN_ protein has q rich regions near the terminus and seven wd repeats at the _PROTEIN_ terminus . however has a unique terminal domain of aa which bears no sequence similarity to the lufs domain of _PROTEIN_ . belongs a class of functionally related transcriptional corepressors including drosophila gro which also possesses a terminal q rich region and _PROTEIN_ terminal wd repeats . because lug mutants exhibit defects in both reproductive and vegetative tissues we examined _PROTEIN_ mrna _PROTEIN_ in different plant tissues and organs by northern blots . we found that _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ in all tissues tested including roots shoots _METHOD_ cauline leaves and inflorescences . the _PROTEIN_ level is highest in inflorescences that contain flowers at all stages . the broad mrna _PROTEIN_ profile of _PROTEIN_ is consistent with a role of _PROTEIN_ in regulating multiple developmental processes . to identify transcriptional regulators of _PROTEIN_ we examined _PROTEIN_ mrna _PROTEIN_ in several floral homeotic mutants including pistillata and ag and in floral meristem identity mutant leafy . using mrnas isolated from floral tissues we found that with the exception of ag _PROTEIN_ mrna level appeared unchanged in all of the mutants tested . in the ag mutants however _PROTEIN_ mrna level is slightly reduced . because the ag mutant flowers do not form any stamens and carpels which _PROTEIN_ high levels of _PROTEIN_ mrna it is not surprising that _PROTEIN_ mrna appeared reduced in the ag mutants . in situ hybridization was used to examine further the _PROTEIN_ mrna _PROTEIN_ pattern in young day old seedlings and during flower development . a low level of _PROTEIN_ mrna was detected both in shoot apical _METHOD_ and inflorescence _METHOD_ . _PROTEIN_ mrna level is low in the first few young leaf primordia in seedlings but increases rapidly in older leaves . in cauline leaves of bolted plants _PROTEIN_ mrna is more abundant at the adaxial side of the leaves . in _METHOD_ and carpel valves _PROTEIN_ mrna is prominently _PROTEIN_ in the vascular tissues . because one of the most important function of _PROTEIN_ is to repress _PROTEIN_ rna _PROTEIN_ in the outer two whorls of a flower we tested whether _PROTEIN_ rna is _PROTEIN_ only in the outer two floral whorls . we found that _PROTEIN_ mrna is detected in all four floral whorls at the time of their inception . _PROTEIN_ is highly _PROTEIN_ in the entire stage floral primordia and in young floral organ primordia _PROTEIN_ . thus the ability of _PROTEIN_ to repress _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in the outer two whorls must depend on either posttranslational regulation or interaction with other spatially restricted regulators . during _PROTEIN_ stages of flower development _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ subsides from sepals and is detected in the developing stamen and carpel primordia . interestingly the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ persists until at least stage . in addition _PROTEIN_ mrna is found prominently in the placenta/ovules and in locules of anthers . this high level of _PROTEIN_ mrna _PROTEIN_ during both female and male gamete development suggests that _PROTEIN_ plays an important role in ovule and pollen development and is consistent with the observed abnormality in lug female and male fertility . if _PROTEIN_ functions as a transcriptional regulator _PROTEIN_ protein should be located in the _LOCATION_ . however _PROTEIN_ does not appear to encode any obvious _LOCATION_ localization signal . to determine the subcellular location of _PROTEIN_ we made a fusion protein between _PROTEIN_ and the _METHOD_ . a full length _PROTEIN_ cdna was inserted _PROTEIN_ terminal to the _METHOD_ and the fusion construct was transiently _PROTEIN_ in onion epidermal cells . the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion protein localizes to the _LOCATION_ of onion epidermal cells whereas _METHOD_ alone localizes to both cytoplasm and _LOCATION_ . the _LOCATION_ localization of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ supports _PROTEIN_ as a transcriptional regulator .
lug and lug have been described . lug and lug are ethyl methanesulfonate _METHOD_ induced mutation in the landsberg _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ background . lug is a ds transposon induced allele in l _LOCATION_ . two mapping populations were screened to identify recombinant chromosomes in or by using the genetic markers _PROTEIN_ and that flank _PROTEIN_ at and map units respectively . a _PROTEIN_ allele in wassilewskija ecotype was crossed into lug in l _LOCATION_ ecotype . families and families were screened for segregating _PROTEIN_ lug double mutants in . these double mutants were used for subsequent fine mapping . a second mapping population was similarly constructed by crossing an mutant in columbia ecotype with lug in l _LOCATION_ ecotype . fifteen recombinants between _PROTEIN_ and lug and recombinants between and lug were further screened with cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence markers shown in fig . fig refa . the caps markers and flank lug with one recombinant on each side . information for these markers is at http . the region from to is covered by the yeast artificial chromosome clone and five overlapping bacterial artificial chromosome clones . a cosmid library was made from the yac and the binary cosmid transformation vector . the procedure is essentially the same as described . cosmid clones were isolated by screening the cosmid library with each of the five bac clones as probes . the cosmid contig which spans kb was constructed by using restriction enzyme analyses . a total of cosmids were transformed into the weak and fertile lug mutants via agrobacterium strain and vacuum infiltration . complementation rescue by the and g cosmid clones was observed by the wild type primary transgenic plants and subsequently was verified in the next generation by cosegregation of the rescued plants with corresponding cosmid clones . three _PROTEIN_ cdna clones were isolated by screening a total of plaques from two cdna libraries weigel l _LOCATION_ flower library and kieber and ecker columbia cdna library . a rapid amplification of cdna ends kit version _PROTEIN_ was used to identify the sequence of _PROTEIN_ mrna . three nested primers from the gene specific region of _PROTEIN_ cdna were used . they are tctcattggtcctagc ccagaagacagaccaccactc and caggtgcgtcaatagcaactg . the pcr products were cloned into pgem t vector and sequenced . for northern analyses poly rna was isolated from respective tissues by using the fasttrack rna isolation system . both root and shoot mrna was isolated from the same day old seedlings . mrna from the _METHOD_ cauline leaves and inflorescences was isolated from the same day old plants that had just bolted . mrna from the lug lug and lug was isolated from inflorescences of day old plants . a total of poly rna was loaded per lane and fractionated in a agarose gel . the northern filters were probed with the bp _PROTEIN_ cdna sequence . the actin probe is a kb actin cdna from brassica oleracea . the northern images were generated by using a cyclone storage phosphor system and quantitated by using optiquant image analysis software . the in situ sense and antisense probes were derived from a bp ecorv/sspi fragment from the untranslated region of _PROTEIN_ which was cloned into the psk vector . the probes were labeled with digoxigenin utp as described and the fixation and hybridization procedure was based on www.wisc.edu/genetics/catg/barton/protocols.html . a full length _PROTEIN_ cdna was pcr amplified with primers gagatctatgtctcagaccaactg and taagatcttcgtcagatcatacaacaac by using the platinum high fidelity taq polymerase _PROTEIN_ . the amplified fragment was cloned into the pgem t vector and sequenced . full length _PROTEIN_ cdna in the pgem t vector was digested with bglii and cloned into the vector . the resulting plasmid construct verified by sequence analyses carries an in frame fusion of _PROTEIN_ to the _PROTEIN_ terminus of _METHOD_ . transient _PROTEIN_ assays in onion epidermal cells were carried out by using a biolistic particle delivery system and the tissues were visualized and photographed as described . images were obtained with a objective and a nikon mm camera .
