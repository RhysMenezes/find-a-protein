phosphatidylserine decarboxylase is involved in the synthesis of the abundant phospholipid phosphatidylethanolamine particularly in mitochondria in many _METHOD_ including yeast and animals . arabidopsis contains three genes with sequence similarity to ps decarboxylases and the respective gene products were functionally characterized after heterologous _PROTEIN_ in yeast and escherichia coli . while the _PROTEIN_ protein localizes to mitochondria _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are found in the endomembrane system . to study the role of _PROTEIN_ genes in plant phospholipid metabolism arabidopsis insertional mutants for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were obtained . the single mutants were _PROTEIN_ in ps decarboxylase activity to various extents but mutant plants showed no obvious growth or morphological phenotype . a triple mutant _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was generated that was totally devoid of ps decarboxylase activity . while the phospholipid composition in whole leaves was unchanged the pe content in isolated mitochondria of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ . therefore the predominant proportion of pe in arabidopsis is synthesized by alternative pathways but a significant amount of mitochondrial pe is derived from the ps decarboxylase reaction . these results imply that similar to yeast and animal cells a specific phospholipid transfer from the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ to mitochondria exists in plants .
in many eukaryotic _METHOD_ mitochondrial ps decarboxylase is involved in the synthesis of a major proportion of cellular pe . mitochondrial ps decarboxylases were identified in yeast chinese _METHOD_ tomato and arabidopsis . furthermore bacterial ps decarboxylases with close sequence similarity to mitochondrial _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were identified in e. coli and b. subtilis . yeast contains a second ps decarboxylase _PROTEIN_ that localizes to the _LOCATION_ and harbors a long n terminal extension . in addition to _PROTEIN_ the genomic sequence of arabidopsis contains two further loci with sequence similarity to ps decarboxylases _GENE_ and _GENE_ which were tentatively designated _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . the predicted amino acid sequences of these genes were very similar and more related to the yeast _PROTEIN_ protein than to the mitochondrial _PROTEIN_ proteins from plants or other _METHOD_ . furthermore similar to yeast _PROTEIN_ the two arabidopsis proteins _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ contained long n terminal extensions . to functionally characterize the putative ps decarboxylases _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ from arabidopsis the respective cdnas were heterologously _PROTEIN_ in psd mutants of yeast and e. coli . a yeast double mutant _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ deficient in both _PROTEIN_ genes is unable to synthesize pe via the ps decarboxylase pathway . this mutant is auxotroph for ethanolamine because pe can be synthesized from ethanolamine via the kennedy pathway . transformation of the yeast _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutant with plasmids harboring the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ cdnas restored growth on ethanolamine free medium indicating that these two sequences encode functional ps decarboxylases . an alternative strategy to study ps decarboxylase activity is the complementation of the e. coli mutant which carries a temperature sensitive mutation in its single psd gene . to address the question whether the c terminal part of _PROTEIN_ carrying the ps decarboxylase sequence domain is sufficient to encode a functionally active enzyme the entire _PROTEIN_ cdna or its c terminal part was transferred into the e. coli mutant . proteins were isolated from the mutant carrying the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ constructs and ps decarboxylase activity measured at with radioactively labeled ps . figure shows that ps decarboxylase activity in cells transformed with an empty vector or with the full length arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ cdna was low as compared to cells harboring the n terminally truncated form . therefore the c terminal _PROTEIN_ like part of arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ encodes a functionally active ps decarboxylase and the long n terminal is not required for enzymatic activity but has an inhibitory effect when _PROTEIN_ in e. coli . the _PROTEIN_ that the two arabidopsis ps decarboxylases _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ contain a long n terminal extension might suggest that these two proteins do not localize to mitochondria . the full length sequences of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were n terminally fused to the sequence of the _METHOD_ and transiently _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis leaves . as a control a _METHOD_ fusion construct of the mitochondrial ps decarboxylase _PROTEIN_ from arabidopsis was employed . analysis by confocal microscopy and comparison to control constructs revealed that the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein accumulated in mitochondria in agreement with previous results . in contrast the localization pattern of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ gpf fusion proteins was different . for _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ a colocalization experiment was done of a red _METHOD_ protein fusion with a tonoplast control protein . the green and red _METHOD_ of the two proteins was largely overlapping indicating that _PROTEIN_ localizes to the tonoplast . furthermore comparison of the _METHOD_ of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ construct with that of a _METHOD_ fusion with an _LOCATION_ control protein revealed that _PROTEIN_ most likely localizes to the _LOCATION_ . therefore the two ps decarboxylases _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were localized to endomembrane fraction presumably to the tonoplast and _LOCATION_ respectively . _PROTEIN_ of ps decarboxylase genes in different plant organs was analyzed by northern hybridization and semiquantitative pcr analysis . in agreement with previous results the mitochondrial _PROTEIN_ was found to be _PROTEIN_ in roots and to a lesser extent in _METHOD_ and leaves . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was highest in flowers but very low in siliques . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was comparable in roots _METHOD_ leaves and flowers but very low in siliques . because of the high sequence similarity with _PROTEIN_ and the low _PROTEIN_ level it was not possible to detect _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ by northern hybridization . therefore a specific _PROTEIN_ primer pair was designed for semiquantitative reverse transcription pcr to distinguish between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mrna _PROTEIN_ . as shown in figure _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was highest in flowers and lower in leaves . _PROTEIN_ in roots shoots and siliques was very low when measured by rt pcr . to study the role of ps decarboxylase in plant lipid metabolism a reverse genetic approach was chosen . to this end t dna insertion mutant lines for the three _PROTEIN_ genes were selected from different arabidopsis mutant populations . one mutant line _PROTEIN_ was found in the salk population . screening of the madison t dna insertion population resulted in the identification of two mutant lines _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . two additional mutant alleles _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were obtained from syngenta . sequencing of pcr fragments revealed that the insertions in all mutant plants are localized in exons or introns between the start and stop codons . homozygous lines for all mutant alleles were identified by pcr segregation analysis and southern blot hybridization using genomic _PROTEIN_ fragments as probes . _PROTEIN_ mrna abundance in psd mutants was analyzed to unravel whether there still was residual _PROTEIN_ . for _PROTEIN_ northern hybridization was done with total rna from flowers because _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was high in flowers . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in the _PROTEIN_ mutant was not detectable in contrast to wild type where a clear band was identified . northern hybridization of leaf rna revealed that one band corresponding to _PROTEIN_ was detectable in wild type but this band was absent from the _PROTEIN_ mutant . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was analyzed by rt pcr of leaf rna and pcr fragments separated by agarose gel electrophoresis . a band for _PROTEIN_ was observed in wild type but this band was absent from _PROTEIN_ . in conclusion the mrna of the respective _PROTEIN_ genes was shown to be absent from the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutant lines indicating that these insertion lines represent null alleles . growth and morphology of the different mutant lines was indistinguishable from the respective wild type ecotypes indicating that single mutations in _PROTEIN_ genes have no effect on overall plant physiology . to address the question whether the different ps decarboxylase _METHOD_ are functionally redundant double mutants were generated by crosses between the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ as well as the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutant lines . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ share a high degree of sequence similarity and the two proteins localize to the endomembrane system suggesting that they might have redundant functions . however similar to the psd single mutants growth and morphology of the two double mutant lines _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were very similar to wild type . to obtain plants carrying t dna insertions in all three ps decarboxylase genes triple mutant lines _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were generated by crossing the double mutant lines _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ with the _PROTEIN_ single mutant . growth of the two lines _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was not different from wild type . ps decarboxylase activity was measured in microsomal _LOCATION_ isolated from leaves . the enzyme activities in wild type _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were very similar indicating that the _PROTEIN_ enzyme is responsible for only a minor fraction of the total ps decarboxylase activity in leaves . this is in agreement with the low _PROTEIN_ level of _PROTEIN_ . microsomal _PROTEIN_ activities in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant were _PROTEIN_ to about one third of wild type activity . therefore _PROTEIN_ represents the major ps decarboxylase activity in arabidopsis leaves . _PROTEIN_ activity in microsomal fractions of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ triple mutant was below detection limit . the residual amount of _PROTEIN_ activity found in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant is derived from _PROTEIN_ suggesting that the microsomal fraction contained some mitochondrial _LOCATION_ . the complete absence of _PROTEIN_ activity from the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ triple mutant is in agreement with the assumption that this mutant plant carries three null mutations in the _PROTEIN_ genes and that arabidopsis contains no other _LOCATION_ associated protein capable of decarboxylating ps . mitochondria were isolated from dark grown seedlings and employed for _PROTEIN_ activity assays . _PROTEIN_ activity in mitochondria of the _PROTEIN_ mutant was _PROTEIN_ to less than of wild type activity . the very low activity in _PROTEIN_ mitochondria presumably is derived from _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ activities still associated with the mitochondrial preparation . ps decarboxylase activity was shown to be required for the synthesis of a large proportion of pe in yeast and animals . therefore a block in _PROTEIN_ gene _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis mutants was expected to affect the pe content particularly in mitochondria possibly accompanied with an increase of the substrate ps . total lipids were isolated from leaves of wild type and the single double and triple mutant lines _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and after separation via two dimensional thin layer chromatography quantified by gas chromatography of fatty acid methyl esters . lipid contents were unchanged in all lines analyzed . therefore partial or total deficiency in _PROTEIN_ activity in arabidopsis mutants has no measurable effect on pe synthesis in leaves . the contents of phospholipids in leaves are considerably low because leaves are rich in galactolipids . therefore lipid analysis of nongreen plant organs that contain higher proportions of phospholipids might reveal small differences in phospholipid composition that would not be detectable in leaves . _LOCATION_ lipid composition of flowers of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ triple mutant was also not changed as compared to wild type . fatty acid composition of pe and ps in plants is characterized by a high proportion of linoleic acid and linolenic acid . however ps isolated from the _LOCATION_ or the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ of plants was shown to be enriched in very long chain fatty acids i.e . docosanoic acid and tetracosanoic acid . fatty acid composition of pe and ps isolated from whole leaves or flowers in wild type and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was very similar suggesting that total deficiency in ps decarboxylase activity did not affect incorporation of lipid precursors from different pools into pe or ps . fatty acid composition of pe and ps in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ triple mutant lipids were isolated from leaves or flowers separated by two dimensional tlc from wild type or _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and quantified by gc of fatty acid methyl esters . data are given in mol and represent mean sd of three measurements . very long chain fatty acids were only detected in ps but were absent from pe and all other _LOCATION_ lipids analyzed . in yeast mitochondria represent an essential site for pe synthesis via the ps decarboxylase pathway . to elucidate the role of ps decarboxylase in plants for mitochondrial pe synthesis mitochondria were isolated from dark grown seedlings of the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ triple mutant and employed for lipid analysis . the amount of pe was slightly _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ and it was even further reduced in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . concomitantly the amount of ps was increased in mitochondria of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ .
