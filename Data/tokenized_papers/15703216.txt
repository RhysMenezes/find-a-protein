rho _PROTEIN_ regulate the actin _LOCATION_ exocytosis endocytosis and other signaling cascades . rhos are subdivided into four subfamilies designated rho racs and a plant specific group designated _PROTEIN_ . this research demonstrates that ectopic _PROTEIN_ of a constitutive active arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ disrupts actin _LOCATION_ organization and _LOCATION_ cycling . we created transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ either wild type or constitutive active _PROTEIN_ fused to the green _METHOD_ protein . the activated _PROTEIN_ induced deformation of root hairs and leaf epidermal cells and was primarily localized in triton x insoluble fractions of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . actin _LOCATION_ reorganization was revealed by creating double transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ activated _PROTEIN_ and the actin marker _METHOD_ talin . plants were further analyzed by _LOCATION_ staining with n pyridinium dibromide under different treatments including the protein trafficking inhibitor brefeldin a or the actin depolymeryzing agents latrunculin b and cytochalasin d . after drug treatments activated _PROTEIN_ did not accumulate in brefeldin a compartments but rather reduced their number and colocalized with labeled _LOCATION_ in large intracellular vesicles . furthermore endocytosis was compromised in root hairs of activated _PROTEIN_ transgenic plants . was endocytosed in nontransgenic root hairs treated with the actin stabilizing drug jasplakinolide . these findings suggest complex regulation of _LOCATION_ cycling by plant _PROTEIN_ .
ectopic _PROTEIN_ of constitutive active _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion protein _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ induced morphological changes in leaf shape . leaves of _PROTEIN_ plants were narrower than wild type control and folded downward . the structure of leaves _PROTEIN_ a wt _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was similar to that of wt untransformed plants . next we examined weather the changes in leaf structure reflected altered cell morphogenesis . cells of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ transgenic plants had abnormal structures . epidermal cells lost their lobing . the palisade mesophyll cells became isomorphic rather than elongated along the adaxial abaxial axis and air spaces were smaller in the spongy mesophyll . these changes made it difficult to discriminate between the palisade and spongy mesophyll in cross sections . epidermal cells from plants _PROTEIN_ a wild type _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ a dominant negative _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or nonexpressing cells from _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ partially silenced plants in which only a subset of the cells _PROTEIN_ the recombinant protein were similar to cells of wild type plants . the analysis of the partially silenced plants also showed that the loss of lobing in the epidermal cells was directly correlated to the level of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in the cells . the data presented in figure indicated that the changes in cell morphology were induced by the _PROTEIN_ of the constitutive active form of _PROTEIN_ . to further study the function of _PROTEIN_ its subcellular localization was investigated . previously we have shown that _PROTEIN_ is attached to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ by virtue of its palmitoylation on two c terminal cysteines . when palmitoylation was inhibited _PROTEIN_ accumulated in the _LOCATION_ due to a polybasic domain located proximal to its c terminal end . unlike other type ii _PROTEIN_ a fraction of _PROTEIN_ was often located in the _LOCATION_ . when plant tissues are incubated in high concentration osmoticum solutions such as glycerol or mannitol water exits cells due to differences in water potential . in this process designated plasmolysis the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ is detached from the cell wall and the cytoplasm and _LOCATION_ shrink but cell walls stay intact _PROTEIN_ overall cell structure . after plasmolysis _METHOD_ labeled _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ is detected as thin lines that are detached from the cell wall and the _LOCATION_ becomes visible using nomarsky differential interference contrast . after plasmolysis of either leaf epidermal cells or swollen root hairs _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ remained attached to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and no perinuclear and transvacuolar cytoplasmic strands that would have indicated vaulor _LOCATION_ localization were detected . for comparison after _PROTEIN_ of free _METHOD_ the protein was detected as a _PROTEIN_ patchy line circumventing the cell in cytoplasmic strands and _LOCATION_ . after plasmolysis _METHOD_ accumulated in larger patches . this contrasts the _LOCATION_ bound _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ which showed as a sharp fluorescing line before and after plasmolysis . occasionally elongated root hairs _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ had swellings that were associated with accumulation of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ protein . to substantiate _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ localization at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and obtain further insight into its possible functions total protein extracts were analyzed by _LOCATION_ flotation centrifugation assays . in these assays the protein extract is placed at the bottom of a sucrose density gradient . after centrifugal separation _LOCATION_ float and the soluble fraction remains at the bottom of the gradient . in _LOCATION_ flotation centrifugation assays _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was detected in the third and fourth fractions from the top of the gradient . this localization in the gradient which corresponds to the border between and sucrose was expected for _LOCATION_ attached proteins . the soluble protein fraction which in plants is characterized by a major kda band of the large subunit of ribulose biphosphate _PROTEIN_ oxygenase enzyme complex remained at the bottom of the gradient . further experiments were carried out to verify whether _PROTEIN_ could be extracted out of the _LOCATION_ by triton x . protein extracts from _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ plants were fractionated into soluble and insoluble fractions . the insoluble fraction was fractionated into triton x soluble and insoluble fractions . in turn the triton x insoluble fraction was solubilized with _PROTEIN_ . the results show that the majority of the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ protein existed in the insoluble fraction with most protein in the triton x insoluble fraction . control experiments with a known _LOCATION_ protein were used to verify that the inability to extract _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ by triton x did not result from the experimental system . _PROTEIN_ is a highly hydrophobic _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ localized amino acid transporter containing putative transmembrane domains . protein extracts prepared from _PROTEIN_ transgenic plants were fractionated into soluble and insoluble fractions . in turn the insoluble fraction was solubilized with triton x . although no _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ protein was detected in the soluble fraction the fusion protein was extracted from the _LOCATION_ by triton x . the same _PROTEIN_ system and buffers were used to _PROTEIN_ and extract _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ indicating that the inability to solubilize _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ with tritonx was not a result from the experimental conditions . the partitioning of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ between triton x soluble and insoluble _LOCATION_ suggested that this protein might be fractionated into specific _LOCATION_ microdomains . more experiments were carried out to study the function of _PROTEIN_ at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . changes in plant cell morphology induced by activated _PROTEIN_ were previously associated with actin reorganization . to determine whether _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ induced reorganization in actin _LOCATION_ transgenic arabidopsis lines _PROTEIN_ the f actin binding domain of mouse tn fused to _METHOD_ _METHOD_ were created . the _METHOD_ tn transgenic lines were carefully selected to ensure that the _PROTEIN_ of the transgene did not induce new phenotypes . three independent _METHOD_ tn lines were crossed into _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ background to obtain double transgenic plants . in root hairs of col _METHOD_ tn plants the actin bundles were organized parallel to long axis of the cell . fine mesh but no actin bundles were observed under the tip of growing root hairs . more actin bundles were observed in swollen root hairs of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ tn plants . these actin filaments were organized at different angles often arranging as a band oriented at a right angle to the original elongation axis of the root hair . the arrangement of the actin bundles circumventing the swollen root hair became clear by a angle tilt of a three dimensional projection of the image . to view both _METHOD_ tn and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ markers samples were excited with argon laser at nm and the _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ signals were separated using a channel dye separation algorithm . although some of the _METHOD_ signal was lost during this procedure the _METHOD_ signal was detected at the cell surface and the _METHOD_ signal was detected _PROTEIN_ in the cortical region . similar results were obtained when the _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ signals were resolved using a spectral dye separation algorithm after a scan with the spectral detector of leica tcs sl confocal microscope . in yeast and animal _METHOD_ rho _PROTEIN_ have been reported to affect endocytosis and exocytose by actin dependent and independent _METHOD_ . plant _PROTEIN_ have recently been suggested to play critical roles in regulation of vesicle trafficking but the _METHOD_ of their action are still unknown . moreover the effects of plant _PROTEIN_ on _LOCATION_ dynamics have not been addressed . as in axonal growth root hair elongation requires the _PROTEIN_ movement of vesicles that add the necessary substances and _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ components by fusing at the cell 's growing tip . _PROTEIN_ regulate _LOCATION_ vesicle movement in two major ways first vesicle movement depends on f actin the dynamic of which is regulated by _PROTEIN_ . second _PROTEIN_ may regulate vesicle movement by using _METHOD_ not directly related with the _LOCATION_ . to examine whether _PROTEIN_ influence vesicular transport _LOCATION_ were visualized with the lipophilic dye a common probe used for detection of _LOCATION_ endocytosis . when wt seedlings were submerged in solution the dye was internalized immediately . movies prepared from a time lapse series of the same cell consisting of scans taken every s for min depicted the cytoplasmic streaming and the internalization of into the root hair . the majority of root hairs of the wt _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ transgenic plants were similar to root hairs of untransformed plants . in these root hairs was internalized like in untransformed plants . movies prepared from time lapse series of similar root hairs showed the cytoplasmic streaming and endocytosis of . approximately of root hairs of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ plants were partially swollen . in these root hairs internalization of was barely detectable and most of the dye stayed on the _LOCATION_ . movies prepared from a time lapse series of scans taken every s for min depicted the cytoplasmic streaming and steady but slow internalization of into the root hair . was not internalized in swollen root hairs _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ remaining instead on the _LOCATION_ . most of the dye remained in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ even after min incubation at room temperature . movies prepared from a time lapse series of scans taken every s for min showed that although cytoplasmic streaming continued only very little was internalized and most of the dye remained on the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . this result suggested that the inhibition of internalization was not associated with cessation of cytoplasmic streaming . to illustrate the distribution of _METHOD_ and markers in the wt col and transgenic plants signal intensities were quantified . the plots represent distribution of signal intensity per micrometer in _METHOD_ and channels in the line defined in the inset of each graph . the insets in a b c and d correspond to figure b e h and n respectively . the plots provide quantitative illustration to internalization of and colocalization of the two signals . collectively these data suggested a correlation between the localization of activated _PROTEIN_ at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ root hair swelling and inhibition of vesicle internalization . recent results indicate that actin turnover is required for root hair and plant cell growth . _PROTEIN_ induced actin reorganization and _PROTEIN_ have been shown to inhibit adf/cofillin that is required for actin turnover . to examine whether actin stabilization inhibited endocytosis of seedling were treated with the actin stabilizing drug jasplakinolide . jasplakinolide stabilizes actin by preventing filament disassembly both in vitro and in vivo and induces actin polymerization in a concentration dependent manner by increasing actin nucleation . additionally jasplakinolide has been shown to be highly cell permeate in both animal and plant cells . aggregation and increase in _PROTEIN_ of actin bundles were detected in jasplakinolide treated yft tn root hairs whereas no effect was detected in control plants incubated in methanol . was internalized into jasplkinolide treated root hairs and accumulated in intracellular bodies reflecting the perturbation to the actin _LOCATION_ . thus unlike the effects of _PROTEIN_ which inhibited internalization of jasplakinolide interfered with intracellular vesicle cycling but not with internalization from the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . next we sought to determine whether _PROTEIN_ activity altered vesicle cycling directly rather then indirectly by processes such as growth inhibition . to this end cells of wild type and _PROTEIN_ plants were visualized after disruption of the balance between endocytosis and exocytosis . unless exocytosis is inhibited vesicle movement between the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and endosomes is often invisible due to its speed . to inhibit exocytosis and render movement visible cells were treated bfa . bfa a specific inhibitor of adp ribosylation _PROTEIN_ gef arrests vesicle trafficking at various points along the secretory pathway . bfa treatments induce intracellular accumulation of different _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ proteins sterols and of cell wall components . on treatment of wild type roots with bfa stained _LOCATION_ accumulated in intracellular bodies known as bfa bodies/compartments . similarly under the experimental condition used in this study labeled _LOCATION_ accumulated in bfa compartments after treatments of roots from wild type seedlings with bfa . similar numbers of bfa bodies formed in root cells of bfa treated _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ plants . much fewer bfa bodies were visible in bfa treated _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ roots . moreover the bfa bodies were only stained by and not with _METHOD_ . quantitative analysis of bfa body numbers in wt and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and eight _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ seedlings confirmed that their number was significantly lower in the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ roots . quantification of signal intensities/pixel of the bfa bodies indicated that almost all the _METHOD_ came from the but not the _METHOD_ . the maximum intensity projection stack image revealed that the labeling of bfa bodies with and not with _METHOD_ did not result from imaging of certain focal planes . there were several interpretations to the results . _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ might have resided in _LOCATION_ compartments that did not accumulate in bfa bodies . alternatively the ectopic _PROTEIN_ of the activated _PROTEIN_ disrupted vesicle accumulation in bfa bodies . the latter explanation was supported by data showing that bfa causes intracellular accumulation of different proteins and _LOCATION_ components . more experiments were carried out to clarify this point . when root hairs were examined a slightly different picture emerged . in wild type root hairs staining disappeared from the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and many intracellular bodies were visible after bfa application . a similar picture emerged after bfa treatments of plants _PROTEIN_ the wt _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ where intracellular bodies stained with both and _METHOD_ occurred . in the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ root hairs stained bodies were visible but in addition large vesicles measuring up to in diameter emanating from the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ formed . in contrast to the bfa bodies in which only _METHOD_ was visible the large vesicles were positive for and _METHOD_ signals . these unique large vesicles suggested that _PROTEIN_ disrupted vesicle cycling and inhibited the formation of bfa bodies . as shown in figure like root hairs leaf epidermal cells of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ plants had distinct morphology . it was interesting to examine whether the _PROTEIN_ of activated the _PROTEIN_ affected _LOCATION_ dynamics in a similar manner in both root hairs and leaf epidermal cells . on treatment of wild type leaves with bfa accumulated inside the cells in two ways either cone shaped structures formed in cellular growth lobes or distinct bfa bodies were detected . inward movement of labeled _LOCATION_ in the cellular growth lobes was revealed by time lapse microscopy . similar results were obtained after bfa treatments of leaves taken from transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ the wt _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . in some _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ cells bfa induced formation of bfa bodies . similar to roots these bfa bodies mostly contained and no _METHOD_ signal indicating that _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ containing _LOCATION_ did not cycle into the bfa bodies . in other _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ epidermal cells large vesicles emanated from the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ measuring up to in diameter . similar to the root hair cells these large vesicles were stained by both and _METHOD_ implying colocalization of the two dyes . time lapse microscopy revealed small vesicles budding from the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and fusing into larger vesicles and fission of large vesicles from the _LOCATION_ . the results from bfa treatments of either root hairs or leaf epidermal cells suggested that the activated _PROTEIN_ disrupted vesicle cycling inhibiting their accumulation in bfa bodies and instead promoting formation of large _LOCATION_ vesicles . it has been shown that vesicle recycling between _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and endosomes could be inhibited by the acin depolymerizing agents cd and lat b . it was therefore interesting to examine whether the effect of actin depolymerizing agents would be similar to that of bfa and would provide an additional control for the bfa experiments . to verify the effectiveness of lat b and cd in our system transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ the actin marker _METHOD_ tn were treated with either drug . treatment with either lat b or cd induced complete depolymerization of both actin bundles and fine meshwork . leaves taken from wild type and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ transgenic plants were treated with lat b or cd . in wild type leaves either lat b or cd treatment induced intracellular accumulation of which was confined to growth lobes as in the case of bfa treatments . in _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ transgenic leaves lat b treatment induced the formation of vesicles emanating from the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ reaching up to in diameter . similar effects were obtained when _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ leaves were treated with cd . the results in figures and provide evidence that disruption of _LOCATION_ cycling by _PROTEIN_ could be revealed by both bfa treatment which inhibits the exocytic pathway and by the disassembly of actin which may block vesicular movement .
