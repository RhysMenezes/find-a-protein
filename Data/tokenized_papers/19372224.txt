chloroplasts are the sites of photosynthesis in plants and they contain their own multicopy requisite genome . chloroplasts are also major sites for production of reactive oxygen species which can damage essential components of the chloroplast including the chloroplast genome . compared with mitochondria in animals relatively little is known about the potential to repair oxidative dna damage in chloroplasts . here we provide evidence of dna glycosylase lyase/endonuclease activity involved in base excision repair of oxidized pyrimidines in chloroplast protein extracts of arabidopsis thaliana . three base excision repair components that might account for this activity were identified by bioinformatics . transient _PROTEIN_ of protein green _METHOD_ protein fusions showed that all three are targeted to the chloroplast and co localized with chloroplast dna in nucleoids . the glycosylase lyase/endonuclease activity of one of the endonuclease iii homologs _PROTEIN_ which had not previously been characterized was confirmed in vitro . t dna insertions in each of these genes were identified and the physiological and biochemical phenotypes of the single double and triple mutants were analyzed . this mutant analysis revealed the presence of a third glycosylase activity and potentially another pathway for repair of oxidative dna damage in chloroplasts .
chloroplasts were isolated from wild type arabidopsis leaves and a soluble chloroplast protein extract was prepared by a method used previously to determine nucleotide excision repair and possible ber activity in arabidopsis whole cell extracts . chloroplast protein preparations were enriched in a stromal marker protein _PROTEIN_ and were free of detectable contamination by _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and mitochondrial proteins as assessed by immunoblot analysis of marker proteins for each of these compartments . ber enzymatic activities targeted to tg lesions were detected in the chloroplast protein preparation using a plasmid nicking assay . a supercoiled plasmid dna substrate which had been treated with to generate tg lesions was incubated with the chloroplast protein extract and nicking of the sugar phosphate backbone by either bifunctional tg glycosylase lyase or tg glycosylase plus ap endonuclease activities resulted in the appearance of a relaxed open circular plasmid product of lower mobility in agarose gel electrophoresis . the activity was specific to dna that contained tg lesions because only a low level of nonspecific nicking activity was detected in the chloroplast extract using untreated control plasmid as substrate . candidate ber genes that might encode enzymes responsible for the activity detected in chloroplast extracts were initially selected by sequence similarity to known tg glycosylases . the arabidopsis genome has two nth homologs _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ but no recognizable nei homolog . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are homologous to their human and e. coli counterparts and they have identity and similarity to each other at the protein level . _PROTEIN_ has two splice variants that are described in data bases . the _GENE_ transcript retains a intron which introduces a stop codon prior to the conserved c terminal fe s domain . by rt pcr we identified a third splice variant that lacks the fifth exon . arabidopsis also has three genes that encode homologs of ap endonuclease enzymes from human _PROTEIN_ and e. coli . one of these _PROTEIN_ has been shown to have the predicted ap endonuclease activity in vitro . no homolog of the other e. coli ap endonuclease nfo is present in arabidopsis . subcellular localization of these candidate ber enzymes was predicted using six online prediction _METHOD_ for chloroplast targeting . chloroplast targeting predicted by at least three _METHOD_ was considered sufficient and on this basis _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were selected for further investigation . cdnas of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were cloned in frame with the green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ under the control of the strong constitutive promoter from cauliflower mosaic virus . the _METHOD_ fusion plasmids were transformed into arabidopsis protoplasts which were examined by confocal microscopy after overnight _PROTEIN_ . transient _PROTEIN_ of a _METHOD_ control plasmid showed _METHOD_ _METHOD_ in the _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ but _METHOD_ was clearly excluded from the chloroplasts . all three fusion proteins _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in a pattern similar to each other . in each case the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ co localized with the chlorophyll _METHOD_ and the visible structure of the chloroplast . moreover the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was seen in a distinct punctate pattern within the chloroplasts . dna staining of these live cells with dapi was difficult . however when the dapi staining was successful the _METHOD_ puncta clearly co localized with the dapi staining of chloroplast dna indicating that each of these proteins is not only chloroplast targeted but is associated with the chloroplast nucleoids . _PROTEIN_ was previously shown to have bifunctional glycosylase lyase activity in vitro but the enzymatic function of _PROTEIN_ has not been experimentally determined . to test whether _PROTEIN_ also has glycosylase lyase activity a cdna of the _GENE_ splice variant which includes the conserved c terminal fe s domain in the open reading frame was _PROTEIN_ in and purified from e. coli as a tagged protein . glycosylase lyase activity of _PROTEIN_ was assayed using tg containing plasmid dna as a substrate as described above for chloroplast proteins . the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ protein exhibited significant nicking activity specifically on treated substrate dna consistent with its predicted bifunctional tg glycosylase lyase activity whereas an eluate from an empty vector control showed essentially no activity . t dna insertional disruptions of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were obtained from either the salk collection or the sail/garlic collection and homozygous lines were identified by pcr . rt pcr was conducted to examine mrna accumulation in the homozygous mutants . the _PROTEIN_ and arp mutant lines were confirmed to lack their respective transcripts whereas the _PROTEIN_ mutant was found to _PROTEIN_ an _PROTEIN_ transcript at a reduced level . the homozygous lines were crossed with each other to create double mutants and the triple mutant . the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ arp triple mutant lacked _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mrnas but accumulated an intermediate level of _PROTEIN_ transcript . to determine whether the t dna insertion mutants affected the tg glycosylase lyase/endonuclease activity detected in wild type chloroplast extracts the tg plasmid nicking assay was performed with chloroplast proteins isolated from the single double and triple mutant lines . the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants did not affect this glycosylase lyase/endonuclease activity either independently or in their double mutant . the arp mutation however eliminated the activity alone and in double and triple mutant combinations . all mutants were screened for growth differences and whole plant phenotypes using a variety of measures and under a variety of growth conditions . photo oxidative stresses including high light hydrogen peroxide methyl viologen and uv light were imposed and parameters such as plant size weight lifetime seed production and photosynthetic efficiency were measured . no conditions yielded significant or reproducible differences in any measure even in the triple mutant .
arabidopsis lines were grown in growth chambers or in a greenhouse under standard conditions . plants were grown under long days on either sunshine mix or promix combined with vermiculite . plants were watered periodically with hoagland 's nutrient solution . t dna insertion lines were obtained from the arabidopsis biological resource center and backcrossed one to four times to wild type . the lines used were for _PROTEIN_ for _PROTEIN_ and sail for _PROTEIN_ . the double mutants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ arp were crossed to generate the triple mutant . for phenotypic analysis of

ncoi and sali restriction sites at the and ends respectively were amplified by pcr using primers _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and and _PROTEIN_ . the same primer _PROTEIN_ was used for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ because both cdnas were provided in the same puni plasmid . double digestion with ncoi and sali allowed ligation of the cdnas into the _METHOD_ plasmid in frame with the _METHOD_ and under the control of the promoter from cauliflower mosaic virus . for the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion the initiation codon of _METHOD_ was fused in frame one codon before the stop codon of the shorter splice variant thereby replacing a penultimate leucine with alanine and the terminal leucine with the methionine of _METHOD_ . in the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ construct the initiating methionine of _METHOD_ replaced a lysine three residues from the c terminus of _PROTEIN_ and the preceding serine became a threonine as a result of the cloning . the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion omitted the c terminal amino acid residues of _PROTEIN_ replacing a threonine with the _METHOD_ initial methionine and changing the preceding tyrosine to serine . protoplast isolation and transformation were done following the method of abdel ghany et al . with the following variations . plants were grown on soil and leaves were sliced into mm wide strips in sterile water then submerged and briefly vacuum

three primer pcr was carried out with two gene specific primers flanking the specific insertion site and one insert specific primer . the genotyping for the t dna insertion in _PROTEIN_ used two separate reactions each containing the right flanking primer and either the left flanking primer or the insert primer . primers were as follows salk insert left border _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ specific
