screening cdna libraries for genes encoding proteins that interact with a bait protein is usually performed in yeast . however subcellular compartmentation and protein modification may differ in yeast and plant cells resulting in misidentification of protein partners . we used bimolecular _METHOD_ complementation technology to screen a plant cdna library against a bait protein directly in plants . as proof of concept we used the n terminal fragment of yellow _METHOD_ protein or nvenus tagged agrobacterium tumefaciens and proteins and the c terminal extension domain of arabidopsis thaliana telomerase reverse transcriptase as baits to screen an arabidopsis cdna library encoding proteins tagged with the c terminal fragment of yellow _METHOD_ protein . a library of colonies representing cdnas was arrayed in well plates . dna was isolated from pools of plates individual plates and individual rows and columns of the plates . sequential screening of subsets of cdnas in arabidopsis leaf or tobacco bright yellow protoplasts identified single cdna clones encoding proteins that interact with either or both of the agrobacterium bait proteins or with cte . t dna insertions in the genes represented by some cdnas revealed five novel arabidopsis proteins important for agrobacterium mediated plant transformation . we also used this cdna library to confirm interacting proteins in orchid flowers . thus this technology can be applied to several plant species .
we chose bimolecular _METHOD_ complementation as a method to detect protein protein interactions in planta . this technique was initially developed to detect interaction of transcription _PROTEIN_ in animal cells . we and others subsequently _PROTEIN_ this assay system to investigate interaction of specific proteins in plant cells . however scientists have not previously used this system to screen a cdna library to identify unknown proteins encoded by these cdnas that interact with a specific bait protein . bifc is a peptide complementation assay in which _METHOD_ fragments of _METHOD_ proteins such as green _METHOD_ protein yellow _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ or their derivatives are fused in frame with test proteins . interaction of these test proteins may bring the _METHOD_ fragments into proximity such that they refold and restore _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . bifc is a sensitive assay that after generating the bait and prey clones requires only an efficient plant transformation system and a _METHOD_ imaging system such as an _METHOD_ or confocal microscope . as a transformation protocol we initially chose the tape arabidopsis sandwich leaf protoplast system . this protocol easily can be used to generate and transfect millions of high quality mesophyll protoplasts from virtually any arabidopsis genotype within a few hours . samples are imaged for bifc _METHOD_ the next day permitting rapid screening of dna from progressively more specific pools of cdna clones . supplemental figure online shows that this system is highly sensitive a _METHOD_ signal is easily detected after transformation of < ng of a cloned _METHOD_ gene under the control of a cauliflower mosaic virus double promoter into protoplasts . we next tested the sensitivity of this system for bifc using known protein protein interactors . during the process of agrobacterium mediated transformation protein is secreted through a type iv secretion system from the bacterium into plant cells . proteins can form multimers that aggregate in the plant cytoplasm often as perinuclear _PROTEIN_ . we observed that overexpression of genes by the camv double promoter could generate the c terminal fragment of cyan _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ and nvenus tagged peptides that generate nonspecific _METHOD_ complementation . we therefore _PROTEIN_ one of the fusion protein partners as an nvenus fusion from the relatively weak nopaline synthase promoter and the other fusion protein partner as a _METHOD_ fusion from the strong camv promoter _METHOD_ . we transformed bait protein dna into arabidopsis mesophyll protoplasts along with fold serial dilutions of prey protein dna . however in each transformation we kept the total amount of prey vector dna constant by adding empty vector prey dna _METHOD_ . serial dilution of specific prey dna by ev dna thus mimicked dilution of a specific interacting cdna clone among a population of noninteracting cdna clones and served as a reconstruction experiment to determine the extent to which we could detect a cdna encoding an interacting protein among cdnas encoding noninteracting proteins . figure shows that we could easily detect interaction of _METHOD_ encoded by ng of prey dna with nvenus encoded by of bait dna . these reconstruction experiments therefore indicate that we can detect an interacting protein encoded by < of transfected cdnas . in addition because the percentage of transfected protoplasts displaying a bifc signal _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ amounts of _METHOD_ prey dna but increasing amounts of _METHOD_ ev dna these experiments indicate that _PROTEIN_ of the bait protein from a gene under the control of the nopaline synthase promoter does not significantly generate a nonspecific bifc signal . we discuss below experiments to optimize bifc _METHOD_ signals between interacting bait and prey proteins while simultaneously minimizing bifc signals between noninteracting bait and prey proteins or between a bait protein and an ev construction . we repeated these reconstruction experiments using nvenus as the bait and an arabidopsis cdna clone encoding the interacting protein _GENE_ _PROTEIN_ . we diluted this cdna with another cdna encoding a protein that does not interact with . to quantify transformation efficiency and to mark cell _LOCATION_ we cotransfected a plasmid _PROTEIN_ monomeric red _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ . figure shows that we could detect a bifc _METHOD_ signal from a reaction in which the interacting cdna clone was diluted fold with a noninteracting cdna clone . having defined the sensitivity of the system we next used the tape arabidopsis sandwich protoplast system to screen an arabidopsis cdna library against nvenus as the bait protein . we recombined a normalized full length cdna library in the plasmid into the destination vector _PROTEIN_ dest _METHOD_ which tags proteins encoded by the cdnas at their n termini with the c terminal fragment of yellow _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ . following amplification of the library in such a way as to _PROTEIN_ normalization of the cdnas we extracted dna and cotransfected of library dna with of a clone encoding nvenus into arabidopsis leaf mesophyll protoplasts . using confocal microscopy we detected at low frequency yellow _METHOD_ cells . a majority of these cells showed cytoplasmic especially perinuclear _METHOD_ as previously detected in and _PROTEIN_ interactions . we occasionally detected _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ as previously seen with _PROTEIN_ interaction . to identify clones encoding specific proteins that interact with we arrayed cdna colonies into well microtiter plates . this initial arrayed library was used to screen for cdnas encoding proteins that interact with and and is currently _PROTEIN_ at the agricultural biotechnology research center . we extracted dna from pools of plates and used this dna in a bifc reaction with nvenus . we additionally cotransfected the cells with a construction _PROTEIN_ the fusion protein _METHOD_ . red _METHOD_ generated by this clone indicated transfected cells and was used to calculate the ratio of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ to red _METHOD_ . although we could see some weak yellow _METHOD_ signals from many of the pools dna from pool number yielded strong _METHOD_ signals and we therefore concentrated our initial efforts on identifying interacting cdnas from this pool . to this end we isolated dna from each of the plates comprising this pool and tested each of these dna plate pools against a clone _PROTEIN_ nvenus . several plates contained clones encoding proteins that interacted with to emit a weak yellow _METHOD_ signal . however in initial experiments dna from plate elicited a stronger bifc signal than did dna from other plates . we subsequently isolated dna from rows and columns of this plate and repeated the procedure . finally we isolated dna from specific colonies tested these clones against the nvenus _PROTEIN_ plasmid and sequenced individual cdna clones . supplemental figure online shows the results of these progressive enrichments for a particular clone _PROTEIN_ a protein that interacts with . these experiments indicated that plate contains five clones encoding four different proteins that strongly interact with . clone corresponds to _GENE_ _PROTEIN_ clone corresponds to _GENE_ clones and correspond to _GENE_ _PROTEIN_ and clone corresponds to _GENE_ . dna sequence analysis of these clones indicated that they encode full length open reading frames that are in frame with the n terminal _METHOD_ bifc tag . we next turned our attention to pool plate . protoplasts containing pooled cdna clones from this plate also showed strong bifc _METHOD_ signals when cotransfected with dna encoding nvenus . successive rounds of purification identified two different cdna clones each encoding the same s adenosyl l homocysteine hydrolase _PROTEIN_ . these clones similarly encode open reading frames in frame with the _METHOD_ tag . _PROTEIN_ protein also known as _PROTEIN_ is involved in dna methylation and homology dependent gene silencing . induction of the agrobacterium virulence regulon by plant phenolic molecules results in the synthesis of a protein essential for virulence . nicks t dna border repeat sequences surrounding t dna and covalently attaches to the end of the resulting t strand . subsequently pilots t strands through the type iv secretion apparatus into the plant and within the plant cell directs t strands to the _LOCATION_ . may also play a role in t dna integration into the plant genome . using yeast two hybrid and plant based bifc _METHOD_ scientists have identified several plant proteins that interact with . prominent among these plant proteins are members of the importin family which play a role in _LOCATION_ targeting of strand complexes and several different cyclophillin proteins whose role in transformation is not yet known . we used the n terminal fragment of yellow _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ as a bait to interrogate the arabidopsis _METHOD_ cdna arrayed library . to set imaging parameters we initially used importin _PROTEIN_ protein and the proteasome regulatory subunit as positive and negative prey controls respectively . supplemental figure online shows confocal microscopy images of arabidopsis protoplasts _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and each of these prey proteins . we next used _METHOD_ as a bait to screen pools of well plates for yellow bifc _METHOD_ . for this analysis we cotransfected protoplasts with mcherry rather than _METHOD_ to determine transfection efficiency . parallel experiments indicated that _METHOD_ competed with for interaction with prey proteins and was therefore unsuitable as a transfection efficiency control . mcherry localizes to both the _LOCATION_ and the cytoplasm . although some pools showed sporadic weak bifc _METHOD_ signals pool showed numerous signals . further analysis indicated that plates and contained cdna clones whose protein products strongly interacted with _METHOD_ . clone contains the _PROTEIN_ cdna clone used previously as a positive control for interactions . citation previously showed that _PROTEIN_ interacts with both and . this plate additionally contains an identical _PROTEIN_ cdna . plate also contains a cdna clone encoding the rna binding protein that weakly interacts with . plate contains two cdna clones whose encoded proteins interact with the clone identified as encodes a myst like histone acetyltransferase and encodes a putative _PROTEIN_ . bifc analysis of dna extracted from rows and columns of plate ultimately identified two cdna clones whose cdnas encode proteins that interact with . the first of these is cyclophilin _PROTEIN_ . using yeast two hybrid analyses citation and citation previously identified several arabidopsis cyclophilins including _PROTEIN_ as proteins that interact with . finally we identified the clone whose protein product strongly interacts with _METHOD_ . unexpectedly this cdna encodes s adenosyl l homocysteine hydrolase _PROTEIN_ the same protein that strongly interacted with . thus screening our cdna library with as a bait uncovered proteins _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ previously identified to interact with in yeast several novel proteins that interact with and a novel protein that interacts with both and . the results of sequential screening of the cdna library for clones encoding interacting proteins are shown in supplemental data set online . figure shows representative pictures of these protein interactions . plant proteins that interact with the transferred agrobacterium virulence effector proteins and may be important for plant genetic transformation . we therefore tested homozygous mutants of genes encoding four of the novel interacting proteins for transformation susceptibility . exon insertions into _GENE_ or _GENE_ _PROTEIN_ did not alter transformation susceptibility . however figure shows that two independent insertions into _GENE_ and an insertion into an exon _PROTEIN_ like protein resulted in reduced transformation susceptibility . mutation of _GENE_ either by a t dna exon insertion _PROTEIN_ or by a missense mutation _PROTEIN_ resulted in _PROTEIN_ stable agrobacterium mediated transformation susceptibility but no difference in transient transformation susceptibility . the differential effects of the these mutations on transient and stable transformation efficiencies suggest either that _PROTEIN_ is important for t dna integration or that it is important for _PROTEIN_ of integrated but not nonintegrated transgenes . we also tested arabidopsis mutants in genes encoding interacting proteins . two independent mutations in the utr or an early exon of _GENE_ encoding a myst like histone acetyltransferase resulted in transient but not stable transformation hypersusceptibility . we previously identified other histone acetyltransferases that are important for transformation . mutation of _GENE_ encoding a putative _PROTEIN_ and two independent alleles of _GENE_ encoding the rna binding protein reduced transformation susceptibility . thus the bifc screen of the arabidopsis cdna library identified a total of five novel proteins involved in agrobacterium mediated transformation . we used the c terminal extension domain of arabidopsis telomerase reverse transcriptase _PROTEIN_ tagged with _METHOD_ to screen the _METHOD_ tagged arabidopsis cdna library . screening was conducted at the department of biological sciences of purdue university with a separately arrayed library of > colonies . twenty _METHOD_ of bait and prey dnas from pools of plates along with a cdna clone encoding mcherry were used to transfect tobacco by protoplasts and the resulting _METHOD_ was imaged by _METHOD_ microscopy . using a purification scheme similar to that described above we ultimately identified interacting clones encoding two different proteins that were in frame with the n terminal _METHOD_ tag . the first cdna corresponding to _GENE_ is annotated as an catenin like repeat containing protein . interaction of this protein with the cte occurred predominantly in the cytoplasm of by cells . the second cdna encodes a rna recognition motif containing protein that interacts with the cte in _LOCATION_ . figure shows representative pictures of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ resulting from interaction of at _PROTEIN_ with these two proteins . the cte domain _PROTEIN_ contains regions important for intracellular trafficking of human _PROTEIN_ including a _LOCATION_ export signal and _PROTEIN_ binding sites . the protein encoded by _GENE_ is a member of a structurally related group of armadillo repeat proteins with diverse cellular roles . the predominantly cytoplasmic localization of the _GENE_ bifc signal suggests possible involvement in intracellular trafficking of telomerase and/or nontelomeric functions of _PROTEIN_ . the _LOCATION_ localization of a complex comprising cte and a rrm containing protein encoded by _GENE_ suggests a possible telomeric function for this protein . several previously characterized telomeric binding proteins from plants and other _METHOD_ contain a rrm . their specific binding to telomeric single stranded dna is mediated by a tandem pair of rrm located at the c terminus of the protein . the _GENE_ protein contains one rrm sequence and could function as a dimer as is usual for many telomere binding proteins . its predicted size corresponds to candidate telomeric single stranded dna binding proteins suggested to perform telomere end _PROTEIN_ functions instead of at . the physiological role of these arabidopsis cte binding proteins remains to be elucidated . our bifc based protein protein interaction screening system identified some previously known and interacting proteins _PROTEIN_ . however we did not identify some previously known interacting proteins . for example protein interacts with all tested arabidopsis importin _METHOD_ as well as with interacting _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . because we did not identify cdnas encoding these proteins in pool plate that we investigated in detail we were curious as to whether these cdnas existed in our bifc library and if so whether they would _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ tagged fusion proteins . we therefore conducted pcr analyses on dna from various pools and individual plates using primers individually directed against each of the nine importin genes _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . these analyses identified cdnas for impa and and _PROTEIN_ . we could not identify cdnas for impa and nor could we identify a cdna encoding _PROTEIN_ . we previously failed to identify cdnas for impa and impa from mrna extracted from arabidopsis plants . these two importin genes may therefore be pseudogenes or are _PROTEIN_ at extremely low levels or only in a few specialized cell types . proteins encoded by the _METHOD_ tagged impa and cdnas that we identified in our library interacted with _METHOD_ to form cytoplasmic aggregates that frequently were perinuclear . occasionally confocal microscopy revealed importin interaction in the _LOCATION_ . these interactions were similar to those reported previously . thus a more extensive interrogation of our library identified many proteins previously known to interact with . in addition to not appearing in the _METHOD_ cdna library there are at least four reasons why a cdna clone present in the library would not encode a fusion protein that interacts with a given _METHOD_ tagged bait protein to generate yellow _METHOD_ the _METHOD_ peptide may be out of frame with the open reading frame encoded by the cdna the _METHOD_ peptide may be in frame with the orf encoded by the cdna but an in frame stop codon in the utr of the cdna prevents fusion of the _METHOD_ tag with the orf the _METHOD_ peptide may be in frame with a partial orf such that the interaction domain of the orf is not present the _METHOD_ peptide may be in frame with the orf encoded by the cdna but interaction of the _METHOD_ tagged orf with the _METHOD_ tagged bait protein does not permit correct folding of the _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ peptides _METHOD_ . the first three of these construction artifacts also apply to commonly used yeast two hybrid _METHOD_ . the fourth possibility is unique to bifc _METHOD_ . analysis of the _METHOD_ tagged cdna library indicated that most identified importin clones contained a full length importin orf . however during cdna synthesis the utr for a given cdna may be of variable length . therefore _METHOD_ importin clones may encode _METHOD_ peptides either in frame or out of frame with the importin orf . similarly several importin clones encoded _METHOD_ peptides in frame with the importin orf but in frame stop codons in the utr precluded tagging the importin orf with _METHOD_ . however some importin orfs were preceded by a shortened utr lacking this stop codon resulting in a _METHOD_ tag affixed to the importin orf . thus although most queried cdnas exist in our arrayed library some may not encode proteins that can interact with a particular bait . we arrayed tagged cdna clones _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . because our primary tagged cdna library contains to members it is therefore likely that an in frame _METHOD_ tagged cdna exists for most _PROTEIN_ arabidopsis genes . we further sought to characterize the makeup of the cdna library . whole arabidopsis plantlets were initially used for library construction . dna sequence analysis of random clones revealed that could readily be assigned to known arabidopsis orfs . the great majority of the remaining clones correspond to other arabidopsis sequences . of these annotated cdnas we identified only once just a few of the remaining cdnas were identified more than twice . only seven of the identified cdnas encode photosynthetic proteins five of these encode two different _PROTEIN_ proteins . of the sequenced cdnas four encode different ribosomal proteins . the underrepresentation of cdnas encoding abundant proteins strongly suggests that the library has remained balanced throughout its development and amplification . we further analyzed the sequenced cdna clones to determine what percentage encodes arabidopsis orfs in frame with the n terminal _METHOD_ tag . thirty five percent of the identified protein coding sequences were in frame with the _METHOD_ tag very close to the expected . thus the construction of our cdna library is random with respect to reading frame and the library remains balanced with respect to the representation of cdna sequences . bifc analyses currently employ several _METHOD_ derivatives including enhanced _METHOD_ and the high _METHOD_ _METHOD_ protein venus . several of these are currently used in plants _METHOD_ . one of the limitations of bifc is the self assembly of complementary _METHOD_ protein fragments . interaction of n and c terminal protein fragments may occur when strong promoters are used to generate high concentrations of these fragments in the cell and/or when highly _METHOD_ _METHOD_ derivatives are used thus increasing _METHOD_ detection sensitivity . _METHOD_ may be visualized in the absence of bait and prey protein interaction . self assembly can thus confound interpretation of bifc data yielding false positive interactions . although our initial reconstruction experiments indicated that self assembly was not a major problem we wished to determine the extent of self assembly and if present mitigate it . we thus quantified _METHOD_ signals derived from interaction of affixed to different _METHOD_ derivatives as bait proteins with _METHOD_ tagged proteins or ev proteins as preys . we _PROTEIN_ the prey proteins from a strong camv double promoter to mimic the situation with tagged cdna prey clones . we then altered the promoter and the n terminal fragment of _METHOD_ affixed to the bait . preliminary studies investigated the mutant _METHOD_ derivative _METHOD_ . this derivative shows a high signal to noise ratio when used for bifc reactions in animal cells . however use of this mutant _METHOD_ form when affixed to _METHOD_ resulted in extremely weak _METHOD_ signals even when paired with the strongly interacting protein _METHOD_ . we thus discontinued using this _METHOD_ derivative for our further investigations . figure and table show the results of these investigations . the transformation frequency measured by the percentage of protoplasts displaying red _METHOD_ from cotransfected dna encoding _METHOD_ was similar in all experiments . using the camv double promoter to _PROTEIN_ the bait construct resulted in stronger bifc signals than when the nos promoter was used . tagging the bait protein with nvenus generated stronger bifc signals than when was tagged with _METHOD_ . however nvenus tagged also produced a yellow _METHOD_ signal when paired with an empty _METHOD_ bait vector . this signal disappeared when was tagged with _METHOD_ essentially eliminating false positive signals resulting from self assembly of the complementing _METHOD_ protein fragments . we thus recommend that to eliminate false positive background _METHOD_ signals _METHOD_ rather than nvenus be used as the bait tag . we obtained similar results _PROTEIN_ of whether _PROTEIN_ or the _PROTEIN_ like protein was used as prey protein . we repeated these experiments three times each time we examined at least four fields containing > red _METHOD_ protoplasts for each construction . an important feature of this cdna screening system is that it is independent of the plant species and cdna library used . we initially used protoplasts from either arabidopsis leaves or tobacco by cells for screening . to assess the utility of this system in other plant species we bombarded flower _PROTEIN_ of orchid with plasmids _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ nvenus and dna from the _METHOD_ tagged arabidopsis cdna library and examined the _PROTEIN_ for _METHOD_ the next day . as a proof of concept we used pooled cdna clones from pool plate column row c and the single clone _PROTEIN_ previously identified as interacting with in arabidopsis protoplasts . figure shows that a similar bifc cdna screening system works well in orchid flower _PROTEIN_ when dna was delivered by particle bombardment bifc _METHOD_ signals appeared with increasing frequency and strength as the interacting clone was enriched among the samples . thus this bifc cdna library screening system is applicable to plant species and _METHOD_ other than arabidopsis and tobacco protoplasts . we developed a system to screen for protein protein interactions using a cdna library and a bait protein directly in planta . the system uses bifc as a readout for protein protein interactions . this system has a number of advantages over traditional protocols in which interacting proteins are first identified using a yeast two hybrid system followed by confirmation of interaction in plants because screening is conducted directly in plant cells it eliminates the necessity of screening a cdna library against a bait protein first in yeast then recloning the cdna into a plant _PROTEIN_ vector for confirmation in plants . it is thus more rapid and efficient . protein protein interactions occur in their native plant cell environment and can thus be localized to specific subcellular domains or organelles . the screening system is easily _PROTEIN_ to use cdna libraries from any plant species for testing in that plant species . thus scientists can rapidly evaluate protein protein interactions in any plant cell type that is amenable to transformation . figure shows a flow chart of how we have used this system to identify cdnas encoding proteins that interact with specific bait proteins . once bait protein _PROTEIN_ plasmids have been constructed screening the cdna library to identify and confirm individual cdna clones takes to weeks . we deposited the gateway cdna bifc _PROTEIN_ vectors the various bait vectors and the mixed cdna library in the _PROTEIN_ stock center at the ohio state university . we expect that this system will facilitate experimentation to define the nature and site of protein protein interactions in plants and to develop protein protein interaction networks important for understanding gene function .
