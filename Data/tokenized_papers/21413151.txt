plant _LOCATION_ bear a variety of transporters belonging to multigene families that are affected by environmental and nutritional conditions . in addition they often display identity making difficult investigation by current strategies . in this study we set up a targeted proteomics approach aimed at identifying and quantifying within single experiments the five major proton pumps of the autoinhibited h _PROTEIN_ family the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ intrinsic proteins _PROTEIN_ water channels _PROTEIN_ and ten members of ammonium transporters and nitrate transporter _PROTEIN_ families . proteotypic peptides were selected and isotopically labeled heavy versions were used for technical optimization and for quantification of the corresponding light version in biological samples . this approach allowed to quantify simultaneously nine _PROTEIN_ in leaf _LOCATION_ and _PROTEIN_ together with three autoinhibited h _PROTEIN_ two ammonium transporters and two _PROTEIN_ in root _LOCATION_ . similarly it was used to investigate the effect of a salt stress on the _PROTEIN_ of these latter transporters in roots . these novel data were compared with published transcriptome information and revealed a close correlation between _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and transcripts levels . the obtained resource is reusable and can be expanded to other transporter families for profiling of _LOCATION_ transporters .
in plants the aha subfamily of _PROTEIN_ corresponds to primary transporters citation located at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ where they create a proton electrochemical gradient which is further dissipated by secondary active transporters citation . among the eleven _METHOD_ present in arabidopsis we selected the five _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ that include the major _METHOD_ and are all _PROTEIN_ both in root and in leaf citation . aquaporins constitute another _PROTEIN_ family of transporters of which the subfamily of _PROTEIN_ corresponds to the water channels located at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ citation . it includes members classified into two subgroups that are _PROTEIN_ as well in root as in leaf citation and the _METHOD_ were selected . nitrogen is a for plant that is accumulated either as nitrate or as ammonium by secondary active transporters . the two families of nitrate transporters _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ encompass and genes respectively in arabidopsis citation . two members of each family including those the best characterized to date were selected _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ together with _PROTEIN_ that constitutes a putative partner of _PROTEIN_ proteins in nitrate transport citation . the _PROTEIN_ family of amts contains five members in arabidopsis citation . these five genes that are _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in roots were selected . figure shows the work flow used for the simultaneous analysis of the targeted transporters . in the first step proteins of interest were submitted to in silico analysis in order to identify tryptic peptides unique in the whole arabidopsis genome . an average of ten unique peptides was identified per transporter . these peptides were then screened for their predicted potential response and chromatographic behavior . by setting a threshold of for the response predictor and fixing a retention time window compatible with a total duration of h per run peptides were predicted to display favorable properties . finally these peptides were checked for the occurrence of the previously described modification such as phosphorylation citation citation citation or methylation citation . for a large proportion of accessions this set of criteria resulted in a limited number of candidates whereas for some of them like most _PROTEIN_ a quite large number of convenient peptides were identified thus offering the additional possibility to target specific regions of the protein when desired . one proteotypic peptide fulfilling the criteria above could be chosen for every transporter excepted for _PROTEIN_ for which a nonoptimal peptide was selected because all unique peptides of which were predicted to display weak responses or known to be susceptible to phosphorylation . corresponding heavy _METHOD_ of the peptides were synthesized by labeling the amino acid thus producing a _METHOD_ increase of da for peptides and da for peptides . for each peptide the three more intense transitions were selected for the identification in the multiple reaction monitoring mode . in order to improve the sensitivity ionization and fragmentation parameters were optimized for all transitions using a stepwise procedure and _METHOD_ citation citation as described in section . for most peptides the dp displayed a broad optimum that was identical or very close for the different transitions of a given peptide . accordingly a same optimal dp value was used for all transitions of a peptide . by contrast for part of the peptides the impact of ce on the signal differed depending on the transition . thus ce was taken as a parameter and specific values were used for the transitions of a same peptide . however for the peptide selected for _PROTEIN_ it was not possible to optimize three transitions in a robust way . this peptide was removed from the analysis and not replaced by another one due to unfavorable features of other _PROTEIN_ peptides . overall these results are in fair agreement with conclusions raised for various other types of peptide sets of similar size as well from soluble proteins citation citation citation as from _LOCATION_ proteins citation . the peptides for which optimized conditions were available could be identified in a single run in the mrm mode when monitoring the associated transitions . as such this indicated that the combination of predictors used for peptide selection was efficient enough to allow qualitative global analysis of most of the selected set of transporter _METHOD_ . however in the quantification perspective another crucial feature is the _PROTEIN_ effect that affects the ionization yield of a given peptide in its environment when it is eluted from the lc into the _METHOD_ spectrometer . no clear consensus emerged to date concerning this point citation that is taken into account to various extents from the simple _PROTEIN_ of a known amount of heavy peptide into the sample citation citation to the production of dose response curves in the biological _PROTEIN_ of interest citation citation . in this study this latter option was selected and dilution curves were obtained for each transition in a digest of arabidopsis _LOCATION_ peptides . subsequently the linear regression curve having the highest slope was selected for the quantification of the corresponding peptide . to date immunodetection of _PROTEIN_ aquaporins is hampered by the high amino acid sequence identity and available antibodies usually do not allow to distinguish within the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ groups of _METHOD_ citation citation . in a first trial of proof of concept the above strategy was used to delineate the profile of _PROTEIN_ aquaporins in the leaves from plants . nine out the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ could be identified in the leaf _LOCATION_ as giving signal above the loq of the transition used for quantification . these included four and five respectively out the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ groups . the two _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ accounting each for of the total amount appeared to be the major _METHOD_ in the leaf whereas _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ contributed collectively to one quarter of the total the other detected _PROTEIN_ constituting only minor _METHOD_ . in _METHOD_ of protein amount major _PROTEIN_ were present in the pmol range per mg of microsomal _LOCATION_ . taking into account the molecular weight of _PROTEIN_ this indicated that _PROTEIN_ accounted for ca . of leaf _LOCATION_ proteins . these data provide the first quantitative information available at the protein and isoform levels . _PROTEIN_ the amount of _PROTEIN_ they are in agreement with the previous data measuring their relative abundance from densitometric analysis of stained _PROTEIN_ profiles and estimating that _PROTEIN_ might constitute as high as of purified _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ proteins in spinach leaf citation . concerning the _METHOD_ no comparable information is available at the protein level but previous transcriptome analysis suggested that all _PROTEIN_ genes were _PROTEIN_ in leaves citation . the origin of this discrepancy is unknown but could reveal some disconnection between the accumulation of undetected _METHOD_ and the corresponding transcripts . alternatively this could be linked to the difference in age of plants used in the two studies . however it can be noticed that seven out of the nine _METHOD_ reported here could also be identified by shotgun _METHOD_ analysis on similar samples . these latter included notably the six more abundant _METHOD_ according to mrm assays . thus collectively these results converge to indicate that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in young arabidopsis leaves . changes in the abiotic environment affect simultaneously the _PROTEIN_ of different families of transporters in plants . to assess the capacity of the strategy above to address this issue we selected a short salt stress to perform another methodological trial . short nacl treatment was previously shown to constitute a stress of _PROTEIN_ osmotic nature that affects as well the hydraulic conductivity of roots as the accumulation of _PROTEIN_ transcripts citation . under similar conditions both some aha and _PROTEIN_ are also affected at short term by a slightly weaker stress but were reported to be even more altered at longer term citation . therefore we imposed a stronger stress for a short period and compared the aha amt _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ profiles in roots . among the five aha _METHOD_ tested _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and aha were detected _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and only _PROTEIN_ appeared to constitute a major protein in the _LOCATION_ . for secondary active transporters among amts both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were identified but not _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . similarly for nitrate transporters only one transporter _PROTEIN_ and one transporter _PROTEIN_ were observed but not _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ nor the putative _PROTEIN_ regulator _PROTEIN_ . concerning the _PROTEIN_ all _METHOD_ could be detected in the root . three of them _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ dominated the profile and accounted for nearly the three quarters of the total amount whereas _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ showed intermediate abundance . at the same time for each family the _METHOD_ assumed to be the most _PROTEIN_ in root _LOCATION_ were actually found at high level citation citation . collectively present data suggest that the _PROTEIN_ aquaporins are by far the most abundant integral proteins in roots being accumulated at more than five times higher level than primary transporters whereas secondary active transporters constitute minor proteins . in addition they show that the present strategy has the capacity to characterize transporters differing by nearly three orders of magnitude in _METHOD_ of abundance . _PROTEIN_ not detected transporters at the exception of _PROTEIN_ for all others available annotation indicates that the genes were previously found _PROTEIN_ in roots . the origin of this discrepancy is not clear and could be associated as well to differences in culture conditions as to a poor connexion between transcript and protein accumulation for some _METHOD_ of proton pumps and ammonium or nitrate transporters . in addition it should be pointed out that crude _LOCATION_ fractions were used here and that some minor _METHOD_ might become detectable only when using highly purified _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ fractions . as shown in fig . a salt stress induced a significant _PROTEIN_ in the amount of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and several _PROTEIN_ notably the more abundant ones . this _PROTEIN_ ranged between and in an way . although none of these _METHOD_ is involved in sodium or chloride transport this situation is not unexpected . actually global comparative transcriptome analysis using microarrays citation previously indicated that the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ transcripts were downaccumulated in roots after a weaker but slightly longer stress compared with that imposed in the present study . although only the amount of the _PROTEIN_ isoform is observed here to _PROTEIN_ significantly in response to salt stress it can be noticed that a similar but not significant tendency was also observed for the _PROTEIN_ isoform . in addition nearly all _PROTEIN_ transcripts were reported to be downaccumulated by short salt stress citation citation in close agreement with our results and western blot data using antibodies also indicated a _PROTEIN_ in the protein amount citation . thus as no information is available _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ transcript citation the changes measured here at the protein level appear to be globally in qualitative accordance with those reported for transcripts excepted possibly for nitrate transporters . however in this technological study focus was given to the simultaneous analysis of several transporters but with limited effort on biological conditions and replicates . thus present data must be taken primarily as illustrating the capacity of the approach and remain to be corroborated by thorough time course analysis prior to derive working hypothesis . it was shown for long time that a more or less pronounced disconnection may exist between protein and transcript accumulation levels although rarely assessed in plants citation . as quantitative protein information could be raised here for all the members of the _PROTEIN_ subfamily in root a comparison was tempted with data published at the transcript level for plants cultivated under similar conditions citation . figure shows that an overall high correlation did exist between the abundance of _METHOD_ as measured by targeted proteomics and published _PROTEIN_ transcript levels in root . the _PROTEIN_ exception concerned the _PROTEIN_ isoform that was roughly ten times more abundant than other _PROTEIN_ showing similar transcript accumulation . as _PROTEIN_ transcripts were also shown to be minor _PROTEIN_ transcripts in other studies using plants of different ages citation citation the origin of this discrepancy is unclear but likely not related to the plant developmental status . in addition when excluding _PROTEIN_ from the comparison the correlation coefficient was calculated as . thus overall and at the possible exception of _PROTEIN_ this comparison suggested for all other _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ a very good correlation between gene _PROTEIN_ and protein accumulation in root that remains however to be confirmed by simultaneous transcriptome and proteome analysis on the same samples .
