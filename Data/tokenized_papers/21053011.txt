arabidopsis thaliana belongs to those plants that do not naturally accumulate glycine betaine although its genome contains two genes _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ that code for betaine aldehyde dehydrogenases . badhs were initially known to catalyze the last step of the biosynthesis of gb in plants . but they can also oxidize metabolism derived aminoaldehydes to their corresponding amino acids in some cases . this study was carried out to investigate the functional properties of arabidopsis badh genes . here we have shown that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ proteins are targeted to leucoplasts and _LOCATION_ respectively . the _PROTEIN_ patterns of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ genes have been analysed under abiotic stress conditions . both genes are _PROTEIN_ in the plant and weakly induced by aba salt _PROTEIN_ methyl viologen and dehydration . the role of the _PROTEIN_ gene was analysed using t dna insertion mutants . there was no phenotypic difference between wild type and mutant plants in the absence of stress . but _PROTEIN_ seedlings and week old plants were more sensitive to dehydration and salt stress than wild type plants . the recombinant _PROTEIN_ enzyme was shown to oxidize betaine aldehyde aminobutyraldehyde and aminopropionaldehyde to their corresponding _PROTEIN_ acids . we hypothesize that _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ may serve as detoxification enzymes controlling the level of aminoaldehydes which are produced in cellular metabolism under stress conditions .
_PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ transcript accumulation was analysed in a. thaliana wild type plants . four week old plants were removed from the soil and incubated in water supplemented with aba mm nacl or methyl viologen for h. alternatively they were kept in water at for the _PROTEIN_ stress . rna blot analyses indicated that both the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ transcripts did increase upon these treatments . based on the _PROTEIN_ pattern of the cold and dehydration responsive gene _PROTEIN_ it appeared that highest _PROTEIN_ levels were obtained after h of the treatments . with _PROTEIN_ to this the semi quantitative analysis of the rna blot signals revealed that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are inducible by aba and to a lesser extent by nacl _PROTEIN_ and methyl viologen . as for the dehydration treatment both genes showed increasing _PROTEIN_ for h with _PROTEIN_ having the higher level always . these results indicate that the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ genes are stress responsive . the protein sequence for _PROTEIN_ does not contain an obvious sub cellular localization signal . _METHOD_ fusion constructs were generated to study the cellular localization of the protein . transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ construct show green fluorescing organelles which appear often pairwise and possess cytoplasmic strands . similar observations were made for arabidopsis leaves transiently transformed by particle bombardment with the same construct . these organelles are smaller than the surrounding chloroplasts suggesting a localization in leucoplasts . to ascertain this finding arabidopsis rosette leaves of wild type plants were incubated with lugol reagent for min at . microscopic observations of epidermis cells from lugol treated leaves under bright field showed starch containing leucoplasts with an intense brown colour coinciding with the _METHOD_ signal surrounding the _LOCATION_ . complementary experiments were carried out with two additional constructs _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . when the first n terminal amino acids are deleted from _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ the green _METHOD_ was not observed anymore in the leucoplasts but in the cytoplasm . likewise the _METHOD_ signal appeared in the cytoplasm for the _PROTEIN_ construct where the original n terminal part of the gene was placed in the middle of the construct by engineering the _METHOD_ protein in front of the _PROTEIN_ coding sequence . these observations confirm the presence of a leucoplast targeting signal within the first n terminal amino acids of the _PROTEIN_ protein . the _PROTEIN_ protein is predicted to be localized to _LOCATION_ as it has the _LOCATION_ targeting signal skl . to verify the prediction transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ the c terminal of the _PROTEIN_ protein fused to the _METHOD_ protein _PROTEIN_ were generated and analysed . green _METHOD_ was detected only in vesicle structures of a size less than . this observation indicates that _PROTEIN_ with its c terminal _PROTEIN_ signal skl is effectively targeted to _LOCATION_ . plant _LOCATION_ move along the actin filaments and cytoplasmic streaming and budding of _LOCATION_ depend on the integrity of the _LOCATION_ . therefore the peroxisomal localization of the _PROTEIN_ protein was further confirmed by incubating leaves of transgenic plants with cytochalasin b that reversibly binds to actin and prevents the formation of actin monomers breaking up the _LOCATION_ . most of the green fluorescing cell organelles became static h after cytochalasin b application . when the treated leaves were washed with water to release cytochalasin b movement of the green fluorescing organelles along the actin filaments recovered gradually and h after the release of cytochalasin b they moved as they were before the treatment . this suggests that the fluorescing organelles are _LOCATION_ and that _PROTEIN_ proteins have a peroxisomal location as previously indicated by _LOCATION_ proteome analyses . to investigate the possible function of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ genes t dna insertion mutants and were obtained for the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ genes . the line contains a t dna insertion within the intron of _PROTEIN_ . the gene is still _PROTEIN_ in isolated homozygous plants of this line . the line was therefore not analysed further . sequence analysis revealed that the mutant harbours a t dna insertion in the whereas the mutants contained a t dna insertion nucleotides upstream of the _PROTEIN_ translation start codon . homozygous mutant plants were isolated and analysed for the _PROTEIN_ of both aldh genes by rt pcr . the _PROTEIN_ transcript is absent in plants as compared to the wild type . but we found that the t dna insertion in that line also disrupted the _PROTEIN_ of the adjacent gene _PROTEIN_ . therefore the line an allelic t dna insertion mutant of was obtained from the saskatoon arabidopsis t dna collection and investigated . this mutant represents a single knockout of the _PROTEIN_ gene . the analysis of the segregation ratio of the herbicide glufosinate ammonium resistance in seedlings was performed as described by robinson et al . . it revealed that the line contains a single t dna insertion . as for the line the _PROTEIN_ transcripts are still present in the plants indicating that the _PROTEIN_ is not affected by the t dna insertion . another t dna insertion line with the t dna fragment inserted in the intron of _PROTEIN_ was also screened but again the gene was still _PROTEIN_ . no other knockout line was available for _PROTEIN_ . therefore subsequent experiments were only performed with plants . the susceptibility of _PROTEIN_ knockout plants to abiotic stress was investigated in seedlings and adult plants . seeds were first germinated and grown in vitro on _METHOD_ medium supplemented with mm nacl or mm mannitol . as shown in fig . seedlings showed more chlorosis together with high accumulation of anthocyanins on salt or mannitol containing medium . under stress conditions plant _LOCATION_ lipids are oxidized which often leads to the accumulation of the toxic compound malondialdehyde . consistent with the visual observations there was no difference in mda contents of wt and seedlings under control conditions . however plants accumulated more mda than wt when grown on _METHOD_ medium supplemented with mm nacl . likewise the mda content was higher in mutants than in wild type when seedlings were grown on _METHOD_ agar supplemented with mm mannitol . to analyse the salt and drought response in adult plants seedlings were transferred to soil and allowed to grow in pots for weeks . the pots were watered every days with water or with water containing mm nacl for days . alternatively drought stress was imposed by withdrawing water for days . as shown in fig . and b adult plants accumulated higher mda levels than wt upon salt and drought stress . the mda contents were similar in regularly watered wt and mutants . like glycine betaine proline is a compatible solute that accumulates in plants under stress conditions . free proline content was quantified from the mutants and the wt under control and stress conditions . no significant difference was observed in the free proline contents of the wt and plants . altogether the results show that the disruption of the _PROTEIN_ gene _PROTEIN_ has negatively affected the sensitivity of plants to salt and dehydration stress . to examine the function of the arabidopsis badh coding genes the cdna fragments of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were cloned in the pet _PROTEIN_ vector . the recombinant badh proteins were over _PROTEIN_ in e. coli cells and purified from the soluble protein fraction by his tag affinity chromatography . as shown in the supplementary fig . only small amounts of the recombinant _PROTEIN_ were purified under native conditions but sufficient amounts of purified _PROTEIN_ protein were obtained and used for enzymatic activity assays . the _PROTEIN_ recombinant protein converted betaine aldehyde aminobutyraldehyde and aminopropylaldehyde to glycine betaine gaba and aminopropanoic acid respectively . with nad as cofactor the enzyme displayed a km of mm for betaine aldehyde mm for abal and mm for apal . like previously identified badhs the _PROTEIN_ exhibited both betaine aldehyde and aminoaldehyde dehydrogenase activities and could be actively _PROTEIN_ in e. coli . over _PROTEIN_ of either _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ in e. coli did not render the bacteria more tolerant to sodium chloride or than cells transformed with the vector only .
