myosin motor proteins are thought to carry out important functions in the establishment and _PROTEIN_ of cell _PROTEIN_ by moving cellular components such as organelles vesicles or protein complexes along the actin _LOCATION_ . in arabidopsis thaliana disruption of the myosin _PROTEIN_ gene leads to reduced elongation of the highly _PROTEIN_ root hairs suggesting that the encoded motor protein is involved in this cell growth . detailed live cell observations in this study revealed that xik root hairs elongated more slowly and stopped growth sooner than those in wild type . overall cellular organization including the actin _LOCATION_ appeared normal but actin filament dynamics were reduced in the mutant . accumulation of _PROTEIN_ containing vesicles on the other hand was not significantly different from wild type . a functional _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion protein that could complement the mutant phenotype accumulated at the tip of growing root hairs in an actin dependent manner . the distribution of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ at the tip however did not match that of the _LOCATION_ or several tip enriched markers including _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . we conclude that the myosin _PROTEIN_ is required for normal actin dynamics and plays a role in the subapical region of growing root hairs to facilitate optimal growth .
four t dna insertion mutants of _PROTEIN_ from the salk collection were isolated and their t dna insertion site confirmed by genomic pcr . among them xik and xik were identified as knockout mutants by rt pcr in agreement with reports by other groups _PROTEIN_ while two new insertion alleles in the promoter region still _PROTEIN_ the transcript . the presence of a strong root hair phenotype in xik suggests potential differences in _PROTEIN_ levels that should be investigated in the future . a full length cdna was assembled from two independent est clones . its sequence corresponded to the major transcript identified by deep sequencing and included a different end from the previous annotations . in particular the transcriptional start site was approximately bp further upstream and a different splice acceptor site was utilized for the first intron when compared to . as a result the encoded protein had a different n terminus that included only a short extension upstream of a like domain . thus the gene structure of _PROTEIN_ appears to be similar to other plant myosin xi genes with a long first intron that follows immediately after the start codon . under our conditions root hairs of xik usually grew to about of root hair length in wild type consistent with previous reports _PROTEIN_ . this phenotype could have resulted from two different _METHOD_ mutant root hairs might have grown normally but stopped growing earlier than wild type or they might have grown more slowly than wild type for the same duration . to distinguish between these possibilities root hair growth rates were measured over time at high resolution on the microscope stage . this experiment was repeated four times per genotype and one representative result is shown in . under these conditions xik mutants grew for hours while wild type grew for up to about hours . both wild type and mutants showed growth rate oscillations as reported previously . as root hairs got older their growth rate declined and eventually reached zero . however comparison of growth rates of root hairs of similar age revealed that growth rates of xik were much lower than those of wild type . maximum root hair growth rate in xik under these conditions was while wild type reached a maximum growth rate of suggesting that root hairs in xik grew more slowly from the beginning . overall average growth rates were and _PROTEIN_ in wild type and xik respectively _PROTEIN_ . in addition xik stopped growing more than one hour earlier than wild type . thus xik mutants produced shorter root hairs than wild type because of a reduced growth rate as well as premature cessation of growth . time series of dic images of col and xik . delay between images min . size bar indicates . young col root hairs grew faster than those

line indicates an individual root hair from a xik seedling . total root hair length over time for a xik root hair and a wild type root hair . arrows indicate approximate time point of cessation of growth . _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ associates with secretory vesicles that accumulate in the tip of growing root hairs and thus can be used as a marker for growth . since root hairs in xik mutants were growing more slowly and stopped growing earlier than in wild type the effect of the xik mutation on _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ accumulation was observed . root hairs from both wild type and xik mutants clearly displayed accumulation of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ at the tip of growing root hairs . a direct comparison of the level of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ accumulation was not possible since high variation in _PROTEIN_ levels even among root hairs of the same root prevented quantitative comparisons of wild type and mutant . to investigate the effect of the xik mutation on the accumulation of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in greater detail _METHOD_ _METHOD_ at the tip of root hairs was monitored over time using an automated algorithm that tracked the root hair tip during growth . interestingly tip accumulation of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in both wild type and xik frequently displayed a stochastic loss and recovery at the tip of root hairs . coefficients of variation at the tip of xik root hairs were slightly higher but not significantly different from those of wild type . time series of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ images of col and xik . accumulation of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ at the tip of growing root hairs fluctuated similarly in both col and in xik . delay between images min also see movie . size bar indicates . fluctuation of normalized _METHOD_ intensity of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ during min . green line indicates data from col while magenta line indicates xik . intensity fluctuations in xik were similar to those in col . coefficients of variation of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ accumulation in the tip . every dot represents data from one root hair . means of coefficients of variation were not significantly different in the two genotypes . in addition several other markers for _LOCATION_ and the _LOCATION_ were observed in xik mutants . in general we did not observe clear differences in marker distribution between wt and xik root hairs . for example the _LOCATION_ marker _LOCATION_ cb showed the same distribution in wt and mutant root hairs . similarly _METHOD_ which binds to phosphatidylinositol phosphate _PROTEIN_ at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ as well as to some intracellular vesicles showed indistinguishable localization in the two genotypes . recent reports demonstrate that motor proteins can affect organization of the actin _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . to examine possible effects of xik in root hairs actin organization in growing root hairs was visualized by decoration with _METHOD_ . this marker labels the long filaments and cables along the shank of a root hair but does not label the fine actin filaments behind the growing tip . overall organization of the actin filaments was similar in xik and in wild type as has previously been reported for leaf petiole epidermal cells _PROTEIN_ . this arrangement of actin filaments however was not static . time lapse analysis revealed dramatic _PROTEIN_ displacements of actin cables that often appeared to travel like waves through the cell . interestingly these dynamic rearrangements of actin filaments appeared to be reduced in xik root hairs . quantitative analysis of these dynamics by measuring the decay of image cross correlation over time revealed that actin movements were significantly reduced in the mutant . thus myosin _PROTEIN_ is required for normal dynamic behavior of actin filaments but is not necessary for normal organization of actin filaments in the root hair shank . actin filament organization as labeled with _METHOD_ is similar in xik and col . images are single frames from time lapse observations in cells col and xik in panel b respectively . actin filament activity in wild type and mutant root hair cells as determined by the decay of image cross correlation with increasing time intervals . box and whiskers plot indicate median and percentile as well as minimal and maximal decay constants for the ten most active regions in a given cell . mean activity levels in col are significantly higher than in xik . to gain a better understanding of the involvement of _PROTEIN_ driven movements in root hair tip growth it is necessary to identify the cargo of _PROTEIN_ . as a first step towards this goal we wanted to determine the intracellular localization of _PROTEIN_ . thus a wild type _PROTEIN_ cdna was cloned behind the coding region of _METHOD_ and transformed into xik mutants under the control of its native promoter _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . three individual transgenic lines were identified and their root hair length was measured . in all cases _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ could complement xik root hair growth . the average length of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ xik root hairs was mm _PROTEIN_ which is slightly longer than that of wild type while xik produced significantly shorter root hairs . in addition root hair growth rates were increased back to those of wild type . while the average growth rate of growing root hairs in xik was _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ xik showed an average growth rate of _PROTEIN_ which is slightly higher than in wild type _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . these results confirmed that the slower growth of root hairs in xik mutants resulted from the lack of _PROTEIN_ motor proteins . in addition this also established that the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion protein could function normally in plants which implies that these transgenic plants could be used to observe normal _PROTEIN_ localization in cells . root hairs of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ xik seedlings displayed long root hairs similar to those of col . pictures were taken with five day old seedlings grown on vertical growth media solidified with phytagel . lengths of mature root hairs . root hairs of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ xik showed similar length as those of wild type _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . _LOCATION_ bars represent standard _LOCATION_ of the mean . average growth rate of root hairs in _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ xik was similar to those of col . growth rates were measured in second intervals _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . _LOCATION_ bars represent standard _LOCATION_ of the mean . _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ signal was low in all tissues examined suggesting that _PROTEIN_ myosin protein levels are generally low in plant cells . interestingly relatively high accumulation of _METHOD_ was observed at the tip of growing root hairs . this accumulation of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was stable while root hairs were growing but disappeared when root hairs were fully grown . occasionally distinct small spots appeared in the shank of root hairs that moved both towards and away from the tip . stable transgenic plants of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in xik background showed maximal accumulation of _METHOD_ signal in the subapex of growing root hairs . weaker accumulation occurred in the extreme tip . _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ labeled vesicles are difficult to distinguish at the tip while they are easier to detect in the shank of root hairs . images are representative frames from a minute time lapse observation . size bar indicates . to test whether the tip accumulation of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ resulted from functional _PROTEIN_ movement along actin filaments to deliver its cargo to the tip of a growing root hair the actin polymerization inhibitor latrunculin b was used to observe the effect of actin filament disruption on the localization of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . we employed a relatively low concentration of latb that was sufficient to stop root hair growth within to minutes . consistent with previous reports actin organization in the tip region of growing root hairs was rapidly altered in all cells we observed . interestingly short actin filaments appeared in the apical region that normally excluded this marker similar to what has been described for pollen tubes . these clearly detectable filaments were accompanied by a general increase in _METHOD_ signal intensity in this area suggesting that additional filaments were formed that were accessible to the _METHOD_ marker but that could not be resolved by _METHOD_ . the presence of _METHOD_ signal in this area of the root hair indicates that the typical fine actin mesh that normally occupies the subapical region was disrupted by the latb treatment . long actin filaments in the shank were replaced with shorter filaments only after longer treatment times typically after growth had already stopped suggesting that these filaments were relatively stable and turned over only slowly . root hairs _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ or _METHOD_ were treated with nm latrunculin b during observation on the microscope _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . dic and _METHOD_ images were captured in s intervals . _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ images were captured near the center of the root hair whereas _METHOD_ images show the cortical actin filaments . representative images from movies and at the indicated times are shown . size bar for a c . prior to treatment _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ accumulated near the tip and actin filaments formed many primarily longitudinal bundles in the shank . computational detection of actin filaments is shown below the _METHOD_ image . note that this actin marker does not label the fine actin mesh in the apical region of the root hair . within min of latb treatment _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ intensity in the tip _PROTEIN_ while actin cables showed first signs of disorganization with the appearance of short filaments in the apical region . at this time large _LOCATION_ were seen to approach the tip . after min of latb treatment _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was largely absent from the tip and formed larger clusters in the subapical and shank regions . _METHOD_ cables were still present in the shank and also were present in the tip region of the root hair . these areas were separated by a region with no or few actin filaments and low _METHOD_ intensity . kymograph of dic images

application . kymograph of _METHOD_ images . _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was strongest near the tip before latb application but then dropped quickly in the tip region . by contrast _METHOD_ signal in the tip was low prior to treatment but increased in the presence of latb . curved white lines indicate position of the root hair tip . quantitative analysis of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ accumulation in the tip . solid lines indicate _METHOD_ intensities of the two markers within the first of the root hair over time . dashed line in right graph indicates the distance of the front most actin filament from the tip . vertical dotted line indicates start of latb treatment during which root hair shifted and focus had to be reestablished . in parallel to the accumulation of actin in the tip region we observed a loss of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ signal in the same area . this loss of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ accumulation was accompanied by the appearance of _LOCATION_ in the apical area indicating a dramatic reorganization of the tip cytoplasm . during latb treatment _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ began to appear in several larger aggregates dispersed throughout the root hair . these aggregates did not represent accumulations of _LOCATION_ since they did not coincide with the soluble mcherry marker . taken together our data indicate that growing root hairs respond rapidly to moderate concentrations of latb by reorganizing their actin _LOCATION_ near the tip which is accompanied by a rapid loss of myosin _PROTEIN_ near the tip . the accumulation of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in the root hair tip could result from one of several _METHOD_ among them the association with _PROTEIN_ vesicles that accumulate in the apical area . in addition the rho/rac like small g protein _PROTEIN_ has been recognized as an essential regulator of tip growth that accumulates both at the apical _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and on vesicles near the apex . similarly _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ has been shown to accumulate at the tip of growing root hairs and _PROTEIN_ mutants showed stochastic _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fluctuations . alternatively the tip region is known to be rich in _LOCATION_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ accumulation might simply reflect free diffusion into the accessible space in the tip . thus to gain additional insight into the mechanism of _PROTEIN_ accumulation at the tip and its likely cargo we compared the distribution of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ with several markers in root hairs of double transgenic plants . interestingly accumulation of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ overlapped partially within the apical dome but the peak of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ accumulation occurred closer to the apex than that of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . quantitative analysis of signal distribution over time revealed a stable accumulation of the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ maximum approximately ahead of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ maximum . in addition tip accumulation of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fluctuated independently suggesting that the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ labeled vesicles at the root hair apex were not associated with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was partially colocalized near the apex where _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ accumulated however _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ signal was weaker in the apical dome of the root hair tip while _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was highly accumulated in that area . this was confirmed by a quantitative analysis of the position of maximal signal intensity in several root hair cells . a similar distribution in the cytoplasm was observed for mcherry _PROTEIN_ except that this marker was also present at the apical _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . thus _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ accumulation peaks closer to the apex than _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ containing vesicles . finally we established that _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ is not simply freely diffusing in the tip region by comparing it to a soluble _LOCATION_ marker mcherry and observing that their distributions in the tip did not match . specifically we found that _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ accumulation peaked approximately ahead of the mcherry marker . first row of each panel shows _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ localization in the root hairs while the second row presents other markers in the same root hairs . merged images are shown in the third row . to compare localizations pixel intensity along the root hair center of each merged image was visualized in the fourth row . signal intensities along the first near the tip are shown to emphasize the distribution of the two proteins near the tip of root hairs . scale bar indicates . partial colocalization of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . although _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ localized at the tip of root hairs _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ proteins accumulated closer to the apex while _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ signal was maximal in the subapex of the root hairs . also compare movie . partial colocalization of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ labeled vesicles accumulated further away from the root hair tip than _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ which resulted in partial overlap with the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ signal . mcherry _PROTEIN_ localization in _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . localization of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was clearly distinguishable from both inactive mcherry _PROTEIN_ in the _LOCATION_ and active mcherry _PROTEIN_ at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . distribution of _LOCATION_ mcherry was different from _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ localization at the root hair tip suggesting that accumulation of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ at the tip did not reflect free diffusion . distance of maximal signal intensity from the tip in actively growing root hairs . values represent mean sd and are given in . the maxima are statistically different from each other except for the different _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ data and the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and mcherry comparison . rop _PROTEIN_ are crucial regulators of tip growth that coordinate calcium and ros signaling . they are recruited to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ in the tip of root hairs and pollen tubes although the inactive form of rop proteins accumulates in the _LOCATION_ . this general distribution was found in both wild type and xik root hairs _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ or mcherry _PROTEIN_ even though the signal at the pm of the mutant seemed slightly reduced . to quantify the recruitment of _PROTEIN_ to the pm we developed an automated algorithm that determined the _METHOD_ signal at the tip relative to a segment of the _LOCATION_ immediately behind the apex . the relative pm accumulation of _PROTEIN_ fluctuated slightly over time but the amplitude of these fluctuations was smaller than seen for _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and also did not show any periodicity as is typical for calcium concentrations . importantly the pm recruitment was reduced in the xik mutant compared to wild type suggesting that _PROTEIN_ might be involved in rop _PROTEIN_ signaling required for tip growth but not for cell _PROTEIN_ . _METHOD_ images of mcherry _PROTEIN_ distribution in col and xik root hairs . size bar represents . quantification of _PROTEIN_ recruitment to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ in growing root

also tested whether _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ restored normal targeting of mcherry _PROTEIN_ to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . interestingly the pm/cs ratio of mcherry _PROTEIN_ did not change in the complemented mutants _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ suggesting that the reduced relative abundance of the g protein at the pm of mutant root hairs is not responsible for their slower growth . this conclusion is also supported by a lack of correlation between growth rates and pm/cs values for individual root hairs .
mutant alleles were isolated from the salk collection and col was used as wild type . xik and xik have been described previously _PROTEIN_ . new insertional xik alleles identified in this study were and . additional alleles were described elsewhere xik was isolated by xik was identified by _PROTEIN_ while another allele was described in _PROTEIN_ . positions of all insertions are marked in . plants were grown in a growth chamber at in h light and at in h dark with about humidity . for root hair length measurements seeds were germinated on square plates of strength _METHOD_ with sucrose ph adjusted to and solidified with phytagel . plates were incubated at off vertical in a growth chamber with continuous light . day old seedlings were used for the measurements . the construct for the complementation test was driven by the _PROTEIN_ native promoter which extended bp upstream of the _PROTEIN_ start codon and included the first exon and intron of _PROTEIN_ . the promoter was followed by _METHOD_ _METHOD_ a short linker dna encoding elyggpggsgsa and the full length _PROTEIN_ coding region . this construct was introduced to the binary plasmid and transformed into xik mutants using the floral dip method . a full length _PROTEIN_ cdna was assembled by combining two est clones and which cover the entire length of the gene including utr and utr . root hair lengths were measured in images of day old seedlings that were captured under a stereomicroscope _METHOD_ equipped with digital camera _PROTEIN_ under magnification or magnification . images were acquired with leica software . more than root hair lengths from or more plants in each genotype were measured with imagej and statistically analyzed in prism . to measure root hair growth rate special devices as described in were used with a modification to _PROTEIN_ plants healthy during observation . briefly day old vertically grown seedlings were moved to a cover glass bottom culture dish and covered with ml of media containing strength _METHOD_ salt sucrose and type vii agarose at ph . culture dish chambers were sealed and placed in the growth chamber for up to one day . the culture dish chambers were tilted off vertical so that roots would grow along the cover glass . dic images of root hairs were taken with an orca _LOCATION_ camera in sec . intervals for min . or hour under a objective with binning turned off to maximize spatial resolution . time lapse capture was repeated times to observe the entire growth of a root hair from shortly after bulging to fully grown . length of root hairs was measured with the measurement plug in in openlab . data were analyzed and graphed with prism . constructs and their transgenic plants are listed in online . briefly _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was generated from amplified cdna sequences based on the published sequence information . _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was constructed from amplified cdna sequences with published primer information . constructs were transformed into wild type and xik mutants by agrobacterium mediated transformation . stable transgenic plants were screened with appropriate antibiotics or herbicides and observed under a _METHOD_ microscope . for _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ the dna fragment containing the _PROTEIN_ promoter was obtained by pcr from genomic dna with _PROTEIN_ f _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ r . the pcr product was cloned in pgem teasy vector and sequenced then moved to a binary vector with xbai and ecori restriction . unless noted otherwise all microscopic observations were carried out with a plan apo oil immersion objective on an axiovert microscope with filter sets for _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and mcherry observation . for most observations seedlings were mounted in a cover slip bottom culture dish under a thin phytagel blanket containing standard growth medium . images were captured at regular intervals with a digital ccd camera _LOCATION_ controlled by openlab software . for quantitative image analysis a dark background image was captured under identical exposure settings and subtracted from all _METHOD_ images to remove camera noise . spro _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in pcambia kindly provided by e. nielsen was transformed independently into col and xik homozygous seeds were grown for four days on vertical plates as described above before imaging . time lapse sequences of _METHOD_ and dic were separated and analyzed with a custom macro in imagej . to measure coefficients of variation of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ at the root hair tip _METHOD_ intensities were measured in the apical dome . raw intensity values were bleach corrected by normalizing to a predicted first order exponential decay whose parameters were obtained by linear regression of log transformed data . to capture the variability of the _METHOD_ intensity the coefficient of variation was calculated by dividing the standard deviation by the mean intensity . statistical analyses and graphing of results were performed with prism . an actin marker _METHOD_ was transformed into both wild type and xik mutant and stable transgenic plants were screened for reliable _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . time lapse images of growing root hairs were taken in s intervals for min . with microscope settings as described above . images were exported to and analyzed in imagej . actin dynamics were quantified by determining the decay of image cross correlation over time _PROTEIN_ with the following modifications . since decay constants depend strongly on the size of the selection and the region of the cell analyzed we separated the time lapse sequence into x squares and performed the calculations on each of them . two series of squares were created with displacement to avoid possible _METHOD_ with inadequate selection of squares . for each square cross correlation was calculated for increasing intervals between all possible image frame pairs with a custom macro in imagej . a single phase exponential decay was fitted to the data in prism according to . where is the calculated cross correlation for interval length p is the calculated plateau of the curve and k is the decay constant . it is usually not possible to reliably fit a decay curve for all squares in a time lapse sequence mostly due to weak _METHOD_ signals . to avoid these problematic areas we selected the squares with the largest span for further analysis since these corresponded to the regions of the cell where the strongest actin signal was obtained . the decay constants k from these squares were plotted and their average was used to perform a mann whitney test between wt and xik cells . actin filaments were identified by filtering smoothed _METHOD_ images with a four fold linear kernel which effectively identifies linear features analogously to multidirectional non maximum suppression . the resulting image was binarized with the isodata threshold and the remaining lines were reduced down to single pixels with the skeletonize command of imagej . the resulting line segments were filtered for a minimum length of with the analyze particles command and measured for length and position in the cell . image stacks were processed with a custom macro in imagej . stable transgenic lines of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ were isolated in both wild type and xik background . individual root hairs were imaged every s for min . images were exported to imagej and analyzed by a custom macro that tracked the tip during growth and identified the position of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ in the central half of the root hair . _METHOD_ intensity of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ as well as of the _LOCATION_ behind the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ was measured and exported to excel for quantitative analysis . statistical tests were performed in prism . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ xik plants were observed for their _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in root hairs . microscope settings were identical to the analysis of _PROTEIN_ accumulation except that longer exposure times were used . sequential images were obtained under with binning for min with s intervals . for drug treatment day old seedlings grown as described above were transferred to the observation chambers . inhibitors were diluted in liquid media and applied underneath the solid media blanket covering the root of a seedling in the observation chambers _METHOD_ . images were taken for min in sec intervals and processed as described above . for colocalization tests _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mcherry _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mcherry were transformed into homozygous _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ xik plants . seedlings were screened on media with double selection and moved to a vertical plate without selection for additional growth for a day to allow normal growth of root hairs . once seedlings started producing normally shaped root hairs they were moved to an observation chamber and sequential dual color images were acquired for one to minutes in to s intervals . distribution of signal intensities along the root hair were determined with a custom macro in imagej by calculating the average signal intensity per row of pixels at different distances from the root hair tip . maximal signals were normalized to for each frame of the time lapse sequence and normalized signal intensities were averaged over all time points . at least seven cells were analyzed in this way and the position of the maximal signals averaged for each of the markers .
