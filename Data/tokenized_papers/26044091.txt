_PROTEIN_ of the arabidopsis halleri hyperaccumulation gene _PROTEIN_ in a. thaliana reveals functional differentiation among the three copies and non _PROTEIN_ localization of the protein in root pericycle cells .
based on sequence similarity it was postulated that if functional differences exist among the three copies they are most likely determined by the promoters . to individually examine the function of each gene copy homozygous transgenic lines were generated of the _PROTEIN_ loss of function a. thaliana mutant _PROTEIN_ the same cdna under the control of each of the three promoters . owing to technical constraints relatively short versions of the and promoters _PROTEIN_ were cloned previously for a promoter gus reporter study . here longer dna fragments of and upstream of the _PROTEIN_ start codon were cloned for and respectively based on available a. halleri bac sequences in the _PROTEIN_ locus . for the promoter the fragment described in et al . was used . because no antibody raised against the _PROTEIN_ protein is available an _METHOD_ fusion was cloned in order to localize the _PROTEIN_ protein in planta . in the described growth conditions on standard soil the _PROTEIN_ mutant developed its typical phenotype _METHOD_ were very small which led to a bushy aspect with chlorotic leaves and inflorescences presented no pollen and sterile flowers in contrast to the wild type as previously described . _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ under the control of any of the three promoters fully complemented the mutant restoring a wild type like phenotype the plants developed normally and were able to flower and set seeds without additional zn supply in the soil . _PROTEIN_ transcript levels were determined in root and shoot tissues of these plants by quantitative rt pcr analysis . as expected _PROTEIN_ transcripts were detected in wild type plants only . transcripts were detected consistently in the complemented mutants only and the steady state levels were higher in roots than in shoots . in roots transcript levels were not significantly different between constructs . in contrast in shoots the transcript levels were fold higher in pahhma lines than in and lines . the _PROTEIN_ zn deficiency phenotype can be rescued by _METHOD_ . wild type and _PROTEIN_ mutant a. thaliana plants as well as transgenic homozygous plants _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ under the control of and were grown on soil watered with tap water . _PROTEIN_ of in roots and shoots of the complemented lines . transgenic homozygous plants _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ under the control of and were grown hydroponically with zn . relative _PROTEIN_ levels of in roots and shoots are of three to four independent lines from one experiment representative of two independent biological experiments each including two to four plants per line . the data were analysed with an unpaired t test . statistically significant differences between means are indicated by different superscripted letters . rtl relative transcript level . because the _METHOD_ fusion protein was functional the complemented mutant transgenic lines were used to examine if each of the three promoters determined an identical _PROTEIN_ profile at the protein level . in all cases the _METHOD_ protein was _PROTEIN_ in the pericycle in roots . the protein localized in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ of cells in a non _PROTEIN_ fashion . performing a plasmolysis of the root cells confirmed the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ localization . localization of _METHOD_ fusion protein in a. thaliana . _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was imaged by confocal microscopy in roots of day old seedlings of homozygous _PROTEIN_ mutants _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ under the control of and promoters . wild type a. thaliana seedlings used as control . plasmolysis was performed on a line resulting in shrinkage of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . propidium iodide was used to stain the cell walls . images are representative of a minimum of three independent lines . dotted arrows identify the different root tissues c cortex e endodermis ep epidermis p pericycle x xylem . cross sections a c e g longitudinal sections b d f h i j . scale bars and . localization of _METHOD_ in a. halleri transgenics was also studied . because transforming a. halleri is a long and complex process only a. halleri lines _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ under the control of and could be generated as representatives of the two extreme modifications of the _PROTEIN_ promoter compared to a. thaliana . for these two promoters the _PROTEIN_ profile and sub cellular localization was identical to that observed in a. thaliana . it can be reasonably assumed that is also active in the pericycle of a. halleri roots . in addition _METHOD_ was observed in cells within the vascular bundle . localization of _METHOD_ fusion protein in a. halleri . _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was imaged by confocal microscopy in roots of a. halleri _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ under the control of and promoters and of wild type a. halleri as control . propidium iodide was used to stain the cell walls . images are representative of a minimum of two independent lines . dotted arrows identify the different root tissues c cortex e endodermis ep epidermis p pericycle x xylem . cross sections b longitudinal sections a c d. scale bars and . to determine how the _PROTEIN_ of under the control of each promoter contributed to zn and cd tolerance root growth was measured in day old seedlings _PROTEIN_ exposed for days on agar medium plates to the control condition zn excess and cd . in control conditions the root growth was identical for all genotypes . upon exposure to excess zn the root growth of all genotypes was reduced but the _PROTEIN_ mutant was more affected with a growth reduction compared to control conditions . the root growths of wild type and lines were similar and higher than _PROTEIN_ . and lines were the most tolerant with a higher root growth compared to the double mutant . in the presence of cd the root growth drastically _PROTEIN_ for all genotypes by about compared to control conditions . again the _PROTEIN_ mutant was the most affected and its growth almost stopped . the root growths of wild type and lines were similar and higher than for _PROTEIN_ . the root growth of lines was even higher higher than the double mutant . zn and cd tolerance in a. thaliana complemented lines . wild type and _PROTEIN_ mutant a. thaliana seedlings as well as transgenic homozygous seedlings _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ under the control of and were exposed to and . root growth values are and are representative of one experiment out of a total of three independent biological experiments each including seedlings per line/treatment and four to five independent lines . the data were analysed with a two way _PROTEIN_ test with log transformed values followed by tukey and kramer s multiple comparison tests . statistically significant differences between means within treatments are indicated by different superscripted letters . how the _PROTEIN_ of under the control of each promoter contributed to metal accumulation was also determined . zn and cd concentrations were measured in the roots and rosette leaves of wild type _PROTEIN_ mutant and complemented plants after cultivation for weeks in hoagland hydroponic medium containing either zn or cd . hoagland medium classically contains zn and at this zn concentration the growth of the _PROTEIN_ mutant was rescued it could flower and set seeds similarly to the wild type . a concentration of zn was optimal to distinguish the mutant from the wild type in these growth conditions and assess complementation by the _METHOD_ constructs . indeed at zn the _PROTEIN_ mutant displayed a zn deficiency phenotype whereas all complemented lines displayed a wild type phenotype . the _PROTEIN_ mutant accumulated about fold higher zn in roots and fold lower zn in shoots than the wild type respectively . in roots the complemented lines accumulated less zn than the mutant root zn accumulation was intermediate between wild type and mutant in pahhma and pahhma lines while the pahhma lines accumulated the smallest zn amount at a level similar to the wild type . in contrast zn accumulation in shoots was fold higher in the pahhma lines than in the _PROTEIN_ mutant and similar to the wild type . the pahhma and pahhma lines accumulated even more zn fold more than the _PROTEIN_ mutant and fold more than the wild type . identical observations were made upon cd exposure _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ in the _PROTEIN_ mutant restored cd accumulation in shoots and in pahhma and pahhma lines the cd levels were similar to wild type levels in roots and shoots . zn and cd accumulation in a. thaliana complemented lines . wild type and _PROTEIN_ mutant a. thaliana plants as well as transgenic homozygous plants _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ under the control of and were cultivated hydroponically with and . zn and cd concentrations were measured in root and rosette tissues collected from two to three plants per line . values are of four to five independent lines from one experiment and are representative of three independent experiments . the data were analysed with a two way _PROTEIN_ test with log transformed values followed by tukey and kramer s multiple comparison tests . statistically significant differences between means within each figure panel are indicated by different superscripted letters . to further examine how the _PROTEIN_ of under the control of each promoter contributed to zn translocation from roots to shoots the _PROTEIN_ level of four genes that respond to zn status in tissues was measured _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ encoding zn uptake transporters and _PROTEIN_ encoding an enzyme involved in the synthesis of the zn chelator nicotianamine . the four genes are up regulated by zn deficiency and down regulated by zn excess in a. thaliana . gene _PROTEIN_ in roots and shoots of plants hydroponically cultivated at zn for weeks was analysed by quantitative rt pcr . in roots for all four genes the steady state transcript levels were lower in the _PROTEIN_ mutant than in the wild type as expected the increased zn accumulation in roots of the mutant resulted in a down regulation of the genes . in roots _PROTEIN_ steady state transcript levels were higher in all complemented lines than in the wild type and the _PROTEIN_ mutant . in addition the steady state transcript levels of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were to fold higher in the and lines compared to the wild type and _PROTEIN_ mutant lines indicative of zn depletion in root tissues . _PROTEIN_ of zn responsive genes in roots of a. thaliana complemented lines . wild type and _PROTEIN_ mutant a. thaliana plants as well as transgenic homozygous plants _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ under the control of and were grown hydroponically with zn . relative _PROTEIN_ levels of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are presented as of three to four independent lines from one experiment representative of two independent biological experiments each including two to four plants per line . the data were analysed with an unpaired t test . statistically significant differences between means are indicated by different superscripted letters . rtl relative transcript level . in contrast in shoots all genes were more highly _PROTEIN_ in the _PROTEIN_ mutant compared to the wild type highlighting the major zn deficiency in shoots of the mutant . steady state transcript levels of all genes were _METHOD_ down regulated in complemented lines compared to the mutant . the steady state transcript levels of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in all complemented lines were similar to the wild type . interestingly the steady state transcript levels of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were higher although not significantly in shoots of the lines than in the other complemented lines . _PROTEIN_ of zn responsive genes in shoots of a. thaliana complemented lines . wild type and _PROTEIN_ mutant a. thaliana plants as well as transgenic homozygous plants _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ under the control of and were grown hydroponically with zn . relative _PROTEIN_ levels of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are presented as of three to four independent lines from one experiment representative of two independent biological experiments each including two to four plants per line . the data were analysed with an unpaired t test . statistically significant differences between means are indicated by different superscripted letters . rtl relative transcript level .
