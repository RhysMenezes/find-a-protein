vitamin a deficiency is a worldwide health problem . overexpression of the dnaj like zinc finger domain protein orange is a novel strategy for the _PROTEIN_ of pro vitamin a carotenoids in different staple crops to alleviate vad . in plants or triggers the differentiation from non pigmented _LOCATION_ into carotenoid accumulating _LOCATION_ . there are different reports on the subcellular localization of this protein in either chloroplasts or the _LOCATION_ both of which were supported by confocal observation and protein protein interaction results . in this work we studied the subcellular localization of or in the cotyledons of germinating seedlings whose _LOCATION_ were transitioning from non pigmented proplastids into carotenoid accumulating etioplasts in the dark and then into chloroplasts upon illumination . our western blot analysis identified two bands of the arabidopsis or protein from the chloroplast fraction of the mature leaves . we found that the full length ator was predominantly localized in the _LOCATION_ in etiolated cotyledons although its abundance _PROTEIN_ upon illumination . our bioinformatics analysis indicated a _LOCATION_ localization signal after the n terminal chloroplast transit peptide . when we substituted different n terminal regions of ator with the green _METHOD_ protein our confocal observations demonstrated that this nls was sufficient to target ator to the _LOCATION_ . our results demonstrate that ator is a dual targeted protein that _PROTEIN_ localizes in the _LOCATION_ in etiolated cotyledons .
because bai et al . reported a clear _METHOD_ signal of or _METHOD_ in the transgenic sweet potato callus where no chloroplasts existed and or orthologs were frequently demonstrated to function in transgenic calli . it is possible that or localizes and functions in the _LOCATION_ when chloroplasts are not well developed . in addition to confocal observations we also raised anti or antiserum and performed western blotting analysis in this work to confirm our postulation . our sequence comparison showed that or orthologs in all land plants share high sequence identity and possess the characteristic c terminal dnaj like zinc finger domain together with two transmembrane domains . a putative n terminal chloroplast transit peptide region was found in all orthologs except those from physcomitrella patens and selaginella moellendorffii probably because the sequences of these two orthologs were incomplete . for proteins that are imported into chloroplasts through the dependent pathway their n terminal sequences usually contain a critical twin arginine motif and the ctp regions prior to this rr motif are cleaved after importing _METHOD_ . from the sequence of ator we found three rr pairs and our online analysis suggested that the first pair was most likely to be such a motif . the relative molecular weight of the full length ator calculated from its deduced amino acid sequence is kda . when its ctp is removed the size of ator is kda . using a. thaliana wild type seedlings our western blotting analysis with a specific antiserum against or successfully identified two bands at approximately and kda from the total protein extract of mature leaves . the kda band was also found to be dominant in developing cotyledons before and after illumination whereas the kda band was barely detectable in etiolated cotyledons and was weakly detected in de etiolated cotyledons . we further isolated chloroplast and _LOCATION_ fractions from mature leaves . both the and kda bands of ator were found in the chloroplast not the _LOCATION_ fraction on our western blots suggesting that ator is a chloroplast protein in mature leaves . however in etiolated cotyledons our anti or antiserum clearly identified the full length ator in the _LOCATION_ preparation . we then illuminated the seedlings and purified the _LOCATION_ from cotyledons at different time point . as shown in fig . the abundance of the _LOCATION_ localized ator gradually _PROTEIN_ upon illumination . when etiolated seedlings were exposed to light for h only approximately of the original level of ator remained in the _LOCATION_ . our observation of the ator _METHOD_ and boor _METHOD_ transgenic plants also supported the _LOCATION_ localization of or . although ator was not detected in the _LOCATION_ preparation of mature leaves on our western blots we occasionally observed the or _METHOD_ signal in the _LOCATION_ as indicated by dapi staining of protoplasts prepared from the leaves of the homozygous transgenic lines of both constructs . this infers that or could also localizes to the _LOCATION_ in mature leaves . all these results encouraged us to search the sequence of or for possible targeting motifs . although most online _METHOD_ did not provide other suggestions on subcellular localization of ator the _PROTEIN_ subprogram of the psort package found a short region between ctp and the first transmembrane domain as a putative _LOCATION_ localization signal . the sequence of this nls region is also highly conserved among all or orthologs . therefore we transformed a. thaliana wt plants with _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ constructs for the overexpression of different truncations of ator with _METHOD_ fused to their n termini . for _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ fusion proteins the n terminal region of ator before and after the nls respectively was substituted with _METHOD_ . our confocal observation results showed that _METHOD_ localized in the _LOCATION_ but _METHOD_ fusion protein was in _LOCATION_ . this indicated that the nls is responsible for the _LOCATION_ localization of ator and also explained why the overexpressed or _METHOD_ fusion protein was targeted to chloroplasts and the _LOCATION_ not elsewhere in our confocal observation . the dnaj like zinc finger domain protein or is unique for its capability of inducing the transition from non pigmented _LOCATION_ into carotenoid accumulating ones such as etioplasts and chromoplasts . this transition is a tightly coordinated developmental process that requires a concerted regulation of both metabolic and structural scenarios . although or was recently demonstrated to interact with _PROTEIN_ and this interaction favors carotenoid biosynthesis . _PROTEIN_ is more likely to function after the transition has been triggered and or has been imported into chloroplasts . or might interact with some other elements such as transcription _PROTEIN_ to regulate _LOCATION_ development and carotenoid accumulation at the transcriptional level for which its _LOCATION_ localization is a prerequisite . our previous report on the protein protein interaction between or and _LOCATION_ in the _LOCATION_ supports this presumption . although this interaction is only found to regulate cell elongation and petiole growth it suggests that or might have different functions by interacting with different proteins during development . in our work we confirmed that or predominantly localizes in the _LOCATION_ in etiolated cotyledons . a search for its protein protein partner at this developmental stage should shed light on a better understanding of etioplast biogenesis .
