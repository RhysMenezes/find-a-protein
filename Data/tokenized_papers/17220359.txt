posttranslational lipid modifications are important for proper localization of many proteins in eukaryotic cells . however the functional interrelationships between lipid modification processes in plants remain unclear . here we demonstrate that the two heterotrimeric g protein subunits from arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are prenylated and _PROTEIN_ is s acylated . in wild type enhanced yellow _METHOD_ protein fused _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are associated with _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ with _PROTEIN_ associated with internal _LOCATION_ as well . both can be prenylated by either protein geranylgeranyltransferase i or protein farnesyltransferase . their _LOCATION_ localization is intact in mutants lacking pft activity and largely intact in mutants lacking pggt i activity but is disrupted in mutants lacking both pft and pggt i activity . unlike in mammals arabidopsis do not rely on functional for _LOCATION_ targeting . mutation of the sixth to last cysteine the putative s acylation acceptor site causes a dramatic change in _PROTEIN_ but not _PROTEIN_ localization pattern suggesting s acylation serves as an important additional signal for _PROTEIN_ to be targeted to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . domain swapping experiments suggest that a short charged sequence at the _PROTEIN_ c terminus contributes to _PROTEIN_ 's efficient _LOCATION_ targeting compared to _PROTEIN_ . our data show the large degree to which pft and pggt i can compensate for each other in plants and suggest that differential lipid modification plays an important regulatory role in plant protein localization .
_PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ contain a caal motif for prenylation . to determine if _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ serve as prenylation targets glutathione s transferase _PROTEIN_ fused proteins _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ as well as mutant proteins _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in which the prenyl cys was mutated to ser were induced and purified . arabidopsis prenyltransferases pft and pggt i were _PROTEIN_ and purified from yeast . the subunits of pft and pggt were copurified with the subunit fused in frame with _PROTEIN_ epitope at the c terminus . incubation of purified _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ with different combinations of enzyme and substrate showed that the two subunits are not only geranylgeranylated by pggt i but also farnesylated by pft while the mutated _METHOD_ are not prenylated . the results also show that arabidopsis pggt i can utilize farnesyl pyrophosphate _METHOD_ albeit with a much weaker signal detected . that signals were not detected when no pggt i was added or when _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was incubated with the purified pggt i confirmed that prenylation of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ requires the conserved fourth to last cys and the signals from the other reactions are not due to nonspecific substrate affinity but due to enzymatic activities . to demonstrate that the lack of prenylation affects the localization of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were fused to _METHOD_ at the n terminus under control of the promoter of cauliflower mosaic virus . stable transgenic arabidopsis plants for all the constructs as well as the _METHOD_ vector alone were assessed by _METHOD_ confocal microscopy . without other constraints nonnuclear proteins within about kd have been shown to freely enter into the _LOCATION_ through the _LOCATION_ pore complex . _METHOD_ and its variant fluorophores are _LOCATION_ proteins that can go into the _LOCATION_ but not _LOCATION_ . for the _METHOD_ vector alone a bright signal was detected in the _LOCATION_ perinuclear cytoplasm cytoplasmic strands and the cortical cytoplasm that was pressed by the large _LOCATION_ against the cell wall . after plasmolysis _METHOD_ signal was detected in the condensed cytoplasm and _LOCATION_ as shown in a guard cell for its easily recognizable shape in an overlay of differential interference contrast and confocal image . _METHOD_ signals of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ were detected as sharp thin lines surrounding the cell periphery suggesting that _PROTEIN_ is associated with the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . plasmolysis further confirmed that signals are confined to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . in _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ plants the _METHOD_ pattern is different from both _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ vector alone . while most of the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ is detected in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ there is considerable signal associated with more internal structures especially some bright small and motile particles . the dynamic feature of these brightly fluorescing particles is visible in a supplemental movie . after plasmolysis _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ displays aggregates of bright spots and endomembrane localization . to see if these bright dots are _LOCATION_ or _LOCATION_ associated structures we crossed _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ plants with plants containing the _LOCATION_ marker fused to cyan _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ . _METHOD_ plants alone exhibit weaker growth . seeds from crosses between _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ plants and _METHOD_ can germinate on hygromycin plates but can not initiate true leaves . nevertheless using the expanded cotyledons _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was indeed detected associated with _LOCATION_ . a consistent pattern of the merged yellow color between the red _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and green _METHOD_ indicating that _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ colocalizes with _METHOD_ but does not overlap completely . _METHOD_ was shown to localize at the cis/medial side of the _LOCATION_ stacks . thus it appears that _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ is most likely associated with the trans side of the _LOCATION_ and possibly with the trans _LOCATION_ network suggesting _PROTEIN_ is transported to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ through the vesicular _LOCATION_ trafficking pathway like the human g proteins . both _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ showed similar localization patterns to that of _METHOD_ vector alone indicating that prenylation is critical for _LOCATION_ localization of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . we crossed _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ plants to ggb plp and _LOCATION_ mutants to see if the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ distribution pattern is altered in prenylation mutants . localization of _PROTEIN_ does not change in _LOCATION_ or _PROTEIN_ suggesting they are primarily prenylated by pggt i in vivo and loss of pft function does not affect their prenylation . in ggb _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ still retain most of their _LOCATION_ association indicating that loss of pggt i function is largely compensated by pft in agreement with the results from the in vitro assay . however weakly fluorescing _LOCATION_ can be detected in the projections of multiple stacks for both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and for _PROTEIN_ there are fewer fluorescing _LOCATION_ stacks indicating that a portion of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ is not prenylated and not _LOCATION_ associated in the absence of pggt i further suggesting that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are preferably prenylated by pggt i but not by pft in vivo . in plp mutants cytoplasmic strands and _LOCATION_ were clearly visualized for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ indicating that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ is significantly distributed in the _LOCATION_ when both pft and pggt i activities are abolished . to show the _LOCATION_ versus _LOCATION_ partitioning of the arabidopsis g protein subunits we prepared total _LOCATION_ and soluble fractions of protein from leaves of the above mentioned overexpression plants resolved on _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and visualized by immunoblotting with antibodies specific for green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ . consistent with confocal imaging _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ is detected in the _LOCATION_ fraction in both wild type and _LOCATION_ mutants and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ is present in the _LOCATION_ fraction . due to the observed lower _METHOD_ intensity in the ggb and plp mutant background times more protein was loaded for _PROTEIN_ ggb and times more protein was loaded for _PROTEIN_ plp . in ggb mutants the majority of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ remains in the _LOCATION_ fraction demonstrating that the loss of pggt i function does not severely alter its localization . however in a blot with longer exposure weak signal of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ is detected in the soluble fraction in ggb but not in wild type or in _LOCATION_ in agreement with the faintly stained _LOCATION_ showing in the projection of the confocal image of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ ggb . in plp mutants _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ is significantly detected in the soluble fraction although a portion still remains in the _LOCATION_ fraction . the remaining _LOCATION_ association of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in plp is resistant to m of nacl and m of wash suggesting that it is not due to peripheral protein protein interaction but by stable _LOCATION_ association . a similar immunoblotting pattern is observed for _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in plp ggb and _LOCATION_ backgrounds . the farnesylation of mammalian was shown to be critical but not sufficient to target to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . farnesylation is sufficient to target to the _LOCATION_ but it requires the presence of to target to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . to see if is necessary for arabidopsis to localize to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ we crossed arabidopsis plants _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ with both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is a t dna insertion that results in no detectable protein in western blots and _PROTEIN_ is a splice site mutation that introduces a stop codon early in the transcript suggesting both are null alleles . no alteration of localization pattern was observed for either _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ or _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ mutants suggesting that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ can localize to the _LOCATION_ solely through their lipid modification . in yeast an adjacent cys to the prenyl cys has been shown to be palmitoylated and palmitoylation occurs after prenylation . in arabidopsis there are two additional cys to the prenyl cys in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and one of them is separated by one amino acid upstream of the prenyl cys . to see if this cys is subject to acylation we conducted point mutation analysis by mutating the cys at the position for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and at the position for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ to ser . because farnesylated but nonacylated human was only sufficiently targeted to the _LOCATION_ binary vectors containing _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ were either infiltrated alone or coinfiltrated with an _LOCATION_ localization marker _METHOD_ hdel into nicotiana benthamiana leaf epidermal cells . as also shown in stable transgenic plants wild type _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in transient assays shows many bright spots . these bright spots were embedded within the _LOCATION_ network but do not colocalize with the _LOCATION_ marker . the weakly fluorescing signal in the background suggests that unlike farnesylated human geranylgeranylated _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ does not significantly accumulate in the _LOCATION_ and its delivery from _LOCATION_ to trans _LOCATION_ is a rapid process . _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ showed a similar localization pattern to that of wild type _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . stable transformed arabidopsis plants with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and the one that was crossed with _METHOD_ also showed a similar pattern to that of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ suggesting the mutated cys is not required for _PROTEIN_ 's proper targeting . in contrast _PROTEIN_ displayed a distinct pattern from that of wild type _PROTEIN_ . _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ is associated with internal _LOCATION_ in both transient assays and stable transformed arabidopsis plants while wild type _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ presents only sharp lines of signal circumventing the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . like _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ arabidopsis plants with _METHOD_ are extremely unhealthy when grown on hygromycin plates and not every cell showed both signals . within those cells that do detect both signals the bright spots in the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ were also shown to be associated with _LOCATION_ in the same manner as that observed in _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . the fatty acid analog bromo palmitate _PROTEIN_ is known as a palmitoylation inhibitor both in vivo and in vitro . _PROTEIN_ blocks the synthesis of acyl coa and also interferes with the transfer of fatty acids to the thiol group . when _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ were infiltrated into n. benthamiana along with _PROTEIN_ a similarly disrupted pattern to that of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was displayed while _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ localization of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ that contains transmembrane domains was not altered by the same treatment nor was the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ mock treatment with dimethyl sulfoxide _METHOD_ alone . it appears that _PROTEIN_ treatment does not alter _PROTEIN_ 's localization consistent with the results from the point mutation . the disruption of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ localization of _PROTEIN_ by both mutation of the putative s acylated cys and s acylation inhibitor suggests that wild type _PROTEIN_ is s acylated and s acylation serves as an important second signal for _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ targeting of the prenylated protein . many prenylation targets including _PROTEIN_ and k rasb have a polybasic proximal domain that either promotes prenylation efficiency or serves as a second _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ targeting signal . a polybasic region with a net positive charge of four or more is required to function as a _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ targeting motif . a polybasic sequence with six lys was reported to be able to facilitate palmitoylation without requiring previous prenylation suggesting the polybasic domain indeed serves as a _LOCATION_ targeting signal . a polybasic domain with arg and three lys residues in _PROTEIN_ has been shown to increase pggt i prenylation efficiency by an order of magnitude in vitro . neither _PROTEIN_ nor _PROTEIN_ has a long proximal polybasic domain as does _PROTEIN_ . however _PROTEIN_ does have three more charged amino acid residues in the preceding hypervariable region than _PROTEIN_ . we suspected this might be responsible for the observed different localization patterns between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . we swapped the hypervariable regions of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ proximal to the caax boxes and observed subcellular localization patterns of the resulting _METHOD_ tagged proteins _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in n. benthamiana leaf epidermal cells and arabidopsis transformants . _PROTEIN_ was associated with _LOCATION_ and other internal _LOCATION_ as seen in s acylation diminished _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ while wild type _PROTEIN_ was only detected on the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ strongly suggesting that the basic residues contribute to the efficient targeting of _PROTEIN_ . stable transformation of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ also displays more fluorescing internal signals than _PROTEIN_ . in contrast the localization pattern of _PROTEIN_ in stable transformants is very different from that of wild type _PROTEIN_ but very similar to that of _PROTEIN_ with _METHOD_ signal _PROTEIN_ detected in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ suggesting that the added short basic sequence possibly promotes both prenylation and s acylation process .
