the signal mediated and spatially controlled assembly and dynamics of actin are crucial for _PROTEIN_ shape motility and tip growth of eukaryotic cells . we report that a novel armadillo repeat protein in arabidopsis thaliana armadillo _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is of fundamental importance for _PROTEIN_ growth and f actin organization in tip growing pollen tubes . _PROTEIN_ is specifically _PROTEIN_ in the vegetative cell of pollen as well as in the egg cell . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ fusion proteins accumulate most notably in pollen tube tips and partially colocalize with f actin in the shank of pollen tubes . _PROTEIN_ knockout results in a highly disorganized actin _LOCATION_ growth depolarization and ultimately tube growth arrest . tip localized _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ is spatially shifted toward the future site of tip growth indicating a role of _PROTEIN_ in the signaling network controlling tip growth and regulating actin organization . after the pollen tube discharges its contents into the receptive synergid _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ colocalizes with emerging f actin structures near the site of sperm cell fusion suggesting additional participation in the mechanism of sperm cell tracking toward the female gametes . the variable localization of _PROTEIN_ in the cytoplasm the _LOCATION_ and at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ however indicates a multifunctional role like that of catenin/armadillo and the catenins .
a previous analysis of ests derived from isolated wheat egg cells led to the discovery of a novel transcript encoding an arm repeat containing protein which was found to be _PROTEIN_ exclusively in egg cells and anthers . blast searches revealed significant similarity to hypothetical arm repeat containing proteins from rice and arabidopsis . besides the arm repeats the proteins do not contain any recognizable protein motif or any similarity to known proteins therefore they were termed aro proteins . we found _GENE_ to be a member of a small arabidopsis protein family designated _PROTEIN_ to _PROTEIN_ . all four proteins are encoded by a single exon with a length of between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ amino acid residues and a predicted molecular _METHOD_ of to kd respectively . while _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are very similar to _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ represents the most divergent member of the protein family . however all four proteins share a unique primary structure comprising two conserved arm repeat containing domains _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ which are separated by a highly divergent spacer region . a domain of to amino acids is located at the n terminus and a short stretch of to amino acids follows _PROTEIN_ at the c terminus . based solely on sequence homology only up to three bona fide arm repeats were recognized in each of the four aro proteins in arabidopsis . nevertheless when we combined secondary structure and pfam predictions the presence of at least six complete and three incomplete putative arm repeats was indicated . despite the low sequence conservation of some of the putative arm repeats they possess a typical three helix composition and are predicted to form an elongated superhelical structure similar to that of importin . we also found a small family of four aro like hypothetical proteins to be present in the rice genome . furthermore we identified aro like proteins in the genomes of zea mays medicago truncatula vitis vinifera lotus japonicus populus trichocarpa and the moss physcomitrella patens as well as in the est data collections of picea and pinus species while we could not find any aro like proteins in chlamydomonas yeast or animal . the unrooted phylogenetic tree generated with aro like proteins reveals that monocotyledonous dicotyledonous gymnosperm and moss aro like proteins form individual subclades with the exception of arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ . when we compared the predicted secondary structure and putative phosphorylation sites of arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ with those of its closest relatives from other plant species we found the overall architecture as well as several predicted phosphorylation sites to be conserved . rt pcr _PROTEIN_ studies revealed that arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ is not _PROTEIN_ in vegetative tissues but only in tissues containing the male and female gametophytes . transcripts of _PROTEIN_ were detected in buds and flowers as well as in dissected anthers and ovaries . by contrast the other members of the gene family are _PROTEIN_ in all tissues tested . to provide a more detailed view of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ during female and male gametophyte development homozygous transgenic lines were generated _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ under the control of the _PROTEIN_ promoter . gus activity was not detected during early stages of ovule development but was restricted to mature egg cells of female gametophytes . while weak gus activity was still detectable in zygotes it was absent in two celled proembryos . during anther development gus activity was first detected at stage of flower development when pollen reached the trinucleate stage . strong gus activity was observed in mature pollen grains as well as in in vitro germinated pollen tubes . this was confirmed by quantitative rt pcr when relative _PROTEIN_ levels of _PROTEIN_ were determined using eukaryotic transcription initiation _PROTEIN_ as a reference housekeeping gene . during anther maturation _PROTEIN_ transcript levels increased significantly and the highest transcript levels were found in mature pollen and in pollen tubes h after in vitro germination . rt pcr analysis using mature pollen but excluding anther tissues revealed that _PROTEIN_ is the only member of the gene family _PROTEIN_ in pollen . by contrast all four aros appear to be _PROTEIN_ in the egg cell as indicated by affymetrix genechip experiments using _METHOD_ labeled amplified crna from isolated arabidopsis egg cells . _PROTEIN_ to _PROTEIN_ seem to be _PROTEIN_ more strongly than _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ related _PROTEIN_ a gene that was recently shown to be _PROTEIN_ in egg cells by in situ hybridization . three independent salk t dna insertion lines were considered for functional analysis of _PROTEIN_ . the mutant alleles were named _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . the homozygous offspring of the t dna insertion lines _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ did not show any phenotype in either vegetative development or reproduction . by contrast no homozygous plant was obtained among the _PROTEIN_ progeny . the mutant allele segregated in a ratio of _PROTEIN_ indicating a gametophytic effect . reciprocal crosses of heterozygous _PROTEIN_ with the wild type revealed that _PROTEIN_ was only transmitted by the female gametophyte and never by the male suggesting a functional role of _PROTEIN_ in either pollen development or postpollination events . cytological analysis of diamidino phenylindole stained mature pollen grains from heterozygous _PROTEIN_ plants did not show any distinctive feature compared with wild type pollen . the size and shape of these pollen grains were normal and both the vegetative _LOCATION_ and the two sperm cell _LOCATION_ were present . however of pollen from _PROTEIN_ plants germinated in vitro displayed a severe phenotype . the pollen tubes either burst immediately after in vitro germination or were short and plump with large _LOCATION_ like structures . statistical evaluation revealed that of _PROTEIN_ pollen tubes appeared phenotypically similar to wild type controls while of these tubes had a short and plump phenotype _PROTEIN_ . the diameter of _PROTEIN_ pollen tubes ranged from to with an average of while wild type pollen tubes were to in diameter . another of _PROTEIN_ pollen grains burst immediately after germination . measurement of tube lengths after and h of in vitro germination revealed that the growth rate of _PROTEIN_ pollen tubes was significantly retarded . at h after in vitro germination the average length of wild type pollen tubes was while _PROTEIN_ pollen tubes were between and long with an average length of . successful complementation verified the causal relationship between the observed pollen tube phenotype and the _PROTEIN_ allele and demonstrated that the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ fusion protein that we used is functional in planta . pollen tube phenotypes of wild type and _PROTEIN_ pollen observed h after in vitro germination average length of wild type and _PROTEIN_ pollen tubes measured after and h of in vitro germination in vivo germination of pollen from _PROTEIN_ plants was analyzed by aniline blue staining of pistils at h after limited hand pollination . pollen tubes of _PROTEIN_ plants were visible in the transmitting tract of pistils as were pollen tubes of the wild type controls . closer examination revealed that only pollen tubes with wild type morphology were able to grow through the style toward the ovules . phenotypic short and plump pollen tubes were only found on the surface of the papillae which indicates that _PROTEIN_ pollen are in principle able to adhere hydrate and germinate in vivo . however mutant pollen tubes failed to enter the cell wall of stigmatic cells and were often observed to form protuberances at the tube tip . as the _PROTEIN_ allele is not transmitted by the male parent we conclude that _PROTEIN_ plants will become fertilized exclusively by pollen with a wild type genetic background because _PROTEIN_ pollen tubes are impaired in growing into the stigma . to examine the cause for the _PROTEIN_ pollen tube morphology we fixed in vitro germinated pollen tubes stained them with rhodamine phalloidin and analyzed the actin _LOCATION_ using confocal laser scanning microscopy _PROTEIN_ . wild type pollen grains contained _PROTEIN_ actin cables which were strictly oriented toward the germination pore . in the shank of wild type pollen tubes actin cables were oriented in parallel bundles along the growth axis of the tube . strikingly the actin _LOCATION_ of _PROTEIN_ pollen tubes was severely disorganized . short fragments of randomly oriented actin bundles were visible in the pollen grains of germinated pollen . the bulk of very short _PROTEIN_ pollen tubes revealed a disorganized meshwork of short actin filaments throughout the tube . in the rare case of longer _PROTEIN_ pollen tubes short bundles of randomly oriented and occasionally intertwining actin filaments were visible in the shank of the pollen tube and in the tip . growth retardation and loss of _PROTEIN_ tip growth of _PROTEIN_ pollen tubes thus coincide with the loss of long and parallel actin bundles along the growth axis of the zygote together with an accumulation of short and disordered actin filaments at the tip of the pollen tubes . we generated transgenic lines _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein under the control of the _PROTEIN_ promoter _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and evaluated homozygous progeny for the time frame of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and subcellular localization of the fusion protein . in the female gametophyte _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein was restricted to mature egg cells consistent with results obtained from _PROTEIN_ gus lines . while the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was found in the cytoplasm of egg cells we never detected any _METHOD_ in the egg _LOCATION_ or in the _LOCATION_ . after the first asymmetric cell division of the zygote _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was no longer detectable . analysis of pollen grains revealed that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ is located in the cytoplasm of the vegetative cell . furthermore intense _METHOD_ was detected in the _LOCATION_ of the vegetative cell while _LOCATION_ and cytoplasm of sperm cells completely lacked _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . both cytoplasmic and _LOCATION_ localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were also observed in the majority of transiently transformed epidermal onion cells _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ under the control of the maize ubiquitin promoter . however of the transiently transformed cells showed _METHOD_ _METHOD_ in the cytoplasm but not in the _LOCATION_ . furthermore the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein appeared to be located exclusively at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ in of all analyzed cells . this variation in subcellular localization was not observed in arabidopsis eggs or in pollen _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ nor was it seen in transiently transformed epidermal spring onion cells _PROTEIN_ an _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein or the _METHOD_ control . slightly grainy _METHOD_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was visible throughout the cytoplasm of in vitro germinated pollen together with several fluorescing spots . some filament like _METHOD_ structures were usually visible especially in the central part of pollen tubes parallel to the axis of growth . as in ungerminated pollen _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was present in the vegetative _LOCATION_ while sperm cells were free of any _METHOD_ . strikingly _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ appeared to accumulate at the very tip of the germinated pollen tube . this accumulation was present in all pollen tubes analyzed although the _METHOD_ intensity was found to vary and filled to of the tip . moreover a change in the growth direction of pollen tube tips was always accompanied by a relocation of _METHOD_ toward the future growth site of the tips . we examined the colocalization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and actin by _PROTEIN_ after the actin _LOCATION_ of in vitro germinated _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ pollen tubes was fixed and stained . _METHOD_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was weaker but still visible after fixation and colocalized along longitudinal bundles of actin filaments in the shank of the pollen tube with some shorter actin filaments in the apical region of the tube tip . however the subcellular distribution of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ did not completely cover the labeled actin filaments but appeared somewhat discontinuous and several fluorescing spots did not show any colocalization with actin . also without fixation we observed only some filament like green _METHOD_ structures occurring particularly in the central part of pollen tubes . we verified the partial colocalization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and actin filaments by treating in vitro germinated _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ pollen tubes with latrunculin b previously shown to be a potent inhibitor of actin polymerization in pollen tubes . effective depolymerization of f actin resulted in scattered weak red _METHOD_ visible in rhodamine phalloidin stained pollen tubes . the slightly enriched staining in the apical region presumably represents g actin or patches of fragmented f actin . the disruption of actin filaments was accompanied by the disappearance of the filament like _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signal in the shank of pollen tubes contrary to control pollen tubes treated with the solvent _METHOD_ only . the green _METHOD_ in the apex of latb treated pollen tubes appeared weaker and more dispersed compared with that of untreated pollen tubes indicating a correlation between the apical dynamic f actin and the spatial restriction of _PROTEIN_ within the tip . colocalization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ with actin remaining after latb treatment was visible in the apex and in some spots in the shank of the tube . however most of the green _METHOD_ spots in the cytoplasm did not colocalize with actin . we investigated a putative _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and vesicle associated localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ by the use of the styril dye an established tracer of endocytotic _LOCATION_ traffic in plant cells and brefeldin a an efficient inhibitor of vesicular secretion in plant cells . in vitro germinated _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ pollen tubes were incubated for min with the fixable derivative to allow the visualization of parts of the endomembrane system together with actin filaments . again the filament and speckle like fluorescing signals of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ localized along some actin filaments . however there was no colocalization of labeled _LOCATION_ compartments and the fluorescing spots of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . interestingly the localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ changed significantly upon bfa treatment . the tip focused accumulation of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ disappeared and the filament like distribution of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ changed into a punctiform _METHOD_ of variable intensity and size visible throughout the pollen tube . like a string of pearls _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was visible throughout the pollen tubes but colocalized rather infrequently with _PROTEIN_ actin cables which were not significantly altered upon bfa treatment . however the punctiform _METHOD_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ never colocalized with subapical stained bfa induced _LOCATION_ aggregations . to investigate the localization of _PROTEIN_ and actin in the egg apparatus before fertilization we stained the actin _LOCATION_ of emasculated wild type and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ arabidopsis ovules with rhodamine phalloidin . the synergids exhibited strong staining of actin filaments with a _PROTEIN_ orientation along their longitudinal axis . by contrast egg cells only exhibited weak actin staining essentially at the apical cortex . besides being a matter of detection sensitivity mature arabidopsis egg cells may thus either lack extensive actin filaments or could be predominantly occupied by dynamic f actin . to analyze the distribution of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ during the fertilization process we performed controlled hand pollination of emasculated wild type pistils using _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ pollen and vice versa . in _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ labeled egg cells the _METHOD_ appeared to alter soon after pollination but before fertilization took place . one hour after hand pollination we observed a stronger punctiform _METHOD_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ shifting toward the transvacuolar strands and to the micropylar region of the egg cell . however we could not detect ancillary actin filaments in these regions . we detected the first pollen tubes arriving at the ovules h after pollination which is consistent with previous observations . the typical distribution of male derived _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in wild type ovules after the pollen tube has released its contents into the receptive synergid is shown in figures and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . the _METHOD_ is visible throughout the degenerating synergid and spreads into the gap between the egg and the central cell forming a _METHOD_ hook covering the _PROTEIN_ end of the egg cell . the _LOCATION_ of both the egg and the central cell are positioned in this area the suggested fusion site of male and female gametes . in another set of experiments we performed crosses between _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ pistils and pollen where the sperm cells were labeled with _METHOD_ a male gamete specific histone variant fused to monomeric red _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ . indeed we observed the sperm cells to migrate into the _PROTEIN_ end of the degenerating synergid toward the predicted fusion site . after staining actin filaments of wild type ovules pollinated with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ pollen at the time of pollen tube discharge and sperm cell migration we observed significant cytoskeletal modifications in the degenerating synergid . the prominent actin filaments visible in the lumen of synergids before pollen tube arrival disappeared whereas _METHOD_ f actin aggregated in the micropylar region . in addition we detected a narrow band of f actin at the _PROTEIN_ end of the degenerating synergid the area where sperm cells migrate toward their fusion sites . pollen tube derived _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ filled the lumen of the receptive synergid . _METHOD_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was also visible in the shank of the pollen tube at areas of strong f actin staining . in the egg apparatus there was no colocalization of the prominent f actin aggregates at the micropylar region with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . however _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ colocalized with the narrow f actin band at the _PROTEIN_ end of the degenerating synergid .
