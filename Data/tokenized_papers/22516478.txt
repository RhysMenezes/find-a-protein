the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ associated degradation _LOCATION_ is a highly conserved mechanism to remove misfolded _LOCATION_ proteins from the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . while many of the individual components of the _LOCATION_ machinery are well characterized in yeast and mammals our knowledge of a plant _LOCATION_ process is rather limited . here we report a functional study of an arabidopsis homolog _PROTEIN_ of an _LOCATION_ luminal lectin that recognizes a unique asparagine linked glycan on misfolded proteins . we discovered that _PROTEIN_ is an _LOCATION_ localized glycoprotein that is co _PROTEIN_ with many known/predicted _LOCATION_ chaperones . a t dna insertional _PROTEIN_ t mutation blocks the degradation of a structurally imperfect yet biochemically competent brassinosteroid receptor _PROTEIN_ causing its increased accumulation in the _LOCATION_ and its consequent leakage to the cell surface responsible for restoring the br sensitivity and suppressing the dwarfism of the _PROTEIN_ mutant . in addition we identified a missense mutation in _PROTEIN_ in a recently discovered _LOCATION_ mutant _METHOD_ mutagenized _PROTEIN_ suppressor . moreover we showed that _PROTEIN_ t also inhibits the _LOCATION_ of _PROTEIN_ another _LOCATION_ retained br receptor and a misfolded _PROTEIN_ a _PROTEIN_ like receptor for the bacterial translation elongation _PROTEIN_ ef tu . furthermore we found that _PROTEIN_ interacted biochemically and genetically with _PROTEIN_ an arabidopsis homolog of the yeast _PROTEIN_ known to collaborate with to select _LOCATION_ clients . taken together our results demonstrated a functional role of _PROTEIN_ in a plant _LOCATION_ process that degrades misfolded receptor like kinases .
using and the human os as query blast searches against the entire arabidopsis genome identified a potential homologous gene which consists of eight exons and seven introns and encodes a polypeptide _PROTEIN_ of amino acid residues with a predicted hydrophobic signal sequence at its n terminus . _PROTEIN_ is significantly smaller than its counterparts in yeast and mammals due to its lacking of the large c terminal extensions of but is predicted to contain the mrh domain which is known to be crucial for the _LOCATION_ lectin function in yeast and mammals . the predicted mrh domain shares and identity with those of and os and contains the eight amino acid residues that are directly involved in sugar binding . several previous genome wide gene _PROTEIN_ analyses showed that was up regulated by _LOCATION_ stresses and was co _PROTEIN_ with many arabidopsis genes encoding known or putative _LOCATION_ chaperones including _PROTEIN_ and protein disulfide isomerases _PROTEIN_ . consistently with these gene _PROTEIN_ studies our immunoblot analysis revealed that a short term treatment of arabidopsis seedlings with tunicamycin an n glycan biosynthesis inhibitor that causes severe _LOCATION_ stresses significantly increased the _PROTEIN_ abundance whereas a prolonged tm treatment led to detection of a fast moving _PROTEIN_ band on protein gel . the molecular weight difference between the fast and slow moving _PROTEIN_ bands is kd which is consistent with its three predicted n glycan sites . unlike the yeast _PROTEIN_ lacks the his asp glu leu _LOCATION_ retrieval sequence but our confocal analysis of an _PROTEIN_ fusion protein tagged at its c terminus with green _METHOD_ protein _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ which was transiently _PROTEIN_ in tobacco leaves indicated that _PROTEIN_ is an _LOCATION_ localized protein because its _METHOD_ pattern overlapped with the _METHOD_ signal of a widely used _LOCATION_ marker protein a hdel tagged red _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ . the _LOCATION_ localization of _PROTEIN_ was further confirmed by a simple biochemical assay using the endoglycosylase h that cleaves high mannose type n glycans of _LOCATION_ localized glycoproteins but can not remove _LOCATION_ processed complex type n glycans . as shown in the n glycans of _PROTEIN_ can be efficiently cleaved by endo h converting the slow moving _PROTEIN_ band to a fast moving band that exhibits the same electrophoretic mobility as the non glycosylated _PROTEIN_ band of the tm treated seedlings . to investigate the physiological functions of _PROTEIN_ we identified a t dna insertional mutant _PROTEIN_ from the ecker signal t dna _PROTEIN_ database which carries a t dna insertion in the middle of the predicted sixth exon . an immunoblot analysis with an affinity purified anti _PROTEIN_ antibody which easily detected _PROTEIN_ in seedlings of both wild type and _PROTEIN_ failed to detect its presence in the t dna insertional mutant suggesting that _PROTEIN_ t is likely a null mutant . although the _PROTEIN_ t mutant is indistinguishable from the wild type control when grown under standard laboratory conditions it was hypersensitive to tm implying a role in coping with _LOCATION_ stresses that often lead to overaccumulation of misfolded proteins in the _LOCATION_ . to directly test a role of _PROTEIN_ in the arabidopsis _LOCATION_ system we crossed the _PROTEIN_ t mutation into the _PROTEIN_ mutant whose dwarf phenotype was previously shown to be caused by _LOCATION_ retention and _LOCATION_ of the mutant br receptor _PROTEIN_ . if _PROTEIN_ was a component of the arabidopsis _LOCATION_ machinery that degrades the mutant br receptor we would expect that the _PROTEIN_ t mutation should block the _LOCATION_ of _PROTEIN_ and significantly increase the _PROTEIN_ abundance . indeed as shown in the _PROTEIN_ protein abundance is significantly higher in _PROTEIN_ t _PROTEIN_ than in _PROTEIN_ . to eliminate the possibility that the elevated _PROTEIN_ level in _PROTEIN_ t _PROTEIN_ is caused by increased biosynthesis of the mutant br receptor we performed a cycloheximide chase experiment . we treated week old seedlings of both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ t _PROTEIN_ mutants with chx and analyzed the _PROTEIN_ abundance by immunoblot with an anti _PROTEIN_ antibody . as shown in the _PROTEIN_ protein is relatively unstable with a half life of h. by contrast a significant amount of the mutant br receptor remained in the _PROTEIN_ t _PROTEIN_ double mutant h after the chx treatment . we concluded that the increased _PROTEIN_ abundance in the _PROTEIN_ t _PROTEIN_ mutant is likely caused by reduced degradation rather than by increased biosynthesis supporting a functional role of _PROTEIN_ in the _LOCATION_ of the mutant br receptor . the _PROTEIN_ t mutation also nicely suppressed the dwarf phenotype of the br receptor mutant . compared to _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ t _PROTEIN_ double mutant has a much larger rosette with longer petioles at the seedling stage longer hypocotyls in the dark and taller inflorescence _METHOD_ when grown in soil . we suspected that this is likely caused by leakage of a small amount of _PROTEIN_ protein from the _LOCATION_ as a result of saturating the _PROTEIN_ retention system by overaccumulated mutant br receptor in the folding compartment . if this were true we would expect that the _PROTEIN_ t mutation should at least partially restore br sensitivity to the br insensitive dwarf mutant . as shown in increasing concentrations of brassinolide had little effect on the root elongation of the _PROTEIN_ seedlings but inhibited the root growth of the wild type as well as the _PROTEIN_ t _PROTEIN_ mutant . the restored br sensitivity can also be detected biochemically . a h treatment of week old seedlings with bl had little effect on the phosphorylation status of _PROTEIN_ a very robust biochemical marker of active br signaling but led to rapid dephosphorylation of _PROTEIN_ in both the wild type and the _PROTEIN_ t _PROTEIN_ mutant . additional support for our leakage theory came from an immunoblot experiment with total protein extracts treated with endo h. if the restored br sensitivity was caused by a small amount of leaked mutant receptor from the _LOCATION_ we should be able to detect their presence by the endo h assay as their n glycans are no longer the h type and are therefore resistant to the endo h catalyzed deglycosylation . indeed a small but significant amount of _PROTEIN_ carrying the endo h resistant c type n glycan was detected in the _PROTEIN_ t _PROTEIN_ mutant . consistently overexpression of _PROTEIN_ a land plant specific crt that functions as a rate limiting _PROTEIN_ for the _LOCATION_ retention of _PROTEIN_ nullified the suppressive effect of the _PROTEIN_ t mutation on the _PROTEIN_ mutant as the _PROTEIN_ t _PROTEIN_ transgenic mutants are morphologically similar to the _PROTEIN_ single mutant . an immunoblot assay showed that _PROTEIN_ overexpression had little effect on the _PROTEIN_ abundance but significantly reduced the amount of _PROTEIN_ proteins carrying the endo h resistant c type n glycan . the involvement of _PROTEIN_ in the _LOCATION_ of _PROTEIN_ was further confirmed by two additional experiments . the first was a complementation assay to ensure that the mutation for suppressing the _PROTEIN_ dwarfism is indeed the _PROTEIN_ t mutation instead of other potential mutations in the t dna line . we introduced a genomic _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgene which carries the native promoter all seven introns exons the amino acid coding segment of the eighth exon with its last codon fused to the open reading frame of a _METHOD_ gene and the terminator of the pea rbsc gene into the _PROTEIN_ t _PROTEIN_ mutant . as shown in the introduction of the _METHOD_ transgene led to production of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and restored the _PROTEIN_ like dwarfism to the _PROTEIN_ t _PROTEIN_ double mutant . consistently with the observed phenotypic rescue immunoblot analysis revealed that the _PROTEIN_ abundance was significantly reduced to that of the _PROTEIN_ mutant in the transgenic _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ t _PROTEIN_ lines . the second support for an essential role of _PROTEIN_ in the _LOCATION_ of _PROTEIN_ came from our mapping and sequence analysis of the mutant that was previously identified by our secondary screen for arabidopsis _LOCATION_ mutants . pcr based genetic mapping with genomic dnas of f seedlings derived from a mapping cross of the _PROTEIN_ mutant in a columbia ecotype with a _PROTEIN_ mutant in the wassilewskija ecotype located the _PROTEIN_ locus in a genomic region that contains _PROTEIN_ gene . subsequent sequence analysis revealed a g to a single nucleotide polymorphism in the _PROTEIN_ gene which changes an absolutely conserved glycine residue to glutamic acid . this detected snp was subsequently converted to a derived cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence marker that was used to confirm a tight genetic linkage between the g a mutation and the _PROTEIN_ phenotype in several f mapping populations . interestingly despite the _PROTEIN_ that the mutated gly residue is absolutely conserved among mammalian os and several predicted plant _PROTEIN_ the mutation is a rather weak suppressor of the _PROTEIN_ mutant as the _PROTEIN_ mutant is only slightly larger and has a less compact rosette with a slightly taller stature compared to the _PROTEIN_ mutant . immunoblot analysis showed that the _PROTEIN_ abundance and the amount of the endo h resistant _PROTEIN_ are lower in _PROTEIN_ compared to _PROTEIN_ t _PROTEIN_ . these results suggested that gly is not essential for the biochemical function of _PROTEIN_ but might affect its structure as the _PROTEIN_ abundance is significantly reduced in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . to determine whether _PROTEIN_ is a general _LOCATION_ component rather than a specific component involved only in the _LOCATION_ of _PROTEIN_ we crossed the _PROTEIN_ t mutation into another weak _PROTEIN_ mutant _PROTEIN_ whose br insensitive dwarf phenotype is also caused by _LOCATION_ retention and subsequent _LOCATION_ of the mutant br receptor _PROTEIN_ that carries a cys tyr mutation . as shown in the _PROTEIN_ t mutation significantly increased the _PROTEIN_ abundance and caused accumulation of a detectable amount of _PROTEIN_ carrying the endo h resistant c type n glycan indicative of _LOCATION_ escape . consistently the _PROTEIN_ t mutation suppresses multiple growth defects of the _PROTEIN_ mutant . compared with the _PROTEIN_ mutant the rosette o f _PROTEIN_ t _PROTEIN_ mutant was much larger and its dark grown hypocotyl and mature inflorescent stem are much taller . several recent studies have shown that the correct folding of _PROTEIN_ a _PROTEIN_ like lrr _PROTEIN_ that functions as a cell surface receptor for the bacterial translation elongation _PROTEIN_ ef tu to elicit a plant immunity response requires the _PROTEIN_ mediated _PROTEIN_ folding cycle . loss of function mutations in _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ result in misfolding of _PROTEIN_ and its subsequent _LOCATION_ retention and eventual degradation by an _LOCATION_ process . to investigate whether _PROTEIN_ is also involved in degrading a misfolded _PROTEIN_ we crossed the at t mutation into a t dna insertional _PROTEIN_ mutant _PROTEIN_ and performed an immunoblot experiment using an anti _PROTEIN_ antibody . consistent with several earlier studies no _PROTEIN_ protein was detected in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ but the introduction of the _PROTEIN_ t mutation elevated the _PROTEIN_ protein abundance to the same level as that of the _PROTEIN_ or the _PROTEIN_ t _PROTEIN_ mutant thus supporting a general role of _PROTEIN_ in the arabidopsis _LOCATION_ process . it should be interesting to note that unlike the two mutant br receptors the misfolded _PROTEIN_ protein is not significantly accumulated in the _PROTEIN_ t _PROTEIN_ mutant _PROTEIN_ and thus unlikely saturates its _LOCATION_ retention system to allow a small fraction of _PROTEIN_ protein to escape the _LOCATION_ . consistent with this interpretation the _PROTEIN_ t _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutant remains insensitive to a biologically active epitope derived from the bacterial ef tu as seedlings of both _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ t _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutants grew quite well on medium containing nm that inhibits the growth of the _PROTEIN_ t _PROTEIN_ seedlings . to investigate the role of the mrh domain of _PROTEIN_ in mediating the _LOCATION_ of _PROTEIN_ we generated a _PROTEIN_ transgene driven by the strong and constitutively active promoter mutated the resulting transgene by changing tyr gln and glu into ala glu and asn respectively and transformed the wild type and mutant _PROTEIN_ transgenes individually into the _PROTEIN_ t _PROTEIN_ mutant . all three conserved residues were previously shown to be crucial for the efficient _LOCATION_ of a well studied _LOCATION_ client protein _PROTEIN_ y _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ in yeast . as shown in both gln glu and glu asn mutations destroyed the ability of the _PROTEIN_ transgene to rescue the _PROTEIN_ t mutation which is consistent with a recent structural study showing direct involvement of the two conserved residues in binding an man exposed n glycan . surprisingly the tyr ala mutation had no detectable effect on the _PROTEIN_ function whereas the exact same mutation completely destroyed the biochemical function of in yeast cells . we thus concluded that the mrh domain is crucial for the biochemical function of _PROTEIN_ in the arabidopsis _LOCATION_ mechanism . it is well known that interacts directly with to bring a terminally misfolded glycoprotein onto an _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ anchored ligase with the former recognizing a unique n glycan signal while the latter detects a structural alteration . the arabidopsis genome has two homologous genes but only one _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is functionally involved in the _LOCATION_ of the two mutant br receptors while the other is a non functional pseudogene . to test whether _PROTEIN_ directly interacts with _PROTEIN_ we performed an in vitro pull down assay using e. coli _PROTEIN_ fusion proteins of the luminal domain of _PROTEIN_ tagged at its n terminus with maltose binding protein _PROTEIN_ and the full length _PROTEIN_ tagged at its n terminus with glutathione s transferase _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or just the _PROTEIN_ itself . as shown in mbp _PROTEIN_ immobilized on the amylose resin was able to pull down only the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ fusion protein but not the _PROTEIN_ tag itself suggesting the two _LOCATION_ client recognition _PROTEIN_ are capable of direct physical interaction . our results are consistent with a recent study that demonstrated co immunoprecipitation of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ when the two proteins were transiently _PROTEIN_ in tobacco leaves . a potential _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ biochemical interaction was supported by an immunoblot study that revealed reduced _PROTEIN_ abundance in an _PROTEIN_ mutant but detected normal _PROTEIN_ level in the _PROTEIN_ t mutant . recent studies in yeast showed that joins the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ embedded ligase complex via its physical binding to _PROTEIN_ . we suspected that the stability of _PROTEIN_ is reduced in the absence of the _LOCATION_ anchored linker protein _PROTEIN_ but should not be altered in the absence of the ligase itself . consistent with our prediction a chx decay assay demonstrated that the reduced _PROTEIN_ level in the _PROTEIN_ mutant was indeed caused by increased degradation rather than _PROTEIN_ biosynthesis of _PROTEIN_ but that simultaneous elimination of two arabidopsis homologs had little effect on the stability of _PROTEIN_ . a requirement of _PROTEIN_ for the stability of _PROTEIN_ is consistent with an earlier yeast study showing that is required for the stability of an hdel deleted form of that depends on binding for its _LOCATION_ localization . the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ interaction was further supported by our genetic studies . we reasoned that if _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are physically and mechanistically linked in the same _LOCATION_ pathway simultaneous elimination of both genes should exhibit no additive effect on suppressing the _PROTEIN_ mutation compared to either single mutation . indeed as shown in the _PROTEIN_ t _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ triple mutant is morphologically indistinguishable from the _PROTEIN_ t _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant . consistently overexpression of _PROTEIN_ was not able to suppress the _PROTEIN_ t mutation while overexpression of _PROTEIN_ failed to compensate for the _PROTEIN_ deficiency . these genetic results indicated that the efficient _LOCATION_ of _PROTEIN_ requires both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ .
all arabidopsis mutants and transgenic lines used in this study are in the col ecotype except _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ for genetic analyses and mapping . the t dna insertional mutant _PROTEIN_ t was obtained from the arabidopsis biological resource center at ohio state university and crossed with _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ mutant while the mutant was isolated in a previous genetic screen for suppressors of the _PROTEIN_ mutant . methods for seed sterilization and conditions for plant growth were described previously . the root growth inhibition assay on br containing medium was performed as previously described . the _PROTEIN_ was crossed with a _PROTEIN_ and the resulting plants were self fertilized to generate several mapping populations . genomic dnas from segregating seedlings exhibiting the _PROTEIN_ like morphology was extracted as previously described and used for pcr based molecular mapping using known simple sequence length polymorphism markers . a kb genomic fragment of lacking the predicted stop codon and its untranscribed/untranslated region was amplified from the genomic dna of wild type arabidopsis plants and fused to a dna fragment amplified from a previously described _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ plasmid that contains a synthetic gene for the green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ and the terminator of the pea rbsc gene . they were subsequently cloned into the binary plasmid to create _METHOD_ . the full length cdna of _PROTEIN_ was amplified by reverse transcription pcr and subsequently cloned into the pentr/d topo vector . the resulting pentr plasmid was then mobilized using the gateway lr clonase into a gateway destination vector following the manufacturer s suggested protocol to create a _PROTEIN_ plasmid . similar approaches were used to create and hsos plasmid dnas . site directed mutagenesis with the quikchange xl site directed mutagenesis kit was performed on the _PROTEIN_ plasmid to generate _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutant plasmids . the construction of a genomic transgene and a _PROTEIN_ transgene was previously described . each created plasmid was sequenced to ensure no _LOCATION_ within the pcr amplified dna fragment or at a cloning junction . these plasmids were individually transformed into the agrobacterium strain and the resulting agrobacterial strains were subsequently used to transform the _PROTEIN_ t _PROTEIN_ mutant by the vacuum infiltration method . the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ tagged at its c terminus with the hdel _LOCATION_ retrieval motif and plasmids were co transformed into leaves of week old tobacco plants via an agrobacterium mediated infiltration method . the localization patterns of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and the _LOCATION_ localized _METHOD_ hdel in the co infiltrated tobacco leaves were examined by using a leica confocal laser scanning microscope with an hcx pl apo cs glycerin lens and _PROTEIN_ af software _METHOD_ . the _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ signal was excited by using the or nm laser light respectively . a bp cdna fragment encoding the n terminal amino acids of _PROTEIN_ was cloned into pgex kg and subsequently transformed into competent cells . the _PROTEIN_ fusion protein was induced and purified according to the manufacturer s recommended protocols . the purified _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ protein was sent to pacific immunology for custom antibody production and a resulting antiserum was affinity purified using the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ fusion protein covalently immobilized on the aminolink plus coupling resin by the manufacturer s suggested procedures . two or week old arabidopsis seedlings treated with or without chx bl or tm were grounded in liquid n dissolved in buffer _PROTEIN_ bromophenol blue glycerol and mm mercaptoethanol and boiled for min . after min centrifugation supernatants were used directly for immunoblot analysis or incubated with or without u of endo hf in buffer for h at and the treated proteins were separated by or _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and analyzed by _METHOD_ blue staining or by immunoblot with antibody raised against _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ . the entire open reading frame of _PROTEIN_ was obtained by rt pcr amplification from total rnas isolated from wild type arabidopsis plants and cloned into the bacterial _PROTEIN_ vector pgex kg . the induction and purification of the _PROTEIN_ tagged full length _PROTEIN_ protein were carried out as described above for a truncated _PROTEIN_ fusion protein used for raising the anti _PROTEIN_ antibody while the induction and purification of an mbp _PROTEIN_ fusion protein were performed as previously described . to perform the pull down assay purified soluble _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ protein were incubated with equal amounts of mbp _PROTEIN_ still bound to the amylose resin for h at . after washing for four times in _PROTEIN_ containing triton x the proteins still remained on the resin were dissolved in sample buffer separated by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and analyzed by immunoblot using an anti _PROTEIN_ antiserum .
