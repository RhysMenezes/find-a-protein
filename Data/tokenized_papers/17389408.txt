morlin was discovered in a screen of compounds for small molecules that cause altered cell morphology resulting in swollen root phenotype in arabidopsis . live cell imaging of _METHOD_ labeled cellulose synthase _PROTEIN_ and microtubules showed that morlin acts on the cortical microtubules and alters the movement of _PROTEIN_ . morlin caused a novel syndrome of cytoskeletal defects characterized by cortical array reorientation and compromised rates of both microtubule elongation and shrinking . formation of shorter and more bundled microtubules and detachment from the cell _LOCATION_ resulted when _METHOD_ mbp was used to visualize microtubules during morlin treatment . cytoskeletal effects were accompanied by a reduction in the velocity and redistribution of _PROTEIN_ complexes labeled with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ at the cell cortex . morlin caused no inhibition of mouse myoblast bacterial or fungal cell proliferation at concentrations that inhibit plant cell growth . by contrast morlin stimulated microtubule disassembly in cultured hippocampal neurons but had no significant effect on cell viability . thus morlin appears to be a useful new probe of the _METHOD_ that regulate microtubule cortical array organization and its functional interaction with _PROTEIN_ .
inhibition of cellulose synthesis by mutations or inhibitors such as isoxaben results in _PROTEIN_ anisotropy of cell expansion . additionally depending on the severity of inhibition cells may expand manyfold in diameter relative to controls resulting in swollen organs . based on these phenotypes two chemically diverse small molecule libraries were visually screened for compounds that caused organ swelling . arabidopsis seedlings were germinated in solutions of each compound in well plates . from a total of compounds screened compounds that caused root or hypocotyl swelling were selected for further analysis . compound cbi was selected for detailed investigation . germination on cbi caused severe cell and tissue swelling of the hypocotyl and upper root in both arabidopsis and switchgrass seedlings consistent with the effects expected from weakening of cell walls . to identify the most active analogs of morlin we conducted a structure based search using webtools available through chemmine for commercially available analogs . of the analogs screened the most potent inhibitors of plant root growth were ethoxy ethyl chromen one ethoxy methyl chromen one dehydrochromen one and chromen one all of which caused inhibition of root growth to < of the control at . several coumarins were found to cause either only a partial root swelling phenotype or no inhibition of seedling root growth . based on this analysis we selected ethoxy methyl chromen one for further analysis because it was commercially available in large quantities and highly active in root growth inhibition . we named the compound morlin because as noted _PROTEIN_ it caused a cellular phenotype reminiscent of the _PROTEIN_ mutation of arabidopsis . the approximate concentration at which morlin inhibited root growth by was in both switchgrass and arabidopsis . morlin caused dose dependent inhibition of cellulose synthesis with significant inhibition of cellulose deposition observed at . in addition to radial swelling in roots and hypocotyls at sublethal concentrations morlin stimulated a right handed helical root phenotype on plants grown on vertically oriented agar medium . to quantify inhibition of cellulose synthesis incorporation of _PROTEIN_ into the cellulose fraction of seedling cell walls was measured after a h incubation period in the label . seedlings that were preincubated for h in morlin exhibited a _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ incorporation compared with a _METHOD_ control . although morlin caused a marked _PROTEIN_ in cellulose production after h exposure to a increase in callose biosynthesis was observed demonstrating that the udp _PROTEIN_ pool was not depleted . loss of cell growth anisotropy and reduced cellulose content might be caused by either direct inhibition of cellulose biosynthesis or a failure to deliver and regulate _PROTEIN_ appropriately . to investigate these alternatives we visualized both microtubules and _PROTEIN_ in living cells . in hypocotyl cells of dark grown seedlings _PROTEIN_ microtubule markers _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ or _METHOD_ morlin caused marked changes in cytoskeletal organization . as visualized with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ the number of cells showing clear transverse oriented cortical arrays dropped significantly in comparison with mock treated controls from to . the remaining cells in both treatments had either longitudinal or disordered arrays . _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ labeled arrays in morlin treated cells also appeared more sparse with labeled microtubules occupying less area in confocal images . the effect of morlin on cortical array organization was distinct from that of oryzalin even at morlin the array was noticeably more intact than was the case after treatment with oryzalin a drug that binds tubulin dimers and interferes with dimer addition to polymer ends . _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ data were consistent with tubulin _METHOD_ studies in which intact microtubules were no longer detected in morlin treated cells and anti tubulin labeling was primarily distributed in punctate beads at the cell cortex . measurement of microtubule polymerization dynamics showed that morlin caused a significant _PROTEIN_ in both elongation and shrinkage rates at the plus end and in shrinkage rate at the minus end as compared with control cells . the relative reduction in mean elongation rate was nearly twice that of the relative reduction in shrinking rate consistent with the observation of less microtubule area in the presence of the drug . a change in the proportion of time spent either in elongation or shrinking does not explain loss of polymer after drug treatment because morlin treatment actually appeared to increase slightly the amount of time spent in growth and reduce modestly the amount of time spent shrinking . transition frequencies were not calculated because of the limited amount of time that the ends of any single treadmilling microtubule could be observed in the relatively dense cortical arrays of epidermal cells in etiolated tissue . consistent with measurement of reduced elongation and shrinkage velocities the dynamicity was significantly lower in morlin treated cells . as was reported previously a small net gain of polymer was observed in each treatment suggesting that either these arrays were not at a steady state at the time of observation or there was a sampling bias in the observed microtubule ends . taken together measurements of polymerization dynamics suggest that a primary effect of morlin on the microtubule _LOCATION_ is to reduce polymer dynamicity by inhibiting the rates of both dimer addition and loss at polymer ends . in vivo measurements of single microtubule growth phases dynamicity and net polymer gain/loss in no drug versus morlin treated cells in addition to experiments with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ we also visualized microtubules by _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ . as with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ reduction in the rates of microtubule elongation and shrinking were readily observed in morlin treated cells by time lapse imaging . however additional changes in microtubule organization were also evident . microtubules became arranged into short segments of similar lengths . the high degree of labeling indicated that these segments were polymer bundles and analysis of intensity distribution among these segments suggested that the frequency and degree of polymer bundling increased after morlin treatment . these bundles often lost positional stability and showed translocation behaviors that suggested detachment from the cell _LOCATION_ . in many cases pivoting movements of bundles about one end were observed suggesting that bundles often remained attached to the cell _LOCATION_ at one end . some bundles showed complete detachment from the cortex resulting in a microtubule moving in the underlying cytoplasmic stream . the origin of of these short and mobile microtubule bundles was traced in time lapse movies acquired during morlin application . observation of new bundle creation during the period from the onset of morlin effects showed that short labeled bundles did not arise by severing or depolymerizing existing bundles . rather these structures appeared to arise de novo initially being composed of short and dynamic polymers that stabilized at a fixed length after several minutes . stabilization of microtubule turnover was supported by florescence recovery after photobleaching analysis in which _METHOD_ microtubules showed recovery values of min whereas after treatment with morlin was > min . both polymer bundling and _LOCATION_ detachment were reversed by drug washout . the inhibition of cellulose synthesis by morlin did not follow a classical inhibition curve but a clear _PROTEIN_ in the cellulose content and incorporation into cellulose was measured . to explore further how morlin inhibits cellulose synthesis we took advantage of a functional live cell tag for the cellulose biosynthetic complex _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ to ask whether morlin affects localization or dynamic behavior of the complex . consistent with a reduction in cellulose content time lapse confocal imaging of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ mm below the apical hook of to d old etiolated seedlings showed that morlin treatment reduced the velocity of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ complexes in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . in addition to a reduction in _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ complex velocity the distribution of label was altered by morlin . although labeled particles remained organized into obliquely linear arrays at the cell cortex particles were fewer in number and often higher in label intensity . to determine whether the effects of morlin on _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ distribution and behavior depended on the microtubule _LOCATION_ we pretreated seedlings with oryzalin before morlin application to deplete the cell cortex of microtubules . after h incubation in oryzalin depolymerization of all detectable cortical microtubules was achieved and as reported a more uniform dispersion of _PROTEIN_ particles was observed with individual particles tracking in linear and oblique trajectories across the cell cortex . we measured the rate of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ translocation and found that oryzalin had no measurable effect on _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ complex velocity yet when cells were treated further with morlin for h the velocities of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ complexes were significantly reduced to values similar to those measured after treatment with morlin alone . this experiment was repeated by using shorter oryzalin exposure times with similar results . therefore it appears that inhibition of _PROTEIN_ complex velocity by morlin does not depend on the interaction of _PROTEIN_ with an intact microtubule _LOCATION_ . by contrast the effect of morlin on the distribution of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ label depended highly on the presence of detectible microtubules . whereas morlin treatment on its own caused the redistribution of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ into fewer and brighter particles as described above this morlin dependent redistribution was not observed when microtubules were depolymerized by oryzalin . instead _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ distribution appeared much as it did with oryzalin treatment alone . to test for other effects of morlin treatment a variety of _METHOD_ protein markers were assayed for alterations in organelle morphology or protein distribution . markers highlighting the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ actin filaments _LOCATION_ apparatus the _LOCATION_ and the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ did not show any pronounced changes in response to drug treatment that could not be reasonably accounted for by changes in microtubule organization . proliferation of e. coli in liquid culture was not inhibited by addition of or morlin . similarly addition of morlin did not inhibit growth of the yeast p. pastoris . mouse myoblast _PROTEIN_ cells treated with morlin for h and then stained for tubulin also showed no changes in microtubule organization . immunolabeling of tubulin in neuronal processes showed that morlin caused severe microtubule disarray in high density hippocampal neuronal cultures characterized by an increase in free tubulin microtubule disassembly and neuritic beading . microtubule disarray caused by morlin depended on the time of exposure to the drug and the neuronal stage of development because neurons exhibited a smaller degree of susceptibility to the drug compared with neurons . morlin further caused disruption of vesicular transport as observed by the accumulation of the vesicular glutamate transporter a synaptic marker for excitatory glutamatergic neurons . despite the disruption of cytoskeletal structure the same concentration of the drug had no significant effect on cell viability as determined morphologically by analysis of _LOCATION_ condensation and by mtt reduction assay .
