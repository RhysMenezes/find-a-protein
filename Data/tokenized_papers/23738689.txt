_LOCATION_ sorting receptors are type i integral _LOCATION_ family proteins that in plant cells are thought to recognize cargo proteins at the _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ or trans _LOCATION_ network for _LOCATION_ transport via the pre _LOCATION_ compartment . however little is known about vsr cargo proteins in plants . here we developed and tested an in vivo _PROTEIN_ system for the identification of vsr cargos which is based on the premise that the _PROTEIN_ n terminus of vsrs will be secreted into the culture medium along with their corresponding cargo proteins . indeed transgenic arabidopsis culture cell lines _PROTEIN_ vsr n terminal binding domains were shown to secrete truncated vsrs _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ with attached cargo molecules into the culture medium . putative cargo proteins were identified through _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . several identified cargo proteins were confirmed by localization studies and interaction analysis with vsrs . the screening strategy described here should be applicable to all vsrs and will help identify and study cargo proteins for individual vsr proteins . this method should be useful for both cargo identification and protein protein interaction in vivo .
since the vsr n terminus is responsible for cargo binding while its tmd/ct is responsible for targeting we have hypothesized that over _PROTEIN_ of truncated vsr in transgenic plant cells would result in secretion of vsrnt proteins together with their specific cargo proteins into the culture medium . to test this hypothesis we first systematically compared the effects of increasing concentrations of _PROTEIN_ on trafficking of aleurain _METHOD_ to the _LOCATION_ in a transient _PROTEIN_ system . in arabidopsis protoplasts aleurain _METHOD_ trafficked to the central _LOCATION_ forming two protein species at and kda when detected with a _METHOD_ antibody . the kda species corresponds to the intact protein and the kda species is the processed form in the central _LOCATION_ termed the _METHOD_ core . thus the amount of the kda species can be used to measure _LOCATION_ trafficking efficiency . the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ protoplasts served as a positive control . we then examined the dose dependence of cargo secretion using constant amounts of aleurain _METHOD_ and increasing amounts of _PROTEIN_ dna . in this secretion assay the protoplasts were split into equal portions for transfection and equal amounts of extracted proteins were detected by western blotting using the cis _LOCATION_ marker mani . _PROTEIN_ protein _PROTEIN_ increased with increasing amounts of _PROTEIN_ dna as indicated using antibody in the protoplast fraction . the amount of the kda processed form in the protoplasts gradually _PROTEIN_ with increasing amounts of _PROTEIN_ and concomitantly the amount of aleurain _METHOD_ secreted into the medium was increased . interestingly aleurain _METHOD_ was partially proteolytically processed to a kda form in the medium which may be attributable to the presence of _LOCATION_ proteases . the increase of vsrnt protein in the medium was detected by a vsr antibody which further confirmed that the secretion of aleurain _METHOD_ was because of the secretion of _PROTEIN_ . the cytoplasmic marker tubulin was not detected using anti tub in the medium even when the film was exposed for a long time which excludes the possibility that the presence of _PROTEIN_ and aleurain _METHOD_ in the medium was due to leakage from damaged protoplasts . taken together these data demonstrate that the cargo proteins can be co secreted together with vsrnt . as a next step we generated a stable arabidopsis cell culture line _PROTEIN_ three truncated vsr proteins _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and having a tag at their c terminus . the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and also accumulated in the culture medium of the transgenic psb d cells but not in wild type cells . in _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis wt cells anti vsr antibodies only detected the endogenous vsr proteins in the intracellular fraction that were missing from the secreted medium fraction . in contrast in transgenic arabidopsis psb d cells _PROTEIN_ the truncated _PROTEIN_ a protein band corresponding to the truncated _PROTEIN_ in addition to the presence of the endogenous vsr proteins was detected in the intracellular fraction . the secreted form of _PROTEIN_ but not the endogenous vsr was detected in the secreted medium fraction . similar results were also obtained from transgenic psb d cells _PROTEIN_ the truncated _PROTEIN_ or . the antibody further proved the detection in which only the truncated form of vsrnt was detected . western blotting analysis on intracellular and secreted proteins of both wt and transgenic vsrnt psb d cells further indicated that there is no leakage of the cellular components into the secreted fraction and the method of collecting the secreted medium fraction faithfully reflects the integrity of the culture cells without any cell contamination . furthermore the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis psb d culture cells are functional proteins that are able to interact specifically against the synthetic vsd peptides but not their mutant _METHOD_ . therefore based on the hypothesis that cargo proteins of individual vsrs will be co secreted together along with the vsrnt into the medium allows for their detection and identification by _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . in the wt cell culture medium a total of proteins were identified via nano liquid chromatography tandem _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and fourier transform _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ analysis . these proteins are mostly cell wall related proteins such as glycoside hydrolyses esterases lyases expansins lectin domain containing proteins leucine rich repeat domain containing proteins and enzyme inhibitors . in the transgenic cell line medium we could identify the corresponding vsrnt protein _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in all samples . in addition we identified putative cargo proteins that were uniquely found in the medium of transgenic psb d cell lines including three _LOCATION_ proteases five glycosyl hydrolases three oxireductases two chitinases a redox enzyme glutaredoxin _PROTEIN_ a curculin like lectin family protein a cysteine protease inhibitor family protein and an unknown protein . out of the identified proteins none of them had been previously described as a vsr interacting protein and only four of them were previously reported as _LOCATION_ proteins . among the identified potential cargo proteins each of the truncated vsr proteins _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ secreted different kinds of proteins and yet shared common cargo proteins . mw molecular weight in da pi isoelectric point . y indicates the presence of this protein in the medium of transgenic psb d cell lines . the total score and peptide number of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ are in parentheses with fourier transform _METHOD_ _METHOD_ results underlined . the vsr sorted cargo proteins are believed to traffic through pvcs prior to reaching _LOCATION_ in plant cells . therefore pvc localization of the cargo can be confirmed by co localization with vsr marker proteins . four putative cargo proteins including cysteine proteinase glycosyl hydrolase family protein _PROTEIN_ and cpi that were well _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis psb d protoplasts were further analyzed in the following experiments . as a positive control aleurain _METHOD_ showed both a punctate pattern co localizing with the pvc marker _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and a diffuse pattern in the _LOCATION_ . similarly cp _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ gave rise to punctate _METHOD_ within the cytoplasm which co localized with the pvc marker _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and a diffuse pattern in the _LOCATION_ after a h incubation . _METHOD_ and cpi _METHOD_ showed a slight _LOCATION_ pattern and co localized with the pvc marker _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ as punctate pvc signals after a h incubation . finally _METHOD_ and cpi _METHOD_ also showed a diffuse _METHOD_ pattern in the _LOCATION_ after incubation for and h indicating their accumulation in the _LOCATION_ . these cargo proteins partially co localized with the cis _LOCATION_ mani _METHOD_ marker or the tgn marker _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ probably owing to saturation of the sorting system in the cis _LOCATION_ or tgn thus delaying the transport of these over _PROTEIN_ cargoes through these organelles . to confirm the trafficking of these putative cargo proteins we also used _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ as a tool to study the cargo proteins . in arabidopsis psb d protoplasts when _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was co _PROTEIN_ with aleurain _METHOD_ the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ labelled structures co localized with the aleurain _METHOD_ positive pvcs . _PROTEIN_ which promotes the _PROTEIN_ bound state was also used because its _PROTEIN_ induces pvc enlargement derived from homotypic pvc fusion . when _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was co _PROTEIN_ with aleurain _METHOD_ the bright punctate aleurain containing pvcs assumed a _PROTEIN_ like structure and the soluble marker aleurain _METHOD_ accumulated in the pvc lumen . therefore the pvc localized cargo proteins should have the same characteristics when co _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ . indeed when the putative cargo proteins cp _METHOD_ _METHOD_ cpi _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were co _PROTEIN_ together with the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis psb d protoplasts the signals for the soluble _METHOD_ form were found _PROTEIN_ inside the vacuolated pvcs with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ signals being found on their limiting _LOCATION_ . these results confirm that _METHOD_ tagged putative cargo proteins are targeted to the lytic _LOCATION_ via the pvcs . if the _METHOD_ tagged cargo proteins were to transport into the _LOCATION_ the full length precursor proteins would be cleaved into their mature form and a _METHOD_ core . to test this possibility and find out the nature of the protein of these identified cargos arabidopsis psb d protoplasts were transformed with individual cargo proteins _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ followed by isolation of soluble proteins from intracellular fraction and subsequent western blot analysis using anti _METHOD_ antibodies . indeed as shown in figure in all tested samples a large amount of the kda processed _METHOD_ core was detected probably owing to processing of the cargo proteins from the precursor form into the mature form during _LOCATION_ trafficking . these results point to the _LOCATION_ trafficking of these cargo proteins . to explore the interaction specificity between identified cargo proteins and vsrs in vitro co immunoprecipitation studies were further carried out . the tagged versions of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and were transiently _PROTEIN_ together with _METHOD_ tagged cargo proteins in protoplasts from psb d suspension cells . subsequently protein extracts from transformed protoplasts were subjected to immunoprecipitation using the _METHOD_ trap which is based on recombinant single domain antibody fragments coupled to agarose beads . _METHOD_ was used as a negative control for the co immunoprecipitation . the immunoprecipitates were analyzed by western blotting using anti _METHOD_ or anti antibodies . as shown in figure _METHOD_ did not interact with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or because there was no protein band detected in the immunoprecipitates using antibodies whereas aleurain _METHOD_ was found to interact with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and . in addition _PROTEIN_ was detected in the immune complexes when co transformed with cp _METHOD_ or cpi _METHOD_ individually but with low signal intensity with _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . these results indicate that _PROTEIN_ may interact with nearly all identified cargo proteins although with different binding affinities . in contrast _PROTEIN_ was not detected in the immunoprecipitates when co _PROTEIN_ with _METHOD_ or cpi _METHOD_ indicating no interaction between _PROTEIN_ and these two cargoes . further quantification of the corresponding signal intensities indicated that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ has a high binding affinity with _PROTEIN_ reaching binding affinity compared with that of cp _METHOD_ . moreover showed relatively low intensity in immunoprecipitates in protoplasts transformed with _METHOD_ or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ with and binding affinity respectively . taken together these data point to specific interaction between various cargo proteins and different vsrs.z proteins destined for _LOCATION_ usually contain vsds that are recognized by vsrs . basically three different types of vsds have been studied sequence specific vsds non sequence specific c terminal vsds and large internal stretches of polypeptide in certain storage proteins for psv sorting . the vsds of the putative cargo proteins were further investigated by software analysis and _LOCATION_ targeting analysis . the putative vsds in these identified cargoes were analyzed using meme and are shown in table . one protein contains a npir motif and other proteins have npir variants following the predicted signal peptide cleavage site in the middle or at the c terminus . in addition several other proteins including subtilase chitinase and two glycosyl hydrolase family proteins were identified to contain a highly hydrophobic c terminal extension probably representing ctvsd for _LOCATION_ transport in arabidopsis . however two proteins _PROTEIN_ contain no known vsds . the putative vsds are underlined . ssvsd sequence specific vsd ctvsd non sequence specific c terminal vsd . we next performed a localization study to confirm the predicted vsds of cp cpi and using _METHOD_ fusions with predicted vsds and alanine mutants in arabidopsis psb d protoplasts . upon transient co _PROTEIN_ cp vsd _METHOD_ cpi vsd _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ vsd co localized with the pvc marker _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and transported into the _LOCATION_ after incubation for or h. the punctate dots of cp vsd _METHOD_ cpi vsd _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ vsd were partially co localized with the cis _LOCATION_ marker mani _METHOD_ or the tgn marker _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . however when their vsds were subjected to alanine mutation all the resulting mutant fusions cp vsdm _METHOD_ cpi vsdm _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ vsdm were found to be separated from the pvc marker _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and did not reach the _LOCATION_ even after incubation for h . in contract the punctate dots of cp vsdm _METHOD_ and cpi vsdm _METHOD_ were co localized with the cis _LOCATION_ marker mani _METHOD_ but separated from the tgn marker _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . no co localization was observed between _METHOD_ vsdm and the cis _LOCATION_ marker mani _METHOD_ or tgn marker _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ does not contain classically known ssvsd and ctvsd . to study its putative vsd containing region we fused its first amino acids containing signal peptide with _METHOD_ . the resulting _PROTEIN_ vsd _METHOD_ showed both punctate dots and _LOCATION_ patterns whereas the punctate dots of _PROTEIN_ vsd _METHOD_ were found to be co localized with the pvc marker _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ but separated from the cis _LOCATION_ marker mani _METHOD_ and occasionally co localized with tgn marker _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . these results indicated that the first amino acids of _PROTEIN_ contain sufficient information for its pvc _LOCATION_ targeting . indeed when its hydrophobic amino acid sequence vkkti was substituted by alanine the resulting _PROTEIN_ vsdm _METHOD_ fusion was found to be retained in the _LOCATION_ when co _PROTEIN_ with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ mani _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . thus we have defined the vkkti sequence as being a vsd for _PROTEIN_ . cargo proteins are sorted into _LOCATION_ because their vsds are recognized by vsrs . however when a vsd is mutated the cargo will be secreted into the culture medium . we thus next test if vsd mutation on the identified cargos will result in their secretion upon their _PROTEIN_ . arabidopsis protoplasts were first transformed with various _METHOD_ fusions with cargo vsds or their alanine mutants followed by protein isolation from intracellular and _LOCATION_ medium for subsequent western blot analysis using anti _METHOD_ antibodies . as shown in figure h after transformation cp vsd _METHOD_ _METHOD_ vsd cpi vsd _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ vsd _METHOD_ were detected as two protein bands of and kda in the intracellular fraction with no detectable signal in the _LOCATION_ medium . the kda band corresponds to the intact _METHOD_ fusion protein whereas the kda band is the processed _METHOD_ core form in the central _LOCATION_ . in contrast identical experiments using their vsd alanine mutants _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ resulted in the detection of the kda protein band in the _LOCATION_ medium together with little _METHOD_ core signal . the amount of secreted protein was highest for _PROTEIN_ vsdm _METHOD_ and lowest for _METHOD_ vsdm . taken together these results indicate that vsd alanine mutants caused secretion of these cargo proteins .
