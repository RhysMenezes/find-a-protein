pollen represents an important nitrogen sink in flowers to ensure pollen viability . since pollen cells are symplasmically isolated during maturation and germination _LOCATION_ transporters are required for nitrogen import across the pollen _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . this study describes the characterization of the ammonium transporter _PROTEIN_ a so far uncharacterized member of the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ family which is suggested to be involved in transporting ammonium into pollen . the _PROTEIN_ gene encodes a functional ammonium transporter when heterologously _PROTEIN_ in yeast or when overexpressed in arabidopsis roots . concentration dependent analysis of labeled ammonium influx into roots of _PROTEIN_ transformed plants allowed characterization of _PROTEIN_ as a high affinity transporter with a km of . rna and protein gel blot analysis showed _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in flowers and promoter gene fusions to the green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ further defined its exclusive _PROTEIN_ in pollen grains and pollen tubes . the _PROTEIN_ protein appeared to be localized to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ as indicated by protein gel blot analysis of _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ enriched _LOCATION_ fractions and by visualization of _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ protein in pollen grains and pollen tubes . however no phenotype related to pollen function could be observed in a transposon tagged line in which _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is disrupted . these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ mediates ammonium uptake across the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ of pollen to contribute to nitrogen nutrition of pollen via ammonium uptake or retrieval .
out of the six amt proteins identified in arabidopsis five have been subjected to functional analysis to date . for a functional characterization of _PROTEIN_ the corresponding gene was amplified by pcr from genomic dna of the arabidopsis ecotype col which was possible due to the absence of introns . the open reading frame in _PROTEIN_ is bp long and encodes a protein of amino acids with a calculated molecular _METHOD_ of kda . at the amino acid level _PROTEIN_ shares a high degree of homology to other members of the _PROTEIN_ family in arabidopsis . to investigate the functional properties of the _PROTEIN_ protein the orf of _PROTEIN_ was cloned into the yeast _PROTEIN_ vector and placed under control of the constitutively active yeast hexose transporter promoter . the resulting construct was used for transformation of the yeast stain which is defective in the _PROTEIN_ of three endogenous ammonium transporter genes _PROTEIN_ . this strain grows poorly on low ammonium concentrations as a sole nitrogen source . in contrast to transformants carrying the empty vector yeast cells _PROTEIN_ either _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ were able to grow on mm ammonium indicating that _PROTEIN_ similarly to _PROTEIN_ encodes a functional ammonium transporter .fig . complementation of the ammonium uptake defective yeast strain by _PROTEIN_ . the triple mep yeast mutant was transformed with the empty vector _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ . transformants were pre cultured for h on ynb medium supplemented with mm arginine . a ml aliquot of a saturated culture was harvested and resuspended in ml of water . one to fold dilutions of a l aliquot of yeast cell suspension were spotted on ynb medium supplemented with either mm arginine or mm at ph . growth complementation of the ammonium uptake defective yeast strain by _PROTEIN_ . the triple mep yeast mutant was transformed with the empty vector _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ . transformants were pre cultured for h on ynb medium supplemented with mm arginine . a ml aliquot of a saturated culture was harvested and resuspended in ml of water . one to fold dilutions of a l aliquot of yeast cell suspension were spotted on ynb medium supplemented with either mm arginine or mm at ph . _PROTEIN_ was then constitutively _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis plants to examine whether _PROTEIN_ has the potential to contribute to ammonium uptake in roots . to circumvent transport activities from endogenous atamts in arabidopsis roots a multiple insertion line was chosen for transformation in which the high affinity ammonium uptake capacity is reduced by approximately due to the genetic disruption of the _PROTEIN_ and genes . four independent homozygous lines from the generation of _PROTEIN_ transformants were selected for further investigation . rna gel blot analysis of root rna from week old plants grown in nitrogen sufficient nutrient solution showed that _PROTEIN_ transcripts were highly _PROTEIN_ in roots of the transgenic lines and . no hybridization signal was detected in qko confirming that _PROTEIN_ is not or at least very weakly _PROTEIN_ in roots under these conditions . furthermore large amounts of _PROTEIN_ protein were found in the same transgenic lines by protein gel blot analysis of microsomal _LOCATION_ fractions from roots using a rabbit antibody directed against amino acid residues in the c terminus of _PROTEIN_ . also no protein signal was detected in qko . two _PROTEIN_ specific bands were observed with an apparent molecular _METHOD_ of approximately and kda . although the predicted molecular weight of the _PROTEIN_ protein is approximately kda the kda band is supposed to correspond to the monomer since lipophilic _LOCATION_ proteins usually migrate at a lower apparent molecular _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . the kda band probably represents the dimer of _PROTEIN_ or a stable complex with another unknown protein . fig . of _PROTEIN_ in a multiple insertion line defective in high affinity ammonium uptake . rna gel blot analysis of root rna from a quadruple knock out line and qko _PROTEIN_ transgenic plants using the orf of _PROTEIN_ as

shoots of qko _PROTEIN_ transgenic plants were separated by aqueous two phase partitioning into a _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ enriched upper phase and an endosomal _LOCATION_ enriched lower phase . protein gel blot analysis was conducted with antibodies against _PROTEIN_ an arabidopsis _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ h _PROTEIN_ a v _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and a vppase . to examine the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ in these transgenic lines shoot microsomal _LOCATION_ fractions of the line were separated by two phase partitioning into a _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ enriched upper phase and a lower phase enriched in endosomal _LOCATION_ including _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ chloroplast and tonoplast _LOCATION_ . the purity of these _LOCATION_ fractions was verified by the abundance of the _PROTEIN_ protein a subunit of the _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and alternatively by the abundance of the _LOCATION_ pyrophosphatase which both were enriched in the lower phase . in contrast _PROTEIN_ protein accumulated in the upper phase coinciding with high _PROTEIN_ levels of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ h _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . this observation strongly indicated a localization of the _PROTEIN_ protein in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . to test the functionality of overexpressed _PROTEIN_ protein in roots qko and three transgenic lines were grown on agar medium supplemented with either ammonium or nitrate as the sole nitrogen source . at ammonium qko plants grew poorly because of a low ammonium uptake capacity in roots while the transgenic lines were able to increase shoot _METHOD_ significantly indicating that _PROTEIN_ is able to mediate ammonium uptake into plant roots . in contrast plant growth did not differ between qko and transgenic plants with the supply of m nitrate . besides ammonium plant _PROTEIN_ type transporters have also been shown to permeate the substrate analog methylammonium which is toxic to plants _PROTEIN_ . when grown on mm nitrate in the presence of mm mea the transgenic lines showed a much higher sensitivity to mea than qko plants supporting that _PROTEIN_ is also able to transport mea . fig . of qko _PROTEIN_ transgenic lines on ammonium and its toxic analog methylammonium . growth of qko plants and transgenic qko _PROTEIN_ plants on agar containing m or m for d after pre culture on half strength _METHOD_ medium for d. shoot dry weights

nitrate and sucrose for d after pre culture on half strength _METHOD_ medium for d. shoot dry weights of the same plants as in . bars indicate means sd and significant differences at p < within each group are indicated by different letters . to evaluate the ammonium uptake capacity in roots a short term influx study was conducted using labeled ammonium and was subsequently determined by stable isotope _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . six week old plants grown hydroponically under nitrogen sufficient conditions were subjected to influx analysis at m labeled ammonium as a measure for high affinity uptake . all four lines showed an almost fold higher ammonium uptake capacity compared with qko . in contrast no significant difference was observed when the influx analyses were conducted at mm labeled ammonium supply . low affinity ammonium uptake capacity as calculated by subtraction of the influx value at m from that at mm did not differ among the lines . therefore these results indicate that overexpression of _PROTEIN_ in qko roots increases the capacity for high affinity but not for low affinity ammonium uptake . to investigate the biochemical properties of _PROTEIN_ in more detail a concentration dependent influx analysis was performed with qko and the transgenic line . ammonium influx in qko roots followed almost a linear concentration dependency indicative of a lack of high affinity uptake as described in yuan et al . . however ammonium influx in roots saturated above approximately m. net ammonium influx mediated by the _PROTEIN_ protein was then determined by subtraction of values of qko from those of allowing calculation of a km value of approximately m . fig . high affinity ammonium uptake capacity in qko _PROTEIN_ transgenic plants . influx of labeled

or from leaves _METHOD_ flowers and siliques of mature plants grown in soil . the orfs of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were used as probes . while _PROTEIN_ showed a ubiquitous _PROTEIN_ pattern with relatively weak _PROTEIN_ in flowers _PROTEIN_ was detected exclusively in flowers . furthermore using the _PROTEIN_ specific antibody _PROTEIN_ protein was also exclusively detected in the microsomal _LOCATION_ fractions of flower tissue . there the _PROTEIN_ protein appeared at a molecular _METHOD_ of approximately kda . in contrast to the overexpressed _PROTEIN_ protein in transgenic roots and shoots of qko the putative monomer at kda was not observed in flowers . fig . of _PROTEIN_ is restricted to pollen . rna gel blot analysis of rna from various arabidopsis tissues using the orfs of

genomic dna fragment corresponding to bp of the upstream region of _PROTEIN_ including the start codon and the orf of _PROTEIN_ was fused to the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ reporter gene and used for transformation of arabidopsis wild type plants . thus in these transgenic lines the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein was _PROTEIN_ under control of its native promoter . within all of six independent homozygous transgenic lines _METHOD_ dependent _METHOD_ of the fusion protein was detected exclusively in pollen . according to smyth et al . green _METHOD_ in pollen was initiated at flower stage and became more intense with pollen maturity during floral development . _PROTEIN_ promoter activity also appeared to be high during pollen germination on the stigmata of flowers . to determine the subcellular localization of the _PROTEIN_ protein in pollen transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ promoter orf _METHOD_ construct were investigated in parallel using the same promoter sequence as for generation of the _PROTEIN_ promoter _METHOD_ lines . mature pollen from transgenic plants was germinated in vitro on solid agar medium . by _METHOD_ imaging _PROTEIN_ dependent green _METHOD_ appeared as a thin layer along the border of pollen grains and pollen tubes although some _METHOD_ was also observed in internal cell compartments . in the transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ promoter _METHOD_ construct _METHOD_ derived _METHOD_ was also found to be _PROTEIN_ only in pollen grains and pollen tubes which further confirmed the pollen specific promoter activity of _PROTEIN_ . in contrast to the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein soluble _METHOD_ produced _METHOD_ throughout the whole body of the pollen grain or pollen tube . these observations indicated that the _PROTEIN_ protein localizes to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ of pollen grains and pollen tubes . fig . localizes to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ of pollen grains and pollen tubes . _METHOD_ microscopy of a mature

of _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis pollen six independent insertion lines for the _PROTEIN_ gene were identified by screening of publicly available libraries and homozygous plants were generated and selected by pcr analysis . the t dna insertion sites were verified by sequencing to be upstream of the start codon of the _PROTEIN_ gene in five independent lines named _PROTEIN_ to _PROTEIN_ . however rna gel blot analysis revealed that _PROTEIN_ gene _PROTEIN_ was neither absent nor repressed . when compared with their corresponding wild type col _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was even higher in the lines _PROTEIN_ and probably resulting from the presence of an additional promoter activity within the t dna insertion or from the ectopic _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in other parts of flowers due to the disruption of pollen specific elements in the _PROTEIN_ promoter region . with _PROTEIN_ to the considerable level of _PROTEIN_ mrna that could still be detected only _PROTEIN_ appeared to represent a knock down line . however in the line _PROTEIN_ a transposon insertion was identified to be located within the orf of _PROTEIN_ bp downstream of the start codon . as a consequence _PROTEIN_ transcript abundance was absent as revealed by rna gel blot analysis of flower rna and in addition no more _PROTEIN_ protein was detected in microsomal _LOCATION_ fractions of flower tissue . subsequently three independent transgenic lines were generated in which _PROTEIN_ gene _PROTEIN_ was conferred to _PROTEIN_ plants under control of its native promoter . the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in these lines was evaluated at the transcript and protein levels as shown in b and c. fig . of the transposon tagged line _PROTEIN_ . the position of the transposon insertion in the orf of _PROTEIN_ located bp

corresponding wild type and the complemented transgenic lines . however when grown in nutrient solution or in soil substrate no phenotypic difference appeared . the mutant plants were fertile and produced normal seeds . moreover no significant difference was observed with _PROTEIN_ to pollen development pollen size or pollen abundance . in in vitro pollen germination assays germination rates did not differ between mutant and wild type pollen . since the _PROTEIN_ protein is able to transport mea in vitro pollen germination in the presence of mea was analyzed . pollen germination was strongly inhibited by increasing concentrations of mea in the medium indicating the acquisition of toxic mea by pollen during the germination process . however no significant difference in the pollen germination rate was observed between mutant and wild type plants .

this fragment was introduced into the plasmid _PROTEIN_ promoter orf ptkan using the psti restriction site and yielding the plasmid _PROTEIN_ promoter orf _METHOD_ . arabidopsis col transformed with both of these constructs by agrobacterium were selected via kanamycin resistance and homozygous lines were further selected by segregation analysis . the _METHOD_ of _METHOD_ in the transgenic plants was observed by an inverted _METHOD_ microscope equipped with an apotome and by a confocal laser scanning microscope as described by et al . . arabidopsis thaliana plants were grown hydroponically as

shoots and flowers and fractionated by aqueous two phase partitioning as described by yuan et al . . protein concentrations were determined using the bradford protein assay and bovine serum albumin served as the standard . a polyclonal antibody was raised against the peptide representing a sequence of the c terminus of _PROTEIN_ . the antiserum from rabbits was further affinity purified using a nitrocellulose _LOCATION_ for binding of the corresponding peptide . for protein gel blot analysis proteins were electrophoresed on _PROTEIN_ polyacrylamide gels transferred to a polyvinylidene fluoride _LOCATION_ and blots were developed using an ecl advance western blotting detection kit _PROTEIN_ . primary antibodies and secondary antibody were diluted in blocking solution at the
