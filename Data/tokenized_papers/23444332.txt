leaf size and shape are _PROTEIN_ determined by coordinated cell division and differentiation in lamina . the cincinnata like teosinte transcription _PROTEIN_ are key regulators of leaf development . however the _METHOD_ that control tcp activities during leaf development are largely unknown . we identified the tcp interactor containing ear motif _PROTEIN_ a novel transcriptional repressor as a major modulator of tcp activities during leaf development . overexpression of _PROTEIN_ leads to hyponastic and serrated leaves whereas disruption of _PROTEIN_ causes epinastic leaves . _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ in young leaves and encodes a transcriptional repressor containing a c terminal ear motif which mediates interactions with the topless _PROTEIN_ /topless related corepressors . in addition _PROTEIN_ physically interacts with cin like tcps . we propose that _PROTEIN_ regulates leaf size and morphology by inhibiting the activities of tcps through recruiting the _PROTEIN_ corepressors to form a _PROTEIN_ complex at early stages of leaf development .
we previously identified and characterized mutants with curly leaves from a collection of activation tagged arabidopsis mutants . in the present study an additional curly leaf mutant _PROTEIN_ d was characterized . unlike wild type leaves which were flat the _PROTEIN_ d leaves were curled upwards . the leaves of _PROTEIN_ d were also smaller and narrower than those of wild type plants . the leaf margins of the mutant were wavy and more serrated . epidermal cells from mature leaves of _PROTEIN_ d mutants were polygonal whereas wild type cells had a typical jigsaw shape . the _PROTEIN_ d mutant had much smaller leaf cells than the wild type suggesting that _PROTEIN_ may affect leaf cell differentiation . we determined that _PROTEIN_ d was a gain of function mutant . the _PROTEIN_ d phenotypes were caused by a single t dna insertion located in the intergenic region between and _GENE_ . the t dna insertion cosegregated with the _PROTEIN_ d phenotypes and led to a significant increase in the _PROTEIN_ level of _GENE_ . we generated the construct _GENE_ in which _GENE_ was driven by a cauliflower mosaic virus promoter and transformed it into wild type arabidopsis independent transgenic lines displayed hyponastic leaves indicating that overexpression of _GENE_ phenocopied _PROTEIN_ d. most transgenic lines also produced hyponastic cotyledons . _GENE_ was also overexpressed under the control of its own promoter and four copies of camv enhancers a construct that mimics the t dna insertion in the _PROTEIN_ d mutants . seventy six independent transgenic lines displayed curly leaf phenotype . these results indicated that _PROTEIN_ d phenotypes were caused by the increased _PROTEIN_ levels of _GENE_ . thus _GENE_ was designated as _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ encodes a protein of amino acids that contains a basic region followed by a helix region in the n terminal region . interestingly a typical ear motif is located at the c terminal end of the _PROTEIN_ protein suggesting that _PROTEIN_ may function as a transcriptional repressor . _PROTEIN_ also contains a putative monopartite _LOCATION_ localization signal located in the n terminus of the _PROTEIN_ protein . we found three genes in the arabidopsis genome _GENE_ _GENE_ and _GENE_ encoding proteins with high amino acid sequence similarity to _PROTEIN_ which were thus designated as _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ respectively . to test whether _PROTEIN_ is a transcriptional repressor we first _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ with a c terminal green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ tag in arabidopsis under the control of a camv promoter . twenty one independent transgenic plants displayed small hyponastic leaves that were similar to those of _PROTEIN_ d mutants demonstrating that the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein was functional . the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein was clearly localized in the _LOCATION_ indicating that _PROTEIN_ is a _LOCATION_ protein . then we generated a reporter construct uas gus in which the _PROTEIN_ gene was under the control of a synthetic promoter that contained six copies of binding site fused with a camv promoter . we fused _PROTEIN_ to the dna binding domain to generate _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and cotransformed uas gus with _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ into tobacco leaves to determine _PROTEIN_ transcriptional activities . as expected gus staining was strong in leaves cotransformed with uas gus and _PROTEIN_ combination . however gus _PROTEIN_ was severely attenuated when uas gus was cotransformed with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ suggesting that _PROTEIN_ is probably a transcriptional repressor . we then tested whether the ear motif in _PROTEIN_ was responsible for the repression activity of _PROTEIN_ . we fused the dna binding domain either with _PROTEIN_ in which ear motif was deleted or with _PROTEIN_ in which the conserved leu residues in the ear motif were changed to ser residues . unlike _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ did not repress gus _PROTEIN_ in tobacco leaves . these results indicate that the ear motif is required for the repression activities of _PROTEIN_ . recent studies revealed that _PROTEIN_ and tpr proteins interacted with the ear motif to function as corepressors in auxin and jasmonic acid signaling pathways . _PROTEIN_ interacted with the _PROTEIN_ n terminal region which is reported to be sufficient for _PROTEIN_ to interact with ear containing proteins . the interaction between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ was dependent on the ear motif as deletion of the ear motif _PROTEIN_ or mutation of the three conserved leu residues of the ear motif _PROTEIN_ abolished the interaction between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . the interaction between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ was confirmed in a bimolecular _METHOD_ complementation assay . our results also showed that _PROTEIN_ interacted with all of the tpr proteins including _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ but not with _PROTEIN_ which interacts with some ear containing transcription _PROTEIN_ . our data suggest that _PROTEIN_ probably recruits _PROTEIN_ rather than _PROTEIN_ to form a transcriptional repressor complex . to test this hypothesis we fused _PROTEIN_ with the c terminal portion of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . we expected that _PROTEIN_ is not functional as a repressor but _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ should behave similarly in plants . indeed four independent transgenic lines in which the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was driven by a camv promoter led to curly leaf phenotypes similar to those observed in _PROTEIN_ d . however the curly leaf phenotypes may also be caused by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ fused with other corepressors such as _PROTEIN_ . to further clarify the relationship between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ we crossed _PROTEIN_ d to the tpl mutant . the small and up curled leaf phenotype of d was largely rescued in the double mutant d /tpl suggesting that _PROTEIN_ is required for the function of _PROTEIN_ . these results indicate that _PROTEIN_ functions as a transcriptional repressor during leaf development by interacting with _PROTEIN_ through the ear motif . to investigate the spatial and temporal _PROTEIN_ pattern of _PROTEIN_ we cloned a bp long promoter fragment of _PROTEIN_ and fused it to the gus reporter gene to generate the construct _PROTEIN_ gus . ten _PROTEIN_ gus transgenic lines showed similar staining patterns . gus activities were observed in shoot apical meristem cotyledons and leaves . in young leaves gus staining was strong at the leaf margins and at the base of the leaves . as the leaves matured gus staining became weaker . initially gus staining was restricted to the leaf margin and the developing vascular bundles of the complete leaf blade . subsequently staining gradually concentrated in the vascular bundles at the base of the leaves as the leaves developed . no gus staining was observed in mature leaves . the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in young leaves and at the leaf margins was consistent with the observed phenotypes of the _PROTEIN_ d mutants in which the leaf marginal regions curled upward . _PROTEIN_ was reported to be _PROTEIN_ in the embryo but it is not clear whether _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ in other tissues . to reveal the _PROTEIN_ pattern of _PROTEIN_ we cloned a kb long promoter fragment of _PROTEIN_ and fused to gus reporter gene to generate the _PROTEIN_ gus construct . five of six _PROTEIN_ gus transgenic lines showed a similar gus staining pattern . strong gus activities were observed in the vascular tissues shoot apical meristem and cotyledons . at _PROTEIN_ seedling stage _PROTEIN_ was strongly _PROTEIN_ in young leaves . we then used quantitative rt pcr to further confirm whether _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are _PROTEIN_ in leaves and found that _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ at higher levels in seedlings than in older plants or old leaves . the results are consistent with those observed from the gus staining of _PROTEIN_ gus transgenic lines . meanwhile _PROTEIN_ was also _PROTEIN_ in leaves . these results indicate that _PROTEIN_ shows an overlapping _PROTEIN_ pattern with _PROTEIN_ in leaves providing spatial evidence for the interaction between these two proteins . we identified one t dna insertion mutant for _PROTEIN_ from the available public mutant collections . however it was not a null mutant and no obvious phenotypes were observed in this mutant . we therefore used the inducible insertional mutagenesis system based on ac ds induction by heat shock to generate knockout mutants for _PROTEIN_ . we first identified one t dna insertion mutant in which the t dna insertion was located at a position kb away from _PROTEIN_ and then performed the heat shock treatment on the homozygous mutants . from _PROTEIN_ plants we identified one mutant plant _PROTEIN_ in which the ds jumped into the splice site of the second intron of _PROTEIN_ and the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ was completely knocked out . although _PROTEIN_ is a _PROTEIN_ null mutant it displayed no obvious leaf phenotype . we speculate that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are functionally redundant with _PROTEIN_ since they have similar domains with _PROTEIN_ and interact with _PROTEIN_ and the other four tpr proteins in yeast two hybrid assays . moreover overexpression of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis led to phenotypes similar to those of _PROTEIN_ d . in order to clarify the _PROTEIN_ pattern of these three genes we conducted rt pcr analysis and found that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were _PROTEIN_ in leaves whereas _PROTEIN_ was not _PROTEIN_ in leaves suggesting that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ may also participate in leaf development . because the dna sequence of _PROTEIN_ is highly similar to _PROTEIN_ we generated an rna interference construct _PROTEIN_ rnai to knock down the _PROTEIN_ of both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . we transformed _PROTEIN_ rnai into _PROTEIN_ and found that nine independent transgenic lines displayed epinastic leaves a phenotype that is opposite to that observed in _PROTEIN_ d mutants . furthermore three independent transgenic plants exhibited even more severe phenotypes for instance production of deformed leaves single cotyledons or cup shaped cotyledons which is similar to tpl mutants . these results indicate that ties play pivotal roles in leaf development . to further investigate the role of _PROTEIN_ in leaf development we _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ which may elicit a dominant negative effect in wild type arabidopsis in an attempt to determine the consequences of inactivation of ties . _PROTEIN_ does not interact with _PROTEIN_ and is no longer a transcriptional repressor . however _PROTEIN_ may compete with and disrupt the endogenous ties . this strategy was used successfully in the study of ear motif containing proteins . _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ by a camv promoter or _PROTEIN_ promoter caused interesting phenotypes . eleven independent _PROTEIN_ transgenic lines displayed epinastic leaves opposite to the leaf phenotypes observed in _PROTEIN_ d mutants . fifteen independent _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ transgenic lines also exhibited epinastic leaves . the leaf epidermal cells of _PROTEIN_ transgenic lines differentiated earlier and the cell sizes were significantly larger than those of the wild type control . these results further confirm that _PROTEIN_ and other ties regulate leaf development possibly by affecting cell differentiation . to further investigate the _PROTEIN_ function we fused the transcriptional activation domain of the protein to mutated _PROTEIN_ in which the ear motif was either deleted or mutated . we hypothesized that overexpression of _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ driven by a camv promoter in transgenic plants was not only able to play a dominant negative role by competing with the endogenous ties but also might activate the target genes of ties that are normally repressed . we found that fifty independent _PROTEIN_ transgenic lines and thirty nine independent _PROTEIN_ transgenic lines produced epinastic leaves a phenotype observed in _PROTEIN_ transgenic lines . furthermore the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ lines displayed more extreme curvature in both cotyledons and leaves than those observed in _PROTEIN_ lines . six _PROTEIN_ as well as four _PROTEIN_ independent transgenic lines produced single cotyledons or fused cotyledons which were similar to those observed in tpl mutants . notably these epinastic and deformed leaf phenotypes were also observed in tpl . these findings are consistent with our observation that _PROTEIN_ interacts with _PROTEIN_ proteins again indicating that _PROTEIN_ plays an important role in leaf development . because _PROTEIN_ does not have an apparent dna binding domain we hypothesized that _PROTEIN_ might bind other transcription _PROTEIN_ to regulate gene _PROTEIN_ . therefore we conducted a yeast two hybrid screen to identify proteins interacting with _PROTEIN_ . although _PROTEIN_ is a transcriptional repressor in plants the full length _PROTEIN_ is able to activate the reporter gene in yeasts . activation of the reporter in yeast by a plant repressor has been reported previously . we then performed deletion analysis and found that the n terminus of _PROTEIN_ residues to showed no transcriptional activation activity in yeasts . we fused this _PROTEIN_ fragment with the dna binding domain to generate the bait for the yeast two hybrid screen and identified cin like tcp transcription _PROTEIN_ . to confirm the interactions between tcps and _PROTEIN_ we cloned all of the cin like tcps in arabidopsis and fused them with the ad domain . all of the cin like tcps were able to interact with _PROTEIN_ in yeast . we verified the association of _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ in vivo using bifc analysis . clear _METHOD_ signals were observed in the _LOCATION_ in the combinations _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ whereas the controls showed no _METHOD_ indicating that _PROTEIN_ physically interacts with _PROTEIN_ in vivo . the _PROTEIN_ that the n terminal region of _PROTEIN_ interacts with tcp transcription _PROTEIN_ and the ear motif in the c terminal region interacts with the corepressor _PROTEIN_ suggests that _PROTEIN_ may serve as a bridge between tcps and _PROTEIN_ . to test this hypothesis we fused tcp genes with the end region of _PROTEIN_ and the fusion construct driven by a camv promoter was transformed into wild type arabidopsis . we expected that the transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ these chimeric proteins would mimic some phenotypes of _PROTEIN_ d in which _PROTEIN_ was overexpressed and _PROTEIN_ had an increased chance to bind with tcp proteins in vivo . as expected independent _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ transgenic plants displayed phenotypes similar to jaw d . eleven independent _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ transgenic plants showed hyponastic leaves similar to those observed in _PROTEIN_ d . these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ may regulate leaf development by interacting with tcp transcription _PROTEIN_ . to further confirm the association of _PROTEIN_ with cin like tcp transcription _PROTEIN_ we examined the _PROTEIN_ profiles of tcp regulated genes when the _PROTEIN_ level was altered . quantitative rt pcr analysis showed that the _PROTEIN_ of all the four class i _PROTEIN_ like homeobox _PROTEIN_ genes comprising _PROTEIN_ like from _PROTEIN_ thaliana _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ shoot meristemless _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ the known target genes of _PROTEIN_ were upregulated in leaves of _PROTEIN_ d . class i _PROTEIN_ genes are well known to _PROTEIN_ the undifferentiated state of cells in the shoot apical meristem . the upregulation of class i _PROTEIN_ genes is consistent with the phenotype of _PROTEIN_ d that the leaf cells are delayed in differentiation . we also examined the _PROTEIN_ of tcp direct target genes _PROTEIN_ asymmetric _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ indoleacetic acid induced protein _PROTEIN_ and the small auxin up rna gene in the leaves of _PROTEIN_ d and found that these four genes were significantly repressed . to investigate whether the repression of these tcp direct target genes is released by the loss of function of _PROTEIN_ we tested the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in the leaves of the wild type /tpl /tpl d double mutants and d. as shown in figure compared with that in leaves of d the repression of _PROTEIN_ in /tpl d was largely released . these results again suggest that _PROTEIN_ plays essential roles in leaf development by regulating some important genes through interacting with tcp transcription _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . it is reported that _PROTEIN_ is one of the _PROTEIN_ regulators of tcp transcription _PROTEIN_ . overexpression of _PROTEIN_ in jaw d mutants causes profound defects in leaf development . we recently identified a jaw d mutant in which four copies of the camv enhancer are located at bp upstream of the _PROTEIN_ gene . the jaw d mutant was designated as jaw after previously reported jaw d mutants . in the jaw d mutant the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ was downregulated but not silenced completely whereas that of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ was not affected . because _PROTEIN_ directly affects tcp mrna levels and _PROTEIN_ represses tcp activities we expected that _PROTEIN_ d jaw would genetically enhance each other . in contrast with the _PROTEIN_ d mutant which displayed serrated and curly leaves and jaw which also showed curvature and wavy margins on the leaves the _PROTEIN_ d jaw double mutants exhibited much more severe phenotypes by producing highly serrated and deeply lobed leaves . interestingly the _PROTEIN_ d jaw double mutant frequently produced ectopic shoots in the sinus of serrations which was consistent with the observations that _PROTEIN_ and other meristem associated genes were upregulated in the leaves of _PROTEIN_ d . this phenotype is also similar to those observed in _PROTEIN_ seedlings in which ectopic shoots are generated on cotyledons . the observed synergistic interactions between _PROTEIN_ d and jaw suggest that _PROTEIN_ interacts with cin like tcps and inhibits their activities . to further clarify the genetic interaction between _PROTEIN_ and tcps we transformed the _PROTEIN_ into _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ triple mutants . five independent lines produced smaller leaves which showed partial rescue of the larger leaves of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . scanning electron microscopy analysis confirmed that the _PROTEIN_ differentiated cell phenotype of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ leaves was also partially rescued suggesting that overexpression of _PROTEIN_ probably activates other tcps _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . we then transformed in which a _PROTEIN_ resistant was driven by a camv promoter into wild type arabidopsis to generate _PROTEIN_ overexpression lines that showed similar phenotypes as previously reported . we crossed line to a _PROTEIN_ overexpression line _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . the leaves of the double overexpression lines were similar to those of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ indicating that the leaf phenotype of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ is epistatic to that of . these observations further support that _PROTEIN_ regulates leaf development by modifying the activities of tcps .
