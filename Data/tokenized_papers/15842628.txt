we have generated a novel genetic system to visualize cell lineages in living tissues at high resolution . heat shock was used to trigger the excision of a specific transposon and activation of a _METHOD_ marker gene . a histone _METHOD_ marker was used to allow identification of cell lineages and easy counting of cells . constitutive _PROTEIN_ of a green _METHOD_ _LOCATION_ protein was used to provide a precise outline of all surrounding cells . marked lineages can be induced from specific cells within the organism by targeted laser irradiation and the fate of the marked cells can be followed non invasively . we have used the system to map cell lineages originating from the initials of primary and _PROTEIN_ roots in arabidopsis . the lineage marking technique enabled us to measure the differential contribution of primary root pericycle cell files to developing _PROTEIN_ root primordia . the majority of cells in an emerging _PROTEIN_ root primordium derive from the central file of pericycle founder cells while off centre founder cells contribute only a minor proliferation of tissue near the base of the root . the system shows great promise for the detailed study of cell division during morphogenesis .
