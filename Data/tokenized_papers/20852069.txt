as one of the most abundant polysaccharides on earth xylan will provide more than a third of the sugars for lignocellulosic _PROTEIN_ production when using grass or hardwood feedstocks . xylan is characterized by a linear linked backbone of xylosyl residues substituted by _PROTEIN_ acid o methylglucuronic acid or arabinose depending on plant species and cell types . the biological role of these decorations is unclear but they have a major influence on the properties of the polysaccharide . despite the recent isolation of several mutants with reduced backbone the _METHOD_ of xylan synthesis and substitution are unclear . we identified two _LOCATION_ localized putative glycosyltransferases _PROTEIN_ acid substitution of xylan and _PROTEIN_ that are required for the addition of both _PROTEIN_ acid and o methylglucuronic acid branches to xylan in arabidopsis stem cell walls . the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutants show loss of xylan _PROTEIN_ activity and lack almost all detectable xylan substitution . unexpectedly they show no change in xylan backbone quantity indicating that backbone synthesis and substitution can be uncoupled . although the _METHOD_ are weakened the xylem vessels are not collapsed and the plants grow to normal size . the xylan in these plants shows improved extractability from the cell wall is composed of a single monosaccharide and requires fewer enzymes for complete hydrolysis . these findings have implications for our understanding of the synthesis and function of xylan in plants . the results also demonstrate the potential for manipulating and simplifying the structure of xylan to improve the properties of lignocellulose for bioenergy and other uses .
to discover unique gx biosynthetic enzymes we searched for putative _PROTEIN_ that are coexpressed with known xylan synthesis proteins and that are colocalized with other polysaccharide synthesis enzymes in the _LOCATION_ apparatus . approximately characterized and putative _PROTEIN_ from arabidopsis are categorized by homology into families in the cazy database . we clustered all of the arabidopsis predicted _PROTEIN_ according to their coexpression in different plant organs . only two additional putative _PROTEIN_ _GENE_ and _GENE_ are coexpressed with these xylan synthesis genes . for reasons outlined below we now refer to them as _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . these _PROTEIN_ have previously been shown to be coexpressed with secondary wall synthesis enzymes . they are members of a subfamily of five enzymes belonging to cazy family _PROTEIN_ fig . . closely related genes and are _PROTEIN_ during wood formation in poplar . however _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ have previously been characterized as the starch initiation proteins _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . the proteins were predicted to localize to the chloroplast a finding inconsistent with a role in secondary cell wall synthesis . nevertheless in a quantitative proteomic approach to identify proteins in the _LOCATION_ apparatus of arabidopsis cell cultures we showed that the closely related protein _GENE_ is _LOCATION_ localized . this suggested that this family of five _PROTEIN_ proteins might be _LOCATION_ localized and have a role in cell wall synthesis . indeed all five predicted proteins have a single n terminal putative transmembrane domain typical of _LOCATION_ localized _PROTEIN_ . to clarify the subcellular localization _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ proteins were fused to _METHOD_ and transiently _PROTEIN_ in nicotiana tabacum . both were found to colocalize with the _LOCATION_ sugar nucleotide transporter _PROTEIN_ indicating that the proposed role in _LOCATION_ starch synthesis is unlikely . to investigate a role for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in secondary cell wall polysaccharide biosynthesis two independent t dna insertional mutant lines for each gene were identified _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and confirmed as transcriptional knockouts . cell wall alcohol insoluble residue was prepared from the basal _METHOD_ of these plants a tissue rich in secondary cell wall . the air was characterized with polysaccharide analysis by _PROTEIN_ gel electrophoresis _PROTEIN_ using xylan specific glycosylhydrolases . the air was first deesterified and solubilized with m naoh and then digested to completion with excess xylanase . hydrolysis of wt stem air released xyl and and glca . notably the hydrolysis of _PROTEIN_ air showed a clear _PROTEIN_ in the intensity of the glca band suggesting the mutant contained reduced glca substitution of the xylan _PROTEIN_ . to investigate the modified xylan phenotype further the frequency of glca substitution of xyl was estimated by _PROTEIN_ in two alleles of both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants . xyl and glca oligosaccharides released by xylanase digestion were quantitated . the _PROTEIN_ mutants showed a reduction to of wt frequency of glca substitution . the _PROTEIN_ mutants also showed a small but significant reduction to about of wt . we next made double _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutants to investigate the combined role of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in xylan substitution . even though xylanase digests of air released xyl and and some indicating xylan was present in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutants the glca oligosaccharides were almost undetectable . previous work has shown that in some species at least glca side chain addition is closely coupled with xylan backbone synthesis . however quantitation of xylanase released oligosaccharides indicated that there was no difference in the amount of xylan backbone between wt single and double gux mutants despite the reduction in side chain addition . next the monosaccharide composition of noncellulosic polymers of wt and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutants was analyzed . consistent with the finding that the xylan backbone synthesis was unaltered the neutral monosaccharide composition including xyl was not significantly changed . in contrast glca was significantly reduced in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . the reduction is consistent with loss from gx and remaining glca may arise from pectin arabinogalactan proteins and primary cell wall _PROTEIN_ . in all gx synthesis mutants studied to date the glca is partially or entirely replaced by meglca but together the proportion of xyl residues substituted in the xylan is unaltered at . to investigate whether the reduction in glca substitution in the gux mutants is due to loss specifically of meglca or glca deuteropermethylated xylanase released oligosaccharides were analyzed by maldi tof . although glca appears slightly reduced relative to meglca in _PROTEIN_ and in _PROTEIN_ single mutants both types of substitution were affected in each mutant . consistent with the _PROTEIN_ analysis both glca and meglca substituted oligosaccharides were scarcely detectable in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . together these analyses suggest that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are responsible for almost all of the substitution of the xylan backbone in arabidopsis stem gx and perhaps the remaining gx substitution could arise from the activity of the three other gux family members . the absence of glca substitution of xylan in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ suggests that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are required for substitution of the xyl backbone . a nonradioactive assay was developed to detect guxt activity in stem microsomes using udp glca and the acceptor molecule labeled at the reducing end with the uncharged fluorophore aminoacridone . in this assay products containing both a negative charge from glca and the _METHOD_ labeled acceptor molecule are separated and visualized in a polyacrylamide gel whereas uncharged oligosaccharides such as the acceptor are unable to enter the gel . with wt microsomes a ladder of charged oligosaccharides was produced putatively glca n from guxt in combination with xylosyltransferase _PROTEIN_ extending the amac acceptor . however the guxt activity was strongly reduced in the double mutant . the oligosaccharides appeared in a time dependent manner and required the presence of wt microsomal protein and amac acceptor and it was stimulated by udp glca . a small amount of product was formed in the absence of exogenous udp glca perhaps from nucleotide sugars in the microsome preparation . udp xyl inclusion in the assay was not necessary as it arises by conversion of udp glca to udp xyl in the _LOCATION_ . the activity of _PROTEIN_ was unaffected in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutant . to confirm that the oligosaccharides were glca n amac we showed that they were hydrolyzed by xylanase . the oligosaccharides were also sensitive to xylosidase indicating that they have unsubstituted xyl residues at their nonreducing end . the bands were insensitive to a _PROTEIN_ confirming that they did not have glca at the nonreducing end of the oligosaccharide . importantly the oligosaccharides disappeared after treatment with _PROTEIN_ plus xylosidase confirming their charge was from glca on a xylan oligosaccharide . together these data indicate that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ stem microsomes have strongly reduced ability to transfer glca from udp glca onto xylooligosaccharide acceptors . the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plants provide a unique opportunity to investigate the biological role of the glca substitution on xylan deposition and interaction with other wall components . despite the altered xylan structure there was no observable growth or developmental phenotype in single or double gux mutants . unlike other xylan synthesis mutants which show collapsed xylem vessels microscopic analysis of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutant stem sections revealed predominantly normal xylem . _METHOD_ labeling with two antixylan antibodies confirmed that xylan was present throughout the cell walls in all of the mutants . interestingly labeling was stronger in the double mutants than the wt suggesting that more epitopes were accessible to the antibodies . the cell walls appeared normal by transmission electron microscopy and the _PROTEIN_ was not significantly different _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . a four point bending test provided a quantitative assessment of strength of the cell walls in _METHOD_ and showed that the double mutant was slightly weaker than wt . together these data indicate that despite some reduction in strength the development and function of the secondary cell walls are largely unaffected by the absence of branching on the xylan . to investigate any changed interaction between the xylan and other cell wall components polysaccharides were sequentially chemically extracted from stem air . the solubilized polysaccharides were digested with the xylanase and analyzed by _PROTEIN_ . as expected only trace amounts of xylan were released in the cyclohexanediaminetetraacetic acid and fractions which solubilize _PROTEIN_ pectic polysaccharides . in wt although the majority of xylan was solubilized by m koh a substantial amount was found in the m koh fraction and in the residue . in contrast nearly all of the xylan in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was extracted by m koh . monosaccharide analysis of these fractions confirmed that the xylan in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was much more easily extracted . interestingly the solubility at neutral ph of alkali extracted xylan from the wt and mutants was very different whereas gx is normally soluble the unsubstituted gux xylan precipitated . finally it is recognized that gx substituents can inhibit the access of hydrolytic enzymes to the xylan backbone and the glycosidic bond between glca and xyl is resistant to acid hydrolysis . thus after acid hydrolysis or saccharification oligosaccharides with substitution can remain . therefore this substitution can directly prevent complete release of pentose monosaccharide for fermentation . we measured release of xyl using a simple enzyme mixture of a xylanase and xylosidase from wt and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ air after solubilization with alkali . unlike wt xylan with glca substitution all of the xylan in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ could be hydrolyzed to monosaccharide sugar in the presence of two enzymes more than doubling the yield of free xylose . the xylan in the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ xylan backbone synthesis mutants have unaltered substitution frequency and therefore show little difference in hydrolysis to the wt xylan .
