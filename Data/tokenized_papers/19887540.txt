we have isolated a combination of high light and heat shock _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ stress inducible genes including a nac transcription _PROTEIN_ designated _PROTEIN_ . here we explored the physiological function of _PROTEIN_ under _PROTEIN_ stress . yeast transcription activity assays showed that _PROTEIN_ functions as a transcriptional activator . a fusion protein composed of green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ and full length _PROTEIN_ was detected in the _LOCATION_ and cytoplasm while fusion proteins comprising _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ deleted of a putative transmembrane motif were found only in the _LOCATION_ . in _PROTEIN_ overexpressing arabidopsis plants _PROTEIN_ the transcription of genes was up regulated compared with the levels in wild type plants under _PROTEIN_ . these genes included some for transcription _PROTEIN_ regulating the _PROTEIN_ of genes related to the biosynthesis of flavonoids . interestingly the transcript levels of some genes related to flavonoid biosynthesis and the levels of anthocyanins were significantly increased in ox _PROTEIN_ plants and reduced in knockout _PROTEIN_ plants _PROTEIN_ compared with wild type plants under _PROTEIN_ stress . the present findings suggest that _PROTEIN_ protein is associated with the induction of genes related to flavonoid biosynthesis leading to the accumulation of anthocyanins in response to _PROTEIN_ stress .
to determine whether _PROTEIN_ acts as a transcriptional activator we adopted yeast transcription activity assays utilizing full length _PROTEIN_ or truncated _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ of _PROTEIN_ which were _PROTEIN_ fused to the dna binding domain in the yeast strain containing four reporter genes _PROTEIN_ . activation domain and proteins were used as positive and negative controls respectively . judging from the growth of yeast cells on tryptophan histidine and adenine lacking plates the fusion proteins comprising and or _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ activated _PROTEIN_ of the and reporter genes while the proteins _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ did not activate any reporter genes . all yeast clones grew equally well on plates containing histidine and adenine . the activity of galactosidase in yeast cells _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ was and fold higher respectively than that in the negative control cells . there was no significant difference in activity between the cells _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ and the negative control cells . the _PROTEIN_ protein contained an helical transmembrane motif in the c terminal region and thus was predicted to be _LOCATION_ associated . to confirm its subcellular distribution the _PROTEIN_ protein was fused to the green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ and transiently _PROTEIN_ in onion epidermal cells . the fusion protein comprising _METHOD_ and full length _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was detected in the _LOCATION_ and the cytoplasm and _METHOD_ alone was also detected in the cytoplasm and _LOCATION_ . the fusion proteins composed of _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ deleted of a putative tm motif _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ were found only in the _LOCATION_ . to explore the regulatory system for _PROTEIN_ the gene _PROTEIN_ in response to _PROTEIN_ stress was analyzed using an rna gel blot . the transcript level of _PROTEIN_ increased within min under _PROTEIN_ stress . furthermore the time course of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was analyzed using the quantitative pcr method . the transcript level of _PROTEIN_ increased rapidly and reached a peak at min under _PROTEIN_ stress . to analyze tissue specific _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ we constructed a chimeric gene consisting of the _PROTEIN_ promoter fused to a _PROTEIN_ reporter gene . the _PROTEIN_ promoter included the sequence from kb upstream to bp downstream of the site of initiation of transcription . two week old wild type and transgenic arabidopsis plants were exposed to _PROTEIN_ stress . rna gel blot analysis revealed that the transcript levels of the gus gene under the control of the _PROTEIN_ promoter and endogenous _PROTEIN_ were clearly increased under _PROTEIN_ stress . gus activity was detected in the rosette leaves and roots of transgenic arabidopsis plants grown under normal conditions while it was more strongly detected in transgenic plants exposed to _PROTEIN_ stress . however there was no difference in histochemical localization of gus activity in the gus plants between normal conditions and _PROTEIN_ stress . additionally gus activity was detected in the vascular tissues of _METHOD_ roots and leaf veins . to identify the genes targeted by _PROTEIN_ we generated transgenic arabidopsis plants overexpressing _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus promoter which was a highly _PROTEIN_ line among > independent transformed lines . in the ox _PROTEIN_ plants the transcript level of _PROTEIN_ was fold higher than that of wild type plants . the growth and appearance of the ox _PROTEIN_ plants were similar to those of wild type plants under normal conditions . next we conducted a transcriptome analysis of ox _PROTEIN_ and wild type plants using a dna microarray at h under _PROTEIN_ stress . the transcript levels of genes were increased while those of genes were _PROTEIN_ in the ox _PROTEIN_ plants compared with the wild type plants . most up regulated genes in the _PROTEIN_ plants were involved in metabolism transcription protein destination and cellular transport and transport _METHOD_ . down regulated genes were involved in metabolism transcription cellular transport and transport _METHOD_ and cellular communication/signal transduction . in the ox _PROTEIN_ plants the up regulated genes included those for transcription _PROTEIN_ regulating the _PROTEIN_ of genes related to the biosynthesis of flavonoids such as _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ encode the myb domain protein and are also called _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ respectively . _PROTEIN_ encodes the _PROTEIN_ type zinc finger protein . therefore we confirmed the transcript levels of five genes in wild type and ox _PROTEIN_ plants at h under normal conditions and _PROTEIN_ stress using a quantitative pcr method . however the _PROTEIN_ transcripts were not detected in wild type and ox _PROTEIN_ plants under normal conditions and _PROTEIN_ stress . there was no significant difference in the transcript level of _PROTEIN_ between wild type and ox _PROTEIN_ plants under _PROTEIN_ stress . under normal conditions the transcription of _PROTEIN_ was up regulated in the ox _PROTEIN_ plants compared with that in the wild type plants . the transcript levels of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were increased under _PROTEIN_ stress in wild type and ox _PROTEIN_ plants . furthermore transcript levels of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were higher in ox _PROTEIN_ plants than wild type plants . to clarify in more detail the system by which _PROTEIN_ regulates the biosynthesis of flavonoids we obtained an arabidopsis line _PROTEIN_ containing a t dna insert in the second exon of _PROTEIN_ from the signal project . quantitative pcr analysis revealed that insertion of the t dna into the gene resulted in a complete loss of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ at the transcriptional level under normal conditions or _PROTEIN_ stress . the growth and appearance of the ko _PROTEIN_ plants were similar to those of wild type plants under normal conditions . no significant differences were observed in the transcript levels of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ between the wild type and ko _PROTEIN_ plants under normal conditions . the transcript level of _PROTEIN_ in the ko _PROTEIN_ plants under normal conditions was lower than that in the wild type plants . under _PROTEIN_ stress the transcript levels of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were significant lower in ko _PROTEIN_ plants than in wild type plants next we examined the transcript levels of genes related to flavonoid biosynthesis _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and for transcription _PROTEIN_ regulating the _PROTEIN_ of those genes _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and enhancer of _PROTEIN_ under normal conditions and _PROTEIN_ stress . in the wild type plants the transcript levels of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were increased under _PROTEIN_ stress while the transcript levels of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were not changed . in ox _PROTEIN_ plants transcript levels of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were higher than those in wild type plants under normal conditions . under _PROTEIN_ stress the transcript levels of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in ox _PROTEIN_ plants were more increased compared with those in the wild type plants . no significant differences were observed in the transcript levels of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ between the wild type and ko _PROTEIN_ plants . however the transcript levels of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were significant lower in ko _PROTEIN_ plants than wild type plants under _PROTEIN_ stress . anthocyanins are water soluble _LOCATION_ pigments that may appear red purple or blue according to ph and belong to the flavonoids . we analyzed the levels of anthocyanin in wild type ox _PROTEIN_ and ko _PROTEIN_ plants under normal conditions and _PROTEIN_ stress . under normal conditions the levels were slightly higher in the ox _PROTEIN_ plants than wild type plants . however there were no significant differences between wild type and ko _PROTEIN_ plants . at days under _PROTEIN_ stress the levels of anthocyanins were increased in wild type ox _PROTEIN_ and ko _PROTEIN_ plants . in ox _PROTEIN_ plants the levels were significantly higher than those in the wild type plants . in contrast the levels in ko _PROTEIN_ plants were low compared with those in wild type plants .
