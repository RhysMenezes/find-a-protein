during cell division the mitotic spindle partitions chromosomes into daughter _LOCATION_ . in higher plants the molecular _METHOD_ governing spindle assembly and function remain largely unexplored . here live cell imaging of mitosis in arabidopsis thaliana plants lacking a kinesin _PROTEIN_ reveals defects during early spindle formation . beginning during prophase and lasting until _PROTEIN_ prometaphase spindles of _PROTEIN_ plants become abnormally elongated are frequently bent and have splayed poles by prometaphase . the period of spindle elongation during prophase and prometaphase is prolonged in _PROTEIN_ cells . time lapse imaging of yellow _METHOD_ protein _PROTEIN_ reveals colocalization with perinuclear microtubules before _LOCATION_ envelope breakdown after which it congresses inward from the poles to the midzone where it becomes progressively enriched at regions of overlap between antiparallel microtubules . in vitro microtubule motility assays demonstrate that in the presence of _PROTEIN_ two microtubules encountering one another at an angle can interact and coalign forming a linear bundle . these data indicate that _PROTEIN_ participates in the search and capture of antiparallel interpolar microtubules where it aids in generating force to coalign microtubules thereby affecting spindle length width and integrity .
previous studies using tubulin _METHOD_ on _PROTEIN_ cells revealed _PROTEIN_ broadened mitotic spindles during metaphase and anaphase . the midzone accumulation of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was in accordance with broadening at the spindle midzone although it was unclear how the spindle poles also became splayed . to understand how _PROTEIN_ contributes to spindle pole integrity we stably transformed wild type and _PROTEIN_ plants with a chimeric gene construct harboring a fusion between green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ and arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ and used plants with detectable levels of _METHOD_ in dividing cells of the root tip for high spatiotemporal resolution imaging of spindle formation and function . all transgenic plants exhibited normal morphologies and growth parameters and the structure and function of mt arrays were not noticeably affected over a range of transgene _PROTEIN_ levels . figure shows the progression through mitosis in a representative cell from wild type root tips which supports documented observations . during _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ prophase in typical wild type cells a broad preprophase band _PROTEIN_ of mts _METHOD_ beneath the cortex encircling the _LOCATION_ and progressively narrows as the cell approaches the onset of mitosis . concurrent with _PROTEIN_ narrowing mts appear in the vicinity of the _LOCATION_ envelope and subsequently become distributed into two poles on opposite sides of the _LOCATION_ to form the prophase spindle the axis of which is perpendicular to the plane of the _PROTEIN_ . mts emanating from these poles are oriented tangentially to the _LOCATION_ surface and extend along the surface of the _LOCATION_ to the equatorial region where they overlap with mts from the opposite pole or they extend _PROTEIN_ and interact with the _PROTEIN_ . soon after pole formation the prophase spindle begins elongating in a direction parallel to its long axis . this elongation continues through _LOCATION_ envelope breakdown with the spindle achieving maximum length during prometaphase after which mts congress inward to form the metaphase spindle . after anaphase is completed mts congress back to the equatorial region to give rise to the phragmoplast which deposits cell plate material as it expands outward . figure shows the progression through mitosis in a representative cell from _PROTEIN_ root tips . beginning during prophase spindle elongation and lasting until the end of prometaphase spindles of _PROTEIN_ cells become abnormally elongated with splayed spindle poles and often display a bent morphology . throughout prophase spindle elongation the mean pole to pole spindle length is significantly greater in _PROTEIN_ spindles compared with the corresponding stage in wild type spindles . this difference becomes more pronounced as cells progress into prometaphase however by metaphase mutant spindles have shortened to lengths similar to wild type spindles . mean _PROTEIN_ spindle length during _PROTEIN_ prophase is versus in wild type cells . during prometaphase mean spindle length increases to in _PROTEIN_ cells versus in wild type cells . during metaphase and anaphase _PROTEIN_ spindle lengths are not significantly different from those of the wild type . in agreement with our previous results using tubulin _METHOD_ metaphase and anaphase spindles in _PROTEIN_ plants are significantly wider at the midzone and poles . here we observed that this broadening manifested first as a splaying of the poles during prometaphase then _PROTEIN_ at the midzone during metaphase . at prometaphase _PROTEIN_ spindle poles are broader than those of the wild type whereas the width measured at the spindle midzone is not significantly different at this stage . the mean spindle width measured at the poles was found to be for _PROTEIN_ and for the wild type whereas the mean midzone width was for _PROTEIN_ and for the wild type . during prometaphase and metaphase spindles of _PROTEIN_ also exhibit less structural integrity than those of the wild type . wild type spindles _PROTEIN_ an ordered appearance with little noticeable movement of the well aligned kinetochore fibers whereas _PROTEIN_ spindles appear much more disorganized with individual kinetochore fibers displaying a greater degree of autonomy and movement during metaphase . this is most evident at the broadened poles of _PROTEIN_ spindles which appear highly disorganized and unstable . overall _PROTEIN_ spindles appear deficient in _PROTEIN_ interactions between neighboring kinetochore bundles resulting in broader and less compact spindle structure compared with wild type spindles . in addition to elongated prophase/prometaphase spindles the duration of this stage is significantly extended in _PROTEIN_ . measuring the time from the start of prophase spindle elongation until the maximum length is reached during prometaphase spindles from _PROTEIN_ cells elongate for an average of min versus min in wild type cells . a slight increase in the duration between prometaphase and anaphase is also observed . as shown in figure the rate of spindle elongation appeared normal in _PROTEIN_ cells suggesting that this increased duration of prophase/prometaphase is not attributable to slowed separation of poles but instead is the result of an extended period of elongation . to test whether this increased duration was caused by a premature initiation or delayed termination of spindle elongation the _PROTEIN_ was used as a marker for mitotic status because its width _PROTEIN_ in a timely and predictable manner as the spindle develops . to determine whether prophase spindle elongation began earlier in _PROTEIN_ cells _PROTEIN_ widths were measured at the start of prophase spindle elongation . _PROTEIN_ widths are significantly greater at this stage in _PROTEIN_ compared with the wild type _PROTEIN_ suggesting that elongation starts early in _PROTEIN_ cells . additionally maximum prometaphase spindle lengths were seen to coincide with _PROTEIN_ disappearance in both _PROTEIN_ and the wild type further indicating that spindle elongation ended at the normal time and did not extend further . lastly in _PROTEIN_ cells spindle elongation was seen to begin coincident with the establishment of prophase spindle bipolarity whereas an accumulation of mts at the poles was evident before spindle elongation in wild type cells . anaphase duration and spindle elongation rates are unaffected in _PROTEIN_ spindles . kinetics of mitotic spindle development because live imaging of mitosis in _PROTEIN_ cells revealed defects in prophase/prometaphase spindle formation we sought to explore the dynamic changes of _PROTEIN_ localization in dividing cells specifically at this stage to better understand the site of _PROTEIN_ force generation . therefore we used arabidopsis plants stably _PROTEIN_ a _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion protein . previous work showed that this fusion protein tracks mt plus ends during interphase exhibits minus end motility in vitro and localizes to mitotic spindle midzones in tobacco by cells . all lines analyzed _PROTEIN_ low levels of transgene _METHOD_ and did not affect the morphology or behavior of mt arrays . the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ chimeric protein can function in vivo as homozygous _PROTEIN_ plants _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ show a significant _PROTEIN_ in spindle lengths compared with untransformed mutant plants . figure shows frames from a time series depicting the localization of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in a mitotic cell from a wild type arabidopsis root tip . during prophase _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ localizes to mts of the _PROTEIN_ and prophase spindle . as the prophase spindle elongates and progresses to prometaphase _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ localizes to mts of the fusiform spindle and becomes progressively enriched on mt bundles overlapping the spindle midzone while simultaneously becoming depleted at the poles . by metaphase the spindle poles have broadened and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ is concentrated predominantly in the spindle midzone . this steady shift in _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ accumulation from poles to the midzone during spindle formation provides an explanation of the gradual broadening of poles seen in arabidopsis spindles as they approach metaphase . these data show localization of _PROTEIN_ to early prometaphase spindle midzones presumably before a substantial number of kinetochore fibers have formed suggesting that _PROTEIN_ force generation during prometaphase occurs at regions of overlap between antiparallel interpolar mts . to test the hypothesis that _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ localizes to interpolar mts during the prophase/prometaphase transition we analyzed _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ dynamics in a tobacco by cell line harboring an mbd ds red fusion protein which is used to visualize mts . by cells were chosen because of their large spindles and substantial midzones making them well suited for studies requiring high spatiotemporal resolution . before neb a fusiform prophase spindle encapsulates the _LOCATION_ and contains numerous mt connections to the narrow _PROTEIN_ . distinct from the situation observed in arabidopsis cells spindles of by cells do not undergo significant prophase/prometaphase spindle elongation . instead at neb/prometaphase the mts congress inward from the poles to the midzone where they are organized into a barrel shaped metaphase spindle . figure shows frames from a time lapse series of a by cell _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and mbd ds red during the transition from prophase to prometaphase . _METHOD_ intensity profiles to the right of each time point were derived from a line drawn along the pole to pole axis of each merged image . dual imaging reveals that _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ initially colocalizes with all spindle mts during prophase . as the _LOCATION_ envelope breaks down and mts congress to the equator _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ appears on _PROTEIN_ mt bundles that span the midzone where it subsequently becomes progressively enriched relative to mts throughout the sequence . coincident with this midzone accumulation of _METHOD_ a proportionate depletion of _METHOD_ occurs at the poles while the mt signal remains predominantly _PROTEIN_ . the midzone spanning mt bundles appear stable as judged by the ability to observe individual bundles for several successive frames often exhibiting pronounced _PROTEIN_ movement within the spindle . these bundles are most likely interpolar mt bundles because they cross the midzone as a continuous entity rather than becoming interrupted by a kinetochore and because they do not exhibit the characteristic fir tree morphology of plant kinetochore bundles . with respect to the pattern of accumulation of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in the midzone examination of supplemental movie online gives the impression that _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ moves on mt bundles from its initial location at the poles to the midzone during prometaphase . figure shows a more favorable cell illustrating this inward movement . the more sparsely populated midzone during early prometaphase in this cell exposed the movement of individual mt bundles more readily . figure shows frames from a time lapse series of the transition from prophase to prometaphase in a by cell _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and mbd ds red . again _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ initially colocalized with all spindle mts during prophase and became progressively enriched in the midzone relative to mts throughout early prometaphase . significantly we noticed that when two bundles from opposite poles encountered each other and coaligned _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ became enriched at the regions of overlap . in this sequence two of these capture events occur the first at s establishes an interpolar mt bundle the second at s reveals the capture and subsequent incorporation of another mt into this same bundle . a kymograph of this time lapse series taken along the long axis of the spindle clearly illustrates the relationship between mts and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ from prophase to prometaphase . notably the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ signal moves from pole to midzone during early prometaphase . these data suggest that _PROTEIN_ moves from the poles to the midzone on early nonkinetochore mts and becomes enriched at regions of overlap between antiparallel oriented mts as interpolar mt connections are established . the observation that _PROTEIN_ localized to regions of overlap between antiparallel interpolar mt bundles in the midzone led us to hypothesize that _PROTEIN_ mediates _PROTEIN_ mt mt interactions . to test this hypothesis _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ as a glutathione s transferase _PROTEIN_ fusion protein in bacteria as described and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ containing cleared bacterial lysates were used for in vitro studies . consistent with observations of several other kinesin family members significant bundling of rhodamine labeled mts was seen to occur in the presence of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . this bundling was not observed with supernatants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ alone . to observe the formation of these bundles a modified mt gliding assay was used in which mts were mixed with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ to allow association with mts in solution before observation on glass slides . when the solution of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and mts was injected into flow cells gliding of single mts as well as linear mt bundles along the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ coated surface was observed . over time the proportion of mts residing within bundles increased as did bundle size . the formation of linear bundles is shown in figure wherein single mts interact and subsequently coalign . figure shows two mts in antiparallel orientation whereas figure shows two parallel mts . in both cases mts glided along the _PROTEIN_ coated cover slip and upon encounter interacted to form a linear bundle . notably even when mts approached one another along different angles of trajectory upon encounter subsequent motility became oriented to a common vector resulting in linear coalignment . the net result is a loss of angle between two mts as they are aligned along a common axis .
