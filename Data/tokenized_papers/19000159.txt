purification of low abundance _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ protein complexes is a _PROTEIN_ task . we devised a tandem affinity purification tag termed the hpb tag which contains the biotin _PROTEIN_ carrier protein domain of arabidopsis methylcrotonal coa _PROTEIN_ . the bccd is biotinylated in vivo and the tagged protein can be captured by streptavidin beads . all five c terminally tagged arabidopsis proteins tested including four pm proteins were functional and biotinylated with high efficiency in arabidopsis . transgenic arabidopsis plants _PROTEIN_ an hpb tagged protein _PROTEIN_ hpb were used to develop a method to purify protein complexes containing the hpb tagged protein . _PROTEIN_ is a _LOCATION_ associated disease resistance protein of low abundance . the purification method involves microsomal fractionation chemical cross linking solubilization and one step affinity purification using magnetic streptavidin beads followed by protein identification using lc _METHOD_ . we identified _PROTEIN_ a known _PROTEIN_ interactor as well as other potential components of the _PROTEIN_ complex . thus the hpb tag method is suitable for the purification of low abundance pm protein complexes .
the bccds of arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ and tomato _PROTEIN_ share identity and similarity . based on the successful use of the bccd of tomato _PROTEIN_ we chose the amino acid sequence at the c terminus of arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ which contains the bccd as the biotin affinity tag in our study . an ha epitope tag and a protease recognition site were placed in front of the biotin tag resulting in a tap tag that was termed the hpb tag . the hpb tag was designed to create c terminal fusions to proteins of interest . biotinylation of the tag facilitates high affinity purification using a streptavidin _PROTEIN_ . if needed a tap strategy can be applied using the hpb tag tagged proteins bound to a streptavidin _PROTEIN_ can be cleaved using the enzyme and released from the _PROTEIN_ and the released protein with the ha tag can be further affinity purified using an anti ha antibody . however we used one step affinity purification based on the biotin streptavidin interaction because it resulted in sufficient purity and allowed much higher yield of the tagged protein than a tap procedure . to facilitate c terminal tagging and _PROTEIN_ of the tagged protein in plants we constructed two destination vectors hpb and pmdc hpb which have two copies of the camv promoter or the _PROTEIN_ promoter respectively . the destination vectors were both produced using the backbone sequence of . a good tag should not affect the function of the tagged protein . five arabidopsis proteins and one e. coli protein _PROTEIN_ were tagged and transgenically _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis . the five arabidopsis proteins included three _LOCATION_ localized r proteins _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ one pm localized _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and one soluble protein _PROTEIN_ that shuttles between the cytoplasm and the _LOCATION_ . _PROTEIN_ hpb and _PROTEIN_ hpb were driven by the _PROTEIN_ promoter . _PROTEIN_ hpb and _PROTEIN_ hpb were driven by their own promoters . _PROTEIN_ hpb and gus hpb were driven by the promoter . an _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant line was transformed with the _PROTEIN_ hpb or _PROTEIN_ hpb constructs . the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutant lines were transformed with the _PROTEIN_ hpb _PROTEIN_ hpb and _PROTEIN_ hpb constructs respectively . col wild type plants were transformed with the gus hpb construct . for each construct two individual or lines each carrying the transgene at a single locus were selected for further study . r proteins confer gene for gene resistance by directly or indirectly recognizing specific effector proteins delivered from pathogens . _PROTEIN_ recognizes the effector _PROTEIN_ recognizes and _PROTEIN_ recognizes avrpphb . recognition results in rapid activation of defense responses and consequent limitation of pathogen growth . it is often associated with localized programmed cell death known as the hypersensitive response at pathogen infection sites . plants with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ limit pathogen growth and display an hr when _PROTEIN_ with pathogens _PROTEIN_ or avrpphb respectively . we tested each of the hpb tagged r genes for complementation of r gene mutations by monitoring bacterial growth and the hr . shows complementation of _PROTEIN_ by _PROTEIN_ hpb . the left panel shows that the titer of pseudomonas syringae pv . tomato _PROTEIN_ was as low in both _PROTEIN_ hpb lines as in wild type col plants but the titer in the parental _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ line was more than times higher . the right panel shows that the hr was as strong in both _PROTEIN_ hpb lines as in wild type plants but was absent in the parental double mutant line . thus _PROTEIN_ hpb was functional . analogous experiments shown in show that _PROTEIN_ hpb and _PROTEIN_ hpb were also functional . _PROTEIN_ can recognize a amino acid peptide from bacterial flagellin and trigger downstream signaling that activates defense responses . pre treatment of wild type plants _PROTEIN_ with induces strong resistance against pto . we pre treated _PROTEIN_ hpb lines with and tested induced resistance to pto . in both _PROTEIN_ hpb lines like wild type plants growth of pto was reduced to fold compared to the _PROTEIN_ mutant indicating that _PROTEIN_ hpb is functional . seedlings of _PROTEIN_ plants are more sensitive to exogenous salicylic acid than those of wild type . by growing seedlings on _METHOD_ agar plates supplemented with sodium salicylate we found that both _PROTEIN_ hpb lines like col were more resistant than the parental _PROTEIN_ mutant to exogenous sa indicating that _PROTEIN_ hpb was functional . histochemical staining of gus enzyme activity in the gus hpb line also indicated that the hpb tag did not affect the gus enzyme function . thus all of the six proteins that we tagged with the hpb tag at their c termini were functional in arabidopsis . next we tested biotinylation of the hpb tagged proteins in arabidopsis . one transgenic line for each construct was arbitrarily chosen to produce protein extracts for detection of biotinylated proteins . _PROTEIN_ hpb _PROTEIN_ hpb _PROTEIN_ hpb _PROTEIN_ hpb and gus hpb proteins were all detected at expected molecular sizes when biotinylated proteins were visualized on a protein blot using peroxidase conjugated streptavidin . two major endogenous biotinylated proteins _PROTEIN_ at approximately kda and the biotin _PROTEIN_ carrier proteins at approximately kda were also detected . the size of _PROTEIN_ hpb is too close to that of _PROTEIN_ to allow them to be distinguished . therefore we captured biotinylated proteins using streptavidin beads and then subjected the captured proteins to protein blotting with an anti ha antibody to detect the ha epitope in _PROTEIN_ hpb . shows that most _PROTEIN_ hpb was captured by streptavidin beads as the amount in the bound fraction was much greater than in the unbound fraction and was comparable to the amount in the total fraction . this indicates that _PROTEIN_ hpb was also efficiently biotinylated . we also examined the biotinylation efficiency in one line each for _PROTEIN_ hpb and gus hpb which are _LOCATION_ associated and soluble respectively . these lines _PROTEIN_ the tagged proteins at relatively high levels which enabled the biotinylation analysis . for these hpb tagged proteins we visualized biotinylated proteins on a protein blot using peroxidase conjugated streptavidin as well as ha tag containing proteins using anti ha antibody . not all biotinylated hpb tagged proteins were captured by the streptavidin beads as we were able to detect biotinylated proteins in the unbound lanes . the important point is that the ratios of band intensities among the total unbound and bound lanes between biotin visualized and ha visualized blots for each of _PROTEIN_ hpb and gus hpb are very similar . if the unbound fraction contains a significant amount of non biotinylated hpb tagged protein the ratio for the ha visualized band in the unbound lane should be greater than the ratio for the biotin visualized band in the unbound lane . therefore these results indicate that most _PROTEIN_ hpb and gus hpb molecules were biotinylated . as we were particularly interested in _PROTEIN_ we proceeded with purification of protein complex containing _PROTEIN_ hpb . there are several advantages to using _PROTEIN_ hpb for technology development . as _PROTEIN_ is tightly associated with the pm a method developed with _PROTEIN_ will probably be applicable to pm proteins in general . as _PROTEIN_ hpb was _PROTEIN_ at a low level in the transgenic line used a method developed with _PROTEIN_ will probably be highly robust . _PROTEIN_ can be used as a positive control because it is known to physically interact with _PROTEIN_ . for improvement of the purification method we focused on four aspects reduction of endogenous biotinylated proteins solubilization of pm proteins capturing biotinylated _PROTEIN_ hpb and cross linking . we found that enrichment of microsomes by centrifugation greatly increased the ratio of _PROTEIN_ hpb to the major endogenous biotinylated proteins . we also explored the possibility of genetically removing major endogenous biotinylated proteins . a t dna insertion line in which the _PROTEIN_ gene was interrupted was morphologically similar to wild type . as _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ involved in leucine degradation in the mitochondria it is unlikely that it will affect pm protein complex formation . we crossed the _PROTEIN_ mutation into _PROTEIN_ hpb line plants . detection of biotinylated proteins from the microsomal fraction clearly showed that _PROTEIN_ was eliminated in _PROTEIN_ hpb _PROTEIN_ plants . therefore _PROTEIN_ hpb _PROTEIN_ plants were used for all further experiments . to solubilize _PROTEIN_ hpb from the microsomes various detergent conditions were tested . lipid rafts a specialized pm structure are not solubilized using mild non ionic triton x at . therefore we included in our tests ionic detergents such as sodium deoxycholate and sodium dodecyl sulfate _PROTEIN_ alone and in combination with non ionic detergents such as triton x and nonylphenyl polyethylene glycol . we found that and w/v sodium deoxycholate alone effectively solubilized _PROTEIN_ hpb from microsomes . interestingly sodium deoxycholate specifically reduced solubilization and capture of the approximately kda biotin _PROTEIN_ carrier protein . using hepes based resuspension buffer containing sodium deoxycholate and mm nacl for solubilization and the following bead binding step _PROTEIN_ hpb was the only major biotinylated protein bound to streptavidin beads . consequently we adopted these conditions . to cross link the components of the _PROTEIN_ hpb protein complex we tested two cross linkers formaldehyde and dithiobis . both are _LOCATION_ permeable and easily reversible or cleavable . formaldehyde has been used to recover soluble gvg protein complex from plant extract in a tap purification approach . dsp has been used for identification of protein transport complexes in the chloroplastic envelope _LOCATION_ and an _LOCATION_ transport receptor complex . we decided to cross link proteins in the microsomal fraction rather than in whole plant tissues because a well controlled cross linking reaction could easily be performed using the microsomal fraction in microfuge tubes and because a small amount of toxic cross linker was sufficient . solubilization of _PROTEIN_ hpb was very difficult after treating microsomes with formaldehyde . on the other hand the majority of _PROTEIN_ hpb was solubilized after cross linking with mm dsp so we decided to use dsp . we further found that mm dsp worked as well as mm dsp with respect to solubilization of _PROTEIN_ hpb capture of _PROTEIN_ hpb with streptavidin beads and co purification of the known interactor _PROTEIN_ . more _PROTEIN_ was co purified when cross linker was used even though less _PROTEIN_ hpb was recovered . we concluded that a cross linking step is necessary for purification of _PROTEIN_ hpb protein complex under our experimental conditions . we inspected the effectiveness of cross linking using mobility shift on _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ gels . protein purification using _PROTEIN_ hpb _PROTEIN_ and wild type was carried out under optimized conditions . both cross link cleaved and non cleaved samples were subjected to _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and protein blotting . as expected both _PROTEIN_ hpb and _PROTEIN_ were detected as clear bands in the cleaved samples . in non cleaved samples _PROTEIN_ hpb was detected as a smear extending towards the high molecular weight side indicating that _PROTEIN_ hpb was cross linked to other proteins . furthermore in the non cleaved sample _PROTEIN_ was not detected at its expected size suggesting that _PROTEIN_ was also cross linked . as mentioned above we decided that it was necessary to use cross linking in our procedure . in general cross linking is an attractive option for revealing interactions that involve _LOCATION_ proteins because it allows use of harsh detergent conditions to solubilize _LOCATION_ proteins without disrupting protein protein interactions . however cross linking may reduce the specificity of identification of protein complex components . as the spacer arm length of dsp is proteins in the vicinity of _PROTEIN_ could be cross linked to _PROTEIN_ even if they do not form complexes with _PROTEIN_ . in view of this protein samples from transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ an unrelated pm protein tagged with hpb would serve as better negative controls than those from plants in which no hpb tagged protein was _PROTEIN_ . some proteins that are cross linked to _PROTEIN_ only due to their close proximity could also be cross linked to the unrelated pm protein . such proteins could be excluded from the list of potential interactors . in any case proteins identified by our procedure that uses cross linking need to be considered as candidates for components of the _PROTEIN_ complex until they are verified by other methods . we conducted large scale purification procedures using _PROTEIN_ hpb _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ control plants . shows a flow chart describing the major steps of the procedure . briefly microsomes were collected from g arabidopsis leaf tissue cross linked with mm dsp solubilized with sodium deoxycholate and then subjected to binding to streptavidin magnetic beads . the captured proteins were then eluted using _PROTEIN_ sample buffer containing a strong reducing agent mercaptoethanol and used for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . a long run of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ resulted in well separated protein bands visualized using silver staining . the _PROTEIN_ control samples contained only a few weak non specific bands except for one major non specific band marked by an arrow . compared with a known amount of gus hpb protein purified from an e. coli strain _PROTEIN_ it more than ng of _PROTEIN_ hpb was estimated to be purified . multiple bands that were specific to the _PROTEIN_ hpb sample were observed which represent _PROTEIN_ complex component candidates . to identify the potential components of the _PROTEIN_ hpb protein complex we subjected the _PROTEIN_ hpb _PROTEIN_ sample and the _PROTEIN_ control sample to tryptic digestion and lc _METHOD_ analysis . a total of eight biological replicates of each sample were analyzed and an inclusion list for targeted detection of peptides with specific m/z values was used in the last two replicates for protein identification . to _PROTEIN_ the false discovery rate we applied the following criteria to select potential _PROTEIN_ complex components identified in some replicates of the _PROTEIN_ hpb sample but never in any replicates of the control sample with protein identification probability > identified at least three times with a protein identification probability of or higher identified at least twice with coverage of two or more peptides _PROTEIN_ . this list included _PROTEIN_ and its known interactor _PROTEIN_ . other proteins on the list were all considered as potential _PROTEIN_ protein complex components although the number of replicates in which they were identified varied . _PROTEIN_ hpb was identified in every replicate . however _PROTEIN_ was not identified every time . we reasoned that this was due to a limitation of the identification method which measures ionized trypsin digested peptides from a complex protein mixture . _PROTEIN_ is a rather small protein and has relatively few peptides available for detection thus it has a relatively low chance of being identified . the order of proteins is in _PROTEIN_ order of confidence.athe number of times that a particular protein was identified in the first six experiments.bthe number of times that a particular protein was identified in the last two experiments for which the inclusion list was used.cthe molecular functions/biological processes listed are _PROTEIN_ according to tair .dincluded in the inclusion list for the last two experiments . to test this possibility we produced an inclusion list containing the _METHOD_ data for theoretical tryptic digests of _PROTEIN_ and a number of other proteins that were arbitrarily chosen based on previous experiments . we analyzed the last two biological replicates by lc _METHOD_ in which the ions with the m/z values specified in the inclusion list were preferentially selected based on the first _METHOD_ results for the subsequent analysis while other ions detected as peaks in the first _METHOD_ were also analyzed . in this way _PROTEIN_ was identified specifically in both replicates of the _PROTEIN_ hpb sample . identification of other proteins was not much improved by use of the inclusion list . this could be because only an incomplete set of peptide information compared to _PROTEIN_ was included in the inclusion list or because they were not recovered in sufficient quantity for identification . the number of peptides that can be on the inclusion list is limited because if there are too many peptides on the list it does not sufficiently narrow the m/z selections . thus we consider an inclusion list as a means to validate known candidates . we also detected non specific proteins present in both the _PROTEIN_ hpb and control samples which are listed in table . the potential _PROTEIN_ complex components are listed in table . some of them may function in _PROTEIN_ mediated resistance . although they are no more than component candidates this discussion could help prioritize them for further research . one aquaporin pm intrinsic protein _PROTEIN_ was identified . some other aquaporin _PROTEIN_ were also detected but did not pass the strict criteria used for the candidate list in table . aquaporin _PROTEIN_ transport water . as plant cells undergoing an hr lose water rapidly aquaporin _PROTEIN_ may play a direct role in the hr response . alternatively the pathogens may try to manipulate aquaporin _PROTEIN_ for their own benefit . for example stomata are the _PROTEIN_ passage for entry of bacterial pathogens into plants and aquaporins may be involved in aba induced closure of stomata . pathogen effectors might modify aquaporins to keep the stomata open . _PROTEIN_ mediated resistance has a positive effect in _PROTEIN_ closure of stomata . aquaporins complexed with _PROTEIN_ might be guarded by _PROTEIN_ and modification of the aquaporins by pathogen effectors might trigger _PROTEIN_ mediated resistance . two band proteins were identified . both of them contain the stomatin/prohibitin/flotillin/hflk/c domain which is present in band proteins of both prokaryotes and eukaryotes . all members of the spfh domain family are enriched in lipid rafts . lipid rafts are specialized pm microdomains that are enriched with sphingolipids and cholesterol and their possible functions in plants have been discussed recently . spfh domain proteins tend to oligomerize and are thought to function as scaffolds . thus the band proteins may provide a scaffold for the _PROTEIN_ complex in lipid rafts . in plants band genes are also referred to as hypersensitive induced reaction genes because some members are highly induced in plant tissue that is undergoing an hr . however it is not known how band proteins are involved in r gene mediated resistance . aquaporin _PROTEIN_ and band family proteins are localized in lipid rafts . as we used chemical cross linking identified candidates may not actually be present in _PROTEIN_ complexes but merely in the vicinity of _PROTEIN_ . even if this is the case our results suggest possible enrichment of _PROTEIN_ in lipid rafts in which pathogen entry and signal transduction events often occur . blue light receptor kinases phototropin _PROTEIN_ and phototropin _PROTEIN_ were identified . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ have overlapping functions in phototropism stomatal opening chloroplast accumulation and leaf expansion and movement . the hr response and sa accumulation triggered by bacterial and viral pathogens are light dependent and phytochrome is involved . it is not known whether phototropin signaling is also involved in the light dependence of r gene mediated responses . epithiospecifier modifier _PROTEIN_ is involved in _PROTEIN_ breakdown and defense against insects . _PROTEIN_ appears to have a regulatory function that inhibits production of nitrile while promoting production of isothiocyanate . although no evidence has been observed for involvement of _PROTEIN_ in insect defense co purification of _PROTEIN_ suggests such a possibility . the potential components that we identified are not necessarily localized in a single protein complex . _PROTEIN_ may be a component of multiple complexes . our approach can not distinguish different complex species . however the identities of the components in these multiple species some of which are specific to particular species will provide us with a means to distinguish them . as an r protein may guard multiple pathogen effector targets and as r protein complexes may undergo dynamic changes upon activation knowledge _PROTEIN_ multiple r protein complex species is important for understanding how the _METHOD_ of r gene mediated resistance are organized .
