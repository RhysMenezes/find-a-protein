metabolic labeling of proteins with a stable isotope in intact arabidopsis plants was used for accurate determination by _METHOD_ _METHOD_ of differences in protein abundance between _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ isolated from leaves and roots . in total proteins were identified of which were predicted to be integral _LOCATION_ proteins . major classes were transporters receptors proteins involved in _LOCATION_ trafficking and cell wall related proteins . forty one of the integral proteins including nine of the _METHOD_ of the _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ aquaporin subfamily could be identified by peptides unique to these proteins which made it possible to determine their relative abundance in leaf and root tissue . in addition peptides shared between _METHOD_ gave information on the proportions of these _METHOD_ . a comparison between our data for protein levels and corresponding data for mrna levels in the widely used database genevestigator showed an agreement for only about two thirds of the proteins . by contrast localization data available in the literature for of the proteins show a much better agreement with our data in particular data based on immunostaining of proteins and gus staining of promoter activity . thus although mrna levels may provide a useful approximation for protein levels detection and quantification of isoform specific peptides by proteomics should generate the most reliable data for the proteome .
_LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ were prepared by aqueous polymer two phase partitioning using a phase system where _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ partition to the upper phase and intracellular _LOCATION_ partition to the interface and to the lower phase . _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ prepared by this technique are usually of high purity and consist _PROTEIN_ of right side out vesicles . the yield of _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ protein was approximately and mg from leaves and roots respectively corresponding to and of total microsomal _LOCATION_ protein respectively . to obtain a measure of the degree of purification of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ fractions immunostaining of the h _PROTEIN_ a canonical _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ protein was compared between the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and microsomal fractions . a strong enrichment of the h _PROTEIN_ was observed for both _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ preparations . leaf microsomal fractions are usually dominated by chloroplast _LOCATION_ whereas root microsomal fractions are usually dominated by mitochondrial _LOCATION_ . therefore immunostaining of light harvesting complex ii a major component of the chloroplast _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and cytochrome oxidase a major component of the mitochondrial inner _LOCATION_ was used to determine the degree of contamination by these _LOCATION_ . as seen in some contamination with mitochondrial _LOCATION_ was found particularly in the root _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ whereas some contamination with _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ was found in the leaf _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . however no integral proteins belonging to the inner mitochondrial _LOCATION_ or to the chloroplast _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ were identified by _METHOD_ . although present as shown by the immunoblots in these proteins obviously fell below the detection limit in the _METHOD_ spectrometer . a low degree of contamination was suggested also by the _METHOD_ data and no marker proteins for any other _LOCATION_ than the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ were detected . the workflow used is outlined in . in the workflow _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ from leaves and roots obtained from plants grown on medium were used for the initial identification of proteins and the construction of a corresponding peptide library . the identification of these peptides was based on _METHOD_ data used for database searches with high stringency total ion score > . amino acid sequences from the peptide identification results were used to calculate the theoretical as well as _METHOD_ of each peptide . these theoretical _METHOD_ were then used to find peptide pairs in the mixed sample spectra . however as matching of _METHOD_ between the peptide library and peptides in the combined samples was based on _METHOD_ data only many false positive matches were detected due to the _PROTEIN_ that one _METHOD_ can fit many different amino acid sequences with the given _METHOD_ accuracy of the _METHOD_ instrumentation used . when a protein is present in both tissues this problem is less pronounced since both and labeled peptide _METHOD_ need to agree with the specific number of nitrogen present in the peptide sequence . the risk of getting a false positive hit is therefore higher when a protein is present in only one tissue and therefore only generates one either or peptide signal . such false positives were identified and removed from the data set by introducing two additional criteria . to be _PROTEIN_ as a true match the peptide identified by _METHOD_ only should originate from the same segment of the _PROTEIN_ polyacrylamide gel as the _METHOD_ identification had been done and from a position where the full size protein would band theoretically and elute at a similar position in the gradient used for nano lc separation as the peptide identified by _METHOD_ . furthermore all spectra that fulfilled all criteria were manually inspected to confirm that the isotopic pattern was correct . to establish the workflow described above and to evaluate the data and its accuracy a number of initial experiments were performed to determine labeling efficiency etc . labeling efficiency was determined by comparing the isotopic signal envelope for the enriched peptides with theoretical isotopic signal envelopes calculated for different degrees of incorporation from to . incorporation was found to be for proteins in both leaf and root tissue and this value was used in the settings file for the software used for the calculations of relative protein abundance . besides matching experimental _METHOD_ of peptides in the peak lists from the combined samples to the theoretical _METHOD_ calculated from the amino acid sequences of peptides used for protein identification we also developed a numerical method for matching the experimental isotopic signal envelope to the theoretical isotopic signal envelope obtained at labeling efficiency . this was done by pairwise comparisons of intensity ratios for neighboring isotope signals in an experimentally obtained envelope with the corresponding intensity ratios for a theoretical envelope . in the left panel shows the theoretical isotope pattern for the peptide dvegpegfqtr from the aquaporin _PROTEIN_ and the right panel shows the experimental isotope pattern of the same peptide . the difference from the theoretical ratio was calculated for each pair of signals and only isotopic envelopes that did not differ more than the threshold values preset in the settings file of the processing software were used for further analysis . this was used to eliminate spectra containing overlapping peptide pair signals as well as spectra for peptides matching theoretical _METHOD_ but with a different amino acid composition . to determine the range within which reliable quantitative data can be obtained as well as the precision of the software a series of samples were prepared by mixing soluble leaf protein extracts from plants grown in and medium respectively at different ratios . the mixed samples were separated by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and two bands were selected excised from each lane and processed according to the workflow in . among the proteins identified in the two bands were the large subunit of ribulose bisphosphate _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and fructose bisphosphate aldolase _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . the q values for six peptide pairs matching rubisco and five peptide pairs matching _PROTEIN_ were determined from the data obtained from each lane . an example of one such peptide pair from _PROTEIN_ for which quantitative data was obtained is shown in with the experimentally determined q values indicated in each panel . the agreement between the experimentally determined q values and the expected theoretical values for all peptide pairs is shown in . note that we have defined the relative abundance of and labeled peptides as the fraction of labeled species and refer to this as the q value for that peptide . thus a q value of indicates that the protein is present at equal abundance in the two samples . a q value of indicates that the protein is more abundant in the labeled sample compared to the labeled sample and a q value of means that the protein is times as abundant in the labeled sample compared to the labeled sample . for less abundant peptides q values > and < are considered to be uncertain due to the low signal strength of either the or labeled peptide and may be interpreted as and respectively . there were no differences between plants grown on and media visible to the naked eye and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ showed very similar polypeptide patterns for leaf and root _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ respectively irrespective of growth medium . such a similarity in polypeptide patterns was first reported for _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ derived from leaves and roots of barley and has _PROTEIN_ also been observed for _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ from other tissues such as leaves xylem and cambium/phloem from poplar trees suggesting that there is a basic set of proteins common to all _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ which was confirmed by proteomics in the poplar study . arabidopsis plants were grown on and media respectively . leaf and root _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ were isolated and subjected to _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ as well as mixtures of leaf and root _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and vice versa . to exclude differences at the protein level caused by growth on the two different media _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ from leaves obtained from plants grown in and from roots obtained from plants and vice versa were mixed at a ratio of and subjected to _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . different _METHOD_ of the aquaporin protein family were identified in both leaf and root tissue _PROTEIN_ members of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ intrinsic protein _PROTEIN_ subfamily . in we show spectra for three peptide pairs matching three different _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ from experiments in which either the leaf material was from plants and the root material was from plants or vice versa . the obtained q values for each and set of peptide pairs correlate very well with each other which indicates that growth on medium did not affect the protein composition of the plants compared to growth on medium . spectra and comparison of q values for three peptide pairs matching three _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . the peptide pairs were from experiments in which either the leaf material was from plants and the root material was from plants or vice versa . we were able to identify integral proteins . major classes were transporters receptors proteins involved in _LOCATION_ trafficking and cell wall related proteins in good agreement with previous proteomic studies on plant _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . however only of these integral proteins were identified by unique peptides which also generated reliable spectra . only peptides unique to a protein can give information on the distribution of that protein whereas peptides shared between two or more members of a protein family may give additional information . this is well illustrated by our data for the members of the _PROTEIN_ subfamily belonging to the major intrinsic protein superfamily . peptide sequences for which reliable spectra could be obtained . the q value is a measure of the distribution of the peptide between root and leaf _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ a q value of means that the peptide is found in roots only in leaves only . sd is the standard deviation for the q value of the peptide based on all spectra containing the peptide pair for that specific peptide . number of _METHOD_ spectra containing reliable data for the peptide pair used to determine the q value . all these spectra have fulfilled all criteria for that specific peptide/protein including correct position of the protein on the _PROTEIN_ gel consistent elution of the peptide in the nano lc gradient and correct peptide molecular _METHOD_ as well as isotopic pattern . genevestigator data for mrna distribution between arabidopsis leaf rosettes and roots converted to a simple letter code l mrna found in leaves only r in roots only lr about equally distributed between leaves and roots lr _PROTEIN_ in leaves lr _PROTEIN_ in roots . mips constitute channels for small _PROTEIN_ molecules across _LOCATION_ . since the preferred substrate usually is water they are often referred to as aquaporins . the members of the aqp family found in arabidopsis may be divided into four subfamilies of which the _PROTEIN_ subfamily is the largest with members . as indicated by the name the _PROTEIN_ location of _PROTEIN_ is expected to be the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . _PROTEIN_ are crucial for water uptake by the root system and for _PROTEIN_ of water balance in the plant . peptides belonging to all _METHOD_ of the _PROTEIN_ subfamily were identified . _PROTEIN_ cluster into two subgroups _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ with a sequence identity of about between the subgroups and an identity within the subgroups of up to in arabidopsis . therefore all _PROTEIN_ amino acid sequences were aligned to identify unique peptides produced by trypsin cleavage . this was necessary since the program used could not be trusted in this respect but falsely identified unique peptides . based on these alignments nine _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ could be identified based on one or more unique peptides . _PROTEIN_ are major proteins of plant _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and band upon _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ both as monomers at about kda and as dimers at about kda . indeed peptides originating from _PROTEIN_ were identified in gel segments corresponding to both and kda as well as to the area in between . shows data for a peptide unique to _PROTEIN_ with an average q value of and for a peptide unique to _PROTEIN_ with an average q value of . _PROTEIN_ is thus present at higher abundance in root tissue compared to leaf tissue whereas the opposite is true for _PROTEIN_ . data are also shown for a peptide shared between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ with an average q value of . at equal amounts of the two _METHOD_ we would expect a q value of for this shared peptide . the q value of suggests that the overall abundance in the plant _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ of _PROTEIN_ is approximately four times higher than that of _PROTEIN_ . shows data for two peptides unique to _PROTEIN_ with q values of and respectively and three peptides unique to _PROTEIN_ with q values of and respectively showing _PROTEIN_ to be more distributed to leaf tissue and _PROTEIN_ to be more distributed to root tissue . also demonstrates the very good agreement between different data points for one specific peptide as well as for data obtained for different unique peptides of a protein . one peptide shared between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ was also detected with an average q value of showing _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ to be present in about equal amounts . similarly based on peptides shared between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ the ratios of abundance for these two pairs can be calculated to about . the proportions of _METHOD_ based on shared peptides agree well with published mrna data for three of the pairs _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ but not for the _PROTEIN_ pair . this is simplified version of the plot mentioned in the data processing part . a q values for two peptides unique to _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ respectively and for a peptide shared between these two _METHOD_ . b q values for two peptides unique to _PROTEIN_ and for three peptides unique to _PROTEIN_ and for a peptide shared between these two _METHOD_ . note that _PROTEIN_ with a monomer molecular _METHOD_ of about kda band upon _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ both as monomers and dimers and also in the area in between and kda . the molecular weights on the y axis are those indicated by the mw standards used in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ the scale is therefore not lineal . four of the _PROTEIN_ showed a tissue specific localization _PROTEIN_ and were only found in root tissue whereas _PROTEIN_ was only found in leaf tissue . a peptide _METHOD_ shared between all members of the _PROTEIN_ subfamily with a q value of suggests that the _PROTEIN_ subfamily is more abundant in leaf tissue than in root tissue . there is a fair agreement between our q values for the different _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and the mrna data in alexandersson et al . . these mrna data should be particularly relevant as a comparison since they were obtained with arabidopsis grown in a similar way to our plants and using a non commercial microarray with probes carefully designed to minimize overlap between _METHOD_ . however there is also a fair agreement with the mrna data in genevestigator . a good agreement with mrna levels should not always be expected not least because some _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ are also present in other _LOCATION_ than the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ e.g. due to internalization and recycling of _PROTEIN_ . in addition to the nine _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ another proteins were identified with unique peptides . these have all previously been suggested to be localized to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ except for the four unknowns for which there is less information . these includes _PROTEIN_ which has also been identified in previous proteomic studies of arabidopsis leaf and root _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . proteins are grouped according to function and all annotation is via the database tair . predicted transmembrane domains determined by phobius . number of unique peptides first identified by _METHOD_ and then detected in reliable spectra used for determination of the q value for that specific protein . all these spectra have fulfilled all criteria for that specific peptide/protein including correct position of the protein on the _PROTEIN_ gel consistent elution of the peptide in the nano lc gradient and correct peptide molecular _METHOD_ as well as isotopic pattern . the q value is a measure of the distribution of the peptide between root and leaf _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ a q value of means that the peptide is found in roots only in leaves only . sd is the standard deviation for the q value of the protein based on all unique peptides for that specific protein . number of _METHOD_ spectra containing reliable data for the peptide pair used to determine the q value . genevestigator data for mrna distribution between arabidopsis leaf rosettes and roots converted to a simple letter code l mrna found in leaves only r in roots only lr about equally distributed between leaves and roots lr _PROTEIN_ in leaves lr _PROTEIN_ in roots . the three q values for _PROTEIN_ were obtained with two unique peptides found in three neighboring segments of the _PROTEIN_ gel . thirteen transporters were identified with unique peptides the nine _PROTEIN_ discussed above one _PROTEIN_ one _PROTEIN_ binding cassette transporter one oligopeptide transporter and one isoform of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ h _PROTEIN_ family . the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ h _PROTEIN_ constitutes several percent of total _LOCATION_ protein and creates the h and electrical gradient across the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ which drives secondary active transport . the h _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis is encoded by a gene family with members producing _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ with an amino acid sequence identity of to . eleven aha peptides were identified however only one of these was unique and belongs to _PROTEIN_ . the q value of this peptide was and the q values for the other peptides shared between two to eight of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ ranged between and with a mean value of . this suggests that the h _PROTEIN_ family as a whole is about equally _PROTEIN_ in leaves and roots in agreement with the immunostaining in . the abc transporter identified with three unique peptides was the highly _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ which is known to be highly _PROTEIN_ and confers resistance to a number of pathogens in particular of the leaf and is suggested to extrude compounds toxic to the pathogens at the invasion site . however _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ to transport a broad range of compounds including heavy metal ions such as and and is more abundant in shoots than in roots of week old arabidopsis seedlings as demonstrated by immunostaining which is in good agreement with our q value of . five proteins involved in vesicle transport at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ were identified with q values suggesting that they all are _PROTEIN_ in both leaves and roots in agreement with literature data although our data for _PROTEIN_ a qc snare are more complex . we detected _PROTEIN_ with two unique peptides in three neighboring segments of the gel with different q values for each segment suggesting the presence of three variants of the protein migrating to slightly different positions in the gel . this could be due to different posttranslational modifications and/or to _PROTEIN_ of different splice variants . creating some degree of tissue specificity for the ubiquitously _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ is located in both the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and is _PROTEIN_ in all vegetative tissues as demonstrated by both staining with _PROTEIN_ and immunostaining . the lotus japonicus _PROTEIN_ homolog was recently implicated in symbiotic nitrogen fixation and shown to be _PROTEIN_ in both shoots roots and nodules . a ubiquitous _PROTEIN_ is typical for the snare proteins in arabidopsis as shown by reversed transcription pcr and confirmed for the qa snares _PROTEIN_ and using _METHOD_ fusion proteins . a ubiquitous _PROTEIN_ of plant snares is supported by a recent proteomic study on _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ isolated from leaves xylem and phloem from poplar trees in the poplar study none of the identified snares was tissue specific and of the snares were detected in all three tissues investigated . _PROTEIN_ a synaptotagmin is involved in _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ repair where resealing of _LOCATION_ disruptions requires exocytotic addition of internal _LOCATION_ and is found in all tissues as shown by gus staining . of the eight proteins classified as cell wall related previous organ/tissue localizations exist for both of the fasciclin like arabinogalactan proteins _PROTEIN_ and for one of the copper proteins _PROTEIN_ and for all three glycerophosphodiester phosphodiesterases _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ have been suggested to affect cellulose deposition and to be involved in responses to abiotic stress . rna gel blots suggest that _PROTEIN_ is about equally _PROTEIN_ in leaves and roots of day old arabidopsis seedlings which is in direct contradiction to our data which suggest _PROTEIN_ to be _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in leaves . however a compilation of _PROTEIN_ sequence tag data suggests that _PROTEIN_ has a higher _PROTEIN_ in above ground organs than in roots and that the opposite is true for _PROTEIN_ which agrees better with our q values of and for _PROTEIN_ and respectively . _PROTEIN_ is suggested to have a role in cell wall expansion and immunostaining indicates that it is present in both roots and leaves particularly in expanding tissues in fair agreement with our data . _PROTEIN_ and its homologs _PROTEIN_ and are thought to be involved in primary cell wall organization . using rt pcr _PROTEIN_ was found to be _PROTEIN_ in both roots and leaves of week old arabidopsis seedlings whereas _PROTEIN_ showed _PROTEIN_ in roots only and _PROTEIN_ in leaves only . however using gus staining of promoter activity in day old seedlings contradictory results were obtained for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was found to be _PROTEIN_ in roots only _PROTEIN_ in both roots and leaves and _PROTEIN_ as also indicated by rt pcr in leaves only all in very good agreement with our data . eleven proteins related to signal transduction and stress responses were identified of which only three _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ have previously been localized to a tissue or organ in arabidopsis . the phosphoinositide specific phospholipase c _PROTEIN_ which produces the two second messengers inositol trisphosphate and diacylglycerol is _PROTEIN_ about equally in roots and leaves of to week old arabidopsis seedlings according to rna blots _PROTEIN_ in good agreement with our q value of . _PROTEIN_ catalyzes an early step in the biosynthesis of the signal molecule brassinosteroid . there are no localization data for the arabidopsis protein but the single maize homolog was shown to be _PROTEIN_ in all tissues examined with a relatively high _PROTEIN_ in roots particularly in young actively developing roots _PROTEIN_ which compares well with our q value of . the progesterone binding protein _METHOD_ _LOCATION_ is _PROTEIN_ in rosette leaves of arabidopsis as determined with rna blots however roots were not investigated . we found _METHOD_ about equally distributed between roots and leaves . the _PROTEIN_ gene belongs to a family of _PROTEIN_ like genes that are homologs of the nonrace specific disease resistance _PROTEIN_ and harpin induced genes in nicotiana tabacum . overexpression of the _PROTEIN_ protein in arabidopsis correlates with increased resistance to the pathogen pseudomonas syringae and the authors demonstrate _PROTEIN_ in leaves by immunoblotting . roots were not investigated however but we find the protein in leaves only . the four proteins with unknown molecular functions were all _PROTEIN_ found in roots and may be involved in stress responses . the _PROTEIN_ protein has a traf _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ motif . traf proteins in mammals link cell surface receptors to intracellular signaling pathways in innate immune responses . the plant innate immune system is well developed and numerous receptors _PROTEIN_ are found in _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . traf domain containing genes were also recently linked to virus infection in arabidopsis by association mapping . the other three unknowns are all members of the same plant specific uncharacterized protein family and have molecular _METHOD_ of about kda . genome wide analysis of gene _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis have associated members of this protein family with responses to both abiotic and biotic stress .
wild type arabidopsis thaliana ecotype columbia were grown hydroponically . seeds were surface sterilized in ethanol followed by bleach tween before germinated and grown on cm plates with murashige and skoog mineral salts medium _METHOD_ supplemented with bacto agar for weeks . in the enriched medium the normal nitrogen sources were exchanged for and . after weeks the seedlings were transferred from the gel plates to round plastic discs with two holes in the middle where two plants were placed . the discs were placed on top of plastic petri dishes containing ml medium keeping the leaves on top of the disc and the roots beneath the medium surface . and plants were grown next to each other in a small greenhouse placed in a room at for a h day/night period . when plants were weeks old they were harvested at nine o'clock in the morning and divided into green leaf rosette and root tissue samples . preparations of leaf and root _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ from and plants were then run in parallel as described below . all steps in the preparation procedure were performed at or on ice . ten g of fresh plant material either leaf or root tissue was homogenized with a knife blender in ml homogenization buffer m sucrose mm mops koh ph mm edta casein hydrolysate protease inhibitor cocktail including polyvinylpolypyrrolidone mm ascorbate and mm dithiothreitol added immediately before use . the homogenate was filtered through a nylon mesh and phenylmethanesulphonylfluoride was added to a final concentration of mm . the filtrate was centrifuged at g for min the pellet was discarded and the supernatant was centrifuged at g for min . the supernatant containing soluble proteins was saved and the microsomal pellet was resuspended in ml resuspension buffer m sucrose mm k phosphate ph mm edta and mm dtt freshly added . to produce an aqueous polymer two phase system with a final weight of g the resuspended pellet was added to a g phase mixture producing a dextran polyethylene glycol m sucrose mm k phosphate ph mm kcl phase system . further purification of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ using the aqueous polymer two phase system was performed according to larsson et al . . the final upper phase highly enriched in _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ was diluted two fold with m sucrose mm k phosphate ph mm edta before centrifugation at g for h. the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ pellet was resuspended in resuspension buffer . protein concentration was determined according to bradford with bovine serum albumin as a standard . samples were solubilized at room temperature in standard sample buffer and polypeptides were separated by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ according to laemmli . gels were either stained with colloidal _METHOD_ or polypeptides were electrophoretically transferred to an immobilon polyvinylidene difluoride transfer _LOCATION_ for immunostaining . after blocking in bsa in phosphate buffered saline _PROTEIN_ overnight the blots were incubated with one of the following rabbit polyclonal antisera diluted in _PROTEIN_ anti _PROTEIN_ an antiserum raised against a peptide corresponding to a sequence of the _PROTEIN_ protein _METHOD_ of arabidopsis . anti _PROTEIN_ an antiserum raised against a peptide corresponding to a widely conserved sequence of the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit ii . anti h _PROTEIN_ an antiserum raised against a polypeptide corresponding to amino acids to of the c terminus of the arabidopsis h _PROTEIN_ isoform _PROTEIN_ and a kind gift from professor r. serrano . the horseradish peroxidase conjugated secondary antibody was visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence _METHOD_ . arabidopsis microsomal fractions obtained from leaves and roots respectively were subjected to aqueous two phase partitioning to produce _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ fractions . polypeptides were separated by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ transferred to a blotting _LOCATION_ and immunostained with antisera directed against the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ h _PROTEIN_ subunit ii of the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase and light harvesting complex ii of the chloroplast _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . molecular weights are indicated to the left . note that the antiserum against coxii also produced a band at a slightly higher molecular weight than the expected kda . each lane on the _PROTEIN_ gel was divided into segments for trypsin digestion . the gel segments were placed in well plates and washed twice in mm ammonium bicarbonate ethanol buffer to remove the _METHOD_ staining . after dehydration in ethanol the gel pieces were subjected to reduction and alkylation by adding of mm dtt and of mm iodoacetamide with a second dehydration step in between . the gel pieces were washed and dehydrated once again before of digestion buffer was added . finally of mm was added and the samples were digested overnight at . peptides were extracted by adding of trifluoroacetic acid and incubation for h. the supernatant was collected and pooled with the overnight digestion solution . peptides from the in situ digestion were separated by reversed phase nano lc using a series nanoflow lc system with mobile phase buffers a and b . eight of the peptide extract was loaded on to a precolumn and then separated on a separation column at a flow rate of . fractions were collected on a stainless steel maldi target using the series lc micro collection spotting system . when collecting fractions peptides are eluted with the following elution profile to min b to min b to min to b to min b to min b . fraction collection was performed from min to min in min intervals . mixed and fractions contain almost double the amount of peptides . to reduce sample complexity these samples were collected in fractions with the following elution profile to min b to min b to min to b to min to b to min b to min b . fraction collection was performed from min to min in min intervals . _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ spectra were acquired on a maldi tof/tof _METHOD_ spectrometer _METHOD_ in positive reflector mode . _PROTEIN_ solution containing mg/ml cyano hydroxy cinnamic acid acetonitrile tfa and mm citric acid was added onto the dried peptide sample eluted from the lc . for identification of _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ proteins in leaf and root tissues samples were lc fractionated on spots and _METHOD_ spectra were recorded automatically before _METHOD_ spectra were acquired for the ten most intense ions in each _METHOD_ spectrum . the jobwide interpretation function in the peak explorer software was used to select the precursor ions where the minimum signal to noise value for selection was set to and the spot to spot difference between precursor _METHOD_ to ppm . known trypsin autodigestion peptides and keratin peptides were excluded . mixed and samples lc fractionated on spots were recorded automatically in _METHOD_ mode . totally to shots were collected per spectrum to achieve good ion statistics . all _METHOD_ spectra were internally calibrated using three standard peptides angiotensin ii m/z neurotensin m/z and acth m/z . gps explorer software an in house mascot search engine _PROTEIN_ and the tair protein database were used for protein identifications in the leaf and root fractions using the acquired _METHOD_ data . the settings used for the database search were trypsin specific digestion digestion with one missed cleavage site peptide _METHOD_ tolerance set to ppm fragment ion _METHOD_ tolerance set to da _PROTEIN_ set as fixed modification . to _PROTEIN_ the protein as identified a confidence level of on the protein level was used . our in house developed software allows for automated processing of the large _METHOD_ data sets obtained after metabolic labeling of proteins . the software can for instance be used to determine the relative abundance of proteins in different samples labeled with isotopes . in the present work proteins were first identified from leaf and root samples with one single isotopic distribution by searching the tair protein database . then peptide information from the identified proteins was used for scanning through _METHOD_ data from samples containing proteins with different isotopic distributions . _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ fractions were prepared from leaf and root tissue respectively obtained from intact arabidopsis plants hydroponically grown either on a or a medium . left panel proteins were separated by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and protein bands were excised for proteolysis . peptides were separated by reversed phase nano liquid chromatography and analyzed by maldi tof _METHOD_ for peptide and protein identification and construction of a peptide library . right panel leaf and root _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ preparations were combined at a protein ratio and proteins were separated by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . protein bands were excised digested and peptides were separated by rp nano lc and analyzed by maldi _METHOD_ . finally the relative abundance of individual proteins in leaf and root _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ was determined from the signal intensities of the peptide pairs . briefly the program reads a file with information about each identified protein and peptide derived from them and peak list files with _METHOD_ data which contain the signal intensity and corresponding _METHOD_ for each detected signal . various parameters for the program are specified in a settings panel which allows to adjust _METHOD_ tolerance isotopic pattern correlation etc . the program reads the peptide sequences for each protein identified in the tair database search and calculates the theoretical _METHOD_ for the peptides based on the atomic composition of the peptides amino acids . the program also generates theoretical isotope distributions for each peptide based on the peptide atomic composition and data _PROTEIN_ the natural occurrence of isotopes . it uses this information to compare the theoretical isotopic distributions with the experimental ones to get a quality measurement of the experimental data . theoretical isotope distributions are calculated for naturally occurring peptides as well as labelled peptides . based on the information about the theoretical _METHOD_ of the peptides the program then searches all the peak lists for signals from these peptide _METHOD_ and extracts signal data in the relevant m/z window for further processing . comparisons of intensity ratios for neighboring isotope signals in an experimentally obtained envelope with the corresponding intensity ratios for a theoretical envelope assuming labeling efficiency . left panel theoretical isotope pattern for the peptide dvegpegfqtr from the aquaporin _PROTEIN_ . right panel experimental isotope pattern for the same peptide . the difference from the theoretical ratio was calculated for each pair of signals and only isotopic envelopes that did not differ more than the threshold values preset in the settings file of the processing software were used for further analysis . results are printed to a _PROTEIN_ output folder in which subfolders for each protein are generated . the subfolders are labelled with the accession number of the protein for which information they contain . each of the protein subfolders contains result files for all of the peptides that have been matched to this protein . for each peptide the program produces a result file containing quantitative information about each peptide pair found in the data set . for each peptide pair signals in the relevant m/z window are extracted from all peak lists and are shown in the results file for this peptide . the result is presented as the sum of the signals from the heavy isotope peptide divided by the sum of all signals of the light and heavy peptide . each protein folder containing data on peptide results also includes a q value plot . for each protein good quality q values for every peptide pair from all peak lists are shown as a dot in the q value plot which makes it possible to get an overview of the q value results for this protein . a soluble leaf protein extracts from plants grown in and medium respectively were mixed at different ratios and subjected to _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . two bands containing rubisco large subunit and fructose bisphosphate aldolase _PROTEIN_ were excised from each lane and processed as described in . b experimental data for one of the _PROTEIN_ peptides . c average q values for peptides _PROTEIN_ are summarized and compared to the theoretical values . the relative abundance of and labeled peptides is defined as the fraction
