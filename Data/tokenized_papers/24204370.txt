s nitrosoglutathione reductase _PROTEIN_ is believed to modulate effects of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species through catabolism of s nitrosoglutathione . we combined bioinformatics of plant _PROTEIN_ genes localization of _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis thaliana and microarray analysis of a _PROTEIN_ null mutant to gain insights into the function and regulation of this critical enzyme in nitric oxide homeostasis . _PROTEIN_ encoding genes are known to have high homology across diverse eukaryotic taxa but contributions of specific conserved residues have not been assessed . with bioinformatics and structural modeling we show that plant _PROTEIN_ likely localize to the _LOCATION_ contain conserved solvent accessible cysteines and tend to be encoded by a single gene . arabidopsis thaliana homozygous for _PROTEIN_ loss of function alleles exhibited defects in stem and trichome branching and complementation with green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ under control of the native promoter quantitatively rescued these phenotypes . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ showed _METHOD_ throughout arabidopsis seedlings consistent with ubiquitous _PROTEIN_ of the protein but with especially high _METHOD_ in the root tip apical meristem and flowers . at the cellular level we observed _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ with exclusion from the nucleolus . microarray analysis identified up and down regulated genes in a _PROTEIN_ null mutant compared to wild type . six members of the plant specific roxy glutaredoxins and three bhlh transcription _PROTEIN_ involved in iron homeostasis were strongly upregulated supporting a role for _PROTEIN_ in redox and iron metabolism . one third of downregulated genes are linked to pathogen resistance providing further basis for the reported pathogen sensitivity of _PROTEIN_ null mutants . together these findings indicate _PROTEIN_ regulates multiple developmental and metabolic _METHOD_ in plants and offer insight into putative routes of post translational _PROTEIN_ regulation .
to identify potentially novel shared motifs in plant _PROTEIN_ we employed the tblastn _METHOD_ of phytozome _PROTEIN_ and ncbi gene _PROTEIN_ omnibus to search for _PROTEIN_ sequences supported by transcriptional data . eighteen unique type iii _PROTEIN_ encoding cdnas were obtained from a variety of monocots dicots mosses and protists . residues near the dimer interface of tomato _PROTEIN_ whose mutation compromises thermotolerance in dark grown arabidopsis seedlings are notably found in all plant sequences while a glycine that when mutated to aspartate diminishes _PROTEIN_ activity but confers enhanced paraquat resistance is present in all but two algae . substrate and nadh enclosing clefts are identical or contain conservative substitutions among moss and algal orthologs . structural and catalytic zinc coordinating residues and substrate binding amino acids as reported by et al . are identical in all but two predicted proteins which contain a single lysine to arginine conservative substitution . _PROTEIN_ is remarkably cysteine rich with a mole percent cysteine of for the arabidopsis protein compared to the average for all proteins in the uniprotkb database . because cysteines can serve as key post translational regulatory sites being modified by nitrosation glutathionylation or reversible oxidation we analyzed the conservation of the nine extra non zinc coordinating cysteine residues in arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ . four are in all the transcript supported plant sequences two are substituted in one two are substituted in two and one differs in four _METHOD_ yielding an overall conservation of . if additional plant genes are considered for which est support is lacking ex zinc cysteine conservation is still . thus the position and frequency of ex zinc cysteines are highly conserved in plant _PROTEIN_ . we also examined the position of ex zinc cysteines in the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ structure and found that three were solvent accessible two of and cys positionally conserved even in the human sequence . the structures of _PROTEIN_ from human and tomato showed similar solvent exposure of the homologous ex zinc cysteines suggesting these three residues may have conserved functions in regulating _PROTEIN_ activity . of nine positionally conserved ex zinc cysteines in _PROTEIN_ three are solvent accessible . three orientations of a monomer of the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ dimer are shown with solvent accessible surface in yellow . solvent accessible ex zinc cysteines are indicated in blue and the dimer interface in gray . images were made in pymol . encoded by a single gene arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ consists of nicotinamide cofactor binding and catalytic domains and has two primary enzymatic reductase and _PROTEIN_ dehydrogenase _PROTEIN_ . interestingly although _PROTEIN_ is found primarily as a single copy gene in most other examined plant species _METHOD_ the dicots populus trichocarpa and gossypium raimondii and the moss physcomitrella patens are predicted to have two _PROTEIN_ . although not yet supported by transcript data gene families are also predicted in phaseolus vulgaris glycine max and malus domestica . moreover in phylogenetic trees calculated by the average distance method with evolview paralogs within the same species were more similar to one another than to orthologs in other species . thus not only do most plant genomes encode one copy of _PROTEIN_ but duplication of _PROTEIN_ encoding genes has occurred recently and sporadically among plant species . extended n termini which could facilitate organelle targeting are present in predicted _PROTEIN_ sequences from prunus persica and physcomitrella . therefore the predotar program was used to search for putative endomembrane _LOCATION_ and mitochondrial targeting peptides in all _PROTEIN_ . of input sequences only one physcomitrella paralog was predicted to have a mitochondrial targeting peptide . analysis with mitoprot _PROTEIN_ achieved similar results . intriguingly intragenic regions of _PROTEIN_ from arabidopsis rice and selaginella moellendorfii included cryptic splice sites that could give rise to putative mitochondrial targeting peptides but intragenic regions from tomato potato medicago and o. lucimarinus did not . these results suggest _PROTEIN_ is a _LOCATION_ enzyme in most plants . we also noted predicted n and c terminal extensions in non transcript supported orthologs from two strains of micromonas pusilla and in apple that are too long to be signaling peptides . blast searches indicated m. pusilla extensions were formylglutathione hydrolase _PROTEIN_ domains which catalyze the decomposition of s formylglutathione _PROTEIN_ to gsh and formate . _PROTEIN_ are predicted in many green plants albeit as separate gene products . _PROTEIN_ is the product of the _PROTEIN_ dehydrogenase activity of _PROTEIN_ and is a key intermediate in formaldehyde detoxification . this observation suggests that at least in the case of m. pusilla strains no and formaldehyde metabolism are intimately linked . the c terminus of an apple _PROTEIN_ comprises a dopa dioxygenase an enzyme in the biosynthesis of phenylpropanoid derived betalain pigments that aid in plant defense _PROTEIN_ but transcriptional support has not been obtained for this fusion . to determine the major sites of _PROTEIN_ function we created a translational fusion of gpf at the c terminus of _PROTEIN_ driven by native promoter sequence and transformed this construct into the _PROTEIN_ null mutant _PROTEIN_ . we carried forward three homozygous transgenic lines that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . mutation of _PROTEIN_ results in reduced plant height and an increased number of inflorescences . we quantified these differences in mature plants and found that while _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ null mutants and corresponding wild types produce a similar number of first order inflorescence _METHOD_ mutants produce two fold more second order branches and often produce third order branches which are not observed in wild type plants . all three complemented lines showed quantitative restoration of wild type height and branching patterns indicating that the _METHOD_ fusion did not compromise _PROTEIN_ function . we further observed reduced trichome branching in _PROTEIN_ null plants a previously unreported phenotype . mutants primarily produced trichomes with only two branches rather than the three or four typical of wild type . of _PROTEIN_ trichomes were two branched compared to virtually zero in col and similar differences were detected between ws and _PROTEIN_ . the absolute number of trichomes was marginally higher in ws leaves compared with those of _PROTEIN_ in agreement with holzmeister et al . _PROTEIN_ while trichome abundance did not differ between col and _PROTEIN_ indicating the difference in trichome number must be due to a modifying gene present only in the ws background . quantitation of trichome branching in the complemented lines showed that the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein restored branching to wild type levels . _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ under its own promoter rescues multiple aspects of the _PROTEIN_ null phenotype . immunoblots of leaf protein extracts probed with anti arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ antibodies or anti _LOCATION_ gapdh blots . rubisco

genetic backgrounds with primary inflorescence overlaid in red . bar cm . shorter plant height and inflorescence branching order are rescued to wild type levels in and . trichomes with reduced branching are more numerous in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ rosette leaves than in respective wild type backgrounds . _LOCATION_ bars _PROTEIN_ left to right trichomes from _PROTEIN_ col col. bar mm . red arrows indicate trichome branches . trichome branching is rescued to wild type levels in and . based on complementation of _PROTEIN_ phenotypes the _METHOD_ fusion seemed suitable to assess _PROTEIN_ localization . whole seedlings at the cotyledon stage and flower stage were imaged to observe the tissue and subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . _METHOD_ was observed throughout seedling and floral structures which correlates with gene _PROTEIN_ data in public databases . the seedling apical meristem and root tip exhibited notably intense _METHOD_ while cotyledon hypocotyl root and _PROTEIN_ vascular tissue signals were highest . detailed observation of sections through the root tip show distribution in all root cell types with diffuse _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ localization but dramatic exclusion from the nucleolus . this is also evident in the elongating zone of the root although nucleoli are considerably smaller in these cells . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ could also be detected in anther filaments ovary stigma and _PROTEIN_ of stage flowers and was particularly enriched in pollen and seed . _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ in various organs and developmental stages in arabidopsis . localization of _PROTEIN_ was observed in plants transformed with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in the _PROTEIN_ background . all plants were homozygous for the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgene with the exception of those used for images in . whole seedling . cotyledon . flower stage . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ distribution and localization in root tip cells in optical cross section through the middle of the root . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ localization in root epidermal cells . optical cross section of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ localization in root cortex cells at two different magnifications . arrowheads nucleolus . _PROTEIN_ propidium iodide staining dic differential interference contrast microscopy . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ localization in the root elongation zone . bar . localization of

not _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ due to segregation of the transgene in the heterozygote . bar or . to assess global changes in the transcriptome due to _PROTEIN_ absence we performed microarray analysis on week leaves of _PROTEIN_ plants grown on a h light cycle since the leaves of col and _PROTEIN_ plants are most morphologically comparable at this age . imposing stringent criteria of fold changes with p _PROTEIN_ we found and transcripts up and downregulated respectively in _PROTEIN_ compared to col . a complete list of transcripts is provided in supp . table categorized by pathway as curated in mapman . this list was used to test for enriched categories of regulated genes . one group of enriched genes was the stress response category . of genes in this category were downregulated biotic stress genes including pathogenesis related protein _PROTEIN_ consistent with data from feechan et al . _PROTEIN_ four potential pathogen receptors _PROTEIN_ and other predicted herbivore and pathogen defense proteins . of two upregulated stress category genes the defensin protein _PROTEIN_ was also reported to be upregulated in _PROTEIN_ antisense plants _PROTEIN_ . changes in stress responsive transcripts in _PROTEIN_ vs. wild type . p listed as . these results are consistent with the involvement of no in pathogen responses and prompted us to employ the arabidopsis _METHOD_ browser and tair gene annotations to determine if other pathogen response linked genes including those in the not assigned category were also differentially regulated in _PROTEIN_ . the _METHOD_ data include response to the oomycete phytophthora infestans the bacterium pseudomonas syringae the fungi botrytis cinerea and _LOCATION_ orontii as well as induction by non host bacteria and several elicitors . as highlighted in supp . table additional genes that can be linked to pathogen response are down regulated _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ making a total of of downregulated genes linked to pathogen response . in contrast only additional upregulated genes can be linked to pathogen response . since of arabidopsis genes are pathogen defense related _PROTEIN_ we conclude the absence of _PROTEIN_ disproportionately downregulates pathogen response genes . given the significant interplay between gsno levels and gsh controlled redox homeostasis it was of interest that genes in the redox category were also enriched . intriguingly six _LOCATION_ roxy class glutaredoxins _PROTEIN_ and an atypical chloroplast localized thioredoxin were upregulated in _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ and trxs are small oxidoreductases that regulate the thiol redox state of other proteins . four of the six up regulated _PROTEIN_ genes are closely linked on chromosome and share identity while two others on chromosomes and are and identical to the chromosome genes respectively and identical to each other . all six _PROTEIN_ belong to a plant specific _PROTEIN_ family containing a monocysteine active site . thus these _PROTEIN_ proteins likely act as monothiol _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . one _LOCATION_ monothiol roxy _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ which is divergent from the upregulated genes is downregulated in _PROTEIN_ . examination of publically available _PROTEIN_ patterns of these regulated roxy genes indicates that during normal plant growth the _PROTEIN_ upregulated roxy genes have low transcript levels in _METHOD_ senescing leaves and the shoot apex while _PROTEIN_ shows the opposite pattern . thus these _PROTEIN_ proteins are likely to serve different functions . currently the redox targets of these _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ and the unusual chloroplast trx are unknown but increased _PROTEIN_ of the corresponding genes indicates that mutation of _PROTEIN_ alters redox homeostasis and potentially the targets of these oxidoreductases . changes in redox transcripts in _PROTEIN_ vs. wild type . p listed as . another enriched category of genes that presents a consistent picture of changes in the _PROTEIN_ mutant is the signaling category in which of genes are down regulated and half of the downregulated genes are involved in calcium signaling including multiple calmodulins calmodulin like proteins and calreticulins . the single upregulated gene in this category is _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ which also has sequence similarity to calmodulin . these data provide a direct link of gsno to calcium signaling . although transcription was not a specifically enriched category consideration of regulated transcription _PROTEIN_ shows that three of the most highly upregulated genes encode bhlh proteins involved in iron deficiency responses _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . the potential targets of these transcription _PROTEIN_ in leaves are unknown although in roots they can activate genes required for iron uptake . among downregulated genes in the transcription category it is notable that there are three _PROTEIN_ transcription _PROTEIN_ which are involved in ethylene responses including the most strongly downregulated gene in this category tiny _PROTEIN_ .
