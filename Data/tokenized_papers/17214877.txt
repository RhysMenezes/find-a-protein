the potential of transgenic plants for cost effective production of pharmaceutical molecules is now becoming apparent . plants have the advantage over established fermentation _METHOD_ to circumvent the risk of pathogen contamination to be amenable to large scaling up and to necessitate only established farming procedures . chloroplasts have proven a useful cellular compartment for protein accumulation owing to their large size and number as well as the possibility for organellar transformation . they therefore represent the targeting destination of choice for recombinant proteins in leaf crops such as tobacco . extraction and purification of recombinant proteins from leaf material contribute to a large extent to the production costs . developing new strategies facilitating these processes is therefore necessary . here we evaluated plastoglobule lipoprotein particles as a new subchloroplastic destination for recombinant proteins . the yellow _METHOD_ protein as a trackable cargo was targeted to _LOCATION_ when fused to plastoglobulin _PROTEIN_ as the carrier . similar to adipocyte differentiation related protein in animal cells most of the protein sequence of _PROTEIN_ was necessary for targeting to lipid bodies . the recombinant protein was efficiently enriched in _LOCATION_ isolated by simple flotation centrifugation . the viability of plants overproducing the recombinant protein was not affected indicating that plastoglobule targeting did not significantly impair photosynthesis or sugar metabolism . our data identify _LOCATION_ as a new targeting destination for recombinant protein in leaf crops . the wide spread presence of _LOCATION_ and plastoglobulins in crop species promises applications comparable to those of transgenic oilbody oleosin technology in molecular farming .
in the absence of data on the sequence requirement for plastoglobule targeting we designed a series of c terminal _METHOD_ fusion constructs that removed portions of _PROTEIN_ coding sequence . _PROTEIN_ is a representative member of the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ fibrillin family . three domains with somewhat higher hydrophobic scores can be recognised in the kyte and doolittle hydropathy plot of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . these domains comprise residues and . furthermore any domain responsible for targeting or anchoring plastoglobulins to _LOCATION_ may be conserved among the different members of the _PROTEIN_ fibrillin family . sequence alignments revealed that a central domain in _PROTEIN_ is conserved among the _PROTEIN_ fibrillin family . both homology and hydropathic criteria were therefore taken into account for the choice of the deletion constructs . the shortest construct _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ only comprised residues in addition to the predicted transit peptide and was designed as a stromal control . the second construct comprising the amino acids _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ contained the domain as well as the conserved central domain . the construct _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ additionally included the motif . the fourth construct _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ comprised and motifs as well as the conserved domain . an additional n terminal deletion construct _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ lacking residues contained the and motifs but not and the central domain . as shown in fig . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ gave diffuse signals broadly overlapping with the _METHOD_ of the chlorophyll . in several chloroplasts however peak _METHOD_ and chlorophyll _METHOD_ did not overlap suggesting that both fusion proteins localised in the stroma . in contrast when _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ construct was _PROTEIN_ in protoplasts the fusion protein localised to small punctate structures similarly to the full length protein . a distinct pattern was observed with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ constructs . fewer and larger _METHOD_ spots were observed in chloroplasts suggesting mistargeting or protein aggregation . the same observation was made with constructs comprising residues or of _PROTEIN_ . to verify the integrity of each _METHOD_ fusion protein transformed protoplasts were analysed by western blotting using an anti _METHOD_ serum . with the exception of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ which could not be detected due to low _PROTEIN_ levels all _METHOD_ fusion proteins migrated at the expected _METHOD_ . mistargeting of _PROTEIN_ deletion constructs imply that the corresponding fusion proteins do not colocalise with full length _PROTEIN_ . we therefore cotransformed protoplasts with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ deletion constructs fused to _METHOD_ . as revealed in merged _METHOD_ images _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ signals did not overlap in protoplasts _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . in contrast _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ colocalised indicating that the short c terminal hydrophilic part of the protein is dispensable for targeting . the strong punctate signals observed in protoplasts _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were not labelled with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ confirming mistargeting and/or aggregation of the truncated protein . the results obtained with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ deletion constructs suggested that most of the protein sequence is required for plastoglobule targeting . to address the potential of plastoglobule targeting for protein purification arabidopsis plants were transformed with the coding sequence of _METHOD_ replacing the stop codon in the genomic sequence of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . the chimeric coding sequence was placed under the control of _PROTEIN_ promoter and terminator in order to minimise the risk of gene silencing . eleven primary transformants were isolated and homozygous lines containing a single insertion locus were selected by segregation analysis . _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in these lines was analyzed using both western blotting and _METHOD_ microscopy . a wide range of transgene _PROTEIN_ levels was observed possibly reflecting positional effects of the t dna insertions _PROTEIN_ . a double band was detected in the transgenic plant extracts the upper band possibly reflecting partial cleavage of the chloroplast targeting sequence . the line accumulating the highest level of recombinant protein was chosen for subsequent analysis . the concentration of recombinant protein in crude extracts was quantified by comparing immunoblot signals with serial dilutions of purified _METHOD_ produced in escherichia coli . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was calculated to account for approximately of total leaf proteins . strongest _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was detected in leaves and roots showed comparably lower _METHOD_ signals consistent with the _PROTEIN_ pattern of _PROTEIN_ determined by microarray analysis _PROTEIN_ . a detailed picture of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signals was obtained by confocal microscopy analysis of transgenic leaves . punctate signals were observed in epidermal as well as in mesophyll cells . _METHOD_ patterns were similar to those observed in protoplasts transiently _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ indicating targeting of the _METHOD_ cargo to _LOCATION_ in planta . transgenic plants accumulating _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were indistinguishable from the wild type when grown in short or long day conditions . the germination rate of transgenic seeds was equal to wild type . no difference in fresh weight was observed between wild type and transgenic plants indicating that growth was not altered in plants overexpressing _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . in sub optimal photosynthetic conditions the photosystem ii is subject to photoinhibition characterised by a _PROTEIN_ of maximum ps ii quantum efficiency _PROTEIN_ . fluorometry revealed similar fv/fm _METHOD_ values in transgenic vs. wild type leaves ruling out major inhibitory effects of plastoglobule targeting on photosynthesis . _LOCATION_ were isolated from chloroplast _LOCATION_ prepared from transgenic leaves using sucrose density gradient flotation centrifugation . fractions collected from the density gradient were analyzed by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ followed by western blotting . the blots were probed with anti _PROTEIN_ anti and anti cab antibodies as plastoglobule envelope and _LOCATION_ markers respectively . the results demonstrated the separation of _LOCATION_ from envelope and _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ detected by anti _METHOD_ antibodies co distributed with _PROTEIN_ . moreover globular _METHOD_ structures were highly abundant in low density fractions demonstrating targeting of the recombinant protein to _LOCATION_ . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ analysis of the low density fractions revealed a prominent band with an apparent _METHOD_ of kda consistent with the predicted _METHOD_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . this band was recognized by anti _METHOD_ antibodies . similar to immunodetection on total leaf extracts an additional faint band migrating at kda was also recognized by the antibody . analysis by tandem _METHOD_ _METHOD_ confirmed that both bands contained _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . the upper band may reflect partial cleavage of the chloroplast targeting sequence or post translational modifications of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . however _METHOD_ spectrometric analysis of tryptic peptides derived from the two protein bands yielded no additional evidence with _PROTEIN_ to the two possibilities . to estimate the enrichment _PROTEIN_ resulting from the gradient flotation the amount of recombinant protein in the sucrose step was determined by comparing immunoblot signals with a dilution series of purified _METHOD_ . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ accounted for about of the protein content . based on this and the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ concentration in leaves the gradient flotation step had lead to an approximately fold enrichment of the recombinant protein . to determine whether proteins similar to _PROTEIN_ are present in cultivated plant species sequence homology searches were performed . as shown in fig . protein sequences with significant blast hits were found in monocots and in a broad range of dicot taxa . pairwise comparisons performed with the matgat software _PROTEIN_ revealed that the protein sequences shown in fig . were at least similar . arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ shared for example similarity and identity with the protein sequence deduced from a tobacco est assembly . these data indicate that proteins from the _PROTEIN_ family are highly conserved in the plant kingdom .
the complete coding sequence of _PROTEIN_ excluding the stop codon was amplified by pcr from a cdna clones obtained from the arabidopsis biological resource center _PROTEIN_ . forward _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and reverse _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ primers included ncoi sites . the pcr product was ligated in the ncoi site of either or _PROTEIN_ resulting in c terminal _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ fusions respectively under the control of the camv promoter and the nos terminator . partial _PROTEIN_ sequences were amplified from _PROTEIN_ using a forward primer containing a xbai site _PROTEIN_ and the following reverse primers including ncoi sites cat gcc atg gca acc _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ ctg cat _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ c _PROTEIN_ cat gcc atg gca ctc cat cta _PROTEIN_ tca _PROTEIN_ taa gg _PROTEIN_ cat gcc atg gca tct tta _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ tcc a _PROTEIN_ cat gcc atg gct tcc acc ctc _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ ac _PROTEIN_ . the corresponding pcr products were ligated into the xbai and ncoi sites of or _PROTEIN_ yielding _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ fusions respectively . to obtain the deletion construct _PROTEIN_ a c terminal fragment of _PROTEIN_ was amplified from _PROTEIN_ using forward _PROTEIN_ and reverse _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ primers including ncoi sites and ligated in the ncoi site of _PROTEIN_ . for stable plant transformation a genomic dna fragment including _PROTEIN_ coding sequence as well as a kb upstream region was amplified by pcr using forward cat gcc _PROTEIN_ gag _PROTEIN_ ttc ggt gag gaa caa gag tt and reverse cat gcc _PROTEIN_ gca ctg _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ tca _PROTEIN_ ttc tct aca ac primers and inserted in the ncoi site of the vector in frame with the coding sequence of _METHOD_ . _PROTEIN_ downstream region was amplified by pcr from genomic dna using forward ccg cgg ccg caa aca ggt tct ctt _PROTEIN_ act ctg _PROTEIN_ c and reverse ggg cgg ccg gag _PROTEIN_ tcg _PROTEIN_ tct caa _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ tg primers . the fragment was cloned in the noti site of . _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ sequences were excised from by restriction digest with aatii and kpni . fragments were blunted and ligated in the smai site of binary vector yielding _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . transient transformation of protoplasts was done using the polyethylene glycol method as described in ref . but reducing cellulase and macerozyme concentrations to and respectively . _METHOD_ in transformed protoplasts was monitored h after transformation by confocal laser scanning microscopy . _METHOD_ was detected using the fitc laser line from a _PROTEIN_ tcs microscope _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . for double _METHOD_ experiments _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ were detected sequentially with a _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ microscope using and nm laser lines and nm and nm detection windows respectively . chlorophyll _METHOD_ was monitored using either nm or _PROTEIN_ excitation wavelengths . stable transformation of a. thaliana plants with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was carried out using the floral dip method as described . transformants were selected on plates containing phosphinothricin . proteins were isolated from arabidopsis leaves according to ref . . proteins were concentrated by chloroform methanol precipitation separated by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and blotted onto nitrocellulose _LOCATION_ . proteins were stained with amidoblack for protein detection or used for immunodetection . blots were probed with anti _METHOD_ and anti cab sera or with affinity purified antibodies specific for and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . for quantification chemiluminescent immunoblot signals were analysed using a bio rad chemidoc xrs system . leaves from arabidopsis plants grown on soil for weeks were harvested and immersed in tap water in the dark at for min . leaf material was homogenized in hb buffer with a waring blender and filtered through cheese cloth and miracloth . chloroplasts were sedimented washed with tre and hypertonically lysed min in tre m sucrose supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail . the lysate was frozen at thawed on ice diluted times with tre buffer and homogenised with a potter homogeniser . total _LOCATION_ corresponding to mg of chlorophyll were sedimented at g and resuspended in ml sucrose in tre buffer . _LOCATION_ were overlaid with a discontinuous sucrose gradient consisting of ml sucrose ml sucrose ml sucrose and ml sucrose in tre buffer and centrifuged for h at g and . ml fractions were collected starting from the top of the gradient and used for confocal microscopy analysis or western blotting . maximum quantum efficiency of photosystem ii was measured using a handy plant efficiency analyser chlorophyll fluorometer . detached leaves from week old plants were dark _PROTEIN_ min prior to measurements .
