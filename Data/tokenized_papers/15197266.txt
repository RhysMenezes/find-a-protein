signals are thought to play important roles in plant growth and development including key aspects of pollen tube growth and fertilization . the dynamics of a signal are largely controlled by influx and efflux . the arabidopsis genome encodes pumps of which belong to a family of autoinhibited _PROTEIN_ that are predicted to be activated by /calmodulin . here we show that isoform _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ primarily in pollen and localized to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . three independent t dna gene disruptions of _PROTEIN_ were found to result in partial male sterility . complementation was observed by using a _PROTEIN_ yellow _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ fusion that displayed _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ localization . mutant _PROTEIN_ pollen displayed a reduced growth potential and a high frequency of aborted fertilization resulting in a > reduction in seed set . these findings identify a _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ transporter as a key regulator of pollen development and fertilization in flowering plants .
gene disruptions of _PROTEIN_ result in reduced seed set . to investigate the biological functions of transporters in plants we identified plants harboring t dna disruptions in all arabidopsis pumps . in contrast to animals no single pump was found to be essential under laboratory conditions as shown by the ability to recover viable homozygous plants for each of the gene disruptions . nevertheless a partial sterility phenotype was observed for disruptions of _PROTEIN_ as first noticed by a non mendelian segregation of homozygotes . three independent _PROTEIN_ mutants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were identified by pcr screening of a collection of t dna transformed plants . all homozygous _PROTEIN_ plants produced shorter siliques with fewer seeds per silique . seed counts varied under different culture conditions . in copenhagen typical yields were _PROTEIN_ and wt ws in san diego typical yields were _PROTEIN_ and wt ws . a second feature of this phenotype was an unequal distribution of seeds within the silique with of the seeds located in the upper half . evidence that the reduced seed set phenotype was the result of a gene disruption in _PROTEIN_ was confirmed by complementation . mutant _PROTEIN_ plants were transformed with _PROTEIN_ fused to _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ under the control of an _PROTEIN_ promoter . in second generation transgenic plant lines homozygous for the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ construct seed set was restored to near wt levels . thus three independent gene disruptions and complementation all indicate that poor seed set results from a loss of _PROTEIN_ gene function . _PROTEIN_ pollen tubes show defects in growth and fertilization . to determine the biological basis of the reduced seed set phenotype we initiated reciprocal crosses between mutants and wt . when mutant pollen was used to fertilize a wt flower we always obtained very poor seed set comparable to a self fertilized _PROTEIN_ plant . in contrast when wt pollen was used to fertilize a mutant flower full seed set was restored in some siliques . to further test for any phenotypic contribution from the female gametophyte we used wt pollen to fertilize a heterozygous _PROTEIN_ mutant _PROTEIN_ . by genotyping the progeny of this cross we observed the expected ratio of wt and _PROTEIN_ alleles _PROTEIN_ n p < . together these results indicate that the reduced seed phenotype results from a pollen defect alone with no significant influence from the female gametophyte . mutant _PROTEIN_ pollen were found to have two defects . first they showed reduced growth potentials in vivo and in vitro . aniline blue staining of pollen growing through pistils indicated that _PROTEIN_ pollen tubes had a reduced frequency of reaching the basal end of the pistil . in a time course of pollen growth a _PROTEIN_ growth rate became noticeable by around h . this reduced growth potential is consistent with in vitro assays that show a roughly length reduction in mutant pollen tubes compared with wt . this reduced growth potential partially explains the observed bias of successful fertilization at the stigma end of the pistil . second mutant pollen also displayed a high frequency of aborted fertilization . this finding was first observed by aniline blue staining of maturing siliques . in cases where staining showed a pollen tube had reached an ovule more than of the ovules failed to develop an embryo . because the _PROTEIN_ defect _METHOD_ to be restricted to the male gametophyte we interpreted this aborted development as a failure to complete fertilization . a defect in fertilization was corroborated by a microscopic examination of pollen tube embryo sac interactions as monitored by the delivery of _METHOD_ from pollen tubes to synergids . a synergid cell represents the point of initial cell cell contact between the male and female gametophyte . upon contact pollen tubes discharge their sperm cells into the synergid . in contrast to wt fertilization > of mutant pollen failed to discharge sperm despite having reached the embryo sac . this > abortion frequency correlated with that observed using aniline blue . a prediction that arises from a high frequency of aborted fertilization is that a heterozygote _PROTEIN_ mutant undergoing self fertilization should show reduced seed set as a result of mutant pollen blocking the potential of wt pollen to fertilize available ovules . consistent with this expectation heterozygous plants exhibit a semidominant phenotype with a reduction in seed set . thus despite having a reduced growth potential _PROTEIN_ pollen still effectively compete with wt pollen in growing and finding ovules at least in the stigma end half of the pistil . _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ specifically in pollen . to determine the _PROTEIN_ pattern expected for _PROTEIN_ protein a dna fragment corresponding to bp upstream of the _PROTEIN_ start codon was fused to the _PROTEIN_ reporter gene and transformed into arabidopsis plants . gus _PROTEIN_ was observed primarily in pollen . _PROTEIN_ was initiated between flower stages to . there was no evidence for gus _PROTEIN_ in the pistil before pollination . to confirm the gus reporter results the _PROTEIN_ pattern of _PROTEIN_ mrna was evaluated by using real time rt pcr using _PROTEIN_ specific primers . _PROTEIN_ mrna was found primarily in stamens at a level > times higher than in pistils . the low level _PROTEIN_ detected in the pistils is likely due to contaminating pollen . this rt pcr result _METHOD_ the gus reporter analysis indicating that _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ in the male gametophyte but not the female gametophyte . finally a publicly available oligo based _PROTEIN_ profiling analysis of pollen revealed that _PROTEIN_ was the most highly _PROTEIN_ of all acas in mature pollen including genes for known and expected _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ pumps such as _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . significant _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was observed starting at the tricellular pollen stage . subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ . to determine the subcellular targeting potential of _PROTEIN_ an _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was _PROTEIN_ in stable transgenic arabidopsis plants under the control of the _PROTEIN_ promoter . as a control a _METHOD_ reporter was _PROTEIN_ in parallel under the same promoter . pollen from transgenic plants was germinated on an agar solidified medium and examined by confocal microscopy . consistent with a _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ location the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein was always observed around the pollen tube perimeter . the same pattern of localization was observed in multiple transgenic lines including those showing bright or barely detectable levels of _PROTEIN_ . by contrast _METHOD_ controls always showed strong _METHOD_ dispersed throughout the body of the cell . because the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion was able to complement an _PROTEIN_ mutant we conclude that at least a subset of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein was localized to a functionally appropriate location presumably the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . an independent line of evidence to support a _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ function for _PROTEIN_ was obtained by showing that isoform _PROTEIN_ can also complement the _PROTEIN_ mutant . _PROTEIN_ represents a well characterized _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ in the same aca subfamily as _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ was fused to _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ under the _PROTEIN_ promoter . in second generation transgenic plants complementation was observed as a fold increase in seed set in all independent transgenic lines . _PROTEIN_ functions as a pump in yeast strain . although _PROTEIN_ is closely related to well characterized pumps we confirmed a pump function for _PROTEIN_ by complementation of a yeast strain that harbors a deletion of its own pumps and . _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ allowed the strain to grow on depleted medium . cells normally fail to grow on depleted medium . for complementation a functional pump activity is required for the secretory pathway to scavenge enough from the _LOCATION_ for proper function . however because _PROTEIN_ is a _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ pump its ability to complement presumably resulted either from a transient activity as it moved through the yeast secretory pathway or a misaccumulation of the plant pump in the yeast _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ similar to that observed for the closely related _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ calcium pump _PROTEIN_ . in either case complementation provides genetic evidence that _PROTEIN_ can function as a high affinity pump . importantly _PROTEIN_ complementation of yeast was observed only when using a deregulated pump created by deleting residues of the n terminal domain that harbors a predicted calmodulin regulated autoinhibitor . this result agrees with findings on other _PROTEIN_ that likewise are activated only when the autoinhibitor is removed . to verify that the n terminal regulatory domain of _PROTEIN_ harbors an expected calmodulin binding site the region met to ala of _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ as a _PROTEIN_ fusion protein . in a calmodulin overlay assay the fusion protein bound calmodulin in a dependent fashion . thus yeast complementation and calmodulin binding studies both support the expectation that _PROTEIN_ is a calmodulin activated calcium pump similar to other _PROTEIN_ characterized from plants .
isolation of t dna insertion mutants . mutants were identified by a pcr based screen of arabidopsis thaliana t dna insertion mutants generated at the university of wisconsin arabidopsis knockout facility . three different _PROTEIN_ mutants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were identified all harboring a kanamycin resistance marker within the t dna insertion . plants homozygous for a t dna
