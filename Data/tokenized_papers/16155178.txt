flowering traits in winter annual arabidopsis thaliana are conferred _PROTEIN_ by two genes _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and flowering locus c _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ acts as a flowering repressor and is regulated by multiple flowering pathways . we isolated an early flowering mutant suppressor of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ which also shows leaf serration weak apical dominance and infrequent conversion of the inflorescence shoot to a terminal flower . the _PROTEIN_ mutation caused a _PROTEIN_ in the transcript level of _PROTEIN_ in both a _PROTEIN_ containing line and autonomous pathway mutants . however _PROTEIN_ showed only a partial reduction of _PROTEIN_ transcript level although it largely suppressed the _PROTEIN_ flowering phenotype . in addition the _PROTEIN_ mutation caused acceleration of flowering in both _PROTEIN_ and a flc null mutant indicating that _PROTEIN_ regulates additional _PROTEIN_ for the repression of flowering . _PROTEIN_ is highly _PROTEIN_ in the shoot apex but the _PROTEIN_ is not regulated by _PROTEIN_ autonomous pathway genes or vernalization . _PROTEIN_ encodes the _LOCATION_ actin related _PROTEIN_ the homolog of which in yeast is a component of an _PROTEIN_ dependent chromatin remodeling complex . our analyses showed that _PROTEIN_ regulates _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ independent of vernalization _PROTEIN_ and an autonomous pathway gene all of which affect the histone modification of _PROTEIN_ chromatin . subcellular localization using a green _METHOD_ protein fusion showed that arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ is located at distinct regions of the _LOCATION_ periphery .
to dissect the genetic _METHOD_ governing flowering behavior of arabidopsis winter annuals we performed fast neutron mutagenesis in the line col _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . we screened early flowering mutants that showed recessive single gene mutations . genetic complementation analysis disclosed a group of early flowering mutants that were allelic to one another but not to either flc or fri . we named this mutant _PROTEIN_ . seven _PROTEIN_ alleles were obtained and all of them showed the same phenotype thus we _PROTEIN_ discuss _PROTEIN_ as the representative phenotype . when grown under long days _PROTEIN_ showed much earlier flowering than wild type col _PROTEIN_ and similar flowering time to col which has a fri _PROTEIN_ genotype _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ mutant also showed delay in flowering under short days similar to col suggesting that the _PROTEIN_ mutation does not affect the photoperiod response . however _PROTEIN_ showed much stronger acceleration of flowering by vernalization than col indicating that the vernalization response is not much affected by the _PROTEIN_ mutation . in addition to early flowering all of the _PROTEIN_ alleles showed additional phenotypes . _PROTEIN_ consistently produced serrated leaves starting from the sixth leaf . it also produced approximately twice as many coflorescence shoots as col _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ which suggests the weakening of apical dominance in the _PROTEIN_ mutants . although infrequent the secondary shoot apices of _PROTEIN_ occasionally converted to terminal flowers after producing racemic inflorescences _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ mutants occasionally produced flowers with extra _PROTEIN_ among flowers had four _PROTEIN_ and had five or more _PROTEIN_ . the frequency of flowers with extra _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ was slightly less than that in _PROTEIN_ mutants _PROTEIN_ reported previously . otherwise _PROTEIN_ showed normal growth and development similar to col for example it exhibited similar size and the same leaf initiation rate as the wild type and col . flowering time of _PROTEIN_ for positional cloning of _PROTEIN_ we crossed _PROTEIN_ to ler _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ a line obtained by backcrossing of san feliu to ler six times and selected early flowering progeny from the population for mapping . the rough mapping showed linkage with two simple sequence length polymorphism markers and on chromosome . then we generated more simple sequence length polymorphism markers for fine mapping and found that _PROTEIN_ is located between markers and . from chromatids analyzed no recombinants were found at markers or loci . interestingly we could not amplify dna by pcr at the marker locus from _PROTEIN_ mutants . because fast neutron mutagenesis usually generates a deletion we tested whether the region surrounding marker was deleted . all of the _PROTEIN_ alleles showed a deletion in the region including _GENE_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ showed the smallest deletion covering kb . a homozygous null mutant of gene encoding the wd repeat protein was selected from the salk line and the cross with _PROTEIN_ resulted in complementation showing that it is not responsible for the _PROTEIN_ mutant phenotype . we could not obtain the t dna insertion mutant of _GENE_ encoding _PROTEIN_ thus we introduced the _PROTEIN_ transgene into the _PROTEIN_ mutant . all transformants showed a very _PROTEIN_ flowering phenotype similar to the wild type . in addition none of the transformants showed serrated leaves terminal flowers or extra _PROTEIN_ the phenotypes observed in _PROTEIN_ . furthermore rna interference of _PROTEIN_ in the wild type consistently caused early flowering although the range of flowering time was variable among the lines depending on the level of reduction in _PROTEIN_ . the rnai transformants also showed additional phenotypes observed in _PROTEIN_ such as serrated leaves increased coflorescence shoots and terminal flowers . therefore we concluded that _PROTEIN_ encodes the _PROTEIN_ protein . as reported previously arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ consists of six exons and encodes proteins of amino acids . _PROTEIN_ is highly conserved among eukaryotes and has two peptide insertions that seemingly provide divergent surface features from conventional actin . the _PROTEIN_ transcript was detected in all of the tissues we tested although the _PROTEIN_ was slightly weaker in the leaf and stronger in the shoot apex . in situ hybridization showed that _PROTEIN_ is highly _PROTEIN_ in the shoot apex at both the vegetative and reproductive phases . during vegetative growth the leaf primordia as well as the shoot apex showed strong _PROTEIN_ but the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ as the leaves matured . during flower development _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ throughout the entire flower meristem until floral stage . afterward _PROTEIN_ was reduced from the outermost floral organ primordia . finally strong _PROTEIN_ was detected at the inner side of the carpel primordia as the flower matured . the transcript level of _PROTEIN_ in the wild type was not changed by weeks of vernalization suggesting that the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ is not affected by environmental _PROTEIN_ . to determine whether _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is regulated by any of the flowering time genes rna gel blot analysis was performed using plants with different genetic backgrounds . the _PROTEIN_ transcript level in the col _PROTEIN_ wild type was similar to that in col showing that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is not affected by the presence of the _PROTEIN_ gene . furthermore the _PROTEIN_ transcript level was not affected by mutations in autonomous pathway genes such as ld fca and fld or by mutations in long day pathway genes such as gi co and ft. a mutation in _PROTEIN_ a flowering pathway integrator also did not affect the level of the _PROTEIN_ transcript . together our results showed that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is not regulated by vernalization or other flowering time genes . we determined whether the early flowering of _PROTEIN_ mutants is attributable to the _PROTEIN_ level of _PROTEIN_ by rna gel blot analysis . all seven _PROTEIN_ alleles showed to reduction in _PROTEIN_ transcript level compared with the col _PROTEIN_ wild type . the _PROTEIN_ transcript level in _PROTEIN_ is fivefold higher than that in col although _PROTEIN_ and col exhibited a similar flowering time . in contrast with _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ transcript level in _PROTEIN_ was similar to that in col . because _PROTEIN_ functions in the shoot apex and it was reported previously that a mutation in _PROTEIN_ causes a reduction in _PROTEIN_ specifically in the shoot apex but not in the root we compared the level of _PROTEIN_ reduction attributable to the _PROTEIN_ lesion among different tissues . as shown in figure a similar reduction was observed in all of the tissues we tested indicating that the _PROTEIN_ mutation affects the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in all tissues . it is noteworthy that the _PROTEIN_ mutants we analyzed have complete deletion of the gene thus the residual _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ is not the result of a weak mutation . because a relatively higher level of _PROTEIN_ remained in _PROTEIN_ we determined whether the residual _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ still delays flowering . when the _PROTEIN_ mutants were vernalized for weeks a period of cold that is sufficient to suppress _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ flowering was further accelerated in both long days and short days . consistently the genetic removal of either _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ from _PROTEIN_ mutants caused similar acceleration of flowering as the vernalization treatment . these results show that the residual _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ represses flowering . however the flowering time as well as the _PROTEIN_ transcript level of _PROTEIN_ in the col _PROTEIN_ background are similar to those of col . this strongly suggests that _PROTEIN_ regulates not only _PROTEIN_ but also additional _PROTEIN_ for the repression of flowering . consistent with this idea the _PROTEIN_ mutation caused earlier flowering in line _PROTEIN_ which ectopically overexpresses _PROTEIN_ . mutations in autonomous pathway genes in col cause _PROTEIN_ flowering as a result of the derepression of _PROTEIN_ . the double mutant analysis showed that the _PROTEIN_ mutation largely suppresses the _PROTEIN_ flowering phenotype in the autonomous pathway mutants . consistently rna gel blot analysis showed that the _PROTEIN_ mutation caused a _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ and an increase in _PROTEIN_ in the autonomous pathway mutants . together our results suggest that _PROTEIN_ is generally required for high levels of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ independent of _PROTEIN_ and the autonomous pathway genes . we checked the effect of _PROTEIN_ on the _PROTEIN_ of another flowering pathway integrator _PROTEIN_ . similar to _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ transcript level was also increased by the _PROTEIN_ mutation . interestingly under short day conditions the _PROTEIN_ fri _PROTEIN_ plants flowered very early compared with col or _PROTEIN_ . rt pcr analysis showed that both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were highly _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ fri whereas they were not detectable in col or _PROTEIN_ when the plants were grown under short days . because _PROTEIN_ most likely regulates an additional flowering repressor as well as _PROTEIN_ our results suggest that an additional repressor and _PROTEIN_ act partially redundantly to repress the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in short days . thus the combination of _PROTEIN_ and weak _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ causes a synergistic effect on flowering time in short days . it was reported previously that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ genes closely related to _PROTEIN_ act as flowering repressors . in addition similar to _PROTEIN_ these _PROTEIN_ clade mads box genes were shown to be regulated by homologs of the _PROTEIN_ complex which mediates the trimethylation of histone of lys . to address the possibility that the additional flowering repression caused by _PROTEIN_ is attributable to these genes we checked the effect of the _PROTEIN_ mutation on the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . the transcript levels of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ mutants were similar to those in the wild type suggesting that they are not the additional repressors regulated by _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ of vegetative phase a mads box gene from another clade that acts as a flowering repressor also did not show any difference in transcript level between the wild type and _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ of the other flowering time genes _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ also was not affected by the _PROTEIN_ mutation . to understand the cellular function of _PROTEIN_ we determined the subcellular location of arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ . for this a gene encoding the _PROTEIN_ green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ or yellow _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion protein with an n or c terminal fusion respectively was introduced transiently into arabidopsis protoplasts . genes encoding _METHOD_ alone nls red _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were used as controls for subcellular localization . as expected _METHOD_ alone was detected in both the cytoplasm and the _LOCATION_ whereas nls _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were detected only in the _LOCATION_ . as shown in figure _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was also detected in the _LOCATION_ as were the _PROTEIN_ homologs of yeast and human . however the subnuclear localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was different from that of nls _METHOD_ or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . although nls _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were detected throughout the nucleoplasm _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was excluded from the central region of the _LOCATION_ but detected at several regions of the _LOCATION_ periphery in patches . the c terminally fused _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ also showed similar subnuclear localization . consistently the colocalization experiment using _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ showed that _PROTEIN_ is localized at the _LOCATION_ periphery whereas _PROTEIN_ is localized at the nucleoplasm . the _LOCATION_ periphery was thought to be a place where gene activation or gene silencing occurs thus subcellular localization studies may indicate that _PROTEIN_ regulates gene _PROTEIN_ at the _LOCATION_ periphery . our results also clearly showed that arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ is not colocalized with _PROTEIN_ in the _LOCATION_ in contrast with the colocalization of _PROTEIN_ and a _PROTEIN_ homolog in drosophila cells .
the wild type used in this study was the arabidopsis thaliana col _PROTEIN_ strain which is a col near isogenic line containing the _PROTEIN_ allele of san feliu by eight backcrosses into col . plants were grown in long days or short days under cool white _METHOD_ lights at with rh . for vernalization seeds were soaked and allowed to germinate on murashige and skoog medium at in short days for weeks . flowering time was measured by counting the number of rosette leaves from at least plants . fast neutron mutagenesis and mutagenized populations of the col _PROTEIN_ strain have been described previously . among early flowering mutants that flower as early as col we obtained seven fast neutron alleles of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ to _PROTEIN_ through complementation analysis . for the positional

fixed and treated according to the irish laboratory protocol provided at http //pantheon.yale.edu/ . the sections were made in . as a template for the _PROTEIN_ probe we used containing full length cdna amplified by pcr . for the antisense probe plasmid dna was digested with hindiii which resulted in a probe of nucleotides at the c terminus . for the sense probe the dna was digested with ecori which resulted in a full length probe with nucleotides . the entire procedure of in situ hybridization followed the irish laboratory protocol . to generation the _PROTEIN_ construct the cdna of _PROTEIN_ was amplified by rt pcr with forward primer _PROTEIN_ and reverse primer aacccggatcctcaatgaaagaatcgtctacgac . the bamhi fragment of the pcr product was cloned into binary vector containing the cauliflower mosaic virus promoter and the nopaline synthase terminator . to produce the _PROTEIN_ rnai construct an inverted repeat construction including bp of the untranslated region and the c terminal region of _PROTEIN_ was made using pkannibal vector in which a spliceable intron separates the two repeats . primers designed for pcr amplification of two identical bp fragments for the _PROTEIN_ rnai construct were rnai xhoi _PROTEIN_ rnai kpni _PROTEIN_ rnai bamhi _PROTEIN_ and rnai clai _PROTEIN_ . the product was subcloned into a binary vector for transformation of the wild type . for construction of a gene encoding a _METHOD_ fusion a pcr fragment containing the _PROTEIN_ open reading frame was amplified with forward primer _PROTEIN_ and reverse primer aacccggatccaatgaaagaatcgtctacgacac which remove the stop codon at the c terminus and bear a bamhi restriction site . the fragment was inserted at the bamhi restriction site of the _METHOD_ vector between the cauliflower mosaic virus promoter and the n terminus of _METHOD_ . for the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion construct the _PROTEIN_ cdna fragment was obtained by rt pcr with forward primer _PROTEIN_ and reverse primer _PROTEIN_ and was cloned in a plant _PROTEIN_ vector containing the cassava vein mosaic virus promoter and the nopaline synthase terminator using bamhi and stui restriction sites . for the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion construct _PROTEIN_ cdna was amplified by pcr with forward primer _PROTEIN_ and reverse primer _PROTEIN_ and the product was inserted at the n terminus of _METHOD_ in _METHOD_ vector . for a positive control of _LOCATION_ localization the fusion construct nls _METHOD_ was used . rosette leaves of plants grown for to weeks were used for the isolation and transformation of protoplasts essentially as described at http //genetics.mgh.harvard.edu/sheenweb/ . protoplasts were electroporated with of plasmid dna prepared with the qiagen plasmid
