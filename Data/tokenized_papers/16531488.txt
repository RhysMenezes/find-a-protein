small heat shock proteins are widespread molecular chaperones for which a peroxisomal localization has not yet been reported . the arabidopsis genome encodes two shsps with putative peroxisomal targeting signals type or _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . as demonstrated by double labeling experiments using full length fusion proteins with enhanced yellow _METHOD_ protein and deletion constructs lacking the putative targeting domains and are targeted to the _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ by a functional _PROTEIN_ and a functional _PROTEIN_ respectively . the peroxisomal localization of was further confirmed by isolation of leaf _LOCATION_ from arabidopsis by two successive sucrose density gradients protein separation by one and two dimensional gel electrophoresis and _METHOD_ spectrometric protein identification . when and were heterologously _PROTEIN_ in yeast and directed to the _LOCATION_ by deletion of the _PROTEIN_ both shsps were able to complement the morphological phenotype of yeast mutants deficient in the _LOCATION_ homologs or . according to _PROTEIN_ studies by reverse transcription pcr is constitutively _PROTEIN_ whereas is hardly _PROTEIN_ under normal conditions but strongly induced by heat and oxidative stress the latter of which was triggered by the catalase inhibitor aminotriazole or the herbicide methyl viologen applied by watering of whole plants or infiltration of rosette leaves . thus plants are exceptional among eukaryotes in employing shsps in the _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ to prevent unspecific aggregation of partially denatured proteins under both physiological and stress conditions .
the arabidopsis genome encodes two predicted proteins possessing both an crystallin domain and putative targeting signals for plant _LOCATION_ . the smaller homolog referred to as throughout this study _LOCATION_ carries the putative major _PROTEIN_ skl > with high _LOCATION_ targeting probability and a predicted mitochondrial presequence . the second shsp homolog contains a longer n terminal extension and an crystallin domain of lower e value compared to indicating a higher sequence divergence of from the defined motif . phylogenetic analysis of shsp homologs from diverse eukaryotes shows that several subclades of arabidopsis shsps and proteins containing one or several crystallin domains diverged early in evolution . the homolog carries both a predicted _PROTEIN_ nonapeptide and a predicted _PROTEIN_ tripeptide _PROTEIN_ both of which have been defined as minor _PROTEIN_ peptides and presumably indicate _LOCATION_ targeting with moderate probability . a search of _PROTEIN_ sequence tag databases for plant homologs that share high sequence similarity with these proteins demonstrated that the putative _PROTEIN_ of and the putative _PROTEIN_ of in particular are largely conserved suggesting that these proteins represent orthologs and are generally targeted to _LOCATION_ in higher plants . the cdnas of and were cloned by reverse transcription pcr from flowers and cold stressed rosette leaves respectively and fused in frame to either of both ends of enhanced yellow _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ in a plant _PROTEIN_ vector under the control of a fold promoter of the cauliflower mosaic virus . onion epidermal cells were transformed biolistically and subcellular protein targeting of the fusion proteins was analyzed upon transient gene _PROTEIN_ by _METHOD_ microscopy . the fusion protein _METHOD_ with accessible c terminal tripeptide skl > was targeted to small punctate structures that moved quickly along cytoplasmic strands in living cells in single transformants . these punctate structures coincided with _LOCATION_ labeled with a control fusion protein between the _PROTEIN_ domain of glyoxysomal malate dehydrogenase from c. sativus and enhanced cyan _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ as shown for double transformants _PROTEIN_ simultaneously _METHOD_ and csgmdh _METHOD_ . by contrast mitochondria labeled with a fusion protein comprising the presequence of mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase from yeast in frame to the n terminal end of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ differed from the organelles labeled with _METHOD_ . upon deletion of the putative c terminal targeting domain from the shortened fusion protein _METHOD_ remained in the _LOCATION_ demonstrating that the c terminal domain is necessary for targeting of to _LOCATION_ and that skl > is the _PROTEIN_ of the protein . the inversely arranged fusion protein _METHOD_ with accessible n terminal end was detected in the _LOCATION_ strongly suggesting that lacks a functional mitochondrial presequence . the c terminal fusion protein of referred to as _METHOD_ with accessible n terminal _PROTEIN_ was also targeted to _LOCATION_ as shown by double labeling . the deletion construct _METHOD_ lacking the most n terminal residues including the putative _PROTEIN_ was no longer targeted to _LOCATION_ . in line with a moderately confident prediction of a transit peptide in the n terminal end of this deletion construct however this fusion protein entered _LOCATION_ as indicated by the larger size of the organelles and their characteristic stromuli extensions . conclusive evidence that the n terminal domain of possesses a functional _PROTEIN_ was obtained by site directed mutagenesis of the putative _PROTEIN_ nonapeptide . when the strictly conserved his residue at position of the putative _PROTEIN_ was mutated to asp the full length fusion protein remained _LOCATION_ . to investigate if contains in addition to the _PROTEIN_ a functional _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was fused to its n terminal end allowing the c terminal tripeptide _PROTEIN_ > of to be recognized by the _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ receptor _PROTEIN_ . the full length fusion protein _METHOD_ was likewise targeted to _LOCATION_ labeled with _METHOD_ . however deletion of the c terminal tripeptide _METHOD_ did not abolish _LOCATION_ targeting . likewise a mutated construct in which the essential basic residue of the putative _PROTEIN_ was exchanged to glu _PROTEIN_ remained peroxisomal . in summary these results demonstrated that and are both peroxisomal proteins that are targeted to the _PROTEIN_ by a functional _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ respectively and that the putative _PROTEIN_ of is not required for _LOCATION_ targeting . to provide a second independent line of evidence for targeting of these novel shsps to plant _LOCATION_ a method was established to isolate leaf _LOCATION_ from arabidopsis . in a first suc density gradient a significant quantity of intact leaf _LOCATION_ was efficiently separated from chloroplasts _LOCATION_ and mitochondria and enriched near the bottom of the gradient as indicated by the activities of appropriate organelle marker enzymes . a second suc density gradient was added to achieve flotation of residual contaminating _LOCATION_ and mitochondria to the upper fractions and concentration of leaf _LOCATION_ near the bottom of the gradient . leaf peroxisomal proteins isolated from standard arabidopsis plants were separated by one or two dimensional gel electrophoresis . candidate protein bands and spots in the lower mr and basic isoelectric point range corresponding to the predicted size and iep of were in gel digested by trypsin and subsequently identified by _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . in line with the constitutive _PROTEIN_ of a protein band of an apparent molecular _METHOD_ of about kd as well as a distinct protein spot of the same approximate molecular _METHOD_ and an iep of about was identified as from at least two independent one and two dimensional gels respectively . on the basis of the peptide _METHOD_ fingerprinting data the protein was identified as _GENE_ with sequence coverages greater than . the protein identification was further confirmed by tandem _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and sequence analysis of at least two tryptic peptides that had been assigned to in the fingerprint analysis . in an analogous manner leaf peroxisomal control proteins were identified by a combination of peptide _METHOD_ fingerprint and _METHOD_ data . activity analyses of putative shsps generally rely on in vitro refolding assays using recombinant shsps and denatured citrate synthase as model substrate . citation recently reported a morphological phenotype of heat stressed yeast knockout mutants that are deficient in _LOCATION_ shsps and that now allow functional complementation studies of heterologously _PROTEIN_ shsp genes from other _METHOD_ . yeast _PROTEIN_ two shsps referred to as and both of which are localized in the _LOCATION_ and show a broad and unspecific substrate specificity . at _PROTEIN_ logarithmic phase and when subjected to a heat shock the morphology of the deletion strains changes dramatically compared to the wild type resembling wrinkled cells undergoing dehydration or aging as observed by scanning electron microscopy _PROTEIN_ . based on further lines of evidence including increased protein aggregation in the deletion strains the altered cell morphology is thought to reflect a general disturbance in proteome homeostasis in the shsp deficient mutants . to investigate whether yeast and plant peroxisomal shsps have a conserved chaperone function and can mutually complement a functional defect the cdnas of and were _PROTEIN_ by deletion of the _PROTEIN_ as presumably _LOCATION_ proteins from a gal inducible promoter in single or double deletion mutants and the change in cell morphology was analyzed by _PROTEIN_ . except for _PROTEIN_ in both plant peroxisomal shsps were able to complement the morphological defects of the single mutants deficient in or and the double mutant lacking both shsps . in addition _PROTEIN_ of and led to a reduction of unspecific protein aggregation in the complemented yeast deletion strains after heat stress . these results demonstrate that not only but also which notably belongs to a novel family of largely unknown acd proteins with a weakly conserved crystallin domain is capable of suppressing the aggregation of a broad variety of _LOCATION_ substrate proteins under heat stress conditions in yeast . it was concluded that both arabidopsis proteins play a role as chaperones in the _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ similar to yeast shsps . small hsps play an important role in plant stress tolerance because they assist in refolding of proteins that have been denatured under abiotic stress conditions such as high temperature drought high salt concentration or elevated light intensity . because shsps are generally regulated at the transcriptional level isoform specific _PROTEIN_ data may indicate their involvement in stress tolerance . according to publicly available _PROTEIN_ data retrieved using genevestigator is rather weakly _PROTEIN_ at most stages of plant development and in different organs showing highest mrna levels in roots seeds and suspension cultured cells . in contrast is overall highly _PROTEIN_ at levels that exceed those of in seedlings leaves flowers and siliques about to fold suggesting a constitutive _PROTEIN_ of under physiological conditions . to investigate the _PROTEIN_ of both peroxisomal shsps in more detail the effects of various abiotic stress conditions on shsp _PROTEIN_ in leaves were analyzed by rt pcr using gene specific oligonucleotide primers . when soil grown arabidopsis plants were transferred from ambient to elevated or cold temperature the _PROTEIN_ of was hardly detectable under normal growth conditions or upon cold treatment but was quickly induced after min heat shock . the pronounced induction of _PROTEIN_ was not due to stress induced _LOCATION_ proliferation and overall enhanced gene _PROTEIN_ of peroxisomal proteins because the _PROTEIN_ level of house keeping genes of leaf peroxisomal enzymes such as peroxisomal malate dehydrogenase was not altered by increased temperature demonstrating that was specifically induced by heat stress among plant peroxisomal _PROTEIN_ proteins . by contrast was constitutively _PROTEIN_ under standard growth conditions and not further induced by heat . under elevated light and temperature conditions the ratio of oxygenation to _PROTEIN_ increases and ros production is enhanced both in chloroplasts _PROTEIN_ and _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ possibly stimulating _PROTEIN_ of . during the long day light period at either standard or a maximum light intensity of at which the temperature could still be controlled at about no obvious induction of was observed suggesting that elevated ros levels were efficiently reduced by cat and the auxiliary antioxidative enzymes . to investigate whether a stronger ros production affected the _PROTEIN_ of peroxisomal shsps the cat inhibitor amino triazole _PROTEIN_ and the herbicide methyl viologen which inhibits the protein of psii and leads to the production of in chloroplasts were applied to soil grown plants by watering to induce ros production within the peroxisomal _PROTEIN_ or in chloroplasts respectively . after h of _PROTEIN_ application was strongly induced . interestingly _PROTEIN_ of seemed to decline concomitantly to induction . as for the temperature dependence of gene _PROTEIN_ the drastic increase of _PROTEIN_ was gene specific and not found for . application of methyl viologen had a comparable but minor effect on _PROTEIN_ with maximum levels toward the end of the light period . because uptake of ros producing agents from the soil by the plants is difficult to control gene _PROTEIN_ of peroxisomal shsps was confirmed in an alternative experimental system i.e . by infiltrating arabidopsis leaves with the same chemicals . leaf infiltration with _PROTEIN_ induced _PROTEIN_ of after h with constant levels up to the end of the light period and lower levels in the beginning of the light period of the second day . control plants infiltrated with solution lacking any inhibitor showed a minor induction of _PROTEIN_ similar to standard plants suggesting that leaf wounding itself did not alter _PROTEIN_ to a considerable extent . likewise infiltration with methyl viologen induced _PROTEIN_ of within about h . in both experimental _METHOD_ the _PROTEIN_ of was not induced by any of the effectors applied . degenerative _METHOD_ such as leaf bleaching were not observed during the time period of analysis . in summary the inducible gene _PROTEIN_ of by elevated temperature and ros generating chemicals compared to the constant mrna levels of supported a stress inducible and general house keeping function of and in plant _LOCATION_ respectively .
