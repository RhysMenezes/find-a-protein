to analyze the relationship between the three q snares _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ that have been localized to the cell plate in dividing cells _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ we generated transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ functional myc or _METHOD_ fusions of the three proteins performed immunoprecipitation experiments with anti myc or anti _METHOD_ beads and probed each precipitate for the presence of the two other proteins . _PROTEIN_ associated with the other two q snare proteins although more strongly with _PROTEIN_ than with _PROTEIN_ . in contrast the other two q snares only interacted with _PROTEIN_ and not with one another . because the reciprocal experiments yielded comparable results for the strength of protein interaction _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ to associate preferentially with _PROTEIN_ and also with _PROTEIN_ . thus the cytokinesis specific syntaxin _PROTEIN_ appears to form at least two distinct snare complexes . interaction analysis of known q snare proteins involved in cytokinesis . _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and myc _PROTEIN_ were immunoprecipitated from total protein extracts of arabidopsis inflorescences . _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ coprecipitated _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ coprecipitated _PROTEIN_ but not _PROTEIN_ . myc _PROTEIN_ coprecipitated _PROTEIN_ but not _PROTEIN_ . protein was detected in total extract and immunoprecipitate by western blot using anti _PROTEIN_ anti _PROTEIN_ or anti _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ antiserum . note that there is no interaction of endogenous _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ with their _METHOD_ _METHOD_ or myc tagged fusion protein the immunoblots show only _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and myc _PROTEIN_ as indicated by the molecular weight on the right side . the two postulated _PROTEIN_ containing snare complexes were incomplete both lacking the r snare whereas the _PROTEIN_ containing complex also lacked a qc snare . we attempted to identify _PROTEIN_ interacting r snares among candidate r snares of the _PROTEIN_ family localized as green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ fusions to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ by transient overexpression in arabidopsis protoplasts as has been _PROTEIN_ itself . of these _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were particularly interesting candidates because they form complexes with qb c snare _PROTEIN_ and syntaxin _PROTEIN_ at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant is lethal _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . we analyzed their subcellular localization by _METHOD_ with antiserum that detected the two closely related r snares _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ as revealed by the analysis of the individual knockout mutants . both proteins accumulated at the cell plate in dividing cells and did not give strong signals at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ but instead displayed punctate patterns that coalesced into endosomal brefeldin a compartments upon bfa treatment which blocks post _LOCATION_ trafficking in interphase cells . of interest the _PROTEIN_ signal colocalized almost completely with _PROTEIN_ in early stages of cell plate formation whereas at _PROTEIN_ stages the two signals _PROTEIN_ colocalized at the margin of the expanding cell plate where the _LOCATION_ vesicles are delivered along the microtubules of the phragmoplast _PROTEIN_ . to examine whether _PROTEIN_ might be interchangeable r snare members of the two _PROTEIN_ complexes we performed reciprocal immunoprecipitation experiments with antisera precipitating _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ . the results demonstrated interaction with all three q snares with _PROTEIN_ suggesting that the two distinct _PROTEIN_ complexes share the same r snare . cell plate localization of r snares _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and qc snare _PROTEIN_ . _METHOD_

endosome mvb multivesicular body pm _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . the single knockout mutants of _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ have no obvious mutant phenotype whereas the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant is lethal _PROTEIN_ . the double mutant seedlings grew very slowly and eventually died displaying cytokinesis defects such as incomplete cell walls or cell wall stubs as demonstrated for _PROTEIN_ mutant seedlings _PROTEIN_ . the defective cytokinesis phenotype of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant was also described by et al . when this article was being revised . however _PROTEIN_ of the two r snares from the mitosis specific _PROTEIN_ promoter only partially rescued the double mutant phenotype _PROTEIN_ supporting the idea that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are also involved in processes other than cytokinesis _PROTEIN_ . this result and the rather mild cytokinesis defects of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant suggest that there might be some additional redundancy . very recently _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ seedling roots were shown to be more sensitive than wild type to growth inhibiting aba treatment which suggests that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ play a general role in secretory traffic to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ in addition to their role in cytokinesis . the _PROTEIN_ complex appeared complete conforming to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ type of trimeric snare complex . however the other _PROTEIN_ complex still lacked a qc snare . a candidate was suggested from subcellular localization studies of the qc snare _PROTEIN_ fused to _METHOD_ which accumulated at both _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . a previous study involving transient overexpression of _METHOD_ fusion proteins in arabidopsis protoplasts did not reveal any qc snare localizing at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . we confirmed the localization of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ to _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and also detected _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ at the cell plate . using antiserum raised against _PROTEIN_ we observed accumulation of endogenous _PROTEIN_ at the cell plate where it colocalized with _PROTEIN_ . whether _PROTEIN_ interacts with other cytokinetic snare proteins was tested by immunoprecipitation . _PROTEIN_ was coimmunoprecipitated with _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ but not _PROTEIN_ indicating the existence of at least two very different _PROTEIN_ complexes in cytokinesis . in addition to the trimeric _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ type of snare complex containing the promiscuous qb c snare _PROTEIN_ and r snare _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ there is a tetrameric endomembrane type of snare complex that comprises _PROTEIN_ qb snare _PROTEIN_ qc snare _PROTEIN_ and r snare _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ . of all the members of the two distinct cytokinetic snare complexes only _PROTEIN_ has been identified in a forward genetic screen on the basis of its characteristic seedling phenotype and shown to display strong cytokinesis defects in embryogenesis such as the accumulation of unfused _LOCATION_ vesicles in the cell division plane _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . a knockout line for the _PROTEIN_ interacting qb c snare _PROTEIN_ shows mild cytokinesis defects only at the seedling stage but the _PROTEIN_ mutants die _PROTEIN_ because of cytokinesis unrelated defects _PROTEIN_ . a knockout line for _PROTEIN_ does not show obvious cytokinesis defects and _PROTEIN_ homozygous plants are viable . a t dna insertion line in which the _PROTEIN_ gene was disrupted carried two additional t dna insertions . although this line segregated mutant embryos and seedlings displaying strong morphological abnormalities the genetic basis of this phenotype was not clear . furthermore the mutant phenotype did not resemble any known cytokinesis defective phenotype . as an alternative approach we generated artificial microrna that specifically targeted _PROTEIN_ mrna _PROTEIN_ but not the closely related paralogues _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . using the > > uas two component _PROTEIN_ system in which the strong embryonic _PROTEIN_ promoter drives _PROTEIN_ we detected a slightly milder version of the abnormal seedling phenotype of the genetically complex knockout line . this correlated well with low level accumulation of _PROTEIN_ mrna indicating that gene _PROTEIN_ was strongly reduced but not abolished . we used this _PROTEIN_ knockdown allele named _PROTEIN_ in the following for further functional analyses . q snare double mutants display cytokinesis defects . seedling phenotypes of single mutants knolle knockout _PROTEIN_ knockout _PROTEIN_ knockout and _PROTEIN_ knockdown _PROTEIN_ . seedling phenotypes of double mutants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutant seedlings resemble knolle mutant seedlings _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutant seedlings resemble _PROTEIN_ mutant seedlings . embryo phenotypes of double mutants wild type control knolle mutant _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutants . scale bars mm cm . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are members of small protein families which might explain why their absence does not result in a strong or any cytokinesis defective phenotype respectively _PROTEIN_ . alternatively if the two distinct _PROTEIN_ containing snare complexes were functionally related mediating _LOCATION_ fusion in cytokinesis one might expect a strong cytokinesis defect in a double mutant that eliminates at least one component from each complex . thus the phenotype of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutants might resemble the knolle mutant phenotype whereas the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant might not display a cytokinesis defective phenotype . because _PROTEIN_ is homozygous viable we analyzed the progeny of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plants . the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant seedlings resembled knolle seedlings morphologically . similarly _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant embryos resembled knolle embryos morphologically . furthermore nearly of the embryo progeny displayed very specific severe cytokinesis defects at the ultrastructural level such as incomplete cell walls or cell wall stubs and cells with supernumerary _LOCATION_ . this figure is close to the expected proportion of doubly homozygous mutant embryos . in addition bands of unfused vesicles were detected in the former cell division plane between two _LOCATION_ closely resembling the knolle subcellular phenotype . of interest this _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant phenotype was completely rescued by _PROTEIN_ of yellow _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ from the cytokinesis specific _PROTEIN_ promoter . specifically of the seedlings that were produced by self pollination of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ plants clearly displayed the _PROTEIN_ single mutant phenotype and were genotyped by pcr as _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutants containing the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ transgene demonstrating that the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ during cytokinesis is sufficient to rescue the cell division phenotype . thus eliminating both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ corresponds to the absence of _PROTEIN_ which strongly suggests that these two distinct _PROTEIN_ complexes of different composition jointly promote _LOCATION_ fusion in plant cytokinesis . cell plate formation is severely affected in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutant embryos . semithin sections of spurr embedded ovules from wild type and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plants stained with toluidine blue . cells of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutant embryos are enlarged multinucleate and impaired in cell plate formation as indicated by the appearance of cell wall stubs . this was never seen in wild type embryos . transmission electron microscopy images of ultrathin sections of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutant embryos after high pressure freezing freeze substitution and embedding in epoxy resin . overview of an interphase cell . note internal cell wall fragments and cell wall stubs . detailed view of a cluster of unfused vesicles next to the parental cell wall . cell plate fragments are indicated . vesicle bands aligned in the plane of cell division are visible between two _LOCATION_ . arrows indicate cell plate fragments originated by the fusion of some vesicles . a cell wall stub is visible in the lower right corner . magnification of boxed area in e. a number of unfused electron dense vesicles and a tubulovesicular structure aggregated in the plane of cell division . cw cell wall m _LOCATION_ n _LOCATION_ v _LOCATION_ . scale bars . as an independent test for this conclusion we also generated double mutants of _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ and with _PROTEIN_ and compared the phenotypes of these two with the phenotype of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant . self pollination of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ doubly heterozygous plants gave knolle like seedling progeny . similarly _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ seedlings displayed knolle like defects although this double mutant phenotype was slightly weaker than the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ phenotype which might reflect the incomplete knockdown of _PROTEIN_ by amirna _PROTEIN_ . furthermore _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ embryos resembled both _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and knolle embryos . in contrast the double mutant _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ did not display any additional phenotype other than the one described earlier for _PROTEIN_ among seedlings analyzed . thus these data support the conclusion that the two different types of _PROTEIN_ containing snare complexes are functionally redundant mediating cytokinesis in arabidopsis .
arabidopsis thaliana genotypes used were wild type _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . in addition t dna insertion lines from the arabidopsis biological resource center the nottingham arabidopsis stock center and gabi kat were analyzed by pcr and dna sequencing to identify homozygous _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants . the following rescue genotypes were generated by crossing or transformation _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plants _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plants _PROTEIN_ myc _PROTEIN_ or _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . transgenic plants were generated by agrobacterium tumefaciens mediated transformation . plants were grown either on soil or on vertically oriented agar plates with g/l murashige and skoog _METHOD_ medium containing sucrose in growth chambers at with a h photoperiod or in continuous light . cloning of artificial microrna for _PROTEIN_ was done as described _PROTEIN_ . for the two component _PROTEIN_ system the amirna was cloned under the responsive uas element and these reporter lines were crossed with the _PROTEIN_ activator lines . for subcellular localization studies the dna sequence encoding myc epitope _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ was fused in frame to the _PROTEIN_ codon of the respective coding sequence and downstream of the _PROTEIN_ regulatory sequences _PROTEIN_ . for transcriptional analysis total rna was extracted from seedlings or one to two rosette leaves by the _PROTEIN_ rna extraction method . after dna digestion first strand cdna was synthesized with revertaid h minus first strand cdna synthesis kit using an oligo dt primer . the resulting cdna was used for pcr . primers used for cloning genotyping and reverse transcription pcr are listed in supplemental table . the immunoprecipitation procedure was modified from _PROTEIN_ et al . . total protein extracts were prepared from g of inflorescences . we added of agarose conjugated lama anti _METHOD_ _METHOD_ or mouse anti myc antibodies to ml of protein extract and incubated them at for h on a rolling incubator . all immunoprecipitation experiments were repeated at least twice . immunoblot analysis was done as described previously _PROTEIN_ . antibody dilutions were as follows rabbit anti _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ rabbit anti _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ rabbit anti _PROTEIN_ rabbit anti _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ rabbit anti _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and sheep anti rabbit immunoglobulin g pod polyclonal antibody . live imaging whole mount _METHOD_ and diamidino phenylindole staining of seedlings were performed as described _PROTEIN_ . confocal laser scanning microscopy was done with a leica tcs microscope . images were obtained with a water immersion objective and leica software and processed using photoshop and illustrator software _PROTEIN_ . antibodies and their dilutions used for if were rabbit anti _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mouse anti myc rabbit anti _PROTEIN_ rabbit anti _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ rabbit anti _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ fluorescein isothiocyanate conjugated goat anti rabbit and conjugated goat anti mouse . ultrastructural analysis of embryos was carried out after high pressure freezing freeze substitution and embedding in epoxy resin _PROTEIN_ . seedlings and whole mount chloral hydrate preparations of embryos were analyzed using a leica or leica mzfliii binocular or a zeiss axiophot microscope . images were taken with a _PROTEIN_ digital camera a leica camera or an axiocam using axiovision software . images were processed using photoshop and . sectioning was done as described _PROTEIN_ .
