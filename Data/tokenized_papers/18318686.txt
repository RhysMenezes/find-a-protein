arabidopsis thaliana heynh . possesses two protein l isoaspartate methyltransferase _PROTEIN_ genes encoding enzymes capable of converting uncoded l isoaspartyl residues arising spontaneously at l asparaginyl and l aspartyl sites in proteins to l aspartate . _PROTEIN_ produces at least eight transcripts by using four transcriptional initiation sites and both and alternative splice site selection of the first intron . the transcripts produce mature proteins capable of converting l isoaspartate to l aspartate in small peptide substrates . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion proteins generated a detectable signal in the _LOCATION_ . however whether the protein was also detectable in the cytoplasm endo _LOCATION_ system chloroplasts and/or mitochondria depended on the transcript from which it was produced . on blot methylation of proteins prior to the completion of germination indicated that cruciferin subunits contain isoaspartate . the implications of using transcriptional _METHOD_ to expand a single gene s repertoire to protein variants capable of entry into the cell s various compartments are discussed in light of _PROTEIN_ s presumed role in repairing the proteome .
characterization of _PROTEIN_ identified rapid amplification of cdna ends _PROTEIN_ products . two cdna clones of _PROTEIN_ tisi differing by a nine nucleotide alternative splicing event were assembled and reported . of the remaining _PROTEIN_ products seven terminated in a region designated as the second transcriptional initiation site and four _PROTEIN_ amplicons terminated in a region containing a third transcriptional initiation site . a transcript commencing at tisi was confirmed from amplicons retrieved while verifying and alternative splicing variants using pcr primers one of which bound to the region of cdnas synthesized exclusively from tisi transcripts . however whether the other tiss discovered by _PROTEIN_ were real or were from truncated mrna that avoided the dephosphorylation step associated with the capped rna _PROTEIN_ protocol remained unresolved . the riboprobe used to map the termini of _PROTEIN_ transcripts by ribonuclease protection assays _PROTEIN_ was prone to self protection and so primer extension analysis on total rna from seedlings or rosette leaves was used instead . for each of the amplicons associated with each tis no one consensus nucleotide was consistently identified by _PROTEIN_ as the initiation site . rather _PROTEIN_ identified different termini for each tis all within a region of bp depending on the tis . so we also wanted to determine whether there were predominant nucleotides from which transcription usually commenced in each tis region or whether transcription initiation along the _PROTEIN_ gene was promiscuous . to do this we chose the longest _PROTEIN_ product discovered for each of the three tiss and amplified _PROTEIN_ cdna from it using pcr . these amplicons were diluted and included as positive controls in the primer extension analysis . primer extension revealed that there were at least four discrete predominant tiss for _PROTEIN_ . the tis i identified by _PROTEIN_ was very similar to that revealed by primer extension lying between and nucleotides of the _PROTEIN_ . the longest tisii discerned using _PROTEIN_ was considerably longer than two predominant tisiis discovered by primer extension . because both of these tisii sites were still to the translational initiation codon they were designated tisiia and tisiib because they would result in the same protein to the left of the bands in the experimental lanes . the difference among the tisii discovered by primer extension and that from _PROTEIN_ was approximately and nucleotides with tisiib at least nucleotides to the _PROTEIN_ . the tisiii documented by _PROTEIN_ was also considerably longer than the most predominant tisiii observed using primer extension in the experimental lanes rna . the difference in length was approximately nucleotides which was still to the translational initiation for the _PROTEIN_ tisiii protein which could not be resolved with the primer used for the primer extension and sequencing . based on the sequences retrieved from _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ transcripts are subject to alternative and splice site selection of the first intron . at least one amplicon terminating in each of the three transcriptional initiation regions was differentially spliced at the end . one of seven _PROTEIN_ products terminating in the tisii region utilized the alternative splice site . using primers spanning intron i the most of which was specific for cdnas from transcripts commencing at tisi three amplicons were obtained that when sequenced corresponded to _PROTEIN_ and . we did not observe amplicons corresponding to a splicing event . neither did we have indications that the other two introns in _PROTEIN_ were differentially spliced . we were unable to establish the existence of _PROTEIN_ using _PROTEIN_ but neither can we exclude this possibility and based on the presence of a splicing event for the other tis determined its existence was probable . our data indicate that there are no fewer than four predominant transcriptional initiation sites in _PROTEIN_ and that these transcripts can be further modified using either or alternative splice site selection of the first intron . attempts to verify the existence of proteins translated from the various transcripts in vivo were only partially successful due to the attenuation of signal from _PROTEIN_ antibodies during double affinity purification to avoid cross hybridization with _PROTEIN_ . nevertheless a second immunoreactive protein possibly corresponding to protein from a _PROTEIN_ tisii splicing variant was present in cell fractions containing _PROTEIN_ tisi protein . to maximize the sensitivity of the western blot analysis we used antibodies that had undergone a single affinity purification that bound to _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ tisi tisii and tisiii . _PROTEIN_ of where else the _PROTEIN_ proteins resided they were all discernible to some degree in the _LOCATION_ and we reasoned that these _METHOD_ would retain their n termini which would allow the prediction of immunoreactive band sizes on a western blot . as was the case in a previous study we found no indication of a _PROTEIN_ protein . however a band corresponding in size to _PROTEIN_ and/or was discernible . longer exposure of the blot revealed bands that are in the correct size range for all three _PROTEIN_ tis ii proteins generated from the three splicing variants and . there are also bands that could correspond to any of the _PROTEIN_ tisiii proteins including . because the isoelectric points do not vary between the and splice variants western blots from two dimensional gels were no more helpful in determining the exact number of _PROTEIN_ proteins in vivo than the one dimensional blot portrayed . it is possible that the various proteins produced from the _PROTEIN_ transcripts include target peptides that are removed upon import into the mitochondria and/or _LOCATION_ . predictions of the size of the protein produced upon such import corresponded with bands present on the western blot despite the _PROTEIN_ that the protein came from crude _LOCATION_ preparations . protein subcellular localization was correlated throughout the study with a variety of control fusion proteins targeted to the _LOCATION_ the mitochondria the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ the cytoplasm and _LOCATION_ or associated with the microtubules . _PROTEIN_ fused to the green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ and appropriate control plasmids using red _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ or dsred targeted to various subcellular compartments were co bombarded into cells on gold particles . when _PROTEIN_ alone without a fusion the distribution of _METHOD_ and dsred were very similar being distributed throughout the cytoplasm and _LOCATION_ . they were not associated with the mitochondria or the chloroplasts _METHOD_ . _PROTEIN_ showed a similar distribution to that of the _METHOD_ but with a greater propensity to aggregate in threads throughout the cell surrounding but not entering the chloroplasts . suspecting that these threads might be cytoskeletal in nature the distribution of dsred and _PROTEIN_ was examined in co bombarded cells . there does not seem to be an exact match between where _PROTEIN_ and tubulin are situated but there is some overlap . _PROTEIN_ of transcriptional initiation site or splicing variant the _PROTEIN_ proteins were all observed in the _LOCATION_ in most cells . however in many instances the presence of the fusion protein in the _LOCATION_ appeared at low levels probably due to lack of exclusion from the _LOCATION_ as seen with _METHOD_ alone and not due to import or sequestering . indeed although the _LOCATION_ localization signal was only present in _PROTEIN_ proteins translated from a message commencing from the first tis none of these proteins had the _LOCATION_ as their primary residence . instead both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were predominately present in the chloroplasts and in small motile bodies suspected of being mitochondria . _PROTEIN_ was not observed in the chloroplasts but was present in small motile bodies . mitochondrial localization was confirmed when cells were co bombarded with a mitochondrial targeted _METHOD_ construct . the and proteins were prominent in the _LOCATION_ to which the _METHOD_ dsred fusion was directed . they were also present throughout the cell similar to _METHOD_ alone . both proteins appeared to surround but not enter the _LOCATION_ in the same manner as _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ tisii protein produced from transcript using the alternative splice site were present in the chloroplasts and in the mitochondria to which the mitochondrial targeted _METHOD_ fusion protein was also directed . there were no differences in subcellular residence of _PROTEIN_ tisiii proteins from transcripts using or splice sites both being located in the _LOCATION_ and throughout the cytoplasm . the pervasive strands formed by the _METHOD_ fused _PROTEIN_ tisiii proteins produced from transcript spliced suggested they might be associated with components of the _LOCATION_ . a co bombarded coding region fused to the dsred cdna indicated that at least some and like the _PROTEIN_ protein was co localized with the protein in association with microtubules . in addition to low level _PROTEIN_ in the _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ was present in the chloroplasts and was associated with cytoplasmic strands that co localized with an _LOCATION_ targeted _METHOD_ fusion protein . the predominant predicted and observed subcellular locale of each _PROTEIN_ isoform were frequently different . attempts to use recombinant arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ for on blot methylation were unsuccessful while signal from recombinant human _PROTEIN_ was detectable and resolution improved using enhance spray and x ray film rather than a tritium screen . preparing the blotted extracts for obm allowed rhspimt to renature sufficiently to bind s adenosyl l methionine . liquid assays with only rhspimt as both enzyme and substrate indicated that the signal was not due to self repair . seed extracts exhibited several prominent bands . protein abundance based on _METHOD_ staining did not invariably correspond with signal intensity from obm . in all cored samples were sequenced of which were unique . five samples from a separate obm experiment were cored from their _METHOD_ stained gel and these were identified as the same acid/basic subunit from the same gene product demonstrating repeatability
