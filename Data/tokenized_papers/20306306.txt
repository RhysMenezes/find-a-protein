though shoot apical _METHOD_ _METHOD_ commonly exhibit low or no competence for transformation the potent regeneration of this tissue merits further research . especially when shoot regeneration is recalcitrant using other tissues as explants sam probably is an excellent selection . in cockscomb plants using _METHOD_ from seedlings obtained from _METHOD_ medium with mg ba as explants high frequency of transformation is obtained whereas control _METHOD_ performed poorly for transformation . these _METHOD_ are malformed in morphology compared to control _METHOD_ . further observation found that in these _METHOD_ cell proliferation and/or te formation are seen which are not found in control _METHOD_ . gus assays indicated that gus positive blue spots at te zones are obvious whereas the case was contrary in control _METHOD_ . all these data suggest that cell proliferation and/or te formation might cause high effective transformation . this transformation system should facilitate the use of this species for studies on gene manipulation and _PROTEIN_ . therefore we introduced _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ to cockscomb via agrobacterium tumefaciens . asymmetric _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ gene of arabidopsis is a member of the asymmetric _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ /lateral organ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ domain gene family and its function is largely unclear . by confocal laser scanning microscopy we found that in most over _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ cockscomb plants _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein was in discrete _LOCATION_ location . these results indicate that the t dna contains within the construct inserted into the host chromosomes in an integral form and also suggest that _PROTEIN_ might be a _LOCATION_ protein and function as a potential transcription _PROTEIN_ . moreover _METHOD_ of the over _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ plants show needle like patterns that lack organ primordial suggesting _PROTEIN_ might be involved in sustaining indeterminate cell fate of _METHOD_ .
using _METHOD_ from seedling obtained from _METHOD_ medium with mg ba as starting material transformation frequency was not significantly altered at to day developmental age of explants . by contrast using _METHOD_ from seedling obtained from _METHOD_ medium with mg ba as starting material the number was slightly altered at to day developmental age of explants . moreover using _METHOD_ from day seedlings obtained from _METHOD_ medium with mg ba as starting material the highest number assayed by pcr was and whereas using _METHOD_ from day seedling obtained from _METHOD_ medium with mg ba as starting material the number assayed by pcr was and . rooting and transplantation of transgenic cockscomb plants were performed as was described in . to better elucidate why using these malformed _METHOD_ can dramatically enhance the transformation frequency we characterized the anatomical features of their _METHOD_ . in control seedlings leaf primordial initiated from flanks of _METHOD_ and their _METHOD_ showed patterning of a rounded hump or protuberance whereas though organ primordial was also initiated from sam flanks these malformed _METHOD_ displayed the extended patterns . furthermore in these malformed _METHOD_ transdifferentiation of cells from nonvascular tissues into te like cells was observed which was never found in control _METHOD_ . the wall _PROTEIN_ of te like cells were also seen . it was well known that cells in control _METHOD_ were smaller and more densely cytoplasmic than the progressively larger cells seen surrounding the meristem whereas patterning of cell expansion always was seen in these malformed _METHOD_ . the abnormal cell patterning of these malformed _METHOD_ suggests that they might be actively dividing cells . thus these malformed _METHOD_ might be involved in strong cell division and transdifferentiation which might result in competence for transformation . the anatomical features reveal that these malformed _METHOD_ contain proliferation and transdifferentiation cells . thus we speculate that these cells might be high competent state for transformation and thus result in high transformation frequency . to confirm this hypothesis we performed gus _PROTEIN_ in these malformed _METHOD_ . gus assays indicated that highly effective transformation occurred as displayed by gus positive blue spots at specific zones in these malformed _METHOD_ whereas the case was contrary in control _METHOD_ . these data indicate that gus positive blue spots of two kinds of _METHOD_ were consistent with their transformation frequency . furthermore by observing the anatomical features of gus _PROTEIN_ we found that in the transdifferentiation and long cells of these malformed _METHOD_ gus gene was strongly _PROTEIN_ whereas the case was contrary in control _METHOD_ . in general our data suggest that there is a close relationship between competent state and proliferation or transdifferentiation cells and gus positive blue spots of two kinds of _METHOD_ were approximately consistent with their transformation frequency . to conclusively determine the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ we generated a fusion construct in which the _PROTEIN_ coding sequence was fused to _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ from the promoter . using our transformation protocol we introduced _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ to cockscomb plants . quantification of rt pcr indicated _PROTEIN_ strongly _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ cockscomb plants but not in wild type . furthermore _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in the leaves of the over _PROTEIN_ cockscomb plants are visualized by confocal laser scanning microscopy . a _METHOD_ only control was localized to both the cytoplasm and the _LOCATION_ whereas the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion in the leaves of most the over _PROTEIN_ cockscomb plants were exclusively localized in _LOCATION_ . the data suggest that _PROTEIN_ was a _LOCATION_ protein and functioned as a potential transcription _PROTEIN_ . we also found that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein was localized in discrete subnuclear bodies . these bodies were observed in the central of the nucleoplasm . these results also indicate that the t dna contains within the construct inserted into the host chromosomes in an integral form . the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ in the guard cells of mature the over _PROTEIN_ cockscomb leaf was also intensive . optical sectioning through the center of the cell testified that the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was localized to the central of stomata in guard cells . the result suggests that the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein may also be localized on the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . the _METHOD_ of wild type cockscomb showed the pattern of a rounded hump or protuberance whereas the _METHOD_ of the over _PROTEIN_ cockscomb plants arrested activity after formation of some _PROTEIN_ branches terminating in a needle like pattern that lacked organ primordial . strong signals from _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ under the control of the promoter were detected in cells at these malformed _METHOD_ whereas no any signals were detected in cells at control _METHOD_ . these data indicate that these malformed _METHOD_ might be triggered by overexpression of _PROTEIN_ .
cockscomb seeds were obtained from flower seed corporation of beijing . these seeds were surface sterilized with alcohol for min and for min rinsed three times with sterile water and germinated on _METHOD_ medium with or mg ba . seedlings were grown under h h dark cycles with cool white _METHOD_ light of umol at . in this transformation protocol we used the vector of plasmid containing nptii and gus genes . and we also used the binary vector pbin pmd which contains the _METHOD_ and coding sequences of _PROTEIN_ . two kinds of plasmids were introduced into a. tumefaciens strain . _METHOD_ from seedlings obtained from _METHOD_ medium with or mg ba were used as the starting material for transformation . transformation protocol was described in . rooting and transplantation was described in . _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ activity was observed by confocal laser scanning microscopy . transgenic cockscomb plants were testified by pcr using an nptii forward and reverse primers as primers . for _PROTEIN_ amplification the _PROTEIN_ pcr primers were as follows forward and reverse . quantification of rt pcr of _PROTEIN_ was performed using the scion image program as was described in . for testing gus _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were first precultured . histochemical gus assays were conducted according to jefferson s standard protocol . after _METHOD_ were used for transient gus _PROTEIN_ assays after days of co cultivation they were immersed in a substrate solution containing m buffer mm _PROTEIN_ mm _PROTEIN_ mm edta and mg x _PROTEIN_ and triton at overnight . chlorophyll in explants was removed by adding faa for min followed by min fixation in and ethanol and _PROTEIN_ of gus activity were observed by confocal microscopy .
