members of the arabidopsis thaliana phosphate family are key players in acquisition of pi from the rhizosphere and their regulation is indispensable for the _PROTEIN_ of cellular pi homeostasis . here we reveal posttranslational regulation of pi transport through modulation of degradation of proteins by the _PROTEIN_ type ubiquitin ligase nitrogen limitation _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . loss of function of _PROTEIN_ caused high pi accumulation resulting from increases in the levels of several at the protein rather than the transcript level . evidence of _PROTEIN_ endocytosis and ubiquitination of in nla mutants and interaction between _PROTEIN_ and in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ suggests that _PROTEIN_ directs the ubiquitination of _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ localized which triggers clathrin dependent endocytosis followed by endosomal sorting to _LOCATION_ . furthermore different subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ and _GENE_ _PROTEIN_ and the synergistic effect of the accumulation of and pi in nla _PROTEIN_ mutants suggest that they function independently but cooperatively to regulate protein amounts . intriguingly _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are the targets of two pi starvation induced micrornas and _PROTEIN_ respectively . therefore our findings uncover modulation of pi transport activity in response to pi availability through the integration of a microrna mediated posttranscriptional pathway and a ubiquitin mediated posttranslational regulatory pathway .
to reveal the function of _PROTEIN_ we analyzed three allelic mutants namely nla a _PROTEIN_ domain deletion mutant in the columbia background _PROTEIN_ d a knockdown mutant in the columbia background referred to hereafter as nla and _PROTEIN_ a knockout mutant in the wassilewskija background designated herein as nla . under pi sufficient conditions these three mutants contained around twofold higher content of pi than the wild type plants in both shoots and roots however there were no visible morphological changes except for the slightly small size of nla . consistent with their high pi accumulation the nla mutants showed increased pi acquisition activity relative to the wild type . we therefore inspected the _PROTEIN_ of several at both the transcript and protein levels by quantitative rt pcr and immunoblot analyses . while there were no increases in the mrna levels of and their protein levels in all of the allelic mutants were increased notably compared with the wild type . under pi deprivation conditions proteins were significantly upregulated and no differences were observed between the wild type and nla mutants suggesting that suppression of _PROTEIN_ by pi starvation induced may relieve its negative regulation of . we also examined the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ but no differences between the wild type and mutants were observed . these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ modulates cellular pi content via regulation of the protein abundance of but not _PROTEIN_ . it is known that loss of _PROTEIN_ function not only blocks the exit of proteins from the _LOCATION_ but also _PROTEIN_ their stability which in turn reduces pi uptake activity . suppression of the nla phenotype by _PROTEIN_ mutation as reported previously is likely due to the reduction in proteins . because the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ is negatively regulated under pi deficient conditions we next examined the responses of the wild type and nla mutants after recovering from pi deprivation when the repression of _PROTEIN_ was relieved to determine the effect of loss of function of _PROTEIN_ . four day pi starvation lowered the pi content in the shoots of the wild type and nla mutants to a comparable level . in the shoots of the wild type pi quickly accumulated d after pi replenishment was _PROTEIN_ at a high level for d and then gradually declined . by contrast nla mutants kept accumulating pi after resupply resulting in severe pi toxicity as seen in necrosis at the edges of old leaves . in the wild type primary transcripts were downregulated rapidly d after pi resupply which was in line with the upregulation of the _PROTEIN_ proteins . when the _PROTEIN_ of and was examined we found that their mrnas were all reduced markedly d after replenishment and _PROTEIN_ at a constant low level . the protein level of in the wild type was also _PROTEIN_ d after replenishment and _PROTEIN_ even further in the following days . the mrna and protein levels of were not well correlated during pi replenishment either in the wild type or nla mutants suggesting the existence of regulation in addition to the transcriptional regulation likely protein degradation . of note nla mutants showed much slower reduction in the protein levels of and than the wild type despite there being no differences in their mrna levels . these results indicate that _PROTEIN_ is necessary for _PROTEIN_ of pi homeostasis in response to fluctuations in external pi supply and further support the role of _PROTEIN_ in regulating the protein levels of . during pi replenishment the protein levels of in the nla mutants continued to gradually _PROTEIN_ implying the involvement of an _PROTEIN_ independent pathway _PROTEIN_ or nonspecific proteolysis in the degradation of . the c terminal _METHOD_ fused _PROTEIN_ protein was shown to localize in _LOCATION_ speckles whereas the function in the pm . to investigate how _PROTEIN_ regulates the protein abundance of we reexamined the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ using n or c terminal tagging _METHOD_ protein in arabidopsis mesophyll protoplasts and tobacco leaves . in agreement with the previous observation in onion epidermal cells _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was detected only in the _LOCATION_ as a speckle like structure in the protoplasts however _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was frequently observed in both _LOCATION_ and the pm in tobacco cells . by contrast both _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ were detected predominantly in the pm with occasional signals in _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ of which _PROTEIN_ system was used . the pm localization was confirmed by colocalization with a _LOCATION_ selective dye that binds to the outer leaflet of the pm . these results raise the possibility of dual localization of _PROTEIN_ in the pm and the _LOCATION_ or mistargeting of the _METHOD_ fusion proteins . to test which fusion protein is functional in vivo a complementation test was performed by overexpressing _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in nla mutants . _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was detected in the pm and the _LOCATION_ of root epidermal cells and was able to reduce the shoot pi content in nla suggesting that _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ is functional and pm localized _PROTEIN_ is probably responsible for regulating pi uptake . unfortunately we could not clearly define the function of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in vivo because its protein was undetectable . immunoblot analysis further showed the presence of native _PROTEIN_ proteins in microsomal fractions of the roots specifically in the pm enriched fraction but not in the em soluble or _LOCATION_ fractions . although we could not exclude the possibility of the presence of a small amount of _PROTEIN_ in the _LOCATION_ our results clearly demonstrate that _PROTEIN_ is predominantly localized in the pm hinting at a role for _PROTEIN_ in regulating pm localized . interestingly localization of _PROTEIN_ in the pm coincided with the increased level of in the pm enriched fraction of nla mutants . we next dissected _PROTEIN_ protein into the n terminal spx domain _PROTEIN_ and c terminal _PROTEIN_ domain _PROTEIN_ and examined their localizations in tobacco leaves by tagging _METHOD_ proteins at both termini . interestingly _PROTEIN_ was able to target to the pm and the _LOCATION_ similar to _PROTEIN_ while _PROTEIN_ was detected in the cytoplasm . this suggests that the spx domain containing portion is sufficient to determine the localization of _PROTEIN_ . it has been shown that and are _PROTEIN_ in the epidermis cortex and vasculature . to illustrate the cell types and tissues in which _PROTEIN_ mediated regulation occurs we then examined the _PROTEIN_ pattern of _PROTEIN_ by fusing its promoter containing untranslated region with the _PROTEIN_ reporter gene . under high pi conditions gus staining was clearly observed in the root tips and vascular tissues of young roots . interestingly in the maturation zone proximal to the hypocotyls only the cortex and epidermis were stained but not the vascular tissues . these observations suggest that _PROTEIN_ mediated regulation occurs in different root cell types . under pi deficient conditions _PROTEIN_ is posttranscriptionally downregulated by so the gus gene was repressed . by contrast the gus activity driven by the promoter was shown strongly in the pi starved roots . similar to _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ pattern the signal was restricted in the epidermis and cortex of the proximal part of the roots but gus staining was detected in all the cell types near the root tips . in shoots the gus activity driven by _PROTEIN_ or the promoter was broadly distributed including in the vascular tissues and hydathodes but the signals were weaker than those in roots which is consistent with their transcript levels . the _PROTEIN_ pattern of _PROTEIN_ under pi sufficient conditions mostly overlapped with that of under pi deficient conditions suggesting that mediated _PROTEIN_ repression occurs in these tissues . because of the putative ubiquitin ligase activity of _PROTEIN_ and the increase of proteins in nla mutants we hypothesized that _PROTEIN_ mediates the degradation of proteins via posttranslational ubiquitination . we mutated the conserved cys at residue in the _PROTEIN_ domain of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ to disrupt the _PROTEIN_ domain and coexpressed _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ with in tobacco leaves . immunoblot analyses showed that _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ but not of _PROTEIN_ resulted in the degradation of and suggesting that the _PROTEIN_ domain of _PROTEIN_ is required for the degradation of . next we examined the abundance of ubiquitin conjugated in the wild type and nla mutants . native and were immunoprecipitated using anti and anti antibodies respectively and ubiquitination was detected by immunoblotting using antiubiquitin antibody . we found that the ubiquitinated in nla mutants were notably _PROTEIN_ compared with the wild type resulting in the increase of these in the mutants . these results indicate that _PROTEIN_ is involved in ubiquitin mediated protein degradation of these pi transporters . although the ubiquitin ligase activity of _PROTEIN_ was not validated by in vitro ubiquitination assays the previous report of _PROTEIN_ interacting with _PROTEIN_ a ubiquitin conjugase and our results suggest that _PROTEIN_ functions in vivo as a ubiquitin ligase that is responsible for the ubiquitination of and . in order to investigate whether and are the direct substrates of _PROTEIN_ bimolecular _METHOD_ complementation was performed to examine the physical interaction between _PROTEIN_ and in tobacco leaves . reconstituted yellow _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ signals from coexpression of _PROTEIN_ and were observed in the pm and colocalized with but the interaction between _PROTEIN_ and was inconclusive due to the strong background in the negative control . however when we employed the n terminal spx domain region _PROTEIN_ reconstituted _METHOD_ signals in the pm were observed not only for _PROTEIN_ and but also for _PROTEIN_ and suggesting that _PROTEIN_ regulates and through interaction at its spx domain in the pm . next we chose another two pm localized nutrient transporters a nitrate transporter _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and an iron transporter _PROTEIN_ to test whether they can interact with _PROTEIN_ . as expected no _METHOD_ signals were detected supporting the specificity of the interaction between _PROTEIN_ and . in addition we also examined the interaction using a split ubiquitin yeast two hybrid system . consistent with the results of bifc _PROTEIN_ could interact with in yeast but we could not determine the interaction between _PROTEIN_ and because of lack of interaction in positive control for unknown reasons . together our results support the notion that _PROTEIN_ directs the ubiquitination of proteins for degradation . to identify the residues on responsible for _PROTEIN_ mediated degradation we used a website to predict the potential ubiquitination sites . three lys residues located in the central loop and at the end of showed the highest scores . we therefore mutated all these lys residues into ala . when _PROTEIN_ was coexpressed with or all of the mutated _METHOD_ of were able to be degraded by _PROTEIN_ in tobacco leaves suggesting that might have other ubiquitination sites . in order to determine which region of is sensitive to _PROTEIN_ dependant degradation we further dissected into n terminal and c terminal portions which contain the central loop and six transmembrane helixes at the n terminus and c terminus respectively . when or was coexpressed with _PROTEIN_ in tobacco leaves although the signal was weak and inconclusive was sufficient for degradation by _PROTEIN_ . this suggests that n terminal portion of is able to be recognized by _PROTEIN_ as the substrate and targeted for ubiquitination and degradation pathway . when _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ was coexpressed with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in tobacco leaves we noticed that signals of or were not only found in the pm but also as a punctate structure adjacent to the pm which was absent when or was coexpressed with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . to determine whether the punctate structure was the endocytosed tyrphostin an inhibitor of clathrin dependent endocytosis or its ineffective analog tyrphostin was applied . tyr but not tyr treatment inhibited the formation of the punctate structure indicating that _PROTEIN_ promoted the endocytosis of from the pm through a clathrin dependent pathway . we also introduced _METHOD_ into the wild type and nla mutants to examine the protein trafficking . the _METHOD_ solvent had no effect on the pm localization of _METHOD_ whereas e which inhibits the fusion of the endosomes with the _LOCATION_ caused aggregation of _METHOD_ in the wild type . the aggregated _METHOD_ signals were colocalized with signals representing the internalized pm . however aggregation signals of _METHOD_ were rarely observed in nla mutants very likely because of the reduction of endocytosis in pm localized . this phenomenon could be consistently observed in several independent lines . these results indicate that _PROTEIN_ mediated ubiquitination triggers clathrin dependent endocytosis of which are subsequently sorted into the _LOCATION_ degradation pathway through endosomes . in the rice genome there are two _PROTEIN_ homologs os _PROTEIN_ and os _PROTEIN_ which share and amino acid identity with at _PROTEIN_ respectively . we then investigated whether os _PROTEIN_ possesses a similar function to at _PROTEIN_ in the regulation of . we chose os _PROTEIN_ for further characterization because it has higher similarity to at _PROTEIN_ . first we examined the subcellular localization of os _PROTEIN_ in tobacco leaves . both _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ were observed in the pm and _LOCATION_ similar to at _PROTEIN_ . next we coexpressed os _PROTEIN_ with at or at in tobacco leaves and found that both at and at were degraded by os _PROTEIN_ suggesting that os _PROTEIN_ plays a similar role as at _PROTEIN_ in regulating the protein abundance of pi transporters . because _PROTEIN_ a ubiquitin conjugase is also involved in regulating through protein ubiquitination machinery it is possible that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ may function together in regulating . we therefore examined their genetic interaction by investigating nla _PROTEIN_ double mutants . nineteen day old nla _PROTEIN_ double mutants were smaller in size and showed more severe pi toxicity _METHOD_ such as necrosis at leaf edges than the single mutants . consistent with the phenotype the pi content of the double mutants was twofold to threefold higher than that of the single mutants and proteins were also increased in the roots . intriguingly the increased level of was observed only in nla single and double mutants but not in the wild type and _PROTEIN_ mutants . by contrast at the younger stage was only increased in _PROTEIN_ mutants suggesting that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are responsible for regulating the level of at different growth stages . the level of _PROTEIN_ in nla _PROTEIN_ double mutants was similar to that in _PROTEIN_ mutants suggesting that _PROTEIN_ is not regulated by _PROTEIN_ . in addition _PROTEIN_ is an _LOCATION_ localized protein whereas _PROTEIN_ is predominantly localized in the pm . the synergistic effects displayed in the double mutants and the different subcellular localizations suggest that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ function independently in the regulation of the protein levels of . it is of interest to note that excess pi accumulated in nla mutants that were more than days old whereas pi overaccumulated in _PROTEIN_ seedlings of much younger ages implying a temporal difference between the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mediated regulatory pathways . in other words _PROTEIN_ mediated regulation may start to function at an earlier growth stage while _PROTEIN_ mediated regulation may operate at a _PROTEIN_ stage . at _PROTEIN_ growth stages _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ cooperate to regulate pi transport . in _PROTEIN_ we noticed that _PROTEIN_ was upregulated in nla mutants grown to an older stage likely to compensate for the loss of _PROTEIN_ . by contrast we did not observe any change in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ mutants which could be because of the induction of in _PROTEIN_ mutants through an unknown mechanism counteracting the effect of the upregulation of _PROTEIN_ . taken together we conclude that the regulation of the degradation of by _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ is differentiated both temporally and spatially .
