calcium signals are critical for the regulation of _PROTEIN_ growth in many eukaryotic cells including pollen tubes and neurons . in plants the regulatory pathways that code and decode signals are poorly understood . in arabidopsis thaliana genetic evidence presented here indicates that pollen tube tip growth involves the redundant activity of two dependent protein kinases _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and . both _METHOD_ appear to target to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ as shown by imaging of _PROTEIN_ yellow _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in growing pollen tubes . segregation analyses from two independent sets of t dna insertion mutants indicate that a double disruption of _PROTEIN_ and results in an approximately fold reduction in pollen transmission efficiency . the near sterile phenotype of homozygous double mutants could be rescued through pollen _PROTEIN_ of a _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion . in contrast a transgene rescue was blocked by mutations engineered to disrupt the activation mechanism of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ providing in vivo evidence linking activation to a biological function of a cpk . while double mutant pollen tubes displayed normal morphology relative growth rates for the most rapidly growing tubes were reduced by more than three fold compared with wild type . in addition while most mutant tubes appeared to grow far enough to reach ovules the vast majority still failed to locate and fertilize ovules . together these results provide genetic evidence that cpks are essential to pollen fitness and support a mechanistic model in which _PROTEIN_ and transduce signals to increase the rate of pollen tube tip growth and facilitate a response to tropism cues .
as part of a systematic analysis of the most highly _PROTEIN_ cpks in arabidopsis pollen _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were investigated as a potentially redundant pair of genes because of their high identity . based on the _PROTEIN_ profiling data _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are preferentially _PROTEIN_ in mature pollen and account for approximately of the cpk mrna in that cell type . to confirm the _PROTEIN_ profiling data a bp promoter region for _PROTEIN_ was cloned upstream of a gus reporter gene and used to create stable transgenic arabidopsis plants . flowers from transgenic plants showed strong gus activity only in pollen . importantly no detectable _PROTEIN_ was observed in any other part of the flower including the ovules and transmitting tract suggesting that the primary function of _PROTEIN_ in reproductive development is restricted to pollen . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusions were _PROTEIN_ in stable transgenic arabidopsis plants under the control of the _PROTEIN_ promoter _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ promoter is preferentially _PROTEIN_ in mature arabidopsis pollen . the _METHOD_ was fused to the c terminal end of the cpks to avoid disrupting a putative n terminal acylation signal . these fusions were shown to retain functional properties and were able to rescue a _PROTEIN_ pollen growth defect . in growing pollen tubes _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ showed a pattern of localization consistent with a _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ association as revealed by confocal microscopy . this was observed for multiple independent transgenic lines _PROTEIN_ of whether _PROTEIN_ levels were high or at the limits of detection . a perimeter _METHOD_ was also observed in mature pollen grains at the earliest stages of tip growth . identical patterns for _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ under the control of its natural promoter were seen albeit with weaker signals . to genetically analyze the function of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ two independent sets of _PROTEIN_ t dna gene disruptions were generated using mutants from two different arabidopsis t dna insertion mutant collections _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . mutants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were obtained from the salk collection which was generated in the colombia ecotype background . mutant _PROTEIN_ was isolated from the university of wisconsin arabidopsis knockout collection which was generated using a wassilewskija ecotype background . a basta resistance gene is associated with the t dna insertion in _PROTEIN_ . dna sequencing of regions adjacent to the left border of the t dna indicated that all insertions integrated into chromosomal positions that disrupted coding sequences . plant lines heterozygous for either _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ segregated their respective t dna borders with normal mendelian ratios of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . because _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are closely linked on chromosome we were forced to screen for meiotic crossover events as the first step towards the creation of double _PROTEIN_ knockouts . from plants two crossover events linking a _PROTEIN_ allele and a _PROTEIN_ allele on the same chromosome were recovered one for each set of independent alleles _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . after allowing the _PROTEIN_ crossover line to self fertilize we failed to recover a homozygous double mutant in the first offspring examined as determined by pcr genotyping . an independent analysis of _PROTEIN_ gave similar results with no double homozygotes isolated in the first plants analyzed . this failure to isolate even a single homozygous double mutation suggested that _PROTEIN_ and provided a redundant activity that was critical to some aspect of reproductive development . ko knockout wt wild type athe progeny were assayed for the segregation of a double ko or transmission of the _PROTEIN_ allele . bdenotes that the difference from expected is statistically significant . to determine if the observed non mendelian segregation distortion of _PROTEIN_ plants was due to a defect in the male or female gametophyte we conducted reciprocal crosses between _PROTEIN_ and wild type plants . while an expected mendelian transmission of the _PROTEIN_ crossover alleles was observed through the female gametophyte no transmission was observed through the pollen as determined by pcr genotyping . evidence that the male transmission phenotype was caused by a loss of function of both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ was corroborated by rescuing defective pollen with a pollen _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgene . the transgene was _PROTEIN_ under the control of two different promoters both of which show preferential _PROTEIN_ in pollen . the first was an _PROTEIN_ promoter . the second was a bp fragment from the _PROTEIN_ promoter . rescue of the _PROTEIN_ pollen transmission defect was equally successful using either promoter . the rescue experiments were initially conducted by transforming _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or transforming _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . the transgenic plants were then tested for the ability of the transgene to complement the defect and allow the _PROTEIN_ crossover alleles to transmit through a pollen outcross . to quantify transmission all progeny were first selected for the presence of a hygromycin resistance marker associated with the transgene . of these transgene harboring offspring a perfect rescue for pollen outcrossing would correspond to a frequency of transmission for the _PROTEIN_ mutant allele . while this theoretical transmission efficiency was never observed the transgenic lines analyzed showed an average of ranging from a weak to a strong rescue . since the strength of the rescue did not appear to correlate with high or low _PROTEIN_ levels the modest reduction from a theoretical transmission may be due to a subtle structural interference from the _METHOD_ tag at the c terminal end of the kinase . all expected frequencies are based on first selecting for the hygromycin resistance associated with the transgene . in assays for a double ko produced from selfing a expected frequency comes from an expectation that the _PROTEIN_ crossover alleles do not transmit through the pollen . for the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgene lines showed an equivalent rescue of _PROTEIN_ . for the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgene lines showed an equivalent rescue of _PROTEIN_ . for the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgene lines showed no rescue of _PROTEIN_ . athe progeny were assayed for the segregation of a double knockout or transmission of the _PROTEIN_ allele . to determine the point of defect associated with _PROTEIN_ mutant pollen a series of in vitro and in vivo pollen tube growth assays were done . first _PROTEIN_ plants were backcrossed into the quartet background . in the qrt background all four meiotic products remain attached through their cell walls allowing for a tetrad analysis to be conducted with the resulting four pollen grains . with _PROTEIN_ in the qrt background segregation should result in two pollen grains having a genotype of _PROTEIN_ and the other two as _PROTEIN_ . examination by differential interference contrast microscopy and diamidino phenylindole staining of ungerminated pollen tetrads showed all four grains to be indistinguishable . in comparison to tetrads from qrt controls which often produced four normally developed pollen tubes when germinated in vitro tetrads segregating from _PROTEIN_ never produced any more than two rapidly growing tubes . instead we often observed two normal tubes and two short runty tubes . to confirm that the runty tubes were the result of a _PROTEIN_ double mutation these experiments were also done in a homozygous double mutant background that was segregating a _METHOD_ tagged cpk construct that provided a functional rescue . with this strategy we observed that only the rapidly growing pollen tubes corresponded to those harboring the _METHOD_ tagged cpk transgene as determined by imaging _METHOD_ _METHOD_ with a confocal microscope . the same result was seen using a semi in vivo assay in which the pollen grains were allowed to germinate and grow through a stigma that was dissected and placed on agar medium . together these results indicated that while pollen grains harboring a _PROTEIN_ double mutation were viable their growth potential was severely reduced . to determine if the stubby _PROTEIN_ pollen tubes could still fertilize an ovule and generate a viable homozygous double knockout we manually pollinated _PROTEIN_ pistils with a limited amount of pollen . this was done to reduce the competition between the two segregating pollen genotypes normal wt growing pollen tubes _PROTEIN_ and mutant runty pollen tubes _PROTEIN_ . during normal self fertilization faster growing wt tubes would be expected to out compete slower mutant tubes in their quest to fertilize a limited supply of ovules . we reasoned that mutant pollen would have an increased likelihood of reaching an ovule if the amount of pollen applied to the stigma was reduced . in non competitive pollinations females _PROTEIN_ were manually pollinated with an average of pollen grains/pistil of which were expected to be harboring a _PROTEIN_ double mutation and the other a single _PROTEIN_ mutation . in the production of offspring we observed three examples of _PROTEIN_ pollen transmission _PROTEIN_ . one of these events was recovered as a viable homozygous double mutant plant . while this plant was nearly sterile a limited number of seeds were obtained . the offspring were grown and confirmed to be homozygous _PROTEIN_ plants . to identify the segregation of a homozygous double mutant from the second set of independent alleles _PROTEIN_ we searched for nearly sterile offspring in a population of greenhouse grown plants . three examples were recovered out of an estimated plants and confirmed by pcr genotyping . this represents an approximately fold _PROTEIN_ in transmission frequency . a similar fold _PROTEIN_ in transmission was estimated from a parallel screen using the first set of alleles _PROTEIN_ which initially showed a fold _PROTEIN_ in transmission in a non competitive pollination assay . consistent with a severe defect in pollen transmission in both competitive and non competitive pollinations the homozygous double mutant plants also showed a severe defect in seed set . the average seed set per silique was greatly reduced typically to less than one seed per silique . in side by side controls wt plants typically produced seeds per silique . while seed set levels have not been systematically studied under different growth conditions the observation that of the mutant siliques had as many as five seeds while most siliques were completely empty suggests that unique conditions associated with each pollination can change the transmission efficiency . wt wild type ss seed stock number . we used homozygous double mutant plants to further evaluate the pollen defect phenotype . we detected no difference from wt in pollen germination and tube morphologies were very similar . however a more than three fold difference was observed in pollen tube growth rates consistent with the stubby tube phenotype initially observed in the segregation of double mutants in a quartet analysis . no evidence was found for any defect associated with the female gametophyte . homozygous _PROTEIN_ pistils manually fertilized with wt pollen gave full seed set . this is consistent with reciprocal cross results presented earlier that showed no evidence for any transmission defect of a double mutation through the female . to evaluate mutant pollen tubes in vivo homozygous _PROTEIN_ double mutants were selfed or outcrossed and pollen tubes visualized using aniline blue staining . consistent with in vitro results the vast majority of mutant tubes in planta were runty . despite a severe growth defect a large number of tubes grew sufficiently long to penetrate into the top of the ovary . a few tubes grew further along the transmitting tract but none grew past the first eight tiers of ovules . the fertilization efficiency was estimated for both short and long tubes . for short tubes the efficiency was estimated at < . for the rare examples of tubes that grew further down the transmitting tract the fertilization potential was improved but still reduced around fold compared to that expected for a wt tube . in the aniline blue stained pistils examined no examples were observed of a long tube growing into a micropyle _PROTEIN_ . thus in addition to having a reduced growth rate a second important aspect of the _PROTEIN_ defect appears to involve a deficiency in sensing or changing growth direction towards an ovule . as a control to determine whether a transgene rescue of the _PROTEIN_ pollen defect required an active kinase a dead _PROTEIN_ kinase construct was transformed into _PROTEIN_ and tested for its ability to rescue pollen transmission . the kinase dead construct was made as a point mutation disrupting the active site _PROTEIN_ . the residue is highly conserved in most serine/threonine kinases and its mutation has been shown to abolish the biological activity of a yeast camp dependent protein kinase . all three transgenic lines tested failed to show any examples of pollen transmission . all three transgenic lines were verified to have the _METHOD_ tagged mutant cpk target to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and to have _PROTEIN_ levels equivalent to the wt controls as determined by confocal _METHOD_ microscopy . these results provide evidence that kinase activity is necessary for the biological functions of _PROTEIN_ rather than providing a structural role . to determine whether complementation required stimulation of the basal kinase activity of _PROTEIN_ a _PROTEIN_ transgene was engineered with mutations disrupting the binding ef hands in the c terminal lobe of the calmodulin like regulatory domain . a double mutation of e to a was made at the c terminal end of each ef hand and . in vitro kinase assays showed that while the basal activity of this kinase was equivalent to wt it failed to show any significant stimulation . all nine transgenic lines evaluated below were shown to have _PROTEIN_ levels equivalent to a wt control as determined by confocal _METHOD_ microscopy . to more easily quantify pollen transmission these mutant cpk constructs were transformed into the _PROTEIN_ background which has a basta resistance marker associated with the allele . this strategy allowed the transmission of the crossover alleles to be assayed by scoring for basta resistance in the offspring . to test for transmission we outcrossed pollen from each transgenic line into a homozygous _PROTEIN_ female . by using a homozygous double mutant as a female host basta resistant offspring were automatically recovered in a homozygous double mutant background . these rescued lines could then be grown and evaluated for changes in seed set . out of the nine transgenic lines analyzed five lines failed to show any examples of a transmission rescue . however four lines were found that each showed a single transmission event . nevertheless none of the double mutants produced from these rare events yielded plants with any significant increase in seed set . thus the ef hand and e to a mutation appears to disrupt the ability of a _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ to rescue the pollen transmission and seed set defects in a _PROTEIN_ double knockout .
