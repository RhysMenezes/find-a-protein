the _PROTEIN_ family of proteins is best known for its involvement in _PROTEIN_ auxin transport and tropic responses . _PROTEIN_ is one of the remaining _PROTEIN_ family members in arabidopsis thaliana to which a biological function has not yet been ascribed . here we report that _PROTEIN_ is a nectary enriched gene whose _PROTEIN_ level is positively correlated with total nectar production in arabidopsis and whose function is required for the proper development of short stamens . _PROTEIN_ accumulates in internal _LOCATION_ consistent with the _LOCATION_ and multiple lines of evidence demonstrate that _PROTEIN_ is required for auxin dependent responses in nectaries . wild type plants _PROTEIN_ auxin responsive _METHOD_ or gus reporters displayed intense signal in _PROTEIN_ nectaries but _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ nectaries showed little or no signal for these reporters . further exogenous auxin treatment increased nectar production more than tenfold in wild type plants but nectar production was not increased in _PROTEIN_ mutants when treated with auxin . conversely the auxin transport inhibitor n naphthylphthalamic acid reduced nectar production in wild type plants by more than twofold but had no significant effect on _PROTEIN_ lines . interestingly a _PROTEIN_ transcription _PROTEIN_ mutant _PROTEIN_ closely phenocopied the loss of function mutant _PROTEIN_ . however _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was not dependent on _PROTEIN_ and rna seq analyses of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutant nectaries showed little overlap in _METHOD_ of differentially _PROTEIN_ genes . cumulatively these results demonstrate that _PROTEIN_ is required for proper auxin response and nectary function in arabidopsis . these results also identify auxin as an important _PROTEIN_ in the regulation of nectar production and implicate short stamens in the maturation of _PROTEIN_ nectaries .
previous affymetrix _PROTEIN_ microarray analyses identified a large number of genes with enriched _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis nectaries . one gene displaying extreme up regulation in nectaries is _PROTEIN_ . use of _PROTEIN_ gus lines demonstrated enrichment in both median and _PROTEIN_ nectaries and also showed that _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ in immature stamen . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was not observed in other floral organs or at other developmental time points . the _PROTEIN_ profiles of all _PROTEIN_ family genes in mature _PROTEIN_ nectaries and other reference tissues were also examined . analysis of previous microarray data indicated that _PROTEIN_ was the only _PROTEIN_ family member displaying significant _PROTEIN_ in nectaries this result was _PROTEIN_ supported by rna seq analyses of mature _PROTEIN_ nectaries . another gene examined in this study _PROTEIN_ displayed nectary enrichment as demonstrated by microarray and rt pcr analysis although it is also _PROTEIN_ at lower levels in other floral tissues . full read counts are presented in table . no reads were identified after the end of the t dna insertion site in _PROTEIN_ . to identify biological roles for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ multiple t dna mutant alleles were identified . three independent homozygous _PROTEIN_ mutants were examined for altered _PROTEIN_ level via quantitative rt pcr whereas _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was examined by end point rt pcr and illumina based rna seq . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were identified as knock up knock out and knock down mutants respectively whereas _PROTEIN_ was identified as a strong knock down mutant due to a t dna insertion near the transcriptional start site . the reason for the observed increase in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ is not clear however the quantitative rt pcr primers used for _PROTEIN_ spanned the t dna insertion site for _PROTEIN_ and were located to the insertion sites for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . further _PROTEIN_ demonstrated that full length transcript is produced in _PROTEIN_ . the presence of a truncated _PROTEIN_ transcript in _PROTEIN_ was confirmed by rna seq in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ nectaries . to demonstrate a role for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in nectary function mutant lines were analyzed for total nectar _PROTEIN_ as the vast majority of sugars in arabidopsis nectar are _PROTEIN_ and fructose in an approximately equal amounts . significantly _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ level was positively correlated with total nectar _PROTEIN_ with nectar production being increased approximately in the _PROTEIN_ knock up mutant but significantly reduced in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . metabolite profiling of _PROTEIN_ nectar confirmed a significant reduction in nectar sugar with total _PROTEIN_ being approximately lower than in wild type col consistent with the results obtained from the enzymatic assays shown in figure . other nectar metabolites displaying significant differences between _PROTEIN_ and col are highlighted in table . although not fully penetrant _PROTEIN_ flowers also often displayed large nectar droplets which were not observed in wild type col . total nectar _PROTEIN_ was also significantly reduced in _PROTEIN_ . finally the putative involvement of _PROTEIN_ in auxin dependent processes led us to examine nectar production in the auxin co receptor mutant _PROTEIN_ . total nectar _PROTEIN_ was significantly increased in _PROTEIN_ phenocopying the _PROTEIN_ knock up mutant . to identify potential reasons for the altered nectar secretion observed in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ lines mutant flowers were subjected to gross morphological analyses . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ showed no observable differences in overall floral morphology or nectary size compared with wild type however _PROTEIN_ flowers had _PROTEIN_ that failed to fully expand often had reduced nectary size and lacked one or both short stamens significantly more frequently than wild type . a wild type arabidopsis flower usually has four long stamens and two short stamens . the abnormal developmental phenotype of _PROTEIN_ was complemented using a _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ construct producing plants with _PROTEIN_ that fully expanded showed restored nectary size and for which of flowers had both short stamens present compared to of wild type . n biological replicates of flowers each . p values versus col are indicated significant changes are shown in bold . wild type arabidopsis flowers usually have two short stamens and four long stamens . _PROTEIN_ partially phenocopied the _PROTEIN_ knockout mutant having smaller _PROTEIN_ nectaries and missing one or both short stamens significantly more often than col . further when present the short stamens of _PROTEIN_ displayed a _PROTEIN_ phenotype . interestingly _PROTEIN_ in the gus background displayed extensive staining in the anther portion of the _PROTEIN_ fusion . rt pcr on rna isolated from _PROTEIN_ anther/petal fusions also demonstrated a large increase in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ compared with rna isolated from col short stamen anthers . it should be noted that the _PROTEIN_ stamen phenotype reverted to wild type when complemented with a full length genomic clone of _PROTEIN_ however the total number of short stamens present in complemented lines was only partially restored with of flowers having both short stamens present compared to in _PROTEIN_ and in wild type . the total amount of nectar in complemented _PROTEIN_ lines was also partially restored to of wild type levels whereas the amount of nectar in _PROTEIN_ was of wild type levels . the reason for the partial complementation phenotype of _PROTEIN_ is unknown although it is possible that _PROTEIN_ is mis _PROTEIN_ in the _PROTEIN_ mutant background due to the t dna insertion being located in the promoter region and is thus not a true null allele . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ flowers partially phenocopied each other displaying smaller _PROTEIN_ nectaries and reduced nectar production as well as often lacking one or both short stamens . further _PROTEIN_ was mis _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ stamens . these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ of these two genes may be dependent on the other for _PROTEIN_ . rt pcr analysis of gene _PROTEIN_ in stage flowers indicated that _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ at normal levels in _PROTEIN_ and that _PROTEIN_ is also _PROTEIN_ normally in _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ of a strong nectary specific gene required for nectar production _PROTEIN_ was also not altered in either _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ . these results were _PROTEIN_ confirmed by transcriptome analysis of rna isolated from the mature _PROTEIN_ nectaries of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ as counts for both of these genes in each other 's backgrounds were similar to those of the wild type . comparative analyses of the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mature _PROTEIN_ nectary transcriptomes identified many genes that were differentially _PROTEIN_ compared with wild type in one or the other mutant background but few that were differentially _PROTEIN_ in both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . genes with counts twofold higher or lower in both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ versus wild type are listed in the second and third columns of table respectively with the vast majority being _PROTEIN_ at relatively low levels . no significant enrichment in gene ontologies was identified for genes that are differentially _PROTEIN_ in both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ versus wild type . it should be noted that we also examined the previously described _PROTEIN_ mutant and did not observe any noticeable floral phenotype consistent with previous findings . _PROTEIN_ activity was previously implicated in stamen development through redundant action with _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ however only in higher order mutants of these genes did stamens fail to properly elongate . cheng et al . did not report missing short stamens or _PROTEIN_ stamen phenotypes in the _PROTEIN_ or higher order myb mutants . the t dna insertion in _PROTEIN_ occurs toward the end of the third and final exon of this mutant thus it is possible some functional _PROTEIN_ is produced resulting in no visible change in phenotype . to further examine a role for _PROTEIN_ and auxin in nectar production _PROTEIN_ alleles were crossed into the auxin responsive _METHOD_ reporter line and examined by confocal laser scanning microscopy . in the wild type background the _METHOD_ reporter displayed extensive signal in the distal portion of both _PROTEIN_ and median nectaries which co localized with _PROTEIN_ of a _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ reporter gene . however the _METHOD_ signal was greatly reduced in the _PROTEIN_ nectaries of both the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ backgrounds even when the nectary morphology was normal . interestingly dependent signal did not appear to be reduced in the median nectaries of _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ . similar observations were made for gus for both the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ alleles . significantly plant lines _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ demonstrated that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ overlaps with that of auxin response in arabidopsis nectaries . as reporter genes were _PROTEIN_ at a lower level in both knock out _PROTEIN_ and knock up _PROTEIN_ mutants in the _PROTEIN_ nectaries the mutants responses to exogenous synthetic auxin and auxin transport inhibitor n naphthylphthalamic acid were examined . we observed a positive correlation between naa concentration and nectar production in feeding experiments with up to naa in sucrose solutions with a sharp decline at higher concentrations therefore naa and npa were used in these studies . exogenous naa significantly increased nectar production in wild type col whereas npa caused a > fold reduction . conversely in _PROTEIN_ naa significantly reduced nectar production and npa had no significant effect . no differences in nectar production were observed when _PROTEIN_ was treated with naa or npa . while not statistically significant nectar production in _PROTEIN_ displayed responses to naa and npa that were similar to those for col but with smaller magnitude . these results may be due to _PROTEIN_ being a knock down rather than a knock out mutant .
the background for all plant materials was arabidopsis thaliana cv col . t dna mutant lines for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were obtained from the arabidopsis biological resource center and genotyped to obtain homozygous mutants as described at http . _PROTEIN_ gus seed was also obtained from the arabidopsis biological resource center and gus _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ were previously described . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ lines were created by amplifying a bp _PROTEIN_ genomic fragment from col dna using the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ f and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ r primers and phusion polymerase and directly cloned into the xhoi and xmai sites of the _METHOD_ containing binary vector pore . this fragment contained bp of sequence upstream of the _PROTEIN_ start codon together with the full _PROTEIN_ coding region minus the stop codon and was cloned in frame with the _METHOD_ coding region found in pore . the sequence of the resulting construct _PROTEIN_ was confirmed via dideoxy sequencing at the university of minnesota dna sequencing and analysis facility and transformed into arabidopsis using agrobacterium tumefaciens by the floral dip method . transformed seedlings were selected on solid murashige and skoog _METHOD_ medium with kanamycin . for _PROTEIN_ complementation the full length gene _PROTEIN_ was pcr amplified using the primer pair _PROTEIN_ comp f and _PROTEIN_ comp r and then ligated into the ecori and spei sites of the plant transformation vector generating the construct . _PROTEIN_ was transformed with using agrobacterium mediated transformation by the floral dip method . transformed plants were selected on half strength murashige skoog medium with phosphinothricin . healthy seedlings were transplanted into soil and genotyped for the presence of . all plants were grown in individual pots on a peat based growth medium with vermiculite and perlite in percival environmental chambers under standard conditions h h night cycle with a photosynthetic flux of and a temperature of . unless noted otherwise all chemicals were obtained from sigma aldrich chemical co. or thermo fisher scientific . scanning electron microscopy and confocal analyses were performed as previously described except that dapi which is usually used as a _LOCATION_ stain was found to extensively label the _PROTEIN_ cuticle covering the nectaries . the cuticle prevented extensive staining of nectary parenchyma _LOCATION_ even with extended periods of incubation . thus dapi was used primarily as a counter stain to observe the nectary surface . flowers with sepals removed were briefly placed in nm dapi and rinsed in just prior to imaging . promoter gus assays were performed as previously described . for both end point and quantitative rt pcr rna was isolated from tissues using an absolutely rna miniprep kit according to the manufacturer 's instructions . rna quality was confirmed by spectrophotometric analysis and agarose gel electrophoresis . for end point rt pcr analyses total rna was used as a template in the promega reverse transcription system . the resulting cdna was pcr amplified using gotaq green master mix according to the manufacturer 's instructions . _PROTEIN_ was analyzed on agarose gels using sybrsafe . a minimum of three biological replicates and corresponding pcr reactions were used to confirm results . the sequences of the primers designed for gene _PROTEIN_ analyses are given in table . for _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ mutants total rna was reverse transcribed using the promega reverse trancription system with the _PROTEIN_ the oligo oligonucleotide primer and subsequently subjected to pcr amplification using the _PROTEIN_ qpcr f and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ oligonucleotide primers . _PROTEIN_ pcr products were subjected to dna sequencing at the university of minnesota dna sequencing and analysis facility . for quantitative real time pcr analyses total rna from _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and wild type arabidopsis flowers was used as template for cdna synthesis via the quantitech reverse transcription kit . synthesized cdna was added to the real time pcr reaction set up which included of x rotor gene sybr green pcr master mix forward primer and reverse primer to a final reaction volume of . primers were designed based on the roche universal probe library using the accession numbers _GENE_ _PROTEIN_ and _GENE_ . the _PROTEIN_ quantitative rt pcr primers spanned the t dna insertion site for _PROTEIN_ and were located to the insertion sites for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . standard curve reactions were prepared using serial dilutions of shoot cdna and primers . the standard curve _PROTEIN_ and wild type reactions were set up in triplicate and incubated at for min then underwent cycles of for sec followed by for sec in a corbett rotor gene light cycler . sybr green _METHOD_ was detected during the incubation step . standard reaction analysis was performed using the rotor gene software . pcr reactions were performed six times . the three most efficient trials were chosen for final comparison . nectar collection was performed as previously described . briefly a single biological replicate for nectar _PROTEIN_ assays consisted of nectar collected from the _PROTEIN_ nectaries of ten stage flowers using small uniform wicks cut from whatman no . filter paper . completed wicks were placed in of nuclease free water for elution and stored at until further analysis . relative _PROTEIN_ concentration was then analyzed using a modified _PROTEIN_ oxidase assay as previously described . nectar collection for full metabolite analyses was performed as for _PROTEIN_ assays except that flowers were used for a single biological replicate and the nectar was eluted in nuclease free water . nectar samples used for metabolomic analyses were flash frozen and stored at until analyzed via _METHOD_ as previously described at the w.m . metabolomics research laboratory at iowa state university . the peduncles of freshly cut inflorescences were placed in w/v sucrose solutions in mes buffered _METHOD_ medium containing of either the synthetic auxin naphthaleneacetic acid _PROTEIN_ or the auxin transport inhibitor n naphthylphthalamic acid . peduncles were chosen based on the number of inflorescences nearing stage which averaged between four and five for every three peduncles treated . following a h incubation in a dark humid environment nectar was collected from the _PROTEIN_ nectaries of five stage flowers using paper wicks and assayed for total _PROTEIN_ . data are presented as the percentage increase or _PROTEIN_ in total nectar _PROTEIN_ relative to mock treatments for each individual line . the mean probe set signal intensities for all _PROTEIN_ family genes _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis nectaries as identified by an affymetrix _PROTEIN_ microarray were compared to those in tissues at multiple developmental stages and are presented in table . the raw normalized microarray data used for the analyses presented here were originally presented by kram et al . . collection of mature _PROTEIN_ nectaries from stage flowers _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and subsequent rna isolation and quality controls were performed as previously described . sequencing libraries were created using truseq rna sample prep kits and sequenced as bp single end reads via illumina hiseq at the university of minnesota dna sequencing and analysis facility . the number of reads for the wild type col _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ samples were and respectively . sequences were compared to the reference using blastn version . quantification of splice variants was performed using bowtie and tophat . for blastn alignments an e value cut off of and
