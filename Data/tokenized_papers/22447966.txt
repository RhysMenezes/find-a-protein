_PROTEIN_ is a newly discovered atypical kinase in plants . here it is reported that an _PROTEIN_ protein kinase encoded gene _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ located in chloroplasts was up regulated by methyl viologen treatment . _PROTEIN_ rnai plants showed developmental defects including yellow green leaves and reduced contents of carotenoids and chlorophyll the chlorophyll reduction was associated with a change in the numbers of chlorophyll binding proteins of the photosynthetic complexes . chlorophyllide a the first product of chlorophyll degradation and pheophorbide a a subsequent intermediate of chlide a degradation were increased in _PROTEIN_ rnai plants . the _PROTEIN_ rnai plants were more sensitive to high light and mv than wild type plants . the _PROTEIN_ rnai plants had lower transcript levels of the oxidative stress response genes _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and after mv treatment compared with wild type or _PROTEIN_ plants . taken together the results suggest that the chloroplast _PROTEIN_ protein plays important roles in mediating chlorophyll degradation and _PROTEIN_ the number of chlorophyll binding photosynthetic _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ as well as in the photooxidative stress response .
in arabidopsis there were members of the _PROTEIN_ proteins and two of them _GENE_ and _PROTEIN_ have been studied so far . _GENE_ has been predicted to be localized in mitochondria and allowed a partial restoration of a deficiency in complex iii activity when _PROTEIN_ in s. cerevisiae . _PROTEIN_ on the other hand is a chloroplast protein and was found to be essential for ros scavenging under oxidative stress . to investigate whether other _PROTEIN_ like genes are involved in the photooxidative stress response the _PROTEIN_ profiles of arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ genes were analysed under photooxidative stress treatment by quantitative rt pcr . the quantitative rt pcr data demonstrated that the _GENE_ _GENE_ _GENE_ _PROTEIN_ and _GENE_ transcripts were up regulated after photooxidation treatment induced by mv under low light intensity in h . among these up regulated genes the transcript levels of _GENE_ _GENE_ and _PROTEIN_ were > fold higher than those of the control . predictably two of them _PROTEIN_ were found to be localized in the chloroplast by using the target p wolf psort _METHOD_ and sherloc _METHOD_ . thus these two genes were examined in more detail . in order to investigate their function in the photooxidative stress response in arabidopsis the t dna insertion mutants of these two genes were _PROTEIN_ from _PROTEIN_ . however no phenotype was observed in the homozygote t dna insertion mutant of _GENE_ under normal growth conditions . therefore the functional investigation focused on _PROTEIN_ hereafter . to understand the function of _PROTEIN_ its _PROTEIN_ pattern was first investigated and its subcellular localization was confirmed . rt pcr analysis detected _PROTEIN_ in different organs of week old flowering plants and revealed that this gene is _PROTEIN_ in all arabidopsis tissues especially in leaves . to determine the _PROTEIN_ pattern in detail the _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ promoter gus fusion protein was analysed . this consisted of a kb dna fragment upstream of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ start codon fused with the gus gene and the construct was transformed into wt arabidopsis . histochemical staining revealed that gus activity was observed in all tissues at all developmental stages from seed germination to flowering except in the root tips . this confirmed that _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ at all developmental stages and throughout the arabidopsis plant . to verify its subcellular localization _PROTEIN_ was fused with _METHOD_ and transiently _PROTEIN_ under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus promoter in arabidopsis protoplasts . the signal was visualized by confocal microscopy . the observed localization was identical to that obtained for the _GENE_ _METHOD_ a _LOCATION_ envelope _LOCATION_ protein of the chloroplast . this suggested that the localization of _PROTEIN_ was in the chloroplast which was consistent with previous proteomic data . to study the physiological role of _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ rnai and overexpressing transgenic plants were generated due to the unavailability of a t dna insertion mutant for _PROTEIN_ . of these kanamycin resistant and hygromycin resistant transformants were transferred into soil and grown in a greenhouse and self pollinated to obtain segregating progeny for genetic analysis . all rnai lines showed a segregation pattern for kanamycin resistance and two homozygous lines _PROTEIN_ rnai and _PROTEIN_ rnai showed a significantly reduced _PROTEIN_ pattern of _PROTEIN_ . all these overexpression transgenic lines also showed increased _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ in two selected lines _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ is shown in fig . . the _PROTEIN_ rnai and _PROTEIN_ rnai plants possessed a yellow green leaf phenotype in _METHOD_ medium in particular the _PROTEIN_ rnai plants the chl and total carotenoid contents were significantly reduced in day old leaves of both lines . on the other hand the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ plants showed no phenotypic differences from the wt when grown in _METHOD_ medium but the content of chls and total carotenoids in both lines were significantly higher than those of the wt . thus the _PROTEIN_ rnai and _PROTEIN_ lines were selected for further analysis . a remarkable yellow green leaf phenotype was observed in the early developmental stage of _PROTEIN_ rnai plants . however there was no difference in leaf colour between _PROTEIN_ and wt plants . interestingly the yellow green phenotype of _PROTEIN_ rnai plants disappeared at _PROTEIN_ developmental stages . to investigate exactly which pigment was reduced in _PROTEIN_ rnai plants the pigment contents of week old leaves were measured in _PROTEIN_ rnai wt and _PROTEIN_ plants based on the same fresh weight by hplc . the results showed that all pigments including neoxanthin violaxanthin lutein carotene chl a and chl b were reduced in _PROTEIN_ rnai plants relative to wt plants . in contrast an increase in chls and other pigments was observed in _PROTEIN_ plants . interestingly the distribution of neoxanthin violaxanthin lutein carotene chl a and chl b in the total pigments was unaffected in _PROTEIN_ rnai _PROTEIN_ and wt plants . this suggested that the defect of _PROTEIN_ caused an overall _PROTEIN_ of the photosynthetic pigments . the chloroplast ultrastructure in leaves of yellow green _PROTEIN_ rnai seedlings was examined using tem . in day old leaves of wt and _PROTEIN_ rnai plants grown under normal conditions chloroplasts were crescent shaped and contained a well formed _LOCATION_ structure including stroma _LOCATION_ and grana _LOCATION_ . _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ were not reduced in _PROTEIN_ rnai chloroplasts compared with wt chloroplasts . since there was little difference in chloroplast ultrastructure between _PROTEIN_ rnai and the wt the level of photosynthetic pigment containing complexes was further examined by blue native _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and sucrose gradient centrifugation . these separations were done at constant chl concentration as indicated by the chl content . the results indicated that there was no defect in any photosynthetic complexes in _PROTEIN_ rnai plants . furthermore chl _METHOD_ induction experiments showed that the ratio of variable _METHOD_ to maximum _METHOD_ which reflects the maximum photochemical efficiency of psii the quantum yield of psii and the electron transport rate _PROTEIN_ were not significantly different among wt _PROTEIN_ rnai and _PROTEIN_ leaves . also non photochemical energy dissipation was similar in wt _PROTEIN_ rnai and _PROTEIN_ leaves . thus the results suggested that the strong _PROTEIN_ in pigment content of _PROTEIN_ rnai leaves was not associated with a pronounced defect in the photosynthetic complexes or the organization and photochemical efficiency of psii . based on the _PROTEIN_ that the reduction of pigments in _PROTEIN_ rnai leaves did not correspond to any defect of _LOCATION_ pigment complexes it was presumed that the pigment loss in _PROTEIN_ rnai leaves could be attributed to a _PROTEIN_ in chloroplast number in the cells or to a change in the number of photosystem complexes in chloroplasts or to both . to investigate this hypothesis the chloroplast numbers were counted in wt _PROTEIN_ rnai and _PROTEIN_ mesophyll cells . the results indicated that there were no significant differences in chloroplast number in cells among day old leaves of the wt _PROTEIN_ rnai and _PROTEIN_ . furthermore the levels of photosystem proteins were examined by immunoblot analyses performed with antibodies raised against specific subunits of photosystem proteins at the same developmental stage . as compared with the wt the protein abundance of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and was _PROTEIN_ by and respectively in _PROTEIN_ rnai when of total protein was used as a loading control . the protein abundance of _PROTEIN_ the subunit of psi was enhanced by in the _PROTEIN_ rnai plants . similar results were observed in the _PROTEIN_ rnai plants when of total protein was used as a loading control . thus these results suggested that the lack of _PROTEIN_ affects the numbers of chl binding proteins of the photosynthetic complexes . previous data showed that chls were a major _PROTEIN_ for the assembly of the chl binding photosynthetic complexes . to investigate whether chl synthesis was affected in _PROTEIN_ rnai leaves the chl content was examined during seedling greening . wt _PROTEIN_ rnai and _PROTEIN_ seeds were germinated on agar in the dark for d after vernalization and etiolated seedlings were transferred to normal light . as shown in supplementary fig . c at jxb online the greening of _PROTEIN_ rnai seedlings under light was similar to that of wt and _PROTEIN_ seedlings . for instance after h illumination the chl content of wt _PROTEIN_ rnai and _PROTEIN_ seedlings reached similar levels . after h light exposure the chl content reached about twice that found for the h exposure but there was no difference in chl content among wt _PROTEIN_ rnai and _PROTEIN_ seedlings . the direct chl precursor protochlorophyllide a was quantified spectrophotometrically in day old leaves of wt _PROTEIN_ rnai and _PROTEIN_ leaves and no difference in the content of pchlide a was observed . the same results were observed with _PROTEIN_ to the content of protoiv the precursor of pchlide a in chl biosynthesis . furthermore the transcript level of genes involved in chl biosynthesis such as hydroxymethylbilane synthase _PROTEIN_ nadph pchlide oxidoreductase _PROTEIN_ mg chelatase _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and divinyl reductase did not change in leaves of day old seedlings among the three genotypes . on the other hand no difference was observed in the transcript levels of zeta carotene desaturase _PROTEIN_ and phytoene desaturase _PROTEIN_ associated with carotenoid metabolism among wt _PROTEIN_ rnai and _PROTEIN_ plants . these results suggested that _PROTEIN_ was not involved in chl biosynthesis . to test whether _PROTEIN_ was involved in chl degradation the _PROTEIN_ of genes associated with chl degradation was investigated . interestingly the transcript levels of chlorophyllase _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ non yellow colouring _PROTEIN_ pheophorbide a oxygenase _PROTEIN_ and red chlorophyll catabolite reductase _PROTEIN_ were not affected in wt _PROTEIN_ rnai and _PROTEIN_ plants . however when compared with wt leaves the relative amount of chlorophyllide a the direct degradation product of chls had significantly increased in _PROTEIN_ rnai leaves . in contrast the relative content of chlide a in _PROTEIN_ was significantly lower than that of the wt . furthermore there was a significant increase in the content of pheophorbide a a subsequent intermediate of chlide a degradation in _PROTEIN_ rnai leaves . these findings indicated that _PROTEIN_ was involved in chl degradation . since the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ was induced by mv it was decided to test whether _PROTEIN_ is involved in the photooxidative stress response . two week old wt _PROTEIN_ rnai and _PROTEIN_ plants were sprayed with mv under continuous light for h. a serious wilting phenotype in _PROTEIN_ rnai leaves was observed after treatment . in contrast the _PROTEIN_ plants showed less wilting of leaves compared with treated wt plants . accordingly compared with the untreated plants the chl content in _PROTEIN_ rnai plants was reduced more severely than that in wt and _PROTEIN_ plants . these result indicated that the knockdown plant was more sensitive to the mv induced photooxidative stress . to investigate the role of _PROTEIN_ in regulating the _PROTEIN_ of oxidative stress related genes wt _PROTEIN_ rnai and _PROTEIN_ seedlings were treated with mv to determine the _PROTEIN_ of oxidative stress response genes such as catalase _PROTEIN_ cu/zn superoxide dismutase _PROTEIN_ fe superoxide dismutase _PROTEIN_ glutathione peroxidase _PROTEIN_ and the udp glycosyltransferases gene _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were up regulated in the wt after mv treatment . in contrast _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were down regulated in _PROTEIN_ rnai plants . however the _PROTEIN_ level of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ was lower in _PROTEIN_ rnai plants than in wt and _PROTEIN_ plants after mv treatment . interestingly the transcript level of _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ plants was more than twice higher than that in the wt under untreated conditions . these results suggested that _PROTEIN_ may play a role directly or indirectly in the response to photooxidative stress . to confirm further whether _PROTEIN_ was involved in the photooxidative response the day old plants of the three genotypes were grown in high light for an additional d. as shown in fig . the _PROTEIN_ rnai plants exhibited more necrotic leaves than the wt . in this case anthocyanin accumulated significantly less in _PROTEIN_ rnai and more in _PROTEIN_ plants compared with the wt . superoxide production was visualized by nbt staining of seedlings after exposure to high light for h. the dark blue stain was clearly observed across the surface of seedlings of wt _PROTEIN_ rnai and _PROTEIN_ plants . no difference was observed in the production of superoxide and among the three genotypes under normal conditions . however when exposed to high light for h _PROTEIN_ rnai seedlings showed substantially more superoxide production and accumulation of than the wt while _PROTEIN_ seedlings produced less than the wild type . these data indicated that _PROTEIN_ is involved in the photooxidative stress response .
