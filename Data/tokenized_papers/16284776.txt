two class iii peroxidases from arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ and have been studied in this paper . their encoding genes are _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in roots _PROTEIN_ transcripts were also found in leaves and _METHOD_ . light activates the _PROTEIN_ of both genes in seedlings . transformed seedlings producing _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ fusion proteins under the control of the camv promoter exhibit _METHOD_ in the cell walls of roots showing that the two peroxidases are localized in the apoplast which is in line with their affinity for the pectate structure . the role they can play in cell wall was investigated using insertion mutants that have suppressed or reduced _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ or genes respectively a double mutant with no _PROTEIN_ and a reduced level of transcripts a mutant overexpressing under the control of the camv promoter . the major phenotypic consequences of these genetic manipulations were observed on the variation of the length of seedling roots . seedlings lacking _PROTEIN_ transcripts have shorter roots than the wild type controls and roots are still shorter in the double mutant . seedlings overexpressing exhibit significantly longer roots . these modifications of root length are accompanied by corresponding changes of cell length . the results suggest that _PROTEIN_ and two highly homologous arabidopsis peroxidases are involved in the reactions that promote cell elongation and that this occurs most likely within cell walls .
to obtain plant lines with a disruption in the _PROTEIN_ and genes we screened the collection of t dna insertion mutants of feldmann and the tair knockout facility . we used a pcr strategy with primers specific for t dna borders and gene specific sequence in order to identify t dna mutants for _PROTEIN_ or genes . a homozygous line with insertions in intron was obtained in the case of _PROTEIN_ leading to gene disruption bp downstream of the _PROTEIN_ initiation codons . a homozygous line with insertion bp upstream of the _PROTEIN_ initiation codons was obtained for . the position of the insert was verified using t dna specific primers the wild types being used as negative control . the homozygosity was confirmed by pcr with gene specific primers flanking the t dna insert . no amplification was observed for the t dna mutants . the presence of a single insert and the homozygosity were confirmed with the ratio of resistant plants for both lines . reverse transcription pcr experiments on rna from _PROTEIN_ seedlings indicated the absence of transcripts from this gene in the mutant background whereas amplification products were readily detectable in the wild type seedlings . transcripts could be slightly detected in the mutant but their level was _PROTEIN_ when compared to the wild type level in week old seedlings . this means that the transcription of was not completely abolished by the presence of the insert in the promoter region . high level of _PROTEIN_ transcripts was detectable in the roots of week old plants and at a lower extent in leaves and _METHOD_ . some transcripts were also found in flowers . in contrast low levels of transcripts were detected only in roots . _PROTEIN_ transcripts increased with the age of seedlings both in light and in the dark . transcripts present at a much lower level seemed to increase as well . the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ was largely lower in the dark than under light . in all cases independently of the organs the light quantity and the age of the plants _PROTEIN_ transcripts were more abundant than ones . the equivalent efficiency of _PROTEIN_ and primer annealing was verified with genomic templates . plants were transformed with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ constructs under the control of the camv promoter . endogenous promoters were also used but in that case the _PROTEIN_ was too low and the _METHOD_ could not be observed . under the control of camv _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ fusion proteins accumulated in cell walls . _METHOD_ protein alone had a _LOCATION_ and cytoplasmic localization . in vitro recombinant _PROTEIN_ and produced by the baculovirus insect cell system showed some capacity to bind to the pectate complex which is _PROTEIN_ found in the middle lamella . their binding activities were much lower than the binding capacity of and zucchini _PROTEIN_ but significant when compared to the lack of binding of horseradish peroxidase . and hrpc both show high homology at the protein level with _PROTEIN_ but only the former bears the putative pectate binding domain . the length of roots was measured on various transgenic seedlings including _PROTEIN_ the overexpressor and the rnai double mutants . since the mutants were obtained in two different backgrounds columbia and wassilewskija arabidopsis were also analyzed . the double mutants do not contain _PROTEIN_ transcripts and exhibit a reduction of mrna . seedlings containing a t dna inserted in the promoter sequence showed a reduced _PROTEIN_ of and the seedlings containing the construct an accumulation of . seedlings had no significant root length variation when compared to the wild type plants whereas the mutant had clearly longer roots . in knocked out _PROTEIN_ plants and in the double mutant a significant reduction of the root length could be observed . the root length reduction is additive when both genes are affected . the fully elongated cells present in the root hair zone were also measured . it appeared that the length of these cells was also significantly reduced in _PROTEIN_ and mutants and increased in mutant . in order to determine the heritability of the mutation in mutant lines homozygous transgenic plants were crossed with corresponding wild type ecotypes . the and the progenies _PROTEIN_ showed the appropriate root phenotype . the co segregation of the resistance and of the phenotype confirmed that the mutations related to _PROTEIN_ and are directly responsible for the modification of the root length . finally complementation assays were performed by introducing the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ term construct in knocked out _PROTEIN_ plants . a significant increase of root and root cell lengths was observed and compared to _PROTEIN_ plants in a complemented line . there was no significant difference between this complemented line and the ws wild type control .
