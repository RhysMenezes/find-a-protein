signal transduction typically begins by ligand dependent activation of a concomitant partner which is otherwise in its resting state . however in cases where signal activation is constitutive by default the mechanism of regulation is unknown . the arabidopsis thaliana heterotrimeric protein self activates without accessory proteins and is kept in its resting state by the negative regulator _PROTEIN_ which is the prototype of a seven transmembrane receptor fused with an rgs domain . endocytosis of _PROTEIN_ by ligand dependent endocytosis physically uncouples the _PROTEIN_ accelerating activity of _PROTEIN_ from the protein permitting sustained activation . phosphorylation of _PROTEIN_ by _PROTEIN_ kinase causes _PROTEIN_ endocytosis required both for g protein mediated sugar signaling and cell proliferation . in animals receptor endocytosis results in signal desensitization whereas in plants endocytosis results in signal activation . these findings reveal how different _METHOD_ rearrange a regulatory system to result in opposite outcomes using similar phosphorylation dependent endocytosis .
mutations in arabidopsis g proteins confer altered responsiveness to _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . because _PROTEIN_ contains a predicted domain reminiscent of _PROTEIN_ localizes to the cell surface and interacts with the plant protein in a _PROTEIN_ dependent manner _PROTEIN_ was proposed to be a _PROTEIN_ receptor or co receptor in g protein mediated _PROTEIN_ sensing _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . in animals ligand induced receptor endocytosis desensitizes cells to the ligand by reducing the amount of receptor at the cell surface _PROTEIN_ . to determine the effect of the candidate ligand on _PROTEIN_ internalization epidermal cells _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were treated with several concentrations of d _PROTEIN_ and the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ was captured over time . the maximum steady state level of internalized _PROTEIN_ at steady state varied between depending on _PROTEIN_ levels and was reached within min . d reconstruction revealed that the observed change in _PROTEIN_ was due to internalization as opposed to clustering on the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . _PROTEIN_ internalization showed _PROTEIN_ dose dependency and structural stereo specificity in that d but not l _PROTEIN_ caused internalization . likewise two similar structures _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ acids did not affect _PROTEIN_ localization . three analogous sugars mannose fructose and sucrose each able to yield _PROTEIN_ through metabolism _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ induced _PROTEIN_ internalization . general reciprocity was observed between dose dependence and time dependence of _PROTEIN_ internalization d _PROTEIN_ induced internalization but required hr to reach maximum achieved by the acute dose of in minutes . to eliminate the possibility that _PROTEIN_ caused a general and nonspecific sweep of _LOCATION_ proteins from the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ we tested a domain protein _PROTEIN_ and showed that this _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ protein does not internalize with _PROTEIN_ . these results show that the effect of d _PROTEIN_ on _PROTEIN_ internalization is specific as well as time and dose dependent . a critical observation was that while _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ internalized by _PROTEIN_ the cognate _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ co _PROTEIN_ in the same cell did not . no internalization of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was observed at any tested _PROTEIN_ dose including the acute treatments even monitored over extended observation times using both stably or transiently transformed cells . taken with the _PROTEIN_ data above we conclude that _PROTEIN_ causes physical separation of the plant subunit from _PROTEIN_ . animal _PROTEIN_ are internalized via the endosomal pathway . to determine _PROTEIN_ localization after internalization we measured _PROTEIN_ co localization with various compartmental markers in epidermal pavement cells . _PROTEIN_ co trafficked with the endosomal dye _PROTEIN_ endosomal markers that reside in the early to _PROTEIN_ endosomes _PROTEIN_ . co _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ with _METHOD_ tagged compartment markers was also performed using tobacco cells because their larger size provides the required spatial resolution for co localization _PROTEIN_ . of particular interest was the observed co localization of _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ a _PROTEIN_ endosomal syntaxin because _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are known to physically interact . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ did not co localize with the mitochondrial _METHOD_ marker _PROTEIN_ . these results indicate that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ internalization occurs through the endocytic pathway and hereafter we refer to the observation of _PROTEIN_ internalization as endocytosis . d _PROTEIN_ induced endocytosis of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was reduced in the absence of the subunit _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and completely abrogated in the absence of the subunit _PROTEIN_ . loss of _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ individually did not dramatically affect the steady state levels of the respective protein binding partner suggesting that both g protein components particularly the subunit directly mediate _PROTEIN_ stimulated _PROTEIN_ endocytosis . the complete loss of _PROTEIN_ trafficking in the _PROTEIN_ background was genetically complemented by ectopic _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ . ectopic overexpression of wild type _PROTEIN_ did not significantly affect _PROTEIN_ trafficking . however over _PROTEIN_ of the constitutively active _PROTEIN_ mutant _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in the absence of the wild type subunit triggered _PROTEIN_ endocytosis without _PROTEIN_ . this induction by _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ endocytosis required _PROTEIN_ . taken together these results indicate that the dimer is required for _PROTEIN_ endocytosis induced by d _PROTEIN_ and that the activated subunit plays a role for _PROTEIN_ endocytosis . while these results suggest that the freed subunit is necessary its release from the complex alone an expectation for the null mutants is insufficient for _PROTEIN_ endocytosis . a charge reversal at glutamate of _PROTEIN_ uncouples interaction between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ therefore abrogates acceleration of _PROTEIN_ hydrolysis activity . to determine if _PROTEIN_ interaction with _PROTEIN_ is required for _PROTEIN_ endocytosis we measured _PROTEIN_ induced internalization of the _PROTEIN_ mutant protein . we found that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ did not internalize under conditions that promoted endocytosis of the wild type protein . to distinguish between a loss of interaction or failure to accelerate _PROTEIN_ hydrolysis we combined the _PROTEIN_ mutation with the _PROTEIN_ mutation . although constitutively active _PROTEIN_ caused _PROTEIN_ independent internalization of wild type _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ failed to trigger _PROTEIN_ internalization under any condition . these results indicate that physical interaction between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ is required for _PROTEIN_ endocytosis but _PROTEIN_ cycling between inactive and active states is dispensable for initiating the _PROTEIN_ internalization process . one interpretation is that without _PROTEIN_ interaction with _PROTEIN_ the heterotrimer _METHOD_ thus sequestering _PROTEIN_ shown to be essential for _PROTEIN_ endocytosis . upon sustained ligand occupancy mammalian _PROTEIN_ are phosphorylated by g protein receptor kinases _PROTEIN_ . thisphosphorylation event is critical for assembly of the trafficking complex and concomitant receptor endocytosis _PROTEIN_ . thus we hypothesized that _PROTEIN_ phosphorylation is required for _PROTEIN_ endocytosis . when calyculin a a ser/thr phosphatase inhibitor was applied to arabidopsis seedlings a band shift for _PROTEIN_ but not _PROTEIN_ was observed using _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ suggesting the phosphorylation of _PROTEIN_ in vivo . likewise calyculin a accelerated receptor endocytosis even in the absence of _PROTEIN_ suggesting tonic cycling . in contrast the mobility of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were not changed by the tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor sodium orthovanadate . these data suggest that _PROTEIN_ phosphorylation on ser/thr residues promotes endocytosis . _PROTEIN_ has many di serines at its c terminus analogous to sequence found in vertebrate _PROTEIN_ that are phosphorylated a requisite for endocytosis in response to their ligands _PROTEIN_ . although the arabidopsis genome encodes ten fold more kinases than the human genome none of these plant kinases have the _PROTEIN_ architecture typified by an n terminal rgs homology domain . therefore we searched ab initio for candidate _PROTEIN_ kinases among candidate _PROTEIN_ interacting proteins that were identified from yeast complementation screens . we found several _PROTEIN_ interacting kinases and confirmed in vivo interactions using bimolecular _METHOD_ complementation . while all four kinases assigned to the g protein interactome interacted with _PROTEIN_ only _PROTEIN_ among these phosphorylated a recombinant _PROTEIN_ substrate rgsbox cterm under these in vitro conditions . _PROTEIN_ is one of eleven with no lysine family ser/thr kinases in arabidopsis . this kinase family has the catalytic lysine at the expected location in the catalytic center at an unusual position in the linear sequences . to address _PROTEIN_ specificity for wnk family members we measured interactions using yeast two hybrid bifc and in vitro co precipitation assays . we included _PROTEIN_ the most divergent from _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ the most similar to _PROTEIN_ in sequence . _PROTEIN_ interacted with all three representative wnk family kinases in all three assays but _PROTEIN_ was phosphorylated by _PROTEIN_ the most under these experimental conditions _PROTEIN_ . although _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ have lower specific activities these kinases are clearly able to phosphorylate _PROTEIN_ under these in vitro conditions . having identified kinases that phosphorylate _PROTEIN_ in vitro we next determined how these kinases affected _PROTEIN_ endocytosis in vivo using genetic ablation . toward this end we measured _PROTEIN_ trafficking in the absence of the selected wnk kinases with and without d _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ was internalized in col and _PROTEIN_ cells but not in the absence of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . these results shown in indicate that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ but not _PROTEIN_ are _PROTEIN_ kinases that drive _PROTEIN_ endocytosis . _PROTEIN_ has eleven serines within its fifty most c terminal residues that are candidate phosphorylation sites . our in vitro phosphorylation of rgsbox cterm showed mole incorporated per mole of substrate . _METHOD_ analysis of recombinant rgsbox cterm phosphorylated by _PROTEIN_ identified two phosphorylation sites and or in the _PROTEIN_ c terminus . to validate the tandem _METHOD_ results we determined if _PROTEIN_ phosphorylates in vitro an _PROTEIN_ substrate lacking the c terminal domain _PROTEIN_ and the isolated c terminal domain _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ preferentially phosphorylated _PROTEIN_ substrates that contained both the rgs and the c terminal domains and this result correlated with stronger interactions in co precipitation assays using purified proteins . in bifc experiments _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ specifically interacted with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ but not with the mutant lacking the c terminal domain although both _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and the mutant interacted with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ as a positive control . these results indicate that the c terminal domain on _PROTEIN_ is necessary for phosphorylation and interaction with _PROTEIN_ and that the rgs box plays a structural role in these processes . because our _METHOD_ analyses failed to identify phosphopeptides from the extreme c terminus of _PROTEIN_ we do not exclude additional phosphorylation sites in this region . however since we showed that the specific activity is moles phosphate per mole of _PROTEIN_ c terminal fragment additional phosphorylation sites would be mutually exclusive to the ones identified . we generated phospho specific _PROTEIN_ antibodies for immunoblot analysis . in arabidopsis seedlings lysates _PROTEIN_ tap was phosphorylated upon d _PROTEIN_ treatment . the phosphatase inhibitor calyculin a increased _PROTEIN_ phosphorylation even without d _PROTEIN_ suggesting that _PROTEIN_ undergoes steady state phosphorylation and dephosphorylation in plant cells . since phosphorylation of animal _PROTEIN_ is critical for their endocytosis we engineered a c terminal truncation mutant _PROTEIN_ and a full length _PROTEIN_ mutant in which three phosphorylation sites identified were mutated to alanine residues and assayed for d _PROTEIN_ dependent endocytosis . while the wild type _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was localized to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and endocytosed upon d _PROTEIN_ treatment the _PROTEIN_ mutant or _PROTEIN_ remained at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ with d _PROTEIN_ in both stable and transient _PROTEIN_ assays . while steady state levels of phosphorylated full length _PROTEIN_ increased with phosphatase inhibition by calyculin a no equivalent change was observed for the _PROTEIN_ mutant . these results indicate that the _PROTEIN_ terminus on _PROTEIN_ is the only phosphorylation region and that _PROTEIN_ terminal phosphorylation is required for _PROTEIN_ endocytosis . _PROTEIN_ is known to interact with the propeller protein which has a similar structure to the protein _PROTEIN_ . thus we hypothesized that _PROTEIN_ directly interacted with _PROTEIN_ as well . we found using purified components that _PROTEIN_ directly interacted with _PROTEIN_ in co precipitation experiments but _PROTEIN_ did not interact with _PROTEIN_ . using bifc analysis _PROTEIN_ strongly interacted with _PROTEIN_ at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ in both stable and transient assays although the majority of _PROTEIN_ was cytoplasmic . this indicates that the rate limiting _PROTEIN_ is the level of available dimer at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . fret analysis showed that _PROTEIN_ association with _PROTEIN_ increased upon treatment with d _PROTEIN_ . within minutes of stimulation the _PROTEIN_ associated with _PROTEIN_ at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ followed by the endosomes . the fret results suggest that the association of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ is triggered by induction of _PROTEIN_ causing initial interaction at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ continued with movement into endocytic compartments . _PROTEIN_ signaling through _PROTEIN_ is known to activate transcription of the _PROTEIN_ gene _PROTEIN_ and therefore _PROTEIN_ induced _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is used as a reporter of _PROTEIN_ dependent sugar signaling . we found that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in cells lacking _PROTEIN_ or both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ was at the basal level only of the _PROTEIN_ detected in wild type cells treated with d _PROTEIN_ . these results were consistent with our earlier finding that _PROTEIN_ is endocytosed in d _PROTEIN_ and minimally or not at all at lower concentration and less duration of d _PROTEIN_ . in the _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ double mutant cells acute d _PROTEIN_ treatment failed to stimulate _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ at the wild type level . loss of _PROTEIN_ attenuated _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ but loss of both _PROTEIN_ and completely abrogated sugar signaling as reported by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . sugar stimulated _PROTEIN_ endocytosis correlated with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . previously we identified a subset of genes that were induced by d _PROTEIN_ in an _PROTEIN_ independent manner _PROTEIN_ . to determine the role of _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ of these additional genes we quantified their induction following a brief acute treatment with d _PROTEIN_ . we found that induction of _PROTEIN_ dependent genes _PROTEIN_ were attenuated in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ . in contrast _PROTEIN_ independent genes were similarly induced in all genotypes . likewise the time course of d _PROTEIN_ stimulation and reset timing after starvation was unaffected in _PROTEIN_ null mutants . together these results suggest that sugar signals are mediated by several different _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ influence only the _PROTEIN_ dependent sugar signals . moreover these results suggest that atwnk mediated endocytosis of _PROTEIN_ is critical for activating g protein mediated sugar signaling . g protein signaling is involved in cell proliferation and elongation in arabidopsis seedlings _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . after days of etiolated growth _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ seedlings have shorter hypocotyls than wild type seedlings because of a reduction in cell proliferation _PROTEIN_ . on the other hand _PROTEIN_ plants and plants that _PROTEIN_ the constitutively active _PROTEIN_ have longer hypocotyls . a visual sugar phenotype of the g mutants is growth arrest and this also is a cell division phenomenon . we used the standard green seedling assay in conjunction with our sugar signaling assay to illustrate the role of the wnk kinases . shows that over a range of _PROTEIN_ sugar signaling is greatly attenuated in the _PROTEIN_ single and _PROTEIN_ double mutants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . loss of _PROTEIN_ alone slightly reduces signaling over time compared to wild type . sugar signaling as reported by _PROTEIN_ gene _PROTEIN_ correlates with the growth behavior on acute level of d _PROTEIN_ . growth arrest on _PROTEIN_ was more than for wild type yet only for the _PROTEIN_ double mutant and for the _PROTEIN_ single mutant . this was observed over a range of _PROTEIN_ concentrations . consistent with the loss of function mutations ectopic over _PROTEIN_ of either _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ confers the opposite effect _PROTEIN_ . the increased sensitivity to _PROTEIN_ conferred by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ requires the c terminus and/or the serines targeted for phosphorylation by _PROTEIN_ . the role of _PROTEIN_ induced _PROTEIN_ endocytosis fits the context of sugar induced growth arrest and also suggests that sugar signaling for this growth behavior originates at least in part at the endosome .
