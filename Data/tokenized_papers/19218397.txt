acyl coa synthetase genes are related to coumarate coa ligase but have distinct functions . the arabidopsis thaliana _PROTEIN_ protein is in clade a of arabidopsis acos proteins the clade most closely related to proteins . this clade contains putative nonperoxisomal acos enzymes conserved in several angiosperm lineages and in the moss physcomitrella patens . although its function is unknown _PROTEIN_ is preferentially _PROTEIN_ in the flowers of all _METHOD_ examined . here we show that an _PROTEIN_ mutant produced no pollen in mature anthers and no seeds by self fertilization and was severely compromised in pollen wall formation apparently lacking sporopollenin or exine . the phenotype was first evident at stage of anther development and correlated with maximum _PROTEIN_ mrna accumulation in tapetal cells at stages to . green _METHOD_ protein _PROTEIN_ fusions showed that _PROTEIN_ is located in the cytoplasm . recombinant _PROTEIN_ enzyme was active against oleic acid allowing kinetic constants for _PROTEIN_ substrates to be established . substrate competition assays indicated broad in vitro preference of the enzyme for medium chain fatty acids . we propose that _PROTEIN_ encodes an enzyme that participates in a conserved and ancient biochemical pathway required for sporopollenin monomer biosynthesis that may also include the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ enzymes .
previous results showed that the arabidopsis like gene _PROTEIN_ is a single copy gene with homologs in the genomes of representative fully sequenced land plants . to further clarify the relationship between _PROTEIN_ its homologs and true genes in plants we used the corresponding protein sequences from arabidopsis poplar rice the moss physcomitrella and tobacco to construct an unrooted maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree . in this phylogenetic reconstruction we included homologs from each of the plants examined and found that clade a acos genes form a distinct phylogenetic sister group to . in contrast with bona fide genes which have undergone complex patterns of gene family expansion in different lineages clade a acos proteins are encoded by single copy genes in each of the four species analyzed for which the complete genome sequences are available . also according to this analysis the physcomitrella clade a acos gene and the four physcomitrella sequences that encode proteins are basal to the angiosperm clade a acos genes and to angiosperm genes respectively . this suggests that both and clade a acos genes arose early in land plant evolution and were present in the most recent common ancestor of _METHOD_ and physcomitrella . consistent with this no clade a acos genes were found in the c. reinhardtii genome . putative _PROTEIN_ orthologs and _PROTEIN_ in other species unlike most other like acos proteins arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ and its homologs in other species do not contain recognizable peroxisomal targeting sequences of type at their c termini . to empirically test the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ we generated a yellow _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ tagged variant that was placed under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus promoter _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and transiently _PROTEIN_ this construct together with a reporter construct of a peroxisomal marker protein _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . red _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ localization in single arabidopsis epidermal cells was assayed by confocal laser scanning microscopy using appropriate filter sets for simultaneous and selective recording of _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ . while _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ cells displayed a punctate pattern typical of peroxisomal localization _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ localization did not coincide with this pattern instead _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was primarily restricted to the cytoplasm . this suggests that the _PROTEIN_ enzyme is localized to the cytoplasm . previous experiments showed that arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ has a flower preferred _PROTEIN_ pattern that the poplar homolog is _PROTEIN_ in male but not in female flowers and that the n. sylvestris homolog cl lk is _PROTEIN_ specifically in the tapetum of developing anthers . to explore the organ and cell type specific _PROTEIN_ pattern of _PROTEIN_ promoter sequences of variable length were fused to the _PROTEIN_ reporter gene and integrated into the arabidopsis genome . several independent transgenic lines homozygous for a single copy of the gus gene fusion were analyzed for gus activity . all lines yielded identical results and representative data are shown in figure . no gus _PROTEIN_ was observed in vegetative organs of seedlings and plants _METHOD_ . however gus _PROTEIN_ was first evident in young flower buds at developmental stages to according to citation where it was restricted specifically to the developing anthers . beyond stage gus _PROTEIN_ rapidly declined with no gus staining being detectable at anther maturity . we obtained an _PROTEIN_ transposon insertion line from the nottingham arabidopsis stock centre . within the segregating population plants homozygous for the _PROTEIN_ insertion allele _PROTEIN_ were identified by pcr genotyping and the location of the transposon insertion in the second exon of _PROTEIN_ was verified . we assayed _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ by rt pcr in both wild type and mutant flowers . using primers flanking the insertion site no _PROTEIN_ mrna could be detected in the mutant indicating that functional _PROTEIN_ mrna does not accumulate in the mutant and that _PROTEIN_ is likely to be a null allele of _PROTEIN_ . initial phenotypic analysis of the homozygous _PROTEIN_ plants suggested that the plants were self sterile since siliques failed to mature and produce seeds . careful examination of the mutant flowers revealed anthers that were apparently devoid of pollen grains . at a time when flowers of wild type plants grown in parallel had self pollinated and produced siliques with developing seeds development of _PROTEIN_ mutant flowers culminated in undeveloped siliques and complete absence of seed production . there were no other obvious morphological differences between the _PROTEIN_ mutant and wild type plants grown to maturity except that _PROTEIN_ mutant plants flowered for a longer time consistent with observations of other male sterile mutants . secondary wall formation and lignin deposition in anther endothecium cells is required for anther dehiscence and pollen release . given the close relationship between _PROTEIN_ and genes we considered the possibility that the enzyme encoded by _PROTEIN_ is required for lignin biosynthesis in the endothecium and that lack of lignification and anther dehiscence resulted in the loss of pollen release . to test this we treated anthers in developing wild type and _PROTEIN_ mutant flowers with phloroglucinol which stains lignin and other wall bound phenolics . however anthers from both wild type and _PROTEIN_ mutant plants stained equally well suggesting that there is no defect in lignin deposition in the mutant and that _PROTEIN_ activity is not required for lignin biosynthesis in the anther . to investigate the basis for the failure of self pollination in _PROTEIN_ mutant plants we used scanning electron microscopy to view anther development at higher resolution in wild type and mutant flowers . _PROTEIN_ mutant anthers underwent apparently normal development and dehiscence but no pollen grains could be observed either in dehiscent anthers or attached to stigmata by contrast abundant pollen was observed in dehiscing wild type anthers examined in parallel . the absence of pollen in _PROTEIN_ mutant flowers as observed by light or scanning electron microscopy indicates that _PROTEIN_ function is absolutely required for pollen maturation . when _PROTEIN_ mutant plants were used as pollen recipients in crosses with pollen from wild type plants siliques developed normally and produced seeds that germinated normally with no apparent loss in fecundity relative to self pollinated wild type plants . since only one insertional mutant line was available for _PROTEIN_ we allowed the heterozygote plants derived from the above cross to self pollinate to test the resulting population for cosegregation of the male sterile phenotype with _PROTEIN_ . in this population the male sterile mutant phenotype was inherited in a mendelian fashion with one quarter of the progeny displaying male sterility illustrating that the mutant phenotype is caused by a mutation at a single locus . next we determined the genotypes of plants . this analysis showed that the male sterile phenotype cosegregated with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . this strongly suggests that the male sterile phenotype and the complete block of pollen formation were caused by loss of function of the _PROTEIN_ gene . to test for the ability of the _PROTEIN_ gene to complement the male sterile phenotype in the _PROTEIN_ background we introduced an kb dna region from an arabidopsis wild type plant containing kb of the promoter sequence and the complete transcribed region of _PROTEIN_ into _PROTEIN_ heterozygote plants by agrobacterium tumefaciens mediated transformation . four lines harboring the _PROTEIN_ transgene were subjected to pcr aided genotyping and one was established as being _PROTEIN_ one as being _PROTEIN_ and two as being _PROTEIN_ . all plants were fully fertile suggesting that the introduced _PROTEIN_ transgene had complemented the _PROTEIN_ mutation in the two homozygous lines . we further determined the genotypes and phenotypes of progeny from each line that had inherited the _PROTEIN_ transgene _PROTEIN_ . for each line including the two that were homozygous for the _PROTEIN_ allele and gave rise only to _PROTEIN_ progeny all plants were fully fertile confirming the ability of _PROTEIN_ to complement the male sterile mutant phenotype . to identify the point at which pollen development was impaired in the _PROTEIN_ mutant we analyzed anther cross sections taken from wild type and _PROTEIN_ flowers at different stages of anther development as defined by citation . representative sections are shown in figure . early stages of anther development in _PROTEIN_ appeared normal . by stage in both mutant and wild type anthers four defined locules were established and visible pollen mother cells had appeared . subsequently the pollen mother cells underwent meiosis and tetrads were formed connected by a callose wall in both wild type and _PROTEIN_ plants . in both wild type and _PROTEIN_ mutant anthers individual microspores could be seen at stage indicating that the callose wall had degenerated releasing the microspores from the tetrads in a normal manner . at stage the wild type pollen grains became vacuolated and an exine wall started to become visible as evidenced by toluidine blue staining of the pollen grain walls . however normal development seemed to be arrested in the _PROTEIN_ mutant at this stage . although the _LOCATION_ were evident in some mutant microspores microspores appeared malformed and distorted in shape and exine walls were not as clearly evident as in the wild type . in place of the clearly developing microspores seen in the locules of wild type anthers stage mutant locules were filled with misshapen structures . during stage wild type pollen grains continued to enlarge and develop and the tapetum layer showed initial signs of degeneration . by contrast in the mutant anthers at an age equivalent to stage we observed degradation of both microspores and the tapetum . thus in the _PROTEIN_ mutant no developing pollen grains were observed at this stage and the tapetum degenerated earlier than in wild type plants . at stage the tapetal cell layer was greatly degraded in wild type anthers and clear darkly staining pollen grains were seen . by contrast although fully mature anthers appeared otherwise normal in the mutant the locules were empty devoid of pollen grains . these data suggest that the _PROTEIN_ male sterile phenotype is manifested relatively _PROTEIN_ in anther and microspore development at stages and when exine formation and sporopollenin deposition occur . to further pinpoint the stage of anther development defective in the _PROTEIN_ mutant we used transmission electron microscopy to gain higher resolution images of developing anthers in the _PROTEIN_ mutant and compared these to the corresponding images from wild type plants . figures to show that at stage characterized by the presence of tetrads that form after meiosis wild type and _PROTEIN_ mutant microspores were similar in morphology with characteristic callose walls . at this stage tapetal cells in the mutant appeared normal . at stage when free microspores had been released from tetrads following callose wall hydrolysis _METHOD_ deposition of a _PROTEIN_ sporopollenin containing exine on the nexine layer was evident in the wild type anthers . the exine had started to develop into a _PROTEIN_ reticulated wall characteristic of pollen grains residual primexine was visible in spaces of exine baculae which are characteristic of this stage and microspores were nonvacuolated . in comparison with the wild type free _PROTEIN_ mutant microspores at stage had a similar nonvacuolated morphology but contained thinner walls that were devoid of the pronounced reticulate exine wall seen in the wild type . in place of a well defined exine these microspores contained an amorphous substance adhering to the nexine that could be residual primexine or unpolymerized sporopollenin precursors . again tapetal cells at this stage appeared normal . at stage wild type pollen grains contained _PROTEIN_ reticulated exine walls and an intine layer . in stage of the _PROTEIN_ mutant many pollen grains were in various stages of lysis and degradation and had thin cell walls that were devoid of a characteristic exine layer but often retained amorphous wall material outside the intine and apparent nexine . in other cases relatively intact pollen grains were observed in _PROTEIN_ anthers at stage but in many cases pollen walls were completely devoid of wall material outside the intine . again tapetal cells in the _PROTEIN_ mutant anthers appeared normal at this stage suggesting that the defect in _PROTEIN_ pollen development is primarily due to the lack of sporopollenin deposition and exine formation rather than a general defect in tapetal cell development . this analysis pinpoints the defect in microspore development in the _PROTEIN_ mutant to the deposition of the sporopollenin rich exine wall at stages and of anther development while other aspects of anther development including tapetal cell development appear normal . to gain insight into the spatio temporal pattern of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in anthers we performed in situ hybridization using an _PROTEIN_ derived probe and developing wild type flowers . figure shows that _PROTEIN_ was strongly specifically and transiently _PROTEIN_ in the tapetal cell layer of developing anthers . at the beginning of stage locules with microspore mother cells and a distinct tapetum were evident but no hybridization signal was observed . toward the end of stage clear but relatively weak hybridization of the probe to the developing tapetum was detected . by stage which is characterized by the presence of tetrads within the locules maximal hybridization was seen in the tapetum . by stage during which microspores were released from tetrads hybridization to tapetal cells weakened and disappeared by stage . similarly gus reporter activity was restricted to the tapetum in transgenic lines harboring the bp gus fusion . collectively these results demonstrate that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is highly specific to tapetal cells and is highest in the stages immediately preceding the appearance of the visible phenotype at stage . the results are consistent with an _PROTEIN_ function in tapetal cells which are known to be the sites for the biosynthesis of sporopollenin precursors required for exine formation in developing microspores . we previously described the heterologous _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in escherichia coli and its application in a substrate/activity screen using an _PROTEIN_ depletion assay . among > potential substrates tested in vitro activity was observed only against several long chain fatty acids suggesting that _PROTEIN_ possibly functions as a fatty acyl coa synthetase . this activity was confirmed in vivo by the capacity of _PROTEIN_ to complement the deficient acyl coa synthetase in the e. coli _PROTEIN_ mutant by rescuing growth on oleic acid . further analysis showed that _PROTEIN_ could also rescue growth on saturated medium chain fatty acids of chain length to whereas _PROTEIN_ growth on shorter chain fatty acids was not supported . to extend these results we used a more sensitive radioactive assay to directly and unequivocally demonstrate activity of recombinant _PROTEIN_ against fatty acid substrates in vitro . when using labeled oleic acid as a substrate the affinity purified recombinant _PROTEIN_ protein displayed specific activities of coa ester formation ranging from to pkat/mg protein . although this activity is low it is comparable to that of other plant fatty acyl coa synthetases _PROTEIN_ in e. coli . furthermore activity was dependent on oleic acid coash _PROTEIN_ and native enzyme . the identity of the oleic acid coa ester product was verified by _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . the enzyme showed michaelis menten kinetics toward all of substrates and the derived kinetic parameters are listed in table . the km values in the low micromolar range for _PROTEIN_ substrates have also been reported for other acyl coa synthetases . kinetic properties of _PROTEIN_ to test for the in vitro preference of _PROTEIN_ for different fatty acid substrates we applied a competition assay which determined the conversion of oleic acid to the corresponding coa ester in the presence of other potential substrates that acted as competitors . as predicted addition of unlabeled oleic acid at concentrations of either or to the standard reaction mixes _PROTEIN_ the apparent rate of formation of the labeled reaction product to and respectively . among the saturated fatty acids _PROTEIN_ showed clear preference for those of medium chain length which competed nearly as well as oleic acid whereas fatty acids of longer or shorter chain length competed less efficiently . when hydroxy fatty acids differing in chain length and substitution pattern were compared large differences in competition activity were observed . among the hydroxy octanoic acids hydroxy octanoic acid competed better than oleic acid whereas and were as inactive as unsubstituted octanoic acid or dodecanolide which served as a negative control . thus the position of the hydroxyl group is critical for activity . among the long chain hydroxy fatty acids tested and were the most efficient competitors the latter exceeding the apparent effectiveness of oleic acid whereas medium chain hydroxy fatty acids were again less active . intriguingly the oxylipin opc impaired oleic acid conversion quite efficiently whereas none of the hydroxycinnamic acids were effective above control values with the possible exception of caffeic acid . we confirmed the ability of _PROTEIN_ to generate coa esters of the hydroxylated fatty acids and by _METHOD_ spectrometric analysis of coa esters formed in vitro by incubation of _PROTEIN_ with the corresponding acids . from these results we conclude that _PROTEIN_ is a medium to long chain fatty acyl coa synthetase with a preference for substituted fatty acids carrying a hydroxy group at position to whereas activity as a can be dismissed .
