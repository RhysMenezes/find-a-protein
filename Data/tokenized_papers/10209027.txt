pollen tube cells elongate based on actin dependent targeted secretion at the tip . rho family small _PROTEIN_ have been implicated in the regulation of related processes in animal and yeast cells . we have functionally characterized rac type rho family proteins that are _PROTEIN_ in growing pollen tubes . _PROTEIN_ of dominant negative rac inhibited pollen tube elongation whereas _PROTEIN_ of constitutive active rac induced depolarized growth . pollen tube rac was found to accumulate at the tip _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and to physically associate with a phosphatidylinositol monophosphate kinase activity . phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate the product of ptdins p ks showed a similar intracellular localization as rac . _PROTEIN_ of the pleckstrin homology domain of phospholipase c which binds specifically to ptdins inhibited pollen tube elongation . these results indicate that rac and ptdins act in a common pathway to control _PROTEIN_ pollen tube growth and provide direct evidence for a function of ptdins compartmentalization in the regulation of this process .
previously we reported the cloning of at which was identified in a screen for a. thaliana cdnas that cause morphological changes when _PROTEIN_ in yeast . using at as a probe at _PROTEIN_ was isolated from an a. thaliana cdna library . the corresponding genomic sequences were cloned by screening an a. thaliana library with at or at _PROTEIN_ cdna probes . genomic sequences upstream of the at and at _PROTEIN_ orfs including the ends of adjacent orfs and the entire at rac untranslated regions were fused to a cdna encoding gus . transgenic a. thaliana lines containing the resulting at or at _PROTEIN_ promoter gus fusion constructs _PROTEIN_ were generated and histochemically analyzed for gus _PROTEIN_ . four independent lines transformed with at _PROTEIN_ gus showed gus _PROTEIN_ confined to pollen to growing pollen tubes to _PROTEIN_ and to a small region of the vascular tissue below the cotyledons . in contrast six lines transformed with at gus were all found to _PROTEIN_ gus in the vascular tissues of all organs . only one of these lines showed a weak gus _PROTEIN_ in pollen . gus is known to be a stable protein with a slow turnover rate in plant cells . to confirm that gus activity detected in transgenic pollen tubes resulted at least partially from gene _PROTEIN_ during pollen germination and tube growth promoter gus fusion constructs were also transiently _PROTEIN_ in growing tobacco pollen tubes . under these conditions the at _PROTEIN_ promoter was found to confer strong gus _PROTEIN_ at a level similar to that obtained with the pollen specific promoter . no gus _PROTEIN_ was observed in pollen tubes transiently transfected with at gus or with a control construct containing a cdna encoding _METHOD_ fused to the promoter . these results indicate that at _PROTEIN_ but not at is preferentially _PROTEIN_ in pollen and in growing pollen tubes . at and at _PROTEIN_ encode proteins of kd that show high homology to human . recombinant at and at _PROTEIN_ were both found to bind and to hydrolyze _PROTEIN_ confirming that the two proteins are indeed functional small _PROTEIN_ . they belong to a large family of rac like proteins with unknown or poorly characterized cellular functions whose genes have been cloned recently from different plant species . the protein sequences of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ two a. thaliana rac like proteins that share very high sequence homology with at _PROTEIN_ are shown in fig . . interestingly _PROTEIN_ has been shown to be _PROTEIN_ in pollen and was proposed to have a function in the regulation of pollen tube growth . we found that in situ analysis of at _PROTEIN_ function in cultured a. thaliana pollen tubes is not feasible . these cells elongate slowly show severe morphological abnormalities and cease growing only a few hours after germination . by contrast tobacco pollen tubes can grow rapidly and morphologically normal in vitro for up to h . methods have been established that allow analysis of transient gene _PROTEIN_ in cultured tobacco pollen tubes after gene transfer into germinating pollen grains by particle bombardment . we have used these methods along with biochemical techniques to study the function of at _PROTEIN_ and its tobacco homologues in the regulation of pollen tube growth . an antibody raised against at was found to have similar affinities to recombinant at and at _PROTEIN_ . immunoblot analysis showed that in tobacco pollen tube extracts at rac binds to at least one protein with an apparent molecular _METHOD_ of kd which corresponds to the size of rac . clostridium difficile toxin b is known to _PROTEIN_ and thereby inactivate specifically mammalian rho family proteins including rac _PROTEIN_ . treatment with tcdb and udp _PROTEIN_ resulted in _PROTEIN_ and labeling of recombinant at _PROTEIN_ showing that plant rac homologues can serve as substrates of this toxin . radiolabeled proteins of kd were detected in tobacco pollen tube extracts assayed for _PROTEIN_ by tcdb but not in control samples treated with udp _PROTEIN_ alone . to investigate whether the detected pollen tube tcdb targets are recognized by at rac proteins interacting with this antibody were immunoprecipitated from tobacco pollen tube extracts assayed for _PROTEIN_ by tcdb . in these experiments at least one kd pollen tube protein _PROTEIN_ by tcdb was found to interact with at rac and was therefore identified as an at _PROTEIN_ homologue . no radiolabeled proteins were precipitated from assayed extracts treated with preimmune serum . a cdna encoding the catalytic domain of tcdb _PROTEIN_ was transiently _PROTEIN_ under the control of the promoter in tobacco pollen tubes . _METHOD_ emitted by coexpressed _METHOD_ was used to identify successfully targeted pollen tubes among an excess of untransformed _METHOD_ tubes . transient _PROTEIN_ of marker genes did not affect pollen tube growth . control pollen tubes transfected with _PROTEIN_ vectors containing _METHOD_ and gus coding sequences fused to the promoter showed normal morphology and elongated at the same rate as untransformed pollen tubes . by contrast transient _PROTEIN_ of the catalytic domain of tcdb clearly inhibited tobacco pollen tube growth . together these results indicate that tobacco pollen tubes contain at least one at _PROTEIN_ homologue with an essential function in tube elongation . the function and the intracellular localization of ras related small _PROTEIN_ can be predictably altered by introducing specific mutations in conserved domains _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . sequences encoding wild type and mutant _METHOD_ of at _PROTEIN_ were transiently _PROTEIN_ in growing tobacco pollen tubes under the control of the promoter . coexpression of _METHOD_ was used to identify targeted tubes . _PROTEIN_ of dominant negative at _PROTEIN_ strongly inhibited pollen tube extension . after reaching a total length of several at _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ pollen tubes stopped elongating . by contrast _PROTEIN_ of constitutive active _PROTEIN_ at _PROTEIN_ or at _PROTEIN_ caused germinating pollen tubes to form large spherical balloons instead of elongating tubes . apparently a complete loss of _PROTEIN_ of cell extension was induced . wild type at _PROTEIN_ had similar although somewhat weaker effects . after germination pollen tubes elongated normally for a short while before tips started to form balloons . the balloons often had irregular shapes instead of being spherical presumably because the potential for _PROTEIN_ growth was not completely abolished . at _PROTEIN_ lacking the _PROTEIN_ terminal consensus prenylation domain known to be required for the _LOCATION_ association of ras related proteins still induced depolarized tip growth but was clearly less effective than wild type at _PROTEIN_ . these results demonstrate a key role of at _PROTEIN_ homologous proteins in the regulation of _PROTEIN_ pollen tube growth and indicate that _LOCATION_ localization is essential for their activity . the best characterized function of rho family proteins in animal and yeast cells is the regulation of actin organization _PROTEIN_ . therefore effects of transient _PROTEIN_ of mutant at _PROTEIN_ on the tobacco pollen tube actin _LOCATION_ were examined . _PROTEIN_ at _PROTEIN_ or at _PROTEIN_ were coexpressed in pollen tubes with a _METHOD_ mouse talin fusion protein which we have shown to label plant actin filaments in vivo in a specific and noninvasive manner . the actin _LOCATION_ in normally growing tobacco pollen tubes consists of _PROTEIN_ longitudinally oriented actin bundles in the shank and fine filamentous structures close to the tip . an excessive number of _PROTEIN_ actin cables arranged in a helical pattern was observed in balloons formed by _PROTEIN_ at _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ pollen tubes . _PROTEIN_ of constitutive active at _PROTEIN_ apparently induced actin polymerization or bundling and possibly reorientation of actin cables in the pollen tube tip . by contrast actin bundles in pollen tubes _PROTEIN_ dominant negative at _PROTEIN_ were generally finer and less organized than in control tubes indicating that inhibition of pollen tube rac activity may reduce actin bundling . as in other cell types one of the functions of pollen tube rac appears to be the regulation of the actin _LOCATION_ . analysis of pollen tube extracts revealed that a significant portion of the kd tobacco pollen tube protein that interacts with the at rac antibody cofractionates with _LOCATION_ whereas the majority of the protein remains in the cytoplasmic fraction . a similar distribution of radiolabeled protein with the same size was observed when pollen tube extracts assayed for _PROTEIN_ by tcdb were fractionated . in control experiments pollen tube actin showed a typical distribution between cytoplasmic and _LOCATION_ fractions . to investigate the intracellular localization of pollen tube rac in more detail sequences encoding wild type and mutant _METHOD_ of at _PROTEIN_ fused to the _PROTEIN_ terminus of _METHOD_ were transiently _PROTEIN_ in tobacco pollen tubes under the control of the promoter . a _METHOD_ cdna was also _PROTEIN_ from the same promoter . although somewhat weaker effects of _PROTEIN_ the fusion proteins on pollen tube growth were very similar to those observed with untagged wild type or mutant at _PROTEIN_ . this indicates that the fusion proteins were functional and that analysis of their localization provided relevant information on the intracellular distribution of pollen tube rac proteins . tobacco pollen tubes _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ fused to different _METHOD_ of at _PROTEIN_ were examined by confocal microscopy . _METHOD_ was found to be evenly distributed in the pollen tube cytoplasm . confocal optical sections through pollen tubes _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fused to constitutive active or to wild type at _PROTEIN_ revealed that these fusion proteins accumulated at the cell cortex exclusively in the tube tip indicating that they associated with the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ specifically in this pollen tube region . the rest of the fusion proteins was evenly distributed in the cytoplasm . _METHOD_ fused to at _PROTEIN_ did not show _LOCATION_ association and was localized to the cytoplasm similar to _METHOD_ . in summary the results described here indicate that at _PROTEIN_ homologues localize specifically to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ at the pollen tube tip and confirm that the _PROTEIN_ terminal prenylation domain is essential for their proper localization and function . ptdins p ks and ptdins were identified as effectors of mammalian rho family small _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . rac and rho both in the _PROTEIN_ and in the gdp bound conformation have been demonstrated to physically interact with ptdins p k activity in mammalian cell extracts . we have tested the possibility that ptdins p ks and ptdins act as rac effectors also in pollen tubes . experiments were performed to investigate whether at _PROTEIN_ and its tobacco homologues bind to ptdins p k activity present in tobacco pollen tube extracts . recombinant at _PROTEIN_ fused to the _PROTEIN_ terminus of _PROTEIN_ was loaded with the nonhydrolyzable nucleotide analogues _PROTEIN_ or . proteins interacting with nucleotide bound _PROTEIN_ at _PROTEIN_ were purified from tobacco pollen tube extracts and assayed for lipid kinase activity using _PROTEIN_ and a mix of phosphoinositides as substrates . an excess of _PROTEIN_ was used in control experiments . labeled lipids produced in kinase assays were analyzed by tlc and autoradiography . fig . a shows that significant amounts of radiolabeled ptdins were synthesized when proteins associated with _PROTEIN_ or loaded _PROTEIN_ at _PROTEIN_ were assayed whereas minimal levels of ptdins production were detected in _PROTEIN_ control samples . similar results were obtained when purified ptdins p was used as a substrate instead of a mixture of phosphoinositides or when proteins coimmunoprecipitated with at _PROTEIN_ homologues from tobacco pollen tube extracts by the at rac antibody were assayed . the different ptdins _METHOD_ identified to date in plant and/or animal cells including ptdins ptdins and ptdins _PROTEIN_ are difficult to separate on tlc plates . therefore labeled lipid products of kinase binding assay performed as described above using a mix of phosphoinositides as substrates were deacylated and subjected to hplc . under conditions that allow clear separation of deacylated ptdins _METHOD_ labeled deacylated assay products coeluted from hplc columns with labeled gropins used as a standard . the described results demonstrate that recombinant at _PROTEIN_ both in the _PROTEIN_ and in the gdp bound conformation as well as at least one of its tobacco homologues physically associates with tobacco pollen tube ptdins p k activity which synthesizes specifically ptdins . the isolated ph domain of plc has been shown to bind ptdins integrated into lipid _LOCATION_ specifically and with high affinity both in vitro and in vivo . under the control of the promoter a sequence encoding a plc ph domain _METHOD_ fusion protein _METHOD_ was transiently _PROTEIN_ in tobacco pollen tubes . consistent with a key role of ptdins in the regulation of pollen tube growth moderate levels of _METHOD_ plc ph _PROTEIN_ were sufficient to strongly inhibit tobacco pollen germination and tube growth . only weakly _METHOD_ _METHOD_ plc ph _PROTEIN_ pollen tubes were able to grow normally . _METHOD_ emitted by these pollen tubes was too weak to be visible on micrographs like the one shown in fig . a. confocal optical sections through such pollen tubes revealed that _METHOD_ plc ph accumulated at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ in the tube tip . although _METHOD_ plc ph appeared to label a somewhat smaller area its localization in tobacco pollen tubes was strikingly similar to that of transiently _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ at _PROTEIN_ fusion proteins . pollen tubes with _METHOD_ plc ph labeling as shown in fig . e were indistinguishable from untransformed control tubes in _METHOD_ of morphology and growth rate _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ demonstrating that the observed localization of the fusion protein provides information on a physiologically normal situation . a number of control experiments supported the view that the specific interaction of _METHOD_ plc ph with ptdins caused inhibition of pollen tube growth and was responsible for the localization of the fusion protein to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ at the tip . the free amino group of the lysine residue at position in the plc ph domain has been shown to form a direct hydrogen bond to the phosphate of ptdins _PROTEIN_ . replacement of this basic lysine residue by neutral leucine or even by glutamic acid was demonstrated to abolish the ability of plc to bind ptdins in _LOCATION_ . neither _METHOD_ plc ph nor _METHOD_ plc ph detectably accumulated at the tip _LOCATION_ when transiently _PROTEIN_ in tobacco pollen tubes . whereas high level _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ plc ph still severely inhibited pollen tube growth even brightly _METHOD_ tubes _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ plc ph could elongate rapidly and showed an essentially normal morphology . the ph domain of arno has been demonstrated to bind with a high degree of specificity to ptdins _PROTEIN_ a lipid that has not been identified in plant cells to date . transient _PROTEIN_ from the promoter of a cdna sequence encoding the arno ph domain fused to _METHOD_ did not significantly affect tobacco pollen tube growth . no accumulation of the _METHOD_ arno ph fusion protein at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ was observed . these results provide strong evidence for an essential function of ptdins in pollen tube elongation . rac proteins which physically interact with ptdins synthesizing ptdins p k activity and ptdins both localize to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ at the pollen tube tip . this suggests that rac proteins ptdins p k activity and ptdins act together in a common pathway to regulate _PROTEIN_ pollen tube growth .
