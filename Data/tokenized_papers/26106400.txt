the burp domain is a plant specific domain that has been identified in secretory proteins and some of these are involved in cell wall modification . the tomato polygalacturonase i complex involved in pectin degradation in ripening fruits has a non catalytic subunit that has a burp domain . this protein is called polygalacturonase beta _PROTEIN_ and the arabidopsis genome encodes three proteins that exhibit strong amino acid similarities with _PROTEIN_ ? we generated arabidopsis lines in which _PROTEIN_ levels of atpgls are altered in order to investigate the biological roles of the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ like proteins . among the three atpgls exhibited the highest transcriptional activity throughout all developmental stages . atpgl triple mutant plants have smaller rosette leaves than those of wild type plants because the leaf cells are smaller in the mutant plants . interestingly when we overexpressed using a promoter leaf cells in transgenic plants grew larger than those of the wild type . a c terminal _METHOD_ fusion protein of complemented phenotypes of the triple mutant plants and it localized to the cell wall . a truncated _METHOD_ fusion protein lacking the burp domain failed to rescue the mutant phenotypes even though the _METHOD_ protein was targeted to the cell wall indicating that the burp domain is required for the protein 's effect on cell expansion . quantitative rt pcr and immunoblot analyses indicated that the expansin gene is up regulated in the overexpressor plants . taken together these results indicate that is an apoplastic burp domain protein playing a role in cell expansion .
we identified three open reading frames in the arabidopsis genome that encode proteins with significant amino acid sequence identity to the tomato subunit . these arabidopsis proteins and share

of each primer set using semi qrt pcr of total rna samples from t dna inserted mutant lines of the three genes . atpgls are highly _PROTEIN_ in flowers and _METHOD_ in mature arabidopsis plants . atpgl transcript levels were measured high in seedlings at days after germination but were barely detectable in six dag seedlings . transcriptional activities of and were times lower than those of in all tissues that we examined indicating that is the most highly transcribed member of the family . _PROTEIN_ profiles of the atpgl genes obtained from the genevestigator database were consistent with our qrt pcr results . to determine cell and tissue specific _PROTEIN_ patterns of we generated transgenic lines containing an promoter plus bacterial uida _PROTEIN_ translational fusion construct gus . the promoter utilized in the _PROTEIN_ gus reporter construct was sufficient to control the _PROTEIN_ of for molecular complementation of the atpgl triple knockout mutant . eight gus transformed lines were examine to determine tissue specific promoter activities by gus staining . gus activity was detected in trichomes and guard cells in seedling leaves . gus staining was not detected in the shoot apical meristem but weak staining was observed in expanding leaves . the vascular tissue in the leaves did not exhibit any gus staining but vascular tissue in the root was strongly stained . epidermal cells of roots including the root hairs were positive for gus staining analogous to the trichomes and guard cells of the aerial tissues . pollen sacs sepals and styles of pistils exhibited

plants in which all three atpgl genes were disrupted by t dna insertions . we acquired mutant lines of each atpgl gene from the salk t dna collections . the t dna lines were backcrossed to the wild type col three times and homozygous lines of and were isolated . homozygous and homozygous mutant lines did not exhibit any phenotypic defect throughout their life cycle . the double homozygous mutant plants were also indistinguishable from wt plants . to generate triple mutant lines in which all three atpgls were inactivated we crossed the double homozygous line to the single mutant plants . inactivation of all three atpgl genes was verified in triple mutant plants by pcr genotypic analysis and by rt pcr . the triple mutant plants produced leaves and petioles that were smaller than those of wt seedlings when germinated on soil and grown side by side . sizes of single homozygous plants were slightly reduced when compared with sizes of wt plants . disruption of functional copies of and amplified the size reduction phenotype suggesting that the functions of these genes overlap . it was observed that the tko mutant plants produced less numbers of rosette leaves than wild type plants did from days after germination . around days after germination similar numbers of rosette leaves were seen in tko mutant plants . mature rosette leaves are always smaller in tko mutant plants than in wild type plants irrespective of plants developmental stages . the size differences in the single homozygous mutant plants and the tko triple mutant plants were not observed if the mutant plants were

of leaf epidermal cells by microscopic observation of epidermal peels . surface areas of individual epidermal cells in wild type leaves averaged while epidermal cells of tko leaves had an average surface area of . to compare cell sizes in the leaf parenchyma tissue we prepared semi thin sections of wild type and tko leaves and measured average areas of cross sections of epidermal cells and of palisade cells . the tko leaves contained smaller epidermal and palisade cells than did those of the wild type . these results were consistent with the leaf cell size differences observed in _PROTEIN_

oe was determined by student 's t test . p < p < . a construct with cdna along with its kb native promoter was introduced into the triple mutant . the construct rescued the phenotype of cell size reduction in the triple mutant . recently a cotton protein homologous to the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ burp domain protein _PROTEIN_ was shown to promote cell elongation in the cotton fiber . however when we compared homozygous t dna inserted mutant plants of _PROTEIN_ with wild type plants the mutant plants did not show any sign of inhibited cell expansion . to test whether is directly involved in cell growth we produced transgenic lines in which is overexpressed by a camv promoter . rt pcr analysis indicated that transcript levels of are approximately three times higher in the transgenic plants than in wild type plants . the high levels of resulted in plants with larger leaves and longer petioles than those of wild type plants . when the cell sizes in epidermal layers were measured by epidermal peels their average size was larger than the average epidermal cell size in wild type leaves . the mesophyll cells beneath the epidermal layer were also observed in semi thin sections to be enlarged relative to those in the wild type . even though activity of the promoter is strong in trichomes and in guard cells these specialized epidermal cells in the tko triple mutant line or in the oe overexpressor line did not exhibit any size differences relative to those in wild type leaves . to localize the protein we generated arabidopsis plants _PROTEIN_ fused with _METHOD_ at its c terminus . the _METHOD_ fusion protein was _PROTEIN_ under the kb native promoter and this _METHOD_ protein complemented phenotypes associated with inactivation of the in tko triple mutant plants . _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was detected in trichomes and in guard cells in agreement with the gus promoter activity assay . _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was also observed in the leaf epidermal cells where it overlapped with cell wall specific _METHOD_ from propidium iodide . to determine subcellular localization of _METHOD_ we performed immunogold labeling of the _METHOD_ transgenic line cells with an anti _METHOD_ antibody . the immunogold particles were seen in the cell walls of trichome cells and of leaf epidermal cells . the _METHOD_ specific gold particles were scattered randomly over the epidermal cell wall suggesting that is secreted into the apoplast . transformation of tko with _METHOD_ and with _METHOD_ . twenty eight day old wild type tko complemented with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ tko mutant and tko

mature form in ripening tomatoes does not contain the burp domain suggesting that the domain is cleaved when is secreted to the cell wall . to test whether the burp domain of is removed we performed immunoblot analyses of protein extracts from tko mutant plants that were rescued by _METHOD_ . a polypeptide of kda was recognized by the _METHOD_ antibody from the triple mutant complemented by _METHOD_ . the kda polypeptide matches the full length protein combined with _METHOD_ indicating that the functional _METHOD_ fusion protein contains the burp domain . to test whether the burp domain is needed for the _METHOD_ protein to rescue tko we prepared a new construct in which the burp domain of was removed and the truncated was fused with _METHOD_ . the construct failed to restore tko back to the wild type size although we were able to detect the fusion protein by immunoblot analysis and by confocal microscopy imaging . these results suggest that the burp domain of is critical for 's role in cell growth . genes encoding proteins in a same pathway are often transcriptionally co regulated . to identify genes that are functionally related to we searched the _PROTEIN_ database that quantitatively predicts candidates for interacting partner proteins based on transcriptional correlations published experimental results and other parameters . because we are interested in genes whose _PROTEIN_ is linked to _PROTEIN_ the prediction was made exclusively based on evidence of coexpression . _PROTEIN_ had the highest confidence score of followed by _PROTEIN_ that had a confidence score of . _PROTEIN_ is an expansin that might be functionally associated with the cell enlargement effect of . therefore we examined _PROTEIN_ levels of _PROTEIN_ in smaller and larger rosette leaf samples from the tko triple mutant and from the overexpressor line plants by qrt pcr and immunoblot analyses . arabidopsis has expansins _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ is closely related to _PROTEIN_ . they share amino acid sequence identity . because _PROTEIN_ specific antibody is not available we utilized an antibody generated with _PROTEIN_ to estimate protein levels of _PROTEIN_ . transcription levels of _PROTEIN_ are reduced in the triple mutant samples but are increased in the samples from overexpressor plants suggesting that _PROTEIN_ is involved in the cell size differences in the two transgenic lines . in the immunoblot analyses using the anti antibody the amount of expansin polypeptides is increased in the enlarged leaves of overexpressor plants . however the triple mutant leaves have as much expansin polypeptides as the wt leaves probably because the anti _PROTEIN_ antibody recognizes expansins other than _PROTEIN_ . qrt pcr and immunoblot analyses of _PROTEIN_ in the transgenic lines . a network view from the search of genes coexpressed with using the confidence threshold value of from the _PROTEIN_ ver . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in the network corresponds to . beneath the network is a table showing the input gene _PROTEIN_ the prediction from coexpression datasets and confidence scores . transcript levels of _PROTEIN_ measured by qrt pcr and levels of expansins estimated by immunoblot analysis . rosette leaf samples from day old wild type triple mutant and overexpressor plants were examined . amounts of expansins were approximated by polypeptide intensities in the blots and normalized with amounts of _LOCATION_ fructose bisphosphatase in the same samples . qrt pcr and immunoblot analyses were performed with samples from six different plants . a representative immunoblot of the three genotypes with the anti antibody .
