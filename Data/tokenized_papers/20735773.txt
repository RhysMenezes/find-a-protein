_METHOD_ tagging of proteins and confocal imaging techniques have become methods of choice in analysing the distributions and dynamic characteristics of proteins at the subcellular level . in common use are a number of strategies for transient _PROTEIN_ that greatly reduce the preparation time in advance of imaging but their applications are limited in success outside a few tractable species and tissues . we previously developed a simple method to transiently _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ tagged proteins in arabidopsis root epidermis and root hairs . we describe here a set of gateway compatable vectors with _METHOD_ tags incorporating the ubiqutin gene promoter of arabidopsis that gives prolonged _PROTEIN_ of the _METHOD_ tagged proteins both in tobacco and arabidopsis tissues after transient transformation and is equally useful in generating stably transformed lines . as a proof of principle we carried out transformations with _METHOD_ markers for the integral _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ protein _PROTEIN_ a member of the snare family of vesicle trafficking proteins and for _PROTEIN_ a _LOCATION_ protein that facilitates the scavenging of reactive oxygen species . we also carried out transformations with _PROTEIN_ and its interacting partner the _PROTEIN_ k channel to demonstrate the utility of the methods in bimolecular _METHOD_ complementation . transient transformations of arabidopsis using agrobacterium co cultivation methods yielded _PROTEIN_ in all epidermal cells including root hairs and guard cells . comparative studies showed that the promoter gives similar levels of _PROTEIN_ to that driven by the native _PROTEIN_ promoter faithfully reproducing the characteristics of protein distributions at the subcellular level . unlike the driven construct _PROTEIN_ under the promoter remained elevated for periods in excess of weeks after transient transformation . this toolbox of vectors and _METHOD_ tags promises significant advantages for the study of _LOCATION_ dynamics and cellular development as well as events associated with environmental stimuli in guard cells and nutrient acquisition in roots .
the gateway compatible pub dest vector set was designed to enable both n and c terminal fusions of proteins of interest with several fluorophores including _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ the bimolecular _METHOD_ complementation components _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ as well as the photoconvertible eos _METHOD_ protein . these binary vectors incorporated the nucleotide sequence corresponding to the first base pairs of the promoter immediately upstream of the ubiquitin gene from arabidopsis . they also included sequences encoding phosphinothricin n acetyltransferase and aminoglycoside adenyltransferase for resistance to basta or hygromycin in the plant and to streptomycin and spectinomycin in escherichia coli respectively . to determine the efficiency of transformation and to characterize _PROTEIN_ we made use both of immunochemical methods and confocal laser scanning microscopy . the analysis was based in part on comparative measurements with the same vectors incorporating the standard promoter both in tobacco and in arabidopsis after transient transformations . for this purpose we used two markers the arabidopsis snare protein _PROTEIN_ an integral _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ protein that is known to _PROTEIN_ throughout the plant and overlaps functionally with its tobacco homologue and the arabidopsis dehydroascorbate reductase _PROTEIN_ a redoxin that is found primarily in the _LOCATION_ but has also been associated with _LOCATION_ . we also carried out analyses using bifc constructs of _PROTEIN_ and its interacting partner the k channel _PROTEIN_ . as described below the analysis also summarizes standardized parameters for co cultivation of arabidopsis with agrobacterium tumefaciens that give consistent and prolonged _PROTEIN_ of fusion proteins in root hypocotyl shoot and cotyledon epidermis as well as in guard cells of arabidopsis seedlings . bacterial preparation proved an important determinant for the efficient transformation and _PROTEIN_ both of tobacco and arabidopsis . we compared the relative efficiency of transformation with agrobacterium tumefaciens harvested from liquid culture following a single h growth cycle and following a subculture cycle for an additional h period after the bacteria were diluted in fresh medium fllowing the method of citation before harvesting . after harvest and pre treatment with acetosyringone agrobacterium carrying _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ fusion constructs were infiltrated into tobacco leaves and co cultivated with day old arabidopsis seedlings in half strength _METHOD_ salts plus sylwet as described previously . the concentration of agrobacterium used for injections and in co cultivation proved to have no measurable effect on transformation efficiency whereas increasing the ph of the co cultivation medium especially promoted transformation and _PROTEIN_ much as we reported previously for agrobacterium rhizogenes mediated transformation by contrast the _METHOD_ signals were enhanced between three and five fold when the bacteria were passed through the additional subculture cycle and we therefore standardized conditions based on this method with a final of and ph of that yielded over transformation effciency of arabidopsis with agrobacterium tumefaciens . differences associated with the and promoters were most notable in construct _PROTEIN_ in tobacco . quantified on the basis of _METHOD_ yield leaf infiltrations of tobacco with agrobacterium carrying the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ construct gave roughly fold greater signal driven by the promoter compared with the same construct under control however this difference in _METHOD_ signals was greatly attenuated when _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis . the difference between tobacco and arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ was confirmed by western blot analysis showing the presence of the doublet of bands recognized by polyclonal antibodies to _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ under both promoters the vesicle trafficking protein showed a strong _METHOD_ associated with the cell periphery consistent with its known localization to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ where it facilitates the final stages of _LOCATION_ fusion between vesicle and target _LOCATION_ as well as controlling channel mediated k transport . we noted in every case the absence of any appreciable _METHOD_ from internal structures with driven _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ under the promoter _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was frequently associated with mobile punctate structures in the _LOCATION_ and occasionally with the _LOCATION_ in tobacco . these latter observations are consistent with retention in the secretory pathway and may indicate the formation of inclusion bodies associated with the high levels of driven _PROTEIN_ . this interpretation was supported by _METHOD_ bleaching experiments that showed a pronounced mobility of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ within cells when _PROTEIN_ under the control of the promoter but not under control . the _PROTEIN_ construct exhibited prolonged transgene _PROTEIN_ that remained substantially elevated even weeks after transformation both in tobacco and arabidopsis when driven by the promoter . under our standardized conditions the _METHOD_ yield for _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ reached a maxiumum independent of the promoter approximately h after adding the bacteria . _PROTEIN_ remained essentially stable thereafter for the driven construct but decayed significantly after days when driven by the promoter whether _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis or in tobacco . analysis of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ led to a similar conclusion . finally we noted that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ under control compared favourably with that of the _PROTEIN_ transgene when stably _PROTEIN_ and driven by its own promoter _PROTEIN_ although transcriptional analyses suggest a fold enhancement would be expected with the driven construct . indeed translational and post translational _PROTEIN_ are likely to contribute to the temporal characteristics of transgene _PROTEIN_ . thus the similarity in _METHOD_ yields in this case is fortuitous . nonetheless we suspect that the moderate activity of the driven system means that its control of _PROTEIN_ is less prone to gene silencing over time . co cultivation of arabidopsis seedlings and agrobacterium with t dna carrying _METHOD_ transgene fusions invariably led to the transformation of the root tissues hypocotyl stem and cotyledons . within these tissues transformation was limited to the outer cell layer much as was reported previously indicating that all cells exposed to the agrobacterium culture during co cultivation are subject to transformation . figure illustrates results typical of transformations with driven _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and its distribution in the root epidermis as well as the advantages for confocal image analysis of _PROTEIN_ in a tissue that shows little or no background _METHOD_ . driven by the promoter _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was observed along the length of the root both in epidermal cell files forming root hairs and those that did not . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was strongest however at the base of trichoblasts and at the tips of root hairs especially younger presumably still growing root hairs . analysis of individual root hairs showed the _METHOD_ to be associated with the cell periphery not with the _LOCATION_ or tonoplast and we noted the absence of any appreciable _METHOD_ from internal structures . furthermore _PROTEIN_ showed little evidence of mobility within individual root hairs consistent with its situation as an integral _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ protein . in the latter case we used _METHOD_ recovery after photobleaching and _METHOD_ lifetime in photobleaching experiments to assess _PROTEIN_ movement of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ when _PROTEIN_ in root hairs and we repeated these measurements with experiments using _PROTEIN_ eos to follow the dynamics of the snare after photoactivation of the photochromic eos protein . using _METHOD_ yield we compared the driven _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ with that of the snare when stably _PROTEIN_ and driven by its own promoter _PROTEIN_ . under _PROTEIN_ control _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ has been reported throughout the vegetative plant especially in epidermal tissues of leaves _METHOD_ the root and root hairs . within the root epidermis and root hairs we found the promoter to faithfully reproduce the protein distribution with _PROTEIN_ driven by the _PROTEIN_ promoter . in each case the fluorophore tag was strongest at the basal end of trichoblasts and at the tips of younger root hairs . we noted a pronounced elevation in _METHOD_ around the dome of the root hair that dropped off steeply within the first of the tip apex . quantified on the basis of peripheral _METHOD_ at the apex relative to the base of the root hair _PROTEIN_ showed the greatest difference in its distribution in root hairs shorter than with the _METHOD_ ratio declining to approximately in root hairs longer than irrespective of the promoter driving _PROTEIN_ . the same distribution was reflected in _METHOD_ _METHOD_ following driven _PROTEIN_ of the bifc partners fused with _PROTEIN_ with the k channel subunit _PROTEIN_ . this enhanced localization to the root hair tip suggests a corresponding spatial distribution to the channel and snare functionalities and may bear on their roles in k nutrition . finally it is of particular interest that our use of the promoter and the strategies based on co cultivation also lead to transient transformation of stomatal guard cells in arabidopsis . in the past studies of protein dynamics in guard cells have been hampered by the recalcitrance of this cell type to transient transformation by agrobacterium leaving biolistic methods as the only alternative . figure shows _PROTEIN_ eos _PROTEIN_ in epidermal and guard cells of an arabidopsis cotyledon and compares favourably with _PROTEIN_ eos _PROTEIN_ stably in arabidopsis when driven by the promoter . images were taken before and after photoactivation of the eos protein and they clearly show the local rise in eos emission at wavelengths of nm with exciation at nm following photoactivation and its spread within those cells targeted in photoactivation . also visible is a concurrent decline in emission between and nm with excitation at nm that is a common feature of eos photoactivation . _PROTEIN_ is predominantly a _LOCATION_ protein like other members of the redoxin/gst transferase protein family so its mobility within the cell is expected . the eos photoconversion in this case offers a check against interference from background _METHOD_ associated with these photosynthetic tissues as chloroplast _METHOD_ is also enhanced by the high intensity light used in photoconversion . the observations thus underscore the utility of the transformation strategy in studies of protein dynamics in guard cells for example in relation to environmental stimuli . in conclusion we present an improved vector set for transformation as well as extended methods for transient _PROTEIN_ analysis in arabidopsis . these new tools will help accelerate studies of endosomal organization protein localization and dynamics and will facilitate work on root hairs and in guard cells that in the past have proven recalcitrant to transient agrobacterium mediated transformation as a strategy for transient gene _PROTEIN_ . our vector set offers straightforward access to both n and c terminal fusion constructs with a promoter that gives moderate levels of _PROTEIN_ of both intrinsic _LOCATION_ and soluble proteins . _PROTEIN_ based on the promoter gives exceptional temporal stability that in conjunction with a co cultivation strategy enables reliable transformation of guard cells as well as epidermal cells and root hairs in arabidopsis . these tools should find wide application in studies for example of _PROTEIN_ development root rhizosphere interactions ion transport and interactions with symbionts and may also find applications in high throughoutput screens directed to characterizing candidate gene products and their partners .
a bp genomic dna fragment immediately upstream of the _PROTEIN_ start codon was identified based on the _PROTEIN_ promoter sequence and was amplified from arabidopsis col genomic dna using forward and reverse primers . the amplified fragment was digested by hindiii and xhoi and cloned into _METHOD_ to verify its ability to drive _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ after agrobacterium mediated transformation in nicotiana benthamiana . sequencing of several clones showed a c to a nucleotide exchange at position in the col promoter sequence when compared to that of the published col sequence . the promoter was introduced into the vector from which it was excised as a starting point in developing the vectors described here . the vector was digested using spei and aflii and the opened segment amplified by pcr using a forward primer generating and psii sites upstream of the and a site to incorporate the basta resistance gene . ligation of this pcr product into the open vector created an intermediate construct . the promoter was removed by digestion with pmei and spei and was replaced with a corresponding fragment from the vector containing the _PROTEIN_ promotor followed by the gateway cassette thereby creating pub dest . _METHOD_ tags _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and eos as well as the split _METHOD_ variants _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ were synthesized via pcr to introduce and sites and were subsequently ligated into the vector creating the c terminal vector set in pubc dest . to generate the corresponding vector set with n terminal fluorophores two pcr fragments were created using pub dest as a template . the fragments contained the vector backbone the first stretching from an avrii site between the pvs replication and origin to the end of the _PROTEIN_ promotor adding spei and mfei sites and a second stretching from the avrii site to the end of the terminator and adding mfei and psii sites . ligation of these fragments resulted in a circular vector lacking a gateway cassette . this intermediate vector was opened using the blunt end enzyme psii and the gateway cassette a from the gateway conversion kit was introduced creating the pubn dest vector . the _METHOD_ tags were amplified by pcr to introduce spei and mfei sites at the and ends respectively and were ligated into pubn dest to generate the n terminal vector set . a schematic of both pubn dest and pubc dest is shown in figure . all gateway vectors were cloned and amplifed using e. coli ccdb cells and selected using spectinomycin and chlorampenicol . vector backbones were verified by restriction digest analysis and complete sequencing . entry clones encoding _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were constructed by pcr amplification using primers that contained and sites as modifications . gel purified pcr products were introduced into using _PROTEIN_ clonase ii according to the manufacturer s instructions . recombinant entry clones were amplified in _PROTEIN_ cells and were verified by restriction digest analysis and sequencing . lr recombination reactions were performed by mixing of pubc dest or pubn dest vector including the fluorophores of the entry clone and of lr clonase ii to generate _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ n terminally and _PROTEIN_ c terminally tagged with the fluorophores . the reaction was incubated at room temperature for h. aliquots of were then used to transform _PROTEIN_ bacterial cells which were grown overnight at on agar plates with luria bertani media containing spectinomycin . selected colonies were isolated and the clones were verified through restriction digest analysis . destination clones were transformed subsequently in agrobacterium tumefaciens strain . successful transformations were verified by plasmid rescue in e. coli and restriction digest analysis . agrobacterium carrying clones of interest were grown in a first cycle overnight in ml lb medium with rifampicin gentamycin and spectinomycin . a second cycle of growth was started by innoculating an aliquot from the overnight growth at a dilution in fresh medium and then cultured for h to give a final of . the bacteria were harvested and resuspended in mm with acetosyringone and mm ethanesulphonic acid ph before dilution in the same medium to give a final or for tobacco leaf infiltration . for co cultivation with arabidopsis the bacteria were resuspended in half strength _METHOD_ basal salts medium ph to a final with acetosyringone and sylwet . nicotiana benthamiana and nicotiana tabacum were grown as described previously . a. thaliana l. seeds were sterilized for min in with triton and stratified at least days at in the dark before incubation in six well plates containing ml half strength _METHOD_ medium . arabidopsis seeds were germinated under constant light at light and . after germination the medium was exchanged with fresh half strength _METHOD_ plus acetosyringone sylwet including a suspension of agrobacterium carrying the transgene of interest . _PROTEIN_ was determined by confocal laser imaging using a carl zeiss _PROTEIN_ meta uv confocal laser scanning microscope with argon ion and helium/neon lasers . for visualizing _METHOD_ and non photoactivated eos excitation at nm was used and _METHOD_ collected after reflection off an dichroic mirror and passage through a nm bandpass filter . eos was photoactivated with and nm light from an enterprise ii uv laser and the photoactivated eos was visualized with excitation at nm after passage through an dichroic mirror and nm bandpass filter . chloroplast _METHOD_ was separated using a dichroic mirror and was collected using the meta detector set for a bandwidth of nm . laser power dichroics filters detector gains and offsets were kept fixed for all the different specimens to allow comparison between the different samples . as necessary only the laser attenuation was varied within the pre calibrated linear range of the tuneable optical filters of the instrument . transformation distributions and _METHOD_ tracking were quantified using both the carl zeiss lsm aim software and imagej . _METHOD_ values are reported as the means _PROTEIN_ of at least three independent experiments or seedlings after subtracting background _METHOD_ measured in controls co cultivated with non transformed agrobacterium . for _PROTEIN_ analysis by western blot seedlings were harvested after examination under the confocal microscope flash frozen and ground under liquid nitrogen . total proteins were extracted in denaturing lyse and load buffer and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and western blot analyses were performed as described previously . polyclonal rabbit anti _METHOD_ primary antibody was diluted . bound antibodies were detected using goat anti rabbit igg alkaline phosphatase and staining solution of mbt and bcip in ml of staining buffer containing mm tris hcl ph mm nacl and mm . all non commercial vector constructs described in this article are available for
