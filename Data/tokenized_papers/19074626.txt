is the arabidopsis homolog of _PROTEIN_ a microtubule associated host _PROTEIN_ of tobacco mosaic virus movement protein that was been previously identified in nicotiana tabacum . to analyze the endogenous function of and its role in viral infections transgenic arabidopsis plant lines stably overexpressing green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ were established . the _METHOD_ fusion protein was detectable in various cell types and organs and localized at microtubules in a punctuate pattern or in filaments . to determine whether overexpression impacted on the cortical microtubular _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ overexpressing plants were compared to known microtubular marker lines . in rapidly elongated cell types such as vein cells and root cells _METHOD_ overexpression caused highly unordered assemblies of cortical microtubules a disturbed snake like microtubular shape and star like crossing points of microtubules . phenotypically _METHOD_ transgenic plants showed retarded growth but were viable and fertile . seedlings of _METHOD_ transgenic plants were characterized by clockwise twisted leaves clustered stomata and enhanced drought tolerance . _METHOD_ overexpressing plants showed increased resistance against oilseed rape mosaic virus a close relative of tobacco mosaic virus but not against cucumber mosaic virus when compared to arabidopsis wild type plants . these results suggest that is involved in the alignment of cortical microtubules the patterning of stomata and restricting tobamoviral infections .
arabidopsis contains only a single homolog of _PROTEIN_ with a calculated molecular _METHOD_ of kd . thus arabidopsis presents an ideal system to study the function of the protein . bioinformatic analysis of and highlights a coiled coil region in similar as described for the n. tabacum _PROTEIN_ . an alignment of _PROTEIN_ protein sequences from arabidopsis n. tabacum and n. benthamiana showed four conserved domains with domain ii and iii located within the coiled coil region . thus there is considerable similarity suggesting that has functions similar to the and proteins . to further characterize functions the generation of knockdown plants and _METHOD_ overexpression lines was attempted the latter one with the aim to facilitate microtubular analysis on the subcellular level . whereas in the case of knockdown lines whose generation was attempted by transforming plants with a silencing construct no transformants could be regenerated the generation of _METHOD_ overexpression lines was successful . cdna was cloned by reverse transcription pcr from rna derived from arabidopsis ecotype columbia into the binary vector an overexpression vector which contains two cauliflower mosaic virus promoters followed by the _METHOD_ coding sequence to enable _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ fusion protein at high levels . arabidopsis wild type plants were transformed by agrobacterium mediated transformation and several nonsegregating transgenic lines were established . to confirm overexpression of _METHOD_ in those lines total protein extracts were analyzed by western blotting with a _METHOD_ antibody . indeed in _METHOD_ transgenic plants a band at the expected height of the _METHOD_ fusion protein was present which was absent in wild type plants . two lines were selected for subsequent experiments and yielded similar results . previous experiments in n. tabacum indicated punctuate localization of _PROTEIN_ at microtubules . to test whether was similarly localized its subcellular localization in arabidopsis was evaluated in two ways . firstly by transient _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ via biolistic delivery into wild type plants and secondly by analyzing various cell types in transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . for transient _PROTEIN_ the _METHOD_ vector was biolistically delivered into epidermal leaf cells of arabidopsis col wild type plants . _PROTEIN_ cells were analyzed by confocal microscopy . the _METHOD_ fusion protein showed a punctuate localization pattern . in transgenic arabidopsis plants _METHOD_ fusion protein was clearly detectable in various tissues and organs by confocal microscopy . in epidermal leaf cells _METHOD_ appeared either as a mixture of filaments and punctae or it localized solely in filaments . punctuate localization of was similar to the pattern observed for endogenous _PROTEIN_ detected in n. tabacum protoplasts . filamentous localization pattern was also previously observed for an n terminally truncated version of _PROTEIN_ which decorated microtubules in a continuous fashion . in the case of _METHOD_ overexpression lines filamentous appearance is probably due to the high levels of protein . in summary displays a localization pattern in line with the pattern found for the tobacco homolog indicating that likely localizes to microtubules . to confirm that _METHOD_ binds to microtubules plant leaves were treated with oryzalin a drug that inhibits polymerization of microtubules . as a control a _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ line was used where tubulin fused to _METHOD_ is overexpressed and readily incorporated into microtubules . leaves of _METHOD_ overexpression lines and of control plants were incubated in oryzalin in ethanol or in ethanol for h. confocal images were taken before and at the end of the incubation period . _METHOD_ appeared in filaments before treatment and after h incubation in ethanol . after incubation in oryzalin filaments disappeared and a uniform cytoplasmic _METHOD_ was observed instead . _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ leaves showed _METHOD_ filaments representing microtubules before treatment . after h of treatment with oryzalin _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ appeared as diffuse cytoplasmic labeling indicating that microtubules were depolymerized . interestingly incubation in ethanol resulted already in a strong reduction of filamentous labeling as only occasionally was labeling of microtubules visible . overall these results indicate that _METHOD_ localizes to microtubules . however in contrast to _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ likely exerts a stabilizing function because microtubules remained intact upon incubation in ethanol whereas _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ labeled microtubules were largely lost under those conditions . to determine if overexpression of _METHOD_ changes the organization of the cortical microtubular _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ overexpressing plants were compared to known microtubular marker lines _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . in the _METHOD_ transgenic line is overexpressed in arabidopsis ecotype col and decorates microtubules . cortical microtubular assemblies showed a striking difference between _METHOD_ overexpressing lines and marker lines in vein cells and roots . in _METHOD_ overexpressing trichomes vein cells and root cells microtubules appeared snake like and crossed each other forming star like clusters . this was in contrast to the marker lines where microtubules in those cell types had a more straight shape . the regularity of cortical microtubular arrays in vein cells and root cells also differed between _METHOD_ overexpressing transgenic plants and those in the marker lines . _METHOD_ decorated microtubules were unordered and extended in all directions . in contrast microtubules in control root cells and vein cells were regularly ordered and arrayed transversely to the longitudinal axis similar to cortical microtubular arrays in arabidopsis wild type plants . interestingly in cells where _METHOD_ manifested as punctae enrichment at some microtubular star like clusters became apparent . furthermore analysis of the cortical microtubular array in root tips was performed . _METHOD_ decorated microtubules showed strong bundling leading to short and _PROTEIN_ microtubules . in root tips of _METHOD_ overexpressing plants however no bundling of microtubules was observed . in summary overexpression of _METHOD_ leads to severe disturbance of cortical microtubular arrays in elongated cell types such as trichomes vein cells and root cells as well as in root tips . transgenic plants overexpressing _METHOD_ showed retarded growth and reduced efficiency in the production of seeds but were viable and fertile . interestingly seedlings grown on gm medium or soil developed clockwise twisted leaves . on gm medium this phenotype first became apparent in d old seedlings and became more pronounced during development it was clearly absent from wild type seedlings grown in the same conditions . the phenotype was also visible in older plants grown directly on soil . because leaves were twisted we also examined petioles to see whether any differences in cellular arrangement were apparent . petioles of _METHOD_ overexpressing plants appeared _PROTEIN_ than those of wild type plants . at the microscopic level this impression was clearly confirmed . here individual cells of the petioles were larger in _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ lines than in their wild type counterparts . however epidermal cells were arranged in regular files oriented along the axis of the petiole both in _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ lines and in wild type plants indicating that arrangement of epidermal cell files is not the cause for the twisted leaf phenotype . _PROTEIN_ has been identified as a negative regulator of viral cell to cell transport . therefore it was hypothesized that on the endogenous level _PROTEIN_ functions might include regulation of endogenous non cell autonomous processes . one of those processes is the patterning of stomata at leaf surfaces . stomata are almost always separated from each other by at least one intervening cell . this phenomenon is also called the one cell spacing rule . when the abaxial side of leaves of _METHOD_ transgenic plants grown on gm medium was examined two or more stomata located next to each other could frequently be observed . in contrast in arabidopsis wild type plants . stomata were usually separated by at least one cell . to quantify this phenomenon stomata of leaves from _METHOD_ overexpressing plants and wild type plants were evaluated . in _METHOD_ overexpressing lines of stomata were single were paired were triples and of stomata were found even in quartettes . stomata in clusters were positioned at various angles to each other . in arabidopsis wild type plants most of the stomata were single and only were paired . no triple or quartette stomata were observed . individual stomata appeared similar in _METHOD_ overexpressing plants and wild type plants they showed bilateral symmetry and were always composed of paired cells . in addition the number of stomatal units the number of separate stomatal sites increased from in wild type to in _METHOD_ overexpression plants indicating that stomatal sites are denser and the absolute number of stomata is larger in _METHOD_ overexpression plants . in summary this analysis suggests that in _METHOD_ overexpressing plants the morphology of individual stomata is retained whereas stomata patterning is severely disturbed . stomata control water loss under changing environmental conditions . prompted by the increased number of stomata in plants overexpressing we analyzed the performance of these plants under drought stress conditions . four week old soil grown wild type plants and overexpressor line _METHOD_ were exposed to a severe drought and analyzed for their survival rate . after a period of withholding water for d _METHOD_ overexpressing plants showed significantly less wilting than wild type plants . after rehydration for h of _METHOD_ plants had recovered while all wild type plants had died showing that overexpressors tolerate severe drought periods significantly better than wild type plants . based on the known negative effect of transiently overexpressed _PROTEIN_ on tmv _PROTEIN_ cell to cell movement in n. tabacum it was expected that stable overexpression of in plants might have a negative effect on tmv infections . due to the symptomless nature of tmv infection in arabidopsis we used a related tobamovirus ormv to test this hypothesis with the _METHOD_ overexpressing lines . a total of _METHOD_ overexpressing plants and arabidopsis wild type plants were inoculated with ormv . to evaluate whether plants were infected or not total protein extracts were analyzed for the presence of viral coat protein which is made in large amounts during tobamovirus infection and can be easily detected . indeed a band at the expected height of the ormv coat protein could be clearly detected d after inoculation . at and d after inoculation plants were harvested and their infection status was determined . for wild type plants none were infected at d postinoculation of plants were infected at dpi at dpi and of plants were infected at dpi . for _METHOD_ overexpressing plants none were infected at dpi at dpi at dpi and of _METHOD_ overexpressing plants were infected at dpi . these results indicate that overexpression of _METHOD_ has a negative effect on ormv infections and that plants overexpressing _METHOD_ show increased resistance against ormv . to determine whether increased resistance is specific for ormv infections or a more general effect the ls strain of cmv was employed for a similar study . again detection of coat protein was used to determine the infection status of a plant . at dpi neither arabidopsis wild type plants nor _METHOD_ overexpressing plants were infected . at dpi of wild type plants were infected at dpi and at dpi of wild type plants were infected . at dpi of _METHOD_ overexpressing plants were infected at dpi and at dpi . thus _METHOD_ overexpressing plants and arabidopsis wild type plants do not show a significant difference in infectivity indicating that overexpression of _METHOD_ has no effect on ls cmv infection . taken together these results confirm the hypothesis that stable overexpression of in plants has a negative effect on ormv infections . this negative effect is likely specific for ormv infections because ls cmv infections were not impaired .
