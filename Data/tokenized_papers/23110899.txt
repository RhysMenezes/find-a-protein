the circadian clock plays a crucial role in coordinating plant metabolic and physiological functions with predictable environmental variables such as dusk and dawn while also modulating responses to biotic and abiotic _PROTEIN_ . much of the initial characterization of the circadian system has focused on transcriptional initiation but it is now apparent that considerable regulation is exerted after this key regulatory step . transcript processing protein stability and cofactor availability have all been reported to influence circadian _METHOD_ in a variety of species . we used a genetic screen to identify a mutation within a putative rna binding protein _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ that induces a long circadian period phenotype under constant conditions . _PROTEIN_ is a homolog of the spliceosomal proteins _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ involved in spliceosome disassembly . analysis of general and alternative splicing using a high resolution rt pcr system revealed that mutation of this protein causes less efficient splicing of most but not all of the introns analyzed . in particular the altered accumulation of circadian associated transcripts may contribute to the observed mutant phenotype . interestingly mutation of a close homolog of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ does not cause a circadian phenotype which suggests divergence in function between these family members . our work highlights the importance of posttranscriptional control within the clock mechanism .
to discover new genes and alleles with a role in the plant circadian clock we mutagenized arabidopsis plants carrying a clock regulated bioluminescent reporter cold circadian rhythm and rna binding luciferase _PROTEIN_ . progeny were assayed in constant conditions and mutants with altered free running circadian _METHOD_ were selected as previously described . one such mutant was isolated on the basis of an enhanced bioluminescence long period phenotype . we then used publicly available simple sequence length polymorphism markers to identify the locus responsible for this phenotype . after screening plants from an mapping population we identified a kb region on chromosome that cosegregated with the long period phenotype . this region contains annotated genes . sequencing of candidate loci led to the identification of a g to a transition within the gene _GENE_ that is predicted to generate a premature termination codon _PROTEIN_ . _GENE_ shares significant homology with _PROTEIN_ genes identified in other metazoa and we therefore designated our mutant _PROTEIN_ . as a lesion in _PROTEIN_ appeared to be responsible for the observed long period circadian phenotype we identified an additional t dna insertion line within the _PROTEIN_ locus from the sail collection and renamed this allele _PROTEIN_ . for both mutant alleles _PROTEIN_ transcripts were readily detected but at reduced levels and likely represent unproductive nonsense mediated decay sensitive transcripts due to the introduction of a _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ and the t dna insertion in _PROTEIN_ . comparable long period phenotypes were observed in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ seedlings confirming that these mutant phenotypes are attributable to disruption of the _PROTEIN_ locus . however we did not observe a rhythmic pattern of _PROTEIN_ transcript abundance in constant conditions suggesting that the _PROTEIN_ transcript itself is not subject to circadian regulation . sequence analysis of _PROTEIN_ reveals that it shares significant homology with the _PROTEIN_ family of proteins the human _PROTEIN_ homolog has been identified as a component of spliceosomal complexes in many proteomic studies thereby implicating these proteins in pre mrna splicing . _PROTEIN_ is highly similar to other _PROTEIN_ family members containing three conserved domains and sharing overall amino acid identity and similarity when compared with the human protein . _PROTEIN_ contains two putative _LOCATION_ localization signals near the n terminus of the protein and consistent with these predicted motifs we found _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ to be localized to the _LOCATION_ when _PROTEIN_ under the control of the native _PROTEIN_ promoter . this fusion protein also rescues the _PROTEIN_ mutant phenotypes . _PROTEIN_ also retains the highly conserved gly and tyr residues within the g patch that are required for binding to _LOCATION_ acids and the conserved gly and phe residues within the n terminal tuftelin interacting protein _PROTEIN_ domain in common with other family members . before proceeding with additional characterization of the _PROTEIN_ circadian phenotype we backcrossed _PROTEIN_ to its parental columbia wild type five times so as to minimize the number of unlinked genetic lesions present within the _PROTEIN_ germplasm . we then evaluated the _PROTEIN_ circadian phenotype in a range of different light conditions including constant darkness constant red or constant blue light . in all cases oscillations of _PROTEIN_ luc bioluminescence in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ plants have a free running period h longer than the wild type . as circadian _METHOD_ may be entrained by either light or temperature cycles we also evaluated the phenotype of _PROTEIN_ mutants after growth under constant light but with regular temperature cycles . as for plants synchronized with light/dark cycles _PROTEIN_ mutants had a longer period than wild type seedlings when entrained with temperature cues before release to constant conditions . to further determine the role of _PROTEIN_ within the circadian system we next assessed the extent to which cycling of specific clock genes was affected in _PROTEIN_ mutants in free running conditions using quantitative rt pcr to evaluate transcript oscillation over a h time course in constant white light . peak and trough _PROTEIN_ of clock associated genes was delayed in _PROTEIN_ over the d time course consistent with each gene cycling with a long period . however we did not observe any defects in _PROTEIN_ of these genes beyond this alteration of phase under these free running conditions . although regulated by an endogenous oscillator circadian clock genes are frequently also induced by environmental changes . this sensitivity ensures the appropriate coordination of metabolism and physiology with the environment and increases the fitness of the plant . we therefore examined the _PROTEIN_ patterns of circadian genes in _PROTEIN_ mutants under long day conditions . in addition to the phase shifting of clock gene transcript levels observed under constant light in light/dark cycles we observed other complex effects on transcript accumulation . after dawn peak levels of _PROTEIN_ but not _PROTEIN_ were significantly reduced in _PROTEIN_ . in the morning levels of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ transcripts were increased in _PROTEIN_ whereas the waveform of _PROTEIN_ accumulation was delayed in _PROTEIN_ mutants . _PROTEIN_ accumulation in the _PROTEIN_ night was also reduced in _PROTEIN_ mutants likely due to the long period phenotype . in the afternoon peak levels of _PROTEIN_ were slightly reduced while the _PROTEIN_ peak was delayed . a similar phase delay in transcript accumulation was seen for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . thus regulation of clock gene transcript accumulation is significantly perturbed in _PROTEIN_ mutants grown in light/dark cycles . similar results were observed in _PROTEIN_ mutants although the effects of this allele were generally less severe . in addition to these circadian and diurnal phenotypes _PROTEIN_ plants showed enhanced bioluminescence activity relative to the wild type in all conditions . this phenotype was also observed when an alternate circadian reporter construct _PROTEIN_ luc was introgressed into a _PROTEIN_ mutant background . in an effort to further characterize this phenotype we assessed luc mrna levels by qrt pcr . despite the obvious differences in bioluminescence this analysis revealed no appreciable changes in luc transcript levels compared with the wild type suggesting a posttranscriptional cause for this phenotype . a similar increase in the activity of luciferase reporter genes has previously been reported for another arabidopsis long period mutant tej which encodes a poly glycohydrolase _PROTEIN_ . like _PROTEIN_ tej mutants do not have increased levels of endogenous luc mrnas although application of the _PROTEIN_ inhibitor aminobenzamide was sufficient to rescue the luminescence phenotype of the tej mutant . while we were able to recapitulate the phenotypic rescue of tej mutants following ab treatment as previously described _PROTEIN_ did not show a significant response to this treatment . it therefore appears that the increased bioluminescence of _PROTEIN_ mutants is neither caused by higher luc gene _PROTEIN_ nor by activation of the _PROTEIN_ pathway . as the enhanced bioluminescence phenotype was not observed in _PROTEIN_ plants it was possible that an additional linked mutation from the initial mutant screen might be responsible for this phenotype . to determine whether the enhanced luminescence was caused by mutation of _PROTEIN_ we transformed _PROTEIN_ mutants carrying the _PROTEIN_ luc reporter with a wild type copy of the _GENE_ coding region along with a kb region of upstream genomic sequence . seedlings homozygous for the wild type transgene had a circadian rhythm that was comparable to the wild type in period and amplitude under all conditions tested . in addition these plants exhibited wild type levels of luminescence . thus a wild type copy of _GENE_ rescues both the long period and high luminescence phenotypes of _PROTEIN_ plants suggesting that truncation of _PROTEIN_ within the ethyl methanesulfonate _METHOD_ generated _PROTEIN_ allele has additional genetically recessive consequences beyond the impairment of circadian function . given the circadian phenotype and altered accumulation of some clock related transcripts in the _PROTEIN_ mutants we next examined whether altered splicing patterns were observed for these genes in the mutants . samples were collected h after dawn under driven light/dark cycles a time when the ends of transcripts of clock genes such as _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ show very similar _PROTEIN_ levels in the mutant and wild type . relative levels of alternatively spliced _METHOD_ were assessed as previously described . dramatic differences were observed within the splicing variant populations of many core clock transcripts including _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . in total we used oligonucleotide pairs to evaluate splicing events across eight different clock genes . of the splicing events studied of the clock transcripts tested had significant differences in accumulation between _PROTEIN_ and wild type seedlings . similar patterns were observed in both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ alleles although differences in as were in general slightly less severe in the latter genetic background . although we found that many different types of as _PROTEIN_ are affected in clock genes in the _PROTEIN_ mutants the greatest effect is an increased abundance of transcripts with retained introns including unspliced transcripts . indeed many intron retention transcripts observed in the _PROTEIN_ mutants are barely visible in the wild type and other intron retention transcripts that are present in the wild type are increased in the mutants . to examine the general effects on splicing of the _PROTEIN_ mutant we also analyzed splicing/as of a number of non clock related genes . we surveyed different genes each with a single oligonucleotide pair . the majority showed increased levels of intron retention transcripts and unspliced transcripts with somewhat reduced levels of fully spliced mrnas as above . a total of of all the _METHOD_ evaluated were altered by more than in _PROTEIN_ seedlings compared with the wild type . this suggests that the _PROTEIN_ mutant impacts the efficiency of splicing of both constitutive and alternatively spliced introns such that a proportion of transcripts from most genes is not spliced to completion . this is also illustrated by the detection of unspliced transcripts in _PROTEIN_ . in previous analyses of the non clock genes using the same primers and range of rnas from wild type and various mutant plants _PROTEIN_ rt pcr products representing unspliced transcripts are usually absent or in very low abundance . the increased levels of unspliced _PROTEIN_ and other transcripts in _PROTEIN_ is not due to genomic dna contamination since we were not able to amplify such products in pcr reactions using purified rna as template . importantly fs transcripts remain the most abundant products perhaps explaining why the _PROTEIN_ splicing defect is not inherently lethal . for the clock genes we first examined as changes in transcripts arising from the _PROTEIN_ locus using primers spanning exons to . at fs _PROTEIN_ transcript accounts for of the total population in wild type samples with most of the remainder identified as _PROTEIN_ in which intron is retained . by contrast fs _PROTEIN_ transcript only represents of the total transcripts in _PROTEIN_ seedlings . we identified significant increases in the proportion of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ but also detected a greater proportion of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ is generated through the use of an alternate ss within intron that increases the transcript length by nucleotides . we also discovered a previously unidentified transcript not observed in the wild type which we designate _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in which intron is retained and an alternate ss removes nucleotides from exon . splicing defects were observed for _PROTEIN_ using primers spanning exons to which are all within the untranslated region . the fs transcript accounts for of the total product in the wild type with a smaller fraction represented by _PROTEIN_ in which intron in the untranslated region is retained . in _PROTEIN_ plants we observed a reduction in the proportion of the fs transcript and corresponding increases in the _PROTEIN_ isoform of _PROTEIN_ and unspliced product . previous work describing _PROTEIN_ has identified two as events generating four as transcript variants across exons and . we identified each of these _METHOD_ in wild type and _PROTEIN_ mutant plants but also detected significant quantities of unspliced product in _PROTEIN_ mutants _PROTEIN_ . as for other examined genes the proportion of transcripts retaining intron increased in _PROTEIN_ mutants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ with a commensurate _PROTEIN_ in the proportion of transcripts in which this intron was removed _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . in contrast with what we observed for these other clock genes there was no significant change in as ratios for _PROTEIN_ transcripts in the _PROTEIN_ mutants . although we collected samples during the morning we were also able to detect alterations in as transcript accumulation for evening phased genes despite their low levels of _PROTEIN_ . when we examined as across exons to of _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ seedlings we observed increased levels of _PROTEIN_ in which intron is retained . we also observed perturbations in _PROTEIN_ as _METHOD_ with _PROTEIN_ representing to of the total detected transcript in the mutant compared with in the wild type . these data indicate that the splicing defect observed in the _PROTEIN_ mutants affects the relative proportions of fs and alternatively spliced _METHOD_ of many although not all core clock genes . we also examined relative levels of each as isoform following normalization to ubiquitin _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . in particular fs _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are reduced approximately twofold but fs _PROTEIN_ is not significantly changed in _PROTEIN_ seedlings compared with the wild type . in addition _PROTEIN_ of fs _PROTEIN_ is increased in _PROTEIN_ mutant plants although relative levels of this evening phased gene remain low compared with morning phased genes such as _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ in levels of fs transcripts for _PROTEIN_ may be due to increased abundance of as but this is unlikely to explain the increase in _PROTEIN_ transcripts as as events are in low abundance . consistent with the selective effect of loss of _PROTEIN_ function on splicing of clock genes many as events are not altered in _PROTEIN_ mutants . therefore disruption of the _PROTEIN_ locus causes a range of defects within both as isoform population composition and fs transcript abundance for multiple clock genes all of which may contribute to the observed long period phenotype . _PROTEIN_ proteins have previously been described as single copy genes found throughout the metazoa although higher plants were not included in this survey . our phylogenetic analysis reveals that arabidopsis contains two _PROTEIN_ paralogs _PROTEIN_ and a related gene that we call _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are identical and similar at the amino acid level . similarly two paralogs were identified in moss populus trichocarpa and sorghum bicolor whereas four paralogs were identified in rice . our analysis suggests that duplication of this gene occurred independently in each of these lineages . however duplication of these genes has apparently not occurred in all plant species as only a single _PROTEIN_ homolog was identified in maize . both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are _PROTEIN_ throughout development and as for _PROTEIN_ we found that _PROTEIN_ is not rhythmically _PROTEIN_ under constant conditions . to ascertain whether _PROTEIN_ mutants also have a circadian defect we obtained a gabi kat t dna line with an insertion within this gene that we named _PROTEIN_ . once we confirmed that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was impaired we crossed the _PROTEIN_ luc reporter into this mutant background and found the free running period to be the same as the wild type . this suggests that _PROTEIN_ but not _PROTEIN_ is essential for _PROTEIN_ of the circadian system . as partial redundancy of function is frequently observed within gene families in arabidopsis we attempted to isolate a _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant to determine whether these plants had an exacerbated circadian phenotype . we crossed _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ to each other and examined segregation of the mutant alleles in the resulting progeny . despite examining seedlings we were unable to identify any _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant plants . furthermore no plants heterozygous for _PROTEIN_ and homozygous for _PROTEIN_ were obtained although we did isolate a small number of plants homozygous for _PROTEIN_ and heterozygous for _PROTEIN_ . this skewing of the expected segregation ratios is highly significant and indicates that a copy of either _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ is required for plant viability . since _PROTEIN_ is a paralog of _PROTEIN_ that does not have a mutant circadian phenotype we examined whether _PROTEIN_ seedlings displayed altered accumulation of circadian transcripts . using primers specific for the fs transcripts described in figure we found that the wild type fs transcript abundance closely matched the results obtained using primers in the end of transcripts but we did observe an increased peak level of fs _PROTEIN_ transcript in this line . however the phase of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ remains unchanged consistent with the normal period phenotype in these plants . to examine whether _PROTEIN_ affects constitutive or alternative splicing we examined the transcript profiles of clock and non clock associated genes in _PROTEIN_ . the striking increases in abundance of intron retention and unspliced transcripts seen with the _PROTEIN_ mutants are absent . only of _METHOD_ analyzed display a significant difference in accumulation between _PROTEIN_ and the wild type . therefore _PROTEIN_ has no effect on splicing efficiency of the majority of genes/transcripts analyzed . these data reinforce our finding that _PROTEIN_ has a general function in the splicing process and plays a predominant role in as events in clock transcripts and suggests that _PROTEIN_ may only affect a small subset of introns/genes . therefore despite the homology between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and their possible partial functional redundancy _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ these related genes have diverged functions and very different impacts on the circadian system .
the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ allele was isolated from a previously described mutant population . in brief arabidopsis thaliana plants transformed with the _PROTEIN_ luc reporter construct were mutagenized with _METHOD_ before seeds were screened for defective circadian _METHOD_ under constant darkness . _PROTEIN_ seeds were backcrossed to col for three generations before being outcrossed to landsberg
