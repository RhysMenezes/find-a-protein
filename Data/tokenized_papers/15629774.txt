we have previously reported that _PROTEIN_ an arabidopsis protein interacts with the coat protein of turnip crinkle virus in yeast cells and that this interaction correlated with the resistance response in the tcv resistant arabidopsis ecotype dijon . _PROTEIN_ was also able to activate transcription of reporter genes in yeast cells suggesting that it is likely a transcription _PROTEIN_ . we have now verified the physical interaction between _PROTEIN_ and tcv cp in vitro and showed that cp mutants unable to interact with _PROTEIN_ in yeast cells bind _PROTEIN_ with much lower affinity in vitro . secondly we have performed gel shift experiments demonstrating that _PROTEIN_ does not bind to dna in a sequence specific manner . the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ was also investigated by transiently _PROTEIN_ green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ in nicotiana benthamiana plant cells which showed that _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ localizes primarily to _LOCATION_ . significantly co _PROTEIN_ of tcvcp and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ prevented the _LOCATION_ localization of _PROTEIN_ . together these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ might be a transcription _PROTEIN_ involved in regulating the defense response of arabidopsis to tcv and that its normal role is compromised by interaction with the invading viral cp .
we have previously shown that tcv cp interacts with _PROTEIN_ in yeast cells and that the _PROTEIN_ interacting region in the cp mapped to the n terminal amino acids of its rna binding domain . we further demonstrated in that study that five cp mutants containing single amino acid changes within the r domain lost the interaction with _PROTEIN_ in yeast cells and viruses containing these five mutations also lost the ability to trigger the resistance response in a. thaliana ecotype dijon . conversely the one cp mutant _PROTEIN_ that retained the ability to interact with _PROTEIN_ also retained the ability to trigger the resistance when incorporated back into the virus . these results suggested that the cp _PROTEIN_ interaction is correlated with the ability of cp to elicit the resistance response . to confirm this correlation we felt it important to assess the binding ability of wild type and mutant cp with _PROTEIN_ in vitro . to demonstrate the interaction in vitro we produced a fusion protein in which _PROTEIN_ was fused to the c terminus of glutathione s transferase _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . wild type and mutant cps were then radiolabeled through in vitro translation . the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was first immobilized on glutathione sepharose beads followed by the addition of the s labelled tcv cp or mutant cp . after extensive washing to remove the unbound radioactivity the beads were subjected to _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ analysis to reveal any cp derivatives bound to _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ protein was also produced and included in every experiment as a negative control . we first tested the in vitro binding between _PROTEIN_ and full length tcv cp . as shown in citation a lanes _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ retained a significant portion of s labeled tcv cp . as expected the _PROTEIN_ control did not . an equivalent amount of the in vitro translated cp was loaded on the gel for comparison . note here that the lane with in vitro translated tcv cp contained multiple smaller bands that are likely degradation products . however only the full length cp was bound to _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . we then tested portions of the r domain for their ability to bind to _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ including the entire r domain the n terminal half of the r domain and the remaining portion of the r domain . the results show that the r domain alone was able to bind efficiently to _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . it was also evident that the n terminal aa region bound more weakly than the entire r domain and that the c terminal portion of r domain bound poorly if at all . these results correlated well with previous data derived from yeast two hybrid assays . in this initial experiment we also included the r domain of one of the resistance breaking cp mutants that was no longer able to interact with _PROTEIN_ in yeast cells . it displayed a markedly reduced _PROTEIN_ binding ability compared to the wild type r domain . we further examined additional single aa substitution mutants within the n terminus of cp and the results are shown in citation b . among these mutants all except and were reported previously . the and mutants behaved similarly to the other resistance breaking r domain mutants in that they were unable to interact with _PROTEIN_ in yeast cells and they could infect di plants systemically . it is clear from these results that for each of the resistance breaking cp mutants their corresponding r domains bound to _PROTEIN_ significantly more weakly than did the wild type r domain . only the _PROTEIN_ mutant which interacted with _PROTEIN_ in yeast cells and elicited a resistance response in di bound to _PROTEIN_ with similar affinity as the wild type r domain . we conclude from these data that there is a strong positive correlation between cp _PROTEIN_ interaction in yeast cells and the degree of physical binding in vitro . clearly the inability of most of cp mutants to interact with _PROTEIN_ in yeast cells was reflected as lower binding affinity in vitro . to quantitatively evaluate the difference in binding affinity between various cp mutants and wild type cp the binding experiments were repeated four times using the r domains of wild type cp and three representative mutants _PROTEIN_ . the x ray _METHOD_ were then scanned using a densitometer and the relative amount of mutant r domains bound to _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was determined by comparing with the wild type cp r domain bound . the results presented in citation c demonstrate that the wild type r domain and _PROTEIN_ displayed fold higher _PROTEIN_ binding capacity than the and mutants . together the data presented in this section validate the physical interaction between _PROTEIN_ and tcv cp and confirm the requirement of an intact wild type r domain for this interaction . we next wanted to map the functional domains of _PROTEIN_ in an effort to elucidate its role in the plant resistance pathway targeting tcv . we learned previously that _PROTEIN_ had two primary activities interaction with tcv cp and activation of reporter gene transcription in yeast cells . to delineate the region housing the transcriptional activation domain regions of the _PROTEIN_ gene were fused to the dna binding domain of the yeast shuttle vector _PROTEIN_ and assayed for their ability to activate the lacz reporter gene in a yeast one hybrid assay . these same regions of the _PROTEIN_ gene were also fused to the activation domain of to determine the region of _PROTEIN_ responsible for interacting with cp in a yeast two hybrid assay . the results of these experiments are summarized in citation . the ability of _PROTEIN_ to activate transcription was retained in the n terminal aa region but not when it was further shortened to the n terminal aa . conversely deletion of as little as aa from the n terminus abolished the transcriptional activation of _PROTEIN_ . these data mapped the transcriptional activator activity to the n terminal aa portion . in contrast the cp binding domain of _PROTEIN_ appeared to map exclusively to the c terminal aa residues . this is based on the observation that all of the c terminal deletions failed to interact with the cp and the _PROTEIN_ that this region alone was sufficient for cp interaction . the _PROTEIN_ that _PROTEIN_ activated transcription of the reporter gene in yeast cells prompted the speculation that _PROTEIN_ was likely a transcription _PROTEIN_ . indeed several other nac proteins have been shown to be transcriptional activators . arabidopsis proteins _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ like other known transcription _PROTEIN_ were also shown to bind dna . here we report the results of in vitro dna protein binding experiments in an effort to determine the nature of any _PROTEIN_ dna binding properties . for these experiments we used the n terminal aa portion of _PROTEIN_ that we showed in the previous section was responsible for the transcriptional activation activity . moreover the dna binding activity of both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ has been previously mapped to the n terminal conserved nac domain . the purified his tagged n was mixed with a pcr generated p labelled dna fragment of bp that contained random nucleotides flanked by restriction enzyme digestion sites . the results of a typical binding experiment are shown in citation a . note that _PROTEIN_ was able to bind to and retard the mobility of dna fragments to discreetly shifted bands in lanes and which likely represents homodimerization of _PROTEIN_ . to determine if this binding was specific for a sequence motif the individual shifted bands were excised recovered amplified by pcr and subjected to a second cycle of binding with the n peptide . this process of binding assays was repeated for several cycles in an effort to enrich for potential dna fragments with specific _PROTEIN_ binding sequences . lanes in citation a show the result of a third cycle of binding assays . a comparison of the results of the first and third cycle failed to reveal any significant quantitative difference in the amount of bound dna . this indicated that the process did not lead to enrichment of dna fragments that bound to _PROTEIN_ preferentially . we conclude from these results that _PROTEIN_ does not bind dna in a sequence specific manner . this conclusion was further supported in the assays using poly as a competitor in the third round of binding experiments . it is evident that increasing the amount of poly reduced the binding of _PROTEIN_ to the labeled dna proportionally . although these experiments establish that the truncated form of _PROTEIN_ binds to dna nonspecifically we can not be sure from these experiments if the level of binding was significant . moreover we can not completely rule out the possibility that full length _PROTEIN_ which was not used in these assays might bind dna more specifically . an additional characteristic of transcription _PROTEIN_ is that they localize to the _LOCATION_ of the cell . having shown that _PROTEIN_ activates transcription in yeast cells we next wanted to test if _PROTEIN_ would localize to the _LOCATION_ of plant cells . initial examination of the _PROTEIN_ sequence identified a region that could potentially form two overlapping putative _LOCATION_ localization signals of a bipartite nature which is typical for nlss of plant origin . to experimentally demonstrate the _LOCATION_ localization of _PROTEIN_ we utilized agro infiltration to deliver green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ into the cells of n. benthamiana plants . the infiltrated leaves were collected days after infiltration and directly observed by confocal microscopy . the distribution of green _METHOD_ throughout the cytoplasm was as expected for the control _METHOD_ ala protein . as anticipated the _METHOD_ ala _PROTEIN_ fusion protein primarily localized to the _LOCATION_ of cells . these results were also confirmed by _METHOD_ microscopy . we conclude from these results that _PROTEIN_ localizes to the cell _LOCATION_ further supporting the notion that _PROTEIN_ is a transcription _PROTEIN_ . we next wanted to determine if tcv cp _PROTEIN_ in plant cells might alter the cellular localization of _PROTEIN_ . to do this we delivered the construct designed to _PROTEIN_ the _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ into cells of n. benthamiana leaves together with constructs encoding each of the following proteins tcv cp the cp mutant and the cp of a related virus tomato bushy stunt virus . the result shown in panels and of citation b is particularly interesting . while co _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ ala and tcv cp did not visibly change the _METHOD_ distribution in the cell co _PROTEIN_ of tcv cp and _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ resulted in the formation of inclusion like structures in the cytoplasm that appeared to be around the periphery of the _LOCATION_ . importantly the cp mutant protein with reduced _PROTEIN_ binding ability failed to interrupt _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ localization . this result confirmed that there was a direct correlation between the ability of _PROTEIN_ and cp to interact and interference with proper cellular localization of _PROTEIN_ . the control protein tbsv cp also did not change the cellular localization of _PROTEIN_ . to further confirm that the inclusion like structures seen in panel were peripheral to the _LOCATION_ we did a separate set of experiments in which the _LOCATION_ of infiltrated cells were stained with diamidino phenylindole a dna staining reagent and examined by standard _METHOD_ microscopy . the results presented in citation c clearly show that the _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ in the presence of wild type tcv cp was localized in inclusion like structures in areas surrounding the _LOCATION_ rather than in the _LOCATION_ proper . the colocalization of dapi and _METHOD_ confirmed that the mutant protein was not able to prevent the _LOCATION_ localization of _PROTEIN_ . these results suggest that the tcv cp interacts with _PROTEIN_ in plant cells and effectively prevents the localization of this transcription _PROTEIN_ into the _LOCATION_ .
in vitro protein binding assays were performed using glutathione s transferase _PROTEIN_ fusion protein of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and in vitro translated cp derivatives . to produce _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ cdna was cloned into vector pgex to make the construct pgex _PROTEIN_ which was transformed into escherichia coli strain . the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ fusion protein was then purified from using glutathione sepharose _PROTEIN_ following the manufacturer 's specifications except that instead of of isopropyl d thiogalactoside was used to induce the _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_

produced as a _PROTEIN_ his fusion protein in e. coli using the pet _PROTEIN_ system and purified with the his bind quick column according to manufacturer 's specifications . the double stranded dna probe was generated by annealing primer c _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ to a fold molar excess of the oligonucleotide a _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ which contained random nucleotides in the middle followed by elongation with the klenow fragment of e. coli dna polymerase . the double stranded products were separated from single stranded oligonucleotide on an polyacrylamide gel and purified . they were then radioactively end labeled by kinase . the dna binding assays were carried out using a procedure modified after citation . the reactions were performed

then loaded on polyacrylamide gels that were prerun in tbe buffer for min at v. the gel was then run at v until the bromophenol blue dye was just off the gel . the band containing the dna fragments of slower mobility was excised and incubated at for h in ml extraction buffer _PROTEIN_ . the recovered dna fragments were precipitated with ethanol and amplified by pcr with primers b _PROTEIN_ and primer c. transient _PROTEIN_ of proteins in plant leaf cells was accomplished with the agrobacterium infiltration procedure . _PROTEIN_ cassettes containing cdnas of individual or fusion proteins sandwiched by cauliflower mosaic virus promoter and terminator sequences were cloned into the binary vector and transformed into agrobacterium strain . the constructs used in this experiment were pzp _METHOD_ ala pzp _METHOD_ ala _PROTEIN_ pzp tcvcp pzp tcvcp and pzp tbsvcp . pzp _METHOD_ ala _PROTEIN_ is designed to _PROTEIN_ the green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion protein in plant cells . it included alanine residues inserted between _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ to facilitate correct protein folding . accordingly the control construct pzp _METHOD_ ala _PROTEIN_ the modified version of _METHOD_ also had alanine residues at its c terminus . pzp tcvcp and pzp tcvcp would enable the _PROTEIN_ of tcv cp and its mutant . pzp tbsvcp is an additional control that _PROTEIN_ the coat protein of tomato bushy stunt virus . agrobacterium suspensions carrying the various binary constructs were pelleted and resuspended in a solution containing mm morpholinepropanesulfonic acid mm mgcl and acetosyringone to an optical density of at nm . in co inoculations equal volumes of each suspension were mixed prior to infiltration . three week old n. benthamiana were infiltrated on the first
