plant _PROTEIN_ has _PROTEIN_ and rna binding activities . in the nucleolus _PROTEIN_ is involved in rrna maturation and ribosome biogenesis through interaction with pes _PROTEIN_ and several ribosomal proteins .
multispecies sequence alignment revealed that plant _PROTEIN_ proteins are homologous to yeast and human ns particularly in the n terminal region and the circularly permutated _PROTEIN_ binding motifs . according to the genevestigator program arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ is constitutively _PROTEIN_ in various tissues and exhibits high transcript levels throughout plant development . to determine the in vivo effects of _PROTEIN_ deficiency in n. benthamiana and a. thaliana vigs and dex inducible rnai were performed using the protocol described in supplementary methods . for vigs three different n. benthamiana _PROTEIN_ cdna fragments were cloned these fragments were designated and which contained the full length coding region a n terminal region and a c terminal region of the cdna respectively . the three fragments were cloned into the trv based vigs vector to create trv trv and trv . these vectors were transformed into agrobacterium tumefaciens and n. benthamiana plants were infiltrated with the agrobacterium transformants . vigs using these trv constructs resulted in growth retardation and premature senescence with reduced chlorophyll contents in leaves compared with the trv control . real time quantitative rt pcr revealed significantly lower levels of endogenous transcripts in leaves of trv trv and trv vigs plants indicating silencing of _PROTEIN_ . silencing of _PROTEIN_ using vigs and dex inducible rnai in n. benthamiana and arabidopsis . schematic of n. benthamiana _PROTEIN_ structure and three vigs constructs that contain different cdna fragments as indicated by the bars . phenotypes of vigs plants . vigs resulted in growth retardation and premature senescence days after infiltration as compared with the control trv . quantification of total chlorophyll chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b contents in trv and trv plants . the fourth leaf above the infiltrated leaf was used for the analysis . real time quantitative rt pcr analysis of transcript levels in trv trv and trv plants using _PROTEIN_ a _PROTEIN_ b and _PROTEIN_ c primers respectively . the fourth leaf above the infiltrated leaf was used for the analysis . the tubulin mrna level was used as control . data represent the mean of three replicates per experiment . growth retardation and premature senescence in arabidopsis dex inducible _PROTEIN_ rnai lines in response to dex treatment . seedlings were grown for d on media that contained either ethanol or dex . real time quantitative rt pcr analysis of _PROTEIN_ transcript levels in the rnai lines grown for weeks on dex or dex media . rna was isolated from the whole seedlings . the _PROTEIN_ mrna level was used as control . next dex inducible _PROTEIN_ rnai lines were generated in arabidopsis . transgenic arabidopsis plants carried an _PROTEIN_ rnai construct containing an inverted repeat of the c terminal cdna fragment under the control of a dex inducible transcription system . the dex inducible _PROTEIN_ rnai lines were grown on _METHOD_ medium containing dex solubilized in ethanol or ethanol alone as a control . seedlings of two independent _PROTEIN_ rnai lines exhibited significantly retarded shoot and root growth and early onset of senescence on dex containing media . the effect of rnai on _PROTEIN_ mrna levels in seedlings was determined by real time quantitative rt pcr using _PROTEIN_ mrna as a control . seedlings of lines rnai and rnai grown on dex containing media had reduced _PROTEIN_ transcript levels compared with seedlings grown without dex . _PROTEIN_ contains a predicted basic domain a coiled coil domain the dar motif the _PROTEIN_ binding motifs _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and an acidic domain . multiple _LOCATION_ localization signals are located in both the n and c terminal regions which are marked with asterisks . to determine the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion proteins of arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ deletion mutants were _PROTEIN_ in n. benthamiana leaves via agroinfiltration . _METHOD_ was fused to the n termini of _PROTEIN_ and its derivatives . however the n terminal deletion form and the c terminal region _PROTEIN_ were more stable when fused to _METHOD_ via their c termini . confocal laser scanning microscopy of leaf protoplasts revealed that _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was predominantly localized to the nucleolus . deletion of the _PROTEIN_ binding motifs _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or the c terminal region did not affect _PROTEIN_ nucleolar localization . however deletion of the n terminal amino acids resulted in _PROTEIN_ distribution in the _LOCATION_ and the _LOCATION_ . the deletion mutant lacking the n terminal amino acids was not stably _PROTEIN_ in n. bethamiana leaves _PROTEIN_ of the position of _METHOD_ tagging . the n terminus _PROTEIN_ was sufficient to target the _METHOD_ fusion protein to the nucleolus . the _METHOD_ fusion protein containing the _PROTEIN_ c terminal region _PROTEIN_ localized to both the _LOCATION_ and the _LOCATION_ . this result suggests that the _PROTEIN_ n terminal region is crucial for _PROTEIN_ nucleolar localization . subcellular localization of arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ and its deletion mutants . schematic of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ deletion mutants . b basic domain cc coiled coil domain dar the dar motif _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ binding motifs and a acidic domain . amino acid residues at deletion points are marked . asterisks indicate _LOCATION_ localization signals . subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ deletion mutants using _METHOD_ fusion . _METHOD_ fusion proteins were _PROTEIN_ in n. benthamiana leaves via agroinfiltration and protoplasts prepared from the infiltrated leaves were observed by confocal laser scanning microscopy for _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and chlorophyll _METHOD_ . protoplasts _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ were stained with diamidino phenylindole to visualize the _LOCATION_ . effects of mycophenolic acid _PROTEIN_ on the localization of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ deletion mutants . nictiana benthamiana leaves were agroinfiltrated with _METHOD_ fusion constructs and then treated with _PROTEIN_ for . _LOCATION_ were visualized by dapi staining . next it was tested whether _PROTEIN_ depletion within a cell affects the nucleolar localization of either _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ deletion mutants lacking the _PROTEIN_ binding motifs . nicotiana benthamiana leaves were agroinfiltrated to _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion proteins of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ deletion mutants and then treated with mycophenolic acid _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ inhibits inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase _PROTEIN_ the rate limiting enzyme for the de novo synthesis of guanine nucleotides . confocal microscopy revealed that _PROTEIN_ translocated from the nucleolus to the nucleoplasm after of _PROTEIN_ treatment . however the _PROTEIN_ mutants and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ did not undergo translocation their _METHOD_ fusion proteins remained in the nucleolus after _PROTEIN_ treatment . these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ depletion mediated by _PROTEIN_ inhibition causes repartitioning of _PROTEIN_ into the nucleoplasm and this translocation requires intact _PROTEIN_ binding motifs of _PROTEIN_ . it has been reported that the ribosome assembly _PROTEIN_ contain rna binding domains in addition to the _PROTEIN_ domain yeast binds directly to rrna and trna via its n terminal domain . to determine if _PROTEIN_ binds rna recombinant proteins of full length _PROTEIN_ and the _PROTEIN_ n terminal domain _PROTEIN_ fused to mbp were prepared . the rna binding activity of a region that was previously annotated as a putative rna binding domain _PROTEIN_ was also tested . the corresponding cdna fragments were cloned into the pmal vector _PROTEIN_ in escherichia coli and recombinant mbp fusion proteins were affinity purified using the n terminal mbp tag . the binding of these recombinant proteins to rrna as an rna substrate was determined using _METHOD_ . labeled rrna synthesized in vitro was incubated with mbp _PROTEIN_ mbp _PROTEIN_ n mbp _PROTEIN_ and mbp in the absence or presence of _PROTEIN_ and rna protein complexes were resolved by agarose gel electrophoresis . both mbp _PROTEIN_ and mbp _PROTEIN_ n readily formed stable rna protein complexes _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ status whereas neither mbp _PROTEIN_ nor mbp complexed with rna . mbp _PROTEIN_ and mbp _PROTEIN_ n also formed rna protein complexes with labelled rrna with or without _PROTEIN_ whereas mbp _PROTEIN_ or mbp did not . these results indicate that _PROTEIN_ has an rna binding activity and the _PROTEIN_ n terminal domain contributes to the binding . gel mobility shift assay to detect rna binding activity of _PROTEIN_ . maltose binding protein fused _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ derivatives were purified from e. coli and the eluted proteins were visualized by _METHOD_ blue staining . _PROTEIN_ n n terminal domain of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ a putative rna binding domain of _PROTEIN_ . size markers are indicated . mbp mbp _PROTEIN_ mbp _PROTEIN_ n and mbp _PROTEIN_ fusion proteins were incubated with of radiolabelled rrna or rrna with or without _PROTEIN_ . bound and unbound rnas were resolved on an agarose gel and visualized by phosphorimaging . the _PROTEIN_ activity of the recombinant _PROTEIN_ protein fused to mbp was then measured . _PROTEIN_ hydrolysis assay was performed to determine the turnover number of mbp _PROTEIN_ and the value was compared with those of _PROTEIN_ related _PROTEIN_ . at steady state the k cat value was for _PROTEIN_ for arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ for rice _PROTEIN_ for saccharomyces cerevisiae and for e. coli yjeq . thus the _PROTEIN_ activity of _PROTEIN_ was comparable with those of related eukaryotic and prokaryotic _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ activity of _PROTEIN_ in comparison with those of related _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ assay was performed as described in the materials and methods . data represent the mean deviation of three replicates per experiment . mammalian ns _METHOD_ a large protein complex that contains pescadillo _PROTEIN_ and a subset of ribosomal proteins . bifc was used to test if _PROTEIN_ interacts with arabidopsis pescadillo and _PROTEIN_ in vivo using . bifc has been widely used for visualization of protein protein interactions in living cells . plant pes is a nucleolar protein that plays a crucial role in biogenesis of the ribosomal large subunit through a functional link with _PROTEIN_ and . combinations of proteins were co _PROTEIN_ as n and a c terminal yellow _METHOD_ protein fusion proteins _METHOD_ _METHOD_ in n. benthamiana leaves by agroinfiltration . after protoplasts were prepared from the infiltrated leaves and observed with confocal laser scanning microscopy . all combinations of fusion protein _PROTEIN_ resulted in strong nucleolar _METHOD_ _METHOD_ indicating that _PROTEIN_ pes and _PROTEIN_ interact with each other in the nucleolus . the n terminal domain of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was sufficient for nucleolar interaction with pes and _PROTEIN_ whereas the deletion of the _PROTEIN_ n terminal amino acids caused protein interactions in both the nucleolus and the nucleoplasm . a deletion of the _PROTEIN_ binding motifs or the _PROTEIN_ c terminal domain did not affect the protein interactions in the nucleolus . these results suggest that the _PROTEIN_ n terminal domain plays a role in the interactions of _PROTEIN_ with pes and _PROTEIN_ but other domains of _PROTEIN_ also contribute to the protein interactions . next bifc interactions between _PROTEIN_ and pes mutants were examined . _PROTEIN_ interacted with the n terminal pes n domain in the nucleolus but with n in the _LOCATION_ . previously _METHOD_ fused n exhibited a diffuse nucleoplasmic distribution . these results suggest that pes interaction with _PROTEIN_ involves the pes n domain as well as other regions of pes . bifc analyses also revealed an interaction of _PROTEIN_ with ribosomal proteins _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ but not with _PROTEIN_ despite the high _PROTEIN_ of both _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in the infiltrated leaves . analyses of protein interactions of _PROTEIN_ . bifc analyses of _PROTEIN_ interaction with pes and _PROTEIN_ . proteins were co _PROTEIN_ as either _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ fusion proteins in n. benthamiana leaves using agroinfiltration . protoplasts were prepared from the infiltrated leaves and observed for _METHOD_ _METHOD_ after brief staining with dapi to visualize _LOCATION_ . bifc analyses of _PROTEIN_ interaction with ribosomal proteins . left confocal microscopy right immunoblot analysis . co immunoprecipitation . protein extracts were prepared from n. benthamiana leaves co _PROTEIN_ pes flag and _PROTEIN_ ha or myc _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ ha fusion proteins . extracts were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti ha antibody and co immunoprecipitated proteins were detected by immunoblotting with anti flag and anti myc antibodies . vigs phenotypes of _PROTEIN_ using three different _PROTEIN_ constructs in n. benthamiana at dai . real time quantitative rt pcr analysis of _PROTEIN_ transcript levels in trv _PROTEIN_ and trv _PROTEIN_ plants using _PROTEIN_ a and _PROTEIN_ b primers . the fourth leaf above the infiltrated leaf was used for the analysis . the tubulin mrna level was used as control . data represent the mean of three replicates per experiment . next co immunoprecipitation assays were performed . flag fused pes and haemagglutinin fused _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or myc fused _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ ha were _PROTEIN_ together in n. benthamiana leaves by agroinfiltration . _PROTEIN_ ha proteins were immunoprecipitated from cell extracts of infiltrated leaves with anti ha antibodies . following immunoprecipitation immunoblotting was first performed with anti ha antibodies to detect immunoprecipitated _PROTEIN_ ha and then with anti flag antibodies to detect pes flag as a co immunoprecipitant or with anti myc antibodies to detect myc _PROTEIN_ as a co immunoprecipitant . the results suggested that pes flag and myc _PROTEIN_ were co immunoprecipitated with _PROTEIN_ ha . however co immunoprecipitation did not occur when _PROTEIN_ ha was _PROTEIN_ alone . these results further support _PROTEIN_ interactions with pes and _PROTEIN_ in vivo . vigs phenotypes resulting from silencing of n. benthamiana _PROTEIN_ were examined in comparison with those of . the vigs constructs trv _PROTEIN_ trv _PROTEIN_ and trv _PROTEIN_ contained a full length coding region a n terminal region and a c terminal region of _PROTEIN_ cdna respectively . vigs of _PROTEIN_ in n. benthamiana resulted in growth retardation similar to that induced by vigs accompanied by mild leaf yellowing . real time quantitative rt pcr analyses detected lower levels of endogenous _PROTEIN_ transcripts in trv _PROTEIN_ and trv _PROTEIN_ leaves indicating _PROTEIN_ silencing in the vigs plants . to investigate the association of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ with ribosomes _PROTEIN_ its n terminal domain _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were _PROTEIN_ as _METHOD_ fusion proteins in n. benthamiana leaves by agroinfiltration . then leaf cells _PROTEIN_ these proteins were fractionated on a sucrose density gradient . after ultracentrifugation fractions were collected and immunoblot analysis was performed with anti _METHOD_ antibodies . as a control for fractionation another immunoblot analysis was performed with antibodies against the ribosomal protein _PROTEIN_ . _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ n and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ were enriched in fractions that contained large subunits and monosomes suggesting that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ may associate with ribosomes . these results also suggest that the _PROTEIN_ n terminal region is important for _PROTEIN_ association with ribosomes . co fractionation of _PROTEIN_ with ribosome subunits . _METHOD_ fusion proteins of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ n and _PROTEIN_ were _PROTEIN_ in n. benthamiana leaves by agroinfiltration . after sedimentation of ribosomes through a sucrose density gradient the fractions were analysed by immunoblotting with anti _METHOD_ and anti ribosomal protein _PROTEIN_ antibodies . lanes indicate the gradient fractions from the top to the bottom . positions of small subunits large subunits and monosomes are indicated . _PROTEIN_ is present in large subunits and monosomes . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was _PROTEIN_ in n. benthamiana leaves by agroinfiltration . ribosomal fractions were briefly treated with rnase a before sedimentation through a sucrose density gradient . because _PROTEIN_ can bind to rna it was examined whether _PROTEIN_ binds ribosomes via an rna tether . a brief rnase treatment of the ribosomal fractions inhibited _PROTEIN_ incorporation into the ribosomal fractions suggesting that its interaction with rrna contributes to _PROTEIN_ association with the ribosome subunits . _PROTEIN_ incorporation was not affected by the rnase treatment suggesting more stable association . cellular protein translation activity was examined using methionine labelling in wt arabidopsis and the dex inducible _PROTEIN_ rnai lines . seedlings were grown on media with or without dex for d briefly incubated with methionine and proteins were extracted . the radioactive protein profiles were obtained using _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ of the protein extracts and phosphorimager analysis . nascent protein synthesis in dex treated _PROTEIN_ rnai lines was reduced compared with dex rnai seedlings or dex treated wt seedlings . this result suggests that _PROTEIN_ deficiency leads to a reduction in protein synthesis . reduced global translation in _PROTEIN_ deficient plants . methionine labelling . after methionine labelling of arabidopsis rnai seedlings total protein extracts were separated by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and the gels were dried and analysed with a phosphorimager . a duplicate gel was stained with _METHOD_ blue to show the rubisco large subunit _PROTEIN_ as loading control . whole seedlings grown for d on dex or dex media were used for the analyses . polysome loading of _PROTEIN_ . sucrose density gradient fractions from n. benthamiana trv trv and trv _PROTEIN_ vigs plants were analysed by immunoblotting with anti _PROTEIN_ antibody . the fourth to fifth leaf above the infiltrated leaf was used for the analysis . positions of polysomes are indicated . lanes indicate the gradient fractions from the top to the bottom . the global translation activity in _PROTEIN_ deficient n. benthamiana plants was also examined by assessing polysomal loading of the ribosomal protein _PROTEIN_ . leaf extracts from trv trv and trv _PROTEIN_ vigs plants were sedimented through a sucrose density gradient . fractions were collected and immunoblot analysis of each fraction was performed using anti _PROTEIN_ antibody . trv and trv _PROTEIN_ plants had less _PROTEIN_ in the polysome fractions than the trv control suggesting that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ deficient leaf cells contained fewer polysomes and lower translation activity . immunoblotting using anti _PROTEIN_ antibody revealed that _PROTEIN_ protein levels in trv and trv _PROTEIN_ leaf cells were similar to the trv control level . the effect of _PROTEIN_ depletion on nascent rrna synthesis was examined using in vivo utp labelling . dex inducible _PROTEIN_ rnai arabidopsis seedlings were grown in media with ethanol or with dex for d. after incorporation of utp into nascent rna transcripts total rna was purified and separated by agarose gel electrophoresis . two _PROTEIN_ radioactive bands were detected which represented newly synthesized and rrnas . the ratio of rrna to rrna was calculated based on the band intensities of rrnas . the rrna ratios suggest that nascent synthesis of mature rrna was significantly reduced in dex treated _PROTEIN_ rnai samples . this result is consistent with delayed rrna processing in the _PROTEIN_ deficient nucleolus . delayed rrna processing and ribosome biogenesis in _PROTEIN_ deficient arabidopsis plants . whole seedlings grown for d on dex or dex media were used for the analyses . metabolic rrna labelling . seedlings were labelled with utp . total rna extracted from the seedlings was separated by agarose gel electrophoresis and analysed with a phosphorimager . newly synthesized mature and rrnas are marked . relative rrna ratio . band intensities of rrna and rrna in the samples shown in are compared . absorbance profiles of ribosomes at . ribosomes were purified from seedlings using ultracentrifugation on a sucrose density gradient . to investigate a potential role for _PROTEIN_ in ribosome biogenesis ribosome profiling was performed in the _PROTEIN_ rnai seedlings grown for d with or without dex . cell extracts were prepared from seedlings and fractionated with sucrose density ultracentrifugation and the resulting ribosome profile was measured at . peak height detected by a nm indicated the level of each ribosomal species . depletion of _PROTEIN_ resulted in reduced accumulation of large subunits and monosomes suggesting delayed assembly of functional subunits . collectively depletion of _PROTEIN_ caused delayed rrna maturation and ribosome biogenesis in plant cells . _PROTEIN_ deficiency caused growth retardation and gradual leaf yellowing in young arabidopsis plants . the premature senescence phenotype of the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ rnai seedlings was assessed . dex treated rnai seedlings had less chlorophyll than dex seedlings . this result was similar to that for vigs in n. benthamiana . the reduced chlorophyll content in dex treated seedlings correlated with lower photosynthetic activities as indicated by the optimum quantum yield . the f v/f m ratio reflects the maximal photochemical efficiency of photosystem ii . the f v/f m ratio in the leaves of dex rnai lines was significantly reduced compared with that of dex controls suggesting a reduction in functional photosystem ii centres . consistent with enhanced senescence of dex treated _PROTEIN_ rnai seedlings the seedlings also accumulated excessive amounts of reactive oxygen species visualized by nitro blue tetrazolium . nbt reacts with superoxide radicals to form a dark blue formazan precipitate . excessive ros formation in _PROTEIN_ deficient plants was further visualized by staining with which emits a green _METHOD_ signal in the presence of thus indicating oxidative stress in a cell . accumulation of green _METHOD_ in protoplasts from dex treated rnai seedlings was fold greater than in dex controls indicating high ros accumulation . premature senescence phenotypes of _PROTEIN_ deficient arabidopsis plants . the fifth rosette leaf of seedlings grown for d on dex or dex media was used for the analyses except in . chlorophyll content in arabidopsis dex inducible _PROTEIN_ rnai lines in response to dex treatment . f v/f m ratio in wt rnai and rnai plants . plants were grown for weeks in _METHOD_ medium containing either ethanol or dex then transferred to soil and sprayed with ethanol or dex for d. nitro blue tetrazolium staining to visualize superoxide production in rnai lines . staining to visualize production in rnai lines . after staining leaf protoplasts were observed under confocal microscopy . relative _METHOD_ was quantified by confocal microscopy . data represent the means sd of individual protoplasts . scale bars . rt pcr analyses of transcript levels of senescence related genes in wt rnai and rnai plants . the actin mrna level was used as the control . leaf senescence related gene _PROTEIN_ was analysed by rt pcr . dex treatment induced _PROTEIN_ of the senescence marker genes _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ rnai seedlings accompanied by up regulation of the senescence induced receptor kinase _PROTEIN_ and the senescence induced transcription _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ of the defence marker gene _PROTEIN_ and three autophagy related genes _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ remained unchanged . in accordance with a _PROTEIN_ in chlorophyll contents _PROTEIN_ of the chlorophyll biosynthetic genes _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ was reduced in _PROTEIN_ rnai seedlings in response to dex . collectively these gene _PROTEIN_ changes are in agreement with leaf senescence _METHOD_ observed in _PROTEIN_ silenced plants .
arabidopsis thaliana and n. benthamiana plants were grown in a growth chamber at under a dark cycle . for growth on agar seeds were surface sterilized and sown on petri dishes containing _METHOD_ medium with ethanol or with dex . to prepare radioactive and rrna probes the cdnas encoding full length and rrna were cloned into the pgem t easy vector . the constructs were digested with bamhi restriction enzyme and labelled rnas were prepared by in vitro transcription using rna polymerase . for rna binding assays the rna substrates were incubated with purified recombinant maltose binding protein fusion proteins in binding buffer _PROTEIN_ on ice for in the absence or presence of _PROTEIN_ . the reaction mixtures were loaded on a agarose gel and rna bands were visualized by a phosphorimager . using labelled methionine newly synthesized proteins were detected as described . metabolic labelling of rrna was performed according to et al . with modification . five seedlings each of wild type and dex inducible _PROTEIN_ rnai lines with or without dex treatment were incubated overnight with of utp that was diluted in of _METHOD_ liquid medium . total rna was extracted with a plant total rna kit according to the manufacturer s instructions . rna samples were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis and the agarose gel was dried and analysed with a phosphorimager . for polysomal loading analyses leaf extracts of tobacco rattle virus trv and trv _PROTEIN_ n. benthamiana vigs plants were fractionated through sucrose density gradients as described . total proteins were extracted from sucrose density gradient fractions and subjected to _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and immunoblotting with anti _PROTEIN_ antibodies . for co fractionation analyses _METHOD_ fusion proteins of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ n or _PROTEIN_ were _PROTEIN_ in n. benthamiana leaves by agroinfiltration and the leaf extracts were fractionated through sucrose density gradients . proteins extracted from the fractions were separated by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and subjected to immunoblotting with anti _METHOD_ antibodies and anti _PROTEIN_ antibodies . methods describing vigs generation of dex inducible _PROTEIN_ rnai lines in arabidopsis agrobacterium mediated transient _PROTEIN_ real time quantitative reverse transcription pcr bimolecular _METHOD_ complementation measurement of in vivo levels immunoblotting co immunoprecipitation purification of recombinant proteins _PROTEIN_ assay pulse amplitude modulation _PROTEIN_ fluorometry and statistical analyses are given in supplementary methods .
