root efflux to the outer medium is a component of net uptake and can even overcome influx upon various stresses . its role and molecular basis are unknown . following a functional biochemical approach _PROTEIN_ was identified by _METHOD_ _METHOD_ in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ of arabidopsis thaliana suspension cells a localization confirmed using a _PROTEIN_ green _METHOD_ protein fusion protein . _PROTEIN_ belongs to a subclass of seven naxt members from the large nitrate transporter family and is _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in the cortex of mature roots . the passive transport activity in isolated root pm electrically coupled to the _PROTEIN_ dependant h pumping activity is inhibited by anti naxt antibodies . in standard culture conditions contents were altered in plants _PROTEIN_ naxt interfering rnas but not in _PROTEIN_ mutant plants . upon acid load unidirectional root efflux markedly increased in wild type plants leading to a prolonged excretion regime concomitant with a _PROTEIN_ in root content . in vivo and in vitro mutant phenotypes revealed that this response is mediated by _PROTEIN_ whose _PROTEIN_ is upregulated at the posttranscriptional level . strong medium acidification generated a similar response . in vitro the passive efflux of was strongly impaired in _PROTEIN_ mutant pm . this identification of efflux transporters at the pm of plant cells opens the way to molecular studies of the physiological role of efflux in stressed or unstressed plants .
a functional biochemical strategy summarized in figure was launched on _METHOD_ isolated from tobacco and arabidopsis suspension cells to identify polypeptide candidate for the efflux activity . intrinsic _LOCATION_ proteins from cells were solubilized and separated in native conditions by iec . in each iec fraction image analysis of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ pattern was performed to determine the abundance of the different polypeptide bands and in parallel the efflux activity was measured after reinsertion of the whole protein content into liposomes . a correlation was then searched for between the abundance of each detected polypeptide band and the activity along successive iec fractions . two polypeptide bands of and kd _PROTEIN_ both present in the most active fraction were selected . attempts to obtain sequence data from and _PROTEIN_ by chemical microsequencing were unsuccessful . since and _PROTEIN_ did not appear to be glycosylated they were used to prepare rabbit polyclonal antisera . only polyclonal antibodies directed against _PROTEIN_ could ultimately be obtained . immunodetected two bands of and kd at a high signal to noise ratio and also a faint band at kd in _METHOD_ isolated from tobacco cells . importantly provided evidence for the existence of an ortholog of kd in the pm fraction from arabidopsis suspension cells . intrinsic pm proteins from arabidopsis cells were then separated by gfc/iec/sds _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ analysis of the immunodetected led to the identification of an as yet uncharacterized kd protein herein designated _PROTEIN_ . in the presence of a broad specificity plant protease inhibitor cocktail _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ clearly immunodetected a kd band in the _METHOD_ isolated from roots of arabidopsis . _METHOD_ analysis of a naxt enriched gfc/iec/sds _PROTEIN_ fraction of arabidopsis root _METHOD_ confirmed the presence of _PROTEIN_ in the immunodetected kd band . this indicated that both the and kd polypeptides previously immunodetected by were probably proteolytic products derived from the full length _PROTEIN_ protein . _PROTEIN_ is a highly hydrophobic protein harboring putative transmembrane segments and is predicted to localize in the pm according to psort . as illustrated in figure this protein belongs to the large _PROTEIN_ family which encompasses in particular uptake transporters . as can be deduced from figure _PROTEIN_ and six other _PROTEIN_ members constitute a distinct subclass of proteins that we named the naxt subfamily . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ share high similarity with _PROTEIN_ and naxt genes are organized as a cluster on chromosome . it is noteworthy that all members possess a specific amino acid stretch dinhgrvdnvy . except for whose _PROTEIN_ is undetectable in shoots or roots all naxt genes are _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis roots _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . in particular _PROTEIN_ is preferentially _PROTEIN_ in this organ . root pm was isolated from week old arabidopsis plants grown on standard hydroponics and the activity of the root pm h _PROTEIN_ was assayed in vitro in double labeling experiments with _METHOD_ probes for and em . using inside out _LOCATION_ vesicles loaded with mm k and outer medium without permeant anions energization of the h _PROTEIN_ triggered a slow acidification rate of the vesicle lumen and a large em . the h pump was slowed by the high em it created indicating that the active entry of h charges was not easily compensated by an equivalent release of k charges despite the high k vesicle content . addition of the k ionophore valinomycin triggered a complete depolarization of the vesicles and a high h pumping rate . the short circuiting effect of valinomycin was not sustained because vesicles were depleted progressively in k . by contrast addition of a low concentration to the outside also depolarized the vesicles triggering a high and sustained h pumping rate because the external concentration remained constant . this shows that arabidopsis root pm contains a highly conductive pathway for enabling an em driven entry of negative charges associated with transport making em less positive . thus this pathway corresponds to a passive transport which efficiently compensates the active entry of h charges . since is transported in the same direction as the pumped h this activity should enable in situ a efflux at the root pm . the dependent h pumping rate can be taken as an estimate of the equivalent rate of passively transported . measurement of initial rates of acidification in the presence of increasing concentrations showed that is saturable with a michaelis constant of mm . attempts to obtain _PROTEIN_ specific antibodies were unsuccessful due to the high similarity between naxt members and their high sequence hydrophobicity . therefore rabbit polyclonal antibodies potentially directed against all naxt members were prepared from a mixture of three _PROTEIN_ derived synthetic peptides and further immunopurified against the peptides . the resulting polyclonal antibodies _PROTEIN_ detected the same kd band in arabidopsis root _METHOD_ detected previously with . the ability of and _PROTEIN_ antibodies to specifically inhibit the efflux activity in vitro was tested using a previously established functional assay . as a positive control polyclonal anti pm _PROTEIN_ antibodies designated here _PROTEIN_ inhibited by > the maximum rate of h excretion by the h _PROTEIN_ short circuited with the k ionophore valinomycin . conversely as expected this activity was not affected significantly by _PROTEIN_ at an identical igg protein ratio . in the presence of _PROTEIN_ and at a igg protein ratio _PROTEIN_ by and respectively whereas no inhibition was observed with preimmune antibodies . in the presence of _PROTEIN_ and at a igg protein ratio inhibition levels reached and respectively relative to in the presence of api . this indicates that most of the efflux activity in root pm vesicles is mediated by naxt proteins . rna interference transgenic plants impaired in the _PROTEIN_ of all naxt members were obtained . although no growth phenotype was observed contents of naxt rnai plants grown in vitro on standard murashige and skoog medium were altered significantly compared with those of wild type plants . this indicates that one or several naxt members are involved in the distribution of in plants . transient _PROTEIN_ of a _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ fusion construct in arabidopsis protoplasts revealed the localization of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein in the pm consistent with the previous identification of the _PROTEIN_ protein in a purified pm fraction . _PROTEIN_ gene _PROTEIN_ was stronger in roots than in shoots . localization of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in root tissues was investigated using transgenic arabidopsis plants _PROTEIN_ gus fusion constructs harboring the _PROTEIN_ gene under the transcriptional control of the _PROTEIN_ promoter . because of the small size of the upstream intergenic region short and long versions of the _PROTEIN_ promoter sequence were used and nucleotides upstream of the _PROTEIN_ open reading frame _PROTEIN_ respectively . in d old seedlings _PROTEIN_ the gus reporter gene no difference in gus patterns was observed between the two types of constructs . this suggests that the nucleotide sequence contained all of the necessary information for _PROTEIN_ tissue localization . analysis of gus staining was performed at three developmental stages on d old d old and week old plants . although cotyledons were stained to some extent most of the staining was found in the mature root zone . in roots of week old plants grown in hydroponics _PROTEIN_ diminished staining was observed in the oldest part of the primary root while secondary roots and younger parts of the primary root were still strongly stained . this may reflect the _PROTEIN_ that young roots are generally considered to have higher nutrient transport activity than old roots . root tips were not stained and gus staining in the mature root was observed _PROTEIN_ in cortical cells and to a lesser extent in epidermal cells . these results show that _PROTEIN_ is essentially _PROTEIN_ in the mature root cortex and are consistent with the hypothesis that _PROTEIN_ is involved in root efflux to the external medium . light and plant n status both known to regulate the gene _PROTEIN_ of major uptake transporters such as _PROTEIN_ did not affect _PROTEIN_ gene _PROTEIN_ in hydroponically grown plants . phenotypes resulting from the alteration of _PROTEIN_ gene _PROTEIN_ were searched for in standard culture conditions using _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ two t dna insertion lines _PROTEIN_ in which the mrna of _PROTEIN_ was undetectable . wild type and _PROTEIN_ plants displayed no significant difference in root and shoot growth in root and shoot contents in unidirectional root efflux and influx and in passive transport activity in vitro . consequently although some naxt members are involved in passive transport and in root/shoot distribution the contribution of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ negligible in plants grown in standard conditions . it was hypothesized that the absence of an apparent transport phenotype was the result of inappropriate phenotyping conditions . previous studies had revealed that in isolated root _METHOD_ efflux is tightly coupled to h excretion by the h _PROTEIN_ and that both efflux and h excretion activities share similar acidic optimum ph at the _LOCATION_ face of the pm . also in vivo stimulation of h excretion upon acid load is a well established feature of the pm h _PROTEIN_ . in search for a phenotype in _PROTEIN_ mutant plants the assumption that acid load could also stimulate root efflux was addressed experimentally . using the isotope unidirectional root efflux and influx were determined on the same plants as described previously . propionate a permeant weak acid widely used for plant cell acid loading was added to the plant nutrient medium . the _LOCATION_ ph is known to _PROTEIN_ within a few minutes after the addition of propionate but preliminary tests indicated that longer times of acid load were required to reveal a _PROTEIN_ phenotype . in wild type roots was higher after min of acid load compared with unloaded controls . this increase was abolished in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . unexpectedly largely exceeded in wild type and _PROTEIN_ unloaded controls showing that even control plants underwent a excretion regime . however root contents measured prior to and min after plant transfer in the assay medium were similar indicating that the excretion regime was transient in the absence of acid load . this transient excretion is likely attributable to the transplant shock subsequent to the transfer of plants to the assay medium performed just prior to and measurements . indeed mechanical stress almost instantaneously triggers a excretion due to a strong increase in the efflux which recovers its basal value within a few minutes the influx being unaffected . here _PROTEIN_ does not seem to be involved in the transient excretion observed after plant transfer because and contents of wild type and _PROTEIN_ roots were very similar in unloaded controls . by contrast min after the addition of propionate to the nutrient medium the root content _PROTEIN_ by in the wild type whereas it was not affected in either the _PROTEIN_ or the _PROTEIN_ mutant . furthermore it _PROTEIN_ by in a _PROTEIN_ mutant complemented with the _PROTEIN_ coding sequence _PROTEIN_ constitutively under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus promoter harboring a duplicated enhancer sequence . thus acid load is responsible for prolonged root excretion mediated by _PROTEIN_ leading to a marked _PROTEIN_ in root content . this is the reason for the designation of this protein as naxt . prolonged acid load could not be easily used in vivo to investigate its effect on because of the large and rapid _PROTEIN_ in root content . therefore efflux activity in vitro was measured on root pm isolated from plants acid loaded for or h. in wild type _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ controls was indistinguishable consistent with the absence of an efflux phenotype observed previously in planta . by contrast was higher by and in wild type pm after and h of acid load respectively . this increase was impaired in both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants showing that the increase in observed in wild type pm upon acid load resulted from the induction of a _PROTEIN_ mediated activity . the acid load mediated functional response described above was not related to an upregulation of _PROTEIN_ gene _PROTEIN_ because the _PROTEIN_ transcript level remained stable upon acid load of wild type roots . since no _PROTEIN_ specific antibodies were available to directly investigate _PROTEIN_ protein level in the wild type protein gel blot signals of root pm from the wild type and _PROTEIN_ mutants were compared using _PROTEIN_ . no significant difference was observed between these plants when grown in standard conditions in agreement with the absence of a mutant phenotype reported above . by contrast the intensity of the naxt band increased significantly after h of acid load in the wild type but not in the two _PROTEIN_ mutants suggesting that _PROTEIN_ accumulates in the wild type pm upon acid load . the intensity of the naxt band also increased in the whole _LOCATION_ fraction upon acid load showing that the _PROTEIN_ accumulation in the pm is unlikely to result from its relocalization from another storage _LOCATION_ compartment . the acid load dependent accumulation of _PROTEIN_ in the wild type pm was then monitored in transformed plants constitutively _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ coding sequence under the control of the promoter . in complemented _PROTEIN_ plants the naxt band _PROTEIN_ increased after acid load suggesting that the accumulation of _PROTEIN_ transcript and protein is uncoupled . in a transgenic line constitutively _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ tagged with the epitope the _PROTEIN_ fusion protein also accumulated after acid load . this demonstrates that the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ is regulated at the posttranscriptional level . medium acidification can be considered a biologically more relevant treatment than acid load artificially generated with propionate . acidification of the barley root hydroponic medium was shown to have little effect on influx but markedly stimulated efflux . in particular a net excretion regime was observed in mm mes buffer at ph . we hypothesized that medium acidification could be responsible for an acidic drift of the _LOCATION_ ph and induce a response similar to that observed upon acid load . indeed _LOCATION_ bilayers display a surprisingly high permeability coefficient to h . moreover accounting for the large em of root cells a strong passive entry of h within root cells is expected at ph . consistently wild type root content _PROTEIN_ by almost after acidification of the plant nutrient medium for min at ph whereas it was not affected significantly in either _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ mutant roots . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ remained stable upon medium acidification whereas protein gel blot analyses showed a marked increase in the intensity of the naxt band in wild type but not in _PROTEIN_ root pm . these data indicate that like acid load medium acidification induces prolonged root excretion mediated by _PROTEIN_ which is also upregulated at the posttranscriptional level . some intrinsic properties of the efflux were also determined on root pm of plants treated at ph using a transport assay independent of the h _PROTEIN_ . as detailed in supplemental figure online the rate of passive flux was determined from the rate of dependent dissipation of imposed diffusion em monitored quantitatively with oxonol vi . in wild type pm assayed between ph and revealed an optimal ph at . in _PROTEIN_ was negligible compared with in the wild type at ph showing that essentially _PROTEIN_ operates at this optimal acidic ph . by contrast _PROTEIN_ was not affected significantly in passive flux showing that _PROTEIN_ is not competent for .
tobacco cell suspensions were cultured in the dark at in murashige and skoog medium ph containing murashige and skoog salt mg/l thiamine hcl mg/l dichlorophenylacetic acid mg/l myo inositol g/l sucrose mg/l and g/l mes . cells were _PROTEIN_ by weekly dilution into fresh medium . arabidopsis thaliana ecotype columbia cell suspensions were cultured under continuous light at in jouanneau and lenoel medium as described . they were subcultured with a dilution _PROTEIN_ every d and used for _LOCATION_ isolation at d after transfer . for gus analyses of and d old plants and to phenotype d old naxt rnai plants arabidopsis plants were grown in vitro in twofold diluted murashige and skoog culture medium . for other analyses arabidopsis plants were grown for weeks in hydroponic conditions as described . unless stated otherwise the source of was mm . acid load treatment was performed by adding k propionate in the plant nutrient medium . medium acidification treatment was performed by adding in the nutrient medium and the ph was controlled every hour . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ t dna insertion mutants of the _PROTEIN_ locus are from the signal collection at the salk institute . seeds were obtained from the european arabidopsis stock center . the nature and location of the t dna insert was confirmed by sequencing the pcr products . two sets of pcr were performed one using two _PROTEIN_ specific primers located on either side of the t dna insert the other using a _PROTEIN_ specific primer and a left border t dna primer . this made it possible to determine whether the individual was homozygous for no t dna insertion heterozygous for the t dna insertion or homozygous for the t dna insertion . tobacco and arabidopsis cells in suspension were disrupted at in a high pressure device at constant pressure of bar _METHOD_ in buffer containing mm benzamidin leupeptin mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and the anti protease cocktail referred to as _PROTEIN_ and pm was then isolated at the interface of a discontinuous sucrose gradient as described . root pm was similarly isolated from to g fresh weight of roots of arabidopsis plants harvested weeks after sowing except that root tissues were disrupted in a waring blendor for to s in buffer containing a plant anti protease cocktail _PROTEIN_ and anti phosphatases . alternatively to g fresh weight of roots was ground in liquid nitrogen in a mortar and the resulting powder was resuspended and additionally homogenized in a potter device in the same buffer . the whole _LOCATION_ fraction was pelleted after centrifugation at for min . pm from tobacco cells was pretreated with triton x to eliminate proteins loosely associated with the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . the remaining _LOCATION_ proteins were solubilized by zwittergent at a detergent protein ratio of for min under gentle stirring and the supernatant of a k pellet was fractionated by rapid iec on either a monoq hr ml or a protein pack q hr column with discontinuous kcl gradients . protein fractions from tobacco pm were reconstituted into liposomes at a lipid protein ratio of as described to determine the efflux and permeability coefficient to using oxonol vi dye . the pm from arabidopsis suspension cells was stripped and intrinsic proteins were solubilized by n dodecyl d maltoside and separated by gfc/iec/sds _PROTEIN_ as described . protein separation by _PROTEIN_ was performed according to citation . gels stained with _METHOD_ brilliant blue r were scanned and analyzed using imagemaster elite software . candidate polypeptide bands were excised from the gel digested with trypsin and analyzed by _PROTEIN_ assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight _METHOD_ as described . in vivo root unidirectional efflux and influx were measured according to citation using a _METHOD_ spectrometer _METHOD_ especially fitted with a channel calibrated for accurate measurement of ratio in the to range to determine and with another classical channel for accurate measurement in the to range to determine . this setup made it possible to measure both and on the same plants . the concentration in the labeling solution was the same as in the culture medium except that a ratio was fixed at the beginning of the experiment . then was determined from the amount of incorporated into the roots during a short period and was determined from the dilution of in the labeling solution by originating from the roots during the same period . in vitro passive transport activity was measured on isolated pm vesicles _PROTEIN_ by one of two different means . in the first method vesicles were _PROTEIN_ by activating pm h _PROTEIN_ in ionic conditions in which the initial h excretion rate of the pump is greatly restricted by em . addition of to pm vesicles competent for passive transport then depolarizes the vesicles triggering an increase of vh attributable to a passive equivalent entry of . em and were monitored with the oxonol vi and acma _METHOD_ dyes respectively . in the second method vesicles were _PROTEIN_ by imposing li diffusion gradients in the presence of the ionophore and em was quantitatively monitored using oxonol vi . comparison of the slow dissipation kinetics of em in the absence and presence of allowed us to determine passive flux . the two transport assays were performed as described except that they were scaled down to a microplate format . functional inhibition assays with antibodies were performed as described . the antibodies were isolated from an antiserum obtained as described by citation after injection into a rabbit of the kd _PROTEIN_ protein band isolated from a fast protein liquid chromatography fraction that correlated with naxt activity . _PROTEIN_ was obtained after coinjection of the three keyhole limpet hemocyanin coupled synthetic peptides and into rabbits and immunopurification of the resulting antiserum against the peptides . except for the _PROTEIN_ iggs and for commercial antibodies all antibodies used were iggs purified from rabbit antisera using the melon gel igg spin purification kit according to the manufacturer 's instructions . alkaline phosphatase coupled anti rabbit and anti mouse antibodies were from promega and the anti monoclonal antibody was from ebioscience . protein gel blot analysis was performed according to the icn biomedicals aurora protocol except that the duration of the washing steps was doubled and the alkaline phosphatase substrate cdp star was used . both primary and secondary antibodies were used at a dilution . chemiluminescent signals were acquired using _METHOD_ or a _PROTEIN_ ccd imager . naxt protein sequences were aligned using the muscle algorithm included in the biopen sequence analysis software for macintosh . protein sequences from members of the _PROTEIN_ family were extracted from the plantst database and redundant sequences were removed .

sequence deduced from the orf dna sequence was identical to that of the columbia ortholog except for a single physicochemically conservative r to k substitution at amino acid . the naxt rnai construct was obtained as follows . a bp long orf cdna sequence of _PROTEIN_ was chosen for the rnai construct because it is highly conserved among other naxt members . this cdna fragment was amplified by pcr from using primers and . the pcr fragment was digested by xhoi/kpni and cloned into the silencing vector phannibal digested with the same enzymes leading to . to integrate another copy of this _PROTEIN_ fragment but in the opposite orientation and on the other side of the _PROTEIN_ intron in the vector the original pcr fragment was digested by xbai/clai and cloned in digested with the same enzymes resulting in construct . the naxt rnai cassette containing the camv promoter the _PROTEIN_ sequence in the positive orientation the _PROTEIN_ intron the _PROTEIN_ sequence in the negative orientation and the octopine synthase terminator was excised from with noti and cloned into the plant transformation vector pgreen . the resulting construct was used for agrobacterium tumefaciens mediated transformation of arabidopsis plants . among independent homozygous naxt rnai lines one was selected because it displayed the lowest _PROTEIN_ levels for all naxt genes . the gus construct was obtained as follows . the sequence of bp upstream of the _PROTEIN_ initiation codon that constitutes the entire intergenic region between the _PROTEIN_ gene and the upstream gene was amplified by pcr from arabidopsis genomic dna using the primers x and pronr . the amplified fragment was digested by xbai/ncoi and cloned into the plant transformation vector pcambia digested with the same enzymes . this led to clone harboring the gus gene under the transcriptional control of the _PROTEIN_ promoter sequence . another fusion construct with a larger promoter sequence _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was obtained and displayed similar gus patterns . the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ construct was obtained as follows . the _PROTEIN_ orf was amplified by pcr from using the primers and . the resulting fragment was digested with bamhi and cloned into the bamhi site of the _METHOD_ vector . this led to clone in which the stop codon of _PROTEIN_ was mutated to a ser codon leading to a c terminal translational fusion between the _PROTEIN_ orf and the downstream _METHOD_ gene . the _PROTEIN_ mutant complemented with _PROTEIN_ was obtained as follows . the _PROTEIN_ orf sequence was amplified by pcr from using the primers and . the pcr fragment was first cloned into pbsk a generous gift from d. luu . this plasmid is a pbluescript vector in which the saci xbai and xhoi sites were first inactivated and in which a promoter rbcs terminator cassette was inserted into the ecori/clai sites after excision from pkylx . this insertion reintroduced new unique xhoi xbai and saci sites between the promoter and terminator sequences . the _PROTEIN_ orf pcr fragment was cloned in the xbai site and constructs with inserts in the correct orientation with respect to promoter and terminator sequences were selected . the _PROTEIN_ rbcs cassette was then excised with spei/kpni and subcloned into the binary vector digested with xbai/kpni . the resulting construct was used for agrobacterium mediated transformation of the _PROTEIN_ mutant . the _PROTEIN_ construct was obtained as follows . the _PROTEIN_ orf sequence was fused to the dna of the epitope by pcr amplification from using the primers and . this resulted in the mutation of the _PROTEIN_ stop codon into a codon for ser the first amino acid residue of the epitope . the amplified fragment was digested by xhoi/saci and cloned into pbsk digested by the same enzymes . the _PROTEIN_ rbcs cassette was then excised with spei/kpni and subcloned into the binary vector digested with xbai/kpni . the resulting construct was used for agrobacterium mediated transformation of wild type plants . all constructs were verified by sequencing . arabidopsis plants were transformed using the floral dip immersion protocol described by citation . transient
