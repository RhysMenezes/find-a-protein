cell plate formation during plant cytokinesis is facilitated by snare complex mediated vesicle fusion at the cell division plane . however our knowledge _PROTEIN_ r snare components of _LOCATION_ fusion machinery for cell plate formation remains quite limited . we report the in vivo function of arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ two closely sequence related r snares in cell plate formation . double homozygous _PROTEIN_ mutant seedlings showed lethal dwarf phenotypes and were characterized by rudimentary roots cotyledons and hypocotyls . furthermore cell wall stubs and incomplete cytokinesis were frequently observed in _PROTEIN_ seedlings . confocal images revealed that green _METHOD_ protein tagged _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were preferentially localized to the expanding cell plates in dividing cells . drug treatments and co localization analyses demonstrated that punctuate organelles labeled with _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ represented early endosomes overlapped with vha labeled tgn which were distinct from _LOCATION_ stacks and prevacuolar compartments . in addition protein traffic to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ but not to the _LOCATION_ was severely disrupted in _PROTEIN_ seedlings by subcellular localization of marker proteins . these observations suggest that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are involved in secretory trafficking to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ via tgn/early endosomal compartment which contributes substantially to cell plate formation during plant cytokinesis .
no obvious differences in plant growth were observed among single _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutants heterozygous double mutants and wild type control plants . interestingly we identified _PROTEIN_ double homozygous mutant seedlings in the progeny of self fertilized heterozygous double mutant plants based on genotyping and rt pcr . . as shown in the _PROTEIN_ seedlings arrested d after germination and grew extreme rudimentary roots hypocotyls and cotyledons thus leading to seedling death days _PROTEIN_ . moreover compared with wild type seedlings _PROTEIN_ mutant roots exhibited disorganized root tips including abnormal meristematic cells and root caps . the incorporation of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ translational fusion gene under control of the native promoter into _PROTEIN_ / _PROTEIN_ / plants fully rescued the seedling lethality phenotype in the double homozygous mutant confirming that the phenotypic alterations were due to the t dna insertions in the two genes . schematic structures of

d old wild type and _PROTEIN_ mutant seedlings under dark growth are shown . bars . to gain insights into _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ function the root longitudinal sections were prepared and compared . as a result _PROTEIN_ mutant seedlings exhibited disordered cell file alignment with cell wall stubs or gaps in comparison with wild type plants implying that the cell division patterns were severely affected . when root tips were stained with calcofluor and propidium iodide for cell walls and _LOCATION_ respectively of root cells in wild type seedlings displayed normal cytokinesis characterized by one _LOCATION_ within a single cell and complete cell walls . however the root cells of _PROTEIN_ seedlings displayed a high incidence of binucleate cells and ruptured cell walls with the frequencies of and as opposed to and in the wild type plants . similar to the wild type of root cells in complemented double mutant showed normal cytokinesis . furthermore cell wall stubs were frequently observed in the cotyledon epidermal cells of _PROTEIN_ mutants compared to wild type seedlings . and toluidine blue o stained root longitudinal sections of wild type and _PROTEIN_ seedlings

analysis of growing cell plates stained with in root tips of to d old wild type and _PROTEIN_ seedlings . arrows indicate the growing or arrested cell plates . bars . to determine whether loss function of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ affected cell plate expansion we traced the process of cell plate formation using time lapse analysis by staining root tips of wild type and _PROTEIN_ mutant seedlings with . as shown in _LOCATION_ structures in root cells stained with surrounded the cell division plane prior to cell plate emergence in wild type seedlings . after min a cell plate labeled with was apparently observed at the division plane . during the _LOCATION_ fusion process two edges of the cell plate continually expanded outward and finally anchored to parental _LOCATION_ at min . in contrast root cells of _PROTEIN_ seedlings exhibited asymmetric initiation of the cell plate at the beginning . cell plate expansion was not detected after increasing the staining duration . even after min cell plates in _PROTEIN_ root cells slightly or rarely expanded . to examine the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ we created transgenic plants in which n terminal _METHOD_ or mcherry tagged _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ translational fusions were _PROTEIN_ respectively under the control of their native promoters in wild type background . under the confocal microscope we found that both _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ obviously appeared at expanding cell plates and postcytokinetic walls which were merged with labeled _LOCATION_ in root meristematic cells . we also found a similar labeling pattern in cotyledon epidermal cells . to get deep insight into the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ cytokinetic localization the root meristematic cells of to d old arabidopsis seedlings were monitored to visualize the process of cell plate formation . during the onset of cytokinesis the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ signal was strongly associated with the newly formed cell plate at the middle of the division plane and the organelles labeled with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ surrounded the cell plate . along with the process of cytokinesis _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ substantially accumulated at the entire cell plate and two edges of the cell plate expanded symmetrically outward before anchoring with the mother wall . after complete fusion of both cell plate edges with the parental pm _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ still remained associated with the postcytokinetic wall and its intensity gradually _PROTEIN_ to the level of the surrounding cells after min . and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ label the expanding cell plates and postcytokinetic walls which are merged with the _LOCATION_ labeled with . bars . and time series of growing cell plates in root tip cells stained with . _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ signals are localized to the cell plates during the progression of cytokinesis . bars . as expected _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ displayed a similar cytokinetic localization pattern to _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . as shown in the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ signal was apparently associated with the emerging cell plate at the division plane soon after the onset of cytokinesis . _LOCATION_ organelles labeled with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ were distributed in the vicinity of the cell plate during the process of cytokinesis . two edges of the cell plate attached simultaneously to the parental pm at min . soon after that the cell plate completed fusion with the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and the _METHOD_ signal _PROTEIN_ and appeared evenly along the entire cell plate . we further quantified the phenotypes of cell plate formation in cytokinetic root tip cells of control _PROTEIN_ and complemented double mutant seedlings by the _METHOD_ labeling . as expected colocalization at the cell plates and postcytokinetic walls was observed in the root cytokinetic cells co _PROTEIN_ cytokinesis specific marker _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and mcherry _PROTEIN_ . therefore we used the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ transgenic lines as the control . the results showed that of cell plates in control cells exhibited symmetric assembly or complete formation . however abnormal and asymmetric cell plate assemblies were scored highly in and of _PROTEIN_ cytokinetic root cells labeled with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ consistent with the observation that the double mutant frequently showed disordered cell file alignment and cell wall stubs . similar to the control of the mitotic root cells in complemented double mutant showed normal cell plate formation monitored by _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ .

double mutant seedlings rescued by _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . bars . apart from the cell plate localization we also found that _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ were frequently distributed to the cytoplasmic endosomes . to define the endosomes labeled with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ we first use the trafficking inhibitor brefeldin a a fungal macrocyclic lactone which targets _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ arf gefs thus inhibiting the function of arf _PROTEIN_ and induces heterogeneous aggregations of early endosomal _LOCATION_ in plants . when root tips were treated with bfa plus the endosomes labeled with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ were induced to form aggregates that colocalized with positive bfa compartments labeled with endocytic . similar results were obtained when _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ labeled root tip cells were treated with bfa . we further found that bfa treatment induced _LOCATION_ aggregates labeled with vha _METHOD_ a tgn/early endosome marker . however the _LOCATION_ marker n _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ did not enter the bfa compartments but instead surrounded enriched bfa compartments . d old seedlings were pre incubated in bfa for min before incubation in bfa plus for another min . and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ relocated to bfa compartments labeled with . bars . vha _METHOD_ labeled tgn was sensitive to bfa treatment and colocalized with bfa compartment from . bars . was accumulated into the core of bfa compartment surrounded by the _LOCATION_ marker n _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ after bfa treatment . bars . seedlings were incubated with wortmannin for min . _METHOD_ was used as the control . bars . in contrast to the control the pvc marker _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was induced to form small _LOCATION_ after wortmannin treatment . bars . and similar to the _METHOD_ control the organelles labeled with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ were not changed following wortmannin treatment . bars . confocal laser scanning microscopy _PROTEIN_ analysis of seedling root epidermal cells co _PROTEIN_ the _LOCATION_ marker n _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or pvc marker _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ as indicated and mcherry _PROTEIN_ or mcherry _PROTEIN_ as indicated . co localization analysis showed that mcherry _PROTEIN_ and mcherry _PROTEIN_ labeled organelles were closely associated with _LOCATION_ stacks in and . similarly as shown in and mcherry _PROTEIN_ and mcherry _PROTEIN_ labeled organelles were also distinct from the pvc marker _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . bars . to determine whether the endosomes labeled with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ belong to the prevacuolar compartment /late endosome _PROTEIN_ we further used wortmannin an inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol kinase which targets the pvc/le that then dilates and blocks the traffic to _LOCATION_ in plants . after treatment with wortmannin at for min in the transgenic root tip cells we observed that the pvc marker _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was induced to form small _LOCATION_ which are the representative wortmannin treatment structures . in contrast wortmannin treatment did not cause visible changes of the organelles labeled with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in size or number similar to the results in _METHOD_ control . in the root cells co _PROTEIN_ mcherry tagged _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ marker of _LOCATION_ mcherry _PROTEIN_ labeled organelles were in physical proximity with the _LOCATION_ marked with n _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . for root cells co labeled with mcherry _PROTEIN_ and the pvc marker _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ we found that the organelles labeled with mcherry _PROTEIN_ were often transiently close to but distinct from the pvc . similarly the organelles labeled with mcherry _PROTEIN_ were distinct from the _LOCATION_ apparatus and pvc markers . in arabidopsis lipophilic styryl dye is internalized from _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ to lytic _LOCATION_ within to h via passing through a variety of endosomes along the endocytosis . when was applied to root tips _PROTEIN_ the early endosome marker vha _METHOD_ extensive colocalization was observed in epidermal cells after uptake for min . in contrast the internalized did not colocalize with pvc labeled with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ after min although they were adjacent to each other . even after min _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ labeled pvc showed very limited colocalization with the internalized . however internalized colocalized mostly with transgenes labeled endosomes after min in cells _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ or _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ similar to the labeling pattern of the vha _METHOD_ compartment . to unveil the spatial relationship between the _PROTEIN_ and vha compartments we crossed plants _PROTEIN_ mcherry _PROTEIN_ or mcherry _PROTEIN_ with the vha _METHOD_ lines . under the confocal microscope we observed that mcherry _PROTEIN_ and vha _METHOD_ exhibited overlapping _LOCATION_ distributions . similarly _METHOD_ signals from mcherry _PROTEIN_ were colocalized with those of vha _METHOD_ . root tip cells _PROTEIN_ vha _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ or _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ incubated with for the times indicated . pink arrows indicate _METHOD_ labeled regions without detectable labeling yellow arrows indicate labeled regions without detectable _METHOD_ signal white arrows indicate regions with extensive colocalization between _METHOD_ and signals . bars . and confocal laser scanning microscopy analysis of root epidermal cells coexpressing vha _METHOD_ and mcherry _PROTEIN_ or mcherry _PROTEIN_ . bars . concanamycina is a _LOCATION_ permeable macrolide antibiotics that binds to the v _PROTEIN_ subunits c and inhibits proton transport . it has been demonstrated that conca blocks trafficking at the tgn which affects cell plate formation in arabidopsis . when conca was applied to root tip cells the organelles labeled with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ were clearly trapped in _LOCATION_ aggregates . as expected the conca treatment retarded the expansion of the cell plate labeled with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ leading to cell wall stub as shown in . similarly we found that conca treatment induced a _METHOD_ intracellular accumulation of the endosomes labeled with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . furthermore cell wall stubs with irregular direction and _PROTEIN_ surrounded with swollen structures were observed in conca treated root dividing cells _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . however these _METHOD_ signals were localized to the normal expanding cell plates in untreated dividing cells . _METHOD_ imaging of root cells . the cell outlines were stained with . compared with the expanding cell plates in controls and conca treatment for h induced intracellular accumulation of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and prevented the cell plate formation indicated with arrowheads in and . bars . the role of de novo secretory trafficking in plant cytokinesis has been emphasized . the occurrence of incomplete cell plate in _PROTEIN_ seedlings and their _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ localization imply that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ probably are involved in the secretory trafficking to the _LOCATION_ membrae . in _PROTEIN_ mutant seedlings _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ marker protein _METHOD_ we observed an abnormal accumulation of _METHOD_ signals in the cytoplasm of root epidermal cells . even at a higher resolution we did not detect colocalization between _METHOD_ and staining at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . similarly we observed _METHOD_ signals inside aberrant intracellular compartments in _PROTEIN_ roots _PROTEIN_ another pm marker _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . in contrast _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ showed clear pm localization overlapping with the staining at low or high magnification in control plants . however the cells _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in _PROTEIN_ mutant displayed similar tonoplast labeling patterns to that of controls in roots
