this is the first report describing the cloning and characterization of sterol carrier protein _PROTEIN_ from plants . arabidopsis thaliana _PROTEIN_ consists of amino acids with a molecular _METHOD_ of kda . atscp shows identity and similarity to the human _PROTEIN_ like domain present in the human d bifunctional protein and identity and similarity to the human _PROTEIN_ encoded by _PROTEIN_ x . the presented structural models of apo atscp and the ligand bound conformation of atscp reveal remarkable similarity with two of the structurally known _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ like domain of human dbp and the rabbit _PROTEIN_ correspondingly . the atscp models in both _METHOD_ have a similar hydrophobic ligand binding tunnel which is extremely suitable for lipid binding . atscp showed in vitro transfer activity of bodipy phosphatidylcholine from donor _LOCATION_ to acceptor _LOCATION_ . the transfer of bodipy pc was almost completely inhibited after addition of palmitoyl oleoyl phosphatidylcholine or _LOCATION_ . dimyristoyl phosphatidic acid stigmasterol steryl _PROTEIN_ and cholesterol showed a moderate to marginal ability to lower the bodipy pc transfer rate and the single chain palmitic acid and stearoyl coenzyme a did not affect transfer at all . _PROTEIN_ analysis showed that atscp mrna is accumulating in most plant tissues . plasmids carrying fusion genes between green _METHOD_ protein and atscp were transformed with particle bombardment to onion epidermal cells . the results from analyzing the transformants indicate that atscp is localized to _LOCATION_ .
identification of an a. thaliana protein similar to sterol carrier protein we reported the initial characterization of the endosperm proteome of euphorbia lagascae and its changes during seed germination . in that study we used two dimensional gels to visualize proteins accumulating in the endosperm of e. lagascae seeds during germination . one of the e. lagascae proteins showed similarity to a putative protein _GENE_ with unidentified function from a. thaliana . when we used the a. thaliana sequence to search the public sequence data bases such as we identified that it showed significant similarity to dbp from mammals . a closer look at the results from the blast searches revealed that the similarities were restricted to the _PROTEIN_ like domain of dbp . the a. thaliana _GENE_ protein shows identity and similarity to the human _PROTEIN_ like domain present in dbp and identity and similarity to the human _PROTEIN_ encoded by _PROTEIN_ x . from now on we will refer to _GENE_ as a. thaliana _PROTEIN_ . atscp consists of amino acids has a theoretical pi of and a molecular _METHOD_ of kda . the molecular _METHOD_ of human _PROTEIN_ is kda and pi has been determined to . atscp contains a peroxisomal targeting signal skl in the c terminus which suggests that the _LOCATION_ are the _PROTEIN_ cellular location for the protein . the gene encoding atscp is located on chromosome in the a. thaliana genome . the gene is a separate gene that is not fused to any other gene . we have not identified any other genes encoding _PROTEIN_ domains or _PROTEIN_ like proteins in the completely sequenced a. thaliana genome . identification of cdnas encoding _PROTEIN_ like proteins from other used the a. thaliana sequence to search data bases for _PROTEIN_ sequence tags that encoded _PROTEIN_ like proteins from other plants . we succeeded in identifying such sequence tags from the moss physcomitrella patens from conifers monocotyledons and many other dicotyledons suggesting that a _PROTEIN_ like protein is _PROTEIN_ in most plants . the multiple sequence alignment in fig . shows the similarity of the _PROTEIN_ sequences from plants as well as between sequences from plants and humans . the _PROTEIN_ difference between _PROTEIN_ from dicotyledons and other plants is that the dicotyledons contain glycine residues in positions and using the numbers according to the a. thaliana _PROTEIN_ whereas only one glycine is present at this spot in _PROTEIN_ like proteins from bryophytes conifers and monocots . these residues are in a region that correspond to a turn between strands iii and iv in the mammalian protein . to understand more about the evolutionary relationships between _PROTEIN_ domains we searched the protein nucleotide and _PROTEIN_ sequence tag data bases for _PROTEIN_ domains from archaea eubacteria and eukaryota . the amino acid sequences of the _PROTEIN_ domains were aligned and a phylogenetic tree was constructed using the neighbor joining method . as expected plant _PROTEIN_ sequences form a specific cluster . within the plant cluster groups are formed by the sequences from dicotyledons monocotyledons and _METHOD_ . we can also note that the _PROTEIN_ domains from _PROTEIN_ x/scp dbp and unc form separate groups . probably within each of these groups the _PROTEIN_ domains have evolved from a common origin . the eukaryotic _PROTEIN_ domains encoded by separate unfused genes are not in a specific branch . rather it _METHOD_ that unfused _PROTEIN_ genes have been formed several times during the evolution of eukaryotic _METHOD_ . models of atscp in the apo and ligand bound models of atscp in apo and ligand bound _METHOD_ were constructed using as the templates the rabbit _PROTEIN_ structure and the _PROTEIN_ like domain of human dbp respectively . the sequence alignment was manually refined prior to model building at the position of atscp to align with of rabbit _PROTEIN_ and of the _PROTEIN_ like domain of human dbp because this valine _METHOD_ to be structurally important based on the structure based sequence alignment and visual inspection of the _PROTEIN_ structures . based on the sequence alignment used for modeling atscp shares and sequence identity with the rabbit and human _PROTEIN_ template sequences respectively and reliable models could thus be generated . the mosquito _PROTEIN_ sequence has significantly lower only sequence identity to atscp and therefore was used only for structural comparison . in general the two templates have a very similar fold and differ only at certain locations . the c terminal end is clearly different in the structures of rabbit _PROTEIN_ and the _PROTEIN_ like domain of human dbe . both in the _PROTEIN_ like domain of human dbp and mosquito _PROTEIN_ structures which presumably represent the ligand bound conformation the c terminal part is folded into a long helix whereas in the rabbit apo _PROTEIN_ the c terminal end of the helix has an irregular coil structure instead . it is currently unclear whether these two conformations truly represent the _PROTEIN_ conformation with and without ligand because the _PROTEIN_ structures in both of the conformations are not known from the same organism . the loop between strands i and ii of the central sheet is another structurally variable area . in addition the sequence identity between atscp and the templates is low at this loop and thus the models are less reliable at this loop . the structural models of atscp have a central five stranded sheet that is covered on one side by five helices . both of the models also have a large hydrophobic cavity that is similar to the one found in the template _PROTEIN_ structures . this ligand binding tunnel has an entrance between helices d and e and strand v and an exit that is composed of side chains from helices a c and e. the cavity is lined with hydrophobic residues _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in the atscp model in the same way as in the template structures . of these residues and are conserved in both of the template structures . in addition residues and _PROTEIN_ are conserved in the rabbit _PROTEIN_ structure and residues and are conserved in the _PROTEIN_ like domain of human dbp . the entrance of the cavity is lined by _PROTEIN_ residues and in both the apo atscp and the ligand bound atscp model . two of these residues and are conserved in the _PROTEIN_ like domain of human dbp whereas only is conserved in the rabbit _PROTEIN_ structure which has a methionine in the position corresponding to . in the _PROTEIN_ like domain of human dbp _METHOD_ a hydrogen bond with triton x . the residue corresponding to is a glutamine in both of the template structures . is located in the middle of helix e. at the end of helix e an additional residue points toward the cavity at the exit of the ligand binding tunnel in the ligand bound conformation of atscp . in the template structures there is an alanine in this position . in general the ligand binding cavity is smaller in the apo atscp model than in the structural model of the ligand bound conformation of atscp . this is _PROTEIN_ because of the different fold at the c terminal end of the models . lipid transfer capability of atscp searching the data bases we identified several full length cdna clones encoding a. thaliana _PROTEIN_ . we obtained one such clone from the arabidopsis biological resource center at the ohio state university . this cdna was derived from mrna isolated from light grown day old seedlings of arabidopsis . the atscp cdna was subcloned behind _PROTEIN_ in the prokaryotic _PROTEIN_ vector pgex yielding plasmid pgex _PROTEIN_ . this plasmid was transformed into e. coli and the _PROTEIN_ of a _PROTEIN_ atscp fusion protein was induced by the addition of isopropyl thio d galactopyranoside to the growth media . after lysis of the bacterial cells the fusion protein was adsorbed to glutathione sepharose . _PROTEIN_ xa was added to cleave the fusion protein at a site between the _PROTEIN_ tag and atscp . atscp was then eluted from the glutathione sepharose . when the eluted fraction was analyzed by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ electrophoresis a polypeptide with a molecular _METHOD_ of kda was detected . to verify that this polypeptide corresponded to atscp we cut the band from the gel and added trypsin to digest the protein into smaller peptides . the trypsin digest was analyzed with electrospray _METHOD_ spectroscopy in a _METHOD_ spectrometer equipped with quadrupole and time of flight _METHOD_ detectors . the obtained peptide _METHOD_ and peptide sequences matched the theoretical peptide _METHOD_ and sequences of atscp . the kda protein was also recognized in immunoblottings using an affinity purified peptide antisera against plant _PROTEIN_ . to examine the intermembrane lipid transfer capability of the recombinant atscp we used a fret approach developed previously for monitoring protein mediated glycolipid transfer between vesicle _LOCATION_ . we assayed the transfer activity using the following _METHOD_ lipids bodipy pc bodipy glccer nbd ceramide and av galcer . using the fret assay we show that the recombinant atscp is capable of transferring phosphatidylcholine whereas the enzyme is inactive on _PROTEIN_ and ceramide . in the lipid transfer assays glycolipid transfer protein was used as control for the assay integrity . to further examine the ability of atscp to mediate transfer of unlabeled lipids we used a competition assay . in this assay setup the bodipy pc and the added unlabeled lipids compete as substrates for atscp . we analyzed the ability of popc dmpa bovine brain ceramide cholesterol palmitic acid and stearoyl coenzyme a and a wide range of plant lipids . the transfer rate of bodipy pc after addition of liposomes was almost completely inhibited for popc and _LOCATION_ . dmpa stigmasterol and steryl _PROTEIN_ showed a ability to lower the bodipy pc transfer rate . the rest of the tested compound only showed a marginal competing effect and the single chain palmitic acid and stearoyl coenzyme a did not affect the transfer at all . we confirm that the addition of ceramide did not slow down the transfer rate of bodipy pc thereby validating the accuracy of the transfer assay because nbd ceramide was neither transferred as a labeled compound . cellular localization of atscp c terminus of atscp contains a _PROTEIN_ peroxisomal targeting sequence . a peroxisomal location has also been shown for the mammalian enzymes . to test whether the plant enzyme also is targeted to the _LOCATION_ we constructed gene fusions between the soluble modified red shifted green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ and atscp . in plasmid the fusion is constructed such that the fusion protein consists of atscp in the n terminus and smrs _METHOD_ in the c terminus _METHOD_ whereas the fusion protein encoded by the plasmid contains smrs _METHOD_ in the n terminus and atscp in the c terminus _METHOD_ . the plasmids and psmrs _METHOD_ which encodes smrs _METHOD_ without fusion partner were transformed by particle bombardment to onion cells . the transformed tissues were analyzed using _METHOD_ microscopy . when the onion epidermis cells were transformed with plasmids psmrs _METHOD_ and soluble _METHOD_ were detected in the _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ . in the encoded fusion atscp _METHOD_ the putative _PROTEIN_ from atscp is not exposed in the c terminus . however when onion cells were transformed with which encodes _METHOD_ atscp carrying the _PROTEIN_ in its original position in the c terminus _METHOD_ was obtained from distinct organelles . the size and the irregular shape of the _METHOD_ organelles the presence of a _PROTEIN_ signal and the need to have atscp _PROTEIN_ exposed in the c terminus of the fusion protein let us conclude that atscp localizes to the _LOCATION_ via the use of the _PROTEIN_ signal sequence . _PROTEIN_ pattern of atscp in a. rna was isolated from different tissues of mature a. thaliana plants such as inflorescence leaves _METHOD_ roots siliques and flower buds . we also isolated rna from and day old seedlings . the _PROTEIN_ pattern of atscp rna was analyzed by rt pcr using the gene specific primers _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . analysis of the pcr products revealed that a pcr product of the expected size of bp was obtained from all samples . thus our results suggest that atscp is _PROTEIN_ in most tissues of young and adult a. thaliana plants . as a control of our rna preparations and rt pcr conditions we also used primers and to analyze the _PROTEIN_ of ubiquitin conjugating enzyme kda which according to microarray analysis is one of the a. thaliana genes that shows the most stable _PROTEIN_ pattern . rt pcr with and yielded a pcr product of the expected size bp .
plant materials and bacterial used arabidopsis thaliana ecotype columbia . seeds were surface sterilized _PROTEIN_ and sown on murashige and skoog medium _METHOD_ . before cultivation seed dormancy was broken by to days of cold treatment . plants grown under nonsterile conditions were planted on soil mixed with vermiculite . the plants were cultivated under controlled environmental chambers at to under long day conditions . onions allium cepa l. used for detection of green _METHOD_ protein fusions were picked from a garden . escherichia coli strains and _PROTEIN_ were used for general cloning and blue/white screening . e. coli was used for heterologous _PROTEIN_ of atscp . examine the intermembrane lipid transfer capability of atscp we used the following _METHOD_ lipids bodipy phosphatidylcholine bodipy _PROTEIN_ and nbd ceramide . as the non transferable energy acceptor in these _METHOD_ resonance energy transfer assays we used dii . these lipids were all obtained from molecular probes . anthrylvinyl galactosylceramide was also examined as a potential substrate for transfer activity and as its nontransferable energy acceptor pair we used perylenoyl triolein . these lipids were synthesized as described previously . bovine brain ceramide and cholesterol were from sigma and palmitoyl oleoyl phosphatidylcholine dimyristoyl phosphatidic acid sitosterol desmosterol steryl _PROTEIN_ stigmasterol palmitic acid stearoyl coa and _LOCATION_ from larodan ab sweden . and amino acid sequence data bases were searched using blast . multiple sequence alignment was created using clustal x and the resulting similarities were then visualized by subjecting the alignment to peptide sequence data were analyzed using the biolynx program of the _METHOD_ nt software package _METHOD_ . atscp structural models of atscp were generated the structure of atscp without ligand was modeled using as template the rabbit _PROTEIN_ structure and the structure of atscp in the putative ligand bound form using as template the _PROTEIN_ like domain of human dbp . the rabbit _PROTEIN_ has no visible ligand whereas the human _PROTEIN_ like protein has a triton x molecule bound in its inner hydrophobic cavity mimicking the ligand binding . the third known _PROTEIN_ x ray structure _PROTEIN_ from yellow fever mosquito was used for structural comparison . the three _PROTEIN_ structures were superimposed using the program vertaa in the bodil modeling environment . the sequence alignment of the three structurally known _PROTEIN_ sequences and the atscp sequence was performed within bodil using the program malign . the alignment was then refined taking into consideration structural features derived from the structure based sequence alignment as well as conserved positions in the multiple sequence alignment of plant _PROTEIN_ . based on the final sequence alignment and using both of the template structures a set of different models was made for apo atscp and the ligand bound conformation of atscp using the program modeller . from each set of models the one with the lowest value of the modeller objective function was chosen for further analysis . the two final models were compared with each other and to the template structures by superimposing them on each other using the program vertaa within bodil . the models were also analyzed with the program surfnet to identify cavities within the structures . the cavities were visualized with bodil . _PROTEIN_ and purification of atscp in e. cdna clone carrying the atscp cdna inserted into vector was obtained from the arabidopsis biological resource center . the coding region was amplified from plasmid by the use of primers _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . the obtained pcr fragment was digested with restriction enzymes ecori and noti and subcloned into the ecori noti site of the vector pgex to obtain a gene fusion between gluthatione s transferase _PROTEIN_ and atscp . the atscp insert in the obtained plasmid pgex _PROTEIN_ was confirmed by dna sequencing . plasmid pgex _PROTEIN_ was transformed into e. coli cells . the cells were grown overnight in ml of lb containing ampicillin in . in the morning the cells were diluted times in ml of lb containing ampicillin . when reached _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ atscp was induced with the addition of mm isopropyl thio d galactopyranoside . cells were then grown for an additional h. for preparation of cell extracts and purification of _PROTEIN_ atscp we followed the procedures described in the handbook for the _PROTEIN_ gene fusion system . bacterial cells were pelleted by centrifugation and resuspended in ml of phosphate buffered saline . cells were lysed by sonication for s with a labsonic u sonicator . the lysate was centrifuged in for min at g. the supernatant was decanted and saved . for adsorbing the _PROTEIN_ atscp fusion protein of a slurry of glutathione sepharose was added to ml of the bacterial extract . the mixture was incubated for min in room temperature and then centrifuged at g for min to sediment the _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ was washed three times with phosphate buffered saline . to release atscp from the _PROTEIN_ tag of _PROTEIN_ xa and of _PROTEIN_ xa cleavage buffer were added to the glutathione sepharose pellet . the cleavage reaction was incubated for h at room temperature . the suspension was then centrifuged at g for min . the supernatant was removed to a fresh tube and saved . to increase the yield of the atscp protein the glutathione sepharose suspension was washed with of phosphate buffered saline . the protein concentration in the supernatants was indicating that the yield of the purified recombinant atscp was mg/liter of bacterial culture . glycerol was added to a final concentration of before placing the supernatants in . five of the purified protein fraction was analyzed by one dimensional gel electrophoresis on nupage bistris gels using an mes running buffer . the gels were stained with _METHOD_ brilliant blue and the protein band of interest was excised using a sharp knife cut into smaller parts and then washed in water . the protein was in gel digested with trypsin extracted and analyzed by _METHOD_ spectroscopy . for the _METHOD_ analysis we used an instrument equipped with quadrupole and time of flight _METHOD_ detectors _METHOD_ _METHOD_ with a nanospray ion source using the procedure described previously which is a slightly modified version of a method described by mann and co workers . fret assay for monitoring _PROTEIN_ mediated lipid intermembrane fret method used for measuring the transfer of lipids between two bilayer vesicle populations has been thoroughly described previously . briefly a fret assay utilizing a labeled lipid that served as the energy donor and a nontransferable lipid as the energy acceptor permitted continuous real time monitoring of atscp activity . small unilamellar bovine brain sphingomyelin/cholesterol mixed donor vesicles containing the _METHOD_ lipids were prepared by probe sonication . bovine brain sphingomyelin/cholesterol acceptor vesicles were also prepared by sonication . the acceptor vesicles were in fold excess . calculation of the transfer rate was achieved by fitting to first order exponential behavior as previously described in detail . as a positive transfer control we used a transfer protein specific for glycolipids . competition analyze different unlabeled lipids as potential substrates for atscp we used a competition assay . after the above described fret bodipy pc assay was started by addition of atscp and after a steady transfer rate was reached unlabeled lipids were added as liposomes to the reaction mixture . this would result in a _PROTEIN_ in the transfer rate of the _METHOD_ labeled phosphatidylcholine because of the presence of a new transferable lipid pool of atscp substrate . if the added lipid is not a substrate for atscp no deviation in the slope of the transfer rate would occur . similar types of approaches have been used previously . transformation and visualization of _METHOD_ vector psmrs _METHOD_ is a based plasmid carrying the promoter in front of a soluble modified red shifted _METHOD_ _METHOD_ followed by the _PROTEIN_ terminator . this vector was used for construction of plasmids and which both encode atscp _METHOD_ fusion proteins . plasmid carries a _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion with atscp in the n terminus and smrs _METHOD_ in the c terminus . this plasmid was constructed by amplifying atscp cdna using primers _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . the pcr product was cleaved with bamhi and ligated to the bamhi site of psmrs _METHOD_ . plasmid encodes a fusion protein with smrs _METHOD_ in the n terminus and atscp in the c terminus . this plasmid was constructed by amplifying atscp cdna using primers _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . the obtained pcr fragment contains an ecori site in the n terminal region of the atscp gene and a saci site in the c terminal region . furthermore smrs _METHOD_ was amplified using primers _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ an amplification that yielded a pcr fragment with a bamhi site in the n terminal part of the _METHOD_ gene and a ecori site in the part of the gene encoding the c terminus . the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ fragment was cleaved with restriction enzymes ecori saci whereas the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ amplified fragment was digested with bamhi ecori . the fragments were then ligated to psmrs _METHOD_ that had been cut with endonucleases bamhi and

containing _METHOD_ . the onion pieces were bombarded using a biolistic _PROTEIN_ biolistic particle delivery system with p.s.i . rupture discs under a vacuum of bar . after bombardment the onion pieces were left to recover on _METHOD_ plates for h in . the onion pieces were then stored in a cold room . onion skin epidermal layers were peeled from the onion pieces . the peels were placed on glass slides and examined with a zeiss axioskop mot _METHOD_ light microscope . the _METHOD_ signal was detected using a fluorescein isothiocyanate filter _METHOD_ . preparation of antibodies against _PROTEIN_ synthetic peptide _PROTEIN_ with the amino acid sequence _METHOD_ was designed based on the amino acid sequences of the plant _PROTEIN_ sequences . a sequence close to the c terminus was chosen for immunization because of its high conservation and its presumed exposed position . agrisera performed peptide synthesis coupling to bovine serum albumin immunization of a rabbit bleedings
