microtubules are crucial for both the establishment of cellular _PROTEIN_ and the progression of all mitotic phases leading to karyokinesis and cytokinesis . mt organization and spindle formation rely on the activity of tubulin and associated proteins throughout the cell cycle . to date the molecular _METHOD_ modulating tubulin complex location remain largely unknown . in this work two arabidopsis thaliana proteins interacting with gamma tubulin _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ interacting _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ have been characterized . both _PROTEIN_ genes are ubiquitously _PROTEIN_ in all tissues analyzed . immunolocalization studies combined with the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ green _METHOD_ protein fusions have shown that _PROTEIN_ colocalize with tubulin _PROTEIN_ and/or _PROTEIN_ and reorganize from the _LOCATION_ to the prospindle and the preprophase band in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . after _LOCATION_ envelope breakdown they localize on spindle and phragmoplast mts and on the reforming _LOCATION_ envelope of daughter cells . the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutants exhibit severe growth defects and sterility . at the cellular level they are characterized by mt misorganization and abnormal spindle _PROTEIN_ resulting in ploidy defects . altogether our data show that during mitosis _PROTEIN_ play a role in tubulin complex localization spindle stability and chromosomal segregation .
searches in the arabidopsis sequence databases revealed a _PROTEIN_ homologous gene which was named _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ encodes a amino acid protein with a predicted molecular _METHOD_ of kd . the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ proteins share amino acid sequence identity . _PROTEIN_ homologs are present and well conserved among various species . interestingly two members of the _PROTEIN_ family exist in the plant kingdom while only one is present in the animal kingdom . _PROTEIN_ are small proteins with a well conserved central region . the percentages of identity among the _PROTEIN_ homologs presented range from for caenorhabditis elegans to for rice _PROTEIN_ . the human homolog of _PROTEIN_ shares of identity with the arabidopsis protein . all these sequence analyses suggest that _PROTEIN_ proteins share important properties and functions that have been conserved throughout evolution . quantitative rt pcr analyses show that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are ubiquitously _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis . however _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is higher in young tissues and meristematic cells arguing in favor of a role in cycling cells . percentage of amino acid identity between arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ and some eukaryotic homologs arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ interacts with _PROTEIN_ both in a yeast two hybrid system and in vitro . to confirm whether _PROTEIN_ behaves similarly glutathione s transferase _PROTEIN_ pull down assays were performed . radiolabeled _PROTEIN_ such as _PROTEIN_ used here as a positive control was detected in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ fraction but not in the _PROTEIN_ fraction indicating that _PROTEIN_ has the propensity to interact with _PROTEIN_ . in parallel the interaction of _PROTEIN_ with either _PROTEIN_ tubulin _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was also tested . none of these fusion proteins interacted with _PROTEIN_ . to identify the _PROTEIN_ domain that could mediate the binding to _PROTEIN_ the interaction of the full length sequence and of five _PROTEIN_ truncated regions corresponding to aa aa aa and was investigated . the amino acid n terminal region of _PROTEIN_ retained the interaction with both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . to determine whether _PROTEIN_ were present in tubulin complexes arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ sesquimutants transformed by a _PROTEIN_ etag _METHOD_ _METHOD_ dna construct were used for coimmunoprecipitation experiments . this construct was able to rescue the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant validating its functionality . the _PROTEIN_ etag _METHOD_ fusion protein _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was immunodetected in total protein extracts by an anti _METHOD_ antibody . _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ immunopurified fractions were prepared and separately subjected to immunoblotting using anti _PROTEIN_ and anti tubulin antibodies . both endogenous _PROTEIN_ and tubulin could be detected in enriched _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fractions indicating that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and tubulin are part of the same protein complex in vivo . the _PROTEIN_ and localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was followed in the root apical meristem of week old arabidopsis seedlings transformed with either the _PROTEIN_ etag _METHOD_ or the _PROTEIN_ etag _METHOD_ dna construct . the _PROTEIN_ of the etag _METHOD_ fusion proteins was checked using confocal microscopy and through immunoblotting analyses using anti etag antibodies . it appeared that the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ did not affect the plant phenotype throughout development . mt immunolabeling and diamidino phenylindole staining were performed after fixation . a diffuse _METHOD_ background could be observed in the cytoplasm of all cells . in such conditions no significant _METHOD_ signal emerged from the _METHOD_ background in the cortex which makes these cells inappropriate to the study of cortical mt nucleating sites . however a significant signal was present within interphase _LOCATION_ . twenty percent of cells showed a bright nucleoplasm had a spotty pattern at the _LOCATION_ periphery and had a nucleoplasmic _METHOD_ not exceeding that of the cytoplasmic background . during mitosis _PROTEIN_ labeling colocalized with preprophase band _PROTEIN_ mts prospindles and _PROTEIN_ kinetochore mts in anaphase . when observed in vivo after _LOCATION_ envelope breakdown _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ dynamics could be followed . _PROTEIN_ localized within spindles during prometaphase to anaphase and they relocated on interpolar and phragmoplast mts from mid anaphase to telophase . during telophase _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ also decorated the newly formed ne of daughter cells . to study the localization of endogenous _PROTEIN_ a polyclonal rabbit antiserum was raised and tested positively against recombinant _PROTEIN_ migrating between the and kd positions of protein markers validating the specificity of the anti _PROTEIN_ antibody . _PROTEIN_ was detected when ectopically _PROTEIN_ as a _METHOD_ fusion protein . unexpectedly however immunoblot analyses using standard conditions could not reveal any endogenous _PROTEIN_ in protein extracts from either wild type or _PROTEIN_ etag _METHOD_ arabidopsis lines . in addition no significant signal corresponding to _PROTEIN_ immunolabeling could be observed in wild type seedling roots . _PROTEIN_ could only be detected in the analysis of proteins obtained with an improved extraction method which shows that _PROTEIN_ are present at very low amounts in arabidopsis tissues . considering the conservation of _PROTEIN_ in plants immunomicroscopy experiments were further performed on growing tobacco by cells . in the mitotic cells _PROTEIN_ showed the same localization pattern as for _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in arabidopsis . in addition several cortical dots were observed in interphase cells some of them coinciding with mt arrays . _PROTEIN_ localization studies indicate the presence of _PROTEIN_ in mt nucleation and organization sites especially at the onset and during mitosis . to determine whether _PROTEIN_ colocalize with tubulin complexes the distribution of _PROTEIN_ was compared with that of other gcps in wild type plants and plants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . anti _PROTEIN_ or anti tubulin antibodies were used as markers of the plant tusc . anti _PROTEIN_ antibodies were used as markers for the turc . the labeling was also compared with the microtubular pattern revealed by anti tubulin antibodies . during mitosis the three gcp proteins were _PROTEIN_ shown to be associated with kinetochore fibers in all dividing cells . this was particularly visible during anaphase with the triangular labeling of _PROTEIN_ mt fibers . when the antibodies were used on _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ cells the gcp labeling coincided with the _PROTEIN_ recombinant protein signal . this was confirmed by superimposed _METHOD_ intensity profiles compared with the chromatid staining . notably the _PROTEIN_ staining was less visible within the spindle in _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ cells than in wild type controls arguing in favor of a steric cluttering limiting the immunoreaction with the presence of _METHOD_ . such a difference was not observed using anti tubulin or anti _PROTEIN_ antibodies . altogether our data show that _PROTEIN_ colocalize with either _PROTEIN_ tubulin or _PROTEIN_ in spindle mts . these findings are consistent with the association of _PROTEIN_ with tuscs and/or turcs in arabidopsis . to gain insights into the function of plant _PROTEIN_ arabidopsis t dna insertion mutants were studied . the mutated _PROTEIN_ allele carries a t dna insertion in the untranslated region intron located upstream of the open reading frame and the _PROTEIN_ allele carries a t dna insertion in the utr associated with a downstream deletion of bp . these positions were both checked using pcr amplification and sequencing of the t dna flanking regions . homozygous _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ lines were crossed to produce the double mutants . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mrna levels were determined in the wild type _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ sesquimutants and double mutants . no significant wild type _PROTEIN_ mrna was detected in _PROTEIN_ mutants using specific primers located upstream and downstream from the t dna insertion . rt pcr using downstream primers indicates that the t dna insertion prevents a correct splicing of _PROTEIN_ transcripts suggesting a significant knockdown of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . for _PROTEIN_ due to the t dna insertion in the end of the utr _PROTEIN_ levels could only be checked using downstream pcr primers . in _PROTEIN_ mutants a chimeric transcript corresponding to the end of the t dna insertion in fusion with the first exon of _PROTEIN_ was detected . the accumulation of this aberrant transcript is probably due to the presence of the promoter in the t dna . however the production of functional _PROTEIN_ is unlikely according to the classic translation rules of eukaryotic mrnas . such a case has already been described for tubulin t dna insertion mutants . the presence of _PROTEIN_ in wild type and mutant lines was checked by immunoblotting of concentrated protein extracts . _PROTEIN_ were faintly detected in the extracts from wild type plants and similar low amounts of _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ were present in sesquimutants . however _PROTEIN_ were undetectable in extracts from double mutants according to our experimental conditions suggesting that t dna insertions impair _PROTEIN_ synthesis from both mutant alleles . the gip double mutants may therefore be considered as strong knockdown mutants . to check whether _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ played a role at specific tissue or developmental stages seedlings growing and mature plants corresponding to _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ homozygous single mutants and wild type lines were compared . single mutants and sesquimutants had a wild type like developmental phenotype and were fertile suggesting functional redundancy for _PROTEIN_ genes in standard growing conditions . the combination of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ homozygous alleles induced severe developmental defects . eighteen to of seeds were unable to germinate . for comparison only of ungerminated seeds were observed after control wild type autofertilization . ten days after germination a strong phenotype was revealed for to of seedlings suggesting that _PROTEIN_ loss induces gametophyte and/or embryo lethality . indeed the analysis of the sesquimutant siliques showed either ovules in which the development of the zygote was blocked at a globular stage certainly resulting in aborted seeds or embryos of a much smaller size than that of heterozygotes . all the phenotypically affected plantlets exhibited a _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ genotype . their development was strongly delayed and only one third of the seedlings developed until flowering indicating that _PROTEIN_ are required for plant development . double mutant seedlings had short primary roots that grew like corkscrews very short hypocotyl and abnormal cotyledons appearing as green callus like structures . rosette development showed narrow curved leaves before the formation of short bolts . to confirm that the observed phenotypes were linked to gip mutations dna sequences corresponding to kb _PROTEIN_ and kb _PROTEIN_ genomic fragments were reintroduced into sesquimutants . both wild type genomic constructs rescued the developmental phenotype in the double mutant background obtained after sesquimutant autofertilization . moreover the _PROTEIN_ etag _METHOD_ construct also restored a wild type like phenotype of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant . a specific _METHOD_ signal was observed using confocal microscopy in sporophytic tissues in gametophytes and in dissected developing embryos indicating that in the complemented arabidopsis mutant lines obtained _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was _PROTEIN_ throughout the different developmental stages . defects in meristem organization and _PROTEIN_ were observed in the shoot and the root apical _METHOD_ of double mutants . the cellular organization of the root apical meristem was carefully investigated . the pattern of the different cell types was disturbed and cells were often bulging irregular and bigger in size compared with the wild type or sesquimutants . collapsing meristematic elongating and differentiating root zones were observed in differential interference contrast and after propidium iodide cell wall labeling . in double mutants starch granules stained with lugol were reduced and _PROTEIN_ mislocated in a few remnant columella cells . the stem cell niche was disorganized and it was often difficult to identify the quiescent center . root tip cells of double mutants showed _LOCATION_ that were three times as large as those of sesquimutants in which one wild type _PROTEIN_ allele was present suggesting either an increase in dna content or enhanced chromatin decondensation . these _LOCATION_ were distorted in shape losing their circularity but _PROTEIN_ a dapi _METHOD_ intensity similar to that of control _LOCATION_ . altogether these data suggest that _PROTEIN_ may be linked to the regulation of cellular _PROTEIN_ and patterning as well as to the determination of _LOCATION_ morphology . to better understand the causes of tissue patterning defects mitosis was further investigated in double mutants by combining two approaches . first mts and chromatin of fixed cells were stained . then to correlate these results with _PROTEIN_ functions during cell division mts were visualized through the mt binding domain of fused to _METHOD_ and chromatin was highlighted through the _PROTEIN_ of a _METHOD_ histone variant . thus a mbd _METHOD_ or a _METHOD_ _METHOD_ construct was introgressed in the mutated _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ background . this helped to follow mt array dynamics or chromatin segregation in meristematic root cells . in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ seedlings the mitotic index was half of that observed in the wild type indicating that cell division progression was affected in gip double mutants . this was in accordance with the simultaneously observed smaller root length . cytoskeletal and chromosomal abnormalities were found in of the cells analyzed in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ root _METHOD_ . at the microtubular level of division figures corresponded to cells in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were in prometaphase and metaphase in anaphase and in telophase . in wild type roots of cells were in _PROTEIN_ in prometaphase and metaphase in anaphase and in telophase . these results indicated an anaphase delay during mitosis in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutants . at mitotic onset the _PROTEIN_ formed . however the positioning of _PROTEIN_ was altered and either oblique asymmetric or double _PROTEIN_ were observed . after neb defects in spindle _PROTEIN_ spindle mt organization and/or spindle size occurred . for the of cells that formed a _PROTEIN_ spindles were either misoriented or did not form . large polygonal cells which were able to form oblique spindles and divide could lead to daughter cells losing the straight cellular organization in root files like that shown in figure . unstable metaphase plates were observed but as spindle orientation defects could be spontaneously rescued the amount of mitotic defects could possibly be underestimated . in case of _PROTEIN_ narrowing and further decondensation without spindle formation the cellular dna content doubled leading to polyploid cells . at the level of chromosomes metaphase plates and anaphase segregation showed a large increase in the number of chromosomes with the presence of lagging chromosomes in anaphase and the appearance of micronuclei in interphase when compared with control wild type cells . after neb chromosome congression was observed but condensed chromosomes remained blocked in metaphase in of cells . for the remaining of mitotic cells anaphase was strongly delayed and chromatid segregation could lead to aneuploidy linked to chromosome lagging . all these observations suggested an increase in the ploidy level relative to wild type cells . to determine ploidy at the dna level _LOCATION_ dna contents were compared using flow cytometry . in all tissues analyzed the _LOCATION_ of the wild type or sesquimutant plants showed a majority of and _LOCATION_ corresponding to diploid cells . a complete loss of diploid cells and a shift up to dna content was detected in double mutants confirming the presence of polyploid cells . this indicates that three replication cycles without division and/or defects in dna segregation can occur in double mutants . altogether our data suggest a defect in the _METHOD_ of spindle orientation which could argue in favor of a role of _PROTEIN_ in kinetochore fiber formation or stability and in spindle _PROTEIN_ and/or integrity . in addition anaphase delay and _PROTEIN_ decondensation reveal the activation of the mitotic checkpoint but lagging chromosomes or misequilibrated anaphases suggest that plant cells can partially overcome chromosome abnormalities . the high number of polyploid and aneuploid cells in the very young root tip also suggests that early in embryogenesis the root stem cells were likely impeded in their normal division . during seed germination a new genetic program may then overcome the higher dna amount and restart cell division . _PROTEIN_ localization was highly similar to either tubulin _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ distribution suggesting a molecular interaction among _PROTEIN_ and turcs . to test this hypothesis the amount of tubulin _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ present at ne spindles and phragmoplasts was compared between wild type and gip double mutant cells . a significant _PROTEIN_ in tubulin _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ labeling was observed in mutant cells . a simultaneous reduction in the tubulin _METHOD_ intensity at the _LOCATION_ periphery and within spindles and phragmoplasts was observed in mutants compared with wild type cells indicating that _PROTEIN_ depletion affects the density of perinuclear and mitotic mt arrays . these results show that _PROTEIN_ play a role in the proper localization of tusc or turc components and in mt array organization .
