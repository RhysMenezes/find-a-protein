vesicle trafficking is essential for the generation of asymmetries which are central to multicellular development . core components of the vesicle transport machinery such as adp ribosylation _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ have been studied primarily at the single cell level . here we analyze developmental functions of the _PROTEIN_ subclass of the arabidopsis thaliana multigene arf family . six virtually identical _PROTEIN_ genes are ubiquitously _PROTEIN_ and single loss of function mutants in these genes reveal no obvious developmental phenotypes . _METHOD_ colocalization studies reveal that _PROTEIN_ is localized to the _LOCATION_ apparatus and endocytic organelles in both onion and arabidopsis cells . apical basal _PROTEIN_ of epidermal cells reflected by the position of root hair outgrowth is affected when _PROTEIN_ mutants are _PROTEIN_ at early stages of cell differentiation but after they exit mitosis . genetic interactions during root hair tip growth and localization suggest that the _PROTEIN_ protein is a target of _PROTEIN_ action but its localization is slowly affected upon _PROTEIN_ manipulation when compared with that of _LOCATION_ and endocytic markers . localization of a second potential target of _PROTEIN_ action _PROTEIN_ is also affected with slow kinetics . although extreme redundancy precludes conventional genetic dissection of _PROTEIN_ functions our approach separates different _PROTEIN_ downstream networks involved in local and specific aspects of cell _PROTEIN_ .
in arabidopsis six class arf proteins have been identified by the genome sequencing project . they share to amino acid identity with one another and conserved splice site positions . four of them can be grouped into two pairs derived from segmental genome duplication events . t dna insertion lines from the signal and the syngenta garlic collections revealed no obvious phenotypes indicating extensive functional redundancy . multiple rna interference lines targeted to a common class arf sequence also revealed no specific phenotypes . if class arf proteins perform overlapping functions in arabidopsis development they should also share _PROTEIN_ domains . we therefore created promoter fusions for all six class arf proteins using the _LOCATION_ localized yellow _METHOD_ protein _LOCATION_ as a reporter . for each promoter fusion independent transgenic lines were analyzed by confocal laser scanning microscopy _PROTEIN_ . _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ was observed in all the promoter fusion lines except for _PROTEIN_ which is preferentially _PROTEIN_ in anthers and pollen . the promoter fusion lines for the other five class arf proteins showed essentially the same _PROTEIN_ pattern with constitutive _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ in young seedlings indicating extensive overlap of class arf gene _PROTEIN_ . we focused our studies on the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ because this member has been studied at the cellular level . genbank est _PROTEIN_ data confirm that _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ in all organs examined . to investigate tissue specificity of _PROTEIN_ mrna _PROTEIN_ in different organs and at different developmental stages we created _PROTEIN_ promoter fusions using _PROTEIN_ as a reporter . gus activity was detected throughout the roots of all the transgenic lines examined . in addition we also observed strong gus activity in vascular bundles leaf primordia stomata trichomes style stigmatic tissue and young pollen . intense gus activity was detected in embryo sacs and dissected embryos of all stages . we investigated whether posttranscriptional regulation affected _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ by making stable transgenic arabidopsis plants carrying the fusion construct of wild type _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and enhanced green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ under control of the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ promoter _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . constitutive _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was found in all the _PROTEIN_ wt _METHOD_ translational fusion lines . for example _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was observed in all cells within the root meristem and _METHOD_ _METHOD_ localized to the region of forming cell plate to the growing root hairs and also was detected in stomata and trichome cells . collectively our data suggest that the _PROTEIN_ protein is ubiquitously _PROTEIN_ and overlaps with the _PROTEIN_ domain of the class arf members . in both yeast and mammalian cells _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ has significantly reduced _PROTEIN_ activity and therefore behaves as a constitutively activated mutant that can not hydrolyze its _PROTEIN_ and interferes with the sorting of _LOCATION_ proteins into _LOCATION_ derived _PROTEIN_ vesicles . arf has low affinity for _PROTEIN_ and has been shown to behave as a dominant negative mutant that blocks the formation of _PROTEIN_ coated vesicles . as the critical amino acids are conserved among class arf proteins both mutants are expected to also impair _PROTEIN_ mediated vesicle transport in plants . we made protein fusion constructs of _PROTEIN_ wt and the _PROTEIN_ and gdp locked dominant mutants of _PROTEIN_ namely _PROTEIN_ and arf with _METHOD_ enhanced cyan _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ or enhanced yellow _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ under control of a promoter of cauliflower mosaic virus . we studied the intracellular localization and dynamics of the translocation of _PROTEIN_ protein during transient _PROTEIN_ in onion epidermal cells . _PROTEIN_ locked _PROTEIN_ colocalized with wild type _PROTEIN_ in multiple punctuate structures whereas no _METHOD_ motile organelles were observed in cells with gdp locked _PROTEIN_ construct . colocalization studies using _PROTEIN_ wt _METHOD_ and a resident _LOCATION_ protein n sialyltransferase _PROTEIN_ fused to _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or a _LOCATION_ targeted n acetylglucosaminyl transferase fused to _METHOD_ _METHOD_ suggest that _PROTEIN_ largely resides in or associates with the _LOCATION_ apparatus but also localizes to organelles negative for the _LOCATION_ markers . the _LOCATION_ localization of _PROTEIN_ is in agreement with observations on maize and tobacco cells using _PROTEIN_ antisera . however our data indicate that _PROTEIN_ localizes to additional sites . indeed we found that _PROTEIN_ wt _METHOD_ _METHOD_ partially overlaps with the endocytic marker which does not label _LOCATION_ apparatus in both onion and arabidopsis cells suggesting that arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ is also localized to endocytic organelles . furthermore a subpopulation of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ coincides with a red _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ fusion to the conventional type _PROTEIN_ homolog _PROTEIN_ from arabidopsis _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ but not with a plant unique _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ fused to _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ indicating that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ reside in different endocytic organelles from _PROTEIN_ . in addition we found that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ moves along actin filaments illustrated by an _METHOD_ fusion to the mouse f actin binding protein talin _METHOD_ . we next studied the intracellular localization of wild type _PROTEIN_ and its mutated _METHOD_ in transgenic arabidopsis plants . a heat shock inducible promoter from the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ gene was used to drive _PROTEIN_ of the fusion proteins . intense _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was induced in arabidopsis root cells within h after heat shock induction . both heat shock induced _PROTEIN_ wt _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ distribute similar to _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ wt _METHOD_ suggesting that the heat shock promoter activity levels used did not alter protein localization . in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ lines _METHOD_ _METHOD_ is largely _LOCATION_ and localizes to the _LOCATION_ whereas no moving organelles were labeled . colocalization analysis of _PROTEIN_ wt _METHOD_ with _LOCATION_ and endocytic markers in arabidopsis _METHOD_ our observations in onion epidermal cells and in addition _PROTEIN_ wt _METHOD_ coaggregates with in bfa induced compartments . taken together our data suggest that _PROTEIN_ resides both in _LOCATION_ stacks and in a subpopulation of vesicles that move along actin filaments . the arabidopsis root allows dissection of different aspects of cell _PROTEIN_ in plants . distally meristematic root cells divide in oriented planes . in the more proximal cell elongation and cell differentiation zones trichoblast cells will develop root hairs at their basal end reflecting epidermal _PROTEIN_ along the apical basal axis . furthermore root hairs elongate by _PROTEIN_ tip growth . bfa treatment interferes with both aspects of epidermal _PROTEIN_ in a concentration dependent manner indicating that arf dependent processes are involved in apical basal _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ tip growth . in a search for specific _PROTEIN_ effects we focused on _PROTEIN_ aspects of a single cell type the trichoblast . to dissect _PROTEIN_ functions the /uas binary _PROTEIN_ system was used for region specific _PROTEIN_ of wild type _PROTEIN_ and its mutated _METHOD_ . manipulation of _PROTEIN_ function in the root meristem using the root meristem specific driver affected root development directional cell expansion and cytokinesis consistent with the expected household role of _PROTEIN_ in vesicle trafficking . however it did not cause any obvious defects in root hair initiation and root hair tip growth . we therefore specifically interfered with _PROTEIN_ function in trichoblasts . _PROTEIN_ wt and _PROTEIN_ mutants were _PROTEIN_ using a trichoblast specific driver _PROTEIN_ whose _PROTEIN_ is initiated at the onset of root hair outgrowth . no alteration in apical basal epidermal _PROTEIN_ or tip growth occurred in _PROTEIN_ wt overexpressing lines but trichoblast specific _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ significantly inhibited tip growth . root hair formation can be completely abolished after strong heat shock induction in transgenic lines carrying _PROTEIN_ and uas _PROTEIN_ or uas _PROTEIN_ whereas root hairs are normal in wild type plants or _PROTEIN_ wt overexpressing lines under the same conditions . unlike in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ lines proper root hair formation recovers abruptly in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ lines within d demonstrating that the effects of _PROTEIN_ locked _PROTEIN_ on root hair formation are reversible . root hairs are able to develop in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ lines after mild heat shock induction but _PROTEIN_ root hair tip growth is significantly inhibited . these data suggest a dose dependent effect of _PROTEIN_ manipulation on tip growth in arabidopsis root hairs . consistent with the effect of bfa treatment apical basal _PROTEIN_ in root hair initiation is dramatically affected by heat shock induced _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ but not _PROTEIN_ . the difference in effect of the _PROTEIN_ and gdp locked mutants of _PROTEIN_ on epidermal _PROTEIN_ might indicate that they act on different targets but can also reflect differences in protein level or stability . apical basal trichoblast _PROTEIN_ was not affected by the _PROTEIN_ mutants _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ domain as well as in the root cap region . we concluded that root hair positioning in response to epidermal _PROTEIN_ and the decision to grow out a hair per se occur in the elongation zone . the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ gene has been implicated as a regulator of both apical basal _PROTEIN_ in root hair initiation and _PROTEIN_ root hair tip growth . the _PROTEIN_ gene is _PROTEIN_ throughout root hair development and _PROTEIN_ overexpression results in longer root hairs with multiple tips whereas constitutively active _PROTEIN_ bound _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ inhibits and depolarizes root hair tip growth . transgenic lines carrying _PROTEIN_ and uas _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ display the bulged root hair phenotype reported for _PROTEIN_ lines whereas no root hair phenotype was observed in transgenic lines carrying and uas _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . bfa inhibits early _PROTEIN_ localization of rop proteins at the root hair initiation site suggesting that root hair initiation requires an early acting arf dependent process . to determine whether _PROTEIN_ function is involved in _PROTEIN_ action we studied genetic interactions between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in trichoblast cells . we crossed uas _PROTEIN_ or uas _PROTEIN_ into the transgenic lines carrying _PROTEIN_ and uas _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and performed epistasis analysis in the progeny . in all the lines examined root hairs showed tip growth defects but displayed no bulging indicating that _PROTEIN_ function in controlling _PROTEIN_ tip growth is _PROTEIN_ dependent . we next investigated the localization of the _PROTEIN_ protein in arabidopsis plants carrying the fusion construct of _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ under the control of the _PROTEIN_ promoter . _METHOD_ _METHOD_ is highly enriched in the apical and basal _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ of the root meristematic cells and consistent with its role in cell _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ localized to the future site of root hair formation as well as to the tips of growing root hairs . moreover _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ partially colocalized with endocytic marker upon bfa treatment implying arf dependent _PROTEIN_ trafficking . heat shock induced overexpression of wild type _PROTEIN_ had no obvious effects on the localization of the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion protein . however in _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ lines localization of the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion protein was significantly altered within h after heat shock induction illustrated by strong internalization and reduced _METHOD_ _METHOD_ on the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ function is required for _PROTEIN_ localization . delocalization of _PROTEIN_ after _PROTEIN_ manipulation was not clearly observed until h after heat shock which posed the question whether dominant _PROTEIN_ mutants act slowly on all _PROTEIN_ dependent processes or whether _PROTEIN_ localization defects might require intermediate steps . to assess whether heat shock induced _PROTEIN_ mutants can rapidly affect known vesicular trafficking pathways in the intact plant we analyzed changes in the distribution of _LOCATION_ markers a functional auxin efflux component _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion and the endocytic marker . as a control we timed the delocalization response of these markers to arf gef inhibition by bfa treatment . no changes were observed in the distribution of any marker after the overexpression of arf wt at all heat shock periods used . however within h of heat shock at _METHOD_ of the two _LOCATION_ markers n _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and nag _METHOD_ was significantly altered in both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ lines . surprisingly _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was visibly internalized only after prolonged heat shock suggesting that _PROTEIN_ exocytosis responds slowly to _PROTEIN_ manipulation . we found almost no internalization of after h of induction of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and almost no _LOCATION_ were labeled by within h of heat shock at when was added before heat shock induction . thus uptake of at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and endocytic trafficking of from endocytic organelles to the _LOCATION_ are affected consistent with the inhibition of endocytosis by _PROTEIN_ locked human _PROTEIN_ . bfa treatment affects the localization of _LOCATION_ markers within min to h consistent with the rapid changes observed upon _PROTEIN_ modulation . however _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ a slow responder to _PROTEIN_ modulation responds rapidly to bfa . more strikingly the response to bfa of the endocytic marker differs from its response to _PROTEIN_ manipulation because bfa strongly interferes with endocytic trafficking of from endocytic organelles to the _LOCATION_ but not with uptake . this might suggest that _PROTEIN_ modulates uptake through interaction with a bfa insensitive arf gef .
arabidopsis thaliana seeds were sterilized with the vapor phase sterilization protocol described at http and imbibed for d at in the dark then germinated on vertically oriented plates containing half strength _METHOD_ agar and sucrose ph and grown in a plant room at with a h h dark cycle . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ cdna were amplified from an arabidopsis cdna library using pcr and cdna sequences were verified . and mutations in _PROTEIN_ and the _PROTEIN_ mutation in _PROTEIN_ were introduced using a pcr based site mutagenesis strategy . for the _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ and _PROTEIN_ gus promoter fusion constructs kb of upstream sequence from the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ gene was fused to an _LOCATION_ or gus reporter gene and nopaline synthase terminator engineered in pgreenii . to make the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ wt _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ wt _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ wt _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ constructs _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was fused in frame to the c terminus of _PROTEIN_ wild type or mutant proteins . the resulting fusions were cloned into the pgreenii vector under the control of the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ promoter camv promoter or arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ promoter respectively . nag _METHOD_ and nag _METHOD_ were generated from nag _METHOD_ by exchanging of _METHOD_ to _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ . for _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ nag cdna was exchanged for _PROTEIN_ cdna . to create _METHOD_ talin the mouse talin f actin binding sequence from was fused in frame to the c terminus of _METHOD_ engineered in pgreenii between the camv promoter and nopaline synthase terminator . to create the construct kb of upstream sequence from the arabidopsis gene was fused to the gv coding sequence the resulting construct also contained a uas _LOCATION_ or uas gus reporter engineered in the pgreenii vector . for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ constructs kb of arabidopsis the _PROTEIN_ gene promoter region or the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ promoter sequence was subcloned before the gv coding sequence in the pgreenii vector with a uas gus reporter . to generate uas _PROTEIN_ wt uas _PROTEIN_ uas _PROTEIN_ and uas _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plant transformation constructs _PROTEIN_ cdna _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were subcloned into a uas cassette engineered in pgreenii and these constructs were transformed directly into the gv lines . for the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ protein fusion the _METHOD_ coding sequence was fused in frame to n terminus of the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ gene in pgreenii vector between kb of the _PROTEIN_ promoter sequence and bp of the _PROTEIN_ untranslated region . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was generated by insertion of _METHOD_ into _PROTEIN_ genomic fragment _PROTEIN_ at position . its functionality was verified by the complementation of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ agravitropic phenotype . all the constructs were introduced into agrobacterium tumefaciens strain with the psoup plasmid by electroporation . plant transformation was done in arabidopsis columbia ecotype using the floral dip method . embryos and small seedlings were immersed in the staining solution _PROTEIN_ and incubated in the dark at . after staining all the samples were cleared in chloral hydrate distilled water glycerol and visualized using nomarski optics on a zeiss axioskop microscope with a nikon digital camera . for particle bombardment all plasmids were amplified in escherichia coli strain and purified using plasmid midi or mini kits according to the manufacturer 's instructions . onion bulb scale epidermis was bombarded with gold particles coated with plasmids using a bio rad _PROTEIN_ particle delivery system . bombarded specimens were incubated in water before _PROTEIN_ analysis . bfa treatments were performed as described previously . for stainings onion epidermis or arabidopsis seedlings were incubated in ml of distilled water containing for indicated periods at room temperature . stained samples were washed twice with water and underwent heat shock treatment or were directly observed by _PROTEIN_ and/or two photon lsm . _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ seedlings were visualized using a leica mz fliii _METHOD_ stereomicroscope equipped with _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ filters . propidium iodide was used to stain the cell walls of living root cells . two photon lsm and _PROTEIN_ were used as described .
