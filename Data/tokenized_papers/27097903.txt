ethylene as a gaseous plant hormone is directly involved in various processes during plant growth and development . much is known _PROTEIN_ the ethylene receptors and regulatory _PROTEIN_ in the ethylene signal transduction pathway . in arabidopsis thaliana _PROTEIN_ to ethylene _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ can interact with and positively regulates the ethylene receptor ethylene _PROTEIN_ . in this study we report the identification and characterization of an _PROTEIN_ interacting protein a putative arabidopsis lipid transfer protein _PROTEIN_ of unknown function . through bimolecular _METHOD_ complementation a direct molecular interaction between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ was verified in planta . analysis of an _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion in transgenic plants and plasmolysis experiments revealed that _PROTEIN_ is localized to the cytoplasm . analysis of ethylene responses showed that the _PROTEIN_ knockout is hypersensitive to aminocyclopropanecarboxylic acid while _PROTEIN_ overexpression confers insensitivity . analysis of double mutants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ demonstrates a regulatory function of _PROTEIN_ in ethylene receptor signaling through the molecular association with _PROTEIN_ . this study uncovers a novel function of arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ in the regulation of ethylene response and signaling .
arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ can specifically regulate _PROTEIN_ mediated ethylene signaling through physical interaction with _PROTEIN_ receptor . in order to identify _PROTEIN_ interacting proteins we carried out a yeast two hybrid screen of an arabidopsis cdna library using the full length _PROTEIN_ coding sequence as bait . the screen was based on reconstitution of ubiquitin protein halves in a split ubiquitin system . the _PROTEIN_ bait fusion was localized primarily to the yeast _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ with the c terminus localized in the yeast cytoplasm . as described previously several positives were isolated from a total of colonies screened and one clone encoded the c terminus of cytochrome isoform d . one of the other positive clones encoded the full length arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ protein . the interaction of _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ was retested in the split ubiquitin assay and positive reactions are shown in fig . . as a control _PROTEIN_ also interacts with _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ homolog in arabidopsis . in contrast no interaction was detected between _PROTEIN_ and the _PROTEIN_ receptor . in addition we examined the interaction between full length _PROTEIN_ and different portions of _PROTEIN_ and the experiments indicate that the c terminus of _PROTEIN_ is required for the protein interaction while the _PROTEIN_ n terminus is not essential for the interaction . to further verify the molecular interaction between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ we used the bimolecular _METHOD_ complementation assay . the coding sequences of the _METHOD_ halves _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ were fused in frame to the full length coding sequences of the _PROTEIN_ n terminus and the _PROTEIN_ c terminus respectively . under a laser scanning confocal microscope a _METHOD_ signal from the reconstitution of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was observed . in the absence of either _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ no _METHOD_ was observed . the interaction between _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusions were also examined by the bifc assay but no signal was detected consistent with that observed in the yeast split ubiquitin assay . we next examined if the _PROTEIN_ of arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ is induced by ethylene . total mrna from seedlings treated with or without the ethylene precursor acc was used for the analysis of _PROTEIN_ transcript levels . analysis by semi quantitative and quantitative rt pcr showed that arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ is slightly induced by acc treatment . we also analyzed the tissue specific _PROTEIN_ of arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ in the _PROTEIN_ enhancer trap line with gus reporter in its promoter _PROTEIN_ . in the early stages of seed germination and seedling growth the reporter gus signal was not detected . after days of seedling growth strong _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ detected in the roots . in the mature plants the gus signal was detected in the leaf petiole veins and the young flower carpels . acc treatment did not detectably enhance gus staining in the seedlings . lipid transfer proteins are assumed to be involved in _LOCATION_ biogenesis by mediating the transport of lipids from their sites of biosynthesis typically the _LOCATION_ to other _LOCATION_ . transgenic arabidopsis plants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were obtained and used for protein localization of _PROTEIN_ in planta . various tissues from day old seedlings of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgenic plants were examined under a laser scanning confocal microscope . figure shows the representative images of _METHOD_ proteins distributed in the cytoplasm of root tissues . when the transgenic plants were treated with sucrose solution the green _METHOD_ signal was detected in the condensed cytoplasm because of the high osmotic environment . this observation indicates that arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ might not be an _LOCATION_ secreted protein . to examine the regulatory function of arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ in ethylene response and signaling the _PROTEIN_ loss of function mutant _PROTEIN_ was obtained from cold spring harbor laboratory and _PROTEIN_ overexpression transgenic arabidopsis plants were generated in this study . we examined _PROTEIN_ transcript levels in the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ overexpressing lines . no transcript of _PROTEIN_ was detected in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . in contrast high levels of _PROTEIN_ transcripts were detected in _PROTEIN_ overexpressing lines compared to the wild type . ethylene responses of the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ overexpression lines were analyzed at the seedling stage after germination in the dark on medium containing acc at different concentrations . figure shows the triple response phenotype of day old dark grown _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ overexpressing seedlings using wild type as controls . interestingly the hypocotyl lengths of _PROTEIN_ were shorter than those of wild type seedlings especially at high concentrations of acc suggesting that the _PROTEIN_ mutant displays enhanced ethylene sensitivity . in contrast _PROTEIN_ overexpression enhanced the hypocotyl lengths at low concentrations of acc especially at suggesting that overexpression of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ ethylene sensitivity . we additionally examined the _PROTEIN_ of ethylene response _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ genes which are downstream components in the ethylene signaling pathway . three _LOCATION_ genes _PROTEIN_ were chosen for quantitative rt pcr analysis in the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ overexpression lines . in the _PROTEIN_ mutant the relative _PROTEIN_ patterns of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are quite similar . when treated with acc at the relative _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were significantly higher than the wild type while _PROTEIN_ s _PROTEIN_ was less changed in the _PROTEIN_ . in contrast all the examined _LOCATION_ genes _PROTEIN_ showed _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ levels compared to the wild type in _PROTEIN_ overexpression lines when treated with acc at a low concentration . the higher concentration of acc induced higher _PROTEIN_ levels of the _LOCATION_ . the altered ethylene responses in the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ overexpressing plants and the molecular association of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ proteins prompted us to examine the genetic interaction between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . we genetically crossed _PROTEIN_ to the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants . the _PROTEIN_ mutant is a gain of function mutation that confers ethylene insensitivity . the progeny from the crosses were obtained and the double mutants of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were identified based on kanamycin resistance of the _PROTEIN_ and caps/dcaps markers for the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutations . as a wild type control a hybrid between ler and col was created since the _PROTEIN_ was in the ler background while the mutant _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are in the col ecotype . seedling phenotype analysis showed that the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ phenotype closely resembles that of _PROTEIN_ being hypersensitive to ethylene when treated with acc . measurement of hypocotyl lengths revealed that an increase of acc concentration up to or caused the hypocotyls from both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ to become much shorter than those of _PROTEIN_ or wt . in contrast the phenotype of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ etiolated seedlings appeared ethylene insensitive compared to wt or _PROTEIN_ mutant . the observation of _PROTEIN_ hypocotyl length in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ compared to _PROTEIN_ under different concentrations of acc suggests that _PROTEIN_ mutation might partially restore the ethylene sensitivity of _PROTEIN_ . lowered chlorophyll levels are known to reflect the ethylene sensitivity of plants . the total chlorophyll content in wt _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was measured and compared . as expected the total chlorophyll content in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plants was close to that in the _PROTEIN_ mutant while the levels of total chlorophyll in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were slightly changed compared to that in _PROTEIN_ . finally using quantitative rt pcr analysis the relative _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were examined in the plants . in the absence of acc the gene _PROTEIN_ levels of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in mutant _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were higher than those in wt suggesting that both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ have a negative effect on downstream _LOCATION_ gene _PROTEIN_ . it is interesting that this effect does not apply to _PROTEIN_ . in addition it was found that application of acc _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ but not in _PROTEIN_ indicating that knockout of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ the ethylene induced gene _PROTEIN_ of the _LOCATION_ genes and that _PROTEIN_ depends on _PROTEIN_ in downstream gene _PROTEIN_ . although the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ is slightly different from that of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ with low levels in the absence of acc but increased levels when acc was applied in the plants the transcript level of _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was close to that in the _PROTEIN_ mutant .

ubiquitin assay was as previously described . to construct fusions of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ the coding sequences of _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ were each pcr amplified from existing

_METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . as n terminus of arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ might contain a transmembrane domain the _METHOD_ was cloned at the c terminus of _PROTEIN_ in via restriction sites _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ .
