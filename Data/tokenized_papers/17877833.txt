the cyclic nucleotide gated ion channels _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ cation homeostasis essential for a wide range of physiological processes in plant cells . however the precise subcellular locations and trafficking of these _LOCATION_ proteins are poorly understood . this is further complicated by a general deficiency of information about targeting pathways of _LOCATION_ proteins in plants . to investigate _PROTEIN_ trafficking and localization we have measured _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in roots and leaves analyzed _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusions transiently _PROTEIN_ in protoplasts and conducted _METHOD_ labeling of protoplasts and immunoelectron microscopic analysis of high pressure frozen leaves and roots . _PROTEIN_ mrna and protein levels were fold higher in roots than leaves while _PROTEIN_ mrna and protein levels were nearly equal in these tissues . the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion was targeted to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ in leaf protoplasts and lightly labeled several intracellular structures . _METHOD_ microscopy with affinity purified _PROTEIN_ specific antisera indicated that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are present in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ of protoplasts . immunoelectron microscopy demonstrated that _PROTEIN_ was associated with the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ of mesophyll palisade parenchyma and epidermal cells of leaves and the meristem columella and cap cells of roots . was also observed in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ cisternae and vesicles of nm in size . patch clamp assays of an _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion _PROTEIN_ in cells measured significant cation currents . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ proteins . we postulate that _PROTEIN_ traffics from the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ via the _LOCATION_ apparatus and associated vesicles to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . the presence of the cation channel _PROTEIN_ in root cap meristem cells cell plate and gravity sensing columella cells combined with the previously reported antisense phenotypes of _PROTEIN_ gravitropic and cell enlargement responses suggest roles of _PROTEIN_ in modulating cation balance required for root gravitropism cell division and growth .
to study the location of _PROTEIN_ within the cellular _LOCATION_ of arabidopsis we chose a combination of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ targeting and immunological approaches . affinity purified _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ specific polyclonal antisera were generated against synthetic peptides derived from the unique sequences of less conserved sub regions within the _PROTEIN_ family . the corresponding positions of these peptides within the predicted two dimensional structure of a representative generic _PROTEIN_ are shown . the _PROTEIN_ specific antiserum binds to the hydrophilic n terminus just upstream from the first transmembrane domain while the _PROTEIN_ antiserum binds to an exposed outer loop between the fifth transmembrane domain and the pore . the specificity of the _PROTEIN_ specific antiserum has been characterized in detail against recombinant _PROTEIN_ and native plant proteins on immunoblots _PROTEIN_ . the specificity of the _PROTEIN_ antiserum was determined here . the _PROTEIN_ levels of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were assessed in mature leaves and roots using both real time rt pcr and immunoprecipitation of total cellular proteins . the abundance of _PROTEIN_ mrna was similar in roots and leaves whereas _PROTEIN_ mrna levels were over fold greater in roots . in addition _PROTEIN_ mrna levels were fold higher than that of _PROTEIN_ in leaves and higher in roots . in our immunoprecipitation experiments the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ antisera detected specific bands at and kda respectively which corresponded to the predicted sizes of the deduced polypeptides . consistent with our real time rt pcr results _PROTEIN_ was more abundant than _PROTEIN_ in both tissues . generally _PROTEIN_ protein levels correlated with mrna levels on an equal protein loading basis and using equal antibody dosages in the immunoprecipitation assay . as an initial approach for localizing _PROTEIN_ within the cell we employed transient _PROTEIN_ of an _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion controlled by the camv promoter in arabidopsis leaf protoplasts . the _PROTEIN_ sequence directed _METHOD_ to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ whereas the _METHOD_ alone control was detected uniformly in the _LOCATION_ . the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ construct also lightly labeled some diffuse as well as several distinct punctate intracellular structures . these results suggested that the _PROTEIN_ sequence directed the fused _METHOD_ through the secretory pathway to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . in another study some similar structures were also reported to be labeled with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . transient _PROTEIN_ reveals _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ trafficking to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ of arabidopsis leaf protoplasts using confocal laser scanning microscopy . leaf protoplasts were transfected with the two constructs pbl _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and pbl _METHOD_ alone _METHOD_ and compared with untransfected controls . images were acquired through laser scanning confocal microscopy and include a nm emission filter for _METHOD_ chlorophyll _METHOD_ detected using a nm emission filter and merged _METHOD_ and chlorophyll _METHOD_ . solid white arrowheads label _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in punctate regions while open arrowheads label vesicle like structures . to confirm the results obtained with the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion construct we conducted immunolocalization experiments to determine the localization patterns of native _PROTEIN_ proteins in cells . immunolabeling at the light microscopy level was performed on chemically fixed wild type leaf protoplasts using the anti _PROTEIN_ and anti _PROTEIN_ antisera and an conjugated anti rabbit secondary antiserum . _METHOD_ was specifically detected around the outer fringe of the protoplast coincident with the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . however to obtain a strong signal with the _PROTEIN_ required min longer incubations with the anti _PROTEIN_ antiserum than with the anti _PROTEIN_ antiserum possibly to allow for the antisera to penetrate the protoplast to access the epitope on the _LOCATION_ side of the _LOCATION_ . the negative controls consisted of incubation of fixed protoplasts with the conjugated anti rabbit secondary antibody alone which produced no signal indicating that the immunolocalizations of anti _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ resulted from primary antibody localization and not background binding of the secondary antibody . immunolocalization of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ of arabidopsis leaf protoplasts using confocal laser scanning microscopy . wild type leaf protoplasts were _PROTEIN_ with primary antibodies specific to _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ followed by anti rabbit secondary antibodies . a negative control using only the secondary antibody was also performed . exposures included a nm emission filter for chlorophyll _METHOD_ detected using a nm emission filter or both _METHOD_ and chlorophyll _METHOD_ merged . the evidence of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ targeting and _METHOD_ localization of both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ in protoplasts prompted us to conduct further experiments using electron microscopy of high pressure frozen leaves to obtain higher resolution immunolocalization data . unfortunately the _PROTEIN_ antiserum proved problematic on high pressure frozen and acetone substituted thin tissue sections . however the _PROTEIN_ antiserum gave very specific and clean labeling of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ of epidermal palisade parenchyma and spongy mesophyll cells . slight plasmolysis of the epidermal cells resulted in an increased separation of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ from the cell wall which further highlighted the specificity of immunolabeling in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . immunolocalization of _PROTEIN_ to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ of diverse arabidopsis leaf cells using transmission electron microscopy . bright field cross section view of leaf cells examined ep epidermis p palisade parenchyma sm spongy mesophyll . partially plasmolyzed epidermal cell labeled with anti _PROTEIN_ antiserum and nm gold secondary antibody on _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ of palisade parenchyma cell and spongy mesophyll cell labeled with anti _PROTEIN_ antiserum and nm gold secondary antibody . cell wall cw and cytoplasm cy are denoted in each panel . size bars are in microns or nanometers . controls with secondary antisera alone gave no signal . _PROTEIN_ was also detected in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ of various cell types within the root tip . labeling was especially high in the cells of the meristematic zone columella cells and the root cap . the detection of _PROTEIN_ in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ of the gravity sensing columella cells was especially interesting . we have previously shown that roots from the antisense lines of _PROTEIN_ are impaired in their response to gravity compared to wild type controls _PROTEIN_ . we suggest that the effects of _PROTEIN_ on root gravity response could be mediated by cation transport across the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ of columella cells . immunolocalization of _PROTEIN_ to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ of arabidopsis root cells using tem . transverse section of root tip showing three regions examined under tem labeled with anti _PROTEIN_ antiserum . root meristematic cell _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ root columella cell m mitochondria _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . border tip cell . immunolabeled region in the box from panel c under higher magnification . nm gold anti rabbit secondary antibody used in all labeling . cell wall cw and cytoplasm cy . size bars are in nanometers . to identify all of the intracellular structures containing _PROTEIN_ we have further analyzed immunogold labeled thin sections of high pressure frozen root tip cells using the anti _PROTEIN_ antibody . immunogold particles were observed over _LOCATION_ cisternae _LOCATION_ stacks and emerging trans _LOCATION_ vesicles secretory vesicles and vesicles merging with the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . this labeling pattern is consistent with the hypothesis that _PROTEIN_ is synthesized by _LOCATION_ bound ribosomes passaged through the _LOCATION_ and transported in secretory vesicles to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ which is a pathway that is postulated to be followed by most _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ proteins in plants _PROTEIN_ . in addition anti _PROTEIN_ labeling was also observed in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ over _PROTEIN_ stage cell plates in dividing cells and near cortical microtubule attachment sites . the delivery of _PROTEIN_ to cell plates in the state of formation suggests furthermore that this ion transporter is of fundamental importance to _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ function in dividing root tip cells . immunolocalization of _PROTEIN_ to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ vesicles of arabidopsis root cells using transmission electron microscopy . _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ apparatus labeled with anti _PROTEIN_ antiserum . arrows denote nm immunogold particles of anti rabbit secondary antiserum . size bars are in nanometers . characterization of _PROTEIN_ associated with vesicles and cell plate . immunogold labeling of cytoplasmic vesicle and vesicles merging with _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ pm . black arrowhead indicates nm immunogold in pm . three immunogold particles from anti _PROTEIN_ antiserum labeling on edge of vesicle cell plate formation with anti _PROTEIN_ antiserum labeling indicated with black arrowheads . _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . multiple vesicles present in cytoplasm labeled with anti _PROTEIN_ antiserum anti _PROTEIN_ antibody labeling near cortical microtubule attachments . cw cell wall . size bars are in nanometers . the overall labeling of the anti _PROTEIN_ antibody over leaf and root cells roots was quantitated on a per cell basis . labeling was four fold higher in cap meristem and columella cells of roots than xylem cells of roots . this suggests that _PROTEIN_ was not a major channel for cation loading of xylem cells in roots . likewise labeling over leaves was on average one fourth the level of labeling in root tip cells . the higher abundance of _PROTEIN_ labeling in roots relative to leaves was in agreement with the _PROTEIN_ analysis and suggests that _PROTEIN_ plays a more predominant role in roots . quantitation of labeling of root and leaf cells with the anti _PROTEIN_ antiserum . the number of immuno gold particles from the anti rabbit secondary antibody were counted for each cell type which included root cap columella meristem and xylem leaf spongy mesophyll and palisade parenchyma . data represents average immunogold particles from cells per experiment standard _LOCATION_ . to test for the ability of _PROTEIN_ to mediate k transport in an independent heterologous system we transiently _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in cells . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ distinctly labels the periphery and some endomembrane structures of the cell whereas _METHOD_ alone labels the cell somewhat uniformly . immunoprecipitation assays indicated that the two constructs were _PROTEIN_ and that _PROTEIN_ was fused to _METHOD_ based on the predicted size on _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . in patch clamp assays we observed that heterologously _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ conducted significant inward k currents with the application of dibutyryl cgmp in the _LOCATION_ recording solution demonstrating the activation of these channels . we also observed significant outward currents which may be carried by n methyl d _PROTEIN_ a large organic cation through the _PROTEIN_ . further work is therefore needed to characterize the selectivity of _PROTEIN_ for small and large cations and the role of calmodulin and cyclic nucleotides in channel regulation . _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in cells and patch clamp assays . transient _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ alone in the vector and the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion in cells and visualized under the _METHOD_ microscope . hek cells were fixed with dimethyl formamide and stained with propidium iodide _METHOD_ . distinct _METHOD_ labeling of peripheral _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ is marked . immunoprecipitation of the cells _PROTEIN_ each construct with and without the inducer tetracycline tet is shown . the bands corresponding to the _METHOD_ alone and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion are labeled . the fc region of the antiserum used in immunoprecipitation is marked . proteins were detected on immunoblots with the anti _PROTEIN_ antibody . non transfected hek cell showed no measurable current . hek cell transfected with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ showed large inward and outward currents in asymmetrical solution consisting of k nmdgin . shown are leak subtracted currents generated from command voltages between to mv in the presence of dibutyryl cgmp . the ability of _PROTEIN_ to rescue e. coli and yeast mutants defective in k transport _PROTEIN_ combined with the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ localization of _PROTEIN_ in a variety of cells and cation transport in heterologous cells shown here is consistent with its role in regulating cellular expansion through k transport _PROTEIN_ via the acid growth _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . antisense knockdown lines of _PROTEIN_ had smaller parenchyma cells and leaves and were disrupted in rates of root growth and gravitropic bending _PROTEIN_ . therefore it is reasonable to propose that is involved in cation uptake in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ of root and leaf cells . in addition _PROTEIN_ may also be involved in cation transport across the _LOCATION_ of the vesicles in which it was detected . the inability to isolate a true knockout of _PROTEIN_ and the observed haploinsufficiency _PROTEIN_ combined with the cell biological data observed here further support our contention that _PROTEIN_ is an essential gene in plants .
