lipid transfer proteins _PROTEIN_ are small secretory proteins in plants with defined lipid binding structures for possible lipid exocytosis . special groups of _PROTEIN_ unique to the anther tapetum are abundant but their functions are unclear . we studied a special group of _PROTEIN_ type iii _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis . their transcripts were restricted to the anther tapetum with levels peaking at the developmental stage of maximal pollen wall exine synthesis . we constructed an _PROTEIN_ green _METHOD_ protein _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ plasmid transformed it into wild type plants and monitored _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in developing anthers with confocal laser scanning microscopy . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ appeared in the tapetum and was secreted via the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ trans _LOCATION_ network machinery into the locule . it then moved to the microspore surface and remained as a component of exine . immuno transmission electron microscopy of native _PROTEIN_ in anthers confirmed the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ observations . the in vivo association of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and exine in anthers was not observed with non type iii or structurally modified type iii _PROTEIN_ or in transformed exine defective mutant plants . rna interference knockdown of individual type iii _PROTEIN_ produced no observable mutant phenotypes . rna interference knockdown of two type iii _PROTEIN_ produced microscopy observable morphologic changes in the intine underneath the exine and pollen susceptible to dehydration damage . overall we reveal a novel transfer pathway of _PROTEIN_ in which _PROTEIN_ bound or nonbound to exine precursors are secreted from the tapetum to become microspore exine constituents this pathway explains the need for plentiful _PROTEIN_ to incorporate into the abundant exine .
the _PROTEIN_ of the individual _PROTEIN_ paralogs in arabidopsis was diverse or restricted in various plant parts as revealed by affymetrix microarray data . _PROTEIN_ encoded by paralogs exhibiting diverse _PROTEIN_ would putatively perform a housekeeping function . _PROTEIN_ encoded by paralogs exhibiting restricted _PROTEIN_ would play a role unique to the specific plant parts . our laboratory has been elucidating the mechanism of action of the anther tapetum . in this project we paid attention to _PROTEIN_ paralogs exhibiting restricted _PROTEIN_ in inflorescence . an inflorescence includes metabolically active tapeta microspores and carpels as well as _PROTEIN_ sepals and various other cell types . therefore _PROTEIN_ transcripts restricted to inflorescence are not necessarily present exclusively largely or at all in the tapetum . affymetrix microarray data shown in arbitrary units of absolute signal intensity are from nasc . the _PROTEIN_ type mr and pi data are from citation . the flower bud stages were defined according to the arabidopsis information resource . low levels of the _PROTEIN_ transcripts in other plant parts are shown . type iii _PROTEIN_ transcripts are highlighted in boldface . we chose type iii _PROTEIN_ whose transcripts are restricted to inflorescence for further studies . type iii _PROTEIN_ have an uncharacteristic low pi of approximately in arabidopsis fewer than residues _PROTEIN_ and no potential glycophosphatidylinositol modification site . their genes possess an intron at a dna site not found in genes of other _PROTEIN_ types . levels of type iii _PROTEIN_ transcripts peaked at an early stage of flower development designated stages to by the nottingham arabidopsis stock centre . in a _METHOD_ parallel signature sequencing analysis of a mixture of inflorescences of stages to the transcript levels of two of the three type iii _PROTEIN_ combined represented of the total transcripts per million . these inflorescences contain several groups of metabolically active cells/tissues including tapeta microspores and pollen in anthers various cell types in the carpel _PROTEIN_ and sepals and others . because all of the type iii transcripts are restricted to the tapetum in anthers at an early developmental stage their presence in the tapetum at the peak transcript stage could be several percent of the total mrna . the high percentage of type iii _PROTEIN_ transcripts estimated to be in the tapetum of arabidopsis reflects that found experimentally in the tapetum of rice from which anthers at specific developmental stages could be obtained for more precise analysis . during flower development transcript levels of _GENE_ and increased and peaked at stages to and then _PROTEIN_ in a similar pattern whereas that of had a slightly delayed developmental timing . we focused on two type iii _PROTEIN_ in all subsequent studies _GENE_ with transcripts having a developmental pattern similar to those of and with transcripts having a delayed developmental timing . we explored the subflower location of type iii _PROTEIN_ transcripts . we attached the _PROTEIN_ gene promoter of approximately kb to a _METHOD_ gene and transformed the dna construct into wild type plants . in transformed plants the _METHOD_ signal appeared in developing anthers and peaked at stages and and was restricted to the tapetum of the whole flower . other cells of the anthers including microspores and the epidermis as well as other inflorescence cells and other cells of the whole plants showed no _METHOD_ signal . although the tapetum in most higher plants is described as secretory the mechanism of subcellular tapetum secretion has not been explored in much detail until recently with maize . the mode of secretion of _PROTEIN_ from the tapetum has not been explored . in this study with arabidopsis transmission electron microscopy revealed abundant rough _LOCATION_ occasional _LOCATION_ bodies and the trans _LOCATION_ network . the presence of rough _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ bodies in the tapetum cells has been observed by others . in the arabidopsis tapetum the secretory organelles were distributed throughout the cell rather than concentrated in the cell portion near the locule as in maize . intact tapetum cells from anthers of plants transformed with an _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ construct which included the _GENE_ promoter and coding region tagged with _METHOD_ at the terminus were examined by confocal laser scanning microscopy _PROTEIN_ for _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and immunoprocessed calnexin _LOCATION_ . _PROTEIN_ and calnexin were each present as a network distributed extensively throughout the cell . the two networks overlapped substantially but not completely . in our study of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signal overlapped with the calnexin signal and of the calnexin signal overlapped with the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signal . the nonoverlapping regions of _PROTEIN_ could represent tgn and nearby vesicles or different _LOCATION_ subdomains . tgn revealed via immunodetection of its marker _PROTEIN_ had a more restricted distribution within the cell it overlapped with only of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ network and of the _PROTEIN_ signal overlapped with the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signal . we further tested the idea that the export of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was mediated by the vesicular transport system involving _LOCATION_ tgn . stage anthers from transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were treated with brefeldin a an inhibitor of the vesicular transport system . disrupting the transport pathway with bfa would block the export of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ out of the tapetum cells and result in the accumulation of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ inside the cells . in stage anthers _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were being secreted out of the tapetum cell and the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signals were mostly present in the locule space between microspore mother cells as well as in the apoplastic space between the tapetum cells . these _LOCATION_ spaces of the locule are apparently interconnected because _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signals can be seen to freely flow within the spaces in a live recording . the _PROTEIN_ signals were relatively fewer inside the tapetum cells . after h of incubation in bfa the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signals increased by about inside the tapetum cells signifying blocking of the _LOCATION_ tgn transport system . in contrast the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signals in tapetum cells of anthers after incubation without bfa increased only about in comparison with cells at h. in both bfa treated and untreated anthers the overall _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signals _PROTEIN_ by about after the incubation and the locule space among microspore mother cells and the tapetum became less defined presumably because the anthers had been removed from their natural growth condition . this loss of sharpness was more pronounced in bfa treated anthers likely due to the effect of bfa on both the tapetum and microspore mother cells . the overall observation in figure supports the idea that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were exported via the _LOCATION_ tgn pathway . we traced the locations of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in anthers during development in plants transformed with a type iii _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ construct which included the promoter and coding region . the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ signal first appeared in the tapetum at early stage when microspores were in tetrads . at _PROTEIN_ stage and stage _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was abundant in the locule with _PROTEIN_ amounts in the still intact tapetum . at stage _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ appeared both in the locule and on the microspore surface . eventually at stage most of the _METHOD_ was present on the microspore surface . beginning at stage and onward the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ became weaker and gradually disappeared . presumably the _METHOD_ properties of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ vanished after its association with and modifications in the microspore wall . we detected the association of _GENE_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ with the microspore surface in stage anthers of transformed plants . for convenience and direct comparison we removed the microspores from anthers and monitored the microspore surface _METHOD_ . in nontransformed plants no _METHOD_ _METHOD_ other than faint background _METHOD_ was present on microspores . in transformed plants _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was associated with the microspore surface overlapping with the _METHOD_ of the pollen wall . after the microspores had been stained with tinopal for the cellulosic cell wall _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was present together with _PROTEIN_ and also slightly exterior to the tinopal stain . we tested whether the binding of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ to the microspore surface required the _PROTEIN_ protein per se . in transformed plants with _METHOD_ attached only to the _PROTEIN_ signal peptide _PROTEIN_ signal peptide _METHOD_ was not found on microspores . overall _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was present in the exine of microspores and the domain required for association was the _PROTEIN_ per se . a similar finding but with fewer details of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ overlapping with pollen wall _METHOD_ is shown in supplemental figure . the location of native _GENE_ _PROTEIN_ without the _METHOD_ tag in nontransformed plants was explored with immuno tem . we generated rabbit polyclonal antibodies against a synthetic peptide unique to the c terminal region of _GENE_ . immunoblotting after _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ revealed that the antibodies were specific for _GENE_ with a very slight reactivity toward its closest paralog protein and that _GENE_ occurred at an early stage of flower development . for immuno tem anthers were treated with a freeze fixation procedure to preserve proteins in the aqueous locule . in stage anthers with the exine just formed immunogold particles were present largely in the nexine and sexine of exine and some in the locule . electron dense particles inside the microspore protoplasts were mostly larger and irregularly shaped and were not immunogold particles . at an earlier stage immediately before the exine appeared most of the immunogold particles were present in the locule . tabulation with statistical analysis of immunogold particles in the anther locule and exine indicates that there was a shift in immunogold particles from the locule to the exine from stage to stage this shift is consistent with the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ shown in figure . the immunogold particles in the tapetum cells and the intracellular microspores throughout development were considered to have arisen from random labeling based on statistical analysis reflecting the well known high background in the relatively nonspecific immunogold detection compared with the sensitive and highly specific _METHOD_ _METHOD_ detection . we tested whether _METHOD_ tagged type iii _PROTEIN_ with modified structures would target to microspores in transformed plants . an _PROTEIN_ molecule has eight conserved cys residues which form four defined disulfide bridges for a three dimensional structure . the four bridges in type iii _PROTEIN_ are shown in figure . we altered the first cys residue _METHOD_ or the eighth cys residue _METHOD_ to an ala residue by modifying the codon in _GENE_ and then attached _METHOD_ to the dna construct for plant transformation . neither of the two modified _GENE_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ proteins was present on microspores of transformed plants . we also tested whether _METHOD_ tagged non type iii _PROTEIN_ would target microspores in transformed plants . transcripts of and encoding type ix _PROTEIN_ were present mostly in inflorescence and appeared slightly before type iii _PROTEIN_ transcripts during flower development and the transcripts of _GENE_ encoding type i were abundant in leaves . in plants transformed with the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ driven by the _GENE_ promoter a trace of _METHOD_ was present whereas the other two _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were absent on microspores . arabidopsis knockout mutants defective in the synthesis or transport of exine precursors produce pollen with highly degenerated exine and lacking the ability to germinate . the mutant _PROTEIN_ is defective in producing fatty acyl coa synthase in the tapetum whose enzymic product is likely a precursor of exine . the mutant _PROTEIN_ is defective in producing the abcg transporter in the tapetum for exine precursor export . we tested whether _GENE_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ would target microspores in transformed exine defective mutants . the proteins did not target microspores in the two transformed mutants . in the control wild type _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was present in the locule at stage and on microspores at stage . in the two mutants _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was present in the locule at both stages which indicates the successful secretion of the protein to the locule from the tapetum but the failure of the protein to bind to the microspore surface . arabidopsis transfer dna knockout mutants of _GENE_ and are unavailable . earlier antisense knockdown of the transcripts of an ortholog of in b. napus led to no observable mutation phenotype . in our study we generated rna interference knockdown mutants of _GENE_ or and observed with tem no apparent changes in the microspore surface . we further generated an rnai vector driven by the _GENE_ promoter which could create double knockdown mutants of _GENE_ and . reverse transcription pcr showed that in the studied transgenic lines the transcript levels of _GENE_ and were specifically and substantially reduced . nonetheless these lines all produced fertile pollen . we chose two lines _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ which had the fewest transcripts of _GENE_ and for further study . scanning electron microscopy of mature pollen revealed no apparent difference in the surface structure between the mutants and the wild type . tem also revealed no appreciable and consistent difference in the exine and coat materials between the mutants and the wild type . however the intine of microspores at stage was consistently less electron dense in _PROTEIN_ than in the wild type and appeared to have separated from the exine and the microspore _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . we consider it unlikely that the observed morphological defect of the intine in the mutant compared with the wild type was a tem fixation artifact because the two types of anthers were fixed and processed for tem in the same experiment and six different anthers of each type showed similar intine disparity . the disparity could be related to changes unobserved by tem in the exine of the mutant which would affect the penetration of fixatives from the microspore surface to the underneath intine or physically the proper formation of the underlying intine by microspores . _PROTEIN_ the disparity in the intine of the mutant and the wild type was also manifested with intine specific tinopal staining the stain was fragmented in the mutant but continuous in the wild type . finally we tested whether the mutants as a consequence of unobserved deficiency in the exine trickling down to the observed deficiency in the intine would produce pollen that was more susceptible to dehydration . pollen was placed at relative humidity and for to h and then allowed to germinate on an agar medium . pollen of the mutants germinated as well as that of the wild type before dehydration treatment but became less viable after to h of dehydration . the lack of a drastic pollen deficiency in the mutants could reflect that _GENE_ and perform a redundant function that the knockdowns were insufficient and that the third type iii _PROTEIN_ alone would be sufficient to carry out the function .

and _METHOD_ . the cdna encoding regions of _GENE_ and _GENE_ as well as the cys mutant fragment of _GENE_ were amplified by rt pcr with primer pairs containing specific restriction sites . the cdna fragments were cloned into the ncoi/spei sites of _GENE_ _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ to generate _GENE_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . for _GENE_ and the pcr fragments were cloned into the ncoi/spei sites by sticky end pcr because of the presence of ncoi sites in the coding region . all constructs were confirmed by sequencing . for the rnai _PROTEIN_ vector the promoter of phellsgate was replaced with the _GENE_ promoter . first the kb promoter dna of _GENE_ and a negative selectable marker were amplified by pcr with primers containing saci/hpai and hpai/kpni sites respectively . the two pcr fragments were digested with saci and kpni respectively fused by ligase and cloned into kpni/saci digested phellsgate to replace the ccdb cassette . the product was denoted _GENE_ _PROTEIN_ . cdna fragments encoded by _GENE_ and were ligated and conjugated with the attb recombination site by pcr . first pcr was used to generate a megaprimer from cdna with the primers linker f
