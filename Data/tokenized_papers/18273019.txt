cell autonomous immunity is widespread in plant fungus interactions and terminates fungal pathogenesis either at the cell surface or after pathogen entry . although post invasive resistance responses typically coincide with a self contained cell death of plant cells undergoing attack by parasites these cells survive pre invasive defence . mutational analysis in arabidopsis identified _PROTEIN_ syntaxin as one component of two pre invasive resistance pathways against ascomycete powdery mildew fungi . here we show that _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ resident _PROTEIN_ promiscuously _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ resistant soluble n ethylmaleimide sensitive _PROTEIN_ attachment protein receptor complexes together with the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and a subset of vesicle associated _LOCATION_ proteins . _PROTEIN_ dependent disease resistance acts in vivo _PROTEIN_ through two functionally redundant subfamily members _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . unexpectedly the same two vamp proteins also operate redundantly in a default secretory pathway suggesting dual functions in separate biological processes owing to evolutionary co option of the default pathway for plant immunity . the disease resistance function of the secretory _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ complex and the pathogen induced subcellular dynamics of its components are mechanistically reminiscent of immunological synapse formation in vertebrates enabling execution of immune responses through focal secretion .
arabidopsis is immune to non _PROTEIN_ powdery mildew fungi such as blumeria graminis and _LOCATION_ pisi which in nature colonize grass and pea species respectively . this non host resistance requires both pre and post invasive immune responses which are under separate genetic control . the former response engages _PROTEIN_ syntaxin peroxisomal _PROTEIN_ glycosyl hydrolase and the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ resident _PROTEIN_ abc transporter . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ act in the same pathway and are implicated in the cytoplasmic synthesis and transport of small antimicrobial compounds across the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ at attempted fungal entry sites respectively . _PROTEIN_ syntaxin acts in a second pathway and could by analogy to known syntaxin functions in yeast and animals either participate in vesicle fusion processes or modulate ion channel activity through interactions with _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ resident ion channels . genetic studies defy mechanistic interpretations but suggest direct or indirect _PROTEIN_ repressor activity in defence responses that are dependent on salicylic acid as well as an overlapping function with the closely related syntaxin of plant _PROTEIN_ . compared with largely resistant _PROTEIN_ wild type and severely defence compromised _PROTEIN_ null mutants plants containing the _PROTEIN_ allele allow intermediate b. graminis entry rates indicating residual _PROTEIN_ resistance activity . in the deduced _PROTEIN_ protein a glycine residue is substituted by a glutamate in the snare domain . because this mutation affects a hydrophobic residue that is thought to stabilize interactions with other snare proteins in hetero oligomeric snare complexes and is conserved in the subfamily we hypothesized that _PROTEIN_ might be impaired in snare complex formation . immunoblot analysis of leaf protein samples from wild type _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ plants with a _PROTEIN_ antiserum showed that monomeric _PROTEIN_ and wild type _PROTEIN_ levels are indistinguishable and that _PROTEIN_ is undetectable thus demonstrating that the amino acid exchange in _PROTEIN_ does not affect protein stability . notably this analysis revealed small amounts of an _PROTEIN_ resistant and heat labile _PROTEIN_ containing complex in wild type plants whose abundance increased upon fungal inoculation . this complex migrated at about kilodaltons and was undetectable in _PROTEIN_ plants . because _PROTEIN_ resistance and heat sensitivity are typical features of exocytic ternary snare complexes in yeast and animals we concluded that in planta _PROTEIN_ either has a specific defect in snare complex formation or that _PROTEIN_ complex is unstable . binary target _LOCATION_ snare complexes are typically formed by a syntaxin and at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ during exocytosis . hence we examined the _PROTEIN_ of all three arabidopsis homologues _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in leaves the target tissue of powdery mildew fungi by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and detected exclusively _PROTEIN_ transcripts . upon _PROTEIN_ with powdery mildew both _PROTEIN_ transcript and protein increased in abundance . _PROTEIN_ assembled in planta in a pathogen inducible _PROTEIN_ resistant complex of similar size to the _PROTEIN_ complex and is capable of interacting in vitro with _PROTEIN_ . analysis of transgenic arabidopsis plants co _PROTEIN_ functional fluorochrome marked yellow _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and cyan _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion proteins revealed co localization and focal accumulation of both proteins at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ beneath incipient powdery mildew entry sites . together these findings suggest that _PROTEIN_ cooperates with _PROTEIN_ at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . however lethality of _PROTEIN_ mutants before flowering associated with dwarfism cytokinetic defects and necrotic leaf lesion formation points to additional _PROTEIN_ engagement in essential cellular processes . exocytosis is completed by vesicle fusion with target _LOCATION_ and this is thought to be driven by complex formation of t snares with vesicle snares also called vesicle associated _LOCATION_ proteins . the arabidopsis genome harbours vamp encoding genes which fall into two subfamilies . the detection of in planta _PROTEIN_ containing snare complex prompted us to devise an in vitro systematic snare complex survey using purified arabidopsis snare proteins that were _PROTEIN_ in escherichia coli . we detected _PROTEIN_ resistant snare complexes by incubating _PROTEIN_ and glutathione s transferase _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ bound to glutathione sepharose with various vamps . sedimented bead bound _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was released and detected by immunoblot analysis using a _PROTEIN_ antibody . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was able to form _PROTEIN_ resistant and heat sensitive complexes in the presence of _PROTEIN_ and each of four tested members of the subfamily but not with _PROTEIN_ . barely detectable _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ complexes were seen in the presence of other subfamily members _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ suggesting that _PROTEIN_ associates preferentially with subfamily members . importantly when _PROTEIN_ was replaced by _PROTEIN_ complex formation was undetectable in the presence of _PROTEIN_ and was reduced upon incubation with the other family members _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . the presumed presence of all three snare proteins _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in the _PROTEIN_ resistant complex was validated by differential protein tagging _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and immunoblot analysis using anti anti _PROTEIN_ and anti ha antibodies respectively . pairwise association tests showed that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ do not associate alone under our experimental conditions and that _PROTEIN_ has a _PROTEIN_ affinity for _PROTEIN_ . moreover _PROTEIN_ resistant complex formation required the presence of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ demonstrating that all three snare proteins cooperate in vitro . this and the lack of an in planta _PROTEIN_ resistant _PROTEIN_ complex identifies _PROTEIN_ as potential major v snare partner of _PROTEIN_ . however the residual _PROTEIN_ disease resistance activity to b. graminis suggests that either additional family members contribute to _PROTEIN_ function or that unstable _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ complexes retain in planta residual activity . to address this we used a genetic approach and selected homozygous t dna insertion lines for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . all t dna lines showed wild type like entry rates of b. graminis into leaf epidermal cells indicating potential genetic redundancy . because _PROTEIN_ is most closely sequence related to _PROTEIN_ we aimed to isolate _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant lines . we generated plants that were homozygous mutant for either _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ and heterozygous for the respective other gene and analysed the genotypes of their progeny from selfings . among progeny tested however there were no plants that were homozygous mutant for both genes . this suggests fully penetrant lethality of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutants and essential as well as redundant wild type gene functions in development . moreover closer inspection of the segregation ratios of progeny genotypes recovered from the two parental lines _PROTEIN_ / _PROTEIN_ / and _PROTEIN_ / _PROTEIN_ / indicated a deviation from the expected segregation but this was statistically significant only for the latter . this reveals an additional gametophytic activity that is normally not apparent because of the redundant _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ function in diploid plants . interestingly _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ appear to act in compensating pathways as _PROTEIN_ transcript abundance was markedly increased in the homozygous _PROTEIN_ single mutant background . a similar though less dramatic compensatory _PROTEIN_ transcript increase was found in homozygous _PROTEIN_ plants . transgenic gene silencing lines in which both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ transcript levels were specifically and severely reduced grew normally for about two weeks . thereafter necrotic leaf lesions appeared and the plants exhibited an overall dwarf stature that was accompanied by a reduction of leaf mesophyll cell size of approximately . because the same phenotype appears with the same timing in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutants this might indicate overlapping _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ functions . next we generated transgenic arabidopsis lines for conditional _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ co silencing using the ethanol inducible alc system . using low concentrations of ethanol vapour applied to two week old plants and subsequent _PROTEIN_ with b. graminis spores we identified multiple lines in which fungal entry rates were significantly elevated in an inducer dependent manner that is showing a _PROTEIN_ phenocopy . because elevated fungal entry was observed without recognizable pleiotropic plant growth effects and correlated with a reduction of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ transcript levels this provides genetic evidence for a _PROTEIN_ function in disease resistance that can be uncoupled from their essential role in development . for direct in planta _PROTEIN_ immunodetection we generated an anti _PROTEIN_ antibody using the _LOCATION_ part of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . this antibody specifically detected both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ sharing identical amino acid residues . analysis of the steady state level of both proteins in leaf extracts showed dependence on gene dosage and revealed that the relative amount of _PROTEIN_ apparently greatly exceeds that of _PROTEIN_ . we used protein extracts from transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ functional _PROTEIN_ myc driven by a kilobase native promoter sequence in a _PROTEIN_ background for co immunoprecipitation experiments with the anti myc antibody . anti myc immune complexes contained both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . likewise immunoprecipitation experiments with extracts from transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ functional green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ driven by the promoter in a _PROTEIN_ background revealed in anti _METHOD_ immune complexes the presence of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . together this provides direct evidence for in planta _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ ternary snare complexes . to investigate the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ in living plant cells in response to fungal attack we generated transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fused to _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ under the control of kb native regulatory _PROTEIN_ sequences in the _PROTEIN_ background . these lines showed a pathogen inducible accumulation of functional _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ as indicated by immunoblot analysis of leaf protein extracts and restored resistance to fungal entry . confocal microscopy revealed focal accumulation of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ intracellular compartments in single attacked leaf epidermal cells directly beneath b. graminis appressoria . whereas the _PROTEIN_ accumulation of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ is similar to the focal concentration of _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ resident _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ at incipient entry sites the former marks a different compartment . _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ tagged structures differing in size were distinguishable . this is reminiscent of compound exocytosis in mammals in which vesicles fuse with each other before their fusion with the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and/or represents aggregation of the punctuate compartments seen in healthy plants . in response to _PROTEIN_ with e. pisi _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ at the leaf mid vein region was detectable only in single attacked epidermal cells and characterized by a directed movement of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ tagged compartments to the fungal invasion site . in contrast epidermal pavement cells of healthy unchallenged plants showed low abundance and random distribution of _METHOD_ structures . collectively these data are consistent with a pathogen inducible _PROTEIN_ mediated delivery of secretory compartments to incipient fungal entry sites . pathogen induced de novo cell wall biosynthesis beneath fungal appressoria is delayed in _PROTEIN_ plants compared with wild type . we investigated in time course experiments _PROTEIN_ mediated callose formation as a marker of this process in wild type _PROTEIN_ and transgenic lines in which _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are constitutively co silenced . the incidence of callose formation in the silencing lines was lower relative to wild type at all inspected time points and similar to _PROTEIN_ plants . this hints to a common role for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in focal secretion at fungal entry sites and is consistent with the hypothesis that _PROTEIN_ syntaxin acts through an authentic snare complex by association with _PROTEIN_ . barley and are orthologues of arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and are known to restrict entry of b. graminis into epidermal cells of barley leaves . we searched the harvest barley est database and identified one unigene contig that encodes a presumptive orthologue of arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ . as in arabidopsis each of _METHOD_ labelled and accumulate at incipient powdery mildew entry sites . transient single cell co _PROTEIN_ of fluorophore tagged fusion proteins coupled with resonance energy transfer analysis based on _METHOD_ lifetime imaging revealed pairwise in vivo interactions between and thereby supporting their capacity to cooperate in planta . concentration of these barley snare proteins at fungal entry sites and in vivo interactions in the absence of the pathogen suggest that their dual function in immunity and cellular housekeeping is evolutionarily conserved . we noted that the compensatory _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ is abolished in _PROTEIN_ / _PROTEIN_ / and _PROTEIN_ / _PROTEIN_ / arabidopsis plants . moreover the transcript levels in these genotypes upon _PROTEIN_ with b. graminis are even lower than those in wild type and _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ single mutants . this and the dependence on gene dosage of _PROTEIN_ steady state levels prompted us to examine potentially impaired non host disease resistance to b. graminis in _PROTEIN_ / _PROTEIN_ / and _PROTEIN_ / _PROTEIN_ / genotypes . only the former genotype allowed enhanced fungal entry into leaf epidermal cells which was similar to the phenotype seen upon conditional co silencing of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . likewise inoculation of the same genotypes with non _PROTEIN_ e. pisi spores allowed elevated fungal entry rates only on _PROTEIN_ / _PROTEIN_ / plants . thus in the absence of the entry control function of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ becomes haplo insufficient to both tested non _PROTEIN_ powdery mildews . intriguingly _PROTEIN_ / _PROTEIN_ / plants were hyper susceptible to the virulent oomycete hyaloperonospora parasitica as indicated by elevated spore production at six days post inoculation . this reveals _PROTEIN_ haplo insufficiency in a homozygous _PROTEIN_ background and demonstrates that both vamps contribute to disease resistance against different pathogen classes . to test whether a similar resistance function restricts the growth of an _PROTEIN_ powdery mildew we inoculated the respective genotypes with spores of golovinomyces orontii . both _PROTEIN_ / _PROTEIN_ / and _PROTEIN_ / _PROTEIN_ / plants were hyper susceptible to g. orontii . this demonstrates that immune responses to non _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ pathogens engage common secretory components and that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ contribute to a wider range of defence responses than _PROTEIN_ . however bacterial growth of pseudomonas syringae was indistinguishable between the tested plant genotypes . this and the disease resistance function of nicotiana benthamiana against p. syringae a syntaxin that belongs to a different syp subfamily than _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ suggest that plants use a separate secretory pathway to restrict bacterial growth . to our knowledge we provide for the first time biochemical and genetic evidence for ternary snare complex functions in plants . our findings show that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ complexes are required for immune responses to powdery mildew/oomycete pathogens and that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ act redundantly during development thereby revealing dual functions in separate biological processes . reduced gametophytic transmission of the _PROTEIN_ and/or _PROTEIN_ mutation the lethality of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutants and plant dwarfism in gene silencing lines probably reflect perturbation of an ancient default secretory pathway which is essential for viability of plant cells . both gene silencing lines and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutants exhibit severe dwarfism . however unlike the lethal _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ genotype _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutants can be propagated as true breeding lines . thus the default activity of _PROTEIN_ can not act solely through _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ but is likely to engage additional syntaxins . similarly the immune response function of _PROTEIN_ can not act solely through _PROTEIN_ because the vamps contribute to a wider range of defence responses than _PROTEIN_ . collectively our findings suggest that arabidopsis has co opted the pre existing _PROTEIN_ dependent secretion apparatus for immune responses to pathogens . in one scenario the default transport pathway could be re used to deliver pathogen inducible cargo . the broad spectrum activity of the identified vamps against an ascomycete and oomycete parasite and the delay in pathogen inducible cell wall reinforcement in transgenic lines predict broadly effective antimicrobials and cell wall components as candidate cargo . focal concentration of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ at pathogen entry sites and the resistance function of the corresponding snare complex provide a missing link to synthesize observations on seemingly diverse pathogen induced cellular re distribution events . this involves the disassembly and _PROTEIN_ re assembly of the actin _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ re distribution of intracellular organelles including _PROTEIN_ containing _LOCATION_ and the formation of lipid raft like _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ microdomains underneath pathogen entry sites . this and the requirement of the secretory snare complex for pre invasion resistance are mechanistically strikingly similar to the formation of the immunological synapse in vertebrates for effective immune responses through focal secretion . cytotoxic t lymphocytes kill antigen presenting cells by secreting perforin and serine proteases upon recognition of non self peptides presented by _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ resident major histocompatibility complexes . in interactions with the non _PROTEIN_ b. graminis and e. pisi powdery mildews the resistance response restricts fungal entry into leaf epidermal cells . because of the focal accumulation of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ beneath appressoria we conclude that focal secretion terminates pathogenesis in a process that resembles the immunological synapse formation . unlike powdery mildews that exclusively infect epidermal cells h. parasitica retrieves nutrients _PROTEIN_ from mesophyll cells by differentiation of ramified hyphae in the apoplastic space of mesophyll tissue . thus the observed hyper susceptibility to g. orontii and h. parasitica implies impaired _PROTEIN_ secretory activity both in epidermal and mesophyll cells . activated t cells release different cargos by distinct secretory pathways besides focal secretion through the immunological synapse multi directional secretion is used to promote inflammation . because _PROTEIN_ powdery mildews such as g. orontii or e. cichoracearum have overcome pre invasion resistance hyper susceptibility to g. orontii could be partly due to reduced non directional _PROTEIN_ secretory activity from neighbouring cells .

x and probed with anti anti _PROTEIN_ or anti ha antibody to detect _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or ha _PROTEIN_ respectively . to detect _PROTEIN_ a polyclonal anti _PROTEIN_ antiserum was raised in a rabbit using the _LOCATION_ part of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ differ by only four amino acids . to study interactions between _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in planta co
