post translational protein modification plays a pivotal role in the regulation and specific turnover of proteins . one of these important modifications is the ubiquitination of target proteins which can occur at distinct cellular compartments . at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ ubiquitination regulates the internalization and thus trafficking of _LOCATION_ proteins such as receptors and channels . the arabidopsis plant u box armadillo repeat ubiquitin ligase _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is part of the ubiquitination machinery at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . in contrast to most other pub arm proteins _PROTEIN_ carries additional c terminal arm repeats responsible for _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ association . here we demonstrated that the c terminal arm repeat domain is also essential and sufficient to mediate _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ association of the closest arabidopis paralog _PROTEIN_ . we investigated targeting of pub arm ubiquitin ligases of different plant species to find out whether _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ association of _PROTEIN_ type pub arm proteins is conserved . phylogenetic analysis identified orthologs of _PROTEIN_ in these plant species . intracellular localization of transiently _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion proteins revealed that indeed _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ association due to additional c terminal arm repeats represents a conserved feature of _PROTEIN_ type proteins . analyses of transgenic arabidopsis plants overexpressing n terminally masked or truncated proteins revealed that interfering with the function of _PROTEIN_ type proteins resulted in severe growth defects . our results suggest an ancient origin of ubiquitination at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ in the evolution of land plants .
_LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ association was observed for the two _PROTEIN_ paralogs _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ but not for any other member of the arabidopsis pub arm protein family _PROTEIN_ . for _PROTEIN_ it has been demonstrated that this specific localization depends on the additional arm repeat domain in the c terminus that is unique to _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . the domain structure of _PROTEIN_ is schematically depicted in figure . to test whether the c terminal arm repeat domain is also essential for _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ association of _PROTEIN_ we analyzed the localization of fusion proteins between _METHOD_ and truncated _PROTEIN_ proteins by confocal laser scanning microscopy on transformed arabidopsis protoplasts . as for _PROTEIN_ deletion of the n terminal part of _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ proteins did not result in the loss of _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ association . this deletion protein however was not equally distributed in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ but occurred in large patches . a similar pattern has been observed for _PROTEIN_ proteins with truncated and/or masked n terminus previously _PROTEIN_ . in a next step either arm repeats or were deleted in _PROTEIN_ . both proteins _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were localized to the cytoplasm and not to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . these data indicated that indeed the c terminal arm repeat domain is essential and sufficient for _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ association of _PROTEIN_ and that this is a general feature of _PROTEIN_ type ubiquitin ligases . the analysis of transgenic arabidopsis plants overexpressing _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ showed that the c terminus by itself had no effect on plant growth and development . to test whether masking the n terminus of _PROTEIN_ type proteins which eventually leads to patchy distribution of the protein at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ may affect growth and development we analyzed _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ plants . indeed overexpression of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion proteins resulted in a severe growth defect when compared to growth of wildtype plants . involvement of c terminal arm repeats in _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ association of

members of this protein family namely and possess an elongated c terminus and carry an additional c terminal arm repeat domain like their arabidopsis orthologs . we investigated whether the rice _PROTEIN_ orthologs were also associated to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . for that purpose _METHOD_ fusion proteins were _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis protoplasts and their _METHOD_ analyzed by confocal laser scanning microscopy . _METHOD_ _METHOD_ indicated _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ association of _METHOD_ . to confirm this localization _METHOD_ was co _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . the _PROTEIN_ inositol transport protein was localized to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ as described previously . merging green and red _METHOD_ of _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ respectively clearly showed that is associated to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . when isolating the cdna clone of we not only found the long form but also recovered the truncated missing the additional c terminal arm repeat domain . whereas _METHOD_ was also associated to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ was not localized to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ but to the cytoplasm . masking the n terminus of os by _METHOD_ again resulted in patchy distribution at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . indeed rice _PROTEIN_ type pub arm proteins were associated to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and this localization was dependent on the elongated c terminus carrying the additional arm repeat domain . to test whether _PROTEIN_ type pub arm proteins with additional c terminal arm repeats exist in other plants and in mosses we were aiming to identify pub arm proteins in populus trichocarpa and in the moss physcomitrella patens . for that purpose we used the protein sequences of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ including their elongated c terminus to blast search the respective genomes on the phytozome website . when using this approach to identify pub arm proteins in rice we could re identify all pub arm proteins that were recently published by zeng et al . . we therefore decided to follow this approach on p. trichocarpa and p. patens . in p. trichocarpa and p. patens and pub arm proteins were identified respectively . two multiple sequence alignments were applied for bayesian phylogenetic analyses . the first alignment covered amino acid positions and included the full length proteins . in the second alignment all gaps were removed resulting in positions . both alignments gave very similar trees which recovered the classes i iv of pub arm proteins as defined by zeng et al . . _PROTEIN_ and saul like paralogs of arabidopsis and rice are members of class iv . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are closely related and form a common branch with three pub arm proteins from rice and two from poplar . _PROTEIN_ is on a different branch within class iv and is related to rice and as well as two proteins of poplar . six proteins of the bryophyte p. patens are related to the clade of _PROTEIN_ like proteins of the vascular plants . in addition five proteins from p. trichocarpa and five from p. patens form a distinct clade within class iv which is more distantly related to _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ orthologs within the class iv proteins displayed sequences identities of more than . comparison of _PROTEIN_ with class i iii pub arm proteins revealed low identity scores of less than . in all cases and in contrast to all other pub arm proteins _PROTEIN_ type pub arm proteins consist of a clearly higher number of amino acids due to their specific domain organization namely their elongated c terminus that contains additional arm repeat domains . based on these criteria additional blast searches identified putative _PROTEIN_ type pub arm proteins in all land plants listed on the phytozome website suggesting conservation in land plants . phylogenetic relationship of pub arm proteins of arabidopsis rice poplar and moss . simplified bayesian phylogenetic tree depicting the relationship among

cells analyzed localization of _METHOD_ fusion proteins . the poplar _PROTEIN_ type pub arm protein localized to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ as indicated by _METHOD_ _METHOD_ of _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ fusion proteins . in contrast the same approach showed that the poplar pub arm protein that is lacking the c terminal arm repeat domain was localized to cytoplasm and _LOCATION_ . the same results were obtained in physcomitrella patens . whereas fusion proteins with the _PROTEIN_ type pub arm protein were associated with the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ the protein that also does not contain the additional arm repeat domain localized to cytoplasm and _LOCATION_ . to confirm localization of and at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ both _METHOD_ fusion proteins were co _PROTEIN_ with the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ sugar transport protein _METHOD_ from the phytopathogenic fungus ustilago maydis fused to _METHOD_ . the _METHOD_ transport protein was localized to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ as described
