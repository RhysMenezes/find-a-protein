auxin plays a pivotal role in plant development by modulating the activity of scf ubiquitin ligase complexes . here we positionally cloned arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ a mutation that causes leaf hyponasty and reduces leaf venation pattern complexity and auxin responsiveness . we found that _PROTEIN_ is a novel recessive allele of auxin _PROTEIN_ which encodes an invariable component of the scf complex . consistent with a role for auxin in vascular specification the vascular defects in the _PROTEIN_ mutant were accompanied by reduced _PROTEIN_ of auxin transport and auxin perception markers in provascular cells . this observation is consistent with the _PROTEIN_ pattern of _PROTEIN_ which we found to be restricted to vascular precursors and hydathodes in wild type leaf primordia . _PROTEIN_ related to _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and cullin associated _PROTEIN_ participate in the covalent modification of by related to ubiquitin . hypomorphic alleles of these genes also display simple venation patterns and their double mutant combinations with _PROTEIN_ exhibited a synergistic rootless phenotype reminiscent of that caused by loss of function of monopteros _PROTEIN_ which _METHOD_ an auxin signaling module with bodenlos _PROTEIN_ . the phenotypes of double mutant combinations of _PROTEIN_ with either a gain of function allele of _PROTEIN_ or a loss of function allele of _PROTEIN_ were synergistic . in addition a _PROTEIN_ green _METHOD_ protein fusion protein accumulated in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ loss of function or _PROTEIN_ overexpression suppressed the phenotype of _PROTEIN_ . our results demonstrate that the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ module is required not only for root specification in embryogenesis and vascular postembryonic development but also for leaf flatness .
for positional cloning of the recessive _PROTEIN_ mutation a mapping population of phenotypically mutant plants derived from an _PROTEIN_ landsberg _LOCATION_ cross was used for linkage analysis as described previously . the oligonucleotides used for simple sequence length polymorphism marker scoring are listed in supplemental table . the _PROTEIN_ mutation mapped to a kb interval on top of chromosome encompassing annotated genes one of which was _PROTEIN_ . we sequenced the _PROTEIN_ transcription unit in the _PROTEIN_ mutant and its corresponding wild type enkheim finding in exon a transition that creates a new splicing donor site as confirmed by comparison of the sequences of pcr amplification products obtained from en and _PROTEIN_ complementary dnas . two different _PROTEIN_ splice variants are present in _PROTEIN_ seedlings one variant differs from the wild type en mrna only in a silent point mutation but the other variant lacks the last five nucleotides of the exon as a consequence of the new splicing donor site introduced by the mutation . translation of the latter mrna is predicted to produce a truncated protein product whereas the _PROTEIN_ wild type protein includes amino acids the mutant protein is predicted to contain only of which at its c terminus are different from those of the wild type . to quantify the relative levels of the two splice variants produced by the _PROTEIN_ allele we performed quantitative reverse transcription pcr amplifications using two primer pairs one primer pair amplifies a cdna region upstream of the _PROTEIN_ mutation that is shared by both splice variants and the other primer pair amplifies only the long splice variant . our results indicated that _PROTEIN_ mrna levels in en are more than twice those in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . also only of the _PROTEIN_ mrna in the _PROTEIN_ mutant corresponded to the longer splice variant which can be assumed to be functionally wild type . taken together these results indicate that the amount of mrna than can be translated into wild type _PROTEIN_ proteins in _PROTEIN_ is of that seen in the wild type en . as we could not exclude translation of the short aberrant splice variant of _PROTEIN_ we tried to detect its predicted truncated protein product by western blotting using the available anti _PROTEIN_ antibody . although we could not detect any band with the size predicted for the truncated protein we confirmed that both wild type inactive _PROTEIN_ and wild type rubylated _PROTEIN_ protein species were strongly _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ seedling extracts compared with the wild type . the enhancer of _PROTEIN_ auxin resistance recessive allele of _PROTEIN_ carries a missense mutation . both and _PROTEIN_ caused mild leaf hyponasty . transverse sections of first node vegetative leaves indicated that _PROTEIN_ leaves contained smaller adaxial pavement cells more densely packed palisade mesophyll cells and fewer air spaces in the spongy mesophyll than wild type en . more vegetative leaves were produced by _PROTEIN_ than en despite bolting occurring earlier in _PROTEIN_ than in en . flowering _METHOD_ were much shorter in _PROTEIN_ and mutants than in their respective wild types and also displayed reduced apical dominance at das _PROTEIN_ plants exhibited more flowering _METHOD_ than en . similar results were obtained for compared with columbia . we found that the complexity of the vascular network was reduced in _PROTEIN_ and first and third node leaves compared with their wild types . third fourth and higher order veins were missing from _PROTEIN_ and venation patterns in these leaves . the venation density and number of branching points per millimeter squared which are indicators of vascular complexity were reduced in both _PROTEIN_ and and the number of free ending veins per mm of venation length was significantly increased only in _PROTEIN_ . all values are means from first node leaf measurements sd . numbers in boldface indicate significantly different values of the single mutants compared with their wild types or of the double mutants compared with their parental single mutants . for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ values in boldface are significantly different from those of _PROTEIN_ . we also tested the auxin responses of _PROTEIN_ and . seedlings of these mutants displayed reduced inhibition of primary root growth when treated with exogenous iaa and displayed a small increase in the number of _PROTEIN_ roots after the transfer of mutant seedlings to iaa supplemented plates . we confirmed this reduction in auxin responses by examining the _PROTEIN_ of the _METHOD_ reporter in primary root _METHOD_ . _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ and roots in contrast to _PROTEIN_ in the wild type was restricted to the distal region of the meristem and excluded from the vasculature . these results are consistent with a reduction in auxin responses in the _PROTEIN_ and mutants a reduction that can be explained by impaired function . twelve mutations of _PROTEIN_ have already been described including loss and gain of function alleles . to study their phenotypes in combination with _PROTEIN_ we selected four mutants a semidominant gain of function allele _PROTEIN_ and three recessive alleles two of which are null _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and one that is likely hypomorphic . we studied the embryo and seedling phenotypes of plants heterozygous for all possible combinations of these five alleles of _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ heterozygotes were indistinguishable from their _PROTEIN_ parent except for their increased size which is due to heterosis caused by their hybrid en background . seedlings heterozygous for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ lacked their basal region including most of the hypocotyl and primary root and died at postembryonic stages . these three heterozygotes strongly resembled homozygous _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mp or bdl mutants . however combinations of with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ developed roots and were fertile when grown in petri dishes . taken together our results indicate that the recessive _PROTEIN_ mutation causes a stronger loss of function in _PROTEIN_ than the mutation . to study the phenotypes of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ heterozygotes siliques from several _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ crosses were collected before dehiscence and manually dissected . in out of siliques one quarter of the seeds were abortive . differential interference contrast microscopy revealed that the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ embryos were in most cases arrested at the _PROTEIN_ globular stage exhibiting several layers of cells within the suspensor . previous analysis of _PROTEIN_ indicated that it played a role in auxin signaling . to assess the role of _PROTEIN_ and auxin signaling in vascular fate specification and in the mutant phenotype of _PROTEIN_ we examined the _PROTEIN_ of markers for auxin transport _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ auxin perception _METHOD_ and vascular differentiation _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ encodes the only _PROTEIN_ family auxin efflux carrier that is _PROTEIN_ early in leaf preprocambial cells and whose _PROTEIN_ is auxin dependent . we used the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ marker to visualize auxin transport during early development of the leaf venation pattern . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was lower in _PROTEIN_ than in wild type en primordia at das . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in leaf primordia was detected at das in the preprocambial cells of more than three vascular loops in en and in only one or two vascular loops including the midvein in _PROTEIN_ . the differences in _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ between en and _PROTEIN_ were enhanced _PROTEIN_ in leaf primordium development . both en and _PROTEIN_ seedlings treated with the auxin efflux inhibitor n naphthylphthalamic acid displayed increased leaf vein densities which correlates with an enhanced _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . however the venation patterns of _PROTEIN_ leaf primordia treated with npa were always less complex than those of the wild type . in contrast to _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ the _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ was initially indistinguishable in _PROTEIN_ and en and was restricted to the apex of leaf primordia at das . however from to das _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ broadened in the wild type but expanded much less in _PROTEIN_ . consistent with _PROTEIN_ auxin signaling in _PROTEIN_ leaves _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was substantially reduced in the quiescent center and the columella region of _PROTEIN_ root _METHOD_ at das . npa treatment increased vein densities and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in en and _PROTEIN_ but the _PROTEIN_ venation pattern was much simpler . _PROTEIN_ encodes an _PROTEIN_ inducible hd zip iii transcription _PROTEIN_ that restricts preprocambial cell fate specification downstream of auxin . _PROTEIN_ gus _PROTEIN_ was similar in the central region of leaf primordia of en and _PROTEIN_ at das and more complex in en than in _PROTEIN_ from das onward . in leaf primordia the _PROTEIN_ patterns of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ gus were similar to those in _PROTEIN_ . taken together our results indicate that a loss of function mutation in _PROTEIN_ such as the _PROTEIN_ and mutations alters vascular development beginning at the earliest stages of auxin perception and transport and extending to the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ of specific vascular differentiation genes . to examine _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ an _PROTEIN_ gus transcriptional fusion was obtained and transferred into plants . two independent transgenic families in the col background and five in the en background exhibited similar _PROTEIN_ patterns . _PROTEIN_ was broadly _PROTEIN_ during embryogenesis from the cell dermatogen to the early torpedo stages and remained ubiquitous in both the embryo and the suspensor . from the torpedo stage onward strong gus staining was associated with provascular tissues and the shoot apical meristem . during postembryonic development _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was high in the shoot and root apical _METHOD_ vascular associated cells and cotyledon and leaf hydathodes . in the flowers _PROTEIN_ gus was _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in the vasculature mature stigmas ovules and mature pollen grains . we also examined _PROTEIN_ gus _PROTEIN_ during the early development of the first pair of leaves from to das in phenotypically mutant and wild type siblings from several families segregating for the _PROTEIN_ mutation . the initially broad _PROTEIN_ gus _PROTEIN_ in leaf primordia was rapidly restricted to vascular associated cells and hydathodes . npa treatment of either wild type or _PROTEIN_ seedlings increased vein density which was correlated with an increase in the _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ gus marker in their leaves . to study _PROTEIN_ protein distribution and subcellular localization we used an _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion _PROTEIN_ under the control of the _PROTEIN_ promoter . we obtained two families in the col background and four in the en background all of them _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ construct . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was detected early in embryogenesis from the dermatogen stage onward . the pattern of early embryonic _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was ubiquitous similar to that seen for _PROTEIN_ gus . however increased _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signal was detected in provascular tissues from the heart stage onward . postembryonic _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was strong in the division zone of the root meristem with both _LOCATION_ and cytoplasmic subcellular localization as described previously for the _PROTEIN_ protein . in the root differentiation zone _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was detected only in pericycle cells . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was broadly _PROTEIN_ in young leaf primordia but in mature cotyledons and leaves it was restricted to vascular associated cells and some cells within the hydathodes . we also performed a time series analysis of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ localization during leaf development . in contrast to other auxin signaling or vascular _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ markers specific procambial _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was not seen in leaf primordia earlier than das . as leaf development proceeded _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was restricted to vascular tissues . in addition we obtained similar npa dependent patterns of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ to those previously found for _PROTEIN_ gus . to investigate whether the precise regulation of scf function is essential for leaf development and vein patterning we examined the interaction of _PROTEIN_ with mutations affecting genes that regulate the covalent modification of _PROTEIN_ by rub . we obtained double mutant combinations of either _PROTEIN_ or with _PROTEIN_ hve _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ loss of function mutations that affect rub modification of _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ and hve mutants display reduced venation pattern complexity and leaf size compared with their wild type counterparts . we found a transfer dna insertion in the first intron of _PROTEIN_ that reduced its _PROTEIN_ to of the wild type level and we named this allele _PROTEIN_ . leaves of homozygous _PROTEIN_ plants were slightly hyponastic and normally sized but they exhibited reduced venation density and number of branching points veins per millimeter squared . leaves of the _PROTEIN_ mutant were of reduced size but with a venation density and number of branching points per millimeter squared similar to those of col . the number of free ending veins per venation length however was significantly _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ mutant leaves compared with those of col . all the double mutant combinations of _PROTEIN_ hve _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ or shared a seedling lethal phenotype that we interpreted as synergistic . these double mutants strongly resembled homozygous _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mp or bdl single mutants with a lack of roots and hypocotyls strong defects in vein differentiation and only incipient leaf development . since this more than additive phenotype showed variable _PROTEIN_ we classified the embryo lethal double mutants into five phenotypic classes from strong to weak . however no clear pattern emerged from our phenotypic classification that would allow us to make conclusions on differences in the strength of the genetic interactions found . we further dissected siliques from plants that were homozygous for _PROTEIN_ and heterozygous for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or hve and vice versa . all double mutant embryos for all four genetic combinations displayed failures in the division of the hypophysis and hypophysis derived cells giving rise to embryonic phenotypes similar to those previously observed in homozygotes for loss of function mp or gain of function bdl and _PROTEIN_ mutations . the most extreme double mutant phenotypes that we found were in some cases more severe than those usually observed in mp bdl _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ homozygotes . in summary we found genetic interactions between loss of function alleles of _PROTEIN_ and four genes required to regulate scf activity by the rubylation derubylation pathway suggesting that both activation and inhibition of _PROTEIN_ by rub attachment and release respectively are essential for proper scf function . the _PROTEIN_ role of the complex is the ubiquitin mediated destabilization of aux/iaa repressors which are negative regulators of auxin signaling . we next examined the interaction of _PROTEIN_ and with hypermorphic alleles of aux/iaa genes such as the dominant _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ or the semidominant _PROTEIN_ and alleles . all plants of the eight double mutant genotypes analyzed were dwarfed and exhibited compact rosettes with leaves of reduced size and increased hyponasty compared with their single mutant siblings phenotypes that we interpreted as additive . leaves of the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants were reduced in size but their vascular phenotypes were similar to the wild type the only exception being an increased number of free ending veins per mm of venation . the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ double mutants displayed additive venation phenotypes as we found a significant reduction in their leaf area and intermediate values in vascular complexity traits compared with those seen in both single mutants alone . all the double mutant combinations including a loss of function allele of _PROTEIN_ and a gain of function allele of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ were viable and fertile in contrast to the interactions that we observed between loss of function alleles of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ . as we mentioned in the introduction seedlings homozygous for bdl a semidominant gain of function allele of _PROTEIN_ do not develop basal structures due to defective early hypophysis specification a phenotype that is similar to that caused by strong loss of function alleles of _PROTEIN_ . we found this phenotype to be reminiscent of that caused by strong loss of scf function either directly _PROTEIN_ or indirectly . in our standard growth conditions bdl/bdl heterozygotes displayed a leaf incurvature similar to that seen in _PROTEIN_ and homozygotes . in light of our finding that _PROTEIN_ and do not interact with gain of function alleles of some aux/iaa genes the dose dependent phenotype of the bdl allele suggested to us that the leaf and vascular phenotypes of _PROTEIN_ and primarily arise from the stabilization of _PROTEIN_ whose levels are known to be precisely titrated during embryogenesis for proper specification of embryonic basal structures . in several families derived from selfed _PROTEIN_ bdl/bdl and _PROTEIN_ bdl/bdl plants we found more rootless early lethal seedlings than expected a significant proportion of which were heterozygous for the bdl mutation and homozygous for either _PROTEIN_ or . about one quarter of the seeds studied did not germinate and as no double mutant was found among the germinated seedlings we hypothesize that _PROTEIN_ bdl and bdl double homozygotes might have an embryo lethal phenotype . we then dissected siliques from _PROTEIN_ bdl/bdl and _PROTEIN_ bdl/bdl selfed plants to visualize the embryonic phenotypes of the offspring by dic microscopy . in all cases wild type embryos were found in siliques from homozygous _PROTEIN_ and plants as expected since these mutations do not alter the root initiation program during embryogenesis . moreover whereas bdl/bdl embryos only display weak phenotypes derived from hypophysis misspecification putative _PROTEIN_ bdl double homozygote embryos show more severe defects such as apparently twin embryos or embryos displaying strong division defects and overproliferation in the suspensor . similar embryo lethal phenotypes were found in the progeny of _PROTEIN_ bdl/bdl selfed plants . _PROTEIN_ is known to interact with and inhibit the _PROTEIN_ transcription _PROTEIN_ which is required for basal patterning of embryos and vascular development . to confirm that the genetic interaction found between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ is mediated by _PROTEIN_ we crossed the weak mp allele to _PROTEIN_ or . as described previously only to of the progeny from _PROTEIN_ plants were rootless due to incomplete penetrance . several families obtained by selfing _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ plants included a number of rootless seedlings lower than that of the expected double mutants . to unequivocally identify the _PROTEIN_ mp and mp double mutant phenotypes we quantified the number of abortive seeds in the siliques of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ plants . we then determined the embryonic phenotypes by dic microscopy . we found abnormal cell divisions in the hypophysis and hypophysis derived cells in homozygous mp embryos as described previously . all the abortive seeds contained dead embryos with mutant phenotypes of different degrees of severity some of which are shown in figure o to q . we reasoned that the _PROTEIN_ phenotype might be caused by the inactivation of _PROTEIN_ caused by the stabilization of its aux/iaa repressor _PROTEIN_ as a consequence of partial inactivation of the complex . to test our hypothesis we obtained _PROTEIN_ and nine en transgenic lines _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ construct which were used to study _PROTEIN_ stabilization . we found faint _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein in the central region of primary roots in young en seedlings which is indicative of rapid protein turnover via proteasome degradation . consistent with a reduced function of in the _PROTEIN_ mutants we found an accumulation of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in the vascular domain of the root meristem in _PROTEIN_ plants . to confirm that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ accumulation in _PROTEIN_ is earlier and independent of proteasome function we incubated young seedlings in the presence of a proteasome inhibitor . we found that a short treatment increased the accumulation of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in wild type roots whereas no significant differences were found between _PROTEIN_ roots treated or not with . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was found _PROTEIN_ in the _LOCATION_ of abaxial pavement cells of cleared _PROTEIN_ leaf primordia whereas no _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signal was found in wild type leaves . we discarded the idea that the stronger signal of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was caused by overexpression of the _PROTEIN_ gene in the _PROTEIN_ background by quantifying _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . these results are consistent with the hypothesis that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ accumulates in the _PROTEIN_ mutant due to a defective function which is upstream of proteasomal degradation . taken together the genetic interactions found between _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ suggest that the regulatory pathway involving these three genes is _PROTEIN_ responsible for the specification of embryonic basal structures and for the specification of postembryonic vascular tissues and that tight regulation of _PROTEIN_ activity through auxin mediated scf regulation is required . to investigate if the phenotype of _PROTEIN_ depends on the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ module we assessed to what extent it can be modified by _PROTEIN_ overexpression and obtained independent lines carrying the _PROTEIN_ transgene in the _PROTEIN_ and en backgrounds . in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ families we observed segregation for a mild leaf hyponasty phenotype clearly distinguishable from that of the _PROTEIN_ homozygotes . in all cases plants with this phenotype were _PROTEIN_ and carried the _PROTEIN_ construct likely as homozygotes . we confirmed further this partial rescue in _PROTEIN_ families that exhibited a mild leaf incurvature and found that all were transgenic for the _PROTEIN_ construct and homozygous for the _PROTEIN_ mutation . as _PROTEIN_ accumulated to higher levels in _PROTEIN_ we hypothesized that a stronger phenotypic suppression might be achieved with a lack of function allele of _PROTEIN_ . we crossed _PROTEIN_ and to the _PROTEIN_ mutant which bears a t dna insertion in the second exon of _PROTEIN_ abolishing its _PROTEIN_ . in the progeny the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutants exhibited only weak leaf hyponasty likely as a consequence of suppression of the phenotype of _PROTEIN_ by the lack of function of _PROTEIN_ . this observation was confirmed by genotyping in the progeny of selfed _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plants . similar results were obtained in the and generations derived from an _PROTEIN_ cross . taken together our results suggest that the leaf incurvature of _PROTEIN_ is caused by the loss of _PROTEIN_ activity due to the accumulation of its repressor _PROTEIN_ . we quantified the partial suppression carried out by the _PROTEIN_ transgene and the _PROTEIN_ null mutant over some _PROTEIN_ phenotypes . the number of _PROTEIN_ roots was significantly higher in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutants . _PROTEIN_ auxin responsiveness both _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were more sensitive to endogenous auxin than _PROTEIN_ but less than the wild type . although _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ leaf size was similar to that of col the venation density of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ leaves was not significantly different from _PROTEIN_ . the number of free ending veins per venation length however was significantly lower in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ leaves than in _PROTEIN_ . while in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutants leaf size was not rescued their vein phenotypes were significantly different from those of _PROTEIN_ and more similar to those of their wild type . taken together both _PROTEIN_ overexpression and a null allele of _PROTEIN_ restore most of the phenotypic defects caused by the _PROTEIN_ mutation suggesting that the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ module is responsible for some of the _PROTEIN_ phenotypes studied .

effects of npa seedlings were grown on standard plates containing or npa . a single colon is used to indicate promoter coding sequence fusions and fusions of coding sequences . for the sake of clarity a single colon indicates that a gene is driven by its native promoter . to construct the _PROTEIN_ gus transgene a kb segment from the upstream region of the start codon of the _PROTEIN_ gene was pcr amplified from col genomic dna with phusion high fidelity dna polymerase . the pcr product obtained was purified with the illustra gfx pcr dna and gel band purification kit and then cloned into the pgem t vector using the _PROTEIN_ clonase ii kit as indicated by the manufacturer . chemically competent escherichia coli cells were transformed by the heat shock method and the orientation and structural integrity of the inserts carried by the transformants isolated were verified by sequencing . the target sequences were transferred via an lr clonase ii reaction to the gateway compatible destination vector containing the gusa gene . for the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgenes and kb segments of the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ genes respectively were amplified from col genomic dna cloned into pgem t and subcloned into which harbors an in frame version of the _METHOD_ gene using the gateway technology as described above . all these constructs were mobilized into agrobacterium tumefaciens cells which were used to infect en _PROTEIN_ col and plants by the floral dip method . transgenic plants were selected on plates supplemented with hygromycin b . for the _PROTEIN_ construct a. tumefaciens cells were transformed with plasmid dna and the transformants were used to infect en and _PROTEIN_ plants . seeds were sown on river sand watered with a mg solution of _PROTEIN_ as described by citation . primers used in the pcr amplifications performed to obtain the _PROTEIN_ gus _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ constructs are described in supplemental table together with those used to genotype antibiotic and herbicide resistant plants . for root growth studies root images were obtained with a flatbed scanner . root length was digitally measured with the nis elements ar image analysis package . flowering time was scored by counting the number of _PROTEIN_ and en plants that had a visible flowering stem at to das

leaf section micrographs were taken as described by citation . venation morphometry was performed on _METHOD_ that were obtained from micrographs of cleared first node leaves per genotype as described previously . all data were analyzed using the statistical package for the social sciences software and their normality was assessed by kolmogorov smirnov tests with lilliefors correction . when the data fitted a normal distribution student s t tests were used to compare mean values otherwise the nonparametric mann whitney u test was used instead . confocal laser scanning microscopy _PROTEIN_ images were obtained digitally and processed using the operation software ez for a nikon confocal microscope . _METHOD_ was excited at nm with an argon ion laser and its emission was analyzed between and nm . to visualize _METHOD_ from embryos and leaf primordia chlorophyll was solubilized by incubating seedlings in methanol acetone for min at and then transferring the samples to phosphate buffer ph prior to confocal microscopy . to avoid nonspecific _METHOD_ in the green channel in some cases we also excited at nm with a helium neon laser and analyzed the emission between and nm recording the nonspecific _METHOD_ in red . for _PROTEIN_ micrographs of roots we stained seedlings with a solution of propidium iodide which visualizes cell walls in the red channel . to confirm the _LOCATION_ localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ we stained seedlings with a solution of diamidino phenylindole dihydrochloride for min washed them extensively with water and further excited them at nm with a modulated diode laser . all images from a given _METHOD_ marker at a defined time point were taken using the same _PROTEIN_ settings . for comparison of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ from _PROTEIN_ and wild type seedlings we used or siblings unless otherwise stated . to quantify _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ levels d old seedlings from three en and three _PROTEIN_ families carrying the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgene were transferred to liquid _METHOD_ medium supplemented with a proteasome inhibitor or dimethyl sulfoxide . after h of incubation under standard experimental conditions seedlings were washed three times for min with liquid _METHOD_ medium to remove residual dimethyl sulfoxide or . _PROTEIN_ images were then taken from propidium iodide stained roots and processed using imagej as follows . first the green channel of each _PROTEIN_ image was converted to eight bit format images using a defined threshold . then we selected an equivalent region of interest for each image as a line drawn in the center of the root that extends from the quiescent center up to the elongation zone . a plot profile of the gray values along this line was recorded for each image which positively correlates with the _METHOD_ intensity as described by citation . arbitrary units were converted to percentages of _METHOD_ intensity defining the value as the mean of _PROTEIN_ values . _METHOD_ intensity data were analyzed using spss by applying kolmogorov smirnov tests with lilliefors correction and student s t tests were used to compare mean values . protein samples were

adding of each protein extract using the mini protean cell kit . electrotransfer to nitrocellulose _LOCATION_ was performed as described in the mini trans blot electrophoretic transfer cell manual . we used anti _PROTEIN_ at a dilution as a primary antibody and anti _PROTEIN_ at a dilution as a loading control . a goat anti rabbit igg antibody with conjugated horseradish peroxidase was used as a secondary antibody which was detected with the immun star hrp chemiluminescent kit as described by the manufacturer and lumi film chemiluminescent detection _METHOD_ . total rna was extracted from to mg of rosette tissue collected das using the citric acid method . cdna was reverse transcribed using maxima reverse transcriptase . either power sybr green pcr master mix or maxima sybr green qpcr master mix kits were used as indicated in the manufacturers instructions . at least one oligonucleotide in each primer pair was designed to span the ends of two adjacent exons so that genomic dna would not be amplified . relative quantification of gene _PROTEIN_ data was performed using the comparative threshold cycle method . each reaction was made using three biological replicates each with three technical replicates the _PROTEIN_ levels were normalized to the cycle threshold values obtained for the housekeeping gene _PROTEIN_ . double mutant phenotypes caused by the combination of recessive mutations in two genes were independently confirmed in several families derived from selfed plants exhibiting the phenotype of one of the single mutant parents . in some cases the putatively double mutant seedlings were genotyped to confirm that they were double homozygotes using the oligonucleotides shown in supplemental table . genetic interactions of _PROTEIN_ with dominant or semidominant mutations in aux/iaa genes were analyzed in plants three of of which exhibited the double mutant phenotype . to exclude phenotypes dependent on the genetic background all the genetic interactions of _PROTEIN_ were also assayed in parallel with . the statistic was used to calculate two tailed p values to test whether the observed phenotypic ratios fit expected segregations . the
