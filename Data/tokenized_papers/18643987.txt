ubiquitination plays important roles in plant development including programmed cell death . here we characterize a novel _LOCATION_ bound _PROTEIN_ motif protein encoded by _PROTEIN_ that is _PROTEIN_ at a low level in all arabidopsis tissues but can be upregulated by fumonisin _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ treatment and pathogen infection . _PROTEIN_ displays ubiquitin ligase activity in vitro which is dependent on the integrity of the _PROTEIN_ motif . _METHOD_ fusion protein localization and cell fractionation experiments show that this ligase is associated with the lipid rafts of _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . knock down of _PROTEIN_ transcripts using artificial microrna _PROTEIN_ leads to _PROTEIN_ hyposensitivity but overexpression of _PROTEIN_ confers hypersensitivity . additionally _PROTEIN_ of the pathogenesis related gene is lower and delayed in amir _PROTEIN_ plants compared with wild type and _PROTEIN_ overexpressing plants . the _PROTEIN_ hyposensitivity of amir _PROTEIN_ plants can be rescued by _PROTEIN_ of cleavage resistant _PROTEIN_ transcripts . our results suggest that _PROTEIN_ acts as a signal from the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ lipid rafts to trigger the _PROTEIN_ induced plant programmed cell death pathway .
to identify arabidopsis ligase genes induced by stress in silico gene _PROTEIN_ of previously generated genome wide microarray data was analyzed . preliminary microarray data indicated that _PROTEIN_ of a novel _PROTEIN_ motif type ubiquitin ligase gene _PROTEIN_ was highly induced in response to the fungal toxin _PROTEIN_ . the accumulation of _PROTEIN_ transcripts in response to _PROTEIN_ was confirmed by northern blot analysis . in addition _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was highly induced by pst avr _PROTEIN_ pathogen infection . these results suggested that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is induced in response to biotic stress . to investigate the _PROTEIN_ pattern of _PROTEIN_ in specific plant tissues and in response to various stresses we generated an arabidopsis transgenic line _PROTEIN_ a _PROTEIN_ promoter gus reporter gene . histochemical gus staining of several tissues from adult _PROTEIN_ promoter gus transgenic plants was performed in the absence of stress and in response to various stresses . we observed a low level of gus _PROTEIN_ in vegetative tissues of non stressed adult plants such as cotyledons leaves and root tips . however gus _PROTEIN_ was highly induced in leaves and petioles after _PROTEIN_ treatment compared with mock treatment . furthermore gus _PROTEIN_ was high in regions surrounding cell death lesions on leaves of _PROTEIN_ treated seedlings . we also examined gus _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ promoter gus transgenic plants in response to infection by bacterial pathogens . gus staining was detected in regions surrounding lesions that appeared after pst avr _PROTEIN_ inoculation on plant leaves . these results suggested that _PROTEIN_ is also involved in plant pathogen interaction . the _PROTEIN_ locus is located on chromosome of the arabidopsis genome . the coding sequence contains bp without any introns . a protein of amino acid residues with an estimated molecular _METHOD_ of kda was predicted from the coding region . amino acid sequence alignments predicted a transmembrane region at the n terminus of _PROTEIN_ and a _PROTEIN_ motif in the central region of the protein . this _PROTEIN_ motif contains a conserved type _PROTEIN_ domain . based on previous work showing that proteins containing _PROTEIN_ motifs can function as ligases in vitro we tested whether _PROTEIN_ also had ligase activity . a maltose binding protein _PROTEIN_ fusion _PROTEIN_ was affinity purified and its putative ubiquitin ligase activity was assayed in vitro . western blot analysis showed that purified mbp _PROTEIN_ was auto ubiquitinated and this reaction was dependent on and . control experiments showed that mbp alone was inactive . it has been shown that the _PROTEIN_ motif of _PROTEIN_ finger proteins is essential for ligase activity . we produced a mutant protein _PROTEIN_ in which the _PROTEIN_ motif was altered by changing _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ to serine residues . in vitro ubiquitination assays showed that _PROTEIN_ was inactive indicating that an intact _PROTEIN_ motif is essential for its activity . the predicted structure of _PROTEIN_ included a transmembrane domain at the n terminus of the protein between amino acids and suggesting its localization in cell _LOCATION_ . to determine the cellular localization of _PROTEIN_ we constructed a _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion gene and monitored _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ in agrobacterium infiltrated nicotiana tabacum leaves . no _METHOD_ signal was detected on epidermal cells of tobacco leaves . one possible explanation could be the instability of _PROTEIN_ which could undergo auto ubiquitination and self destruction . to circumvent this problem we constructed an inactive mutant _PROTEIN_ and monitored _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ in agrobacterium infiltrated n. tabacum leaves . figure shows that the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein is localized to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . most importantly no _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was seen in the _LOCATION_ or cytoplasmic strands but _METHOD_ was detected in _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and cytoplasmic strands of the _METHOD_ control . _METHOD_ staining of _LOCATION_ structures and black hollows that represent organelles was observed in the cytoplasm . the detection of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein with compromised ligase activity suggested that the wild type _PROTEIN_ is likely to be unstable . to confirm the localization of _PROTEIN_ in _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ the arabidopsis _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ fraction was highly purified by differential centrifugation and aqueous two phase partition from _PROTEIN_ plants induced with estradiol . western blot analysis showed that _PROTEIN_ protein was highly enriched in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ fraction . plant _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ is not homogeneous and sub domains called lipid rafts have been suggested to be involved in signaling events . accordingly we further isolated lipid rafts from the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ fraction making use of their detergent insolubility at low temperature and low buoyant density on sucrose flotation gradients . figure shows that the _PROTEIN_ protein was indeed highly enriched in the lipid raft fraction . in addition a second _PROTEIN_ related band of higher molecular weight was seen which was probably a ubiquitinated form of _PROTEIN_ . from these data we conclude that _PROTEIN_ may be an unstable protein located in the lipid raft domain of arabidopsis _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . ubiquitination has been shown to target proteins for degradation through the proteasome pathway . the auto ubiquitination activity of _PROTEIN_ protein together with its cellular accumulation after disruption of its ligase activity suggested that this protein may be unstable under normal conditions . to further investigate the stability of _PROTEIN_ in vivo we generated transgenic plants overexpressing _PROTEIN_ protein tagged with or . the transgenic lines produced did not show any obvious phenotypic differences from wild type plants . seedlings overexpressing _PROTEIN_ were treated with cycloheximide to block new protein synthesis and _PROTEIN_ levels were measured over time to determine its half life . _PROTEIN_ rapidly disappeared min after inhibition of protein synthesis but accumulated under normal conditions in the same transgenic plants . the rapid disappearance of _PROTEIN_ was probably due to degradation by proteasomes as it can be halted by treatment . in the presence of ubiquitinated _METHOD_ of _PROTEIN_ were also detected . interestingly the half life of _PROTEIN_ was dramatically increased in the presence of _PROTEIN_ . the effect was specific because _PROTEIN_ did not affect the half life of phy b or _PROTEIN_ proteins . these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ protein is unstable under normal conditions but may be stabilized in response to stress conditions particularly during plant pcd triggered by _PROTEIN_ treatment . to determine whether auto ubiquitination of _PROTEIN_ was responsible for its rapid degradation we compared the half life of wild type _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutant proteins in vivo . the mutant protein half life was increased from to h relative to that of wild type _PROTEIN_ . like wild type _PROTEIN_ wild type _PROTEIN_ also showed a half life of min confirming that the tag indeed had no influence on protein stability . this result suggests that _PROTEIN_ stability is in part self regulated in vivo through its _PROTEIN_ motif however other ligases are also involved in its turnover . to study the role of _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis we searched for _PROTEIN_ knock out lines . however no suitable t dna insertion line for _PROTEIN_ was available amongst existing t dna mutant collections . we therefore generated _PROTEIN_ knock down transgenic lines by cleavage of _PROTEIN_ transcripts using artificial mirnas . we used oligonucleotide directed mutagenesis to alter the nt sequence of _PROTEIN_ to the synthetic sequence uaugauugagccgacgacgca _PROTEIN_ directed against nucleotides of the _PROTEIN_ mrna . a high _PROTEIN_ level of amir _PROTEIN_ was obtained in selected transgenic lines . northern blot analysis confirmed that these amir _PROTEIN_ lines displayed downregulation of _PROTEIN_ mrna even in the presence of _PROTEIN_ . we also generated a mutated form of the _PROTEIN_ gene _PROTEIN_ whose amir _PROTEIN_ target sequences were altered to introduce mismatch pairing with amir _PROTEIN_ . because of the nucleotide mismatches _PROTEIN_ transcripts should be insensitive to amir _PROTEIN_ mediated cleavage . as the mutated nucleotides of the _PROTEIN_ did not change the encoded amino acids the mutant gene can be used to complement _PROTEIN_ loss of function in amir _PROTEIN_ knock down transgenic lines . we transferred a _PROTEIN_ gene into amir _PROTEIN_ line to obtain a _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double transgenic plant . this double transgenic plant continued to _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ transcripts even in the presence of amir _PROTEIN_ indicating that the _PROTEIN_ transcript was indeed resistant to amir _PROTEIN_ mediated cleavage . moreover _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ protein was detected in this plant demonstrating that the _PROTEIN_ gene can complement the loss of function of _PROTEIN_ in amir _PROTEIN_ plants . neither _PROTEIN_ overexpressing plants _PROTEIN_ nor amir _PROTEIN_ lines showed any obvious phenotype when grown on _METHOD_ medium or on soil . we therefore tested the sensitivity of _PROTEIN_ knock down _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ overexpressing _PROTEIN_ lines to _PROTEIN_ . we arbitrarily classified the response _METHOD_ into three classes according to the severity of the cell death phenotype insensitive sensitive and extremely sensitive . seedling growth of plants displaying the extremely sensitive phenotype was strongly inhibited and new leaf formation was blocked . furthermore we detected macroscopic lesions on leaves that could lead to leaf death . plants with the sensitive phenotype contained macroscopic lesions on leaves and displayed developmental alterations such as asymmetric petioles moreover the seedlings were bigger than those of extremely sensitive plants and new leaf formation was not inhibited . seedlings of the insensitive phenotype grew normally like mock treated plants and no macroscopic lesions were seen . wild type seedlings treated with _PROTEIN_ comprised extremely sensitive and sensitive plants with the remaining seedlings being insensitive to _PROTEIN_ . the proportion of _PROTEIN_ insensitive plants was not significantly different between the two _PROTEIN_ lines and wild type . compared to wild type however these two lines showed a slightly higher proportion of plants in the extremely sensitive category and a corresponding lower proportion of plants in the sensitive category . interestingly in the two amir _PROTEIN_ lines analyzed only of seedlings were extremely sensitive to _PROTEIN_ and were sensitive with > of seedlings being insensitive to _PROTEIN_ . both knock down lines were significant different from wild type for the extremely sensitive and insensitive categories . these results indicate that reducing the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ level leads to _PROTEIN_ hyposensitivity . to show that the _PROTEIN_ phenotypes of the amir _PROTEIN_ plants were indeed due to reduced _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ we _PROTEIN_ a _PROTEIN_ transgene in the these plants . we found that the _PROTEIN_ hyposensitivity can be converted to hypersensitivity by _PROTEIN_ of cleavage resistant _PROTEIN_ transcripts . in addition we compared pr _PROTEIN_ in amir _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ wild type and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plants treated with _PROTEIN_ for various durations . in wild type plants pr gene _PROTEIN_ was induced after h of _PROTEIN_ treatment and the induction was about fivefold at h. the pr _PROTEIN_ in two _PROTEIN_ lines increased and fold at h respectively upon _PROTEIN_ treatment and this induction was not significantly different from that of wild type . however pr _PROTEIN_ in two amir _PROTEIN_ lines was lower than that of wild type but was restored to wild type level in the complementation line _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . these results indicate that _PROTEIN_ gene _PROTEIN_ promotes pr induction by _PROTEIN_ and implicate _PROTEIN_ in defense responses .

the mature amir _PROTEIN_ reverse complementary sequence . pcr amplification of the _PROTEIN_ precursor using the primers described above and pentr pre _PROTEIN_ which contains the _PROTEIN_ precursor cdna as a template generated a dna fragment that was subsequently digested with bglii and xmai . the bglii xmai fragment was moved into pentr pre _PROTEIN_ to generate pentr pre amir _PROTEIN_ .
