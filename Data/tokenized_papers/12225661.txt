background plant development is exquisitely sensitive to light . seedlings grown in the dark have a developmentally arrested etiolated phenotype whereas in the light they develop leaves and complete their life cycle . arabidopsis de etiolated _PROTEIN_ mutants develop like light grown seedlings even when grown in the dark . _PROTEIN_ encodes a _LOCATION_ protein that appears to act downstream from multiple photoreceptors to regulate morphogenesis and gene _PROTEIN_ in response to light . however its function has remained unknown . results we used microarrays to examine defects in transcription in dark grown _PROTEIN_ seedlings . we found extensive changes in gene _PROTEIN_ including many of the transcriptional responses observed in light treated wild type seedlings . we used an epitope tagging approach to determine the basis of _PROTEIN_ function . _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ rescues the _PROTEIN_ phenotype is localized to the _LOCATION_ and _METHOD_ an approximately kda complex which is required for full _PROTEIN_ activity . we affinity purified the _PROTEIN_ complex and identified an approximately kda copurifying protein that is the plant homolog of uv damaged dna binding protein a protein implicated in the human disease xeroderma pigmentosa . a null mutation in arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ results in no obvious phenotype on its own yet it enhances the phenotype of a weak _PROTEIN_ allele . conclusions _PROTEIN_ and interact both biochemically and genetically . in animal cells interacts with histone acetyltransferase complexes . the _PROTEIN_ complex may regulate gene _PROTEIN_ in response to light via recruitment of hat activity . thus _PROTEIN_ whose sequence is conserved in both animals and plants may play a direct role in the regulation of many genes .
because dark grown _PROTEIN_ seedlings with short hypocotyls and open cotyledons resemble light grown wild type seedlings morphologically we were curious to know to what extent they were similar at the level of gene _PROTEIN_ . using microarrays for this analysis we compared gene _PROTEIN_ in wild type and _PROTEIN_ seedlings that were grown in the dark for days then exposed to white light for or min . the timing of light exposure was based on experiments with wild type seedlings . the time points chosen cause different levels of visible de etiolation when seedlings are returned to the dark and checked for cotyledon opening and greening hr _PROTEIN_ . light exposure for min resulted in no open cotyledons hr _PROTEIN_ . exposure for hr resulted in a mix of seedlings some with but most without a cotyledon opening response . after being given hr of light exposure almost all seedlings showed open and green cotyledons hr _PROTEIN_ . when _PROTEIN_ levels were compared in dark grown wild type and _PROTEIN_ seedlings nearly a thousand genes of the on the microarray were found to be over or under _PROTEIN_ by more than fold in _PROTEIN_ relative to the wild type suggesting that _PROTEIN_ has broad effects on the regulation of transcription . when the transcriptional changes in dark grown _PROTEIN_ were compared with the changes in gene _PROTEIN_ induced by light treatment of the wild type substantial overlap was observed citation . nearly half of the changes in gene _PROTEIN_ induced by light treatment of the wild type occurred in _PROTEIN_ grown in the dark . finally we compared the effects of light treatment on _PROTEIN_ and wild type seedlings citation . we found that the majority of changes in gene _PROTEIN_ induced by light treatment of the wild type no longer occurred in _PROTEIN_ often because these changes already existed in dark grown _PROTEIN_ . among this class of genes that were found to be overexpressed in dark grown _PROTEIN_ as well as induced by light in wild type but not _PROTEIN_ seedlings were several well characterized light regulated genes previously shown to be _PROTEIN_ in dark grown _PROTEIN_ . overall these results support the hypothesis that _PROTEIN_ plays a significant role in the transcriptional response to light . in addition many genes that were overexpressed in dark grown _PROTEIN_ were not induced by light citation and many genes responded to light in _PROTEIN_ but not in the wild type citation . these unique changes could simply be due to differences in timing the _PROTEIN_ seedlings may be effectively behaving like three day old light grown seedlings whereas the wild type were only treated for three hours . alternatively they may reveal a role for _PROTEIN_ in additional transcriptional responses . the _PROTEIN_ sequence is conserved throughout higher eukaryotes . the deduced arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ is identical to its tomato homolog to rice to human and to drosophila citation . _PROTEIN_ mutants have also been identified in tomato citation and drosophila citation . despite the existence of these mutants in multiple species the biochemical function of _PROTEIN_ remains unclear . the only obvious motifs in the primary sequence are a pair of bipartite _LOCATION_ localization signals . using an epitope tagging approach to characterize the _PROTEIN_ protein we attached a green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ tag to the n _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ or c _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ terminus of _PROTEIN_ . these constructs were then used to transform the intermediate _PROTEIN_ allele citation . as shown in citation _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was able to fully rescue the _PROTEIN_ dark phenotype resulting in long hypocotyls and closed cotyledons . in contrast _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was only partially functional it rescued hypocotyl length but not cotyledon opening . we used _METHOD_ microscopy to examine fusion protein localization . _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was found to be predominantly _LOCATION_ whereas _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was detected in both the _LOCATION_ and the cytoplasm _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ citation . the availability of commercial anti _METHOD_ antibodies also allowed us to use _METHOD_ as a biochemical tag . western blots of extracts derived from transgenic plants on standard _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ showed that both proteins were full length with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ appearing to be slightly more stable and of higher mobility than _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ citation . this difference in mobility may be due to a number of _PROTEIN_ including differences in the shape of the two fusion proteins . fractionation of transgenic plant extracts on a gel filtration column followed by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and western blotting showed that _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ is present primarily in an approximately kda complex with some additional higher molecular weight species whereas _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ is primarily in an approximately kda complex citation . in summary _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ resulted in full rescue of _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ localization and approximately kda complex formation whereas _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ resulted in partial rescue partial _LOCATION_ localization and approximately kda complex formation citation . these results suggest that a _LOCATION_ localized approximately kda complex is the functional form of _PROTEIN_ and that the addition of a c terminal _METHOD_ tag interferes with these properties . to further analyze the function of the _PROTEIN_ c terminus we engineered a series of c terminal truncations of and amino acids into the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ construct citation . in addition we also introduced the molecular lesions introduced by two other intermediate _PROTEIN_ alleles _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ citation into _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ to determine the basis of their reduced function . when these five constructs were transformed into _PROTEIN_ only _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ showed any degree of rescue this construct restored hypocotyl length but not cotyledon closure in dark grown seedlings citation . western blotting of extracts from these transgenic plants showed that _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ failed to produce significant amounts of stable protein explaining their inability to rescue _PROTEIN_ . these are all c terminal modifications supporting a role for the c terminus in protein stability . _PROTEIN_ has a similar phenotype to _PROTEIN_ citation which produces approximately wild type message citation so perhaps _PROTEIN_ results in a comparable amount of functional protein . _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ produced detectable amounts of tagged protein and so were characterized further . similar to _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was detected both in _LOCATION_ and in cytoplasmic strands citation . plants displaying a _PROTEIN_ phenotype including partially rescued plants exhibit endogenous _METHOD_ particularly in vesicle like structures around the _LOCATION_ . no significant _LOCATION_ localization of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ could be detected above this background _METHOD_ but it could be seen in cytoplasmic strands citation . gel filtration analysis indicated that _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was still able to form an approximately kda complex whereas _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ formed a larger complex citation . in summary citation the single amino acid change introduced by the _PROTEIN_ mutation virtually abolishes _LOCATION_ localization and kda complex formation whereas the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ truncation at least partially _PROTEIN_ these properties despite its lack of intact _LOCATION_ localization sequences . failure of this construct to rescue is presumably due to the absence of some key functional domain in the _PROTEIN_ c terminus . overall these results further support the hypothesis that _LOCATION_ localization and kda complex formation are required for full _PROTEIN_ function . these studies suggested to us that the kda complex was worth characterizing further . however despite its utility as a marker of cellular localization the _METHOD_ tag was not an ideal biochemical epitope in this instance commercial anti _METHOD_ antibodies detected significant background in arabidopsis extracts and the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ signal was never very robust even when overexpressed from a strong promoter . in contrast an n terminal _PROTEIN_ fusion protein resulted in _PROTEIN_ rescue and increased signal strength with virtually no background so it was used for further biochemical studies . like _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ myc _PROTEIN_ was detected primarily in an approximately kda complex _PROTEIN_ of whether the source seedlings were grown in the light or the dark citation . in addition no significant light/dark differences were detected in myc _PROTEIN_ abundance or in protein charge as assayed on isoelectric focusing gels . also _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was _LOCATION_ localized in both light and dark . thus the basis of light regulation of _PROTEIN_ function is still unclear . we wanted to identify the components of the _PROTEIN_ complex but large scale biochemical purification from arabidopsis was not possible because the abundance of even the overexpressed myc _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ with plant age . therefore we introduced the myc _PROTEIN_ transgene into tobacco bright yellow cells where it could be continually _PROTEIN_ in a uniform population of cells grown to large volumes citation . by cell _PROTEIN_ myc _PROTEIN_ still formed an approximately kda complex citation . in contrast baculovirus produced _PROTEIN_ his strep was detected only as a monomer citation . this result suggested that the kda complex is not simply a _PROTEIN_ multimer and that arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ may interact specifically with other plant proteins . to purify these additional plant proteins we incubated extracts of myc _PROTEIN_ transformed by cells with myc beads washed them extensively and then the complex was eluted at low ph . complex elution was followed by an myc western blot citation . _METHOD_ blue staining of the eluted fractions always detected an approximately kda protein with the same elution profile as myc _PROTEIN_ citation . this protein was never detected when the same experiment was performed with untransformed by cells . these results were obtained at least a dozen times in both large and small scale preparations . to determine the identity of this unknown kda tobacco protein we excised the copurifying band and analyzed it with maldi _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . this technique accurately measures the _METHOD_ of tryptic peptides of an unknown protein . these peptide _METHOD_ are then compared with the theoretical peptide _METHOD_ of tryptic digests of proteins predicted by the sequence database . because little tobacco sequence is available identification of the kda protein requires that its peptide _METHOD_ match those of a homolog in a sequenced species such as arabidopsis citation or rice citation . peltier et al . citation set the following criteria for unambiguous cross species identification . within a stringent ppm deviation in _METHOD_ at least four nonoverlapping peptides must account for at least of the sequence of the identified protein . in our analysis a single protein an arabidopsis homolog of uv damaged dna binding protein _PROTEIN_ exceeded these standards citation . the rice and a second arabidopsis homolog _PROTEIN_ were also close matches to the tryptic _METHOD_ determined from the unknown protein . finally the kda _METHOD_ of agrees well with the estimated _METHOD_ of the unknown protein . thus _PROTEIN_ copurifies with the plant homolog of . is a highly conserved protein citation . arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ is and identical to its rice human drosophila and s. pombe homologs . the primary sequence does not contain any known functional motifs although it has been proposed to form several propeller structures citation . although was initially identified as a component of a uv damaged dna binding activity absent in a subset of xeroderma pigmentosa patients citation its role in nucleotide excision repair is unclear citation . vertebrate uv ddb has also been shown to interact with a variety of cell cycle proteins citation viral _PROTEIN_ citation and chromatin remodeling complexes citation . despite all these biochemical interactions no genetic role has been described for in animals . arabidopsis appears to be one of the few _METHOD_ with two functional copies of the gene at _PROTEIN_ and at _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ sequence tags have been detected for _PROTEIN_ in roots siliques adult aerial tissue and seed and for _PROTEIN_ they have been detected in adult aerial tissue citation ddb a ddb b . in order to examine 's role in arabidopsis particularly with respect to light signaling we used reverse genetics to knockout _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ function . we used pcr to screen for t dna insertions in the genes and knockout lines of both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were obtained . loss of _PROTEIN_ appears to be lethal plants heterozygous for a t dna insertion in _PROTEIN_ produce no viable homozygotes suggesting that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ some key function in reproduction or embryogenesis . in contrast homozygous loss of _PROTEIN_ results in no obvious visible phenotype . although _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are nearly identical at the amino acid level the maldi _METHOD_ data from the kda tobacco _PROTEIN_ interacting protein more closely matches that of _PROTEIN_ citation . to more closely examine the genetic interaction between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ we generated the double mutant . the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant exhibited enhancement of virtually all _PROTEIN_ phenotypes examined . when grown in the dark the _PROTEIN_ single mutant was indistinguishable from the wild type whereas the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant was significantly shorter than _PROTEIN_ alone . in addition the double mutant ectopically produced anthocyanin to a greater degree than _PROTEIN_ alone citation . when grown in the light the double mutants had shorter hypocotyls smaller cotyledons and higher levels of anthocyanin than _PROTEIN_ all consistent with enhancement of the _PROTEIN_ phenotype . light grown _PROTEIN_ seedlings are pale and the double mutants were even paler as determined by analysis of chlorophyll content citation . _PROTEIN_ mutants not only underproduced chlorophyll but they also did so with a higher chlorophyll a/b ratio than the wild type consistent with previously described light acclimation defects citation . interestingly this was the only examined _PROTEIN_ phenotype that was not enhanced by the _PROTEIN_ mutation instead _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutants exhibited a lower chlorophyll a/b ratio than the wild type citation . in adult plants the _PROTEIN_ mutation enhanced _PROTEIN_ 's dwarf stature and lack of apical dominance . in addition the double mutants were infertile . to determine the basis of this infertility we examined double mutant flowers . the primary defect appeared to be a lack of stamen elongation coupled with delayed pollen maturation . upon examination of _PROTEIN_ flowers we found that they had stamens that were shorter than those of the wild type although not to the extent observed in the double mutant citation . this may account for _PROTEIN_ 's reduced fertility . the double mutant flowers exhibited additional defects such as reduced sepal and _PROTEIN_ size aberrant ovule formation and occasional homeotic transformation such as stigmatal tissue on sepals . overall the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant behaved like a strong _PROTEIN_ allele although not as strong as the null alleles because these are seedling lethal whereas the double mutant survived to adulthood .
all general molecular biology and biochemistry techniques were performed with standard methods citation . growth of arabidopsis citation and tobacco by cells citation was according to standard protocols . both wild type and _PROTEIN_ seedlings were grown in the dark for three days and then exposed to s of white _METHOD_ light . plate media was murashige and skoog medium _METHOD_ plus phytagar with no sucrose added . total rna was prepared from seedlings at and min after the beginning of the light treatment . this rna was then used to prepare probes for hybridization to affymetrix genechip arrays according to the manufacturer 's instructions . the data were loaded into genespring and normalized to the percentile . all data were included in the analysis . normalization value was restricted to a minimum of in eight out of eight conditions . the genes were further restricted to those with a minimum raw data value of in four out of eight conditions _PROTEIN_ . genes were considered to be induced by light if their _PROTEIN_ was at least fold higher than that in the dark grown sample at two or more consecutive time points thus requiring temporal replication of data . genes were considered to be repressed by light if their _PROTEIN_ was fold lower than that in the dark grown sample at two or more consecutive time points . to confirm our dark grown data we compared those genes over and underexpressed by at least fold in dark grown _PROTEIN_ in this experiment and a completely independent analysis citation . despite differences in experimental conditions genes behaved similarly in both experiments whereas only genes behaved in the opposite manner thus we believe the data presented here accurately reflect the status of gene _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ cdna was cloned either n or c terminal to an arabidopsis optimized _METHOD_ in binary vector as described previously citation . mutations were introduced via site directed mutagenesis and truncations were introduced via pcr amplification of shortened versions of the protein . wild type col plants and _PROTEIN_ mutants were transformed via standard agrobacterium mediated techniques citation . we examined rescue in the generation by plating seeds on _METHOD_ sucrose kanamycin plates incubating the seeds at overnight treating them with light for hr and then incubating them in the dark for days . ten seedlings/line were measured for hypocotyl length and cotyledon opening was inspected visually . lines were scored for rescue according to the following scheme hypocotyl length not significantly different from _PROTEIN_ controls open cotyledons intermediate hypocotyl length open cotyledons hypocotyl length not significantly different from wild type controls open cotyledons hypocotyl length not significantly different from wild type controls intermediate cotyledons hypocotyl length not significantly different from wild type controls closed cotyledons . for _METHOD_ localization three to day old dark grown seedlings from transformed lines per construct were examined with an fitc filter on an olympus microscope equipped with a mercury lamp and deltavision software . for protein analysis approximately g of tissue from day old light grown seedlings was frozen in liquid nitrogen ground in a mortar and pestle with ml protein extract buffer thawed then spun for min at rpm at . equal amounts of total protein were analyzed by western blot and probed with _METHOD_ antibody . for gel filtration approximately total protein was loaded onto a sephadex column equilibrated in gel filtration buffer and eluted in ml fractions . gel filtration standards were used to calibrate the column . the void volume eluted in fractions and so _METHOD_ above about kda were not accurately resolved . samples were precipitated with an equal volume of trichloroacetic acid then analyzed via western blot . myc _PROTEIN_ was constructed by fusion of a tag to the n terminus of the _PROTEIN_ cdna and subsequent fusion into the binary vector _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ his strep was made by fusion of a his and strep tag ii to the _PROTEIN_ c terminus this construct was then cloned into the baculovirus vector . clarified lysate of transfected cells was loaded onto the sephadex column as above and fractions were western blotted and detected with peroxidase labeled strepavidin _PROTEIN_ . myc _PROTEIN_ was stably transformed into tobacco by cells as described citation . small scale protein extract preparation and gel filtration analysis were performed as described above with myc polyclonal used for blotting . for complex purification approximately ml packed cell volume of transformed by cells were mixed with peb frozen and ground as above and centrifuged at rpm in an ss rotor at for min then centrifuged again at rpm in a rotor at for min . the resulting approximately ml supernatant was incubated with rotation at for hr with ml myc beads . the beads were collected with a low speed spin washed in bulk with ml gf buffer and then loaded onto a small column . six ml fractions of m nh acetate were used to elute the complex then lyophilized overnight . the fractions were resuspended in sample buffer and analyzed with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . the _METHOD_ blue stained kda band was excised with a razor blade and trypsin digested then peptide _METHOD_ were determined on a perseptive voyager _PROTEIN_ maldi _METHOD_ spectrometer in reflector mode . database searching was done with profound . t dna insertions in the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ genes were found by using pcr to screen pools of col insertion lines with t dna and gene specific primers . insertion sites were confirmed by sequencing . the _PROTEIN_ allele has an insertion approximately bp upstream of the translation start site whereas the _PROTEIN_ insertion is in the splice site of the tenth exon . the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant was generated from a cross of _PROTEIN_ to _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are only about cm apart on chromosome iv so progeny were screened first for the _PROTEIN_ phenotype and then for the _PROTEIN_ allele by pcr . a single double homozygote and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plants were obtained from about total . the double homozygote was infertile and the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ heterozygotes were only partially fertile so approximately wild type were screened for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ heterozygotes by pcr for the _PROTEIN_ allele and a _PROTEIN_ caps marker . eight _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ individuals were identified and all eight segregate apparently wild type to double mutant progeny in a ratio . all analysis described was performed on these segregating progeny of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plants . anthocyanin and chlorophyll measurements were performed on pooled populations as described in _PROTEIN_ citation except that arnon 's equations citation were used to calculate chlorophyll and two independent samples/genotype were analyzed . a supplementary table giving microarray data is available online at http //images.cellpress.com/supmat/supmatin.htm .
