members of a large family of cellulose synthase like genes are predicted to encode glycosyl transferases _PROTEIN_ involved in the biosynthesis of plant cell walls . the csla and cslf families are known to contain mannan and _PROTEIN_ synthases respectively but the products of other csls are unknown . here we report the effects of disrupting _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis . both stem and root growth were significantly reduced in _PROTEIN_ knock out plants and these plants also had increased susceptibility to the cellulose synthase inhibitor isoxaben . antibody and _PROTEIN_ binding module labelling indicated a reduction in the level of xylan in _METHOD_ and in vitro _PROTEIN_ assays using microsomes from _METHOD_ revealed that _PROTEIN_ knock out plants also had reduced xylan and homogalacturonan synthase activity . _PROTEIN_ in nicotiana benthamiana of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ tagged at either the c or the n terminal indicated that these _PROTEIN_ are likely to be localized in the _LOCATION_ apparatus . however the position of the _METHOD_ tag affected the subcellular localization of both proteins . the work presented provides a comprehensive analysis of the effects of disrupting _PROTEIN_ in planta and the possible role of this gene and other _PROTEIN_ in cell wall biosynthesis are discussed .
four t dna homozygote insertion mutant lines were generated all in the col ecotype with insertions in different parts of the _PROTEIN_ gene designated _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . although _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ had insertions in the promoter region whilst _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ had insertions in the first and last exons of the _PROTEIN_ gene respectively . levels of _PROTEIN_ transcript were assessed using rt pcr . only line _PROTEIN_ showed an apparent complete loss of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and most of the work described here involves this line . complementation lines were generated by insertion of the wild type _PROTEIN_ gene into _PROTEIN_ . rt pcr analyses of two such lines _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ indicated that _PROTEIN_ transcript levels were indeed restored to at least wt levels . the stem height of mature _PROTEIN_ knock out plants was significantly reduced compared with both wt plants and the _PROTEIN_ line which retained _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . stem growth was reduced in _PROTEIN_ during stem development and the root length of day old _PROTEIN_ seedlings was also less than that for wt control seedlings . the diameter of rosettes was also reduced in _PROTEIN_ compared with wt . all of these reduced growth characteristics were restored to wt levels following complementation with _PROTEIN_ driven by its own promoter . as shown in figure b the stem growth of complemented lines was similar to wt col transformed with empty vector . similarly the root growth of seedlings of one of these lines _PROTEIN_ was similar to wt plants transformed with empty vector as was rosette diameter . transverse sections were taken through _PROTEIN_ inflorescence _METHOD_ of week old plants at three points top middle _METHOD_ and base . sections were labelled with a panel of monoclonal antibodies and _PROTEIN_ binding modules _METHOD_ with specificity for cell wall polymers including cellulose hemicelluloses and pectin . no differences in labelling between wt and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were observed with probes for arabinan xyloglucan homogalacturonan mannan crystalline cellulose xylogalacturonan or _PROTEIN_ . this was also the case for galactan _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . in contrast labelling with a mab with specificity for xylan indicated that compared with wt plants of the same age the occurrence of xylan was reduced in _METHOD_ of _PROTEIN_ plants . the reduction was most pronounced in the top portion of _METHOD_ but was also apparent to a lesser extent in sections taken from the middle and the base of _METHOD_ . in the top portion of wt _METHOD_ xylan was present in both xylem and interfasicular tissue whereas in sections from _PROTEIN_ plants labelling was restricted to xylem tissue only . xylan was also reduced somewhat in sections taken from the middle and base of _METHOD_ of _PROTEIN_ plants . similar results were obtained using a _PROTEIN_ binding module which also has specificity for xylan . it was clear from immunocytochemical analysis of both wt and mutant plants that the occurrence of xylan in _METHOD_ was modulated in a gradient from base to apex with the greatest abundance of xylan at the stem base . it was therefore important to determine whether the reduced occurrence of xylan observed in _PROTEIN_ was simply a result of reduced stem growth or was independent of this . to do this we compared both age matched and developmentally matched plants . in the case of the latter sections were taken from _PROTEIN_ plants that were days older than wt plants of the same stem height . these labelling experiments established that _PROTEIN_ plants that were developmentally matched to wt plants also had reduced levels of xylan . staining with toluidine blue was used to visualize the cellular anatomy of stem sections . no differences were observed between wt and _PROTEIN_ plants suggesting that the reduction in mab and cbm labelling in _METHOD_ of _PROTEIN_ plants was the result of reduced xylan in cell walls rather than a reduction in the number of cells with xylan containing cell walls . no differences in labelling between wt and _PROTEIN_ were observed for any mabs or _METHOD_ when applied to roots of mature plants and seedlings and seedling hypocotyls . glycosyl transferase assays were performed using microsomes extracted from developmentally matched _PROTEIN_ and wt plants of the same stem height . as shown in figure xylan synthase activity was reduced in _PROTEIN_ plants compared with wt plants . to a somewhat lesser extent hg synthase activity was also reduced in _PROTEIN_ plants . in contrast there was no difference in _PROTEIN_ synthase activity between _PROTEIN_ and wt . the products of the xylan synthase assay were digested with both xylanase and proteinase k in order to determine if the xylose had been incorporated into xylan or a xylosidated protein . as shown in figure almost all xylose was released by xylanase and very little by proteinase k indicating that the product formed was predominantly xylan . the genevestigator database which collates information derived from over transcript profiling experiments was used for initial in silico analysis of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . the gene atlas function provides information about the location of gene _PROTEIN_ and indicated that _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ to some extent in all organs/tissues but is _PROTEIN_ at highest levels in the shoot apex and hypocotyl . the meta analyzer tool which reports on gene _PROTEIN_ during development indicated that _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ most abundantly during the stem elongation phase between and days . plants transformed with the _PROTEIN_ gene driven by the _PROTEIN_ genomic promoter were used to provide more detailed information about _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . in cotyledons cauline leaves rosette leaves and roots gus activity was localized predominantly in vascular tissues . gus activity was essentially absent from flowers and siliques but some weak activity was evident at the silique/pedicel junction . in sections taken from the middle region of _METHOD_ gus activity was most abundant in a layer of cells between the secondary xylem interfasicular region and cortex corresponding to the position of the vascular cambium . some activity was also present in phloem tissue and weak activity in cortical and pith parenchyma cells . it should be noted that previous work has indicated that caution is required when interpreting gus _PROTEIN_ in phloem tissue because of the possibility of the loading of gus reaction products into phloem via symplastic connections . the small size of phloem cells may also lead to misleadingly high colour densities . the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ was determined in vivo by transient _PROTEIN_ in nicotiana benthamiana . previous work to determine the subcellular localization of another _PROTEIN_ family member _PROTEIN_ concluded that this protein is localized in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . in this earlier work a c terminal _METHOD_ fusion of _PROTEIN_ was used and we repeated this for both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . confocal laser scanning microscopy of transformed plants showed that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ localized as a filigree network within the cytoplasm between the _LOCATION_ and the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ that is characteristic of the _LOCATION_ . this localization was confirmed by co infiltration with the _LOCATION_ marker protein _METHOD_ hdel and when signals from the two _METHOD_ proteins were merged a nearly complete overlap was obtained . the same result was obtained using _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . similar experiments were performed using _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ co infiltrated with the _LOCATION_ marker protein _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . as expected the signal from _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ had a punctuate distribution typical of _LOCATION_ apparatus localization and merging the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signals indicated very limited overlap . these data suggested that _PROTEIN_ like _PROTEIN_ is _LOCATION_ localized . however a considerable body of evidence indicates that _PROTEIN_ involved in cell wall biosyntheses are located either at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ or at the _LOCATION_ apparatus and not at the _LOCATION_ . furthermore proteomic lopit analysis has recently demonstrated that _PROTEIN_ is in _PROTEIN_ localized in the _LOCATION_ apparatus . with this _PROTEIN_ we speculated that the fusion of _METHOD_ proteins to the c terminal of _PROTEIN_ might disrupt normal targeting and lead to an _LOCATION_ localization via a default pathway . therefore we also analysed an n terminal fusion of _PROTEIN_ . the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion produced a punctuate distribution of signal and a merging of signals obtained from co infiltrated _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and the _LOCATION_ marker _METHOD_ hdel revealed essentially no overlap . in contrast when _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was co infiltrated with the _LOCATION_ apparatus marker _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ the signals obtained were nearly identical with a high degree of overlap in the merged signals . this was also the case for _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . taken together these data indicate that _PROTEIN_ is likely to be located in the _LOCATION_ apparatus . using global transcript profiling we have previously demonstrated that the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ was highly and differentially _PROTEIN_ when arabidopsis cell suspension cultures were habituated to grow in the cellulose synthase inhibitor isoxaben . as increased _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was correlated to the ability of cells to grow in isoxaben we were interested to see if the disruption of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in seedlings resulted in increased sensitivity to isoxaben when incorporated into growth medium . the roots of _PROTEIN_ seedlings transformed with empty vector _PROTEIN_ were shorter than those of wt seedlings transformed with empty vector and the root length of both wt col ev and _PROTEIN_ seedlings was severely reduced when grown in nm isoxaben . however the degree of reduction was significantly greater for _PROTEIN_ ev compared with wt col ev seedlings . however when _PROTEIN_ seedlings complemented with the wt _PROTEIN_ gene _PROTEIN_ were grown in isoxaben the degree of reduction in root length was similar to that of wt col ev seedlings grown in isoxaben . these data indicate that disruption of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was correlated with increased sensitivity to isoxaben .

are described in _PROTEIN_ et al . respectively . for complementation of the _PROTEIN_ knock out mutant the corresponding _PROTEIN_ genomic dna was amplified from the bac clone using oligonucleotides that annealed bp upstream of the start codon and bp downstream of the stop codon of the predicted _PROTEIN_ open reading frame . pfu ultra dna polymerase was used for this amplification . the kb product obtained was ligated into pgemteasy and transformed in escherichia coli using standard procedures . after confirming that the sequence of the clone corresponded to the _PROTEIN_ genomic sequence it was digested with xbai and ligated into using xbai and spei restriction sites . the resulting clone was transformed into agrobacterium tumefaciens strain and was used for plant transformation using the floral dip method . the empty vector was used as the negative control for complementation experiments . for _PROTEIN_ studies using _PROTEIN_ as a reporter gene a construct was generated using the promoter region of _PROTEIN_ as follows the region encompassing bp upstream of the predicted start codon of the gene was amplified from genomic dna using specific
