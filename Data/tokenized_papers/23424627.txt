the arabidopsis thaliana genome contains _PROTEIN_ which are proposed to encode cyclic nucleotide gated non selective permeable ion channels . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are the two most similar with protein sequence identity and both genes are preferentially _PROTEIN_ in pollen . two independent loss of function t dna insertions were identified for both genes and used to generate plant lines in which only one of the two alleles was segregating _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . while normal pollen transmission was observed for single gene mutations pollen harboring mutations in both _PROTEIN_ and were found to be male sterile . pollen grains harboring t dna disruptions of both _PROTEIN_ and displayed a high frequency of bursting when germinated in vitro . the male sterile defect could be rescued through pollen _PROTEIN_ of a _PROTEIN_ or transgene including a _PROTEIN_ with an n terminal _METHOD_ tag . however rescue efficiencies were reduced fold when the _PROTEIN_ or included an f to w substitution at the junction between the putative cyclic nucleotide binding site and the calmodulin binding site identifying this junction as important for proper functioning of a plant _PROTEIN_ . using confocal microscopy _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was found to preferentially localize to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ at the flanks of the growing tip . together these results indicate that _PROTEIN_ and are at least partially redundant and provide an essential function at the initiation of pollen tube tip growth .
among the six _PROTEIN_ that are most highly _PROTEIN_ in a. thaliana pollen _PROTEIN_ and are the two most closely related . to determine if these genes have redundant functions in pollen development two independent t dna gene disruptions for each gene were obtained from publically available t dna insertion collections _PROTEIN_ and . the _PROTEIN_ and alleles have insertions located in exons that encode essential features for a _PROTEIN_ . as individual mutations all four insertions showed normal mendelian segregation when heterozygous plants were self fertilized or tested for pollen transmission in a manual cross . a relative _PROTEIN_ levels in different tissues are shown for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ obtained from the arabidopsis

insertions are shown for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . arrows indicate the direction of the t dna left border . coding sequences are highlighted with expanded rectangles lines indicate introns and flanking dna sequences . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ each have five exons and encode proteins with six transmembrane spanning domains a pore between and a cyclic nucleotide binding domain _PROTEIN_ and a calmodulin binding site . b a diagram of chromosome showing the arrangement of different combinations of _PROTEIN_ and alleles in which one of the two alleles is segregating with either a bastar or sulfr marker . expected percentages based on mendelian segregation . significance determined by the pearson s chi squared test with two degrees of freedom . pcr genotyping . mutant allele scored by sulfr marker . mutant allele scored by bastar maker . by pcr genotyping . by pcr genotyping . no homozygous double knockout found . the creation of plants harboring independent sets of double knockouts required the identification of cross over recombination events between different pairs of _PROTEIN_ and t dna insertions since _PROTEIN_ and are closely linked on chromosome . plant lines with different sets of alleles were allowed to self fertilize and plant lines with the following genotypes were identified in which only one of the two alleles was segregating _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . for three of these genotype combinations the segregating allele is linked to a unique selectable marker gene associated with the t dna insertion either providing resistance to glufosinate ammonium or sulfadiazine . to try and identify a homozygous _PROTEIN_ double knockout _PROTEIN_ combinations segregating only one of the mutant alleles were allowed to self fertilize and the progeny was genotyped by pcr assays . in more than progeny analyzed no plants were found harboring a double homozygous mutation . this segregation distortion was corroborated by analyzing the transmission frequencies of the bastar or sulfr markers associated with two different _PROTEIN_ knockout combinations . to determine if the inability to segregate a homozygous _PROTEIN_ mutant was due to a male or female defect reciprocal crosses were conducted with three of the different allele combinations . for transmission of the _PROTEIN_ double mutation through the female we observed the expected transmission frequency . in contrast no male transmission events were ever detected in more than progeny analyzed indicating that pollen transmission was reduced by more than fold . to corroborate that the _PROTEIN_ mutations used here represent loss of function null alleles we tested whether the pollen transmission phenotype could be rescued by pollen _PROTEIN_ of a transgene encoding either _PROTEIN_ or . the n terminal ends of _PROTEIN_ and were engineered with either _METHOD_ or a _PROTEIN_ tag and the transgenes were _PROTEIN_ under the control of either a strong or weak pollen promoter _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . outcrosses to a female _PROTEIN_ were done using pollen from plants that were _PROTEIN_ and hemizygous for a transgene encoding either a _METHOD_ or _PROTEIN_ tagged _PROTEIN_ or . in this situation meiosis produces pollen with the following genotypes _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . since a _PROTEIN_ pollen without a transgene fails to show any transmission only of the meiotic products have the potential for transmission . thus a transgene providing a perfect rescue of _PROTEIN_ pollen would result in of the progeny showing the transmission of the _PROTEIN_ double knockout as scored by the segregation of the sulfr marker associated with the _PROTEIN_ allele . while all transgene variations tested were able to rescue the _PROTEIN_ pollen transmission defect to some extent the best transmission frequencies were observed for pollen harboring a _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ transgene _PROTEIN_ under the control of the relatively weak _PROTEIN_ promoter . these results indicate that the _PROTEIN_ mutations studied here result in loss of function phenotypes that can rescued by a transgene encoding either a _PROTEIN_ for _PROTEIN_ . pollen transmission efficiencies for _PROTEIN_ are shown as scored by the transmission of the sulfr marker to progeny . the sulf r marker was associated with the _PROTEIN_ allele that was segregating in the parental line . the _PROTEIN_ allele was homozygous . pollen outcrosses were made by manually pollinating females that were wild type or _PROTEIN_ with equivalent results . all pollen outcrosses were done using male parents that were verified by reciprocal crosses to be hemizygous for the transgene . in these pollen outcross assays a perfect rescue would result in of the progeny carrying the sulfr marker because only of the meiotic products have the potential to show transmission to progeny . numbers preceded by ss under each bar represent independent transgenic lines used for outcrossing . homozygous double knockout seed stocks created by selfing or out crossing are identified in . lines shown displayed typical rescue efficiencies mediated by transgene constructs for _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or f to w _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . three additional homozyogus rescued lines were obtained using a transgene construct i _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . to generate a mutant plant with only a partial rescue of _PROTEIN_ rescue constructs were engineered to encode mutant versions of _PROTEIN_ and that contained an or substitution respectively . these substitutions are positioned at a site conserved in plant _PROTEIN_ near the _PROTEIN_ end of the predicted cyclic nucleotide binding domain _PROTEIN_ and the beginning of a potentially overlapping calmodulin binding site . the respective rescue constructs harboring f to w substitutions were introduced into plants in which the _PROTEIN_ allele was homozygous and the allele was segregating _PROTEIN_ . pollen was then outcrossed and the transmission frequency of a _PROTEIN_ double knockout scored in progeny by either pcr genotyping or the _PROTEIN_ of a sulfr phenotype . in contrast to a robust rescue using a wild type version of a _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or the incorporation of an f to w substitution reduced the pollen transmission efficiency by to fold . to evaluate whether the f to w substitutions would also compromise the seed set potential in a homozygous mutant homozygous _PROTEIN_ lines rescued with a _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were identified by pcr genotyping . although individual plants sometimes showed a reduction in seed set compared to wild type controls this phenotype was not consistently observed . to understand the cause of this variation three different plants displaying poor seed set were manually fertilized with the plant s own pollen . in these cases the manual self fertilization was able to restore full seed set . this indicates that the variation in seed set is not a defect associated with the female gametophyte . rather the variation is either a result of less pollen being delivered to the stigma and/or a further _PROTEIN_ in pollen fitness due to unknown variations in growth environments or plant health . to determine why _PROTEIN_ mutant pollen are sterile we first conducted a semi in vivo pollen tube growth assay using pollen from a double knockout mutant segregating a _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ rescue construct to of the pollen grains . to set up these assays receptive stigmas were manually pollinated and then cut and transferred to an agar surface for semi in vivo growth . the only tubes observed to grow were those that showed _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and therefore were rescued by a _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ transgene . the absence of any tubes without a _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ suggested that non rescued mutant tubes were defective at some early stage of pollen grain germination or tube growth . in vitro pollen germination assays were then used to specifically evaluate potential defects at early stages of tip growth initiation . in these assays we evaluated two different combinations of _PROTEIN_ alleles in which only one of the alleles was segregating . for both allele combinations we observed a high frequency of pollen grains bursting . in contrast wild type controls showed an average bursting frequency of less than . for _PROTEIN_ mutants the bursting events usually occurred before any tube growth could be detected . similar bursting phenotypes and frequencies were observed using two different standard germination media . pollen grains were germinated in vitro and scored for bursting at the time of germination . a fold higher bursting frequency was observed for two different combinations of _PROTEIN_ alleles _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in which only one of the alleles was segregating . an equivalent bursting frequency was observed for a _PROTEIN_ double knockout in which only of the pollen harbored a rescue construct encoding _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . a bursting frequency was observed when a _PROTEIN_ double knockout was rescued with a _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or harboring an f to w substitution . in these f to w examples the pollen came from a mixed pool of parental plants that were either hemizygous or homozygous for the transgene . each hash mark indicates the bursting for each of the six independent experiments . results using two different media showed equivalent results . pollen were germinated in vitro and imaged . dic images are shown to the left and corresponding confocal _METHOD_ micrographs to the right . a a negative control showing a wild type pollen tube without any _METHOD_ . b and c _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ showing a tip focused pm _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ localization at the emerging tube and the tip shank during tube extension . d a non rescued pollen from _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ showing a typical bursting event at germination . scale bar . a _PROTEIN_ dependent bursting phenotype was confirmed in two ways . first in vitro germination assays were done with homozygous _PROTEIN_ mutants in which of the pollen were _PROTEIN_ a rescue construct encoding _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . plants segregating of their pollen with a rescue construct were identified by imaging pollen from each plant for the _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ . using pollen from these plants the bursting frequency was near . this is consistent with the expectation that of the mutant pollen would be rescued from bursting through the _PROTEIN_ of a _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . this was corroborated by confocal _METHOD_ microscopy which revealed that the only tubes to grow beyond the budding stage were those that showed _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . a second approach was to examine the frequency of bursting in mutant pollen grains from _PROTEIN_ plants that harbor transgenes that conferred only a partial rescue . for these pollen _PROTEIN_ either _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ the bursting frequency was around which was about fold higher than wild type controls . to provide evidence for the subcellular location of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ confocal microscopy was used to image _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in pollen . all imaging was done with homozygous _PROTEIN_ mutants that had been rescued by pollen _PROTEIN_ of a _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . two different promoters were used to drive _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . we failed to see detectable levels of _METHOD_ using a weak promoter from _PROTEIN_ although this promoter was capable of providing low levels of _PROTEIN_ sufficient for functional rescues . therefore to obtain high enough _PROTEIN_ levels for imaging we employed a stronger promoter from _PROTEIN_ which resulted in a range of _PROTEIN_ levels from high to barely detectable . shows representative images of cells that have relatively weak but detectable levels of _PROTEIN_ . pollen with very high levels of _PROTEIN_ always showed strong _METHOD_ throughout the cell including endomembranes _PROTEIN_ . however since functional rescues were observed with very low _PROTEIN_ levels _PROTEIN_ we posit that images corresponding to low _PROTEIN_ levels are more likely to reflect a normal distribution for a _PROTEIN_ and less likely to be an artifact of over _PROTEIN_ . with the imaging parameters used here _METHOD_ was occasionally seen associated with the cell wall . however no other significant background _METHOD_ was detected within cells . in comparison pollen _PROTEIN_ relatively low levels of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ showed strong _METHOD_ signals predominately associated with the pm at the bud site and in growing tubes predominately at a region flanking the growing tip .
