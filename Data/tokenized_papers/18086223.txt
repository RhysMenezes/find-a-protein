the transport of phosphate between subcellular compartments is central to metabolic regulation . although some of the transporters involved in controlling the intracellular distribution of pi have been identified in plants others are predicted from genetic biochemical and bioinformatics studies . heterologous _PROTEIN_ in yeast and gene _PROTEIN_ and localization in plants were used to characterize all six members of an arabidopsis thaliana _LOCATION_ transporter family designated here as . proteins share similarity with i pi transporters a diverse group of animal proteins involved in the transport of pi organic anions and chloride . all of the proteins mediate pi transport in yeast with high specificity . bioinformatic analysis and localization of _METHOD_ fusion proteins indicate that five of the proteins are targeted to the _LOCATION_ envelope and the sixth resides in the _LOCATION_ apparatus . genes are _PROTEIN_ in both roots and leaves although two of the genes are _PROTEIN_ predominantly in leaves and one mostly in roots . these _PROTEIN_ patterns together with pi transport activities and subcellular locations suggest roles for proteins in the transport of pi between the _LOCATION_ and chloroplasts heterotrophic _LOCATION_ and the _LOCATION_ apparatus .
the arabidopsis genome contains six genes that encode proteins with similarity to members of the i pi transporter family which includes mammalian type i pi transporters vesicular glutamate transporters and sialin a lysosomal sialic acid transporter . the arabidopsis proteins designated here as through have putative _LOCATION_ domains and share similarity with each other and similarity with the human members . multiple anion transport activities have been attributed to members of the i pi transporter family for example pi chloride and glutamate transport but nearly all of the characterized proteins also exhibit na pi transport . thus we hypothesized that the similar proteins might also have pi transport functions . to test this hypothesis we first used to obtain cdnas corresponding to the full coding regions of each gene and cloned the amplicons into a yeast _PROTEIN_ vector . multiple splice variants are predicted for some of the genes however we sequenced at least three independent clones for each cdna and in all cases detected a single form that matched the respective genbank accession listed in table . we then tested each of the cdna clones for the ability to complement the growth defect of a yeast pi transport mutant . the yeast _PROTEIN_ strain lacks functional copies of both pi transporter genes present in yeast and and thus grows poorly when supplied with limiting amounts of pi . the remaining transporters provide sufficient activity for propagation of this strain under the nonselective conditions . as shown in fig . all six members of the family complemented the growth defect of _PROTEIN_ cells although was capable of complementation only when the region predicted by chlorop to encode an amino acid transit peptide was deleted . all strains grew equally well when supplied with higher concentrations of pi . uptake assays were used to confirm and analyze transport mediated by each of the proteins _PROTEIN_ in yeast . in all cases net transport was linear with respect to time for at least min . each of the cultures _PROTEIN_ a protein displayed saturable pi transport with initial rates to fourfold greater than cells carrying the empty _PROTEIN_ vector . because transport velocities were similar results are shown in fig . only for the cells exhibiting the highest and lowest activities . to estimate apparent km values the component of net transport contributed by the yeast endogenous transport activity was subtracted before nonlinear regression analysis . background activities were determined from concurrent measurements with the control cells . in each case the apparent km values were similar for three independent experiments and ranged from mm for to mm for . these values differ significantly from that of the background activity mm . given the broad range of anions transported by some i pi transporters we investigated the specificity of transporters by testing various anions for the ability to compete with pi for uptake . potential inhibitors were added to cells at molar excess to pi and the rates of pi accumulation were compared with those for cells treated with water . all of the transporters appeared highly specific for pi under these conditions because only arsenate a structural analog of pi caused inhibition at a concentration approaching that of unlabeled pi . addition of sulfate and nitrate did result in a slight reduction in pi transport catalyzed by but the basis for this inhibition is unknown . we measured the uptake of for each of the cultures using essentially the same growth and assay conditions as for pi but all cultures including the control exhibited an equivalent transport rate of pmol mg . this result suggests that _PROTEIN_ of the proteins has no general effect on anion permeability of the yeast cells and that either does not mediate sulfate transport or does so to a degree that is effectively masked by endogenous activities . phosphate transport activities were assessed at ph values ranging from to and differences were detected in the activity profiles but in each case transport was maximal at ph values of or and declined sharply at ph . the magnitude of the changes in activity from ph to ph can not be explained solely by a preference for the monobasic form of pi which would _PROTEIN_ only . thus the relatively broad acidic ph optima may reflect intrinsic properties of the transporter proteins . treatment of cells with the protonophore _PROTEIN_ caused a significant _PROTEIN_ in the rates of pi transport suggesting that transport may be dependent on the force although secondary effects such as changes in _LOCATION_ ph may also affect transport activity . given the similarity of proteins to transporters that mediate na pi transport we investigated whether transport might be affected by na concentration . pi transport activities using our standard uptake medium which contains approx . mm na were compared with those measured in uptake medium in which all of the sodium salts normally present were substituted with potassium salts . although this concentration of na is more than sufficient for maximal activity of the yeast na /pi symporter no differences in net transport activities were detected for any of the proteins under these conditions . the presence of potential organellar targeting sequences located at the of each of the proteins initially led us to hypothesize that some members of this family would localize to _LOCATION_ . consensus subcellular localization predictions derived from different _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ suggest that and are located in _LOCATION_ and that is located within the secretory system . the predictions for and were ambiguous with roughly equivalent consensus scores for _LOCATION_ and mitochondrial localization . this ambiguity was resolved for and the predictions verified for through the use of _METHOD_ fusions which confirmed that both of these proteins are located in chloroplasts . furthermore roth et al . used highly specific antibodies and _LOCATION_ fractionation to demonstrate that is located within the chloroplast inner envelope _LOCATION_ . to test the localization predictions for the other members of the family translational fusion constructs were prepared in which the same coding regions used for functional analyses in yeast were cloned downstream of the cauliflower mosaic virus promoter and fused to the end of _METHOD_ . the constructs were introduced into arabidopsis leaves by particle bombardment and after h the leaves were examined by laser scanning confocal microscopy . the _METHOD_ images revealed that transiently _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ were localized to chloroplasts which were distinguished by red chlorophyll _METHOD_ . by contrast with a _LOCATION_ marker rat sialyl transferase region fused to _METHOD_ . the localization of remains unresolved because green _METHOD_ was not detected in leaves bombarded with the _METHOD_ construct nor a similar truncated fusion containing the first bp of the coding region . _PROTEIN_ of these fusions in transgenic arabidopsis also failed to yield detectable _METHOD_ signals despite the presence of transcripts suggesting that the fusion proteins may be unstable . _PROTEIN_ of genes in photosynthetic and heterotrophic tissues was analyzed by quantitative . tissues were harvested from plants grown hydroponically for wk at which time the plants had rosette leaves but no other green tissues . as shown in fig . large differences exist between the genes in _METHOD_ of transcript abundance and specificity for leaves and roots . and displayed the highest levels of _PROTEIN_ both in leaves . with the exception of and the other four members of this gene family were _PROTEIN_ more abundantly in leaves than in roots . this was most striking for and which were _PROTEIN_ and greater in leaves than in roots respectively consistent with their reported chloroplast localization . however all of the genes exhibited detectable _PROTEIN_ in roots and _PROTEIN_ of was essentially restricted to roots . hence the _LOCATION_ protein members of this family may function in both photosynthetic and heterotrophic _LOCATION_ or in the case of perhaps exclusively in heterotrophic _LOCATION_ . was _PROTEIN_ ubiquitously although slightly more strongly in roots than in leaves . despite differences in growth conditions _PROTEIN_ profiles from the genevestigator microarray databases closely match the patterns depicted in fig . . we also investigated whether transcription of genes was influenced by pi supply . leaf and root tissues were harvested from plants exposed to conditions for d and the _PROTEIN_ levels were compared with those detected under conditions . results shown in fig . indicate that this treatment was sufficient to enhance strongly _PROTEIN_ of two known genes _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . however none of the genes exhibited a change in _PROTEIN_ > suggesting that these genes are not responsive to pi deprivation .
complementary dnas for the full coding regions of each of the six genes were produced by using rna isolated from arabidopsis thaliana heynh . plants . pcr primers were designed to introduce unique restriction sites at the and ends of the genes . the cdna amplicons were cloned into the yeast _PROTEIN_ plasmid . the clone was generated by pcr and lacks the first bp of the coding sequence which corresponds to a acid putative transit peptide and a new _PROTEIN_ start codon was inserted . for subcellular localization experiments coding sequences were amplified from the plasmids described and then cloned in frame upstream of the green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ gene in the plasmid _METHOD_ . cloned inserts for all plasmids were sequenced . constructs were tested for their ability to complement the growth defect of the yeast pi strain _PROTEIN_ . transformed yeast was grown in sd medium containing mm pi and mm buffer ph to an of . was monitored with a beckman coulter spectrophotometer equipped with a turbidity cell holder and a value of corresponded to approx . mg cells . cultures that grew to densities greater than were discarded or diluted once with fresh medium to an of no greater than and regrown . this growth regime was adopted because it was determined empirically that cells grown in rich medium or to higher densities failed to yield consistent results in subsequent analyses . cells were harvested by centrifugation washed with water then suspended to an of and aliquots of serial dilutions were spotted to agar plates containing sd medium mm pi and mm buffer ph . plates were incubated at for up to d. for uptake assays transformed yeast was grown as described earlier washed twice with water then suspended at mg cells . ten microliters of the cell suspension were added to of medium ph and equilibrated at for min with gentle agitation . transport assays were initiated by addition of of at the desired concentration and terminated by the addition of ml of mm buffer followed immediately by filtration on glass fiber filters and an additional wash . the accumulated radioactivity was measured by scintillation spectroscopy . kinetic data were analyzed by nonlinear regression . plants were grown in chambers at with relative humidity and a h photoperiod . for _PROTEIN_ studies individual seeds were placed in ml tubes containing _METHOD_ medium lacking a _PROTEIN_ source and then stratified for d at before transfer to a growth chamber . after d in the growth chamber the tube _METHOD_ were removed and the seedlings were suspended in l growth vessels containing _METHOD_ medium . plants were grown for wk before the solution was replaced with either the same replete medium or medium . after an additional d tissues were harvested at the midpoint of the photoperiod . protein fusion constructs were introduced into leaves of plants by particle bombardment using the biolistic _PROTEIN_ particle delivery system as described previously . after bombardment leaves were incubated at room temperature on filter paper for h before imaging with confocal microscopy . cells were imaged with a es confocal laser scanning microscope equipped with a objective _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . images shown are single optical sections . total rna was isolated from leaf and root tissues of plants with _PROTEIN_ reagent and traces of dna were removed with turbo . two biological replicates consisting of tissues pooled from three plants were used for each analysis . one microgram rna was used to make cdna with a superscript cdna synthesis kit . pcr was performed with sybr green master mix _METHOD_ using the abi prism sequence detection system _METHOD_ . _PROTEIN_ levels were normalized to and fold changes were calculated using the method . the following primers were used for pcr for and for and for and for and for and for and for and for _PROTEIN_ and and for _PROTEIN_ and .
