during phosphate starvation related kinase activity significantly _PROTEIN_ compared with plants growing under normal nutritional conditions . an analysis of the _PROTEIN_ of the genes encoding for the catalytic subunits of showed that these subunits were not affected by phosphate starvation . transgenic arabidopsis plants overexpressing the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ catalytic subunits fused with green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ were produced and their localizations were _PROTEIN_ chloroplastic with low but detectable signals in the cytoplasm . these data were corroborated with an immunocytochemistry analysis using leaf and root sections with an anti _PROTEIN_ antibody . the activity in transgenic plants overexpressing _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was reduced by to in phosphate starvation in contrast with the results observed in plants overexpressing _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ which increased the activity by . no differences in activity were observed in plants growing in phosphate sufficient conditions . biochemical analysis of the proteins indicated that _PROTEIN_ is specifically degraded under these limited conditions and that the increase in _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ activity was not due to the phosphorylation of threonine . these results are consistent with an important role of _PROTEIN_ in signaling during phosphate starvation . moreover _PROTEIN_ mutant plants were deficient in starch mobilization at night during inorganic phosphate starvation and under this condition several genes were up regulated and down regulated indicating their important roles in the control of general transcription . this finding reveals novel roles for the different catalytic subunits during phosphate starvation .
it has been very well documented that kinases of the family are activated in low energy conditions and when glc is absent from the medium . in plants pi starvation is a condition that produces an important reduction in the amount of _PROTEIN_ . to get information about the regulation of during pi deficiency its kinase activity was measured by the phosphorylation of the _METHOD_ peptide . the activity was lower in leaf extracts from pi starved plants . to evaluate if the difference in activity was due to differential _PROTEIN_ of the catalytic subunits we searched the genevestigator database and found that only two of the three genes that encode the catalytic subunits _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were _PROTEIN_ in rosette leaves . no changes in gene _PROTEIN_ were found in plants grown under complete nutritional conditions . in addition after and d of pi starvation semiquantitative reverse transcription pcr indicated that no visible changes occurred in the amount of the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ transcripts . amplification of actin was used as an internal control to indicate equal loading . is a pi starvation inducible gene and was used as an indicator of the pi status . in contrast with _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ induction was higher in pi starved plants and was observed after d of treatment . having established that no changes in gene _PROTEIN_ were observed in the catalytic subunits during pi starvation to explain the reduction in activity we analyzed the protein levels . transgenic arabidopsis plants carrying _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion proteins were evaluated . localization of _METHOD_ fusion proteins by confocal microscopy showed that both catalytic subunits colocalized with the chlorophyll suggesting a chloroplast localization . in the case of _PROTEIN_ a low but detectable signal was also observed in the cytoplasm . to confirm the localization of the catalytic subunits we raised polyclonal antibodies using a polypeptide that recognized _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ to detect the subunits in root and leaf sections . immunolocalization analysis indicated that the catalytic subunits are present in both organs . in leaf cells the catalytic subunits are localized in the chloroplast but the signal was also detected in the cytoplasm . in roots the catalytic subunits were present in all cells from the epidermis to the vascular tissue . to probe the chloroplast localization of the catalytic subunits at the biochemical level proteins obtained from purified chloroplasts were separated with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and transferred to a nitrocellulose _LOCATION_ . western blot analysis identified a polypeptide band around kd which is the expected molecular _METHOD_ for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . the same blot was probed with rubisco antibodies . under pi starvation conditions the detection of _METHOD_ fusion proteins showed no important changes in _PROTEIN_ . interestingly the _METHOD_ corresponding to _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ almost completely disappeared . this reduction in the _METHOD_ corresponding to one of the catalytic subunits was also observed in the leaf and root sections of pi starved plants visualized using the anti antibody . in leaf cells the amount of the catalytic subunits _PROTEIN_ notably since the chlorophyll signal was more intense than the alexa signal . in roots the catalytic subunits were confined to the surrounding vascular tissue and the signal in the cortex and epidermis disappeared . in addition the activity of in transgenic plants overexpressing _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ growing in pi starvation conditions was higher than in plants growing in pi sufficient conditions whereas in _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ plants pi starvation reduced activity . the determination of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ levels in transgenic plants using anti _METHOD_ antibodies showed no changes in _PROTEIN_ and a significant reduction in _PROTEIN_ during pi starvation . these results strongly suggest a differential regulation of both catalytic subunits under this nutritional condition . since no changes in protein levels for _PROTEIN_ were found the increase in its activity might be explained by a posttranslational modification . activation by phosphorylation of the thr present at the t loop was evaluated using an antibody that recognized the mammalian phosphorylated thr . the results showed that plants growing in pi starvation had the same level of phosphorylated _PROTEIN_ than plants growing in pi sufficient conditions indicating that additional _METHOD_ are activating the _PROTEIN_ complexes . the results presented so far suggest that complexes are formed with the _PROTEIN_ catalytic subunit under pi starvation . to better understand the role of _PROTEIN_ during pi starvation a t dna insertion line in _PROTEIN_ was identified and characterized . in addition rt pcr using gene specific primers indicated that no _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was found in the mutant . actin and _PROTEIN_ were _PROTEIN_ in both the wild type and mutant lines . when the presence of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ was evaluated by western blot using two dimensional _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was observed only in the wild type whereas _PROTEIN_ was identified in both wild type and mutant plants . no differences in activity were observed in the wild type and mutant plants growing in pi sufficient conditions . however activity _PROTEIN_ more in the mutant than in the wild type plants when they were grown in pi starvation conditions . in plants is directly involved in the regulation of _PROTEIN_ metabolism . antisense _PROTEIN_ of in barley produces pollen with no starch and arrests at the binucleate state of development . in arabidopsis starch degradation was impaired in a transient _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant . during pi starvation starch accumulation in leaves is one of the most consistently observed biochemical responses . to determine if _PROTEIN_ has a regulatory role in starch metabolism the amount of starch was measured in wild type and mutant plants . there was no difference in the starch levels between plants growing in pi sufficient conditions . however starch accumulation was higher in the mutant than in the wild type plants during phosphate starvation . to determine if starch mobilization was affected plants were incubated with and the distribution of the label was analyzed . the differences between the labels associated with the starch granules at the end of the day and at the end of the night are indications of starch mobilization . the results showed that less mobilization occurred in _PROTEIN_ during pi starvation than in the wild type . it has been demonstrated that also regulates gene _PROTEIN_ . to determine if _PROTEIN_ mutants also had a transcriptional effect during pi starvation we did a microarray analysis to identify genes that could be regulated by . we evaluated the transcript accumulation of some genes that had changed levels of _PROTEIN_ . the results showed that some of these genes which are directly involved in _PROTEIN_ metabolism increased transcript levels in mutant plants grown under pi starvation . in contrast other genes related to general stress were down regulated .
