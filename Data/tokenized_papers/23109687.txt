potassium is an essential macronutrient for plant growth and development . previous studies have demonstrated that calcineurin b like _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ interacting protein _PROTEIN_ regulate k uptake in arabidopsis roots by modulating k channel arabidopsis k . in this study we show that the protein kinase _PROTEIN_ interacts with the calcium sensor _PROTEIN_ and plays crucial roles in k homeostasis under low k stress in arabidopsis . arabidopsis wild type plants showed leaf chlorotic _METHOD_ when grown for d on low k medium . here we show that plants lacking _PROTEIN_ displayed a tolerant phenotype to low k stress which still _PROTEIN_ green leaves when the wild type plants showed typical k deficient _METHOD_ . overexpressing lines of _PROTEIN_ resulted in a low k sensitive phenotype compared with wild type plants . furthermore _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were identified as upstream regulators of _PROTEIN_ . both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ overexpressing lines displayed similar low k sensitive phenotypes and k contents to _PROTEIN_ overexpressing lines . however only _PROTEIN_ mutant plants but not _PROTEIN_ mutant plants showed the low k tolerant phenotype similar to _PROTEIN_ mutants . taken together these results demonstrate that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ work together and function in k homeostasis under low k stress in arabidopsis .
it has been reported that the _PROTEIN_ as an important positive regulator of _PROTEIN_ is involved in k uptake in arabidopsis roots . since _PROTEIN_ is the most similar homolog to _PROTEIN_ in this gene family it is hypothesized that _PROTEIN_ might be also involved in k uptake or k homeostasis in arabidopsis particularly under lk stress . to test this hypothesis the transfer dna insertion mutants of _PROTEIN_ including _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were used to determine their k related phenotypes under lk conditions . the t dna insertion sites of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are located in the fourth exon _PROTEIN_ and the intron _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ gene respectively . northern blot analysis confirmed that the transcription of _PROTEIN_ in these two mutant lines was disrupted . the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants did not show any significant difference from the wild type plants under normal growth condition _METHOD_ but they were more tolerant to lk stress compared with wild type plants . as shown in figure when the leaves of _PROTEIN_ mutants remained green after growth on lk medium for d the leaves of wild type plants had become chlorotic . to test whether the lk tolerant phenotype of the _PROTEIN_ mutants resulted from loss of function of _PROTEIN_ the complementation lines of _PROTEIN_ were constructed . the coding sequence of _PROTEIN_ following its own promoter was transformed into the _PROTEIN_ mutant plants . two independent complementation lines of _PROTEIN_ were obtained . the transcriptional _PROTEIN_ levels of _PROTEIN_ in these two complementation lines were both resumed . the phenotype test showed that both these two complementation lines displayed a similar phenotype to wild type plants when they were grown on lk medium for d . these results demonstrated that the lk tolerant phenotype of _PROTEIN_ mutants was caused by the disruption of _PROTEIN_ . in addition the k content of various plants _PROTEIN_ was measured after they were grown on _METHOD_ or lk medium for d. under lk conditions _PROTEIN_ mutant plants accumulated more k in shoot tissues than wild type plants while the shoot k content of the two complementation lines was similar to that of the wild type . we observed no difference in k content among all these plants grown on _METHOD_ medium . the results of k content measurements suggest that the lk tolerant phenotype of _PROTEIN_ mutants may result from the greater k accumulation in the shoots of mutants under lk conditions . it has been reported that the activities of cipks are regulated by binding one or more _PROTEIN_ proteins . to identify _PROTEIN_ that interact with _PROTEIN_ yeast two hybrid assays were applied to analyze the interaction between _PROTEIN_ and each member of _PROTEIN_ family from arabidopsis . the results demonstrated that seven _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ to _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ displayed interaction with _PROTEIN_ . quantitative galactosidase activity assays showed that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ had the strongest interaction with _PROTEIN_ among these seven _PROTEIN_ . to verify the interaction between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ in planta protein pull down assays were performed . in these assays glutathione s transferase _PROTEIN_ tagged _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ was used to pull down interacting proteins from the total proteins that were extracted from cmyc _PROTEIN_ transformed plants or wild type plants . the cmyc antibody was used to detect cmyc _PROTEIN_ fusion proteins via immunoblotting . the results of pull down assays showed that cmyc _PROTEIN_ proteins could be pulled down by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ indicating the interaction between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ in planta . the _PROTEIN_ profiles of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were investigated by detecting gus activity in transgenic arabidopsis seedlings that carried the gus gene under the control of their own promoters . the gus staining analysis showed that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were broadly _PROTEIN_ in whole seedlings at various developmental stages . in root tissue gus activities in all transgenic seedlings were detectable especially abundant in the vascular bundles . however compared with _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ could not be detected in the root tip of d old seedlings . in shoot tissue all of them were _PROTEIN_ in whole leaves particularly in the vascular tissue and hydathode . these results showed that the _PROTEIN_ profiles of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ exhibited a remarkable overlap in most of the plant tissue suggesting that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ may function together with _PROTEIN_ in vivo . to test the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in plant cells the fusion genes _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were constructed and introduced into tobacco leaves . the leaves _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ alone were used as controls . the results showed that the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein displayed nonspecific subcellular localization . in addition to observation of the _METHOD_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ at the tonoplast the _METHOD_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was also observed to encircle the whole epidermal cell indicating that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ might also localize at the pm . to confirm this notion the pm marker protein _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and the tonoplast marker protein _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were applied . when _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was coexpressed with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in tobacco leaves the green _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and the red _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ showed an obvious overlap . moreover the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ green _METHOD_ and the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ red _METHOD_ were perfectly matched indicating the colocalization of the two proteins . these results demonstrated that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ may locate at both the pm and tonoplast . to investigate the interaction between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ bimolecular _METHOD_ complementation assays in tobacco leaves was performed . _PROTEIN_ was cloned into the split yellow _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ vector pspyne and _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ was constructed into pspyce vector . the paired combinations of yn _PROTEIN_ and yc _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ together with pm marker protein _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or the tonoplast marker protein _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were cotransformed into the tobacco leaves . the epidermal cells _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ complex or _PROTEIN_ complex showed the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ signal at the pm and tonoplast . moreover the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ overlapped with the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ demonstrating that _PROTEIN_ could interact with _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ at the pm and tonoplast in tobacco leaves . the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ proteins was further confirmed in arabidopsis mesophyll protoplasts . _METHOD_ fusion proteins of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were constructed and introduced into arabidopsis mesophyll protoplasts . the results showed that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ did not exhibit specific localization . the _METHOD_ of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein was _PROTEIN_ localized at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . to clarify the _LOCATION_ identity the transformed protoplasts were treated with hypoosmotic solution in order to release the _LOCATION_ . after disruption of the protoplasts _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ _METHOD_ disappeared . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was still observed at the tonoplast after the protoplasts were disrupted suggesting the tonoplast localization of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . for the bifc assays in arabidopsis mesophyll protoplasts _PROTEIN_ was cloned into the split _METHOD_ vector puc _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ was fused to puc _PROTEIN_ . different combinations were cotransformed into arabidopsis mesophyll protoplasts . in the protoplasts _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ complex or _PROTEIN_ complex the _METHOD_ signal was detected at the tonoplast . in addition the _LOCATION_ were released by the hypoosmotic treatment and the _METHOD_ was still observed at the tonoplast . these results suggested that _PROTEIN_ interacted with _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ at the tonoplast in arabidopsis . to test the hypothesis that _PROTEIN_ and/or _PROTEIN_ may play roles in plant responses to lk stress by interacting with _PROTEIN_ the phenotypes and k contents of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ overexpressing plants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ as well as mutant plants under lk conditions were analyzed . the elevated transcriptional _PROTEIN_ of the genes _PROTEIN_ oe _PROTEIN_ oe and _PROTEIN_ oe were verified by northern blot . the phenotype test showed that all overexpressing plants exhibited more sensitive phenotypes under lk conditions . this sensitive phenotype was dependent on the k concentrations but not on concentrations in the medium . to quantify the lk sensitive phenotype the chlorophyll a and b contents of these overexpressing plants and wild type plants were tested . the results showed that chlorophyll contents of all the overexpressing plants were much lower than those of wild type plants under lk conditions . in addition the k contents in all three overexpressing plants were _PROTEIN_ compared with wild type plants especially under lk conditions . these results further confirmed the lk sensitive phenotype of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ overexpressing plants . the t dna insertion mutants _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were tested for their phenotypes under lk treatment . interestingly _PROTEIN_ mutant plants exhibited a different phenotype from _PROTEIN_ mutant plants under lk treatment although _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ proteins showed high similarity in their amino acid sequences and both interacted with _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ mutant plants showed a similar lk tolerant phenotype to _PROTEIN_ mutants whose shoots remained green after growth on lk medium for d whereas the _PROTEIN_ mutant plants and wild type plants showed similar chlorotic _METHOD_ . moreover this tolerant phenotype of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants was also dependent on the k concentrations but not on concentrations in the medium . the results of chlorophyll content measurements showed that the chlorophyll a contents in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutant plants were much higher than that in wild type plants under lk conditions which was consistent with their lk tolerant phenotype . the k contents in shoots of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants were much higher than those of wild type and _PROTEIN_ mutant plants after growth on lk medium for d . all these results derived from phenotype tests and k content measurements indicated that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ might work together in vivo and play crucial roles in k homeostasis in arabidopsis under lk conditions . although _PROTEIN_ can physically interact with _PROTEIN_ it may not functionally regulate _PROTEIN_ activity . furthermore it is notable that the k content in _PROTEIN_ roots was much higher than that of any other plants which suggested that _PROTEIN_ might also regulate other components involved in k uptake in arabidopsis roots at the same time .
