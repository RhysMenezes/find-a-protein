arginine is an essential amino acid necessary for protein synthesis and is also a nitrogen storage compound . the genes encoding the enzymes of arginine biosynthesis in plants are not well characterized and have _PROTEIN_ been predicted from homologies to bacterial and fungal genes . we report the cloning and characterization of the tumor _PROTEIN_ gene of arabidopsis encoding an acetylornithine aminotransferase catalyzing the fourth step of arginine biosynthesis . the free arginine content was strongly reduced in the chemically induced recessive mutant _PROTEIN_ root growth was restored by supplementation with arginine and its metabolic precursors and a yeast acoat mutant was complemented by _PROTEIN_ . two null alleles of _PROTEIN_ caused a reduced viability of gametes and embryo lethality possibly caused by insufficient arg supply from maternal tissue . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is positively regulated by light and a _PROTEIN_ green _METHOD_ protein was localized in chloroplasts . _PROTEIN_ has a unique light dependent short root phenotype . roots of light grown _PROTEIN_ seedlings switch from indeterminate growth to determinate growth with arresting cell production and an exhausted root apical meristem . the inhibitory activity was specific for blue light and the inhibiting light was perceived by the root . thus _PROTEIN_ reveals a novel role of amino acids and blue light in regulating root meristem function .
initially _PROTEIN_ was found in a screen for mutants that react with higher sensitivity than the wild type to the phytohormones auxin and cytokinin by the formation of tumorous tissue . the recessive ethyl methanesulfonate mutant _PROTEIN_ formed calli on hypocotyl and root explants when grown on medium containing low concentrations of the auxin naphthylacetic acid and the cytokinin isopentenyl adenine which were not effective in the wild type . mutant seedlings had a very short root when grown in vitro in light and growth arrested root primordia formed callus like structures at the hypocotyl/root junction . the shoot of in vitro grown _PROTEIN_ plants was also impaired probably due to the root growth arrest . in contrast the shoots of soil grown _PROTEIN_ mutants were morphologically similar to the wild type flowered only approximately d _PROTEIN_ and formed a normal root system . this result indicated a potential role of light in inducing root growth inhibition in the _PROTEIN_ mutants which will be explored further below . the _PROTEIN_ mutation was located on the lower arm of chromosome i close to the telomere by marker assisted gene mapping . no recombinants were found to further reduce the mapping interval of kb containing predicted genes . therefore to kb large subclones containing one to five predicted genes were generated from the two bac clones and covering the _PROTEIN_ mapping interval . these subclones were then transformed into _PROTEIN_ plants to screen for root phenotype complementation . three complementing bac subclones contained only one predicted gene _GENE_ in their common region . the _PROTEIN_ allele showed as a single point mutation a transition from g to a in the third exon of _GENE_ at base number of the unspliced sequence leading to an altered amino acid sequence of the predicted protein _PROTEIN_ . transformation of _PROTEIN_ plants with the complementary dna of _PROTEIN_ under control of the promoter complemented the root phenotype demonstrating that the mutation in _GENE_ caused the _PROTEIN_ phenotype . protein sequence analysis identified _PROTEIN_ as a putative acoat . the protein is predicted to have a length of amino acids and a mr of . the enzyme catalyzes the transfer of an amino group from l glu to acetyl l glu semialdehyde yielding ketoglutarate and acetyl orn using pyridoxal p as a cofactor . the synthesis of acetyl orn is the fourth step in de novo arg biosynthesis . proteins with high sequence similarity to _PROTEIN_ are encoded by bacteria fungi and plants . a sequence alignment with different known and putative acoats showed that the amino acid mutated in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was conserved in all enzymes from bacteria to higher plants indicating that it is functionally relevant . however in silico analyses using different structure prediction _METHOD_ have not been informative about the possible impact of the mutation on protein structure and catalytic activity . the phylogenetic relationships of the seven aligned proteins correspond to the relationships between the source _METHOD_ . _PROTEIN_ of arabidopsis is closely related to the populus trichocarpa protein and farthest related to the bacterial and fungal acoat . _PROTEIN_ is probably impaired in the biosynthesis of the amino acids that are produced downstream of the acoat enzymatic reaction in the arg biosynthetic pathway . consistent with this assumption it has been possible to complement the short root phenotype of _PROTEIN_ by supplementation of the medium with acetyl orn l orn l cit and l arg . a number of other metabolites linked to arg biosynthesis including different polyamines and the nitric oxide donor sodium nitroprusside were not effective in restoring the _PROTEIN_ root phenotype indicating that the mutant phenotype is specifically linked to arg biosynthesis . to test whether _PROTEIN_ has the predicted function as an acoat we examined its ability to restore arg autotrophy in the acoat deficient yeast mutant strain . for this purpose the genomic arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ sequence and the _PROTEIN_ cdna were cloned downstream of the strong constitutive promoter of the translation elongation _PROTEIN_ gene in yeast vector . the yeast mutant transformed with the empty vector or the same vector containing the genomic _PROTEIN_ sequence were unable to grow on medium lacking arg . in contrast the yeast mutant _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ cdna became arg autotrophic thus confirming the function of _PROTEIN_ as an acoat . we measured the content of arg and other amino acids and compared it with the wild type content to analyze the consequences of the apparent block in arg biosynthesis in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . the content of free arg in _PROTEIN_ seedlings grown in vitro under long day conditions was lowered to of that of the wild type . additional measurements in seedlings of different age consistently showed a reduction of arg content between and in _PROTEIN_ . in contrast no difference in arg content was found between _PROTEIN_ and the wild type grown in darkness . dark grown seedlings of both genotypes showed a strong _PROTEIN_ of their arg content . the distribution of free arg between root and shoot was unequal . wild type roots contained about times less arg than wild type shoots . this was the most extreme difference in shoot/root distribution of all amino acids analyzed . the arg content of _PROTEIN_ shoots was approximately of that of wild type shoots which is similar to the difference found in whole seedlings . we analyzed the content of different amino acids to explore whether the disruption of arg biosynthesis also affects the level of other amino acids . out of these the level of amino acids was increased in d old seedlings . the strongest increases of up to approximately and compared with the wild type were found for gly and gln respectively . interestingly only asn and gln were increased in _PROTEIN_ in d old seedlings while the level of all other amino acids was comparable to the wild type except for arg which was again reduced . the _PROTEIN_ gene was fused at the end in frame to a _METHOD_ gene and positioned downstream of the promoter to determine the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ . the fusion gene complemented the _PROTEIN_ root phenotype indicating its functionality . the subcellular localization of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein was analyzed by confocal laser scanning microscopy in leaf protoplasts obtained from stably transformed lines in wild type background . the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signal colocalized with the _METHOD_ of chloroplasts indicating a chloroplastic localization . this is in good agreement with the database predictions of targetp and aramemnon . the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ was examined by quantitative real time reverse transcription pcr in different organs and under different light conditions . _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ in all organs tested . the highest _PROTEIN_ was found in rosette leaves and the lowest in roots . the ubiquitous _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ is consistent with the results of microarray analyses found in databases such as the _METHOD_ browser and genevestigator . the influence of white light on _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was then studied because _PROTEIN_ shows a light dependent root phenotype . seedlings were cultivated in standard conditions and then exposed to light or darkness for h. the _PROTEIN_ level of _PROTEIN_ in light exposed seedlings was times higher than in dark exposed seedlings . we analyzed the consequences of lower and higher _PROTEIN_ gene _PROTEIN_ to gain a better understanding of the role of _PROTEIN_ . loss of function analysis was carried out with two t dna insertion alleles of the salk collection named _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . sequencing confirmed the sites of both insertions within the third exon of the _PROTEIN_ gene . populations of heterozygous self fertilized parents of both lines were screened by pcr for homozygous progeny but no homozygous line was found among plants tested for _PROTEIN_ and plants tested for _PROTEIN_ . this indicated that the homozygous state might be lethal for both alleles . inspection of cleared siliques of heterozygous _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ plants revealed empty spaces between seeds indicating premature termination of seed development . microscopy examination showed that these spaces in the siliques contained aborted ovules or very small embryos . the percentage of abortion was about in _PROTEIN_ and in _PROTEIN_ while in the wild type and _PROTEIN_ only to of abortion was found . in addition a meiotic drift was found in the generation of heterozygous self fertilized _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ lines . according to mendel s laws the ratio between wild type and heterozygous plants should be . only of the plants in _PROTEIN_ and in _PROTEIN_ were heterozygous for mutated _PROTEIN_ allele . all other plants contained the _PROTEIN_ allele combination . because of this strong underrepresentation of the t dna insertion alleles in the segregating progeny the ratio between wild type and heterozygous plants was in _PROTEIN_ progeny and in _PROTEIN_ progeny . reciprocal crosses of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ heterozygous plants with the wild type were carried out to find out whether embryo development pollen and/or ovule fertility were impaired . pcr analysis of progenies showed that the t dna insertion allele was transmitted by both pollen and ovule . however the transmission frequency in both cases was reduced instead of only approximately to _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ of the generation carried the t dna insertion alleles indicating that the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ alleles reduce male and female gametophytic fitness leading to meiotic drift . in addition the low t dna allele frequency in the self fertilized _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ lines and in the reciprocal crosses suggests an impairment of embryo development even in a heterozygous state . taken together null mutation of the _PROTEIN_ gene impairs gametophytic fitness and is lethal at early stages of embryo development . plants overexpressing _PROTEIN_ were produced by transformation of the wild type with the _PROTEIN_ gene used previously for complementation to test the consequences of increased _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ overexpression in the wild type caused two visible morphological changes interveinal chlorosis in cauline leaves and the formation of wrinkled bumpy siliques . interestingly the arg level was not increased above the wild type in cultivated _PROTEIN_ lines in vitro . as described above the root phenotype of _PROTEIN_ mutants differed when plants were grown in vitro or on soil . the roots of _PROTEIN_ seedlings grown on murashige and skoog _METHOD_ medium in short day conditions grew longer than the roots of _PROTEIN_ seedlings cultivated under long day conditions . this indicated that day length and therefore light influenced root growth and not a component of the growth medium . the roots of _PROTEIN_ seedlings of different ages cultivated in darkness consistently immediately stopped growth when they were shifted into light . microscopy analysis of the root tips of light grown _PROTEIN_ plants revealed that the meristem had lost its organized structure the cells had differentiated and starch granules were absent in the columella cells . in contrast dark grown _PROTEIN_ seedlings had a root meristem similar to that of the wild type . root growth of _PROTEIN_ was tested under various monochromatic light qualities to find out whether a specific part of the light spectrum causes this switch from an indeterminate growth to determinate growth . the inhibition of root growth in _PROTEIN_ was induced by blue light but not by red or far red light . the root growth inhibition caused by blue light was dose dependent . the root length was not significantly different between _PROTEIN_ and the wild type up to while a blue light intensity of or more inhibited root elongation in _PROTEIN_ . to test whether a known light signaling pathway is involved in mediating this effect we combined by crossing _PROTEIN_ with the following light receptor or light signaling mutants the phytochrome apoprotein mutant _PROTEIN_ the phytochrome chromophore biosynthesis mutant the cryptochrome apoprotein mutant _PROTEIN_ and the _PROTEIN_ transcription _PROTEIN_ mutant . analysis of the double mutants in the generation showed that none of these mutants suppressed the _PROTEIN_ root phenotype . therefore the light receptors or light signaling _PROTEIN_ analyzed are not epistatic to _PROTEIN_ . wild type and _PROTEIN_ plants were grown in vitro in glass tubes with illumination of the whole plant or illumination of only the shoot to find out whether the perception of the inhibiting light takes place in the shoot or in the root . when grown in light _PROTEIN_ exhibited its typical severe root growth defect . in contrast when only the shoots were illuminated the root length of _PROTEIN_ increased significantly . although _PROTEIN_ roots did not reach the length of wild type roots which was probably due to the imperfect darkening of the roots in the experimental setup it can be concluded that the root itself perceives the inhibiting light signal causing the _PROTEIN_ root phenotype . we studied the cell cycle marker gene _PROTEIN_ gus dbox and _PROTEIN_ which specifically marks the quiescent center _PROTEIN_ in the _PROTEIN_ background to follow more closely the light dependent switch to determinate growth and the subsequent loss of the root meristem . the meristem of _PROTEIN_ roots grown in vitro in light showed a strongly reduced cell cycle dependent gus activity compared with the wild type . a weak signal was visible in only a few cells . the _PROTEIN_ dependent gus activity was reduced in light grown roots of _PROTEIN_ . when the meristematic structure was not yet completely lost a light blue color showed a _PROTEIN_ gus activity in the _PROTEIN_ cells . the shape of the _PROTEIN_ cells was also changed in _PROTEIN_ while the cells were flattened in the wild type meristem they stretched parallel to the root axis in _PROTEIN_ . when the loss of meristematic structure progressed the gus activity in the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ roots almost vanished . as _PROTEIN_ was found in a screen for callus formation on low concentrations of cytokinin and auxin we also examined the hormonal status in the differentiated _PROTEIN_ root meristem using the cytokinin sensitive marker _PROTEIN_ gus and the auxin reporter gus . the gus activity pattern in both cases was much weaker in _PROTEIN_ than in the wild type or had almost vanished in the mutant root . nevertheless gus _PROTEIN_ marking in pericycle cells at the beginning of _PROTEIN_ root primordia formation was also observed in the short growth arrested _PROTEIN_ primary roots .
_PROTEIN_ was isolated from an ethyl methanesulfonate mutagenized population of arabidopsis ecotype columbia glabra . the t dna insertional mutants _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and the light signaling pathway mutants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and were obtained from the nottingham arabidopsis stock center and the arabidopsis biological resource center . _PROTEIN_ was combined by crossing with the marker gene lines _PROTEIN_ gus dbox _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ gus and gus provided by peter doerner sabrina sabatini and joe kieber respectively . unless stated otherwise plants were grown at under long day conditions on soil in a greenhouse or in vitro in a growth chamber . in vitro cultivation was on solid medium containing _METHOD_ salts g myo inositol g mes mg thiamine mg nicotinic acid mg pyridoxine

done with approximately homozygous mutant plants of the generation as described by citation . no more recombinants were found at a mapping interval of kb . therefore dna fragments of the two bac

_PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . the resulting pcr product was used as a template to add bp of gateway attachment sites at the ends with the primers aaaaagcaggctatggcgtctcttagccaaatc and _PROTEIN_ . finally the full length attachment sites were added in a pcr reaction with the primers ggggacaagtttgtacaaaaaagcaggct and ggggaccactttgtacaagaaagctgggt . the resulting pcr product was inserted into the donor vector via recombination to create an entry clone for further use . the resulting entry clone was recombined with which inserts the _PROTEIN_ gene between the promoter and the _METHOD_ gene creating the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion . the resulting plasmids were transformed into agrobacterium tumefaciens strain which was used for arabidopsis transformation . transformants were selected on medium containing the appropriate antibiotics . the yeast strain with the accession number _PROTEIN_ in which the acoat gene is deleted was provided by euroscarf . the genomic sequence and the cdna of _PROTEIN_ were amplified with the primers cgggatccatggcgtctcttagccaaatc and acgcgtcgactcaatcaagcgcagtcaaat generating a bamhi restriction site at the end and a sali restriction site at the end for plasmid construction . the pcr products were inserted into the yeast vector by directional cloning using the bamhi and sali sites . the resulting plasmid was transformed into by the lithium acetate
