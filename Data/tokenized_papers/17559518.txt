the arabidopsis atmtp family of genes encode proteins of the cation diffusion facilitator family with several members having roles in metal tolerances . four of the proteins in the family form a distinct cluster on a phylogenetic tree and are closely related to a cdf identified in the tropical legume stylosanthes hamata that is implicated in the transport of into the _LOCATION_ as a tolerance mechanism . of these four genes _PROTEIN_ was the most highly _PROTEIN_ member of the arabidopsis subgroup . when _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ in saccharomyces cerevisiae it conferred tolerance and transported by a proton antiport mechanism . a mutant of arabidopsis with a disrupted _PROTEIN_ gene _PROTEIN_ was found to have increased sensitivity to but not to or . at a non toxic but sufficient supply the mutant accumulated more than the wild type but did not show any obvious deleterious effects on growth . when grown with supplies that ranged from basal to toxic the mutant accumulated concentrations in shoots similar to those in wild type plants despite showing _METHOD_ of toxicity . _PROTEIN_ fused to green _METHOD_ protein co localized with a reporter specific for pre _LOCATION_ compartments . these findings provide evidence for specific transport activity by _PROTEIN_ and implicate the pre _LOCATION_ compartments in both tolerance and homeostasis _METHOD_ of arabidopsis .
the _PROTEIN_ of the four atmtp genes most similar to was assessed in whole seedlings of wild type arabidopsis grown with a range of supplies . of the four genes in this group _PROTEIN_ showed the greatest _PROTEIN_ level having about sevenfold greater _PROTEIN_ than both and _PROTEIN_ and about fold greater _PROTEIN_ than . the _PROTEIN_ of all four genes was little affected by supplies that ranged from basal to severely toxic . as _PROTEIN_ had the greatest _PROTEIN_ level the function of this gene was characterized further . a cdna for the complete coding region of _PROTEIN_ was amplified by pcr and cloned into the yeast _PROTEIN_ vector . the metal tolerances of the yeast strain transformed with _PROTEIN_ either _PROTEIN_ or were compared with control yeast transformed with the empty vector . was included as a positive control as it has been shown previously to confer tolerance when _PROTEIN_ in yeast . both cdnas conferred enhanced tolerance to the yeast when grown in liquid culture with conferring a greater level of tolerance . when grown in liquid medium supplemented with sub toxic yeast _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ accumulated similar levels of to the control strain . on solid medium both cdnas also conferred tolerance to the yeast with again conferring a greater level of tolerance than _PROTEIN_ . although neither _PROTEIN_ nor conferred increased tolerance to a range of other metals including or both genes conferred tolerance to although the increase in tolerance was relatively small when compared with the increase in tolerance . the relative sensitivities of various knock out mutants in the yeast strain have been described . the mutant most sensitive to is and its growth was severely affected across a range of concentrations that only marginally affected growth of the control strain . as the mutant is unable to grow to the same density as the control at saturation the effect of on the two strains was assessed when both strains had attained similar densities with a basal supply . under these conditions _PROTEIN_ conferred clear tolerance to the mutant across a range of concentrations whereas when _PROTEIN_ in the control strain _PROTEIN_ did not enhance tolerance . to determine whether the tolerance phenotype of the yeast strain _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or was due to transport that required a proton gradient the transport activity of _LOCATION_ vesicles was assayed . a proton gradient was established across the _LOCATION_ by energization of the h _PROTEIN_ and acridine orange _METHOD_ used to monitor the ph inside the vesicles . addition of dissipated the proton gradient more rapidly in vesicles prepared from yeast _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or than in vesicles prepared from the control strain consistent with both proteins acting as /proton antiporters . by contrast when either or was added the proton gradient was dissipated at the same rate in vesicles prepared from control and from and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ yeast strains . all three metal ions elicited _METHOD_ recovery when added to the vesicles prepared from control yeast which was presumably due to background activities of endogenous yeast cation/proton antiporters . the _METHOD_ recovery was unlikely to have been due to dissipation of the proton gradient caused by leaky _LOCATION_ vesicles because the addition of water alone instead of metal ions failed to elicit recovery of _METHOD_ . furthermore addition of the protonophore _PROTEIN_ cyanide p trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone or the detergent triton x completely dissipated the proton gradient causing _METHOD_ recovery of a much greater magnitude than that elicited by the addition of any of the metal salts . a homozygous mutant line of arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ that had the _PROTEIN_ coding region interrupted by a t dna insert was compared with a homozygous sibling line that lacked the t dna insert . analysis confirmed that _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ was significantly reduced in the mutant whereas the _PROTEIN_ levels of the other three related genes remained similar to wild type . the _PROTEIN_ mutant was visually indistinguishable from wild type when grown in potting mix . however when grown on nutrient agar with a basal supply of the _PROTEIN_ mutant accumulated more in shoots and roots than the wild type whereas the concentrations of other mineral nutrients did not differ between the lines . on nutrient agar supplied with concentrations that ranged from basal to toxic levels _PROTEIN_ was more sensitive to than the wild type as determined by significantly reduced shoot dry weights . analysis of in shoots showed that both wild type and mutant accumulated similar concentrations at the various supplies despite the differences in growth . concentrations _PROTEIN_ on a dry weight basis . to verify that the phenotypes associated with the _PROTEIN_ mutant were due to reduced _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ wild type plants were transformed with an rnai transgene that targeted _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in two independent transgenic lines was reduced compared with wild type with a corresponding increased sensitivity and greater accumulation at basal supply for both lines . the _PROTEIN_ mutant and wild type were grown in media without added to determine if a phenotype was apparent when deficient . although both genotypes had reduced growth in the absence of which was indicative of deficiency the mutant was affected similarly to the wild type . the ability of the _PROTEIN_ mutant to tolerate and was also assessed in view of the small increase in tolerance conferred by _PROTEIN_ when _PROTEIN_ in yeast and the observation that other cdf proteins confer increased tolerance when overexpressed in arabidopsis . however in contrast to the _PROTEIN_ mutant showed the same level of tolerance to both and as the wild type control . to determine whether _PROTEIN_ is able to complement the _PROTEIN_ mutant and to establish the subcellular location of _PROTEIN_ a sequence encoding _METHOD_ was fused in frame to the end of the _PROTEIN_ cdna that lacked a stop codon . _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in the _PROTEIN_ mutant of arabidopsis enhanced tolerance and reduced the concentration of shoots and roots at basal supply in the generation of two independently transformed lines . similarly root growth of the _PROTEIN_ mutant which was suppressed at mm was also alleviated by _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . as observed for shoots concentrations in roots at mm supply were similar for wild type _PROTEIN_ mutant and _PROTEIN_ mutant _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . enhanced tolerance and reduced shoot concentration were also observed in the generation of a third independently transformed line but when a homozygous line was derived from this line _PROTEIN_ was silenced . this coincided with loss of tolerance and increased concentrations in tissues thus providing additional evidence for the association of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ with the tolerance and homeostasis phenotypes . despite detectable _PROTEIN_ and partial complementation of the _PROTEIN_ mutant by transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ in these plants was very low suggesting that the _METHOD_ signal had been degraded . to study the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ we generated _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and transiently _PROTEIN_ them in both tobacco by protoplasts and intact leek cells . both _METHOD_ used for transient _PROTEIN_ showed numerous small _METHOD_ motile structures . their identity was confirmed to be pre _LOCATION_ compartments by co localization with specific markers for these organelles and by the effects of pharmacological reagents on their morphology . when transiently _PROTEIN_ in tobacco protoplasts together with either a pvc or a _LOCATION_ marker most _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signals co localized with the pvc marker _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ but were largely separate from the _LOCATION_ marker _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . the n terminal construct _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ also co localized with the pvc marker _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ but not with the _LOCATION_ marker _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . thus both _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusions localized to the _LOCATION_ sorting receptor marked pvcs in transgenic tobacco by cells . similarly in leek cells transiently _PROTEIN_ the constructs _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was seen in organelles which were very similar to pvcs and did not co localize with _PROTEIN_ dsred a _LOCATION_ specific reporter . when leek cells were treated with wortmannin for h the organelles labelled with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ became less motile and in many cases displayed a vacuolated morphology whereas _LOCATION_ vesicles showed no change in response to wortmannin . treatment with brefeldin a did not alter the morphology of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ organelles but did cause them to aggregate whereas _LOCATION_ vesicles became swollen . longer treatment with bfa caused _PROTEIN_ dsred _METHOD_ to appear in _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ like structures with abnormal morphology and the organelles labelled with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ to accumulate in large aggregates . in contrast to _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ seedlings stably transformed with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ showed clear _METHOD_ _METHOD_ in punctuate structures similar to those seen in transient _PROTEIN_ and the sensitive phenotype was also complemented .
yeast was grown by liquid and agar cultures using complete synthetic medium supplemented with amino acids as described by citation and plasmids extracted from yeast transformed by the procedure described by citation were amplified in escherichia coli . galactose at was included in the growth medium to induce _PROTEIN_ of genes in yeast that were under the control of the _PROTEIN_ promoter of the plasmid . for the yeast strain only supplemental his was required for growth of transformed cultures . the and mutants in the diploid strain _PROTEIN_ were grown in synthetic complete medium and supplemented with his lys leu trp and adenine . in the absence of the wild type strain an mutant of this strain grown in medium that contained adenine was used as a control for the mutant . assays for

protein in plants _METHOD_ was digested with kpni and xbai and the fragment that contained _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was inserted into the kpni and xbai sites of the _PROTEIN_ cassette to yield _METHOD_ . digestion of _METHOD_ with noti liberated a fragment that contained _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ flanked by the cauliflower mosaic virus promoter and ocs terminator . this fragment was inserted into the noti site of the binary vector to yield _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . to generate an n terminal fusion of _METHOD_ to _PROTEIN_ primer pair was used to amplify the _PROTEIN_ coding region from . the resulting product was digested with kpni and xbai and inserted into the corresponding sites of to yield . a _METHOD_ coding region was amplified from an _METHOD_ construct in using primer pair and the product

weighed and then digested at for approximately h in ml of a solution consisting of nine parts nitric acid and one part perchloric acid . after the temperature was increased to and the samples incubated for a further h the solution was cooled made up to ml with de ionized water then analysed by inductively coupled _LOCATION_ atomic emission spectrophotometry . yeast microsomal _LOCATION_ vesicles were prepared as described previously . the effect of metals on the proton gradient was determined by an acridine orange _METHOD_ quench assay performed essentially as described by citation . _LOCATION_ vesicles were added to a reaction buffer in a stirred cuvette containing mm mannitol mm hepes btp ph mm hcl btp ph mm sodium azide mm sodium orthovanadate and acridine orange incubated at . a proton gradient was generated by energization of the h _PROTEIN_ with the addition of mm _PROTEIN_ and mm . formation of the ph gradient was observed by monitoring the _METHOD_ quenching of acridine orange at excitation nm and emission nm using a spectrofluorimeter . after a steady state proton gradient was generated metal salts were added and _METHOD_ recovery was measured . for each metal assays were conducted in duplicate or triplicate on each of three independently prepared _LOCATION_ vesicles . tobacco by culture cells were _PROTEIN_ in _METHOD_ media as described previously . typically by cells were sub cultured twice a month in _METHOD_ agar media or twice a week in liquid _METHOD_ media . protoplasts were prepared from day old by cells via the following steps by cells
