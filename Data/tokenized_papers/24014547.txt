the centromeric histone variant _PROTEIN_ is an essential centromeric protein required for assembly _PROTEIN_ and proper function of kinetochores during mitosis and meiosis . we identified a kinetochore _PROTEIN_ homolog in arabidopsis thaliana and uncovered features of its role in _PROTEIN_ loading at centromeres . we show that arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ colocalizes with _PROTEIN_ and is associated with centromeres during all stages of the mitotic cell cycle except from metaphase to mid anaphase . _PROTEIN_ is regulated by the proteasome degradation pathway . the _PROTEIN_ promoter is _PROTEIN_ active in meristematic tissues similar to the _PROTEIN_ promoter . a knockout mutant for _PROTEIN_ shows a reduced level of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and reduced amount of _PROTEIN_ protein at chromocenters of meristematic _LOCATION_ anaphase bridges during mitosis micronuclei in pollen tetrads and seed abortion . moreover mutant plants display reduced _PROTEIN_ of suppressor of variegation and and reduced dna methylation suggesting an impact of _PROTEIN_ on the epigenetic environment for centromere _PROTEIN_ .
_PROTEIN_ homologs contain a conserved protein module of amino acids designated as the santa domain due to its association with the sant domain a protein domain present in chromatin remodeling enzymes such as histone acetyltransferase deacetylase n cor and transcription initiation _PROTEIN_ tfiiib . metazoan genomes have only one gene encoding a protein with santa domain but in representatives of higher plants two genes were identified . _GENE_ of arabidopsis encodes a amino acid protein containing a n terminal santa domain at position to . the second gene _GENE_ encodes a amino acid protein which has a santa domain a kinase interacting protein domain and a c terminal structural _PROTEIN_ of chromosomes bacterial type domain . among eukaryotes domain proteins are present exclusively in plants and are involved in signaling regulation through interaction with the kinase domain of _PROTEIN_ a receptor like kinase in plant pollen . as _GENE_ encodes a protein with the most typical features of known _PROTEIN_ like proteins we selected this gene for further analysis and named it _PROTEIN_ . in silico analysis of the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ gene structure revealed nine exons . to investigate the evolutionary relationship of arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ and its putative homologs in other plant species blast analysis of the conserved santa domain was performed . a multiple sequence alignment was generated using muscle _METHOD_ visualized by the jalview program and a phylogenetic tree for the conserved domains of _PROTEIN_ was constructed using the program . santa domain containing proteins were found in all _METHOD_ with sequenced genomes . in most plant genomes analyzed so far except for barley and maize we found two genes encoding santa domain proteins . to study the subcellular localization of arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ in vivo we constructed a fusion of _PROTEIN_ to enhanced yellow _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ . to that end the _PROTEIN_ cdna was cloned into the vector and subcloned into _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ vectors respectively . however no _METHOD_ specific signal could be found in stably transformed arabidopsis plants . because the n terminal part of _PROTEIN_ contains two putative ubiquitination sites according to the ubsite prediction program we assumed that the fusion protein is degraded via the proteasome degradation pathway . to test this assumption we treated seedlings of transformants with the protease inhibitor . inhibition of the proteasome degradation pathway resulted in pronounced _PROTEIN_ specific signals at centromeric chromocenters and in nucleoplasm or in the nucleoli and nucleoplasm . to find out whether the putative ubiquitination sites at the n terminus of _PROTEIN_ are indeed responsible for the proteolytic degradation cdnas comprising the n terminal part including the santa domain and the two putative ubiquitination sites or the c terminal part without these regions were separately fused to _METHOD_ . nicotiana benthamiana leaves were infiltrated with agrobacterium tumefaciens transformed with _PROTEIN_ n _PROTEIN_ c and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion constructs . in all cases _METHOD_ was detected in the nucleoplasm or in nucleoplasm nucleoli and _LOCATION_ bodies . however for the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ n _METHOD_ fusion constructs the number of _LOCATION_ showing _METHOD_ was very low _LOCATION_ . treatment of n. benthamiana leaf discs with protease inhibitor increased the number of _LOCATION_ with _METHOD_ . in contrast with the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ n constructs _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ c fused to _METHOD_ resulted in a high number of _LOCATION_ showing _METHOD_ without application of protease inhibitor . these data indicate that the level of _PROTEIN_ is regulated by the proteasome degradation pathway via ubiquitination at its n terminal part . since full length _PROTEIN_ and its n and c terminal parts fused with _METHOD_ showed the same localization pattern in transiently transformed n. benthamiana but the c terminus appeared to be more stable than other variants we generated arabidopsis plants stably _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ c or _PROTEIN_ c _METHOD_ fusion constructs to study localization and dynamics of _PROTEIN_ in vivo . n terminal as well as c terminal fusion of _PROTEIN_ c with _METHOD_ yielded no _METHOD_ during mitosis . interphase _LOCATION_ exhibited _METHOD_ signals at chromocenters and to a lesser degree in nucleoplasm even without application of a proteasome inhibitor . in differentiated root _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ c _METHOD_ was also present in the nucleolus . despite the absence of the putative dna binding domain _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ c was localized at chromocenters indicating that centromeric localization of arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ does not require a santa domain . to analyze the dynamics of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ c in root tips of arabidopsis transformants _METHOD_ loss in photobleaching and _METHOD_ recovery after photobleaching were applied . bleaching of a selected area within the nucleoplasm of _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ c in s intervals during min resulted in disappearance of _METHOD_ also in nonbleached areas of nucleoplasm chromocenters and the nucleolus . frap experiments showed that bleached _METHOD_ of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ c at chromocenters recovers to within s . both flip and frap experiments showed high turnover of _PROTEIN_ . flip additionally revealed a high mobility of _PROTEIN_ between centromeres nucleoplasm and nucleoli . to analyze the localization of endogenous _PROTEIN_ and to compare it with the localization of _PROTEIN_ fused to _METHOD_ antibodies against the c terminal part of _PROTEIN_ were generated . immunostaining of arabidopsis root tip _LOCATION_ with anti _PROTEIN_ antibodies revealed a similar localization pattern as observed in meristematic _LOCATION_ of transformants stably _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ c _METHOD_ or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ after treatment with protease inhibitor . no immunosignals were detected at centromeres during mitosis . finally double immunostaining experiments of arabidopsis _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ transformants with anti green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ and anti _PROTEIN_ antibodies confirmed the centromeric position of _PROTEIN_ in meristematic interphase _LOCATION_ . to test whether the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ promoter _PROTEIN_ is active in diving tissues similar to _PROTEIN_ transgenic lines _PROTEIN_ a _METHOD_ gus _PROTEIN_ reporter gene construct were generated . we performed an in silico analysis of all _PROTEIN_ introns using the _PROTEIN_ online program that predicts intron mediated enhancement of transcription . the first and the second introns of _PROTEIN_ showed high _PROTEIN_ scores . as _PROTEIN_ is closely flanked by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ a genomic fragment ranging from up to relative to the transcription initiation site of _PROTEIN_ was fused to the _METHOD_ gus reporter gene . only half of the lines of arabidopsis stably _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ gus construct showed gus staining . while gus staining intensity varied all positive lines showed a similar staining pattern . five representative lines were chosen for detailed analysis . in d old seedlings the shoot apical meristem was stained . in older plantlets _PROTEIN_ activity was also detected in leaf primordia and in basal parts of emerging leaves . surprisingly no gus activity and no _METHOD_ _METHOD_ could be detected in root _METHOD_ while immunostaining with anti _PROTEIN_ antibodies indicated the presence of _PROTEIN_ protein . possibly regulatory elements apart from the analyzed genomic fragment are required for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in root _METHOD_ . gus activity was found in inflorescence _METHOD_ young inflorescences and developing flower buds . older inflorescences displayed gus activity of variable intensity in developing sepals and pistils while in mature flowers gus staining was limited to styles . a negative relationship between gus staining intensity and tissue age was found in leaves flowers and siliques . for instance gus staining was detected in the basal part of young leaves containing actively dividing cells but not in developed leaves . gus activity indicates that _PROTEIN_ is active in dividing tissues similar to _PROTEIN_ except in roots _METHOD_ suggesting that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ might coincide with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ as expected based on its putative involvement in _PROTEIN_ deposition to centromeres . _PROTEIN_ of arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ is regulated by the transcription _PROTEIN_ family . to see whether _PROTEIN_ is similarly regulated the _PROTEIN_ promoter region was studied in silico using the _PROTEIN_ program . a potential binding site was found at bp upstream of _PROTEIN_ . moreover transgenic plants overexpressing showed a fold increase in _PROTEIN_ transcript level . thus _PROTEIN_ might be transcriptionally regulated in a similar way as _PROTEIN_ . to test whether deregulation of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ has an impact on the level of _PROTEIN_ at centromeres and subsequently on chromosome segregation three t dna insertion mutants were identified for the _PROTEIN_ gene . the positions of t dna insertions were confirmed by sequencing of pcr products from the corresponding genomic positions . the t dna insertion lines salk and salk contain insertions within the third and fourth intron respectively and salk within the fourth exon of _GENE_ . rt pcr analysis revealed for homozygous salk and salk mutants full length _PROTEIN_ transcripts at the level of the wild type and no obvious phenotypic abnormalities . homozygous salk yielded _PROTEIN_ transcripts from the region upstream the t dna insertion and a low amount of transcript from downstream the t dna . immunoblot and indirect immunostaining confirmed the absence of _PROTEIN_ in salk . only wild type seedlings revealed the expected immunoblot signal of kd . furthermore in contrast with the wild type the mutant did not show _PROTEIN_ immunosignals at chromocenters and most importantly the _PROTEIN_ level at chromocenters of the mutant was strongly reduced compared with the wild type . for both the mutant and arabidopsis wild type the immunostaining was repeated three times and each time root tips of the wild type and the mutants were analyzed . in all cases _PROTEIN_ immunosignals at chromocenters of _LOCATION_ were weaker than in the wild type . in a population of homozygous mutant plants the growth rate was highly variable and some plants showed an abnormal leaf shape . during flowering the mutant plants formed multiple shoots with siliques of reduced size . mitosis in root tip _METHOD_ of mutants did not reveal obvious abnormalities while somatic cell division in young flower buds of the mutant showed of anaphases with bridges and/or lagging chromosomes . analysis of meiocytes of the mutant showed micronuclei within pollen tetrads a reduced number of vital pollen grains and seed abortion . in siliques of the mutant on average of seeds were aborted while only aborted seeds were found in the wild type . colocalization of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ at arabidopsis centromeres _PROTEIN_ activity of both promoters in meristematic tissues and a reduction of _PROTEIN_ amount at centromeres of the mutant indicate an involvement of _PROTEIN_ in centromeric assembly of _PROTEIN_ . therefore we addressed the question how _PROTEIN_ activity and _PROTEIN_ assembly are regulated . since _PROTEIN_ contains an binding site and is active in dividing tissues it might be regulated by transcription _PROTEIN_ in a cell cycle dependent manner . the promoter binding capacity of transcription _PROTEIN_ is regulated by the retinoblastoma related _PROTEIN_ protein which when hypophosphorylated binds and inhibits their activity . downregulation of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ by rna interference results in a fold increase of _PROTEIN_ transcript . thus regulatory networks of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ b c and _PROTEIN_ genes were reconstructed based on gene by gene interactions . functional relationships between genes can be reconstructed based on for example modified transcriptional activity posttranscriptional modifications protein protein interactions of their products in different protein complexes or their participation in several metabolic pathways . since histone modifications and dna methylation of centromeric chromatin are important for assembly of _PROTEIN_ at centromeres genes encoding dna methyltransferase _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ dna _PROTEIN_ and the histone methyltransferase _PROTEIN_ were additionally included for analysis . the reconstituted regulatory network is composed of genes which are linked by a bar if the mutual information score was above . in a further step genes encoding proteins with unknown function as well as proteins of metabolic pathways were manually omitted from the network . to categorize the remaining genes the gene list was processed with the web based agrigo tool to perform an enrichment analysis for gene ontology _METHOD_ . this analysis showed that out of the genes belong to the cell cycle and the cell cycle regulation and to _LOCATION_ acid metabolism . a more comprehensive list of genes involved in these pathways is given in supplemental data set online . additionally the in silico analysis revealed a central role of the transcription _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in this regulatory network and its direct or indirect connection to the _PROTEIN_ of almost all genes of this network . since this analysis represents a general pattern of gene by gene regulation we inspected the tissue specific _PROTEIN_ pattern of selected arabidopsis genes using the software _PROTEIN_ and a set of microarrays predefined by the program _PROTEIN_ . the results are summarized in figure . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ showed a strong correlation to the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in roots leaves and flowers . _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ was correlated with that of and _PROTEIN_ in all analyzed tissues . thus microarray derived data suggest that _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ and of _PROTEIN_ is controlled by the _PROTEIN_ pathway and is tightly connected with the _PROTEIN_ of dna and histone methyltransferases . to test whether the regulatory pathway of _PROTEIN_ assembly reconstituted for arabidopsis is conserved among different _METHOD_ we generated a _PROTEIN_ assembly pathway for human using the _PROTEIN_ tool . since we found that human components of the _PROTEIN_ pathway dna methyltransferases and histone lysine methyltransferases have a strongly coordinated _PROTEIN_ and for some components of this regulatory network protein protein interactions were demonstrated experimentally this network _METHOD_ indeed to be highly conserved among eukaryotes . real time rt pcr analysis showed the absence of _PROTEIN_ transcripts in seedlings and flower buds of the mutant and a strong transcript reduction in flower buds of hemizygous _PROTEIN_ plants . notably in the mutant not only the amount of the _PROTEIN_ protein was reduced but also the _PROTEIN_ transcript level in seedlings and flower buds of the mutant was reduced compared with that of the wild type . the reduction was more pronounced in flower buds than in seedlings . even in flower buds of hemizygous _PROTEIN_ mutants the _PROTEIN_ transcript level was reduced to of the wild type . by contrast we found that downregulation of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ rnai transformants does not influence the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ indicating an upstream function of _PROTEIN_ relative to _PROTEIN_ . as suggested by the predicted regulatory network the histone methyltransferase _PROTEIN_ and members of the rna directed dna methylation pathway _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ are candidates that are potentially influenced by reduced _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . therefore we analyzed the _PROTEIN_ of the histone methyltransferase encoding genes _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in d old seedlings of arabidopsis wild type mutants and _PROTEIN_ rnai transformants by real time rt pcr . we found that _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ was reduced in the mutant to of the wild type level but _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ was only slightly lower than in the wild type . in _PROTEIN_ rnai transformants _PROTEIN_ of all three genes remained at the level of the wild type . additionally we analyzed _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in flower buds of wild type hemizygous and homozygous mutant plants . already in hemizygous lines all three histone methyltransferases analyzed showed a reduced transcript level . this effect was more pronounced in homozygous mutants . since _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was strongly correlated with that of _PROTEIN_ and of histone methyltransferase _PROTEIN_ we asked whether the level of dna methylation mediated by rna dependent dna methylation is also affected in mutants . because it is difficult to analyze dna methylation in centromeric regions which can not be distinguished from pericentromeric regions we performed bisulfite conversion of the genome and sequenced the intergenic region at the medea locus _PROTEIN_ and the at locus . both loci have been used in several studies as marker regions for the effect of mutations on rddm at endogenous sequences . in seedlings the dna methylation in asymmetric context at _PROTEIN_ isr and at at is significantly reduced compared with the wild type seedlings . such reduction of rddm in the at region was also described for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutant plants and for other components of the rddm pathway . thus we assume that _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis is involved in the rddm pathway and might contribute to reduce histone lysine di methylation via reduced cytosine methylation .
the entire open reading frames of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ n and _PROTEIN_ c fragments were amplified by rt pcr with rna isolated from flower buds of arabidopsis thaliana wild type and cloned into the vector via the gateway _PROTEIN_ reaction . from clones they were recombined via gateway lr reaction into the two attr recombination sites of the gateway compatible vectors and respectively to study localization of both proteins in vivo . to study the activity of the _PROTEIN_ promoter in different tissues of arabidopsis a _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ gus reporter construct was generated using a genomic
