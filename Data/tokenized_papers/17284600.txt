sugar compartmentation into _LOCATION_ of higher plants is a very important physiological process providing extra space for transient and long term sugar storage and contributing to the osmoregulation of cell turgor and shape . despite the long standing knowledge of this subcellular sugar partitioning the proteins responsible for these transport steps have remained unknown . we have identified a gene family in arabidopsis consisting of three members homologous to known sugar transporters . one member of this family arabidopsis thaliana _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ transporter _PROTEIN_ was localized to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . moreover we provide evidence for transport activity of a tonoplast sugar transporter based on its functional _PROTEIN_ in bakers yeast and uptake studies in isolated yeast _LOCATION_ . analyses of _PROTEIN_ mutant lines indicate an important function of this _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ transporter during developmental processes like seed germination and flowering .
our in silico analyses revealed a high degree of sequence homology to the known atstp gene family of monosaccharide transporters in arabidopsis for three previously unknown orfs _GENE_ _GENE_ and _GENE_ . we generated the corresponding cdnas comprising the entire orfs by rt pcr from flowers in the case of _GENE_ and whole plant mrna in the cases of _GENE_ and _GENE_ . sequence determination confirmed the predicted exon/intron structure for all three genes with introns at conserved positions and characterized them as a distinct gene family within the arabidopsis monosaccharide transporter like superfamily . _GENE_ and _GENE_ show the highest degree of protein sequence conservation whereas _GENE_ the most distant member of this family shares only and similar amino acids with _GENE_ and _GENE_ respectively . hydropathy analyses of the protein sequences predict transmembrane helices for the newly identified hexose transporter homologs . in the current study we focus on the characterization of one of the arabidopsis genes _GENE_ _PROTEIN_ . because of its homology to known monosaccharide transporters _PROTEIN_ was tested for the ability to complement a hexose transport deficient yeast mutant . whereas the _PROTEIN_ of some of the known arabidopsis hexose transporters could restore growth of this yeast mutant on _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ of _GENE_ did not complement the hexose transport deficient null mutant . therefore to verify _PROTEIN_ and to determine a possible subcellular localization a _METHOD_ tagged version of the _PROTEIN_ gene was _PROTEIN_ in this yeast strain . as shown in fig ref _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was not seen in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ but rather in internal structures strongly resembling _LOCATION_ . when we then isolated _LOCATION_ from the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ yeast strain the fusion protein was clearly confined to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ as shown by the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . the tonoplast localization of the _METHOD_ fusion protein observed in transgenic yeast lead us to investigate the subcellular localization of the _GENE_ gene product in arabidopsis . to this end we transiently _PROTEIN_ a _METHOD_ fusion in arabidopsis protoplasts . confocal microscopy allowed a clear assignment of the fusion protein to the tonoplast most obvious in the regions where chloroplasts are seen . moreover after protoplast lysis by mild osmotic shock _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was seen only in the _LOCATION_ of the remaining intact _LOCATION_ reconfirming the _LOCATION_ localization of _PROTEIN_ in planta . to investigate the transport properties of _PROTEIN_ we again used bakers yeast as a heterologous _PROTEIN_ system and isolated _LOCATION_ for transport assays . to first test the functionality of the isolated _LOCATION_ we verified uptake competence for amino acids as described by ohsumi and anraku . _PROTEIN_ dependent lysine uptake demonstrated proper function of the _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ . these _LOCATION_ were then further tested for _PROTEIN_ uptake activity . whereas no _PROTEIN_ uptake was detected in the control strain _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in antisense _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ strain _PROTEIN_ showed a time dependent accumulation of labeled _PROTEIN_ . furthermore omitting _PROTEIN_ in the reaction mix completely abolished _PROTEIN_ uptake strongly suggesting the presence of an energy dependent transport mechanism that would allow accumulation of the substrate against a concentration gradient . we further tested other hexoses and sugar alcohols which are known to accumulate in _LOCATION_ under certain conditions and the pentose xylose . as seen in fig ref b none of the other sugars was taken up by _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ except fructose which is also transported but only to of the _PROTEIN_ transport rate . fructose is a sugar also found in plant _LOCATION_ in appreciable concentrations . finally concentration dependent rates for _PROTEIN_ mediated _PROTEIN_ uptake were determined and a k m of mm was calculated from the lineweaver burk plot . because of the demonstrated _LOCATION_ localization and the described transport properties we named the transporter _PROTEIN_ . to investigate the _PROTEIN_ profile of the _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ transporter gene that we identified we generated transgenic reporter plants _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ gene under the control of the _PROTEIN_ promoter . analysis of the reporter plants revealed _PROTEIN_ promoter activity only in anthers where it was restricted to pollen grains . rt pcr experiments reconfirmed the gene 's high rate of _PROTEIN_ in flowers . however using this method we also were able to detect the _PROTEIN_ transcript in leaves and _METHOD_ with lower but significant abundance except in roots . to obtain an estimate of the relative _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ levels in other tissues the genevestigator ar . thaliana microarray database and analysis toolbox was queried . according to this database _PROTEIN_ mrna accumulates to significant levels in all developmental stages and all organs except in roots . higher _PROTEIN_ transcript levels are found in the shoot apex and in seeds . we conclude that _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ at low levels in all above ground tissues and particularly strongly in pollen . to assess the physiological importance of _PROTEIN_ transport function we analyzed t dna insertion mutants obtained from the european arabidopsis stock center . for two lines and homozygousity of the t dna insertion and absence of _PROTEIN_ transcript were verified by pcr analyses . in the line the t dna insertion was detected by a specific pcr product but in contrast to the wild type control no pcr product was obtained through the use of primers spanning the insertion site because of the size of the t dna . the lack of _PROTEIN_ transcript in the line was demonstrated by rt pcr . because _PROTEIN_ is strongly _PROTEIN_ in flowers and shows above average _PROTEIN_ levels in the shoot apex we particularly examined a possible influence of the _PROTEIN_ knockout on flowering . as shown in fig ref eliminating _PROTEIN_ transport function leads to a drastic delay in flowering . under long day conditions wild type plants started to grow primary shoots days after germination . in contrast under identical conditions _PROTEIN_ mutant lines did not start bolting until days after germination . however this drastic delay in bolting did not lead to a complete absence of flowering because all _PROTEIN_ mutant plants eventually produced shoots with flowers and seeds comparable with those produced by wild type . in addition to this delayed flowering phenotype we found that of the _PROTEIN_ mutant seeds did not germinate indicating a function for _PROTEIN_ also during processes like seed development and/or germination . the observed mutant phenotypes support a model in which _LOCATION_ sugar accumulation is required for osmotic adjustment and turgor increase during developmental processes like seed germination and flowering .
escherichia coli strain was used for cloning . heterologous _PROTEIN_ was performed in s. cerevisiae strain . yeast transformation was as described . ar . thaliana col was grown in a greenhouse in potting soil or on agar medium in growth chambers under a h h dark regime at and relative humidity . transformations of ar . thaliana were performed with agrobacterium tumefaciens strains . a bp pcr fragment containing the complete _PROTEIN_ coding sequence was amplified from flower specific cdna by using primers _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ cloned into pgem t easy and sequenced . the _PROTEIN_ cdna fragment from was ligated into the unique ecori site of the s. cerevisiae/e . coli shuttle vector _PROTEIN_ e in both sense and antisense orientation yielding constructs and respectively . both constructs were then used to transform the hexose transporter deficient s. cerevisiae strain yielding strains _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . transport tests were performed with isolated _LOCATION_ from transgenic yeasts . to isolate yeast _LOCATION_ a modified protocol of ohsumi and anraku was used . in brief yeast cells were grown to of . cells were harvested at g for min washed twice with distilled water and resuspended in ml of spheroplasting buffer . after incubation at for h spheroplasts were harvested by centrifugation washed twice with m sorbitol and resuspended in buffer a . spheroplast lysis was further improved by using a dounce homogenizer . cell debris was removed by centrifuging the homogenate . the supernatant was overlayered with fresh buffer a and centrifuged for h at g . floating _LOCATION_ were harvested from the surface and resuspended in buffer c . for transport assays with isolated yeast _LOCATION_ the standard reaction consisted of of _LOCATION_ protein mm mes tris mm mm _PROTEIN_ mm cold substrate and of labeled substrate . this reaction mixture was incubated at for min without substrate . the transport assay process was started by adding the substrate and stopped by diluting the mixture with ml of ice cold buffer c. _LOCATION_ were quickly recovered on a nitrocellulose filter and washed with ml of cold buffer c. the radioactivity was measured in a scintillation counter by adding the nitrocellulose filter to ml of scintillation mixture . a bp promoter fragment from arabidopsis genomic dna was amplified by pcr with primers _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and then digested with sphi and ncoi restriction enzymes . the resulting bp sphi/ncoi fragment was ligated into the vector which is a based plasmid that harbors the gus reporter gene and sequenced yielding construct . a kb xmai/ecori fragment comprising the _PROTEIN_ promoter followed by the gus gene and the nos terminator was cloned into the plant vector pgptv bar yielding . arabidopsis plants were transformed by floral dip using ag . tumefaciens strain which harbors the construct . transformation of arabidopsis resulted in independent basta resistant transformants and reporter gene activity was studied in all of these plants in the generation . rt pcrs were performed by using total rna from different tissues and _PROTEIN_ specific primers _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or specific primers _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and yielding and bp products respectively . for transient _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusions the _PROTEIN_ coding sequence was pcr amplified with the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and inserted into the unique ncoi cloning site of _METHOD_ . with the resulting plasmid arabidopsis protoplasts were transformed by polyethylene glycol transformation modified according to the methods of abel and theologis and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was monitored by confocal microscopy . for arabidopsis t dna insertion lines the insertion site was reconfirmed and lines with a homozygous t dna insertion were identified . for insertion lines the t dna insertion was verified by genomic pcr with the t dna specific primer _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . the insertion was localized in the utr at position _PROTEIN_ by sequencing the bp pcr product . lines with homozygous t dna insertion were identified by genomic pcr with the _PROTEIN_ specific primers _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . the same procedure was used for line in which the insertion was localized at position by using primers _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . homozygous t dna insertion lines were identified by rt pcr with total rna from flowers and _PROTEIN_ specific primers _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ .
