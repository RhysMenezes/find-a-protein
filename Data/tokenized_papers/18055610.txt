a subfamily of rab _PROTEIN_ regulates a variety of endosomal functions as a molecular switch . arabidopsis thaliana has two different types of member _PROTEIN_ conventional type _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and a plant specific type _PROTEIN_ . we found that only one guanine nucleotide exchange _PROTEIN_ named _PROTEIN_ can activate all members to _PROTEIN_ bound _METHOD_ in vitro in spite of their diverged structures . in the _PROTEIN_ mutant whose gef activity is completely lost embryogenesis was arrested at the torpedo stage . green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were diffused in _LOCATION_ like gdp fixed mutants of in _PROTEIN_ indicating that both types of _PROTEIN_ are regulated by _PROTEIN_ . in the leaky _PROTEIN_ mutant elongation of the primary root was severely affected . overexpression of the _PROTEIN_ fixed form of _PROTEIN_ suppressed the _PROTEIN_ mutation but overexpression of _PROTEIN_ had no apparent effects . these results indicate that the two types of plant members are functionally differentiated even though they are regulated by the same activator _PROTEIN_ .
arabidopsis has two genes that encode proteins containing the _PROTEIN_ domain _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in its genome . _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ in all tissues we examined by immunoblotting using an anti _PROTEIN_ antibody . this is also supported by published microarray data _PROTEIN_ . we also found that mutations in _PROTEIN_ severely affect various stages of plant development as will be described _PROTEIN_ . on the other hand we have been unable to detect any _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ by rt pcr . there are no _PROTEIN_ data such as est clones deposited in the database as far as we could determine . furthermore our analysis of t dna insertion mutants of _PROTEIN_ revealed no obvious phenotype . these results strongly suggest that _PROTEIN_ functions predominantly throughout arabidopsis development and that _PROTEIN_ has very limited roles if any . _PROTEIN_ encodes a protein of amino acid residues _PROTEIN_ . similarity analysis revealed that _PROTEIN_ and other gefs share similarity only within the _PROTEIN_ domain at the n terminal half of the protein . we did not find any known motif or similarity to other proteins for the c terminal half of _PROTEIN_ . as there are two different types of in arabidopsis it is an interesting question to ask whether _PROTEIN_ with the conserved _PROTEIN_ domain could activate all of these members . to answer this question we measured the gef activity of _PROTEIN_ toward the three members of arabidopsis by monitoring the change in intrinsic trp _METHOD_ upon nucleotide exchange . as we predicted _PROTEIN_ stimulated the nucleotide exchange of conventional type _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in a dose dependent manner . interestingly _PROTEIN_ also activated the plant specific _PROTEIN_ as efficiently as _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . these gef activities are highly specific to members _PROTEIN_ showed no activity at all to other subclasses of arabidopsis rab _PROTEIN_ . these specific interactions between _PROTEIN_ and members were confirmed by the yeast two hybrid assay and the in vitro pull down assay . in these experiments we examined the nucleotide dependence of the interactions . when wild type and mutant versions of _PROTEIN_ were used as baits in the yeast two hybrid assay _PROTEIN_ showed positive interaction only with the gdp fixed and the nucleotide free _METHOD_ but not with the wild type and _PROTEIN_ fixed _METHOD_ . _PROTEIN_ gave similar results . _PROTEIN_ interacted with gdp fixed and nucleotide free _METHOD_ but not with wild type and _PROTEIN_ fixed _METHOD_ of _PROTEIN_ . the interactions of _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were also detected in the pull down assay . it should be noted here that wild type _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ could form complexes with _PROTEIN_ in the pull down assay which may appear to contradict the results of the yeast two hybrid assay . we assume that this is due to the difference of the nucleotide environment between these experimental _METHOD_ most purified fused with glutathione s transferase _PROTEIN_ are presumably in the gdp bound state because they hydrolyze bound _PROTEIN_ to gdp during the purification procedure while a considerable amount of wild type should be in the _PROTEIN_ bound form because of the high _PROTEIN_ gdp ratio in yeast cells . we could not detect a stable interaction between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in the pull down assay . this result may reflect the more transient association of these molecules . no physical interaction was observed for other subclasses of rab _PROTEIN_ either in the yeast two hybrid or the pull down assay . from these data we concluded that _PROTEIN_ acts as a specific gef for all three members of the arabidopsis group in vitro . arabidopsis mutant lines in which one of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ is knocked out develop normally and do not show any significant phenotypes . in order to understand the importance of activation in plant development we characterized two mutant alleles of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ mutant contains a t dna insertion in the third exon which leads to the loss of the _PROTEIN_ domain . thus this mutant allele should have lost its gef activity completely . pcr based genotyping of the progeny derived from self pollinated heterozygous mutant plants revealed that the homozygous _PROTEIN_ plant is inviable whereas the heterozygous mutants were morphologically indistinguishable from wild type plants . in the seed pods of the heterozygous mutant of seeds were aborted with small brownish and shriveled appearance . these abnormal seeds contained small rudimentary embryos whose development was arrested at the torpedo stage . a genomic fragment containing the entire _PROTEIN_ gene rescued this embryonic lethal phenotype . our results demonstrate that the regulator _PROTEIN_ plays an essential role during arabidopsis embryo development . to examine mutant embryogenesis in more detail we observed the development of embryos in cleared seed pods from the heterozygous _PROTEIN_ mutants . the development of the homozygous _PROTEIN_ mutant was delayed from the early globular stage indicating that the function of _PROTEIN_ is required from very early stages of embryogenesis . to understand the role of _PROTEIN_ in postembryonic development we next characterized a weaker mutant allele of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . in this allele t dna is inserted in the fifth exon which is located behind the _PROTEIN_ domain coding region . based on the analysis of transcripts in _PROTEIN_ by rapid amplification of cdna ends this mutant allele was expected to _PROTEIN_ an incomplete polypeptide with a molecular _METHOD_ of kd which consists of the n terminal amino acid residues of _PROTEIN_ and an additional residues translated from the vector sequence . by immunoblotting however only a faint band of kd was detected in the _PROTEIN_ plant lysate . quantitative comparison of the amounts of accumulating products was not possible from this result because we realized that the anti _PROTEIN_ polyclonal antibody used in this experiment preferentially recognized the c terminal region of _PROTEIN_ but it is likely that the _PROTEIN_ protein is unstable and partially degraded in the mutant plants . the _PROTEIN_ mutant apparently completed embryogenesis normally but some postembryonic defects were observed in root development . the elongation of the primary root was severely repressed in _PROTEIN_ and the branching pattern was also affected causing abnormal architecture of the root system . the growth retardation of the primary root was observed at d after germination and the average root length of d old mutant seedlings was mm which was approximately three times shorter than the length of wild type roots . the mutant phenotypes of _PROTEIN_ were complemented by the genomic fragment containing the _PROTEIN_ gene . these results further demonstrate that _PROTEIN_ function is required during postembryonic root growth . next we prepared plastic sections of the two mutants of _PROTEIN_ and observed them by light microscopy to examine the effects of mutations on tissue and cell structures . as shown in figures to the cell file alignment was disordered in both the cotyledon and the hypocotyl in _PROTEIN_ embryos at the torpedo stage probably because the patterns of cell division were severely affected . cells were significantly hypertrophied in such embryos and incomplete cell plates and abnormal cell wall depositions were frequently observed . because similar phenotypes were also observed even in the d old root of the leaky mutant _PROTEIN_ at which stage the root elongation defect was not yet apparent the defects in cell plate formation and cell wall depositions could be direct consequences of the failure to activate . these phenotypes were also confirmed by scanning electron microscopy . the _PROTEIN_ embryos showed a bumpier surface because of hypertrophied cells in disordered alignment . the texture of the cell wall was affected as well the furrows observed on the cell wall were shallower on the mutant which may be due to the impaired cell wall biogenesis or _PROTEIN_ in the mutant . to elucidate the effects of the _PROTEIN_ mutation at the ultrastructural level we next observed the _PROTEIN_ embryos at different developmental stages by transmission electron microscopy . the most conspicuous feature observed in the mutant embryos at the early globular stage when only a little morphological alteration was detectable by light microscopy was the accumulation of multivesiculated _LOCATION_ structures associated with the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . these structures contained vesicular _LOCATION_ structures between the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and the cell wall . similar membranous structures were also occasionally seen in wild type embryos but the frequency was much lower than in the _PROTEIN_ mutant _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ . similar structures with a much larger size were also observed in mutant cells which often appeared to be engulfed into _LOCATION_ . structures with such characteristic morphology have been described in the literature as pmbs or _LOCATION_ whose biogenesis and function have been disputed for a long time . our observation in _PROTEIN_ embryos strongly suggests that the biogenesis of the pmbs should be regulated by activity . other organelles such as the _LOCATION_ apparatus _LOCATION_ and the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ showed no significant difference in their structure from those in wild type cells . we also observed the mutant embryos at the torpedo stage whose development was arrested almost completely . we rarely found pmb like structures in either mutant or wild type cells at this stage . instead other abnormal _LOCATION_ structures such as dense vesicles around the _LOCATION_ apparatus small cup or _PROTEIN_ shaped structures and autophagosome like structures were accumulating . the protein storage _LOCATION_ in the mutant cells showed lower electron density than those in the wild type cells . the accumulating _LOCATION_ derived vesicles had a similar electron density to that of protein storage _LOCATION_ observed in wild type embryos thus these vesicles might be intermediates of the storage protein transport from the _LOCATION_ to _LOCATION_ . the auxin efflux carrier _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ localized in various tissues and continuously cycles between endosomes and the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . this cycling is dependent on _PROTEIN_ a gef of arf _PROTEIN_ whose function is also essential for the correct localization of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . to examine whether the activation of catalyzed by _PROTEIN_ plays some role in _PROTEIN_ trafficking we examined the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ localization in the _PROTEIN_ embryos . in cotyledon epidermal cells of wild type embryos at the heart stage _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ localized on the apical region of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . on the other hand _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ lost the _PROTEIN_ and resided on the entire region of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ in the cells of the mutant embryos . in these cells some punctate structures were also observed on or beneath the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . these observations indicate that the activity of _PROTEIN_ is also essential for the establishment or _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ localization of _PROTEIN_ . the conventional type rab _PROTEIN_ cycles between _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ depending on their nucleotide state . the gdp bound rab is held in _LOCATION_ by the rab _PROTEIN_ and when activated to the _PROTEIN_ bound state by the gef rab becomes associated with the _LOCATION_ . as for the plant unique _PROTEIN_ which recycles between _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ independently of rab _PROTEIN_ the gdp fixed mutant protein also disperses into _LOCATION_ when _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis plants . thus if _PROTEIN_ is the major activator of all members in arabidopsis the defect in its gef activity will cause the delocalization of all members from the endosomal _LOCATION_ to the _LOCATION_ . to test this possibility we examined the subcellular localization of _METHOD_ tagged members in _PROTEIN_ embryos . to avoid possible mislocalization due to overexpression we constructed translational fusions of their genomic sequences and _METHOD_ . as reported previously _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ localized _PROTEIN_ on punctate organelles in wild type embryos . on the other hand both _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ showed diffuse localization in mutant embryos . these results indicate that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were not activated properly in the _PROTEIN_ mutant which strongly suggests that _PROTEIN_ is the direct and apparently the sole activator of both types of members in vivo . _PROTEIN_ mutant plants show defects in primary root elongation and branching pattern . if these are caused by faulty activation the _PROTEIN_ of the constitutively active _PROTEIN_ form of is expected to alleviate the phenotypes . to verify this hypothesis we overexpressed _PROTEIN_ fixed mutants of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ under the regulation of the cauliflower mosaic virus promoter . as shown in figure _PROTEIN_ clearly suppressed the defect in the primary root elongation of _PROTEIN_ . by contrast _PROTEIN_ had no obvious effect on any _PROTEIN_ phenotypes although _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ at a comparable level to _PROTEIN_ in suppressed lines . as the morphological alteration of endosomes caused by _PROTEIN_ was also observed in arabidopsis plants _PROTEIN_ it _PROTEIN_ should be active when _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis plants . thus our results strongly suggest that the defects in the primary root of _PROTEIN_ are attributed to the faulty activation of the conventional type . in other words and more importantly the physiological functions of the plant unique _PROTEIN_ and the conventional type _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are clearly differentiated even though they are all activated by the same gef _PROTEIN_ .
