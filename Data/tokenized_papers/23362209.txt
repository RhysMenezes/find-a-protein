imbibed seeds of the arabidopsis thaliana accession djarly are affected in mucilage release from seed coat epidermal cells . the impaired locus was identified as a pectin methylesterase inhibitor gene pectin methylesterase _PROTEIN_ specifically _PROTEIN_ in seed coat epidermal cells at the time when mucilage polysaccharides are accumulated . this spatio temporal regulation appears to be modulated by and _PROTEIN_ homolog/mucilage as _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ is reduced in mutants of these transcription regulators . in _PROTEIN_ mucilage release was delayed and outer cell walls of epidermal cells did not fragment . pectin methylesterases demethylate homogalacturonan and the majority of hg found in wild type mucilage was in _PROTEIN_ derived from outer cell wall fragments . this correlated with the absence of methylesterified hg labeling in _PROTEIN_ whereas transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ coding sequence under the control of the promoter had increased labeling of cell wall fragments . activity tests on seeds from _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ transgenic plants showed that _PROTEIN_ inhibits endogenous pme activities in agreement with reduced overall methylesterification of mucilage fractions and demucilaged seeds . another regulator of pme activity in seed coat epidermal cells the subtilisin like ser protease acts on different pmes as a _PROTEIN_ mutant showed an additive phenotype .
seeds of new accessions obtained from central asia were imbibed in the pectin dye ruthenium red and the djarly accession from kyrgyzstan was found not to release mucilage . the gene affecting mucilage release in djarly was identified using map based cloning the affected locus was localized between and mb on chromosome . homozygous mutants were obtained for insertion lines in of the annotated genes and their seeds analyzed for mucilage release . only one mutant had seeds with a phenotype equivalent to djarly and this had an insertion in the gene _GENE_ predicted to encode a pmei that we named _PROTEIN_ . two additional insertion mutant alleles _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were obtained and neither released mucilage when they were imbibed with ruthenium red . to test for allelism _PROTEIN_ was crossed to djarly _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and in all cases and seed coats did not release mucilage the djarly mutant allele was termed _PROTEIN_ . furthermore seeds from the backcrossed _PROTEIN_ mutant still exhibited the phenotype . the release of mucilage from seed coats of seeds used for mapping or from the backcross indicated that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutant alleles were recessive and maternally inherited . to identify the nature of the mutant allele in the djarly accession the _GENE_ gene was sequenced and three nucleotide _METHOD_ were identified compared with columbia . the first substituted ser for arg the second at leu was a synonymous mutation and the third caused a frameshift mutation due to a bp insertion bp after the _PROTEIN_ codon that changed amino acids to followed by the introduction of a stop codon . pmeis inhibit pmes through the formation of a reversible complex . structural studies have shown that pmeis have two distinct functional domains an helical hairpin structure that stabilizes the pme pmei complex and a c terminal bundle domain that interacts directly with the pme active site thereby blocking substrate access . modeling of the effects of the djarly mutations on pmei _PROTEIN_ structure indicated that the bundle domain would be modified in particular the helix predicted to interact with the pme binding cleft which would explain the lack of _PROTEIN_ function . molecular complementation of the _PROTEIN_ mutant phenotype was also performed the mutant was transformed with a construct containing the _PROTEIN_ coding sequence downstream of the cauliflower mosaic virus promoter and independent transformants were obtained . when seeds were sown on agarose plates mucilage release was restored in at least of seeds from all transformants compared with < in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ was analyzed in the _PROTEIN_ mutant by rt pcr on rna extracts from developing seeds using _PROTEIN_ specific primers situated either side of the _PROTEIN_ insertion at the and extremities of _PROTEIN_ . amplification of the control gene was similar in the wild type and _PROTEIN_ . by contrast no amplification was obtained using primers on either side of the _PROTEIN_ t dna insertion site and encompassing the entire cds indicating that no full length transcript was recreated by splicing out the t dna insertion and that the _PROTEIN_ mutant is a knockout . reduced fragment amplification was observed in the mutant for the _PROTEIN_ region compared with the wild type and only a faint fragment was observed for the _PROTEIN_ region that could result from a low level of transcript reinitiation from within the t dna insertion . unlike the wild type _PROTEIN_ mutant seeds did not release mucilage within the first few minutes of imbibition in ruthenium red . nevertheless it was noted that mucilage was released from _PROTEIN_ seeds when imbibition time was increased indicating that mucilage release was delayed . in addition to this delay the outer primary cell wall did not break up and leave fragments attached to the top of columella instead it was observed attached to the hilum as a large sheet of cell wall . to quantify this delay in mucilage release soluble extracts were measured for gala contents after imbibition of seeds for different lengths of time in water . the mucilage release rate for mutant seeds was less than half that of the wild type vmax compared with vmax _PROTEIN_ and vmax _PROTEIN_ . furthermore the total amount of gala released from _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ seeds never reached wild type levels even after h of imbibition . ruthenium red staining intensity and the _PROTEIN_ of the adherent mucilage appeared the same in the wild type and _PROTEIN_ after imbibition in either water or the cation chelator edta . in accordance with the delayed mucilage release observed for _PROTEIN_ seeds available in silico _PROTEIN_ data indicated highest _PROTEIN_ levels in whole siliques or seeds and in particular the seed coat _PROTEIN_ observed in other tissues such as _METHOD_ and flowers buds was weak in comparison . to confirm these data and to determine in which silique tissues _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ quantitative rt pcr was performed on dissected seeds silique envelopes and whole siliques at developmental stages when mucilage polysaccharides are produced and deposited . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was highest in developing seeds at dap corresponding to seeds with torpedo stage embryos . a diminution of transcript accumulation was observed at _PROTEIN_ stages in agreement with in silico transcriptome data . to obtain more detailed information about the spatial _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ within the seed _PROTEIN_ reporter gene _PROTEIN_ was observed in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . this mutant was generated using an enhancer trap ds element that contains the gus reporter gene . in _PROTEIN_ the gus gene is correctly orientated for control by the endogenous _PROTEIN_ promoter . in addition wild type transformants containing a translational fusion with _METHOD_ were examined and in situ hybridization performed using a _PROTEIN_ specific probe . the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ produced was not functional since the phenotypes of the _PROTEIN_ mutant were not restored when transformed with the same construct . for reporter gene analyses cell walls were counterstained with propidium iodide to facilitate visualization . analyses were performed on the same four seed developmental stages as for qrt pcr . _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ transcripts and protein was observed to be specific to the epidermal cells of the seed coat . at dap _PROTEIN_ delimited the cytoplasm found at the base of the epidermal cells and in a column containing accumulated starch granules . as seed coat differentiation progresses secondary cell wall material accumulated to form the columella and reinforce radial cell walls . the column of cytoplasm was thus reduced at dap and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was observed in this restricted cytoplasm . the structure of mutant seed coat epidermal cells was examined in more detail by scanning electron microscopy on mature dry seeds . the epidermal cells of both wild type and _PROTEIN_ mutant seeds were equivalent in size and morphology with a characteristic polygonal form and a central columella . no difference in the outer and radial cell walls was observed that could explain the delay in mucilage release and the nonfragmentation of the outer cell wall in _PROTEIN_ . developing seed coat epidermal cells from the _PROTEIN_ mutant were also compared with the wild type in seed sections staged from to dap . cell structure and the timing of differentiation looked the same in particular outer and radial cell walls and mucilage accumulation appeared unchanged . the adherent mucilage layer of wild type col has previously been shown to be composed of two domains that both contain hg as a minor component . the dm of this hg is variable being moderate in the inner domain and high in the outer domain . to determine whether _PROTEIN_ influences this dm whole mount immunolabeling was performed on mature dry seeds of wild type _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ overexpressor lines _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . seeds were costained for glycans present in the epidermal cell columella and cell walls as well as cellulose in the mucilage using the _METHOD_ probe calcofluor . in the _PROTEIN_ mutant neither moderately nor highly methyl esterified hgs were detectable with and antibodies respectively . by contrast labeling with both jim antibodies was increased in _PROTEIN_ compared with the wild type . similar increases in labeling were also observed for _PROTEIN_ seeds complemented with the same construct . furthermore calcofluor labeling in the _PROTEIN_ mutant showed naked columella with no fragments from outer cell wall breakage attached to their tops . to determine if _PROTEIN_ acts as an inhibitor of pme activity found in seeds assays were performed using total protein extracts from mature dry seeds of the wild type _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ pme activities were normalized to the average wild type activity . activity levels were higher in _PROTEIN_ mutant seeds with a increase in global pme activity . in addition pme activity was _PROTEIN_ in seeds of overexpressor lines by compared with the wild type . similarly activity levels were reduced in three _PROTEIN_ transformants complemented with the same _PROTEIN_ construct . pme activity was also determined for proteins released with soluble mucilage from imbibed seeds which correspond to proteins present in the apoplasmic mucilage pocket of seed coat epidermal cells . the diameters of activity halos and their staining intensity showed the same tendencies as for whole seeds with higher and lower pme activities in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ respectively compared with the wild type . water soluble mucilage adherent mucilage and demucilaged seeds were obtained from the wild type _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants using a sequential extraction procedure and analyzed for their sugar and methanol contents . as the major component of arabidopsis mucilage is rg i the majority of sugars present in the soluble and adherent mucilage from the wild type were rha and gala in a molar ratio close to in agreement with previous studies . in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ soluble mucilage a reduction in total sugars of up to was observed which was _PROTEIN_ due to a reduction in rha and gala . by contrast adherent mucilage total sugars increased by over in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ again due to modified rha and gala contents . the _PROTEIN_ mutants thus showed a redistribution of water soluble to adherent mucilage in the wild type water soluble mucilage represented of total mucilage whereas in _PROTEIN_ mutants this was reduced to < . furthermore an overall reduction in mucilage total sugars was measured in mutant extracts as previously observed in mucilage release assays and this was _PROTEIN_ due to a reduction in gala . by contrast gala contents increased slightly in demucilaged seed extracts . to determine whether the overall degree of methylesterification was modified in _PROTEIN_ mutants a methanol release assay was conducted by alkali treatment of extracts . methanol release was reduced by more than and in _PROTEIN_ water soluble mucilage adherent mucilage and demucilaged seeds respectively corresponding to a total _PROTEIN_ of more than compared with the wild type . previous _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ analysis of soluble mucilage digested by rhamnogalacturonan hydrolase identified a series of rg i oligomers that did not appear to be methylated . the methanol measured in wild type soluble and adherent mucilage is therefore most likely derived from methylesterified hg domains . in effect immunolabeling experiments have detected small amounts of methylesterified hg in wild type adherent mucilage . to determine whether the reduction in gala contents measured corresponded to gala derived from rg i or hg analyses were performed on fractions obtained after precipitation of hg pectin domains with ethanol . gala derived from hg showed a dramatic _PROTEIN_ in the mutants compared with the wild type for both water soluble and adherent mucilage extracts of > and respectively . by comparing to the values obtained for total gala contents values for rg i related gala were calculated and showed that in _PROTEIN_ mutants most of the gala redistributed from soluble to adherent mucilage was rgi derived gala while nearly all the hg derived gala was in demucilaged seeds . the occurrence of methylesterified hg domains in soluble mucilage was assessed by _METHOD_ analysis of pectin lyase digests . pectin lyase degrades highly methylesterified hg via a elimination mechanism producing unsaturated methylesterified gala oligomers that can be detected and identified by _METHOD_ . the _METHOD_ spectrum of the pectin lyase digest of wild type soluble mucilage was characterized by the presence of peaks attributed to unsaturated methylesterified gala oligomers with a degree of polymerization of to . the ions corresponding to and oligomers were visible in a zoom of the wild type _METHOD_ spectrum region corresponding to a _METHOD_ to charge ratio to . unsaturated gala oligomers of with to methyl groups and unsaturated gala oligomers of with or methyl groups were observed . in addition single sodiation of the _PROTEIN_ functions of predominant ions was detected at m/z and and potassium adducts and single sodiation of potassium adducts were observed . by contrast none of these peaks could be detected in the _METHOD_ spectrum of the pectin lyase digest of _PROTEIN_ soluble mucilage . taken together the results obtained from _METHOD_ and biochemical analyses reveal the presence of highly methylesterified hg domains in wild type mucilage that are absent from _PROTEIN_ mucilage . previous studies implicated _PROTEIN_ as a positive regulator of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in the induction of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . to assess whether _PROTEIN_ is regulated by these transcription _PROTEIN_ transcript abundance was analyzed by qrt pcr in developing seeds of the wild type and . steady state _PROTEIN_ transcript levels were markedly reduced in both and relative to the wild type . these results indicate that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are required for normal _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in the seed coat . to confirm this analysis pme activity assays were performed on protein extracts from mature dry seeds of and . figure shows that the pme activities of and were both altered compared with the wild type confirming that these transcription _PROTEIN_ influence pme activity . nevertheless while activity levels in were higher than those of the wild type as observed for the _PROTEIN_ mutant in activity levels _PROTEIN_ . a previously identified mutant does not release mucilage and has similar phenotypes to those observed for _PROTEIN_ mutants higher pme activity in seeds reduced methylesterification of mucilage nonfragmentation of the outer cell wall and its shedding in large pieces attached to the _PROTEIN_ end of the seed . it was hypothesized that the subtilisin like ser protease could activate pmei by removing the predicted inhibitory n terminal signal sequence or inactivate pme by proteolysis . to determine whether and _PROTEIN_ could act through regulating the same pme activity double mutants were obtained from a cross between _PROTEIN_ and . on direct imbibition of seeds in ruthenium red the seeds of _PROTEIN_ did not release mucilage as observed for seeds of the parental genotypes . furthermore when seeds were imbibed for h in either water or edta mucilage was released from all genotypes and staining of adherent mucilage was similar in width and intensity . in the same way as for the parent genotypes the outer cell wall did not fragment in the double mutant and remained attached to the hilum . by contrast while pme activities measured on dry seeds of the parental genotypes exhibited similar increases in pme activity compared with the wild type activities in _PROTEIN_ extracts were higher and corresponded to the addition of the increases observed for the parents indicating that they act on different pme activities .
