reductive catabolism of pyrimidine nucleotides occurs via a three step pathway in which uracil is degraded to alanine _PROTEIN_ and through sequential activities of dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase _PROTEIN_ dihydropyrimidinase _PROTEIN_ and ureidopropionase _PROTEIN_ .a proposed function of this pathway in addition to the _PROTEIN_ of pyrimidine homeostasis is the recycling of pyrimidine nitrogen to general nitrogen metabolism . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and catabolism of uracil are markedly elevated in response to nitrogen limitation in plants which can utilize uracil as a nitrogen _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ knockout mutants were used for functional analysis of this pathway in arabidopsis . pyd mutants exhibited no obvious phenotype under optimal growing conditions . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants were unable to catabolize uracil or to grow on uracil as the sole nitrogen source . by contrast catabolism of uracil was reduced by only in _PROTEIN_ mutants and _PROTEIN_ seedlings grew nearly as well as wild type seedlings with a uracil nitrogen source . these results confirm _PROTEIN_ function and suggest the possible existence of another as yet unknown activity for uracil degradation to dihydrouracil in this plant.the localization of _PROTEIN_ green _METHOD_ protein fusions in the _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ secretory system _PROTEIN_ and _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ suggests potentially complex metabolic regulation . reductive catabolism of pyrimidine nucleotides occurs via a three step pathway in which uracil is degraded to alanine _PROTEIN_ and through sequential activities of dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase _PROTEIN_ dihydropyrimidinase _PROTEIN_ and ureidopropionase _PROTEIN_ . a proposed function of this pathway in addition to the _PROTEIN_ of pyrimidine homeostasis is the recycling of pyrimidine nitrogen to general nitrogen metabolism . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and catabolism of uracil are markedly elevated in response to nitrogen limitation in plants which can utilize uracil as a nitrogen source . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ knockout mutants were used for functional analysis of this pathway in arabidopsis . pyd mutants exhibited no obvious phenotype under optimal growing conditions . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants were unable to catabolize uracil or to grow on uracil as the sole nitrogen source . by contrast catabolism of uracil was reduced by only in _PROTEIN_ mutants and _PROTEIN_ seedlings grew nearly as well as wild type seedlings with a uracil nitrogen source . these results confirm _PROTEIN_ function and suggest the possible existence of another as yet unknown activity for uracil degradation to dihydrouracil in this plant . the localization of _PROTEIN_ green _METHOD_ protein fusions in the _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ secretory system _PROTEIN_ and _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ suggests potentially complex metabolic regulation .
during the first few days after germination metabolic demands for seedling growth appear to be met primarily by the salvaging of nucleobases from seed reserves followed by increased de novo synthesis . as shown in _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ encoding the salvage enzyme uracil phosphoribosyl transferase is relatively high and remains unchanged between days and increasing slightly by day . nucleobase transporters _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are localized in vascular tissues and function as the major ura transporters in this plant . high _PROTEIN_ of the ura transporter _PROTEIN_ during the first day after germination may facilitate initial nucleobase salvaging from seedlings although its _PROTEIN_ subsequently _PROTEIN_ c. twofold until day when transcript levels increase c. fourfold . by contrast the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ is barely detectable at germination but increases dramatically over the following week with day transcript levels being fold higher than on day . the induction of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in the first days after germination coincides with increased _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ encoding the de novo synthesis enzyme aspartate transcarbamoylase consistent with a role for the transporter in facilitating the movement of newly synthesized nucleobases throughout the plant in order to meet metabolic demands during growth . _PROTEIN_ transcript levels increase c. ninefold by days and then _PROTEIN_ slowly perhaps in response to the oversupply of nucleobases through combined salvaging activities and increased de novo synthesis . it is interesting to note that the _PROTEIN_ profiles for the catabolic pathway genes _PROTEIN_ and bat parallel that of _PROTEIN_ . on day the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ and bat is barely detectable . by days _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ has increased by c. four to fivefold coinciding with peak _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . between days and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ remains constant whereas _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ c. threefold . an analysis of atgenexpress data in the _PROTEIN_ atlas of arabidopsis development _METHOD_ that the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ remains coordinately regulated throughout plant development . markedly increased bat _PROTEIN_ is observed between days and in arabidopsis seedlings as _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ begins to _PROTEIN_ perhaps indicating that bat may be regulated in response to intermediates or products of the catabolic pathway . reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction _PROTEIN_ profiles for genes encoding catabolic pathway enzymes _PROTEIN_ nucleobase transporters with high affinity for uracil _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ the de novo synthesis pathway enzyme aspartate transcarbamoylase _PROTEIN_ and salvage enzyme uracil phosphoribosyltransferase _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ values for each transcript relative to day and normalized on the basis of constitutively _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ are indicated below each band . arabidopsis seedlings were grown in liquid culture and harvested at the indicated number of days after germination . coordinate regulation _METHOD_ with batsupports the previous assumption that may be the bat involved in pyrimidine catabolism . coordinate regulation _METHOD_ and batwith _PROTEIN_ suggests that _PROTEIN_ activities increase in response to increasing pyrimidine levels in the tissue resulting from increased de novo synthesis activities . thus a major function for the catabolic pathway may be to regulate cellular levels of free pyrimidine nucleotides during growth and development . in addition to _PROTEIN_ pyrimidine homeostasis or recycling of nitrogen from pyrimidines it has been proposed that pyrimidine catabolism plays a major role in the production of alanine the precursor for pantothenate and coa/acyl carrier protein synthesis . in animals the catabolic pathway is the sole route for alanine synthesis but in plants alanine production from polyamine oxidation or other processes may be more important . recently have reported that ura is extensively degraded to in potato leaf tissues . although of the label resided in alanine only of the radioactivity occurred in pantothenate and of the label was found in common amino acids presumably derived from labelled c skeletons produced by bat reaction . similarly reported that and of label from and alanine respectively were found in the lipid fraction in rape seedlings being derived from the bat reaction product malic acid with further metabolism via an acetate intermediate . these findings suggest that alanine derived from ura catabolism contributes little to pantothenate synthesis in plants the vast majority of which is metabolized via bat . the marked increase in batexpression following _PROTEIN_ in developing arabidopsis seedlings is consistent with this model and suggests that the primary function of the catabolic pathway is the recycling of nitrogen from pyrimidines to general nitrogen metabolism . the role of the catabolic pathway in recycling of pyrimidine nitrogen to general nitrogen metabolism was investigated by growing seedlings with or without nitrogen and with ura as a sole nitrogen source and examining the effects on catabolic pathway activities and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . seedlings grown in vermiculite and fertilized weekly with _METHOD_ medium grew and developed normally and flowered and set seed over a wk period . seedlings grown in medium containing only mm nitrogen were much smaller and began to flower c. wk earlier than the full nitrogen control plants . seedlings fertilized with medium containing no nitrogen grew for c. d and then arrested as small rosette plants with little root growth . these plants did not flower and exhibited slight chlorosis . fertilization of seedlings with the same solution but containing mm ura as the sole nitrogen source resulted in the growth of small plants with single flower bolts with only one or two siliques however completion of their development suggests that they were able to catabolize ura relatively efficiently . gene _PROTEIN_ profiles of rosette leaves for wk old seedlings in this experiment show that moderate nitrogen limitation in mm nitrogen plants increased the _PROTEIN_ of all four _PROTEIN_ genes between two and sixfold with the _PROTEIN_ of the ura transporters _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ also strongly up regulated by c. sixfold . as shown in _PROTEIN_ mm nitrogen plants incorporated nearly twice as much label from ura as plants grown in mm nitrogen consistent with the increased _PROTEIN_ of nucleobase transporters . in mm nitrogen plants ura catabolism also increased twofold in parallel with increased _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ genes although the distribution of label in catabolic soluble and insoluble pools _PROTEIN_ as a percentage of total incorporated ura was not different in mm versus mm nitrogen plants . severe nitrogen limitation resulted in barely detectable _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ bat was not evident . in these plants _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ and the nucleoside transporter was even more strongly up regulated than in mm nitrogen plants although the total incorporated ura and percentage ura catabolism did not differ between these treatments _PROTEIN_ . by contrast plants grown with mm ura incorporated fold more labelled ura than did plants grown in mm nitrogen and c. more labelled ura than plants grown without nitrogen _PROTEIN_ despite a twofold _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ and an approximate sevenfold _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ . on a percentage total incorporated ura basis the mm ura plants catabolized nearly twice as much ura as in other treatments _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ label in soluble pools and increased label in _PROTEIN_ and insoluble pools suggest that increased catabolism of ura with recycling of pyrimidine nitrogen to general nitrogen metabolism in addition to efficient ura salvaging into pyrimidines and _LOCATION_ acids supported growth on ura as a sole nitrogen source . the observed increase in catabolic activities in plants grown in mm ura was correlated with elevated _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ transcript levels c. threefold and fold higher than in mm nitrogen plants and c. twofold higher than in mm nitrogen plants . uracil metabolism in rosette leaves of arabidopsis seedlings grown for wk in vermiculite and

gene . _PROTEIN_ values for each transcript relative to seedlings grown in mm nitrogen and normalized on the basis of _PROTEIN_ are indicated below each band . nd not detectable . a recent genome wide _PROTEIN_ analysis of primary and secondary metabolism in arabidopsis seedlings confirmed that rapid changes in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ also occur in response to changes in nitrogen availability . in liquid cultured seedlings short term moderate nitrogen limitation leads to increased _PROTEIN_ of all _PROTEIN_ and can be rapidly reversed by the addition of nitrate to the growth medium . thus it appears that both rapid and longer term _PROTEIN_ changes in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ occur in response to changes in nitrogen availability and may play an important role in balancing the needs of pyrimidine and general nitrogen metabolism . in senescing leaf tissues _PROTEIN_ are co _PROTEIN_ at very high levels and catabolic pathway activities remain high even as salvaging activities decline in tobacco leaves . it _METHOD_ likely that the release of pyrimidine nitrogen via the catabolic pathway would play a significant role in remobilization of nitrogen in senescent tissues but little appears to be known about this process . the catabolic pathway intermediate dhu induces the _PROTEIN_ of the pydbc operon encoding _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ orthologues in brevibacillus agri and dhu but not ura induces _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ genes and ureidopropionate also induces _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in s. kluyveri . by contrast the end product of the catabolic pathway _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ via nitrogen catabolite repression in s. kluyveri . in plants potential regulation of _PROTEIN_ genes by pathway intermediates or products has not been investigated previously . the kinetics of induction or repression of _PROTEIN_ gene _PROTEIN_ in response to feeding of ura dhu and in d old liquid cultured seedlings are shown in . strongly represses the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ genes two to threefold h after supplementation . after h _PROTEIN_ transcripts return to control levels whereas and _PROTEIN_ repression is still evident . after h _PROTEIN_ transcript levels are about the same as in untreated controls . ura feeding weakly increased _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ by c. to twofold by h after which transcript levels _PROTEIN_ two to threefold by h perhaps as a result of the accumulation of pathway intermediates or the end product . after h dhu had little effect on _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ but increased _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ transcript levels c. two and fold respectively . by h the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ was still c. fold higher than in control tissues unlike the observed _PROTEIN_ in the levels of these transcripts in ura treated tissues . as dhu is an intermediate in ura catabolism it is unclear why the induction of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ was stronger and sustained longer with dhu than with ura . possible differences in uptake and metabolism of the two nucleobases were not investigated . et al . have demonstrated that the _PROTEIN_ ura transporters in arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ do not transport dhu and ura differently . et al . reported that unlabelled dhu did not affect the uptake of ura but markedly reduced the catabolism of labelled ura in tomato cells consistent with dhu being an intermediate in the pathway for pyrimidine catabolism in plants . et al . also demonstrated that no labelling of ura via the potentially reversible dhpdh step was observed with labelled dhu . thus exogenous dhu may have resulted in the accumulation of ura with altered ura and dhu pool sizes and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ patterns within seedlings in the present experiment . the effects of other pathway intermediates and products on _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were not studied here . reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction _PROTEIN_ profiles for _PROTEIN_ in d old liquid cultured arabidopsis seedlings grown in murashige and skoog _METHOD_ medium with a fresh medium change at day . time h is h after the beginning of the light period when cultures received either no supplements or dihydrouracil or uracil at mm final concentration . _PROTEIN_ values for each transcript at or h after supplement addition are relative to those in control plants normalized on the basis of _PROTEIN_ and are indicated below each band . the apparent regulation of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ by pathway intermediates has not been reported previously and may represent a major mechanism for the control of catabolic pathway activities in plants . evidence for direct metabolic control of catabolic pathway enzymes is lacking . the heterologously _PROTEIN_ upase _PROTEIN_ was found to be insensitive even to mm concentrations of substrates or substrate analogues such as ureidopropionate ureidoisobutyrate and n _PROTEIN_ aspartate and to the reaction products alanine and _PROTEIN_ . plant dhpdh and dhpase have not been purified or biochemically characterized to date . metabolic regulation of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ by catabolic pathway intermediates may explain the observed _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ profiles seen in plants grown in media containing different amounts of nitrogen or in ura as the sole nitrogen source in the present study as follows . under moderate nitrogen limitation removal of resulting from its assimilation into general nitrogen metabolism may relieve the repression of _PROTEIN_ genes before the depletion of nucleotide pools as a nitrogen source . further degradation of available pyrimidines under extreme nitrogen limitation may lower their cellular titres of ura below levels that normally would induce _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ transcript levels . indeed in a similar experiment _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was unchanged in mm nitrogen treatment mm nitrogen treatment and mm ura plants but increased c. fivefold in the seedlings grown without treatment suggesting that pyrimidines were limiting for growth in these plants . increased _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ genes when ura is provided as the sole treatment source would result from the induction of _PROTEIN_ genes by ura or catabolic pathway intermediates accompanied by efficient assimilation of preventing repression of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ by this end product . the induction of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ after h of mm ura supplementation also provides a probable explanation for the apparently high ura degradation activities in seedlings grown without nitrogen _PROTEIN_ in which _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is barely detectable . catabolic pathway activity was measured over a period of h in tissues immersed in reaction buffer containing of ura mm unlabelled ura . during this time it _METHOD_ likely that ura may have induced the _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ genes resulting in higher catabolic activities than were present in the tissue when the assay was initiated . a relatively long assay time was required for intact arabidopsis tissues in which rates of incorporation and catabolism of labelled ura were relatively slow compared with those of suspension cultured cells used in some studies although considerably shorter than the incubation time of h used in a previous study with intact seedlings . lack of detectable dhpdh activity has precluded the localization of this enzyme in subcellular fractions of plant cells but dhpase and upase activities have been reported to be _LOCATION_ or _LOCATION_ in tomato cells . targeting prediction programmes based on deduced amino acid sequences for these enzymes predict a _LOCATION_ localization for dhpdh the localization of dhpase in the secretory system and a _LOCATION_ localization for upase . for conclusive localization of these enzymes in vivo we cloned c terminal _METHOD_ fusion constructs with full length coding sequences of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ genes and stably _PROTEIN_ them in arabidopsis . confocal microscopy revealed a _LOCATION_ localization of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion in agreement with the predicted _LOCATION_ localization of this enzyme . localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ within the secretory system and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in the _LOCATION_ also agrees with targeting predictions . the distribution of these enzymes within several different subcellular compartments suggests a potentially complex regulation . as nucleobases and other pathway intermediates and products have been shown to regulate _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ transporters which facilitate the movements of these molecules between these subcellular compartments may also play an important role in regulating pyrimidine degradation in plants . localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in mesophyll cells of stably transformed arabidopsis . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_

_PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ screened for homozygosity for the respective t dna insertion as described in materials and methods . in order to determine whether t dna insertions reduced respective _PROTEIN_ transcript levels quantitative real time rt pcr analyses were performed with d old seedlings grown aseptically on plates containing _METHOD_ medium and sucrose . as shown in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ transcripts were easily detected in wild type seedlings but no significant _PROTEIN_ of these genes was measured in the respective _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutants . thus they can be _PROTEIN_ as knockouts for their respective gene products . quantitative real time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction analysis of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in wild type and pyd mutants values are _PROTEIN_ as the difference in the ct value relative to that of elongation _PROTEIN_ taken to the power of efficiency . each value represents the mean standard _LOCATION_ for six individual seedlings . measurements were repeated twice . significant differences using unpaired two tailed t tests . highly significant differences . to analyse whether the absence of individual _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ results in altered _PROTEIN_ of other _PROTEIN_ genes transcript levels for all _PROTEIN_ genes were analysed in each of the pyd mutant lines . when the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ absent the _PROTEIN_ of otherpyd genes clearly remains unaffected _PROTEIN_ however disrupted _PROTEIN_ of either _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in reduced _PROTEIN_ of the other two _PROTEIN_ genes by in both mutants _PROTEIN_ . as described above feeding of wild type plants with ura or dhu intermediates and the end product of the catabolic pathway alters _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ although the precise _METHOD_ by which this occurs are unknown . the availability of arabidopsis pydmutants will facilitate analyses of the metabolic regulation of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in the future . to analyse whether other genes involved in pyrimidine nucleotide metabolism are affected by altered _PROTEIN_ gene _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ of genes encoding enzymes involved in de novo synthesis phosphotransfer reactions and pyrimidine salvaging was measured . _PROTEIN_ of all genes could be detected in d old wild type plants grown under normal conditions on _METHOD_ medium containing sucrose . as none of the pydmutants exhibit a phenotype it is not surprising that differences in _PROTEIN_ levels for most tested transcripts are relatively minor compared with wild type plants . nevertheless markedly increased _PROTEIN_ of all de novo pathway genes is seen in _PROTEIN_ mutants . up regulation of these genes in _PROTEIN_ mutants _METHOD_ counter intuitive potentially increased de novo synthesis in tissues with limited pyrimidine catabolism . other significant _PROTEIN_ data for _PROTEIN_ include a two to threefold increase in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ encoding uridine nucleosidases which metabolize uridine to ura a twofold coordinately down regulated _PROTEIN_ of putative dual domain uridine kinase/ura phosphoribosyltransferases and which catalyse the formation of ump from ura and uridine a more than twofold up regulation of _PROTEIN_ which would be expected to increase uprtase activities and salvaging of ura to ump . it has been reported from various plant species that uridine is more efficiently salvaged than ura . this is attributed in part to markedly higher uridine cytidine kinase activities compared with those of uprtase and to low or undetectable uridine nucleosidase activities . the altered salvage pathway gene _PROTEIN_ profiles in the _PROTEIN_ mutants are consistent with a _PROTEIN_ ability to salvage uridine to ump and increased conversion of uridine to ura . this difference may explain the observed accumulation of ura in these plants compared with _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants . the reasons for these dynamic changes in synthesis and salvage pathway gene _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ mutants with reduced catabolic pathway activities but not in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ lines in which catabolic activities are essentially absent are unclear and will require further investigation . relative transcript levels of pyrimidine nucleotide metabolism genes in pyd mutants . arabidopsis seedlings grown on plates containing half strength murashige and skoog _METHOD_ medium with sucrose were analysed by quantitative real time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction . values are calculated as the difference of the ct value from taken to the power of efficiency . each bar represents the _PROTEIN_ of the gene in question in the respective mutant relative to the _PROTEIN_ in the wild type . each bar represents the mean values of six individual seedlings . measurements were repeated twice . significant differences using unpaired two tailed t tests are marked with an asterisk . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ synthase small subunit ec

nucleosidase ec . in order to determine whether the absence of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ results in altered ura metabolism we measured pyrimidine levels of pyd mutants grown for d in liquid culture . although pyrimidine nucleotide and uridine levels are unchanged in all pyd mutants there is a strong and significant accumulation of ura with the largest increase occurring in _PROTEIN_ . although control plants contain ura fw _PROTEIN_ mutants accumulate _PROTEIN_ mutants and _PROTEIN_ mutants ura fw respectively . we further analysed radiolabelled metabolite profiles after feeding of ura to liquid cultured seedlings . shows that in wild type _PROTEIN_ plants of incorporated ura is catabolized to . in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants ura degradation is nearly undetectable and possible _METHOD_ by which a small amount of ura is apparently catabolized to in these mutants are unknown . the absence of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ transcripts in these plants _PROTEIN_ and their inability to grow on ura as a sole nitrogen source clearly confirm that ura degradation in plants is dependent on the activities of dhpase _PROTEIN_ and upase _PROTEIN_ . this also demonstrates that the arabidopsis homologue to the recently described completely different and unrelated _PROTEIN_ gene encoding alanine synthase from s. kluyveri is not able to substitute the missing upase _PROTEIN_ in the _PROTEIN_ mutants . growth of wild type _PROTEIN_ and pyd mutant arabidopsis plants in sterile culture on media containing either no nitrogen or mm uracil . complete rosettes

ura . the size of the circle represents the amount of ura that was taken up by the respective seedling culture . by contrast of incorporated ura was released as by the _PROTEIN_ mutant representing only a _PROTEIN_ in catabolic pathway activity compared with wild type plants . the strongly reduced catabolism of ura in the _PROTEIN_ mutant unequivocally demonstrates the involvement of _PROTEIN_ in pyrimidine degradation . however significant production of in the _PROTEIN_ mutant suggests an incomplete loss of _PROTEIN_ function or the possibility of additional unknown _METHOD_ for ura catabolism in arabidopsis . in comparison with wild type plants none of the mutants exhibited obvious growth or developmental differences under normal growing conditions in either sterile culture or on soil . in order to further confirm the importance of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ for ura degradation and the role of the catabolic pathway in the recycling of nitrogen from nucleobases to general nitrogen metabolism wild type and pyd mutant seedlings were grown on media containing either no nitrogen or mm ura as a sole nitrogen source . as shown in growth of all plants on medium without nitrogen was not significantly different and limited seedling growth can be explained by the salvaging of seed nitrogen reserves and the small amount of nitrogen in the vitamin solution . growth of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ plants in medium containing ura as the sole nitrogen source was not significantly different from that in the medium without nitrogen unequivocally demonstrating that without _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ function ura degradation is not possible in plants . interestingly _PROTEIN_ mutants were able to grow on mm ura medium clearly supporting limited ura catabolism in these plants _PROTEIN_ . compilation of the genes and mutants of the reductive pathway of pyrimidine degradation in arabidopsis thaliana including a summary of the mutant phenotypes nd not determined . although t dna insertions within genes frequently result in a complete loss of function associated with the protein product our initial determination that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was absent from _PROTEIN_ mutants _PROTEIN_ was based on the use of pcr primers that amplified sequences downstream of the t dna insertion site . if _PROTEIN_ transcripts terminating at the insertion site produced truncated functional _PROTEIN_ proteins with reduced dhpdh activity this might explain the apparent ura catabolism in these mutants . in plants that had been grown on soil for wk we used quantitative real time rt pcr to analyse the possible existence of in the _PROTEIN_ mutants using three primer pairs to detect transcripts upstream of the t dna insertions and a primer pair downstream of the insertion . as shown in _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ transcript was not present when the primer pair downstream of the insertions was used for amplification . amplification using primer pairs upstream of the insertions indicated that the _PROTEIN_ of truncated transcripts did occur at levels representing c. of those seen in wild type plants . in the _PROTEIN_ mutant the t dna insertion is in intron whereas in _PROTEIN_ the insertion is at the beginning of exon . quantitative real time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction analysis of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in congeneric wild type and _PROTEIN_ mutants values are _PROTEIN_ as the difference in the ct value relative to that of to the power of efficiency . each value represents the mean standard _LOCATION_ for three individual seedlings . measurements were repeated twice . analysis of the _PROTEIN_ gene indicates that in either _PROTEIN_ line transcripts terminating at the t dna insertion site could potentially include coding regions of exons encoding _PROTEIN_ proteins truncated at or before residue . searches for motifs and conserved domains revealed that such truncated _PROTEIN_ would not include the complete dhpdh ura/flavin mononucleotide binding domain including active site residues and or two highly conserved subunit interaction domains . thus it is very unlikely that the truncated _PROTEIN_ proteins would be functional based on structural studies with animal dhpdh although dhpdh activities for such proteins can not be precluded at this time . as _PROTEIN_ antibodies are presently unavailable it was not possible to determine whether truncated _PROTEIN_ proteins were even made in the _PROTEIN_ mutants . previous investigators have been unable to measure dhpdh in plant extracts or for heterologously _PROTEIN_ arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ protein or brevibacillus agri pyda . this may be explained by the absence of an n terminal domain containing fes clusters and nad h and flavin adenine dinucleotide cofactor binding sites in the plant _PROTEIN_ and bacterial pyda sequences . as this compulsory interaction partner required for the activity of plant _PROTEIN_ has not yet been identified it is not possible to elucidate putative alternative partners in the _PROTEIN_ mutant background . we further investigated the role of _PROTEIN_ in plant pyrimidine catabolism using rnai mediated silencing of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . the rnai lines would be expected to produce markedly _PROTEIN_ levels of a full length presumably fully functional _PROTEIN_ protein . in strongly silenced lines _PROTEIN_ transcript levels were reduced by but ura catabolism was _PROTEIN_ by only compared with wild type plants . again these observations support a role for _PROTEIN_ in ura catabolism but as in studies with _PROTEIN_ mutants the absence of assays for dhpdh activity labelling kinetic data etc . do not permit us to differentiate between dhpdh mediated ura reduction and ura reduction via additional unknown activities . if such alternative non _PROTEIN_ mediated ura reduction activities exist in plants they would require the formation of dhu and ureidopropionate intermediates in ura catabolism based on previous metabolic labelling studies and the observation that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants can not grow on ura as a nitrogen source whereas _PROTEIN_ mutants can . the only closely related sequence to _PROTEIN_ in the arabidopsis genome is dihydroorotate dehydrogenase the enzyme catalysing the fourth step in the pyrimidine de novo synthesis . it has been shown that this plant enzyme is located at the outer side of the inner mitochondrial _LOCATION_ and there is no further evidence that it might also be involved in pyrimidine degradation . an interesting parallel is seen in the yeast s. kluyveri which has functional _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and can utilize dhu as a nitrogen source . in contrast with the situation in plants however _PROTEIN_ orthologues have not been identified in this yeast and ura catabolism occurs via a newly described pathway that does not produce dhu as an intermediate . apparently the truncated _PROTEIN_ reductive pathway is an evolutionary relic that no longer functions in normal ura catabolism in this organism . other alternative pathways for pyrimidine catabolism have been described in bacteria . exhaustive searches of plant genomes have not revealed plant orthologues of genes and enzymes in these bacterial or yeast pathways . further biochemical and metabolic labelling studies and the development of assays for dhpdh activity and enzyme protein _PROTEIN_ and the functional characterization of heterologously _PROTEIN_ dhpdh are required to more fully understand the role of this enzyme in ura catabolism in plants . during growth and development the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ genes is coordinated with the _PROTEIN_ of genes encoding de novo and salvage synthesis pathway enzymes presumably to _PROTEIN_ pyrimidine homeostasis in response to changing metabolic demands . the catabolic pathway does not appear to be essential under normal growing conditions as pyd mutants exhibit no obvious phenotype . under conditions of nitrogen limitation the pathway appears to play a major role in the recycling of pyrimidine nitrogen to general nitrogen metabolism . metabolic regulation of catabolic pathway genes including the induction of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ by ura and dhu and repression by the end product is similar to that described in other _METHOD_ . functional analyses of pyrimidine catabolism in arabidopsis have demonstrated that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and to a lesser extent _PROTEIN_ play essential roles in ura catabolism in this plant although an unknown alternative route for ura catabolism may also be present . localization of catabolic pathway enzymes in different subcellular compartments suggests a potentially complex regulation of genes and enzymes by pathway intermediates and end products about which little is currently known .
