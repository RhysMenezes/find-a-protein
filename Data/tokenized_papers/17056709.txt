two homologous plant specific arabidopsis thaliana genes _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ belong to a new family of glycosyltransferases _PROTEIN_ and encode cell wall d xylosyltransferases . the deduced amino acid sequences contain single transmembrane domains near the n terminus indicative of a type ii _LOCATION_ protein structure . soluble secreted _METHOD_ of the corresponding proteins _PROTEIN_ in insect cells showed xylosyltransferase activity transferring d xylose from udp d xylose to l fucose . the disaccharide product was hydrolyzed by xylosidase whereas no reaction was catalyzed by xylosidase . furthermore the regio and stereochemistry of the methyl xylosyl fucoside was determined by _LOCATION_ magnetic resonance to be an linkage demonstrating the isolated glycosyltransferases to be d xylosyltransferases . this particular linkage is only known in rhamnogalacturonan ii a complex polysaccharide essential to vascular plants and is conserved across higher plant families . rhamnogalacturonan ii isolated from both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ t dna insertional mutants functioned as specific acceptor molecules in the xylosyltransferase assay . _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ enhanced green _METHOD_ protein constructs in arabidopsis revealed that both fusion proteins were targeted to a brefeldin a sensitive compartment and also colocalized with the _LOCATION_ marker dye bodipy tr ceramide consistent with targeting to the _LOCATION_ apparatus . taken together these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ encode _LOCATION_ localized d xylosyltransferases involved in the biosynthesis of pectic rhamnogalacturonan ii .
the uniqueness and complexity of plant cw polysaccharide structures have made identification of cw _PROTEIN_ by simple homology approaches impracticable . in addition the very limited number of donor and especially acceptor substrates has further hampered the identification of novel plant cw _PROTEIN_ . as a significant proportion of arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ probably remains to be classified we developed a bioinformatic filtering strategy aimed at identifying unclassified cw _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis . as a result putative _PROTEIN_ were identified and two of these gave rise to a new family in cazy _PROTEIN_ . the two genes designated _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were selected for the functional characterization presented here . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ encode polypeptides of and amino acids respectively and are identical at the amino acid level . the two genes are located closely together on chromosome separated by only kb . in the arabidopsis genome many homologous genes are situated in clusters created by recent local duplications thus it is likely that the two genes are paralogs . the deduced amino acid sequences of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ contain a single tmd in the n terminus _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and adopt a type ii _LOCATION_ protein structure typical of _LOCATION_ located _PROTEIN_ . both proteins contain a dxd motif flanked by hydrophobic residues situated approximately in the middle of the deduced amino acid sequences _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ which in several crystal structures has been shown to be the site of interaction with the uridine diphosphate of the donor substrate via a metal cation . two similar sequences in arabidopsis _GENE_ and _GENE_ are to identical with _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . est sequences with pronounced similarity to this small gene family have been detected in various plants for example oryza sativa gossypium arboreum lycopersicon esculentum _PROTEIN_ brassica napus beta vulgaris prunus persica allium cepa citrus sinensis glycine max medicago truncatula populus alba populus tremula saccharum officinarum _PROTEIN_ ipomoea nil and mesembryanthemum crystallinum . homologous sequences from _METHOD_ outside the plant kingdom have not been found . soluble secreted _METHOD_ of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were _PROTEIN_ in baculovirus transfected insect cells . one of the _PROTEIN_ experimental difficulties in determining the catalytic function of _PROTEIN_ relates to the limited availability of relevant candidate oligosaccharide acceptors . however the range of possible acceptor structures can be narrowed down by exploiting the observation that monosaccharides can serve as acceptor analogs if provided at high concentrations in the _PROTEIN_ assay also denoted as the free sugar assay . by combining available donor nucleoside diphosphate sugars and monosaccharide acceptors in the free sugar assay heterologously _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ protein were shown to catalyze the transfer of d xylose from udp d xyl onto l fucose and with lower efficiency d xyl onto l arabinose . all other combinations with the donor ndp sugars _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and monosaccharide acceptors _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ did not result in the formation of radioactive products . thus both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ encode xylosyltransferases using udp d xyl specifically as donor substrate transferring d xyl onto l fuc and less efficiently onto l ara . d xyl was only incorporated at high l ara concentrations whereas no transfer occurred at low concentrations compared with when l fuc was used as acceptor . xylose linked to arabinose is a rare epitope in the plant cw and has so far only been found in arabinoxylan of cinnamomum zeylanium . the arabinose residue is in the furanose form _PROTEIN_ in this case and l _PROTEIN_ is generally much more abundant in the cw than arabinose in pyranose form . the equilibrium between l _PROTEIN_ and l arap in the free sugar assay is driven toward l arap . to test if l _PROTEIN_ would work as an efficient acceptor substrate we chose l arabinobiose as a substrate featuring an l _PROTEIN_ at the nonreducing end . no incorporation of xylose was observed and we therefore decided to focus on l fuc as the acceptor . the stereochemistry of the glycosidic linkage of the product obtained after incubation of _PROTEIN_ with udp d xyl and l fuc was determined by treating the product with either or xylosidase and analyzing the reaction mixture by size exclusion chromatography _PROTEIN_ . only xylosidase released d xyl from the product showing that _PROTEIN_ is a retaining _PROTEIN_ . the chemical structure of the product formed in the free sugar assay using methyl l fucoside as acceptor was resolved by _LOCATION_ magnetic resonance . the disaccharide product was purified by _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ guided fractionation using hplc . the peak displaying the expected molecular _METHOD_ of the sodium adduct at a _METHOD_ to charge ratio of was collected and used in the nmr experiments presented in supplemental figure online . both one and two dimensional spectra were recorded double quantum filtered correlated spectroscopy chemical shift correlation j resolved spectroscopy heteronuclear single quantum coherence _PROTEIN_ and heteronuclear multiple bond correlation . the chemical shifts and coupling constants are given in table . the point of xylose attachment to the fucose moiety was evident from two hmbc cross peaks xylose fucose and fucose xylose . in addition there was an ppm downfield shift of in the fucose moiety relative to in unsubstituted methyl l fucoside . the small coupling constant of hz of the anomeric xylose proton is diagnostic of the linkage . the anomeric proton of the fucose was hidden by the hod peak but its coupling constant could be derived at hz from the coupling constants of confirming an untouched configuration of the methyl l fucoside . all chemical shifts were in acceptable accordance with the monomeric reference compounds methyl d xyloside and methyl l fucoside . the cross peak at in the hmbc spectrum corresponds to xylose xylose proving that the xylose is in pyranose form which also can be seen from the data where the shifts are below ppm . nmr spectral data of methyl d xylopyranosyl l fucopyranoside in taken together the nmr data revealed the regio and stereochemistry of the methyl xylosyl fucoside to be an linkage . the only known plant oligo or polysaccharide featuring an d linked xyl l fuc structure is in the a chain of pectic rg ii . the linkage between l fuc and l rha in the rg ii a chain prompted us to examine various acceptors containing linked l fuc . the smallest possible increment in acceptor size is the methyl fucoside which comprises a glycosidic bond and at the same time fixes the anomeric configuration . therefore methyl and l fuc were chemically synthesized . methyl l fuc was found to be an times more efficient acceptor than free l fuc whereas methyl l fuc did not lead to any d xyl incorporation . thus the preference for an glycosidic bond of l fuc appeared to be absolute as acceptor for both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . the next obvious acceptor increment the l fuc l rha disaccharide was prepared by chemical synthesis and this acceptor was found to be a slightly better acceptor than free l fuc . to investigate the possible influence of the anomeric configuration of the l rha moiety the methyl glycosides of the disaccharide methyl l fucosyl l rhamnoside and methyl l fucosyl l rhamnoside were synthesized and tested as acceptors . both worked to times better than l fuc l rha but no significant differences were found between the and _METHOD_ of the methyl glycosides . l fuc d glcnac which features the same linkage as l fuc l rha was approximately half as efficient as l fuc l rha . the two fucosyl d lactose trisaccharides in which l fuc is conjugated to either the d gal or d glc residue at the o or o position respectively were found to be less efficient acceptors than l fuc d glcnac . in conclusion _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ prefer l fuc being linked to the o position of the adjacent sugar over linkages to the o and o positions . the level of incorporation of d xyl onto l fuc l rha was one third of the incorporation obtained with methyl l fuc which is somewhat unexpected given the predicted involvement of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in the synthesis of the d xyl l fuc l rha structure in rg ii . possible explanations for this apparent discrepancy are presented in the discussion . if both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are involved in the synthesis of the rg ii a chain and the two genes do not fully complement one another mutants harboring t dna insertion in either _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ might feature a rg ii population in which the methylated d xyl residue is reduced or missing . t dna insertional mutants for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ with insertions in the last exon and in the first intron of the two genes respectively as determined by sequencing from the t dna left border were selected for this investigation . three _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and two _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ homozygous plants for mutation of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ respectively were identified by pcr the phenotype scored and the sugar composition of the cw fractions determined . no obvious morphological differences between the wild type and mutants were observed . the o methyl d xyl residue is diagnostic of rg ii and could be detected in alcohol insoluble residues from rosette leaves by gas chromatography electro ionization _METHOD_ but the concentration was too low to permit precise quantification . rg ii enriched preparations were therefore made from the wild type and mutants and analyzed . the sugar composition from the isolated rg ii revealed that no statistically significant changes were caused by the t dna insertion in either _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ . apparently the mutation in either gene did not eliminate the o methyl d xyl residue probably because the other gene product compensated for the dysfunction of the mutated xylosyltransferase gene . a similar case has been observed for t dna insertional mutants of udp d api/udp d xylose synthase _PROTEIN_ of which arabidopsis contains at least two homologous genes . sugar composition of rg ii isolated from wild type and t dna insertional mutants of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ radiochemical transferase assays are more sensitive than chemical analysis of monosaccharide profiles and it was therefore decided to characterize the mutant rg iis for their ability to serve as acceptor substrates . the preparations of rg ii from the wild type _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ listed in table were used for acceptor substrate studies . both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ catalyzed transfer of d xyl to the rg ii preparation from the _PROTEIN_ t dna insertional mutant plants and at a higher level to rg ii from the _PROTEIN_ t dna insertional mutant plants . xylosidase very efficiently removed _PROTEIN_ incorporated d xyl from the rg ii of both t dna insertional mutants . wild type rg ii did not work as an acceptor and a control insect supernatant containing the soluble secreted form of cazy _PROTEIN_ family _GENE_ did not transfer d xyl to the mutant rg iis . in conclusion the mutant rg iis were not identical to the wild type counterpart although the differences were below the detection limits of our chemical analysis and both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ catalyzed the transfer of d xyl to rg ii isolated from both t dna insertional mutants which suggests that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are xylosyltransferases involved in the synthesis of the d xyl l fuc l rha structure in pectic rg ii . the levels of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ transcripts in various tissues were investigated using rt pcr . whereas a strong rrna derived band was obtained neither _PROTEIN_ nor _PROTEIN_ derived transcripts were detectable after cycles of pcr . after cycles of pcr amplification both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mrnas were detected . _PROTEIN_ mrna was found in root and rosette leaves and _PROTEIN_ was detected in root rosette leaves stem and flower and generally appeared to be _PROTEIN_ at a higher level . rna gel blot analysis was not sensitive enough to detect the transcripts in any of the selected tissues . blast searches with the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ cdna sequences at the national center for biotechnology information revealed the existence of a limited number of ests derived from root leaf flower seedlings and mixed tissues of various developmental stages . the ests could rarely be assigned with certainty to _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ because of the high similarity of the two genes . the subcellular location of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ was investigated by c terminal fusions of the full length coding regions to the enhanced green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ alone as a control . after biolistic particle bombardments of wild type arabidopsis rosette leaves cells _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein displayed _METHOD_ _METHOD_ in small vesicles similar to those of other _LOCATION_ localized enzymes . the same pattern was observed for the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein . _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ alone showed diffused _METHOD_ in the _LOCATION_ and in particular in the cytoplasm surrounding the _LOCATION_ a clearly distinct pattern from that of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein . the _METHOD_ structures were investigated further by treatment with brefeldin a . bfa is a lipophilic fungal toxin known to block vesicular transport in the secretory pathway between the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and the _LOCATION_ and between _LOCATION_ and the trans _LOCATION_ network . in some cases bfa also induces vesiculation and disassembly of the _LOCATION_ apparatus . when cells were treated with bfa the labeling pattern in the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ bombarded cells changed from a clear pattern of well defined bodies in the untreated control to a pattern of diffuse and disassembled vesicles as would be expected for _LOCATION_ localized proteins . a similar difference between treated and untreated cells was observed for _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . _LOCATION_ location was further corroborated using a ceramide stain recommended for labeling the _LOCATION_ apparatus in plants . bodipy tr ceramide produces selective staining of the _LOCATION_ complex and can easily be observed by confocal laser scanning microscopy _PROTEIN_ . bodipy tr staining of transgenic arabidopsis cells _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein matched perfectly when the two images were merged showing that the fusion protein colocalized with the bodipy tr dye . again similar results were obtained with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . in conclusion both the bfa and the bodipy tr results are consistent with targeting to the _LOCATION_ apparatus .

synthesis of l fucopyranosyl l rhamnopyranose and its methyl glycosides is outlined in figure which involves the conversion of l rha into the suitable glycosyl acceptors and the conversion of l fuc into a suitable glycosyl donor . recently we reported a short and practical methodology for conversion of unprotected sugars into the corresponding phenyl o benzylidene per o acetylated trans thioglycosides . this protocol was successfully applied to convert l rha into the glycosyl acceptors o benzylidene l rhamnopyranoside derivatives . based on the same approach l fuc was modified and converted in five steps into the glycosyl donor tri o benzyl l fucopyranosyl fluoride . the glycosidation reaction between and was achieved using the activator silver perchlorate tin dichloride system
