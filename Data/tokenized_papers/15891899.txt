the synthesis of noncellulosic polysaccharides and glycoproteins in the plant cell _LOCATION_ apparatus requires udp galactose as a substrate . we have cloned and characterized a nucleotide sugar transporter from arabidopsis thaliana heynh . named _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ in tobacco and saccharomyces cerevisiae and subsequent biochemical characterization indicate that _PROTEIN_ transports udp galactose but not udp _PROTEIN_ udp n acetyl _PROTEIN_ udp xylose udp _PROTEIN_ acid gdp fucose or gdp mannose . experiments _PROTEIN_ an _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein in onion epidermal cells suggest that _PROTEIN_ is located in the _LOCATION_ apparatus . finally northern analysis indicates that the _PROTEIN_ transcript was more abundant in roots and calli although it was also present in other arabidopsis organs but at lower levels . therefore _PROTEIN_ is a nucleotide sugar transporter capable of transporting udp galactose that may play an important role in the synthesis of galactose containing glycoconjugates in arabidopsis .
_PROTEIN_ was identified by sequence similarity at the amino acidic level to _PROTEIN_ a nst from arabidopsis and nsts from other species . _PROTEIN_ is identical to _PROTEIN_ and analysis of the _PROTEIN_ sequence with multiple transmembrane domain predicting _METHOD_ predicts the presence of _LOCATION_ spanning regions a characteristic of other nsts . since all nsts reported so far have their n and c termini facing the _LOCATION_ it is likely that _PROTEIN_ may possess eight or ten tmds . comparative analysis of several nsts which have been functionally characterized demonstrates that it is difficult to predict their precise substrate specificity especially for udp sugars based upon overall sequence similarity . figure shows the relationship in an unrooted phylogenetic tree of functionally characterized nsts and it can be seen that in contrast to that observed for nsts that transport gdp mannose nsts that use the same udp sugars can be located in different branches of the tree . in addition nsts that have different substrate specificities may be located in the same branch of the tree . this is the case of _PROTEIN_ that is in the same branch as the kluveromyces lactis udp n acetyl _PROTEIN_ transporter a s. cerevisiae udp galactose transporter and the arabidopsis udp _PROTEIN_ galactose transporter _PROTEIN_ . therefore based exclusively on sequence similarity it is not possible to determine the substrate specificity of _PROTEIN_ although we predicted that udp rather than gdp sugars are its most likely substrates . since udp sugars may be used within all plant cells we looked at the _PROTEIN_ pattern of _PROTEIN_ . northern analysis showed that a single band of kb was detected which is consistent with the length of the predicted cdna . the _PROTEIN_ transcript was more abundant in roots and calli however the transcript was also present in all organs analyzed but to a lower level . these results suggest that the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ is differentially regulated and also higher in cells that are continuously dividing . to determine if _PROTEIN_ encodes a functional nst and its substrate specificity we transiently _PROTEIN_ a myc his epitope tagged version of _PROTEIN_ in tobacco leaves . after subcellular fractionation a protein was detected by anti his antisera in _LOCATION_ rich vesicles isolated from leaves infiltrated with _PROTEIN_ myc his and not from the empty vector control . the molecular _METHOD_ of the protein detected was lower than the expected molecular _METHOD_ predicted from the primary sequence plus the myc his epitope . we believe that the hydrophobicity of _PROTEIN_ is the reason for the aberrant mobility a phenomenon also observed for other nsts . a panel of radioactive substrates was used to measure the uptake of ndp sugars into the vesicles obtained from tobacco _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ myc his . uptake of udp galactose was fold higher in the vesicles obtained from tobacco _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ myc his than in the control . in contrast no statistically significant increase in nucleotide sugar uptake was observed in vesicles obtained from tobacco _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ myc his when udp _PROTEIN_ udp n acetyl _PROTEIN_ udp xylose udp _PROTEIN_ acid gdp fucose or gdp mannose were used as substrates . to confirm that _PROTEIN_ transport udp galactose we _PROTEIN_ a myc his tagged version of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in s. cerevisiae . _LOCATION_ enriched fractions were obtained from both yeast _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ myc his and yeast transformed with the empty vector . transport of udp galactose was two fold higher in the vesicles obtained from yeast _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ myc his than in the control . in contrast no statistically significant increase in nucleotide sugar transport was observed in vesicles obtained from yeast _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ myc his when udp _PROTEIN_ was used as substrate . the studies _PROTEIN_ transiently _PROTEIN_ in tobacco leaves suggested that _PROTEIN_ nst activity is functional in the _LOCATION_ apparatus . to obtain further evidence relating to the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ in planta we constructed a chimera between _PROTEIN_ and the green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ . this fusion construct was transformed into onion epidermal cells using biolistics . the pattern of _METHOD_ was observed using _METHOD_ and confocal microscopy and compared to the pattern of _METHOD_ hdel _LOCATION_ or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _LOCATION_ . _METHOD_ analysis showed that the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ produced a pattern of _METHOD_ dots along with _METHOD_ fibers that crossed the cell . these _METHOD_ dots moved throughout the cell . the pattern observed for _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ shows several features similar to those observed in both _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ markers . this was seen more clearly using confocal microscopy . confocal images of onion epidermal cells _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ presented a distribution of dotted and reticulated patterns . to analyze whether the moving dots were due to the localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ at the _LOCATION_ apparatus we treated the cells with brefeldin a a drug that is known to change the localization of proteins at the _LOCATION_ to the _LOCATION_ . figure shows that this treatment changed the _METHOD_ pattern of the moving dots and only _METHOD_ fibers resembling the _LOCATION_ were observed . the size of the motile particles and the sensitivity to brefeldin a suggest that the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ is located at the _LOCATION_ apparatus .
