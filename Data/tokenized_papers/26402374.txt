turnip yellows virus a phloem limited virus encodes a kda protein known as the readthrough protein involved in virus movement . we show here that a tuyv mutant deleted of the c terminal part of the rt protein was affected in long distance trafficking in a host specific manner . by using the c terminal domain of the rt protein as a bait in a yeast two hybrid screen of a phloem cdna library from arabidopsis thaliana we identified the calcineurin b like protein interacting protein kinase . transient _PROTEIN_ of a _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion protein in virus inoculated nicotiana benthamiana leaves led to local increase of wild type tuyv accumulation but not that of tuyv cter . surprisingly elevated virus titer in inoculated leaves did not result in higher tuyv accumulation in systemic leaves which indicates that virus long distance movement was not affected . since _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was localized in or near plasmodesmata _PROTEIN_ could negatively regulate tuyv export from infected cells .
to investigate more precisely the function of the c terminal domain of the tuyv rt protein in the virus cycle a deletion was introduced downstream of a position identified by _METHOD_ _METHOD_ as the last c terminal amino acid of the rt . the deletion starts at glutamine at position since we previously showed that a nucleotide sequence encompassing lysine was strictly required for the readthrough mechanism of the cp and ends at the last amino acid of the rt protein . the deletion was generated in the rt sequence of tuyv nm a wild type virus variant in which two unique restriction sites were introduced into the rt sequence . the deletion mutant designed hereafter as tuyv cter was lacking the c terminal amino acids of the rt protein . in vitro synthesized transcripts of tuyv cter were fully competent for replication in plant protoplasts and produced a truncated rt protein of about kda migrating slightly above the rt . to address the ability of tuyv cter to infect whole plants the virus mutant was introduced into a binary vector under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus promoter and inoculated to different plant species . when assayed by das elisa tuyv cter accumulated in agroinfiltrated leaves of montia perfoliata and n. benthamiana at a level close to tuyv nm and tuyv wt . this comparable accumulation in m. perfoliata was confirmed by western blot showing similar levels of cp accumulation in leaves infiltrated with tuyv wt or tuyv cter . virus titer was then measured on young non inoculated leaves of m. perfoliata a. thaliana and n. benthamiana weeks after inoculation . tuyv cter was infectious in m. perfoliata and a. thaliana however at a lower level compared to tuyv wt and nm but the mutant was unable to systemically infect n. benthamiana . tuyv cter accumulation in systemic leaves of m. perfoliata remained at a low level during eight weeks in three independent experiments . in contrast to what was previously reported for a plrv mutant lacking the c terminal part of the rt protein tuyv cter was unable to escape from phloem cells . our results show that long distance movement of tuyv cter is reduced or even completely inhibited as observed in n. benthamiana suggesting an important function of rt cter in long distance movement of tuyv . moreover this function _METHOD_ host specific . in order to unravel the function of rt cter in the phloem restricted infection cycle of tuyv we looked for cellular partners of this viral domain . a phloem enriched cdna library of a. thaliana was directly constructed in saccharomyces cerevisiae strain using total rna extracted from companion cell protoplasts . these phloem enriched cells were isolated from transgenic a. thaliana _PROTEIN_ the _METHOD_ under the control of the _PROTEIN_ companion cell promoter . _METHOD_ protoplasts were sorted by _METHOD_ activated cell sorting and sorting efficacy was controlled by measuring _PROTEIN_ of companion cell specific genes by real time pcr . the cdna library cloned into the vector contained an average insert size of about nucleotides and had a titer of cfu/ml . the tuyv rt cter was _PROTEIN_ as a fusion with the dna binding domain in yeast strain and subsequently used as a bait . screening of the phloem cdna library was performed by yeast mating . a cdna clone encoding the c terminal sequence of the _PROTEIN_ from a. thaliana referred thereafter as _PROTEIN_ was identified as a potential interacting partner of the viral domain . _PROTEIN_ interacting protein kinases are a group of serine/threonine protein kinases that interact with the ca sensors calcineurin b like proteins _PROTEIN_ . is _PROTEIN_ in all cell types including phloem cells . vascular _PROTEIN_ of this gene was confirmed by analyzing rnaseq data from a. thaliana companion cells enriched rna . to confirm the interaction the plasmid bearing the partial cdna sequence _PROTEIN_ was introduced into yeast strain together with rt cter . serial dilutions of the co transformed cells were plated onto a medium lacking leucine and tryptophan to allow yeast growth after transformation and onto the medium to select yeast cells in which in vivo interactions occurred . interestingly we observed that rt cter was able to interact with the full length a protein of amino acids but not with the first n terminal amino acids of . no yeast growth was observed on medium when rt cter was co transformed with empty or pgad.gh vectors . these results show that rt cter preferentially binds a region localized at the c terminus of . this interaction was specific because no binding was recorded in yeast between the c terminal domain of and the major and minor coat proteins of tuyv . interaction between and the complete rt protein could not be assessed because the full length readthrough domain of the protein activated transcription of both and reporter genes when _PROTEIN_ alone . to confirm the physical interaction between the c terminal domain of and the rt cter _METHOD_ was fused to the n terminus of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ transiently with _METHOD_ rt cter by agroinfiltration in n. benthamiana . the cell extracts were immunopurified with anti _METHOD_ beads to pull down _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ complexes and the immunoprecipitated products were fractionated by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and detected with anti _METHOD_ or anti _METHOD_ antibodies . _METHOD_ rt cter of kda expected molecular weight was detected in the leaf extracts together with a larger product of ca kda which may correspond to a post translational modified form of the protein . the two products corresponding to _METHOD_ rt cter were detected in the immunocaptured complex together with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . no such products were present in the leaf extracts infiltrated with _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ rt cter . to verify that the complex formation was due to an interaction of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ with rt cter and not with _METHOD_ we performed the same assay replacing the _METHOD_ rt cter construct by _METHOD_ in the agroinfiltration experiment . no _METHOD_ protein was immunoprecipitated when _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was present confirming the specific interaction between _PROTEIN_ and rt cter . the presence of the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ on the anti _METHOD_ beads was moreover confirmed by the detection of the fusion protein of kda in the leaf extracts infiltrated with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ construct . this experiment confirmed that _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ interacts with rt cter . to address the function of in the tuyv cycle we first analyzed virus accumulation in an a. thaliana _PROTEIN_ knock out mutant . the t dna insertion encompasses the terminal coding and non coding sequences of . the absence of mrna detection in the _PROTEIN_ mutant was confirmed by rt pcr . homozygous plants were inoculated with tuyv using viruliferous aphids and viral accumulation was measured three weeks post inoculation in the non inoculated leaves by das elisa . in two independent experiments no significant difference in virus accumulation was observed in _PROTEIN_ when compared with tuyv accumulation in col . genome analysis identified at least cipk genes in a. thaliana and _PROTEIN_ displays the highest homology with _PROTEIN_ . functional redundancy between the different cipk proteins is likely which may explain the absence of differential virus accumulation between _PROTEIN_ and col plants . in another set of experiments we investigated the effect of overexpression of on tuyv accumulation . n. benthamiana leaves were co infiltrated with a tuyv full length clone together with the fusion construct where _METHOD_ was placed at the n terminus of the protein _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . as controls leaves were co infiltrated with the viral clone and the free _METHOD_ or the fused to _METHOD_ at its c terminus _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . _PROTEIN_ of the _METHOD_ fusion proteins was confirmed by western blot three days after infiltration . virus accumulation could not be assessed in infiltrated leaves by real time rt pcr because of the presence of viral transcripts deriving from the cauliflower mosaic virus promoter provided by the recombinant agrobacteria . we therefore used das elisa to evaluate virus titer since the structural proteins are _PROTEIN_ from the sub genomic rna and thus substantiate genuine viral replication . when tuyv was co _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or with free _METHOD_ no statistical difference in virus accumulation was observed three days post inoculation in infiltrated tissue . conversely when _METHOD_ was positioned at the n terminus of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ releasing a free c terminus co _PROTEIN_ of this protein with the virus caused a significant increase in tuyv accumulation in infiltrated tissue . this fostering local effect of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ on the tuyv titer was observed in three additional independent experiments with a significant virus increase when the fusion protein was present . in order to evaluate the ratio of such increase an additional independent experiment was performed where the tested leaf samples were diluted and the od values were referred to a linear standard curve of known amounts of tuyv virions loaded on the same microplate . the raise in virus accumulation reached a fold increase in the presence of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . a similar stimulating effect of on virus accumulation was observed with bmyv a closely related polerovirus . in contrast to tuyv both _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ constructs induced a moderate increase of bmyv accumulation . in order to assess whether the effect of on local virus accumulation was linked to its ability to bind rt cter tuyv cter was co infiltrated in n. benthamiana leaves with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ or _METHOD_ as a control . as shown in citation c no stimulating effect of _METHOD_ cipk was observed on tuyv cter titer in infiltrated leaves while an increase of tuyv wt accumulation was visible when the fusion protein was present . the results of a second experiment are shown in citation . together these data clearly indicate that rt cter domain is essential to foster s action on virus accumulation in inoculated leaves . when leaves are agroinoculated epidermal and mesophyll cells are mostly targeted but we assume that the stimulatory effect of on tuyv accumulation observed in these cells occurs also in phloem cells . to investigate whether the tuyv titer increase monitored in leaves transiently _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ would affect viral long distance movement and further accumulation in systemic leaves upper non infiltrated leaves of plants co infiltrated with tuyv and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ or tuyv and _METHOD_ constructs were assayed by das elisa three to four weeks post inoculation in two independent experiments . surprisingly the higher accumulation of tuyv observed in leaves co infiltrated with _METHOD_ cipk did not result in elevated virus titer in systemic leaves . a lower level of virus accumulation was even observed in one experiment when _METHOD_ cipk was co _PROTEIN_ with tuyv . these results show that a higher local tuyv titer in infiltrated leaves transiently overexpressing _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ did not lead to an increase in virus accumulation in systemic leaves . in order to examine the subcellular localization of both fusion proteins _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ n. benthamiana leaves were agroinfiltrated with the corresponding constructs and epidermal cells were observed by confocal microscopy h post infiltration . _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was localized in the _LOCATION_ and the cytoplasm . interestingly _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ co localized with the plasmodesmata marker _PROTEIN_ fused to _METHOD_ suggesting that _METHOD_ cipk might be located in or near plasmodesmata . on the other hand the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ construct which had no visible effect on virus accumulation was present in the _LOCATION_ and the cytoplasm and was never observed in plasmodesmata . these observations point to a correlation between the plasmodesmata targeting of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and its biological effect on virus accumulation . since we observed that overexpression of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ affected tuyv accumulation we addressed the issue of a putative feed back effect of tuyv infection on the _PROTEIN_ of mrna . to answer this question accumulation of transcripts was quantified by qrt pcr in a. thaliana plants inoculated with tuyv using viruliferous aphids . myzus persicae were allowed to acquire purified virus particles from an artificial diet before being transferred onto a. thaliana col plants . as a control aphids fed on the artificial diet free of virions were similarly deposited onto test plants . aphids were eliminated by an insecticide treatment four days after loading and rna was extracted from newly developed leaves or days post aphid infestation . the presence of viral rna in systemic leaves of individual plants was first tested by rt pcr before combining the rna samples of infected plants for qrt pcr analysis . while no difference in _PROTEIN_ was observed among infected and non infected plants dpai a moderate reduction of mrna accumulation was detected dpai .
