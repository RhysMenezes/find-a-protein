eukaryotic elongation _PROTEIN_ alpha was identified as an interactor of turnip mosaic virus rna dependent rna polymerase and vpg protease using tandem affinity purification and/or in vitro assays . subcellular fractionation experiments revealed that the level of substantially increased in _LOCATION_ fractions upon tumv infection . replication of tumv occurs in cytoplasmic _LOCATION_ vesicles which are induced by vpg pro . confocal microscopy indicated that was included in these vesicles . to confirm that was found in replication vesicles we constructed an infectious recombinant tumv that contains an additional copy of the protein fused to the green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ . in cells infected with this recombinant tumv _METHOD_ emitted by _METHOD_ was associated with cytoplasmic _LOCATION_ vesicles that contained vpg pro the eukaryotic initiation _PROTEIN_ the poly binding protein the heat shock cognate protein and . these results suggest that tumv induced _LOCATION_ vesicles host at least three plant translation _PROTEIN_ in addition to the viral replication proteins .
the tandem affinity purification tag approach followed by _METHOD_ spectroscopy and/or immunoblotting analyses provide a powerful approach for identifying components of protein complexes . the tap tag is composed of a protein a domain that binds igg agarose a tev protease site for protease mediated cleavage of the fusion protein from the igg agarose and a calmodulin binding protein domain for reversible calcium dependent binding to calmodulin agarose . we took advantage of our existing a. thaliana _PROTEIN_ rdrp and _PROTEIN_ green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ t lines to investigate as a potential cellular interactor of the viral protein . the _PROTEIN_ rdrp line _PROTEIN_ tumv rdrp with a tap tag fused at its n terminal end while the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ line _PROTEIN_ a tap tagged _METHOD_ protein . to investigate the interaction between rdrp and the host protein extracts from week old rdrp _PROTEIN_ a. thaliana plants were incubated with igg coated beads and absorbed proteins were then released by protease cleavage of the protein a moiety . a second affinity purification step was performed by incubating the protease released proteins with calmodulin coated resin in presence of calcium and elution was performed using an egta containing buffer . as a control for the tap procedure extracts from _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were subjected to the same purification strategy as rdrp _PROTEIN_ transgenic plants . the eluted material was separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and analyzed by immunoblotting using anti cbp and anti antibodies . rdrp and _METHOD_ tap fusions were detected at the expected molecular _METHOD_ of and kda respectively following igg agarose and cam agarose chromatography . we then investigated the presence of in the _PROTEIN_ rdrp extract . immunoblotting using a rabbit serum directed against confirmed the co purification of with the viral protein in the _PROTEIN_ rdrp but not in the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ extract . this data suggests an interaction between the tumv rdrp and . the co purification of with tumv rdrp may be the result of a direct interaction between the two proteins or may occur indirectly through a complex formation involving another protein . an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay based binding assay was used to show the direct interaction of with rdrp . recombinant his tagged rdrp and his tagged from a. thaliana were purified from escherichia coli by metal chelating chromatography . elisa plate wells were coated with his tagged and were incubated with increasing concentrations of his tagged rdrp . complex retention was detected using an anti rdrp rabbit serum . shows a saturation binding curve of with rdrp . control experiments showed that no interaction was detected when his tagged was replaced with metal chelating chromatography purified e. coli lysate containing pet which is the vector that was used for _PROTEIN_ . this experiment indicates that the co purification of in _PROTEIN_ rdrp transgenic plants results from a direct protein protein interaction . we have previously shown the redistribution of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ to _LOCATION_ associated fractions during tumv infection . to determine whether could be modulated in a similar way we examined the distribution of the translation _PROTEIN_ among soluble and _LOCATION_ enriched fractions in nicotiana benthamiana a natural host of tumv . three week old n. benthamiana plants were agroinfiltrated with _METHOD_ . this plasmid contains an infectious tumv cdna that contains an additional gene that codes for the protein linked to _METHOD_ . infiltrated leaves were collected four days _PROTEIN_ and used for subcellular fractionation assays . total soluble and _LOCATION_ associated proteins were separated by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and analyzed by immunoblot experiments using an anti rabbit serum . was found _PROTEIN_ in the soluble fraction of control agroinfiltrated plants although a small quantity was observed in the _LOCATION_ enriched fraction . however in tumv agroinfiltrated plants a substantially higher level of was found in the _LOCATION_ enriched fractions when compared to the control plants . to investigate further the _LOCATION_ association of the elongation _PROTEIN_ was fused to the _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ or and _PROTEIN_ transiently in n . benthamiana using agroinfiltration . _PROTEIN_ of the _METHOD_ fusions was assessed by immunoblot analysis using a rabbit serum raised against . in both cases _METHOD_ a signal corresponding to the expected molecular _METHOD_ of the analyzed protein was observed indicating that full length proteins had been _PROTEIN_ . _METHOD_ was visualized to days post infiltration by confocal microscopy . no notable differences in cellular localization were observed during this time period . _METHOD_ was generally observed in to of the cells in the infiltrated area . _METHOD_ and markers with or without _LOCATION_ targeting signals were co _PROTEIN_ with the _METHOD_ proteins to facilitate the cellular localization of the translation _PROTEIN_ . the coexpression of _METHOD_ and clearly showed that the translation _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ a soluble cytoplasmic protein and was excluded from the _LOCATION_ . a similar pattern was observed when was fused to _METHOD_ and coexpressed with dsred . when _LOCATION_ targeted _METHOD_ _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ was coexpressed with the fusion only partial co localization was noted . these results are in agreement with the cellular fractionation data in which was detected mostly in the soluble fraction and that a small proportion of the was _LOCATION_ associated . it is well established that a subset of the rdrp is _LOCATION_ associated and resides within replication vesicles . we have recently demonstrated that the presence of tumv rdrp into cytoplasmic vesicles results from its association with vpg pro . we consequently investigated whether _PROTEIN_ of a non cleavable form of vpg pro can alter the subcellular localization of . we previously showed that _PROTEIN_ of vpg pro ct induced the formation of cytoplasmic vesicles within which rdrp was found . c shows that rdrp and localized within the vesicles induced by vpg pro ct. we also found that could be retargeted to the vesicles induced by vpg pro _METHOD_ in the absence of rdrp . a similar pattern was observed when was fused to _METHOD_ and coexpressed with vpg pro fused to the _METHOD_ protein mcherry . these data suggest that the elongation _PROTEIN_ can be internalized within vpg pro induced vesicles and that a tripartite complex between vpg pro and rdrp is likely . the presence of the translation elongation _PROTEIN_ into the vesicles induced by vpg pro raised the possibility of a direct interaction between the two proteins . to investigate this possibility elisa plate wells were coated with his tagged and were incubated with increasing concentrations of glutathione s transferase _PROTEIN_ tagged vpg pro . complex retention was detected using a polyclonal anti _PROTEIN_ antibody . a shows a saturation binding curve of with vpg pro . control experiments showed the specificity of the in vitro interaction as no signal was detected when _PROTEIN_ tagged vpg pro was replaced with _PROTEIN_ . vpg pro auto catalytically cleaves itself into two functional domains vpg and pro . elisa based binding assays were conducted to test if the interaction with was mediated by either one of the two domains . a shows that each domain was also able to bind . interestingly the optical density value for saturation with vpg or pro was half of that obtained with vpg pro suggesting that vpg pro can bind two molecules of the elongation _PROTEIN_ . the elisa based binding assays indicated that interacts with rdrp and vpg pro . the possibility of a trimolecular complex was thus investigated . elisa plate wells were coated with his tagged and were incubated with increasing amounts of _PROTEIN_ tagged vpg pro in the absence or in the presence of a saturating binding concentration of his tagged rdrp . complex retention was detected using either a polyclonal anti _PROTEIN_ antibody or polyclonal anti rdrp antibody . b shows a saturation binding curve of vpg pro with the . a similar saturation curve was observed with a saturating binding concentration of rdrp to all concentration of vpg pro . the rdrp was retained in the wells in the presence of vpg pro since a constant signal was detected with the anti rdrp . this experiment indicates that both viral proteins bind to in a non competitive manner . this also suggests that a tripartite complex of vpg pro rdrp and exists in tumv infected plants . the retargeting of within the _LOCATION_ vesicles induced by vpg pro was analyzed by ectopic _PROTEIN_ of individual viral proteins . to confirm that the protein is found in viral derived vesicles during tumv infection we constructed the plasmid _METHOD_ . this plasmid contains an infectious tumv cdna that contains an additional copy of the protein fused to _METHOD_ . the _METHOD_ coding sequence was inserted between the and hcpro coding genes as an in frame translational fusion containing flanking and vpg pro cleavage sites . a similar engineered tev vector has previously been shown to be infectious and to induce the formation of _LOCATION_ derived vesicles . the ability of this modified tumv to replicate and form _METHOD_ vesicles was investigated by _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in n. benthamiana by agroinfiltration . _METHOD_ was observed four days _PROTEIN_ in infiltrated leaves and systemic infection became apparent after six days . _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ was assessed by immunoblot analysis using a rabbit serum raised against _METHOD_ . a signal corresponding to the expected molecular _METHOD_ of _METHOD_ was observed in the _LOCATION_ associated fraction . this result suggests that _METHOD_ was _PROTEIN_ and correctly released from the polyprotein by the viral proteinases . when observed by confocal microscopy _METHOD_ emitted by _METHOD_ was associated with cytoplasmic vesicles . on average there were one to three vesicles per cell although several smaller fluorescing structures were also observed . to further characterize these _METHOD_ tagged vesicles the presence of vpg pro within these vesicles was first investigated by co _PROTEIN_ vpg pro mcherry with _METHOD_ . red _METHOD_ emitted by vpg pro mcherry was found in all _METHOD_ tagged vesicles . we have previously shown that the vpg pro derived vesicles house the host _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ eif and _PROTEIN_ . the presence of these _PROTEIN_ in the vesicles induced by _METHOD_ during tumv infection was investigated . each protein was co _PROTEIN_ with _METHOD_ in n . benthamiana . when _PROTEIN_ mcherry was coexpressed with _METHOD_ red _METHOD_ was seen throughout the cytoplasm but was also observed in viral induced vesicles exactly where green _METHOD_ was emitted by _METHOD_ . similarly the red _METHOD_ produced by eif dsred or _PROTEIN_ was observed throughout the cytoplasm but was also found within the green fluorescing vesicles induced by _METHOD_ . these results indicate that the _METHOD_ tagged vesicles observed upon tumv infection were not empty structures but contained proteins previously found to be included in vpg pro induced vesicles . to test whether is also present in the vesicles formed by _METHOD_ was coexpressed with _METHOD_ in n . benthamiana . _METHOD_ was visualized four days postagroinfiltration by confocal microscopy . red _METHOD_ was seen throughout the cytoplasm but also accumulated in punctuate locations that co localized with the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . this experiment indicated that was internalized in the vesicles formed by _METHOD_ during tumv infection . to verify that the presence of _PROTEIN_ eif _PROTEIN_ and within the _METHOD_ induced vesicles was not the result of a non specific entrapment lipase mcherry was coexpressed with _METHOD_ . the lipase mcherry was previously found to localize in the cytoplasm days post infiltration and to localize in the intercellular space days post infiltration . to date there is no data involving the lipase in tumv replication so this protein should not localize in the vesicles . as expected the lipase mcherry was not redistributed in the virus induced vesicles when coexpressed with _METHOD_ . the specificity of the vesicular localization of _PROTEIN_ eef and _PROTEIN_ was further confirmed by the coexpression of tumv mcherry with _METHOD_ . tumv mcherry did not co localize with the green _METHOD_ produced by the _METHOD_ . instead the viral protein was found in the _LOCATION_ of the infected plant cell . _METHOD_ was also used to confirm the presence of the elongation _PROTEIN_ within the vesicles . n. benthamiana plants were agroinfiltrated with _METHOD_ and infiltrated leaves were collected four days _PROTEIN_ for protoplast isolation . protoplasts were then fixed and labeled with rabbit sera raised against vpg pro or . the distribution of the tested proteins was visualized with alexa fluor conjugated secondary antibody . the presence of vpg pro within the vesicles formed by _METHOD_ during the course of tumv infection was first investigated . _METHOD_ associated with vpg pro was coincident with that of the vesicles formed by _METHOD_ . every vesicles formed by _METHOD_ were positive for the presence of vpg pro . additionally presence of _PROTEIN_ and eif in the _METHOD_ derived vesicles was tested using anti _PROTEIN_ and anti eif sera . as expected _PROTEIN_ and eif were found in the _METHOD_ tagged vesicles . likewise red _METHOD_ associated with endogenous was found within the _METHOD_ induced vesicles . a proportion of was also observed in the cytoplasm . these data point to the hypothesis that the vesicles tagged with _METHOD_ house the virus replication complex and that at least three translation _PROTEIN_ are included in these vesicles .
