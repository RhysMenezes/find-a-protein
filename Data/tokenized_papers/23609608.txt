calcium dependent protein kinases are a major group of calcium stimulated kinases found in plants and some protists . many cdpks are _LOCATION_ associated presumably because of lipid modifications at their amino termini . we investigated the subcellular location and myristoylation of _PROTEIN_ a member of the arabidopsis cdpk family . most _PROTEIN_ was associated with the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ as demonstrated by two phase fractionation of plant microsomes and by in vivo detection of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion proteins . _PROTEIN_ was a substrate for plant n myristoyltransferase and myristoylation was prevented by converting the glycine at the proposed site of myristate attachment to alanine _PROTEIN_ . in transgenic plants a _PROTEIN_ mutation completely abolished _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ association indicating that myristoylation was essential for _LOCATION_ binding . the first sixteen amino acids of _PROTEIN_ were sufficient to direct _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ localization . in addition differentially phosphorylated _METHOD_ of _PROTEIN_ were detected both in planta and after _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in a cell free plant extract . our results demonstrate that _PROTEIN_ is myristoylated at its amino terminus and that myristoylation is required for _LOCATION_ binding .
several arabidopsis cdpks are known to be _LOCATION_ bound although _PROTEIN_ has not been studied previously . to determine whether _PROTEIN_ was associated with the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ or with intracellular _LOCATION_ aqueous two phase partitioning was used to fractionate microsomes from wildtype plants . this technique enriches _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ vesicles in the upper phase while other intracellular _LOCATION_ partition to the lower phase . after phase separation both phases were analyzed by immunoblotting to detect _PROTEIN_ protein and protein markers for specific _LOCATION_ . _PROTEIN_ was highly enriched in the upper phase similar to the h _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ marker . as expected intracellular _LOCATION_ marker proteins were enriched in the lower phase . these results indicate that _PROTEIN_ is associated with the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ but does not exclude the possibility that some _PROTEIN_ protein may be located in the _LOCATION_ . is localized to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . _LOCATION_ from wildtype arabidopsis plants were fractionated by aqueous two phase partitioning . equal proportions of the upper and lower phases were separated by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ transferred to pvdf _LOCATION_ and analyzed sequentially using antibodies specific for _PROTEIN_ and for _LOCATION_ marker proteins . u upper phase _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ l lower phase _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ is localized to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . _LOCATION_ from wildtype arabidopsis plants were fractionated by aqueous two phase partitioning . equal proportions of the upper and lower phases were separated by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ transferred to pvdf _LOCATION_ and analyzed sequentially using antibodies specific for _PROTEIN_ and for _LOCATION_ marker proteins . u upper phase _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ l lower phase _LOCATION_ to investigate whether the amino terminus of _PROTEIN_ contains a myristoylation consensus sequence two myristoylation prediction _METHOD_ were queried myristoylator and nmt predictor . myristoylator predicted myristoylation of _PROTEIN_ while nmt predictor did not . to determine whether _PROTEIN_ could be myristoylated in vitro we used a cell free transcription/translation system from wheat germ that is known to contain nmt activity . both wildtype _PROTEIN_ protein and its glycine to alanine _PROTEIN_ mutant were tested . reactions included either methionine for detection of total protein synthesis or myristic acid for detection of myristoylated proteins . for both dna templates the major product of the methionine labeled reaction was a protein doublet near the predicted _METHOD_ of kda . myristate was incorporated into a kda product when the wildtype _PROTEIN_ protein was _PROTEIN_ but not when template dna containing the _PROTEIN_ mutation was used . the identity of these radiolabeled proteins as _PROTEIN_ was confirmed by immunoblot analysis with _PROTEIN_ antibody which recognizes the unique amino terminus of _PROTEIN_ . the kda protein recognized by the _PROTEIN_ antibodies represents non specific binding to a wheat germ protein since it was present in a control reaction that contained no dna template . the smaller non myristoylated proteins routinely observed in methionine labeled reactions may be alternative translation products from the _PROTEIN_ constructs or _PROTEIN_ degradation products . these results indicate that the _PROTEIN_ protein can be myristoylated in vitro and that gly is essential for myristoylation.fig . is myristoylated in vitro and a _PROTEIN_ mutation prevents myristoylation . in a wheat germ coupled transcription and translation system _PROTEIN_ protein was _PROTEIN_ in the presence of either a methionine b myristic acid or c no radiolabel followed by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and fluorography or immunoblotting . parallel experiments were performed on _PROTEIN_ protein containing a glycine to alanine mutation . negative control reactions contained no plasmid template for gene _PROTEIN_ . arrows indicate _PROTEIN_ protein _PROTEIN_ is myristoylated in vitro and a _PROTEIN_ mutation prevents myristoylation . in a wheat germ coupled transcription and translation system _PROTEIN_ protein was _PROTEIN_ in the presence of either a methionine b myristic acid or c no radiolabel followed by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and fluorography or immunoblotting . parallel experiments were performed on _PROTEIN_ protein containing a glycine to alanine mutation . negative control reactions contained no plasmid template for gene _PROTEIN_ . arrows indicate _PROTEIN_ protein we noticed that _PROTEIN_ was often detected as a doublet of approximately and kda whether the protein source was arabidopsis plant extracts or wheat germ _PROTEIN_ extracts . this doublet was observed for both wildtype _PROTEIN_ and the _PROTEIN_ mutant protein indicating that the second band is not due to the effects of myristoylation . phosphorylation can retard the migration of proteins so we examined whether the kda species represented a phosphorylated form of _PROTEIN_ . three different protein samples were tested the upper phase after aqueous two phase partitioning of wildtype plant extracts wheat germ transcription/translation reactions _PROTEIN_ wildtype _PROTEIN_ or wheat germ transcription/translation reactions _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ mutated _PROTEIN_ . protein samples were treated with alkaline phosphatase in the presence or absence of alkaline phosphatase inhibitor . alkaline phosphatase treatment resulted in the disappearance of the kda species and an increase in abundance of the kda species . in the presence of both alkaline phosphatase and alkaline phosphatase inhibitor both the and kda species were detected . slight variations in migration are likely due to differences in buffer composition of the samples . these results indicate that phosphorylated _PROTEIN_ is present in plant extracts that phosphorylation also occurs during in vitro synthesis of _PROTEIN_ in a cell free extract and that myristoylation and _LOCATION_ association are not required for phosphorylation of _PROTEIN_ . is phosphorylated when _PROTEIN_ in planta or in vitro . the upper phase from two phase partitioning of arabidopsis _LOCATION_ cell free wheat germ extract following in vitro _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ or cell free wheat germ extract following _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutant protein were incubated with calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase and alkaline phosphatase inhibitor . the reaction products were separated by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ was detected by immunoblotting with _PROTEIN_ antibody _PROTEIN_ is phosphorylated when _PROTEIN_ in planta or in vitro . the upper phase from two phase partitioning of arabidopsis _LOCATION_ cell free wheat germ extract following in vitro _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ or cell free wheat germ extract following _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutant protein were incubated with calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase and alkaline phosphatase inhibitor . the reaction products were separated by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ was detected by immunoblotting with _PROTEIN_ antibody correct subcellular targeting of acylated proteins from metazoans and yeast often requires only a short region at the amino terminus of the protein . previously we demonstrated that the amino terminus of a different arabidopsis cdpk _PROTEIN_ was sufficient for its correct targeting to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . to determine whether the amino terminal region of _PROTEIN_ was sufficient for its _LOCATION_ targeting transgenic plants were produced that _PROTEIN_ the first amino acids of _PROTEIN_ fused to the _PROTEIN_ reporter protein _PROTEIN_ under control of the native _PROTEIN_ promoter . for comparison plants were transformed with the t dna from in which the gus protein is _PROTEIN_ from the promoter . to determine the relative distribution of gus protein between _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ plant extracts were centrifuged to separate microsomes from soluble proteins as described previously and gus activity in these two fractions was measured with a sensitive fluorometric assay . as expected in control plants transformed with t dna from the majority of the gus protein was soluble and only a small amount was _LOCATION_ associated probably due to non specific _LOCATION_ binding or trapping of the abundant gus protein in _LOCATION_ vesicles during preparation of extracts . in _PROTEIN_ gus plant extracts the majority of the gus enzyme activity was in the microsomal fraction indicating that most of the _PROTEIN_ gus fusion protein was _LOCATION_ associated and that the first amino acids of _PROTEIN_ are sufficient for _LOCATION_ targeting . to determine whether the _PROTEIN_ gus fusion protein was targeted to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ similar to wildtype _PROTEIN_ the microsomal fraction was used for aqueous two phase partitioning . both native _PROTEIN_ protein and the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ marker were enriched in the upper phase while the markers for organellar _LOCATION_ were concentrated in the lower phase confirming that the cellular _LOCATION_ partitioned correctly . the location of the hybrid _PROTEIN_ gus fusion protein was determined with a fluorometric assay for gus activity . the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ enriched upper phase contained more gus activity per milliliter than the lower phase . when _PROTEIN_ as specific activity to correct for the six fold greater protein content in the lower phase the difference between the amount of _PROTEIN_ gus fusion protein in the two phases is apparent . these results indicate that the first amino acids of _PROTEIN_ are sufficient to correctly target the soluble gus protein to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . first sixteen amino acids of _PROTEIN_ are sufficient for _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ localization . microsomal _LOCATION_ from _PROTEIN_ gus transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were analyzed by aqueous two phase partitioning . equal proportions of the upper and lower phases were separated by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and assayed by immunoblotting with specific antibodies . chlorophyll absorbance was measured spectrophotometrically . the gus enzyme was assayed fluorometrically and is _PROTEIN_ as activity and as specific activity . u upper phase l lower phase the first sixteen amino acids of _PROTEIN_ are sufficient for _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ localization . microsomal _LOCATION_ from _PROTEIN_ gus transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were analyzed by aqueous two phase partitioning . equal proportions of the upper and lower phases were separated by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and assayed by immunoblotting with specific antibodies . chlorophyll absorbance was measured spectrophotometrically . the gus enzyme was assayed fluorometrically and is _PROTEIN_ as activity and as specific activity . u upper phase l lower phase to address the importance of _PROTEIN_ myristoylation in _LOCATION_ binding in plants we examined the effect of mutation of the myristoylation site on _LOCATION_ association . site directed mutagenesis was used to convert the second codon of gus from glycine to alanine _PROTEIN_ to create _PROTEIN_ gus . extracts from transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ gus fusion protein were separated into soluble and microsomal fractions by ultracentrifugation . gus enzyme activity was measured in both fractions using the fluorometric assay . the majority of the gus activity was detected in the soluble fraction compared with when plants _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ gus transgene without the _PROTEIN_ mutation . these results demonstrate that myristoylation is critical for the _LOCATION_ binding of _PROTEIN_ in vivo . to confirm the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ localization of _PROTEIN_ a construct containing the first amino acids of _PROTEIN_ fused to green _METHOD_ protein was used for transient _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis . _METHOD_ was bombarded into arabidopsis leaves and _PROTEIN_ in epidermal cells was examined by confocal microscopy . the quantitative gus assay data presented earlier indicated that of _PROTEIN_ was _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ associated and it is evident from a single optical section near the midpoint of the cell that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was found at the cell periphery corresponding to _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ localized _PROTEIN_ . a maximum intensity projection indicates that _METHOD_ was also observed in the _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ likely corresponding to soluble _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein . _METHOD_ in _LOCATION_ was observed routinely for all transgenic plants and was not unexpected since the sizes of free _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ are below the exclusion limit of the _LOCATION_ pore complex . in cells _PROTEIN_ the non myristoylated _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein _METHOD_ was localized primarily in the _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ in a pattern similar to free _METHOD_ . these data confirm that a substantial proportion of _PROTEIN_ is localized to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and that the amino terminal glycine residue is required for _LOCATION_ binding.fig . _LOCATION_ localization of _PROTEIN_ requires glycine . arabidopsis epidermal cells transiently _PROTEIN_ various _METHOD_ constructs were observed by confocal microscopy . a and b _METHOD_ control c and d _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ e and f
