mutation of the immunophilin like _PROTEIN_ binding protein twisted _PROTEIN_ causes dwarf and twisted organ phenotypes in arabidopsis . however the function of _PROTEIN_ is not fully understood at the molecular level . using genetic physiological and immunological experiments we show here that _PROTEIN_ is necessary for brassinosteroid signal transduction . the _PROTEIN_ mutant showed reduced br sensitivity in growth responses and activation of the _PROTEIN_ transcription _PROTEIN_ . however _PROTEIN_ showed normal responses to an inhibitor of _PROTEIN_ suggesting that _PROTEIN_ has a defect upstream of _PROTEIN_ in the br signaling pathway . in vitro and in vivo assays showed that _PROTEIN_ interacts physically with the kinase domains of the br receptor kinases _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ is not required for normal localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ or for activation of the flagellin receptor kinase _PROTEIN_ . our results suggest that _PROTEIN_ plays a specific role in the activation of _PROTEIN_ receptor kinase .
it has been reported that the _PROTEIN_ mutants _PROTEIN_ showed reduced responses to epibrassinolide inhibition of root growth and _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . consistent with the previous study we found that the _PROTEIN_ mutant was less sensitive than wild type plants to brassinolide in root growth and hypocotyl elongation . furthermore high concentrations of bl did not promote hypocotyl elongation in _PROTEIN_ seedlings in contrast to wild type col . these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ is required for normal br signal transduction . to determine genetic interaction between _PROTEIN_ and the br signaling pathway we crossed _PROTEIN_ with transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ the gain of function _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in which the mutation leads to a constitutively active hypophosphorylated form of _PROTEIN_ due to increased affinity to _PROTEIN_ phosphatases . phenotypic analyses of week old _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ comparing with _PROTEIN_ showed that the _PROTEIN_ mutation partially suppressed the dwarf phenotype of _PROTEIN_ which is similar to _PROTEIN_ suppression of _PROTEIN_ . the results suggest that _PROTEIN_ is involved in br signaling upstream of _PROTEIN_ . to determine if _PROTEIN_ regulates _PROTEIN_ activities by regulating _PROTEIN_ we treated seedlings with bikinin an inhibitor of kinases compared with bl and mock treatments . we determined _PROTEIN_ phosphorylation status by western blotting using transgenic lines _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in col and _PROTEIN_ . western blot results demonstrated that without bl treatment _PROTEIN_ accumulated a higher level of inactive phosphorylated _METHOD_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein than wild type . furthermore treatment of nm bl for min only partially dephosphorylated _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in _PROTEIN_ whereas the same treatment almost fully dephosphorylated _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in wild type . the reduced responsiveness to br in _METHOD_ of _PROTEIN_ dephosphorylation in _PROTEIN_ is consistent with the reduced br responses observed in root growth inhibition and hypocotyl elongation . however unlike br treatment treatment with bikinin an inhibitor of _PROTEIN_ kinase induced similar dephosphorylation of _PROTEIN_ in wild type and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . bikinin also induced similar growth responses in wild type and _PROTEIN_ . thus the results suggest that _PROTEIN_ is likely involved in the br signaling pathway upstream of _PROTEIN_ . next we tested whether br signaling components upstream of _PROTEIN_ such as _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and bsks interact with _PROTEIN_ . first protein protein interactions were tested in vitro by gel blot overlay assays . the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ tagged kinase domains of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ tagged _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were gel blotted and probed with mbp tagged _PROTEIN_ protein . the results further indicated that _PROTEIN_ interacts with the kinase domains of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ but not _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ . this interaction was further confirmed in vivo by bimolecular _METHOD_ complementation assays . tobacco epidermal cells co transformed with the amino terminal half of yellow _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ fused to the amino terminus of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ fused to the _PROTEIN_ terminal half of cyan _METHOD_ protein _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ showed strong _METHOD_ signals similar to the signals of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ which served as a positive control . the bifc signal of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was co localized with the _METHOD_ signal of _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ intrinsic protein _PROTEIN_ aquaporin _PROTEIN_ which has been shown to be localized at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and endosomal _LOCATION_ mediated through endocytosis . treatment of the leaf tissues with bl or propiconazole _PROTEIN_ which blocks br biosynthesis did not obviously alter the interaction between _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ suggesting that _PROTEIN_ interacts with _PROTEIN_ in a br independent manner . tobacco leaves co transformed with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ showed no _METHOD_ signal . thus the results suggest that _PROTEIN_ affects br signaling by binding to the kinase domains of the receptors _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . a previous study has demonstrated that _PROTEIN_ is required for localization of _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ protein abcb auxin transporters and mutations in _PROTEIN_ lead to mislocalization of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ to the _LOCATION_ instead of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . to test whether _PROTEIN_ is also necessary for localization of the _PROTEIN_ receptor to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ we crossed transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ with the _PROTEIN_ mutant . confocal microscopic analysis demonstrated that the root tips of col wild type and _PROTEIN_ exhibited similar _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ intensities . we detected _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signals at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and in the endocytic vesicles which were labeled with propidium iodide _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ consistent with the results reported in a previous study . our results showed that subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was not affected in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . quantification of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ intensities further supported that the _PROTEIN_ mutation did not significantly alter _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ levels . thus unlike the abcb proteins _PROTEIN_ localization to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ does not require _PROTEIN_ . our results suggest that _PROTEIN_ functions in the br signaling pathway by means of protein protein interaction with the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ receptor kinases . to determine whether _PROTEIN_ plays a specific role in br signaling or also modulates other receptor kinase pathways we tested the effect of _PROTEIN_ mutation on flagellin responses which is mediated by the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ receptor kinases . treatments with flagellin for days reduced growth in _PROTEIN_ more than wild type . time course analysis of induced map kinase activation by western blotting indicated that _PROTEIN_ responded to more strongly than wild type plants after and min of treatment . quantitative rt pcr analysis of _PROTEIN_ of flagellin induced genes _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ showed that _PROTEIN_ was slightly more responsive than wild type to treatment . these observations of enhanced responses in _PROTEIN_ suggest that _PROTEIN_ is not required for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ functions in mediating immunity signaling and that _PROTEIN_ might negatively regulate responses either directly through interaction with _PROTEIN_ or indirectly through reduced br signaling which is known to antagonize flagellin responses .
