the _PROTEIN_ protein complex is a heterotetramer involved in clathrin mediated endocytosis of cargo proteins from the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ in animal cells . the homologous genes of ap subunits are present in the genomes of plants however their identities and roles in endocytic pathways are not clearly defined in plants . here we reveal the molecular composition of the ap complex of arabidopsis thaliana and its dynamics on the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . we identified all of the and subunits of the ap complex and detected a weak interaction of the ap complex with clathrin heavy chain . the subunit protein fused to green _METHOD_ protein _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was localized to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and to the cytoplasm . live cell imaging using a variable angle _METHOD_ microscope revealed that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transiently _METHOD_ punctate structures on the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . homozygous _PROTEIN_ mutant plants exhibited abnormal floral structures including reduced stamen elongation and delayed anther dehiscence which led to a failure of pollination and a subsequent reduction of fertility . our study provides a molecular basis for understanding ap dependent endocytic pathways in plants and their roles in floral organ development and plant reproduction .
the arabidopsis genome contains ap subunit homologs two genes for each of the large subunits and single genes for the medium subunit and the small subunit . to be consistent with the nomenclature for ap complexes of other _METHOD_ the following nomenclature is used for the arabidopsis genes _PROTEIN_ protein _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ for subunits _PROTEIN_ protein beta _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ for subunits _PROTEIN_ protein mu _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ for the subunit and _PROTEIN_ protein sigma _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ for the subunit . _PROTEIN_ was formerly denoted as . to reveal the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ transformant plants _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ protein fused to green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ under the control of the endogenous promoter in the _PROTEIN_ mutant background were generated . in these transformant plants the _PROTEIN_ mutant phenotype was complemented suggesting that the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein is functional and behaves similarly to its endogenous counterpart . confocal laser scanning microscopy revealed that in the root tip cells of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ plants the _METHOD_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ colocalized with a _METHOD_ lipophilic dye that labels the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and was dispersed throughout the _LOCATION_ . colocalization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ with was also observed in the cotyledon epidermal cells of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ plants . subcellular fractionation of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ seedlings revealed that a major part of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein was found in the soluble fraction which accumulated the _LOCATION_ cys protease aleurain _PROTEIN_ whereas a minor part of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein was detected in the microsome fraction which accumulated the _LOCATION_ snare protein _PROTEIN_ . these results suggest that the _PROTEIN_ protein is predominantly accumulated in the _LOCATION_ and is also localized to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . in mammalian cells the ap complex is recruited to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ to interact with cargo proteins during ccv formation . to examine whether the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ is dependent on the interaction with cargo proteins the root tip cells of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ seedlings were incubated with the clathrin mediated endocytosis inhibitor . tyrphostin which has no effect on the interaction between ap and cargo proteins was used as the negative control . significantly reduced the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ in a time dependent manner although the _METHOD_ at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ was not altered by even after the h incubation . quantitative analysis demonstrated that the ratio of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ to the _LOCATION_ was significantly reduced by the treatment compared with the mock and treatments . these results indicate that the treatment selectively disrupts _PROTEIN_ localization to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ through interrupting the interaction with cargo proteins . variable angle _METHOD_ microscopy is a powerful tool to visualize the dynamics of ccv components including clathrin light chain and dynamin related proteins on the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . to reveal the structure and dynamics of _PROTEIN_ on the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ root cells of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ plants were analyzed by vaem . by the perpendicular incidence of the laser to the root cell surface the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ from the _LOCATION_ was _PROTEIN_ observed _METHOD_ . when the incidence angle was changed within the highly oblique yet subcritical angle range against the cell surface the punctate structures of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ became illuminated . these punctate structures were eliminated after treatment with but not with suggesting that the structures are ccv containing the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein on the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . the punctate structures of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ appeared on the surface of cotyledon epidermal cells at a density of structures per during s . time lapse imaging demonstrated that the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ structures appeared on the cell surface in a transient manner . their _METHOD_ intensities gradually increased and then rapidly _PROTEIN_ . quantitative analysis of the _METHOD_ intensity revealed that the average lifetime of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ structures was s and of the structures disappeared from the cell surface within min . these observations suggest that _PROTEIN_ transiently _METHOD_ the punctate structures of ccv on the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . the arabidopsis genome contains two homologous genes for each of the and subunits . this suggests that multiple sets of the different gene products are used to assemble the arabidopsis ap complex . however its molecular composition has not been revealed experimentally . to identify which gene products are present in the ap complex anti _METHOD_ antibody was used to immunoprecipitate detergent soluble proteins from _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ plants . transgenic arabidopsis plants _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were used as a control . the immunoprecipitated proteins were separated by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and visualized by _METHOD_ staining . this revealed the isolation of proteins specifically bound to _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ which were not present in the control . _METHOD_ spectrometric analysis of the immunoprecipitated proteins repeatedly identified _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . this suggests that all of the subunits encoded in the arabidopsis genome are _PROTEIN_ and physically associated with each other to form the ap complex in planta . simultaneous detection of the two and two subunits suggests that multiple molecular species of the ap complex composed of different and homologous subunits are present in arabidopsis . in mammalian cells the ap complex interacts with clathrin to form ccv . the clathrin heavy chain was detected in the first _METHOD_ spectrometric analysis of the immunoprecipitated proteins from the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ plants . notably the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein was efficiently coimmunoprecipitated with chc in the absence of salt whereas it was not in the presence of mm nacl . these results suggest that the ap complex is weakly associated with chc as a component of ccv . to investigate the roles of ap in plant growth and development homozygous _PROTEIN_ mutant plants were used for further molecular analysis and morphological dissection . sequence analysis demonstrated that the _PROTEIN_ mutant plants harbor a t dna insertion in the seventh exon of the _PROTEIN_ gene . rt pcr analysis revealed that homozygous _PROTEIN_ mutant plants accumulated the half region of the _PROTEIN_ transcripts but neither the full length nor the transcripts . this implies that the _PROTEIN_ mutant plants might accumulate a truncated from of the _PROTEIN_ protein lacking the c terminal region . the _PROTEIN_ mutant plants exhibited smaller and slender rosette leaves with shorter petioles during vegetative growth compared with wild type plants . after bolting the _PROTEIN_ mutant plants exhibited unfertilized pistils and subsequently produced significantly reduced number of seeds compared with the wild type indicating that fertility of the _PROTEIN_ mutant plants was severely reduced . these mutant phenotypes were complemented in the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ plants . these results suggest an involvement of _PROTEIN_ in leaf morphogenesis and the reproductive process . to gain further insight into the role of _PROTEIN_ in fertility the floral structures of the _PROTEIN_ mutant plants were further examined . compared with the wild type the _PROTEIN_ mutant inflorescences contained morphologically abnormal flowers . in fully opened wild type flowers the stamens were positioned close to the pistils with enough length to reach the stigma . these organs were tightly surrounded with _PROTEIN_ and sepals . this arrangement of the floral organs leads to efficient pollination . the _PROTEIN_ mutant flowers exhibited shorter stamens and incompletely opened _PROTEIN_ compared with the wild type . dissection of the flowers revealed that the _PROTEIN_ mutant floral organs exhibited normal numbers and morphology comparable to that of the wild type although their stamens and _PROTEIN_ were slightly smaller than those of the wild type . these defects created the pistil protruding appearance of the mutant flowers . the mutant flowers also exhibited a looser overall structure in which the stamens were positioned away from the pistils . in addition the _PROTEIN_ mutant inflorescences contained flowers with undehisced anthers and flowers with dehisced anthers suggesting that anther dehiscence was delayed in the mutant plants . these defects led to the nonpollinated stigmas observed in most of the mutant flowers . these multiple defects in the floral structures and reproductive functions of the _PROTEIN_ mutant plants were complemented by _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgene . to exclude the possibility that the reduced fertility of the _PROTEIN_ mutant flowers is due to impaired pollen development the viability and structure of pollen grains were investigated . fluorescein diacetate staining indicated that mature _PROTEIN_ pollen exhibited essentially the same viability as that of the wild type under the plant growth conditions of and relative humidity . transmission electron microscopy revealed that the ultrastructure of mature wild type pollen grains was indistinguishable from that of the _PROTEIN_ mutant . these observations suggest that the _PROTEIN_ mutation does not strongly affect pollen development . taken together these observations suggest that _PROTEIN_ plays a vital role in floral organ development which is essential for successful fertilization .
