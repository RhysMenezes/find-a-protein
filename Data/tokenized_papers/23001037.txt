g protein coupled receptor type g proteins _PROTEIN_ are highly conserved _LOCATION_ proteins in plants animals and fungi that have eight to nine predicted transmembrane domains . they have been classified as g protein coupled receptor type g proteins that function as abscisic acid receptors in arabidopsis thaliana . we cloned arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and isolated new t dna insertion alleles of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in both wassilewskija and columbia backgrounds . these _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutants show defects in fertility hypocotyl and root growth and responses to light and sugars . histological studies of shoot tissue reveal cellular distortions that are particularly evident in the epidermal layer . stable _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ in arabidopsis and transient _PROTEIN_ in tobacco indicate that _PROTEIN_ is localized primarily to _LOCATION_ bodies and to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . microarray analysis comparing gene _PROTEIN_ profiles in the wild type and double mutant revealed differences in _PROTEIN_ of genes important for cell wall function hormone response and amino acid metabolism . the double mutants isolated here respond normally to aba in seed germination assays root growth inhibition and gene _PROTEIN_ analysis . these results are inconsistent with their proposed role as aba receptors but demonstrate that _PROTEIN_ are fundamentally important for plant growth and development .
_PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ cdna and genomic sequences were independently cloned from arabidopsis columbia . cdna sequences are identical to those predicted in the arabidopsis information resource . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are and amino acid proteins respectively with a predicted molecular _METHOD_ of kd . they are identical at the amino acid level and are part of a conserved family of proteins found in plants animals and fungi . from phylogenetic analysis the plant animal and fungal _PROTEIN_ proteins group separately according to their kingdom plantae fungi and animalia . several sequences from _METHOD_ that are classified into different _METHOD_ are somewhat distinct from these and each other . these include _PROTEIN_ from dictyostelium discoideum monosiga brevicollis trypanosoma cruzi phytophthora infestans toxoplasma gondii tetrahymena thermophila and paramecium tetraurelia . the algal _PROTEIN_ separate from those of the land plants . alignment of the predicted protein sequences of arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ with those of different plant and animal _PROTEIN_ is shown in figure . the plant sequences show a high level of conservation and share regions of similarity with animal _PROTEIN_ throughout the protein . overall _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are and identical respectively at the amino acid level to _METHOD_ gphr which has recently been proposed as an anion channel critical for _LOCATION_ acidification and function . there is less conservation with fungal sequences from neurospora crassa and saccharomyces cerevisiae but again regions of similarity are seen throughout the proteins . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are predicted to consist of eight to transmembrane domains with a large cytoplasmic domain between the and _LOCATION_ spanning helices . overlapping the _LOCATION_ domain is a highly conserved region spanning amino acids with a single completely conserved g residue that may be functionally important . proteins with this conserved region are annotated as members of the _PROTEIN_ family which has only been identified in eukaryotes and contains the conserved amino acid motif lsg . additionally citation reported the presence of a ras _PROTEIN_ activating protein domain and an _PROTEIN_ binding region signature . these are annotated in figure but it should be noted that the nucleotide binding site overlaps a predicted transmembrane domain and may therefore not be solvent exposed . the nucleotide coding sequences of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are over conserved _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ consist of exons that are the same size except for exon four of _PROTEIN_ which has an additional three nucleotides . these exons are separated by intron/exon splice points that are conserved between the two genes . these data suggest the two genes are probably the result of a relatively recent gene duplication event that is likely to have occurred after the divergence of arabidopsis from other plants and may explain why arabidopsis has two functional genes unlike most other plants which have one . we isolated salk and _PROTEIN_ t dna insertion mutants in col and wassilewskija backgrounds respectively for both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . these have been designated _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and are new mutant alleles compared with those previously isolated . using these single mutants we generated the double mutants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ hereafter referred to as col _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and ws _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ respectively . wild type and mutant alleles were genotyped by pcr using gene specific diagnostic primers flanking the insertion site . the positions of the t dna inserts are shown in figure and were confirmed by sequencing . pcr using wild type genomic dna as a template generated products of the correct size for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ but no equivalent products were observed for the mutants . rt pcr _PROTEIN_ analysis with gene specific primers resulted in full length kb products for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ from wild type samples but no full length product could be amplified from _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ homozygous mutant samples indicating that these are null mutants . however for _PROTEIN_ and the col _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutants rt pcr using _PROTEIN_ specific primers produced two faint products slightly < kb . sequencing showed these to have resulted from t dna excision . in the case of the smaller bp product a region bases from the end of the intron through to the start of the exon of _PROTEIN_ has been spliced out whereas the larger bp product results from the loss of nucleotides that span the t dna insertion in the exon . if translated the and bp cdnas would generate truncated proteins of and amino acids respectively . although the loop domain remains intact in the two possible proteins both lack the last two predicted _LOCATION_ domains and therefore may not be functional . when grown on standard agar plates the single mutants appeared similar to the wild type however the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutants showed an altered morphology . the hypocotyls were slightly _PROTEIN_ and large distended cells were often seen at the hypocotyl surface . this phenotype was exacerbated in the presence of suc . in transverse sections of the hypocotyl there was a severe disruption of cellular shape in the double mutants and irregularly shaped cells were particularly evident in the epidermal layer . a disrupted epidermal layer was also seen in cotyledon sections from the double mutants . to investigate the response to light the insertional mutants were grown in the dark and under low white light in the absence and presence of suc . the mutants showed no significant difference in hypocotyl length from the wild type when grown in the dark but under low white light the double mutants were shorter than their corresponding wild type significantly in the case of the col _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . when suc was included in the medium the double mutants in both backgrounds were significantly shorter than the wild type under low white light . in addition to a short hypocotyl phenotype _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutants were generally smaller than wild type seedlings with reduced shoot and root _METHOD_ and a shorter primary root length . suc restored this defect and in its presence growth of the double mutant was similar to or exceeded that of the wild type . this is not simply an osmotic effect as mannitol had little effect on the growth of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutants . time course measurements showed that in the absence of suc the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutants germinated at the same time as the wild type and root growth was similar until day five when growth rate was reduced in the mutant compared with wild type . in the presence of suc no marked difference in root growth rate was observed in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutants compared with the wild type mm suc could partially rescue the _METHOD_ defect on half strength murashige and skoog _METHOD_ and fully rescue the root length defect and even mm suc could rescue the root length defect . to confirm that these phenotypes resulted from the loss of _PROTEIN_ proteins we transformed the ws _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutant with either _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ . three independent homozygous lines were characterized for each gene . _PROTEIN_ analysis by rt pcr showed that these lines all _PROTEIN_ the relevant gene . in all cases both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ fully rescued the short hypocotyl and root phenotypes of ws _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutant seedlings . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were recently reported to be _PROTEIN_ proteins functioning in arabidopsis as aba receptors . in that study the double mutant _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ showed hyposensitivity to aba . therefore we tested several characteristic aba responses in the mutant alleles we isolated . both the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutants showed a similar inhibition of root extension by aba compared with their respective wild types . there was also no significant difference in the response to aba for seed germination in double mutants compared with the wild type . finally we tested the _PROTEIN_ of the aba induced genes responsive to _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and dre binding _PROTEIN_ by real time rt pcr using d old seedlings treated for h with aba or a mock ethanol treatment . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ both showed significant induction by aba in wild type seedlings but in contrast with the previous study no loss of induction was seen in either _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutants with _PROTEIN_ showing a stronger induction by aba in the mutants . when generating the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutants we observed a distortion in the segregation ratios . crossing of the single _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants resulted in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double heterozygotes which were self fertilized to generate the double homozygous mutant . however the resulting progeny did not segregate according to the expected mendelian segregation ratio of in double mutants with no double mutants observed either in the col or ws backgrounds . this was confirmed by pcr genotyping of the progeny of ws _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double heterozygous plants . to increase the chances of isolating a double homozygous _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutant progeny from _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ parental plants were planted . although an average of double mutants from a total of seeds would be expected we only identified three double homozygous plants from the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ parental line a result that was significantly different from predicted . similar results were obtained for the col _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutant with one double homozygous plant obtained out of progeny tested . to test whether the distorted segregation ratios could be due to possible defects in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant pollen a series of in vitro and in vivo pollen germination and pollen tube growth assays were performed . in the in vitro assay where pollen was allowed to germinate on agarose the double mutants in both backgrounds showed reduced pollen germination and pollen tube extension growth . when self fertilizing stigma were observed pollen tube growth was less evident in the double mutants than the wild type . the majority of double mutant pollen tubes penetrated no further than half way along the pistil whereas the pollen tubes penetrated the entire length of the wild type stigma . a semi in vivo assay in which wild type and double mutant pollen grains were allowed to germinate and grow through a wild type stigma showed that wild type pollen tubes extended the length of the stigma while mutant pollen tubes showed less growth over the time period examined . this was particularly evident for the col background . no obvious defects were observed in the overall flower structure and anther growth appeared similar in double mutants and their respective wild types . when the wild type gtg single and gtg double mutants were grown on soil under standard conditions there was a reduced silique length in the double mutants and this was most marked in the col _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutant . seed number per silique was also severely reduced in the double mutants with a greater proportion of undeveloped or aborted ovules per silique and again this was most pronounced in the col _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutant . this led to an overall reduction in seed yield per plant . although seed number was reduced double mutant seed was considerably larger than the wild type . we tested whether the silique length could be rescued by fertilizing col _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutants with wild type pollen . col _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutant plants fertilized with their own pollen had short siliques whereas when fertilized with wild type pollen silique length was significantly increased but not to wild type length . when col _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ pollen was used to fertilize wild type plants the siliques remained short . the _PROTEIN_ patterns of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were determined using arabidopsis plants _PROTEIN_ either _PROTEIN_ gus _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ gus fusions . as both construct types showed very similar _PROTEIN_ patterns the data are shown only for the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ gus _PROTEIN_ lines . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are _PROTEIN_ throughout the plant with a similar pattern . both genes are _PROTEIN_ in the cotyledons hypocotyl and root with very strong _PROTEIN_ observed in the root tip . high _PROTEIN_ was observed in the vascular system in the root hypocotyl and cotyledon . in mature plants _PROTEIN_ occurred throughout but was again particularly strong in the vascular system of mature leaves as well as the hydathodes . the flowers showed _PROTEIN_ throughout with the highest _PROTEIN_ levels at the base of the carpel as well as in the stigma stamen and pollen . transient _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in arabidopsis protoplasts showed localization close to the periphery of the cells as had been reported previously . however we also frequently observed _METHOD_ within the interior of the protoplast . to analyze localization further we generated arabidopsis lines transformed with the genomic construct of _PROTEIN_ carrying a c terminal _METHOD_ tag _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . overall tissue specific _PROTEIN_ in the seedling was similar to that seen using the gus tagged constructs with a high level in the root tip region and also in the tip of developing _PROTEIN_ roots . closer examination of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ localization within roots showed _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ predominantly within _LOCATION_ bodies of nonelongated cells within the cell division zone of the root tip . as cells began to elongate _LOCATION_ localization was not so apparent and in fully elongated root cells there was a more diffuse pattern . time lapse studies confirmed that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was localized to _LOCATION_ bodies because of their dynamic characteristics . to confirm endomembrane localization _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was transiently _PROTEIN_ in tobacco leaf cells . _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was located in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ bodies and _LOCATION_ body localization was confirmed by coexpression with the _LOCATION_ marker sialyl transferase using _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . to provide a better understanding of the impact of the loss of _PROTEIN_ proteins and therefore their role in the cell we performed a microarray analysis on d old white light grown seedlings using the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ genome array through the nottingham arabidopsis stock centre transcriptomics facility . the _PROTEIN_ of genes showed significantly altered _PROTEIN_ in the col _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant compared with the wild type . increased _PROTEIN_ was observed for genes while had reduced _PROTEIN_ in the double mutant . the full list of genes showing twofold regulation together with p values is given in supplemental data set online . mapman software was used to examine the functional groups to which these genes belong . of the genes belonged to functional groups . for a limited number of these functional groups genes changing in the mutant were enriched compared with the expected number of genes for which we detected _PROTEIN_ at the seedling stage . these groups are shown in figure and the individual genes with functional groups are given in supplemental data set online . the genes in these groups are important in cell wall formation and modification resource recycling including lipid and amino acid metabolism and transport of amino acids peptides and sugars and genes characterized as hormone regulated . in the latter category there were genes seven of which are auxin regulated with five showing reduced _PROTEIN_ in the double mutant . in addition four genes auxin response _PROTEIN_ auxin auxin and short _PROTEIN_ /indole acetic acid inducible _PROTEIN_ that although not designated in this category are considered to be important in auxin responses also showed altered _PROTEIN_ in col _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . interestingly mapman identified only one gene in the hormone functional group that may be involved in aba regulation _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ a _PROTEIN_ transcription _PROTEIN_ shown to bind to and activate the _PROTEIN_ promoter in an _PROTEIN_ dependent manner . this gene was downregulated in the col _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant . the reliability of the microarray data was analyzed by selecting genes for further analysis using real time pcr . a variety of genes was selected that showed a range of _PROTEIN_ changes in col _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ compared with the wild type in the microarray analysis . as shown in figure the real time pcr results were generally consistent with those obtained from the microarray experiments . _PROTEIN_ was confirmed as being downregulated and strong inhibition was also seen for jacalin related _PROTEIN_ one member of a family of genes important in recognition of cell surface _PROTEIN_ and the mobilization and recycling of _PROTEIN_ . other downregulated genes included protodermal _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ a homeobox gene important in shoot epidermal cell differentiation . upregulated genes included the peptide transporter peptide transporter _PROTEIN_ genes involved in amino acid and _PROTEIN_ metabolism saccharopine dehydrogenase _PROTEIN_ and glyoxalase i family xyloglucan _PROTEIN_ a xyloglucan endotransglycosylase likely to be involved in cell wall synthesis and wrky dna binding _PROTEIN_ a jasmonate and salicylic acid regulated transcription _PROTEIN_ involved in plant defense responses . given the relative prevalence of auxin responsive genes identified in the microarray analysis we investigated the effect of mutations in _PROTEIN_ on auxin distribution and responses . to test whether auxin distribution was altered in the mutants the col _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutant and wild type were transformed with the auxin reporter construct _PROTEIN_ gus . however no marked difference in the distribution of staining was observed in the root suggesting that auxin distribution is unaffected in col _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . next we examined hypocotyl and root growth in wild type and mutant seedlings treated with indole acetic acid . for roots this was done in the absence of suc a condition in which the mutants are shorter than the wild type . as reported previously hypocotyl extension and primary root extension are both inhibited by iaa in wild type seedlings . in both col and ws backgrounds the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutants also showed inhibition of hypocotyl and root elongation in response to iaa indicating that the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutants can still respond to auxin .
