chloroplast division is performed by the constriction of envelope _LOCATION_ at the division site . although constriction of a _PROTEIN_ like protein complex has been shown to be involved in chloroplast division it remains unknown how _LOCATION_ lipids participate in the process . here we show that phosphoinositides with unknown function in envelope _LOCATION_ are involved in the regulation of chloroplast division in arabidopsis thaliana . _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ proteins interacted specifically with phosphatidylinositol phosphate _PROTEIN_ . inhibition of phosphatidylinositol kinase _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ the level of _PROTEIN_ in chloroplasts and accelerated chloroplast division . knockout of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or downregulation of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ resulted in _PROTEIN_ levels of _PROTEIN_ in chloroplasts and increased chloroplast numbers . _PROTEIN_ is the _PROTEIN_ contributor to _PROTEIN_ synthesis in chloroplasts and the effect of _PROTEIN_ inhibition was largely abolished in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . overexpression of dynamin related _PROTEIN_ another component of the chloroplast division machinery which is recruited to chloroplasts by _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ enhanced the effect of _PROTEIN_ inhibition whereas overexpression of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ had additive effects . the amount of _PROTEIN_ that associated with chloroplasts increased upon _PROTEIN_ inhibition . these findings suggest that _PROTEIN_ is a regulator of chloroplast division in a _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ dependent manner .
_PROTEIN_ belongs to the dynamin protein superfamily and has a pleckstrin homology domain . the ph domains of dynamins which often bind specific lipids such as _PROTEIN_ or protein ligands regulate the _PROTEIN_ activity of their own _PROTEIN_ domains . the ph domain of _PROTEIN_ was reported to interact with _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ but whether _PROTEIN_ binds to lipids is unknown . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are integral outer envelope proteins so they may exhibit specific interactions with lipids . to examine whether _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ bind specifically to different lipids we performed lipid protein interaction assays . commercial _LOCATION_ spotted with different phospholipids and a _LOCATION_ spotted with chloroplast lipids were used . _PROTEIN_ bound to _PROTEIN_ phosphatidylinositol phosphate and phosphatidic acid _PROTEIN_ whereas _PROTEIN_ bound to _PROTEIN_ with high affinity . weak signals were detected between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ phosphatidylinositol phosphate _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ phosphatidylserine and cardiolipin . _PROTEIN_ bound to ps and cl . none of the proteins bound to chloroplast lipids such as monogalactosyldiacylglycerol digalactosyldiacylglycerol sulfoquinovosyldiacylglycerol and phosphatidylglycerol . the ph domain of phospholipase used as a positive control interacted specifically with _PROTEIN_ as reported previously and his tagged _PROTEIN_ alone used as a negative control bound to lipids very weakly . to confirm that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ bind to _PROTEIN_ liposome pull down assays were also performed . as shown in figure _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ but not _PROTEIN_ bound to _PROTEIN_ . since _PROTEIN_ is present in chloroplast _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are probably able to interact with _PROTEIN_ in vivo . chloroplast _LOCATION_ contain neither ps nor cl thus they would not be targets for _PROTEIN_ binding on the chloroplast _LOCATION_ . because _PROTEIN_ localizes to _LOCATION_ as well as chloroplasts and _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ probably contain ps _PROTEIN_ may bind to ps on _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . in this study we focused on the functions of _PROTEIN_ which interacts with _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in chloroplast division . to examine the relationship between chloroplast division and _PROTEIN_ we performed _PROTEIN_ inhibition assays . wortmannin inhibits phosphatidylinositol kinase _PROTEIN_ at nanomolar concentrations and inhibits both _PROTEIN_ and type iii _PROTEIN_ at micromolar concentrations . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ phosphorylate specific positions in the inositol _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ and produce _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ respectively . phenylarsine oxide _PROTEIN_ and are used as specific inhibitors of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ respectively . wild type seedlings were grown on medium containing wm _PROTEIN_ or . all three inhibitors impaired plant growth . when d old seedlings were treated with inhibitors for d fresh weight per seedling was mg for wm mg for _PROTEIN_ and mg for whereas it was mg for _METHOD_ used as a control . even though plant growth was inhibited the sizes of mesophyll cells were similar between inhibitor treated and untreated plants when inhibitors were used at the above concentrations . we then compared the size and number of chloroplasts between inhibitor treated and untreated seedlings . chloroplasts in the leaf cells of plants treated with wm or _PROTEIN_ were smaller and more numerous than those in plants grown without inhibitors . wm treatment at and also increased the number of chloroplasts but the increase was more significant at wm . chloroplasts treated with were pale and deformed but the size and number of chloroplasts were similar to those in the untreated plants . to confirm that the treatments with wm or _PROTEIN_ diminished cellular _PROTEIN_ transgenic plants overexpressing the _PROTEIN_ biosensor _METHOD_ were treated with wm _PROTEIN_ or . is a lipid binding domain that specifically binds _PROTEIN_ . the _METHOD_ of _METHOD_ was localized to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ in the cells of plants treated with or _METHOD_ indicating that _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ present in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ of these plants . by contrast the _METHOD_ of _METHOD_ was localized _PROTEIN_ in the cytoplasm of _PROTEIN_ treated cells as reported previously indicating that _PROTEIN_ free _METHOD_ was present in the cytoplasm of _PROTEIN_ treated plants . this finding suggests that the level of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in the cells of _PROTEIN_ treated plants . in plants treated with wm _METHOD_ appeared to be partially localized in the cytoplasm . we measured _PROTEIN_ levels in the isolated intact chloroplasts prepared from plants treated with wm _PROTEIN_ or _METHOD_ . when wild type plants were treated with wm or _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ levels in the chloroplasts _PROTEIN_ dramatically compared with that in the chloroplasts of _METHOD_ treated plants . on the other hand the amount of _PROTEIN_ in the chloroplasts of treated plants was only slightly _PROTEIN_ compared with that in the chloroplasts from the _METHOD_ treated plants . these results suggest that the level of _PROTEIN_ was lowered in chloroplasts by treatment with wm or _PROTEIN_ with an accompanying positive effect on the rate of chloroplast division . four _PROTEIN_ genes _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ have been identified in arabidopsis . to identify the _PROTEIN_ involved in production of _PROTEIN_ in the outer envelope _LOCATION_ of chloroplasts green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ fusion proteins were transiently _PROTEIN_ under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus promoter in guard cells of broad bean . because we were not able to obtain the _PROTEIN_ transcripts encoding an active _PROTEIN_ catalytic domain we used _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion constructs . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ exhibited a dot like pattern . _PROTEIN_ was shown previously to be localized to the trans _LOCATION_ network . _PROTEIN_ interacts with _PROTEIN_ a rab _PROTEIN_ specifically localized to the tgn through a novel homology domain specific to eukaryotic type _PROTEIN_ . the dot like pattern of _METHOD_ may indicate that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ is localized to the tgn . by contrast diffused _METHOD_ was observed throughout the _LOCATION_ in cells _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . to further examine the localization of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ we also _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ under the control of their respective promoters in arabidopsis . when _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ heterozygous plants homozygous plants carrying a _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ gene were obtained . because null mutations of _PROTEIN_ are lethal we conclude that the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ transgene complemented the mutation and that _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ is functional . _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ signals were detected in leaf and root cells but the signals of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in plants _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ driven by their own promoters were too weak to determine the intracellular localization especially in mesophyll cells because of the high level of background chlorophyll _METHOD_ . strong signals were detected in the anthers of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ or _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plants and in the stigma of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ plants . as shown in figure _METHOD_ was observed in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and throughout the _LOCATION_ in root cells of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ or _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plants . bright speckles in the _LOCATION_ were also observed in some cells of both plants . _PROTEIN_ has a ph domain which binds specifically to _PROTEIN_ and the _METHOD_ fusion protein is localized in perinuclear _LOCATION_ when it is _PROTEIN_ in insect cells . our results suggest that _PROTEIN_ localizes in _LOCATION_ and the _LOCATION_ as does _PROTEIN_ in mammalian cells . the localization of _PROTEIN_ has not been demonstrated although it was reported that the novel homology domain of _PROTEIN_ interacts with _PROTEIN_ as does that of _PROTEIN_ . therefore the speckles in the _LOCATION_ of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plants may indicate that _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ is localized to the tgn by _PROTEIN_ recruitment as does _PROTEIN_ . however the finding that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signal was also detected in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and throughout the _LOCATION_ suggests that a part of _PROTEIN_ is not recruited by _PROTEIN_ in contrast with the complete colocalization of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in the _LOCATION_ may convert _PROTEIN_ to _PROTEIN_ in the chloroplast outer envelope . we examined whether _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ is involved in the regulation of chloroplast division using the previously characterized null mutant . the number of chloroplasts was slightly but significantly higher in compared with the wild type . because plants homozygous for a t dna insertion in _PROTEIN_ could not be produced due to embryonic lethality we generated transgenic plants in which _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was knocked down . artificial micrornas with high specificity for _PROTEIN_ were _PROTEIN_ in wild type and mutant plants under the control of dexamethasone inducible promoters to downregulate _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ by rna interference . when _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was transiently knocked down the levels of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in chloroplasts the number of chloroplasts increased and their size was diminished compared with noninduced plants . these results indicate that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ negatively regulate the rate of chloroplast division and that _PROTEIN_ is the _PROTEIN_ contributor to the regulation . because _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ bound _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ interacts with _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ we examined whether _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are involved in the regulation of chloroplast division by _PROTEIN_ . we treated the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants and a _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant with _PROTEIN_ . the number of chloroplasts was fold higher in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutant plants grown with _PROTEIN_ than without _PROTEIN_ . by contrast _PROTEIN_ treatment had much less of an effect on chloroplast number in the _PROTEIN_ mutant although the difference between _PROTEIN_ treated and untreated plants was significant . the number of chloroplasts was similar in _PROTEIN_ treated and untreated _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant plants . knockdown of _PROTEIN_ in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutants caused similar results . these results indicate that _PROTEIN_ has a major role in the regulation of chloroplast division mediated by _PROTEIN_ . we also treated plants overexpressing _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ . overexpression of _PROTEIN_ and/or _PROTEIN_ resulted in an increased number of chloroplasts in the transgenic plants compared with wild type plants as reported previously . _PROTEIN_ treatment caused an additional increase in chloroplast numbers in the overexpressing lines . by contrast the numbers of chloroplasts in _PROTEIN_ overexpressing plants and wild type plants were similar as reported previously but the effect of _PROTEIN_ treatment was enhanced by the overexpression of _PROTEIN_ . the number of chloroplasts was times higher in _PROTEIN_ plants treated with _PROTEIN_ than in untreated _PROTEIN_ plants but it was only times higher in wild type plants treated with _PROTEIN_ than in untreated wild type plants . chloroplast number increased fold in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plants by _PROTEIN_ treatment but increased only fold in _PROTEIN_ plants treated with _PROTEIN_ . these results indicate that _PROTEIN_ is also involved in the regulation of chloroplast division mediated by _PROTEIN_ although _PROTEIN_ is not indispensable to the regulation . pdv protein levels were shown previously to determine the rate of chloroplast division . elevated levels of pdv proteins increase the number of chloroplasts and _PROTEIN_ pdv levels have the opposite effect suggesting that _PROTEIN_ might regulate the levels of pdv proteins . therefore we compared the levels of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ treated and untreated plants . _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ under the control of the _PROTEIN_ promoter in the homozygous _PROTEIN_ knockout mutant and the _PROTEIN_ protein was detected using an anti _METHOD_ antibody . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was also detected in the same samples using an anti _PROTEIN_ antibody . immunoblot analyses showed that the levels of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were similar in the _PROTEIN_ treated and untreated plants . these results suggest that the increase in chloroplast number in the cells of _PROTEIN_ treated plants was not caused by an increase in pdv protein levels . we also compared the levels of _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ treated and untreated plants . _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ under the control of the _PROTEIN_ promoter in the homozygous _PROTEIN_ knockout mutant . the level of _PROTEIN_ increased in the total extracts and isolated intact chloroplasts of _PROTEIN_ treated _PROTEIN_ plants . when total extracts of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plants were fractionated by centrifugation _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was detected primarily in the low speed pellet _PROTEIN_ consisting mostly of chloroplasts and partly in the soluble fraction . _PROTEIN_ treatment significantly increased _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ levels in the _PROTEIN_ fractions of _PROTEIN_ plants _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ under the control of either the _PROTEIN_ or promoter . in addition the level of _PROTEIN_ in the soluble fraction of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ overexpressing _PROTEIN_ plants treated with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ relative to untreated overexpressing plants even though the total _PROTEIN_ level increased slightly . overexpression of _PROTEIN_ had no effect on the level or localization of _PROTEIN_ . to further examine the localization of _PROTEIN_ we observed _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plants treated with _METHOD_ or _PROTEIN_ using _METHOD_ microscopy . _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ signals were observed with higher frequency at the midpoint of chloroplasts in the cells of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ plants treated with _PROTEIN_ than in untreated plants . in several chloroplasts of _PROTEIN_ treated plants _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was visible as small puncta distributed over the chloroplast envelope . _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ signals associated with the chloroplast surface also increased in the cells of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ plants treated with _PROTEIN_ compared with untreated plants . large aggregations were often observed in the _LOCATION_ of untreated _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ plants these aggregations were diminished in the cells of _PROTEIN_ treated plants . these results indicate that _PROTEIN_ affects the localization of _PROTEIN_ which is recruited to chloroplasts by _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and our results highlight the importance of _PROTEIN_ for _PROTEIN_ regulation . we conclude that _PROTEIN_ regulates the recruitment of _PROTEIN_ to chloroplasts by _PROTEIN_ .
