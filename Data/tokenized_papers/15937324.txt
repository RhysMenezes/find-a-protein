lov kelch _PROTEIN_ is an f box protein that has been postulated to function centrally or near to the circadian clock oscillator . as a first step to determine which proteins act as substrates of _PROTEIN_ yeast two hybrid screening was performed using _PROTEIN_ as bait and two interaction _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were isolated . the transiently _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ gus fusion protein was localized in the _LOCATION_ of arabidopsis petiole cells . _PROTEIN_ and other _PROTEIN_ family proteins could also interact with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ binding site in _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ was near the center of each protein . the _PROTEIN_ motif in _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ was not sufficient for interaction with _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ recognized _PROTEIN_ with f box and kelch repeat containing regions while it recognized _PROTEIN_ with an lov domain . when _PROTEIN_ was fused with cyan _METHOD_ proein _METHOD_ and transiently _PROTEIN_ in onion epidermal cells _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ signals were localized in the _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ . both yellow _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ were located in the _LOCATION_ forming _LOCATION_ bodies when they were transiently _PROTEIN_ . however co _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ with _METHOD_ fused to either _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ resulted in the recruitment of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in _LOCATION_ bodies . furthermore the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ signals co localized with signals for _METHOD_ which is a marker for cajal bodies . these results suggest the possibility that _PROTEIN_ functions with _PROTEIN_ family proteins in the _LOCATION_ bodies .
we used yeast two hybrid screening to isolate proteins that interact with _PROTEIN_ . yeast cells were co transformed with the vector carrying _PROTEIN_ full length cdna and with a clone cdna library in the vector that had been prepared with rna from arabidopsis rosette leaves . two hundred and twenty candidate clones were selected by complementation on sd medium amended with mm amino triazole _PROTEIN_ but lacking adenine histidine leucine and tryptophan . as a second screening plasmids from candidate clones were isolated and re co transformed into yeast cells with _PROTEIN_ . among the plasmid pools isolated gave auxotrophic complementation of which colonies could grow in the presence of mm _PROTEIN_ . twenty of these colonies could grow at mm _PROTEIN_ and colonies could grow at mm _PROTEIN_ . as a third screening we sequenced all of the cdna isolates from the colonies that grew at mm _PROTEIN_ . most of the co transformed clones isolated after three rounds of screening were rrna chloroplast or _LOCATION_ proteins and out of frame clones . clones for chloroplast and _LOCATION_ proteins were eliminated since _PROTEIN_ is thought to reside _PROTEIN_ in _LOCATION_ . other clones were a dnaj like protein drought induced unknown proteins a serine/threonine protein kinase and a zinc finger protein . as a fourth screening we co transformed yeast cells with each one of five cdna plasmids and with empty vector . as a result two clones activated the two hybrid system without _PROTEIN_ . therefore we concluded that the drought induced unknown protein _PROTEIN_ and the zinc finger protein _PROTEIN_ could be _PROTEIN_ binding proteins . _PROTEIN_ was initially isolated as a drought inducible cdna clone but there is no more information about this gene . both of our _PROTEIN_ clones were partial and corresponded to a truncated peptide either from amino acids or so we performed the two hybrid assay with a full length _PROTEIN_ reverse transcription pcr cdna . full length _PROTEIN_ interacted with _PROTEIN_ and other members of the lkp/ztl protein family . interactions also occurred when the dna binding and activation domains of were exchanged . there were no effects of light on two hybrid interactions in the red far red blue green or white light spectra at m s . to visualize the intracellular localization of _PROTEIN_ the cauliflower mosaic virus promoter derived _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ fusion protein construct and a vector control were introduced into arabidopsis petiole cells by bombardment . _PROTEIN_ gus activity was localized in the _LOCATION_ but vector control gus activity was not limited to any cellular region or organelle . thus subcellular _PROTEIN_ co locates with _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ is a member of the _PROTEIN_ family of proteins and has two b box type zinc finger motifs and a _PROTEIN_ motif . the _PROTEIN_ motif is conserved in all _PROTEIN_ and family proteins while some _PROTEIN_ proteins contain only one b box motif . since the _PROTEIN_ cdna isolated from yeast cells was truncated we examined the molecular interactions between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ using a full length _PROTEIN_ cdna and a series of deletions . full length _PROTEIN_ activated the reporter genes in the absence of _PROTEIN_ . an n terminal deletion of _PROTEIN_ could also activate the system without _PROTEIN_ . however both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ could activate the reporter genes depending on the presence of _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ corresponded to the clone that had been isolated from two hybrid screening . neither _PROTEIN_ nor _PROTEIN_ having deletions that contained the _PROTEIN_ motif could activate the reporter genes . these results suggested that the interaction between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ required the _PROTEIN_ region containing amino acids . none of the interactions was affected by light at m s . we also examined the two hybrid interactions of lkp/ztl family members with other _PROTEIN_ family members . since the zinc finger containing region of _PROTEIN_ activated the reporter genes without a prey insert we eliminated the zinc finger motif from all tested _PROTEIN_ proteins . vector or for _PROTEIN_ proteins was used to _PROTEIN_ background activation levels . as a result _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ interacted with _PROTEIN_ and some also interacted with _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ . as in interactions with _PROTEIN_ there was no observable effect of light on the two hybrid interaction . interaction between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ was examined using a series of n and c terminal deletion derivatives . _PROTEIN_ and a series of n terminal deleted mutants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ activated the reporter genes independently of _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ interacted significantly with _PROTEIN_ in this assay . as for the c terminal domain deletion mutant series _PROTEIN_ interacted with _PROTEIN_ while _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ gave activation in the absence of _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ motif of _PROTEIN_ did not interact with _PROTEIN_ as seen in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . the domains of _PROTEIN_ that are required for the interaction with _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ were investigated by the two hybrid system . either the f box or kelch repeat containing region was sufficient for interaction with _PROTEIN_ while the lov domain containing region was necessary and sufficient for interaction with _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ was reported to be localized in the _LOCATION_ . _PROTEIN_ is a transcription _PROTEIN_ protein and _LOCATION_ partitioning is thought to be important for its transcriptional activity . _PROTEIN_ was also reported to be localized in the _LOCATION_ . to examine the subcellular co localization of those proteins cyan _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ yellow _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusions were constructed . to confirm the reliability of our _METHOD_ detection system we first bombarded _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ alone and acquired an image through the _METHOD_ channel . the _METHOD_ signal of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ proteins was detected through the _METHOD_ channel in an exposure time of _METHOD_ . however _METHOD_ signals were not detected through the _METHOD_ channel in exposure times of or _METHOD_ . even with an exposure time of _METHOD_ very faint _METHOD_ signals were detected through the _METHOD_ channel . therefore we determined that the exposure time was < _METHOD_ in this co localization assay . each fusion gene was put under control of the camv promoter and bombarded into onion epidermal cells . _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ proteins were localized in the _LOCATION_ and formed _LOCATION_ bodies when they were co _PROTEIN_ with _METHOD_ . _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was observed in the _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ when it was co _PROTEIN_ with _METHOD_ . when _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ or _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ were co bombarded the nucleo cytoplasmic partitioning ratio of _METHOD_ associated _METHOD_ increased and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ formed _LOCATION_ bodies . the position of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ bodies was perfectly co incident with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ or _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ bodies . co localization of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was also confirmed by three dimensional image reconstruction . these co localization patterns were not affected by incubation illumination conditions that we tested . as for _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ signals were also co localized when they were co _PROTEIN_ in onion cells . we examined cells . in cells _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ signals were detected only in _LOCATION_ while _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ signals were detected in _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ . however both _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ signals were localized in _LOCATION_ bodies of five of the examined cells . two markers were employed to define further the nature of the _LOCATION_ bodies . one is _LOCATION_ which is a molecular marker of cajal bodies and the other is _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ which is a marker for spliceosomal speckles . in onion cells _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ signals were co localized while _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signals were not coincident with those for _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ or _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ .
plasmid dna templates for sequencing were prepared and dna sequences were determined as described previously . the genetyx and sequencher software _METHOD_ were used for the dna sequence analysis . the two hybrid assay was performed as described . cdna library construction and subsequent two hybrid screening were according to the manufacturer s instructions with rna isolated from rosette leaves of arabidopsis which had been grown under _PROTEIN_ conditions of h light and h dark at and harvested at h intervals from the onset of illumination . a full length _PROTEIN_ cdna with the activating domain was used as bait . columbia versions of cdna for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were obtained by rt pcr with revertra dash or from _PROTEIN_ bio resource center . clones were pcr amplified to generate suitable restriction enzyme sites subcloned into pgem t easy vector verified by sequencing and subcloned into and vectors . the primers used for pcr were the following ggatccgaattcatggacgctgattccaag and ggatccgaattcgacttcatcgaaaatggc for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ for _PROTEIN_ aagatctgttcagctgaggaagttccggga and aagatctctaaaatgtaggtacaagtccga for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ for _PROTEIN_ . for _PROTEIN_ deletions each construct was pcr amplified subcloned into pgem t easy vector verified by sequencing and ligated into two hybrid vectors . the forward primers used for pcr were _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and the reverse primers were _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . for _PROTEIN_ deletions each construct was pcr amplified subcloned sequenced and ligated into two hybrid vectors . the forward primers used for pcr were _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and the reverse primers were _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . for immunoblot analysis yeast cells were grown in ml of ypd medium for h pelleted by centrifugation and frozen in liquid nitrogen . the pellets were resuspended in of extraction buffer _PROTEIN_ and homogenized . crude cell extract was loaded onto each lane and proteins were separated by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and electro transferred onto nylon _LOCATION_ . proteins were detected by anti cmyc or anti hemagglutinin antibodies . full length _PROTEIN_ cdna was excised with bamhi and fused in frame to a gus reporter gene under control of the camv promoter in the binary vector . a aliquot of the resultant plasmid dna was bombarded into arabidopsis petioles with a _PROTEIN_ biolistic particle delivery system . the bombarded petioles were _PROTEIN_ at for at least h until they were observed microscopically for signs of successful transformation . as a control was also bombarded into petioles . gus staining and diamidino phenylindole observation were performed as described previously . transient _PROTEIN_ vectors that carry camv _METHOD_ and camv _METHOD_ were used for co bombardment experiments . full length _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ clones were cut with bamhi end filled with dna polymerase and ligated into the blunted bglii site of or to form in frame fusion genes as verified by sequencing . _METHOD_ and were used as cajal body and _LOCATION_ speckles markers respectively . a aliquot of each plasmid dna was bombarded into onion epidermal cells . _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ signals were detected with a microscope with a ccd camera retiga exi fast cooled mono bit and standard _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ filter . the images were analyzed with metamorph imaging software version _PROTEIN_ . three dimensional deconvoluted images were constructed using autodeblur/autovisualize software . supplementary material mentioned in the article is available to online subscribers at the journal website www.pcp.oupjournals.org .
