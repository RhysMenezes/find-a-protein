_LOCATION_ compartments associated with leaf senescence and the subcellular localization of the senescence specific cysteine protease _PROTEIN_ were studied using specific _METHOD_ markers the _PROTEIN_ of reporter genes and the analysis of high pressure frozen/freeze substituted samples . senescence associated _LOCATION_ with intense proteolytic activity develop in the peripheral cytoplasm of mesophyll and guard cells in arabidopsis and soybean . the _LOCATION_ identity of these compartments was confirmed by immunolabeling with specific antibody markers . savs and the central _LOCATION_ differ in their acidity and tonoplast composition savs are more acidic than the central _LOCATION_ and whereas the tonoplast of central _LOCATION_ is highly enriched in _PROTEIN_ the tonoplast of savs lacks this aquaporin . the _PROTEIN_ of a _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein in transgenic arabidopsis plants shows that _PROTEIN_ localizes to savs . the analysis of gus transgenic plants indicates that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in senescing leaves is restricted to sav containing cells for example mesophyll and guard cells . a homozygous _PROTEIN_ arabidopsis mutant develops savs and does not show any visually detectable phenotypical alteration during senescence indicating that _PROTEIN_ is not required either for sav formation or for progression of visual _METHOD_ of senescence . the presence of two types of _LOCATION_ in senescing leaves could provide different lytic compartments for the dismantling of specific cellular components . the possible origin and functions of savs during leaf senescence are discussed .
