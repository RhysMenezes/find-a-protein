normal progression of genetic recombination requires timely degradation of many proteins but little is known about the proteolytic mechanism . the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ protein is a component of the _PROTEIN_ cullin f box protein ubiquitin ligases that target a variety of proteins for degradation via the proteasome pathway . previous studies indicate that the early defects of the mutant _PROTEIN_ occur in a prophase i period overlapping with the period of homologous recombination . we provide evidence in this report that _PROTEIN_ is predominately _PROTEIN_ from leptotene to pachytene and negatively regulates recombination . first the _PROTEIN_ transcript was found not to co exist with that of its closest homolog _PROTEIN_ only during prophase i of male meiosis suggesting that _PROTEIN_ is functionally non redundant only in prophase i . second the peak level of an _PROTEIN_ green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ fusion protein _PROTEIN_ by an _PROTEIN_ promoter region occurred only from leptotene to pachytene . the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in a dominant negative fashion resulted in abnormal tetrads resembling those of the _PROTEIN_ mutant supporting that the _PROTEIN_ timing of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in male meiocytes reflects the _PROTEIN_ timing of the endogenous _PROTEIN_ . lastly using a marker for recombination events a significant increase in recombination frequency was detected in plants heterozygous for _PROTEIN_ . these results indicate that _PROTEIN_ normally plays a repressive role in male recombination in arabidopsis .
the _PROTEIN_ male meiotic defects indicate that _PROTEIN_ plays an essential role in male meiocytes . to uncover for what processes that _PROTEIN_ is required the timing of _PROTEIN_ s action in male meiocytes needs to be determined . toward this end total rna samples from meiocytes of wt individual anthers at different cell cycle stages were first prepared for detection of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ transcripts using an rt pcr pcr approach . inclusion of _PROTEIN_ the function equivalent homolog of _PROTEIN_ was also to test the possibility that the transcriptional periods of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ only partially overlap so that _PROTEIN_ can not fully compensate the loss of _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ male meiocytes . the _PROTEIN_ transcript was detected at all stages examined including preleptotene leptotene zygotene pachytene diplotene metaphase i telophase ii and cytokinesis whereas the _PROTEIN_ transcript was not detected in prophase i but at all the _PROTEIN_ stages . even though the experiment did not reveal a cell cycle specific transcription pattern for _PROTEIN_ the lack of overlap in transcription between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ during prophase i suggests that the meiotic defects of _PROTEIN_ likely result from the lack of both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in prophase i . to further investigate the dynamics of the _PROTEIN_ protein in the male meiotic cell cycle transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ an _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ under the control of an _PROTEIN_ promoter region was made and characterized . the _METHOD_ signal was most pronounced from leptotene to pachytene in both the cytoplasm and the _LOCATION_ but weak in other stages of meiosis . these observations indicate that the amount of _PROTEIN_ likely fluctuates in the cell cycle with a peak level occurring from leptotene to pachytene . therefore the period from leptotene to pachytene appears to be critical for the function of _PROTEIN_ which is consistent with the previous findings that the earliest detectable defects in _PROTEIN_ male meiocytes occur in a period corresponding to that from leptotene to pachytene . the correspondence of the _PROTEIN_ timing of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ to that of the endogenous _PROTEIN_ is supported by a dominant negative effect of the transgene . from eight independent transformations for generation of the transgenic plants only three gave rise to transformants after screening several thousand of seeds of the generation from each transformation . a strong _METHOD_ signal could only be detected in the plants from one of the three transformations a _METHOD_ signal could hardly be detected in the plants from the other two transformations . four of the plants exhibiting a strong _METHOD_ signal were small and had inflorescence branches of either low or no fertility . the other eight plants also appeared stunted in growth and had reduced fertility to various degrees . the plants of low fertility produced both hygromycin sensitive and resistant plants indicating that the plants were heterozygous for the transgene . therefore the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ had a dominant negative effect on the plants growth and fertility . consistent with this dominant negative effect the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgene failed to complement the _PROTEIN_ male meiotic defects after the transgene from a plant with relatively good fertility and a high _METHOD_ signal was crossed into _PROTEIN_ two antibiotic selection for both the _PROTEIN_ mutation and the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgene in the generation did not eliminate male sterile plants with meiotic defects resembling those in _PROTEIN_ . further tetrads from the anthers of the sterile and plants contained microspores varying in size and number reminiscent of the abnormal tetrads in _PROTEIN_ anthers . this observation suggests that only when the ask _METHOD_ was _PROTEIN_ simultaneously in male meiocytes as the endogenous _PROTEIN_ and had a dominant negative effect could such effect of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ on male meiosis be produced . the dominant negative effect could presumably result from the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ competing with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and possibly other asks for binding to the cullins but failing to bind the f box proteins depleting the functional scfs . this is a likely scenario since the _METHOD_ is fused to the c terminus of _PROTEIN_ and the c termini of _PROTEIN_ proteins are critical for binding to f box proteins . the peak level of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ coincides with the recombination process . to determine whether _PROTEIN_ plays a role in recombination the _PROTEIN_ recombination reporter line was crossed with _PROTEIN_ . contains two partial but overlapping gus coding regions separated by a hygromycin selection marker . upon recombination the function of the gus gene can be restored with the simultaneous loss of the hygromycin marker . therefore the frequency of either gus positive pollen or hygromycin sensitive plants of the next generation can be used to assess the recombination frequency . because the transposon insertion in _PROTEIN_ carries a gus gene that gives a gus background and because _PROTEIN_ is male sterile the gus staining approach and the homozygous _PROTEIN_ mutant plants were not employed in this study . instead frequencies of hygromycin sensitive plants from plants homozygous for but either heterozygous for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or being wt at the _PROTEIN_ locus _PROTEIN_ were investigated . of the s were hyg /hyg when their parents were in the hyg /hyg and _PROTEIN_ background whereas of s were hyg /hyg when their parents were in the hyg /hyg and _PROTEIN_ background . assuming that recombination in female meiosis is not affected by the _PROTEIN_ mutation the male recombination frequency in the _PROTEIN_ plants would be approximately times of that in the _PROTEIN_ plants . even assuming that _PROTEIN_ affects recombination to the same extent in male and female meioses the recombination frequency in the _PROTEIN_ plants would still be approximately times of that in the _PROTEIN_ plants . these results demonstrate that the recombination frequency even in the heterozygous _PROTEIN_ plants was significantly increased . therefore _PROTEIN_ normally represses recombination in male meiosis . given that _PROTEIN_ is predicted to be involved in proteolysis these results raise the possibility that _PROTEIN_ is normally involved in the proteolysis of proteins that positively regulate recombination .
the _PROTEIN_ and the wild type plants were in the landsberg _LOCATION_ background and grown on artificial soil in a growth chamber at under a h light and h dark photoperiod . for investigating recombination frequency the recombination marker line was crossed with _PROTEIN_ and the plants were grown on plates containing murashige and skoog _METHOD_ agar medium supplemented with mg/l hygromycin . a subset of the plants were also grown on a separate set of _METHOD_ agar plates supplemented with mg/l kanamycin to determine whether their parent plants were wt at the _PROTEIN_ locus or they were heterozygous or homozygous for the _PROTEIN_ mutation . to detect the transcription of _PROTEIN_ and its closest homolog _PROTEIN_ during the male meiotic cell cycle meiocytes at different stages from medial anthers were manually dissected out of each anther under a dissecting scope . the meiocytes in prophase i from each anther locule were released as a cell clump that was manually transferred for rna extraction with a human hair affixed to a wooden applicator . meiocytes of _PROTEIN_ stages were similarly dissected for rna extraction except that the tissues other than meiocytes were manually removed . care was taken to minimize damage to the anthers to reduce the chances of contamination by other anther tissues . the cell cycle stage of a sample was determined by observations of the remaining dapi stained fixed meiocytes and tapetal cells from the corresponding anther or from another medial anther of the same bud . mrnas of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in the samples were detected using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction followed by a second round of pcr using nested primers . sample contamination with mrnas from other cells was assessed by rt pcr pcr using nested primers specific to the highly _PROTEIN_ tapetum specific _PROTEIN_ gene . tapetum is the cell layer surrounding the meiocytes . if _PROTEIN_ was not detected the samples were likely free of contamination . for generation of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ transgenic plants a genomic fragment containing base pairs upstream of the _PROTEIN_ start codon and the coding region was cloned into the to create a _METHOD_ fusion to the c terminus of _PROTEIN_ . the transgene was introduced into wt plants via agrobacterium mediated transformation . seeds were screened for transformants on _METHOD_ plates supplemented with mg/l hygromycin . the _METHOD_ as well as the bright field images were taken using a nikon _METHOD_ microscope and a spot digital camera with a fixed exposure time and the same brightness and contrast adjustments in adobe photoshop for the _METHOD_ images . fresh plant samples were used for the _METHOD_ studies and their cell cycle stages were similarly determined as those for the rna preparations .
