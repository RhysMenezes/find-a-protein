during oilseed embryo development _PROTEIN_ from sucrose is utilized for fatty acid synthesis in the _LOCATION_ . the role of _LOCATION_ glycolysis in arabidopsis embryo oil accumulation was investigated . genes encoding enolases and phosphoglyceromutases were identified and activities and subcellular locations were established by _PROTEIN_ of recombinant and green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ proteins . mutant arabidopsis plants lacking putative _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ were characterized with respect to isoform composition and embryo oil content . in the developing embryo _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ account for most or all of the _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ eno activity respectively and accounts for most or all of the _LOCATION_ pglym activity . the _PROTEIN_ and mutants in which _LOCATION_ eno and pglym activities were undetectable had amounts of seed oil at maturity . it is concluded that although _LOCATION_ of developing arabidopsis embryos have the capacity to carry out the lower part of the glycolytic pathway the _LOCATION_ glycolytic pathway alone is sufficient to support the flux from to phosphoenolpyruvate required for oil production . the results highlight the importance for oil production of translocators that facilitate interchange of glycolytic intermediates between the _LOCATION_ and the _LOCATION_ stroma .
arabidopsis contains three eno genes _GENE_ _PROTEIN_ _GENE_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _GENE_ . their predicted translation products are polypeptides of and amino acids respectively . in phylogenetic analyses the three arabidopsis enolases cluster closely with other plant eno sequences . they show high similarity at the level of predicted amino acid sequence to putative enolases from rice as well as known enolases from e. coli yeast and humans . analysis of publicly available microarray data shows that _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ in all organs and developmental stages examined and at levels higher than _PROTEIN_ and in all instances except pollen . _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ more highly in roots siliques and seeds than in other organs . analysis of the _PROTEIN_ pattern of _PROTEIN_ by semiquantitative and by staining for activity in arabidopsis plants transformed with an _PROTEIN_ fusion revealed that it is also highly _PROTEIN_ in the shoot apex and the trichomes of young leaves . is _PROTEIN_ at lower levels than _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ in all organs . during seed development _PROTEIN_ levels of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ peak at the torpedo stage . thereafter _PROTEIN_ transcript is almost undetectable while _PROTEIN_ transcript abundance falls to about of peak levels . transcript is not detectable at any stage of seed development . _PROTEIN_ and are predicted to be _LOCATION_ proteins while _PROTEIN_ has a predicted transit peptide spanning amino acids that putatively confers _LOCATION_ localization . _PROTEIN_ has recently been shown to be _LOCATION_ through analysis of the pattern of _PROTEIN_ of a _METHOD_ fusion protein in an arabidopsis cell culture . here this analysis was extended to all three eno gene products . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and fused at their to _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ alone were transiently _PROTEIN_ in n. benthamiana leaves under control of the camv promoter . transformed areas were examined by confocal laser microscopy . the _METHOD_ signal from _METHOD_ completely overlapped that of chlorophyll _METHOD_ indicating that _PROTEIN_ is located in the chloroplast . by contrast _METHOD_ _METHOD_ for _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ was observed in the _LOCATION_ . _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was also observed in _LOCATION_ as reported by lee et al . . the _METHOD_ signal from _METHOD_ alone was detected in the _LOCATION_ and in the _LOCATION_ . immunoblot analysis of soluble protein extracts from infiltrated leaves using an antiserum for _METHOD_ confirmed the accumulation of chimeric proteins of the predicted size . recombinant _METHOD_ of both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ proteins possess enolase activity in vitro . consistent with this both proteins were able to restore the ability of the e. coli mutant strain to grow on _PROTEIN_ . this bacterial strain lacks enolase and is able to grow on glycerol but not _PROTEIN_ . it was previously used to test the functionality of a cdna encoding a putative enolase from maize . to extend this analysis to the whole enzyme family was tested for in vitro activity and for the ability to complement the e. coli mutant . with a epitope tag was _PROTEIN_ in e. coli . _PROTEIN_ was also _PROTEIN_ as a comparison . both yielded soluble proteins which were purified by immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography . _PROTEIN_ was active in vitro as reported by lee et al . . the specific activity of the purified protein was protein and the km with respect to was c. . by contrast had no detectable activity and was unable to complement the growth phenotype of e. coli . alignment of the ateno protein sequences with that of yeast enolase showed that residue of the yeast enzyme known to act as a general acid in the reaction mechanism is conserved in the same context in and but is substituted by an aspartate residue in . a search in other plant genomes with the consensus sequence showed that the same aspartate substitution occurs in a predicted protein in rice and in two predicted eno proteins in grape although not in predicted eno proteins in poplar or the moss physcomitrella . however in both and the predicted proteins from grape the consensus sequence gdegg is changed to gedgg so the retention of e in an adjacent position may allow it to act as a general acid in the reaction mechanism . in rice the corresponding sequence is gddgg but in this case e > d may be a functionally conservative substitution and the new acidic reside may still be able to fulfil the required role . it is not known whether sequences from plants other than arabidopsis encode catalytically active enzymes . however substitution of by glutamine in the yeast enolase results in a dramatic reduction of kcat . to test the effects of these substitutions of presumed catalytically important residues we _PROTEIN_ the and the mutant versions and in the . coli strain . although bacteria _PROTEIN_ the could not grow on _PROTEIN_ as the sole _PROTEIN_ source bacteria harbouring showed limited growth and the _PROTEIN_ of fully complemented the growth phenotype of e. coli on _PROTEIN_ media . thus the lack of detectable activity of is attributable at least in part to substitutions of two residues in the active site . overall these data suggest that of the three arabidopsis eno genes _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ encode functional enolases and account for all the enolase activity in arabidopsis embryos . to discover the importance of _LOCATION_ enolase in lipid accumulation in arabidopsis seeds three insertion lines were identified from the salk and collections in which the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ was predicted to be affected . these were _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . flanking sequence tags corresponding to left borders were isolated by pcr from the putative mutants and sequenced to confirm the insertion sites . these were and nucleotides relative to the _PROTEIN_ start codon in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ respectively . to investigate the impact of the insertions on _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ primer pairs were designed to amplify cdna sequences corresponding to positions flanking the insertion site . the correct cdna sequences were amplified from _PROTEIN_ plants . no transcript was detectable in homozygous _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . transcript abundances of _PROTEIN_ were higher in the _PROTEIN_ mutant than in the syngenic line . the vector _PROTEIN_ used in the generation of this line has a camv promoter immediately inside the right border _PROTEIN_ . a assay was used to determine the orientation of the insertion . primers amplified the correct _PROTEIN_ genomic dna fragment only in plants and not in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . a combination of primers together with either _PROTEIN_ or primers showed that the was integrated in the _PROTEIN_ direction close to and upstream of the of _PROTEIN_ . sequencing of the _PROTEIN_ verified that the camv promoter was located nucleotides upstream of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ start codon . thus in _PROTEIN_ insertion of the resulted in the deletion of c. nucleotides between and and their substitution by the such that positioning of the camv promoter adjacent to the _PROTEIN_ start codon resulted in increased _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ gene for further discussion of gene activation in insertion lines . analysis showed that transcript abundances of _PROTEIN_ and in the _PROTEIN_ mutants were the same as in plants . thus interpretation of any phenotypes in the _PROTEIN_ mutants is unlikely to be complicated by changes in _PROTEIN_ of the other eno _METHOD_ . monoq anion exchange chromatography of tissue extracts was used to separate the eno _METHOD_ . eno activity in extracts of developing siliques of plants eluted from the column in two peaks a major peak at c. mm nacl and a minor peak at c. mm nacl . by contrast activity from leaves eluted as a single peak in the same position as from siliques . to provide information about the identity of the peaks the elution profile of eno activity from developing siliques of the _PROTEIN_ mutant was examined . this mutant carries a recessive mutation in the _PROTEIN_ gene resulting in reduced _PROTEIN_ specific activity . in _PROTEIN_ extracts the size of the activity peak was the same as extracts of siliques from the same genetic background _PROTEIN_ but the size of the peak was significantly reduced . this indicates that is attributable to _PROTEIN_ and to _PROTEIN_ . the proposed subcellular location of _METHOD_ was supported by the impact of the _PROTEIN_ mutations on eno activity . in extracts of developing siliques of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ activity eluted from the monoq column as a single peak in the same position as peak in extracts of siliques . the minor peak was absent . by contrast the activity in in _PROTEIN_ extracts was strongly enhanced relative to that in extracts . these data are consistent with loss of the _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ activity in the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants and of _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . there was relatively little difference between and all three _PROTEIN_ mutant lines in the _LOCATION_ eno activity . plants lacking or overexpressing _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ grew at the same rate as syngenic plants in both and glasshouse conditions and no difference in vegetative and reproductive morphologies was observed . across three independently grown batches of plants there was no consistent difference in lipid content of mature seeds between the mutants and their corresponding . we next investigated the importance for fatty acid biosynthesis of conversion of to via _LOCATION_ pglym . a search for sequences in arabidopsis identified six putative pglym genes whose products clustered closely to _METHOD_ from other sources . two of the six putative _METHOD_ have predicted transit peptides spanning amino acids that may confer _LOCATION_ localization . interrogation of publicly available microarray data showed that _GENE_ transcript is readily detectable through much of embryo development including the period of rapid lipid accumulation and is substantially more abundant than _GENE_ transcript throughout this developmental period . the subcellular localization of the _GENE_ product was verified by transiently _PROTEIN_ fused at its to _METHOD_ in n. benthamiana leaves . the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ signal overlapped that of chlorophyll autofluoresence . this indicates that is a _LOCATION_ protein . immunoblot analysis of soluble protein extracts from infiltrated leaves using an antiserum for _METHOD_ confirmed the accumulation of chimeric protein of the predicted size . to discover the importance of in seed oil accumulation two independent insertion lines and were identified . the location of the insertions was confirmed by sequencing the . the insertions were at and nucleotides relative to the _PROTEIN_ start codons in and respectively . the effect of the mutations on function was investigated . first analysis showed that no transcript was detected in either line and therefore both mutants carry null alleles . second the impact of the mutations on pglym activity was examined by monoq anion exchange chromatography . pglym activity in extracts of developing siliques of plants eluted from the column in two distinct peaks a major peak at c. mm nacl and a minor peak at c. mm nacl . by contrast activity from leaves eluted as a single peak in the same position as the first peak from siliques . the elution profiles of activity from extracts of siliques of both mutants were the same as those from leaf extracts the second peak of pglym activity was absent . activity in the major peak was similar to that in plants on a protein basis . these results are consistent with the idea that the minor peak corresponds to the _LOCATION_ pglym isoform and that the and mutations result in loss of this isoform . plants homozygous for the insertions in were indistinguishable from syngenic control plants under both and glasshouse conditions . concentrations of seed lipids in mature seed of these mutants were very similar to those in plants .

plant mini kit . rna was treated with dnase i and cdna was synthesized with superscript ii reverse transcriptase . for semiquantitative the gene was used as a control . pcr conditions were as previously _PROTEIN_ with cycles for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and cycles for _PROTEIN_ and with primer pairs and enolabr _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ enolaf and enolabr _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ and . the cdnas of
