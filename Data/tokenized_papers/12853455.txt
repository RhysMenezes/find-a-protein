_PROTEIN_ a protein located in the outer envelope _LOCATION_ and the _LOCATION_ is an important component of the receptor complex for _LOCATION_ encoded chloroplast proteins . we investigated the molecular mechanism of protein import into chloroplasts by _PROTEIN_ using the _PROTEIN_ mutant which has a t dna insertion at _PROTEIN_ shows an albino phenotype and does not survive beyond the seedling stage due to a defect in protein import into chloroplasts . first we established that transiently _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in protoplasts obtained from the white leaf tissues of _PROTEIN_ plants complements the protein import defect into chloroplasts . using this transient _PROTEIN_ approach and a series of deletion mutants we demonstrated that the c terminal _LOCATION_ anchored domain is targeted to the chloroplast envelope _LOCATION_ in _PROTEIN_ protoplasts and is sufficient to complement the defect in protein import . the middle _PROTEIN_ domain plays an additional critical role in protein import the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants which have a mutation at the first and second _PROTEIN_ binding motifs respectively do not support protein import into chloroplasts . leaf cells of transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ the m domain in a _PROTEIN_ background contained nearly fully developed chloroplasts with respect to size and density of _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and displayed about half as much chlorophyll as wild type cells . in transgenic plants the isolated m domain localized to the envelope _LOCATION_ of chloroplasts but not the _LOCATION_ . based on these results we propose that the m domain is the minimal structure required to support protein import into chloroplasts while the g domain plays a regulatory role .
transient _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ supports protein import into chloroplasts in _PROTEIN_ investigated the role of _PROTEIN_ in protein import into chloroplasts using protoplasts derived from arabidopsis leaf tissues as an experimental system . in this system dna constructs encoding reporter proteins destined for the chloroplasts were introduced into protoplasts by the polyethylene glycol mediated transformation method and _PROTEIN_ of the encoded proteins was monitored at various subsequent time points . we employed two different approaches to analyze the _PROTEIN_ and targeting of the proteins . one is based on _PROTEIN_ fusion proteins including green or red _METHOD_ proteins _METHOD_ _METHOD_ followed by image analysis using a _METHOD_ microscope . the other is based on western blot analysis using antibodies to the _PROTEIN_ proteins . we employed a _METHOD_ fusion protein with the n terminal transit peptide of the small subunit of rubisco complex as a reporter protein as described previously . _METHOD_ microscopy analyses revealed that rbcs nt _METHOD_ is efficiently imported into chloroplasts in protoplasts derived from leaf tissues of wild type plants . in contrast _METHOD_ alone was observed as a diffuse pattern in the _LOCATION_ . to further confirm the localization of rbcs nt _METHOD_ we performed western blotting using proteins obtained from rbcs nt _METHOD_ transformed protoplasts . as shown in fig . the majority of rbcs nt _METHOD_ was detected at kda . furthermore the kda band co purified with chloroplasts in a percoll gradient indicating the presence of the protein within this organelle . a very weak band was sometimes detected at kda _METHOD_ in total protein extracts but not in chloroplast extracts this likely corresponds to the precursor rbcs nt _METHOD_ protein . the kda band may correspond to the mature protein because the n terminal transit peptide of chloroplast proteins is proteolytically processed during import . a band that is smaller than kda was also observed in the protein extracts which may be a product of additional proteolytic processing in chloroplasts . control _METHOD_ was detected at kda as expected . next we examined the import of rbcs nt _METHOD_ into chloroplasts in protoplasts derived from leaf tissues of _PROTEIN_ plants . we examined whether proteins can be imported into the undeveloped chloroplasts in _PROTEIN_ plants . _PROTEIN_ protoplasts prepared from the white leaf tissues of _PROTEIN_ plants were transformed with rbcs nt _METHOD_ and the reporter protein was localized by observing its green _METHOD_ under a _METHOD_ microscope . as shown in fig . a diffuse pattern of green _METHOD_ signals from rbcs nt _METHOD_ was detected and was similar to that of _METHOD_ alone except for a few punctate stains . the narrow strip patterns of _METHOD_ signals observed in these protoplasts are due to the _LOCATION_ that is confined between the large central _LOCATION_ and the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . a similar result was obtained with other reporter proteins such as ra nt _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . interestingly the _METHOD_ signals of rbcs nt _METHOD_ at the few punctate stains closely overlapped the red _METHOD_ of chlorophyll as depicted by the yellow signals . this suggests that although rbcs nt _METHOD_ is not efficiently imported into chloroplasts some portion of rbcs nt _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ protoplasts may be imported into the undeveloped chloroplasts . to further confirm the _METHOD_ pattern of rbcs nt _METHOD_ in _PROTEIN_ protoplasts protein extracts were prepared from transformed _PROTEIN_ protoplasts and examined by western blot analysis using an anti _METHOD_ antibody . rbcs nt _METHOD_ was detected as two strong bands at and kda . in _PROTEIN_ protoplasts the kda band was of total _PROTEIN_ rbcs nt _METHOD_ and the kda band was indicating that the amount of the precursor form is greatly increased in _PROTEIN_ protoplasts compared with the wild type protoplasts . these results are in agreement with the results obtained from the image analysis . next we examined whether transient _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ complements the loss of _PROTEIN_ with respect to protein import into chloroplasts in _PROTEIN_ protoplasts . we generated _PROTEIN_ tagged with a small epitope at the n terminus for detection by western blot . protoplasts obtained from _PROTEIN_ plants were co transformed with two plasmids rbcs nt _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ and localization of the reporter protein was examined . when co transformed with _PROTEIN_ the green _METHOD_ of rbcs nt _METHOD_ was detected as punctate stains with no diffuse signals in contrast to what was seen in _PROTEIN_ protoplasts _PROTEIN_ rbcs nt _METHOD_ alone . furthermore these green punctate stains closely overlapped the red _METHOD_ of chlorophyll . to further verify protein import in the presence of co _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ western blotting was performed using proteins prepared from transformed _PROTEIN_ protoplasts . as shown in fig . rbcs nt _METHOD_ was detected _PROTEIN_ as the mature form with nearly undetectable levels of precursor indicating that the protein is efficiently imported into chloroplasts . we additionally examined the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ using an anti antibody . as shown in fig . the monoclonal anti antibody specifically detected a band at kda _PROTEIN_ in protoplasts transformed with rbcs nt _METHOD_ together with _PROTEIN_ but not in those transformed with rbcs nt _METHOD_ alone or non transformed protoplasts . the c terminal m domain is sufficient for protein import into chloroplasts in _PROTEIN_ next step was to identify the domain of _PROTEIN_ that is critical for protein import into chloroplasts . various deletion mutants were generated and tagged with at the n terminus . constructs were introduced into protoplasts along with rbcs nt _METHOD_ and import of the fusion protein into chloroplasts was examined by western blotting . the degree to which these mutants complemented the defect in the protein import was assessed by measuring the reduction in the precursor form . in control protoplasts transformed with the vector alone the precursor level was of the total rbcs nt _METHOD_ . in protoplasts _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ a or _PROTEIN_ the precursor form of rbcs nt _METHOD_ was nearly undetectable similar to that observed with full length _PROTEIN_ . in the presence of _PROTEIN_ g the amount of precursor protein was of the total rbcs nt _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ implying that the ability of this mutant to support protein import into chloroplasts was hampered but still functional . however in protoplasts _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ m the amount of precursor rbcs nt _METHOD_ was equivalent to that in protoplasts transformed with vector alone indicating that the m domain is most critical for protein import into chloroplasts . _PROTEIN_ of these mutant _PROTEIN_ proteins in _PROTEIN_ protoplasts was analyzed by western blotting using the anti antibody . the deletion mutants were present at nearly equal levels in the protein extracts prepared from transformed protoplasts confirming their _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ protoplasts . _PROTEIN_ a and _PROTEIN_ m were detected at the expected positions based on their calculated molecular weights whereas the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ g and _PROTEIN_ m bands were much larger than their expected sizes . _PROTEIN_ has previously been detected at kda instead of kda _PROTEIN_ . the migration patterns of these deletion mutants strongly suggest that the abnormal mobility of _PROTEIN_ is due to the a domain . to further define the domain necessary for protein import into chloroplasts we generated additional mutants _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ mutant underwent a amino acid deletion from the n terminal side of the m domain while _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ has a amino acid deletion from the c terminus of the m domain . the deletion mutants were introduced into _PROTEIN_ protoplasts together with rbcs nt _METHOD_ . protein extracts were prepared and rbcs nt _METHOD_ import was examined by western blot . as depicted in fig . b and c of rbcs nt _METHOD_ was detected as the precursor form upon co _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ and was detected as precursor when rbcs nt _METHOD_ was co _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . in the control protoplasts transformed with rbcs nt _METHOD_ alone of the rbcs nt _METHOD_ was in the precursor form . _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutant proteins was confirmed by western blotting using the anti antibody . our results strongly suggest that the intact m domain is necessary to support protein import into chloroplasts . the m domain alone is targeted to studies have shown that _PROTEIN_ is present in both _LOCATION_ associated and soluble _METHOD_ and that the g domain plays a critical role in the targeting of the protein to the outer envelope _LOCATION_ . however the _PROTEIN_ that the m domain is sufficient to support protein import into chloroplasts in _PROTEIN_ protoplasts raises the possibility that the isolated m domain may also be targeted to chloroplasts . thus we examined the localization of _PROTEIN_ and the m domain . we generated _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ by inserting the _METHOD_ coding region between the a and g domains the resulting construct was introduced into protoplasts of wild type plants . as shown in fig . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ localized to chloroplasts with a _PROTEIN_ pattern an indication of localization in the envelope _LOCATION_ . in addition the _METHOD_ signal was detected in the _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ as a diffuse pattern signifying that a part of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ is also present in the _LOCATION_ consistent with previous data . _METHOD_ alone gave a diffuse pattern . next we examined the targeting of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ to chloroplasts in _PROTEIN_ protoplasts . protoplasts were transformed with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ together with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ a fusion protein of the outer envelope _LOCATION_ protein _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ that is targeted to the outer envelope _LOCATION_ of chloroplasts . as shown in fig . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ again displayed a diffuse pattern together with a _PROTEIN_ pattern . the _PROTEIN_ pattern of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signal closely overlapped that of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signal . furthermore _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ signals surrounded the _METHOD_ signals of chlorophyll . these results collectively suggest that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ localizes to both the _LOCATION_ and to the undeveloped chloroplasts in _PROTEIN_ protoplasts . as a control we transformed _PROTEIN_ protoplasts with _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and examined the localization of these proteins . _METHOD_ on its own gave a diffuse pattern and did not overlap the red _METHOD_ signals of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . however as expected the red _METHOD_ signals of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ surrounded the _METHOD_ signals of chlorophyll . as another control for the localization of _PROTEIN_ to the chloroplast envelope _LOCATION_ we transformed _PROTEIN_ protoplasts with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ a mitochondrial marker generated by fusion of the transit peptide of mitochondrial _PROTEIN_ with _METHOD_ . as expected the red signals of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ gave a punctate staining pattern that did not overlap green signals of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ although the red punctate stains of the mitochondria were concentrated around the chloroplasts as often occurs in plant cells . to determine whether the _METHOD_ domain affects _PROTEIN_ activity we performed a complementation assay in _PROTEIN_ protoplasts using _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ supported the import of rbcs nt _METHOD_ as efficiently as _PROTEIN_ confirming that the _METHOD_ domain insertion into _PROTEIN_ does not affect the function of the protein . we then investigated the localization of the m domain using a form with a _METHOD_ tag at the n terminus . the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein was not targeted to chloroplasts but formed large aggregates for reasons that are unknown at present . we also examined the localization of the tagged m domain _PROTEIN_ by immunohistochemical analysis using the antibody . the green _METHOD_ of _PROTEIN_ was observed as a _PROTEIN_ pattern surrounding the red _METHOD_ of chlorophyll in _PROTEIN_ protoplasts suggesting that _PROTEIN_ is targeted to the envelope _LOCATION_ of chloroplasts . in control protoplasts transformed with vector alone no green signal was observed confirming the specificity of the anti antibody . to further establish the localization of _PROTEIN_ protein extracts prepared from _PROTEIN_ protoplasts co transformed with _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ were fractionated into _LOCATION_ and soluble fractions . co _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was used as a control for soluble proteins in the subcellular fractionation . as shown in fig . _PROTEIN_ was detected in the _LOCATION_ fraction but not the soluble fraction whereas _METHOD_ alone was present in the soluble fraction . the _PROTEIN_ domain is critical for protein import into next assessed the role of the _PROTEIN_ domain in protein import into chloroplasts . the g domain plays an essential role in the targeting of _PROTEIN_ to the outer _LOCATION_ of chloroplasts . mutations were introduced in the first and second _PROTEIN_ binding motifs to generate _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ respectively and were tagged with at the n terminus . the substitution of serine with asparagine _PROTEIN_ at the first _PROTEIN_ binding motif of _PROTEIN_ binding proteins produces a gdp bound form whereas the substitution of aspartic acid with leucine _PROTEIN_ at the second _PROTEIN_ binding motif generates a _PROTEIN_ defective mutant form . the mutants _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were introduced into _PROTEIN_ protoplasts along with rbcs nt _METHOD_ and targeting of rbcs nt _METHOD_ was examined . in the presence of both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ to of rbcs nt _METHOD_ was detected as the precursor form similar to that in control protoplasts . this result is in accordance to previous studies that showed that the g domain is critical for targeting of _PROTEIN_ to chloroplasts . however this result appeared to be in contrast to the above results showing that the m domain is targeted to the chloroplasts and is sufficient to complement the defect of protein import into chloroplasts in _PROTEIN_ protoplasts . one possible explanation is that the mutant g domains may have a dominant negative effect on _PROTEIN_ with respect to its targeting to chloroplasts . to confirm that these proteins are _PROTEIN_ in protoplasts protein extracts were prepared from protoplasts transformed with these mutants and analyzed by western blotting using the anti antibody . similar levels of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and wild type _PROTEIN_ were observed in protoplasts . to further investigate the failure of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ to support protein import into chloroplasts in _PROTEIN_ protoplasts we examined the localization of these mutants . again the _METHOD_ coding region was inserted between the a and g domains and the resulting constructs were introduced into wild type protoplasts . both _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were observed only as diffuse patterns in the _LOCATION_ . our data indicate that the g domain is critical for targeting to the outer envelope _LOCATION_ as observed previously . thus it is possible that the mutant g domain may mask the targeting signal present at the m domain which in turn results in failure to support protein import into chloroplasts . chloroplasts are well developed in transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ the m domain in _PROTEIN_ mutant confirm the results obtained with the transient _PROTEIN_ approach in _PROTEIN_ protoplasts we generated transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ various deletion mutants in a _PROTEIN_ background . the _PROTEIN_ mutant was _PROTEIN_ as heterozygotes since homozygotes are seedling lethal . transformation was performed using heterozygote plants at the _PROTEIN_ locus . heterozygotes were similar to wild types in appearance and were selected from a pool of seeds obtained from heterozygous plants based on wild type appearance and kanamycin resistance . transformants were selected using both kanamycin and hygromycin resistance since deletion mutants were introduced into plants together with the hygromycin resistance gene . we scored the phenotype and segregation of transgenic plants at the generation on plates containing both kanamycin and hygromycin . a summary of the segregation ratios from transgenic plants is shown in table i . as expected from transgenic plants transformed with the vector all the plants resistant to both kanamycin and hygromycin were nearly identical to _PROTEIN_ homozygotes . when _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ a were introduced into _PROTEIN_ heterozygotes most of plants resistant to both kanamycin and hygromycin were wild type plants indicating that these proteins complement the mutation . moreover _PROTEIN_ a transgenic plants were nearly identical to wild type plants suggesting that the a domain is dispensable . upon introduction of _PROTEIN_ g we observed yellowish and wild type plants but no albino plants among plants that were resistant to both kanamycin and hygromycin . the ratio of yellowish to wild type plants was nearly to suggesting that the yellow plants represent homozygous _PROTEIN_ plants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ g which weakly complements the loss of _PROTEIN_ . when we examined transgenic plants obtained with _PROTEIN_ m albino and wild type plants were observed as is the case in plants obtained with the vector alone . furthermore the segregation ratio of progeny was to indicating that _PROTEIN_ m does not complement the loss of _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ . among _PROTEIN_ transgenic plants that were resistant to both kanamycin and hygromycin greenish or wild type plants were observed . the ratio of greenish to wild type plants was to indicating that greenish plants are _PROTEIN_ homozygotes with _PROTEIN_ . this finding strongly suggests that _PROTEIN_ functionally complements the loss of _PROTEIN_ at a slightly reduced efficiency compared with wild type _PROTEIN_ . to further confirm the complementation we examined the genotypes of individual plants by polymerase chain reaction with specific primers . as a control pcr products obtained from homozygotes heterozygotes harboring a copy of _PROTEIN_ and wild type plants were compared . as expected _PROTEIN_ homozygote plants displayed no _PROTEIN_ band with and primers but produced a t dna specific band with lb and specific primers _PROTEIN_ . heterozygotes harboring _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ exhibited _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and t dna specific bands at kb kb and bp respectively . in contrast wild type plants displayed only the _PROTEIN_ band but no t dna band as expected . next we examined the genotypes of transgenic plants harboring the various _METHOD_ of _PROTEIN_ . we selected plants resistant to both hygromycin and kanamycin from transgenic lines harboring the various deletion constructs . as shown in fig . plants with a wild type appearance transformed with _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ a displayed both t dna specific and transgene specific bands but not the endogenous _PROTEIN_ band . kanamycin and hygromycin resistant albino plants obtained from transgenic plants transformed with _PROTEIN_ m also exhibited t dna and transgene specific bands but not the endogenous _PROTEIN_ band . finally yellowish and greenish plants also contained t dna specific and transgene specific bands but not the endogenous _PROTEIN_ band confirming that these phenotypes are a result of _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ g and _PROTEIN_ respectively in a homozygous _PROTEIN_ background . thus the various deletion mutants have different abilities to complement the loss of _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ plants specifically _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ a have the capacity for full complementation _PROTEIN_ m does not complement the loss of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ g provides only very weak complementation and _PROTEIN_ has the capacity for nearly full complementation . we examined the structures of ultra thin sections of leaf tissues using transmission electron microscopy . we observed that albino plants obtained from transgenic lines harboring the vector alone had undeveloped chloroplasts with numerous lipid bodies but no _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ in accordance with previous data . however as expected from the phenotype chloroplasts in transgenic plants harboring _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ a were fully developed with numerous stacks of _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . in contrast chloroplasts in transgenic plants harboring _PROTEIN_ g were not fully developed and contained only a few strands of _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . in transgenic plants harboring _PROTEIN_ m chloroplast morphology was similar to that observed in _PROTEIN_ plants . in transgenic plants with _PROTEIN_ chloroplasts were well developed as judged by density of _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ which were similar to those in transgenic plants with _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ a . however careful analyses revealed that the density of _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ was slightly lower in transgenic plants with _PROTEIN_ than in those with _PROTEIN_ . these results confirm the phenotypic results in whole plants . to obtain independent evidence of the degree of complementation by the deletion mutants of _PROTEIN_ we measured the chlorophyll content as a marker for complementation . _PROTEIN_ plants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ a displayed nearly identical chlorophyll content . transgenic plants with _PROTEIN_ m were nearly identical to _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ to chlorophyll content . transgenic plants with _PROTEIN_ g and _PROTEIN_ displayed and of the chlorophyll content observed in wild type plants respectively . these results are in agreement with the data obtained from the experiments described above . next we performed western blotting with protein extracts obtained from transgenic plants using an anti antibody to confirm the _PROTEIN_ of the various _METHOD_ of _PROTEIN_ in transgenic plants . similar levels of protein were _PROTEIN_ by the deletion mutants and wild type _PROTEIN_ . finally we examined the localization of _PROTEIN_ with immunohistochemistry using a monoclonal anti antibody with a view to elucidating the mechanism of complementation by the _PROTEIN_ mutant . as depicted in fig . _PROTEIN_ was detected as a _PROTEIN_ pattern around chloroplasts indicating that it is targeted to chloroplasts . in contrast no signal was detected from wild type plants confirming the specificity of the anti antibody . to confirm the presence of _PROTEIN_ at the envelope _LOCATION_ protein extracts obtained from transgenic plants with _PROTEIN_ were fractionated into _LOCATION_ and soluble fractions by ultracentrifugation . the presence of _PROTEIN_ in these fractions was determined by western blot analysis with the anti antibody . _PROTEIN_ was detected in the _LOCATION_ but not the soluble fraction . as a control we also used an anti rbc antibody and found that rbcs is specifically detected in the soluble fraction .
growth of were grown on plates in a growth chamber . leaf tissues were harvested from plants and immediately employed for protoplast isolation . arabidopsis mutant seeds _PROTEIN_ that have a tdna insertion at the _PROTEIN_ gene were planted on kanamycin plants that were kanamycin resistant and had a wild type appearance were transferred to soil to set seeds . _PROTEIN_ homozygote plants have an albino phenotype and do not develop beyond the seedling stage with a few true leaves indicating that _PROTEIN_ plants are seedling lethal . however heterozygote plants _PROTEIN_ are normal and develop into mature plants that set seeds . thus the mutants were _PROTEIN_ as heterozygotes _PROTEIN_ . homozygous _PROTEIN_ mutants _PROTEIN_ were selected from pools of plants on plates based on the albino phenotype and used for preparation of protoplasts . construction of cdna encoding _PROTEIN_ was isolated from a library by pcr using the primers _PROTEIN_ and tcccccgggttagtacatgctgtacttgtcg . to generate _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ a _PROTEIN_ g attoc m _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ attoc and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ pcr amplification was performed using _PROTEIN_ as template and the following primers _PROTEIN_ ggtatggactcaaagtcggttact and tcccccgggttagtacatgctgtacttgtcg for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and tcccccgggttagtacatgctgtacttgtcg _PROTEIN_ a gcagcagctccacgtgcagttagatccccgcctctc gagaggcggggatctaactgcacgtggagctgctgc for _PROTEIN_ g _PROTEIN_ and tcccccgggttatcggaaaccaaatactttacgatgg _PROTEIN_ m _PROTEIN_ and tcccccgggttagtacatgctgtacttgtcg cgtacacgtggaatggtgagcaagggcgag and cgtacacgtgccttgtacagctcgtccatg for _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ ggggtgggaaaaaatgctactataaattcc and ggaatttatagtagcattttttcccacccc for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and cttcaaacccggagtcaaaataaaggtaatcttgac for _PROTEIN_ cgtaaagtatttggtttccgattcgaggagtatgattaccg and cggtaatcatactcctcgaatcggaaaccaaatactttacg for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and tcccccgggttactgatccgagctgctggttc for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . all pcr products were confirmed by nucleotide sequencing and placed into a puc based _PROTEIN_ vector with the camv promoter and nos terminator . generation of transgenic plants and analysis by arabidopsis plants _PROTEIN_ various _METHOD_ of tagged _PROTEIN_ were generated using a binary _PROTEIN_ vector with a hygromycin resistance gene and the floral dip method . transgenic plants resistant to both kanamycin and hygromycin were screened as described previously . from individual transgenic plants selected on plates containing both kanamycin and hygromycin two rosette leaves were harvested and used to isolate genomic dna . pcr was performed with primers designed to amplify the transgenes . the following primers were used gaaagagtctcagtagcaaagc and ttagtacatgctgtacttgtcg for endogenous _PROTEIN_ gaaagagtctcagtagcaaagc and _PROTEIN_ for the t dna insert _PROTEIN_ and ttagtacatgctgtacttgtcg for transgenes of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ a _PROTEIN_ g and attoc and _PROTEIN_ and tcggaaaccaaatactttacgatgg for _PROTEIN_ m. leaves were harvested from the same individual plants for ultrastructural analyses . ultrastructural obtain a detailed structure of chloroplast morphology leaf tissues were fixed for h with paraformaldehyde and glutaraldehyde in cacodylate buffer rinsed with the same buffer and postfixed with osmium tetroxide in a cacodylate buffer for h. after dehydration specimens were embedded in london resin white . ultra thin sections _PROTEIN_ were collected on uncoated nickel grids stained with uranyl acetate and examined using a transmission electron microscope at kv . protein fractionation and gel blot extracts were prepared as described previously . whole cell extracts were subjected to low speed centrifugation at for min to eliminate cellular debris . the low speed supernatant was further fractionated by ultracentrifugation at g for h. whole cell extracts or fractions were assayed by western blotting using anti _METHOD_ and anti antibodies . rbcs was detected with a polyclonal anti rbc antibody . transient _PROTEIN_ and in vivo targeting of reporter plasmids were introduced by peg mediated transformation into arabidopsis protoplasts prepared from leaf tissues . _PROTEIN_ of fusion constructs was monitored at various times after transformation and images were captured with a cooled ccd camera and a zeiss axioplan _METHOD_ microscope . immunohistochemistry transformed protoplasts were prepared as described previously . fixed cells were incubated with a mouse monoclonal anti antibody at overnight and washed three times with _PROTEIN_ buffer . subsequently the cells were incubated with a fluorescein isothiocyanate conjugated anti mouse igg secondary antibody . images were captured as described above .
