salt stress and abscisic acid induce accumulation of reactive oxygen species in plant cells . ros not only act as second messengers for the activation of salt stress responses but also have deleterious effects on plant growth due to their cytotoxicity . therefore the timing and degree of activation of ros producing or ros scavenging enzymes must be tightly regulated under salt stress conditions . we identified a novel locus of arabidopsis designated _PROTEIN_ whose disruption leads to increased salt stress tolerance in vegetative tissues . _PROTEIN_ encodes a transmembrane protein with an ankyrin repeat motif that has been implicated in diverse cellular processes such as signal transduction . comparative microarray analysis between wild type and the _PROTEIN_ mutant revealed that induction of genes encoding the ros producing nadph oxidases _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ under salt stress conditions was suppressed in the mutant . this suppression was accompanied by a corresponding reduction in ros accumulation . the aba induced _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ was also suppressed in the mutant as was the case for _PROTEIN_ an aba inducible marker gene . however the aba induced _PROTEIN_ of another marker gene _PROTEIN_ was not impaired in the mutant . these results suggest that the _PROTEIN_ mutation partially impairs aba signaling pathways possibly leading to the reduction in ros accumulation under salt stress conditions . we discuss the possible _METHOD_ underlying the salt tolerant phenotype of the _PROTEIN_ mutant .
it has been reported that altered levels of fatty acid desaturation in _LOCATION_ lipids caused by overexpression of desaturase genes result in increased tolerance of plants to osmotic stress . to determine whether the levels of desaturation in _LOCATION_ lipids affect the tolerance of arabidopsis to salt stress we compared salt stress tolerance levels in wild type plants with those in a mutant line which contains a nonsense mutation in the _PROTEIN_ gene encoding an fatty acid desaturase . the line survived for days on medium containing mm nacl although almost all the wild type plants died under the same conditions . as shown in figure nacl treatment _PROTEIN_ the fresh weights of shoots in wild type plants but this treatment did not markedly affect the fresh weights of shoots in the line . a similar result was also obtained when tissue damage was monitored in leaves by ion leakage an indicator of _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ damage after days of incubation on medium containing mm nacl . thus the line is more tolerant to salt stress than wild type plants . to confirm whether disruption of the _PROTEIN_ gene was responsible for this increased tolerance to salt stress we isolated a t dna insertion allele of _PROTEIN_ and examined its tolerance to salt stress . unexpectedly however there were no obvious differences in the extent of tolerance to salt stress between the t dna insertion line and the wild type plants . additionally the wild type _PROTEIN_ gene did not complement the salt tolerant phenotype of the line . these results suggested that the increased tolerance to salt stress in the line was not due to the _PROTEIN_ mutation . the salt tolerant phenotype has now been separated from the _PROTEIN_ locus by genetic recombination suggesting that the line carries at least two mutations one in the _PROTEIN_ gene and a second mutation in an unidentified gene involved in salt sensitivity . we have designated this gene as _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ phenotype segregated as a single recessive mendelian trait when crossed with col _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . as shown in figure genetic mapping revealed that the _PROTEIN_ locus is located in a kb region on chromosome . by genomic dna sequencing of this region we found a single point mutation in the open reading frame of the _GENE_ gene . to confirm that this mutation was responsible for the salt tolerant phenotype of the line we introduced the wild type _GENE_ gene into the line by agrobacterium tumefaciens mediated transformation . _PROTEIN_ of the wild type _GENE_ gene complemented the salt tolerant phenotype of the line suggesting that _GENE_ is the wild type _PROTEIN_ gene . to further confirm that the salt tolerant phenotype of is not dependent on the _PROTEIN_ mutation we examined salt tolerance in two lines of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ t. the _PROTEIN_ homozygous line was selected from progeny resulting from crosses between and wild type plants and does not contain the _PROTEIN_ mutation . the _PROTEIN_ t homozygous line is an arabidopsis t dna insertional mutant that contains an insertion in the second exon of _PROTEIN_ . both lines showed lower proportions of damaged seedlings under salt stress conditions compared with wild type plants . this result strongly supports the conclusion that disruption of _PROTEIN_ causes increased tolerance to salt stress . in further experiments we used the _PROTEIN_ single mutant line to investigate the physiological role of _PROTEIN_ because this line exhibits a more severe phenotype than the _PROTEIN_ t line . in rt pcr experiments using primers that amplify sequences downstream of the t dna insertion site _PROTEIN_ transcript was detected in the _PROTEIN_ t line . it might be therefore possible that a truncated version of the _PROTEIN_ protein with a deletion at the n terminus may be produced and partially functional in this line . the _PROTEIN_ gene consists of bp between the start and stop codons . it is organized into four exons and three introns . the _PROTEIN_ mutation occurs in the third exon . genomic dna sequencing revealed that the _PROTEIN_ mutation changed a glutamine codon into a stop codon . _PROTEIN_ encodes a novel protein containing ankyrin repeats and putative transmembrane regions . the deduced _PROTEIN_ protein consists of amino acids with a predicted molecular _METHOD_ of da and a predicted pi of . the n terminal region does not match any peptides with known functions . the middle part contains seven ankyrin repeats based on the smart protein domain prediction program . the c terminal region contains four predicted transmembrane helices . a database search using the deduced amino acid sequence of _PROTEIN_ identified cdna clones from lotus japonicus and oryza sativa which encode proteins highly homologous to _PROTEIN_ . their deduced amino acid sequences show and identity respectively with _PROTEIN_ . it was previously reported that the protein is essential for nitrogen fixing symbiosis between l. japonicus and rhizobium bacteria . however the exact biochemical functions of these proteins are yet to be characterized . to investigate the _PROTEIN_ pattern of _PROTEIN_ we performed rt pcr using rna extracted from various organs . although _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ in all organs examined higher _PROTEIN_ of this gene was observed in green tissues than in roots and flowers as previously reported . this is consistent with our results indicating that the salt tolerant phenotype of the _PROTEIN_ mutant is observed _PROTEIN_ in shoots . to further examine its _PROTEIN_ in various tissues we used the gus reporter gene . a kb upstream sequence from _PROTEIN_ was ligated with the gus reporter gene and the resulting _PROTEIN_ promoter gus construct was introduced into wild type plants . a histochemical analysis of the transgenic plants revealed that gus activity was highest in vascular tissues suggesting that _PROTEIN_ might be _PROTEIN_ most highly in these tissues . to investigate the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ a construct was produced in which _PROTEIN_ was fused to _METHOD_ . the construct was transiently _PROTEIN_ in living onion epidermal cells which were then subjected to analysis by confocal laser scanning microscopy . although the targetp program made no prediction _PROTEIN_ the most likely location of _PROTEIN_ the _METHOD_ image showed a clear localization of _METHOD_ to the cell periphery . for this experiment we used both intact and plasmolyzed onion epidermal cells which allowed us to differentiate between localization within the cell wall and within the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . our results indicate that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ is localized to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . to analyze the effect of salt stress on _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ levels of the _PROTEIN_ transcript were evaluated in shoots and roots of arabidopsis exposed to high salt conditions for various periods of time . northern blots revealed that the _PROTEIN_ transcript was present in shoots under normal conditions but the amount of the transcript increased after exposure of plants to salt stress . a salt induced accumulation of _PROTEIN_ transcript was also detected in roots by rt pcr analysis . we also analyzed the effects of other abiotic stresses and aba on _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . as shown in figures and accumulation of _PROTEIN_ transcripts was induced by drought but not by cold osmotic stress or aba . salt stress causes both hyper ionic and hyper osmotic stresses . to determine whether the salt tolerant phenotype of the _PROTEIN_ mutant results from an ionic effect an osmotic effect or both we examined the development of chlorosis in mutant and wild type plants on media containing various salts or non ionic osmotic reagent . on the media containing mm nacl or mm development of chlorosis in leaves was delayed in the _PROTEIN_ mutant compared with the wild type plants . by contrast on the media containing mm kcl or mm mannitol there was no obvious difference in the timing of chlorosis development between the mutant and wild type plants . these results suggested that the _PROTEIN_ mutation might affect tolerance to ionic stress especially na stress rather than to non ionic osmotic stress . results consistent with these were obtained when ion leakage was measured from leaves of mutant and wild type plants under various stress conditions . in most cases the measurements were performed day before the appearance of visible chlorosis in the wild type plants . however the data for plants under osmotic stress were obtained after the appearance of chlorosis because we could not measure ion leakage from the leaves of these plants at an earlier time . seven day old seedlings were treated with nacl kcl or mannitol . data are means _PROTEIN_ . we also analyzed the drought tolerance of the _PROTEIN_ mutant by measuring the rate of water loss from leaves under drought stress conditions . we found no obvious differences in sensitivity to drought stress between this mutant and wild type plants . these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ functions in the responses of plants to na stress . we found that _PROTEIN_ was highly _PROTEIN_ in vascular tissues . it has been proposed that vascular tissue is an important site for proline catabolism aba biosynthesis and na transport . proline and aba are known to play roles in _PROTEIN_ of plants to salt stress . _PROTEIN_ of na and k homeostasis is also thought to be crucial under salt stress conditions . this raises the possibility that the increased tolerance to salt stress in the _PROTEIN_ mutant might be due to changes in levels of these cellular components . we quantified the levels of aba proline na and k in nacl treated or mock treated vegetative tissues of mutant and wild type plants . there were no obvious differences between the mutant and the wild type plants with respect to the levels of these cellular components . therefore the salt tolerant phenotype of the _PROTEIN_ mutant can not be explained by alterations in proline catabolism aba biosynthesis or cation uptake . seven day old seedlings were treated with mm nacl for day or mock treated . data are means _PROTEIN_ . fw fresh weight . dw dry weight . to explore the biological role of _PROTEIN_ a microarray experiment was performed using rna from nacl treated or mock treated vegetative tissues of _PROTEIN_ mutant and wild type plants . the genes represented on the _PROTEIN_ arrays were assigned to functional categories using unbiased gene ontology statistical analysis . we focused our analysis on molecular function annotations and go _METHOD_ represented by at least two genes from our data set . for each of these go _METHOD_ the ratios of the transcript signals from the _PROTEIN_ and wild type plants were determined and averaged . no category was found to be _PROTEIN_ at a level at least twofold higher or lower in the _PROTEIN_ mutants than the wild type plants under normal growth conditions . on the other hand under salt stress conditions genes in five categories were found to be up or downregulated by at least twofold in the _PROTEIN_ mutants compared with the wild type plants with significance at p < . the category abscisic acid hydroxylase activity contains genes involved in abscisic acid catabolic processes and these genes were _PROTEIN_ at levels that were fold lower in the _PROTEIN_ mutants than in the wild type plants . however because the aba content of the _PROTEIN_ mutants was not considerably different from that of the wild type plants the reduction in _PROTEIN_ levels in this category is probably not responsible for the salt tolerant phenotype of the _PROTEIN_ mutant . three categories phosphoric ester hydrolase activity oxygen evolving activity and protochlorophyllide reductase activity contain genes involved in photosynthesis and these genes showed mean _PROTEIN_ levels that were at least twofold higher in the _PROTEIN_ mutants than in the wild type plants . it has been proposed that the _PROTEIN_ of many photosynthesis related genes is down regulated under salt stress conditions . the higher _PROTEIN_ of genes in these categories in the _PROTEIN_ mutant may result from increased tolerance to salt stress . the category nad h oxidase activity contains genes encoding enzymes involved in the generation of ros and the mean _PROTEIN_ level of genes in this category was fold lower in the _PROTEIN_ mutants than in the wild type plants . furthermore the _PROTEIN_ levels of many genes known to be induced by ros were suppressed in the _PROTEIN_ mutants compared with the wild type seedlings as shown in table . salt stress is known to cause accumulation of ros which are highly toxic . therefore the reduced _PROTEIN_ levels of nadph oxidase genes may be responsible for the salt tolerant phenotype of the _PROTEIN_ mutant . to verify a subset of the microarray data the _PROTEIN_ of three nadph oxidase genes _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ was evaluated in mutant and wild type plants by rt pcr . the _PROTEIN_ of these genes was induced in response to salt stress in the wild type plants . in agreement with the microarray data the salt responsive induction of these genes was markedly suppressed in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . to confirm that suppression of the nadph oxidase genes affected ros levels in the _PROTEIN_ mutant the accumulation of was measured in situ by precipitation of polymerized diaminobenzidine . an intense brown precipitate was observed in wild type plants after exposure for days to mm nacl indicating high levels of . the dab staining intensity was greatly reduced in the _PROTEIN_ mutant compared with the wild type plants . these results suggest that the _PROTEIN_ mutation may somehow suppress induction of the nadph oxidase genes in response to salt stress resulting in lower levels of and this may be the cause of the salt tolerant phenotype . however salt stress induction of these genes is not completely abolished in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . it is known that _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ is induced by aba . to investigate whether the _PROTEIN_ mutation affects the induction of the nadph oxidase genes by aba the _PROTEIN_ levels of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were evaluated in the mutant and the wild type plants by rt pcr . aba treatment strongly induced _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in the wild type plants . we did not detect aba induction of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in the wild type plants even though this gene was previously shown to be aba inducible . in the _PROTEIN_ mutant induction of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in response to aba treatment was suppressed . the _PROTEIN_ levels of two other aba inducible genes _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were also evaluated . interestingly _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ was induced in response to aba treatment in the _PROTEIN_ mutant at similar levels to those in the wild type plants however _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ was not induced in this mutant . these results suggest that the _PROTEIN_ mutation inhibits a branch of the aba signal transduction pathway regulating the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . we also investigated the _PROTEIN_ levels of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in the _PROTEIN_ mutant and wild type plants under ozone drought and osmotic stress conditions . it is known that _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ is induced by ozone and that drought and osmotic stress activate the aba signal transduction pathway . there were no obvious differences in the induction of these genes between the _PROTEIN_ mutant and wild type plants after these stress treatments . this result is consistent with the idea that the mutant phenotype is specific for salt stress . aba mediates various physiological processes in plants such as stomatal closure and inhibition of seed germination . to investigate whether _PROTEIN_ is involved in these aba mediated responses we measured stomatal apertures and seed germination rates of mutant and wild type plants in the presence of exogenous aba . after aba treatment stomatal pores closed to in the _PROTEIN_ mutant and in the wild type plants _PROTEIN_ suggesting that the _PROTEIN_ mutant is not aba insensitive . as shown in figure the _PROTEIN_ seeds germinated at a similar rate to that of wild type seeds on plates containing aba . these results suggest that the _PROTEIN_ mutant responds normally to aba during stomatal closure and seed germination .
