type ii nad dehydrogenases are located on the inner mitochondrial _LOCATION_ of plants fungi protists and some primitive animals . however recent observations have been made which identify several arabidopsis type ii dehydrogenases as dual targeted proteins . targeting either mitochondria and _LOCATION_ or mitochondria and chloroplasts . members of the nd protein family were identified in various plant species . phylogenetic analyses and subcellular targeting predictions were carried out for all proteins . all nd proteins from three model plant species arabidopsis rice and physcomitrella were cloned as n and c terminal _METHOD_ fusions and subcellular localisations were determined . dual targeting of plant type ii dehydrogenases was observed to have evolved early in plant evolution and to be widespread throughout different plant species . in all three species tested dual targeting to both mitochondria and _LOCATION_ was found for at least one nda and ndb type protein . in addition two ndb type proteins from physcomitrella were also found to target chloroplasts . the dual targeting of ndc type proteins was found to have evolved _PROTEIN_ in plant evolution . the functions of type ii dehydrogenases within plant cells will have to be re evaluated in light of this newly identified subcellular targeting information .
previously we had determined that a number of nd proteins from arabidopsis thaliana are dual targeted to several locations including mitochondria and _LOCATION_ or mitochondria and _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ . to gain a better understanding of how widespread this dual targeting ability is we identified all the nd type proteins from a number of plant species utilised various subcellular prediction _METHOD_ for each ortholog and identified any peroxisomal type targeting sequences _PROTEIN_ according to several prediction _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and the araperox database . phylogenetic analysis showed that all nd orthologs are clustered into three distinct clades . types a b and c . it was found that a type nd proteins are predominantly predicted to be targeted to the mitochondria and is consistent with the previous data from arabidopsis in which both _PROTEIN_ and have cleavable mitochondrial n terminal targeting signals _PROTEIN_ . however it was interesting that at least one nda ortholog from each higher plant species appears to have a _PROTEIN_ signal at their c terminus . none of the prediction _METHOD_ used predicted peroxisomal targeting for any of the nda proteins from physcomitrella or chlamydomonas . phylogenetic and subcellular predictions of plant nad h dehydrogenases . phylogenetic tree of nad h dehydrogenases from vovox carteri chlamydomonas reinhardtii physcomitrella patens selaginella moellendorffii oryza sativa zea mays vitis vinifera arabidopsis thaliana glycine max picea glauca and populus trichocarpa . the sequences of the saccharomyces cerevisiae nad h dehydrogenases are included as well as nadh dehydrogenases from synechocystis sp . pcc and escherichia coli . the predicted and experimental localizations of each protein are indicated by the coloured boxes . orange mitochondrial green _LOCATION_ blue peroxisomal and black no prediction . shown also are the last amino acids _PROTEIN_ putative peroxisomal targeting signals _PROTEIN_ are coloured depending on the strength as determined by the araperox database _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . the known experimental loactions for arabidopsis thaliana nd proteins were taken from _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ for chlamydomonas reinhardtii _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ from and for saccharomyces cerevisiae and from . the phylogenetic tree was constructed using the neighboring joining method . numbers at each node are the percentage bootstrap values of replicates . the scale bar indicates the number of amino acid substitutions at each site . amongst the ndb type proteins prediction of mitochondrial targeting was less frequent . this may be due to the _PROTEIN_ that ndb proteins do not contain a cleavable n terminus mitochondrial targeting signal which is the basis of the prediction _METHOD_ used _PROTEIN_ . however the majority of ndb proteins ranging from physcomitrella to poplar also contain predicted _PROTEIN_ sequences . it is interesting to note that the predicted _PROTEIN_ sequences in both nda and ndb proteins are not conserved in all species . in _PROTEIN_ in different species the _PROTEIN_ sequence is completely different in _METHOD_ of the amino acids making up the last c terminal tripeptide however the properties remain the same . this suggests that the c terminal regions of nda and ndb proteins is not crucial for catalytic function . the ndc type proteins so named for their similarity to a cyanobacterial nadh dehydrogenase and are mostly predicted to be targeted to _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ . no _PROTEIN_ sequences were predicted . this is consistent with the localisation of arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ which is predicted to be _LOCATION_ but has been experimentally shown to be targeted to both mitochondria and _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . it has previously been shown that both nda proteins from arabidopsis are dual targeted to mitochondria and _LOCATION_ by both _METHOD_ tagging and western blot analysis _PROTEIN_ . to demonstrate the _METHOD_ patterns expected by a dual targeted protein containing an n terminal mitochondrial targeting signal and a c terminal _PROTEIN_ sequence we have included the arabidopsis proteins in our analysis of the rice and physcomitrella nda orthologs . when _METHOD_ is placed at the c terminus of both and the chimeric protein is targeted to mitochondria in both arabidopsis cell suspension and onion epidermal cells as visualized by the overlap of the _METHOD_ with the _METHOD_ signals from the mitochondrial controls . in most instances the _METHOD_ signal shows a halo like shape around the mitochondria . this has been speculated to result when the _METHOD_ is not completely pulled into the mitochondria and has previously been observed with atnda and atndb proteins _PROTEIN_ and is also observed with the _METHOD_ tagging of mitochondrial outer _LOCATION_ proteins . however in this case as nda proteins are known to be located in the inner _LOCATION_ it is possible that the c terminus of nda proteins are located in the intermembrane space _METHOD_ and may produce a similar result . in contrast to the full length c terminal fusions truncation of both and to just the final amino acids fused to the c terminus of _METHOD_ was found to target solely to the _LOCATION_ . this co localization was observed in both tissue types tested . subcellular localizations of arabidopsis and rice nda type proteins . _METHOD_ was fused to the c terminus of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ from arabidopsis thaliana and _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ from oryza sativa . additionally the last amino acids were fused to the c terminus of _METHOD_ . subcellular targeting was analyzed in both arabidopsis cell suspension or onion epidermal tissue along with _METHOD_ tagged mitochondrial or peroxisomal controls . the protein accession number the location of _METHOD_ and the number of amino acids used are shown for each construct . mitochondria and _LOCATION_ are indicated . m _METHOD_ mitochondrial _METHOD_ px _METHOD_ peroxisomal _METHOD_ . scale bar indicates . when both nda proteins from rice were analysed in the same manner slightly different results were obtained . was observed to target to mitochondria when _METHOD_ was fused to its c terminus however when the last amino acids are fused to the c terminus of _METHOD_ no targeting was observed to any distinct organelle consistent with the _PROTEIN_ that does not contain a predicted _PROTEIN_ signal . when the targeting of was tested it was seen to target to both mitochondria and _LOCATION_ in both the tissues tested . therefore at least one of the rice nda proteins displays dual targeting ability . to determine if dual targeting ability is also evident with physcomitrella _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ the same set of experiments were performed . in both onion epidermal cells and arabidopsis cell suspension both physcomitrella nda proteins displayed dual targeting ability to both mitochondria and _LOCATION_ as with and . however based on the bioinfomatic analysis the targeting of and to _LOCATION_ is surprising as they do not contain any _PROTEIN_ signal nor are they predicted to be peroxisomal . to test whether this peroxisomal targeting is an artifact we _PROTEIN_ the physcomitrella nda fusions in physcomitrella tissue thereby eliminating any incorrect targeting arising from cross species interference . again both and were dual targeted to mitochondria and _LOCATION_ suggesting that the dual targeting of nda type proteins arose early in land plant evolution . subcellular localizations of physcomitrella nda type proteins . _METHOD_ was fused to the c terminus of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ from physcomitrella patens . additionally the last amino acids were fused at the c terminus of _METHOD_ . subcellular targeting was analyzed in both arabidopsis cell suspension onion epidermal tissue and physcomitrella protonemal tissue along with _METHOD_ tagged mitochondrial or peroxisomal controls . the protein accession number the location of _METHOD_ and the number of amino acids used are shown for each construct . mitochondria and _LOCATION_ are indicated . m _METHOD_ mitochondrial _METHOD_ px _METHOD_ peroxisomal _METHOD_ . scale bar indicates . the three arabidopsis ndb proteins have previously been determined to be mitochondrial _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ which was confirmed in this study . however the last amino acids of fused to the c terminus of _METHOD_ targeted to _LOCATION_ whilst the last amino acids of and did not target _METHOD_ to any distinct organelle and appeared _LOCATION_ indicative of no targeting . this _METHOD_ that is dual targeted to both mitochondria and _LOCATION_ and that and can only be targeted to mitochondria . to determine if dual targeting of ndb proteins also occurs in rice the two rice orthologs were also analysed . both and were observed to target _METHOD_ to mitochondria and the last amino acids can target _METHOD_ to _LOCATION_ in all the tissues tested . this suggests that the dual targeting of ndb proteins is conserved in rice and arabidopsis . subcellular localizations of arabidopsis and rice ndb type proteins . _METHOD_ was fused to the c terminus of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ from arabidopsis thaliana and _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ from oryza sativa . additionally the last amino acids were fused at the c terminus of _METHOD_ . subcellular targeting was analyzed in both arabidopsis cell suspension or onion epidermal tissue along with _METHOD_ tagged mitochondrial or peroxisomal controls . the protein accession number the location of _METHOD_ and the number of amino acids used are shown for each construct . mitochondria and _LOCATION_ are indicated . m _METHOD_ mitochondrial _METHOD_ px _METHOD_ peroxisomal _METHOD_ . scale bar indicates . unlike rice and arabidopsis physcomitrella contains three ndb homologs and when _METHOD_ was fused to their c termini _METHOD_ was targeted to the mitochondria with a distinctive halo like _METHOD_ in arabidopsis cell suspensions . however when these same constructs were _PROTEIN_ in onion epidermal cells a very different picture emerged for and . not only were and targeted to mitochondria but they could also target _METHOD_ to _LOCATION_ . for only mitochondrial targeting was observed . when the last amino acids of and were fused to the c terminus of _METHOD_ both and could target _METHOD_ to _LOCATION_ and showed targeting of _METHOD_ to the _LOCATION_ . the _METHOD_ assays were repeated with physcomitrella tissue and as seen in the onion epidermal cells and arabidopsis cell suspensions both and were able to target _METHOD_ to mitochondria _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ . was only observed to target _METHOD_ to mitochondria even in a homologous system . the lack of peroxisomal targeting by the c termini of is not surprising as no _PROTEIN_ sequence is predicted . however the targeting of and to _LOCATION_ was unexpected . however they are closely related to the chlamydomonas _PROTEIN_ protein which has been demonstrated to be a solely _LOCATION_ protein . notably physcomitrella ndb proteins are also considerably longer at the n terminus compared to arabidopsis suggesting additional targeting information and as the ambiguous targeting predictor _PROTEIN_ predicts both and to be dual targeted . subcellular localizations of physcomitrella ndb type proteins . _METHOD_ was fused to the c terminus of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ from physcomitrella patens . additionally the last amino acids were fused at the c terminus of _METHOD_ .

each construct . mitochondria _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ are indicated . m _METHOD_ mitochondrial _METHOD_ px _METHOD_ peroxisomal _METHOD_ pl _METHOD_ platid _METHOD_ . scale bar indicates . phylogenetic analysis showed that among the three clades made up of nda ndb and ndc proteins ndc is the most ancestral group and branched out early in evolution . with _PROTEIN_ to the targeting ability of ndc proteins only one ortholog was found in arabidopsis rice and physcomitrella . when arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ was fused to _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ two different patterns emerged . in arabidopsis cell suspensions a clear _LOCATION_ localization could be observed however in onion epidermal cells clear targeting to both mitochondria and _LOCATION_ was observed . as was previously shown to be imported into isolated arabidopsis mitochondria _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ it can be concluded that is dual targeted to mitochondria and _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . subcellular localizations of physcomitrella ndc type proteins . _METHOD_ was fused to the c terminus of the ndc type proteins from arabidopsis thaliana oryza sativa and physcomitrella patens . subcellular targeting was analyzed in arabidopsis cell suspension onion epidermal tissues and for the physcomitrella _PROTEIN_ also in physcomitrella protenemal tissue along with _METHOD_ tagged mitochondrial or _LOCATION_ controls the protein accession number the position of _METHOD_ and the number of amino acids used are shown for each construct . mitochondria and _LOCATION_ are indicated . m _METHOD_ mitochondrial _METHOD_ pl _METHOD_ _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ . scale bar indicates . to determine when dual targeting of _PROTEIN_ arose we analysed the targeting ability of rice and physcomitrella . for we see a similar pattern as with in that _LOCATION_ targeting was observed in arabidopsis cell suspensions and dual targeted to mitochondria and _LOCATION_ in onion epidermal cells . for only _LOCATION_ targeting was observed in both arabidopsis suspension and onion epidermal cells . _METHOD_ tagging of in physcomitrella tissue resulted in only _LOCATION_ targeting . these results suggest that in lower plants such as physcomitrella _PROTEIN_ proteins are only targeted to _LOCATION_ and in higher plants such as arabidopsis and rice _PROTEIN_ has additionally acquired targeting to mitochondria during plant evolution .
protein sequences for all arabidopsis type ii nad h dehydrogenase proteins were obtained from the tair website _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and used in blastp searches against volvox carteri chlamydomonas reinhardtii physcomitrella patens selaginella moellendorffii oryza sativa zea mays vitis vinifera glycine max and populus trichocarpa protein databases using the phytozome website . blastx searches were used in order to identify proteins from picea glauca on the ncbi database . the known sequences for the escherichia coli saccharomyces cerevisiae and synechocystis sp . pcc nadh dehydrogenases were downloaded from the ncbi website . predictions of subcellular localizations were carried out using predotar targetp and _METHOD_ . the _PROTEIN_ predictor was also utilized to predict the probability of a given protein to be dual targeted to mitochondria and _LOCATION_ . peroxisomal targeting was predicted using the _PROTEIN_ predictor _PROTEIN_ and by comparing the last c terminal amino acids with the known _PROTEIN_ sequences from the araperox database . phylogenetic analysis was carried out by first creating a multiple sequence alignment of all proteins using mafft . the phylogenetic tree was calculated using mega using statistical method of neighboring joining with the number of bootstrap replications of . rna extraction from arabidopsis thaliana oryza sativa and physcomitrella patens was carried out using the rneasy kit according to manufacturer s instructions . reverse transcription was carried out using iii first strand synthesis system . for some genes cdna clones were obtained from the knowledge based oryza molecular biological encyclopedia _PROTEIN_ or the _PROTEIN_ bioresource center . cdna or cdna clones were used as templates to amplify full length cdnas or the last c terminal amino acids prior to the stop codon for cloning into n and c terminal _METHOD_ vectors _PROTEIN_ using recombinant gateway technology . the targeting signals of the pisum sativum small subunit of ribulose bisphosphate _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and cucubita sp . malate synthase were fused to _METHOD_ and used as a _LOCATION_ and peroxisomal markers respectively . for mitochondrial controls three different constructs were utilised . for arabidopsis suspension cells the targeting signal of the glycine max alternative oxidase _PROTEIN_ was used . for onion cells the cytochrome c oxidase iv targeting signal from saccharomyces cerevisiae fused to mcherry was utilised _PROTEIN_ . finally the full length coding sequence from the physcomitrella alternative oxidase fused to mcherry was used in physcomitrella tissue . biolistic co transformation of _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ fusion vectors was performed on arabidopsis cell suspensions and onion epidermal cells as previously described . briefly of each _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ plasmid were co precipitated onto gold particles and bombarded onto day old arabidopsis cell suspensions and freshly peeled onion epidermal cells using the _PROTEIN_ biolistic transformation system . for putative physcomitrella proteins transformation was also performed on day old protonemal tissues . following incubation for h at in the dark _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was visualized at magnification using a olympus microscope with the excitation wavelengths of nm _METHOD_ and nm _METHOD_ and emission wavelengths of nm _METHOD_ and nm _METHOD_ . images were captured using cellr imaging software as previously described .
