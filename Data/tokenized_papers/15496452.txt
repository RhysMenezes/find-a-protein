the eukaryotic nucleolus is involved in ribosome biogenesis and a wide range of other rna metabolism and cellular functions . an important step in the functional analysis of the nucleolus is to determine the complement of proteins of this _LOCATION_ compartment . here we describe the first proteomic analysis of plant nucleoli in which we have identified proteins . this allows a direct comparison of the proteomes of an important _LOCATION_ structure between two widely divergent species human and arabidopsis . the comparison identified many common proteins plant specific proteins proteins of unknown function found in both proteomes and proteins that were nucleolar in plants but nonnucleolar in human . seventy two proteins were _PROTEIN_ as _METHOD_ fusions and showed nucleolar or nucleolar associated localization . in a striking and unexpected finding we have identified six components of the postsplicing exon junction complex involved in mrna export and nonsense mediated decay /mrna surveillance . this association was confirmed by _METHOD_ fusion protein localization . these results raise the possibility that in plants nucleoli may have additional functions in mrna export or surveillance .
nucleoli were purified from _LOCATION_ prepared from arabidopsis cell culture protoplasts . the nucleolar preparation was characterized by phase contrast optical microscopy and also by _METHOD_ microscopy after staining with pyronin y _METHOD_ and showed small discrete nucleoli essentially free of contaminating _LOCATION_ debris and chromatin . the nucleoli were also characterized by _METHOD_ labeling with an antibody to the nucleolar protein . tandem _METHOD_ spectrometric analysis of complex mixtures of peptides generated by tryptic digestion of aliquots of the nucleolar preparation identified different proteins . the inserts from cdna clones were transferred into a plant gateway compatible binary vector designed to _PROTEIN_ n terminal _METHOD_ protein fusions from the cauliflower mosaic virus promoter . for localization we used transient _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis cell cultures using agrobacterium infection which gave strong reproducible _PROTEIN_ . _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was successfully detected in clones and _PROTEIN_ patterns were imaged using either confocal microscopy or wide field ccd imaging followed by image deconvolution . although it is possible that some of the localizations observed may be affected by the addition of _METHOD_ or by overexpression in the transient system the range of different labeling patterns observed the expected localization of proteins of known function and the differential localization of similar proteins argue against the observed patterns being artifacts . in addition use of the ccd camera allowed the imaging of cells which fluoresced weakly to minimize the possibility of artifacts due to overexpression . for each fusion a range of cells with relatively low levels of _METHOD_ were examined . the localization of each construct was annotated with a controlled vocabulary _LOCATION_ . this annotation is included in supplementary table . overall statistics of the localization are shown in table and a selection of different _METHOD_ fusions is shown in figure . different localization patterns were observed with various combinations of labeling of the nucleolus nucleolar associated structures _LOCATION_ bodies nucleoplasm or extranuclear labeling . in some cases the fusion proteins were largely restricted to the nucleolus whereas in others the nucleoplasm and/or other _LOCATION_ structures or regions were also labeled . many fusion proteins labeled small _LOCATION_ bodies in addition to the nucleolus some of which were reminiscent of cajal bodies or speckles . some fusions showed clear labeling of nucleolar associated structures or subdomains . from the _METHOD_ fusions surveyed showed strong labeling of the nucleolus and showed weak labeling such that showed some degree of labeling of the nucleolus and thus would be expected to be present in a purified nucleolar fraction . on the other hand two _METHOD_ fusions labeled the nucleoplasm and appeared to be excluded from the nucleolus . only showed only extranuclear/cytoplasmic labeling and of the proteins and only are putative cytoplasmic chloroplast or mitochondrial proteins . because of the greater sensitivity of detection by _METHOD_ _METHOD_ the results from _METHOD_ _METHOD_ may be an underestimate of the number of proteins in the nucleolus . lack of accumulation in the nucleolus of some _METHOD_ fusions may be due to the protein being either present in low abundance or only transiently associated with the nucleolus at particular cell stages or under certain conditions . overall these results provide the most practical assessment and verification that the majority of identified proteins are bona fide nucleolar components . of the arabidopsis nucleolar set of proteins and had homologous proteins encoded in the human and yeast genomes respectively . we also compared the arabidopsis proteins to the core set of proteins identified in the human nucleolus which extends the initial published human nucleolar proteome of proteins . just over two thirds of the arabidopsis proteins had a direct counterpart in the human nucleolar proteome . the profile of the arabidopsis nucleolar proteome resembled that of human in containing many expected nucleolar proteins _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ ribosome biogenesis proteins _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and ribosomal proteins . in addition there were many components of transcription splicing and translation dead box proteins and rna/dna interacting/modifying proteins nucleotide binding proteins and chaperones . thirty seven proteins were of unknown function . all eight core proteins of the box c/d and box h/aca snornps _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and were present along with specific proteins and nonsnornp proteins involved in snornp assembly or nucleolar localization _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . arabidopsis contains three fibrillarin genes but only two _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are _PROTEIN_ and both are detected in the proteomic analysis . in addition among a range of rna interacting proteins were nine dead/h box putative rna helicase proteins a class of proteins with important functions in rna metabolism . these included the nucleolar rna helicase ii two splicing helicases including and eif recently identified as an exon junction complex protein . in addition five other dead/h box proteins identified were also found in the human proteome . nearly different ribosomal proteins were identified making up of the proteins detected in the arabidopsis proteomic analysis . the multigenic nature of many plant and arabidopsis genes is clearly demonstrated by ribosomal protein genes where to date genes have been identified in the arabidopsis genome . the genes represent variants of different ribosomal protein genes organized into gene families with two to seven members and contrasts greatly with human and yeast where most ribosomal proteins are encoded by a single gene . where gene families encode identical or very similar proteins _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ the different _METHOD_ may not be distinguished by the _METHOD_ analysis . in contrast for other gene families which encode proteins with more variable sequences different _METHOD_ were identified . the direct comparison between the protein profiles of arabidopsis and human nucleoli has given rise to a number of novel observations . first proteins of unknown function were plant specific possibly reflecting the differences in structure of plant and animal nucleoli differences in rrna gene organization and transcription and the presence of a nucleolar cavity . for example five of the plant specific proteins are potential dna interacting proteins which may reflect differences in plant rrna transcription . second proteins of unknown function were conserved proteins found in both plant and animal nucleoli . one such protein was also present in a proteomic analysis of human _PROTEIN_ containing pre rrnp complexes demonstrating its close association with ribosome biogenesis . similarly the wd repeat containing protein of unknown function encoded by _GENE_ is a homologue of found in the yeast _PROTEIN_ processome along with proteins _PROTEIN_ and . some of the other human/plant conserved proteins contained recognized domains involved in rna protein and protein protein interactions repeat _PROTEIN_ and rna binding domains . of plant specific or plant human conserved proteins for which _METHOD_ fusions were constructed labeled the nucleolus strongly with some also labeling _LOCATION_ bodies . third many known proteins not expected to be nucleolar proteins were either found in both proteomes or strongly associated only with the plant nucleolus . for example our results show the presence in the nucleolus of many proteins involved in pre mrna splicing and translation . this _METHOD_ similar unexpected findings in the human nucleolar proteome . in arabidopsis the majority of splicing proteins detected were snrnp core proteins _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ smf and smg and snrnp specific proteins and the and proteins . this observation is consistent with previous evidence for the presence of and snrnas in the nucleolar cavity in plant nucleoli . in addition glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase a glycolytic enzyme was found in both the arabidopsis and human nucleolar proteomes . the arabidopsis gapdh _METHOD_ fusion protein showed clear labeling of the nucleoplasm and fainter labeling of the nucleolus . thirty nine of the arabidopsis proteins have human homologues that however are not present in the more extensive human nucleolar proteome . this number is too great to represent contamination of the plant nucleolar preparation and indeed only five of these proteins are probable contaminants being organellar or associated with _LOCATION_ or _LOCATION_ . the remaining proteins potentially reflect either divergent functions or different localization between _METHOD_ and include for example exon junction complex proteins and s adenosylmethionine synthetase . a surprising finding was the presence in the nucleolar proteome of six proteins known from animal studies to be part of the exon junction complex aly/ref _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and the eukaryotic translation initiation _PROTEIN_ iii . the ejc is a multiprotein complex that marks splice junctions in mrnas after mrna splicing linking transcription and processing to mrna export and nmd . the ejc contains spliceosome associated proteins _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ which interact with mrnp export _PROTEIN_ proteins and proteins involved in nonsense mediated decay _PROTEIN_ . the arabidopsis proteins _PROTEIN_ ataly and iii all showed clear localization to the nucleolus as well as labeling of the nucleoplasm . _PROTEIN_ labels the nucleolus much more strongly than the nucleoplasm and in particular the peripheral nucleolar region . in addition it is located in foci in the nucleolar cavity . _PROTEIN_ is also concentrated in numerous small nucleoplasmic bodies compared with the faint diffuse labeling of the nucleoplasm . in contrast atmago shows strong nucleoplasmic labeling with a number of small bodies and fainter punctuate nucleolar labeling . shows intense foci in the nucleolar cavity with diffuse nonuniform nucleoplasmic labeling . also shows accumulation in the nucleolar cavity but is more diffuse than _PROTEIN_ or and also shows strong nucleoplasmic labeling . ataly labels the nucleolus strongly and shows a more discrete _LOCATION_ speckled labeling . finally iii labels the nucleolus and _LOCATION_ bodies strongly with fainter nucleoplasmic labeling . thus all six ejc proteins found in the nucleolar proteomic preparation showed localization in the nucleolus suggesting that the nucleolus may be a site of storage assembly or function of the ejc components or complexes or involved in other rna metabolism processes . we have also identified arabidopsis homologues of all known ejc components . ataly at dek and _PROTEIN_ comprise small multigene families which is a feature of many plant genes and may reflect the prevalence of hybridization and polyploidy in plant evolution . the remaining ejc components had a single homologue apart from tap for which no plant homologue has yet been identified . to investigate whether there are potential functional differences between homologues full length cdnas and _METHOD_ fusions were prepared for the three remaining aly genes . the labeling pattern of each of the four ataly proteins was distinct showing differential _LOCATION_ and subnuclear localizations . ataly labeled the nucleoplasm strongly in a speckled network including bright foci with only very faint labeling of the nucleolus . like ataly both ataly and ataly labeled the nucleolus strongly but nucleoplasmic labeling with ataly was less intense than with the other aly homologues . ataly showed a small number of intensely staining bodies in contrast to ataly which had a speckled pattern . ataly consistently labeled a peripheral region of the nucleolus .
an arabidopsis suspension culture derived from a landsberg _LOCATION_ line was used as a source of material for nucleolar purification . cultures were grown at in the light with constant shaking on an orbital incubator at rpm in _PROTEIN_ medium and were harvested d after subculturing by gentle centrifugation and then protoplasts were generated essentially as described by saxena et al . . cells were treated with cell wall degrading enzymes _PROTEIN_ koh ph mm for h at room temperature until smooth round protoplasts were obtained as judged by light microscopy . the protoplasts were spun at g for min and resuspended in percoll buffer overlaid with a stepwise percoll gradient and spun at g for min . the intact protoplasts floated to the interface and were collected by pipette . they were washed twice in m sorbitol mm mes koh ph mm and quantified using a hemocytometer . finally they were resuspended in _LOCATION_ isolation buffer at a concentration of no more than protoplasts/ml and were ruptured by strokes in a stainless steel homogenizer . in some cases _LOCATION_ were produced first and then resuspended in nib and further homogenized to produce nucleoli . the nucleoli were gently pelleted then resuspended in m sucrose mm and frozen in aliquots at . control of the was important if was added to the nib the nucleoli could not be separated from the network of _LOCATION_ chromatin fibers whereas without in the buffer the nucleoli began to show signs of disintegration after h. therefore was added to the storage buffer within min of _LOCATION_ breakage . liter of cell culture generated _LOCATION_ and subsequently nucleoli . all stages were monitored by phase contrast light microscopy . _METHOD_ spectrometric analysis of isolated arabidopsis nucleoli was done as previously described . briefly arabidopsis nucleoli from of the suspension were solubilized in of m urea mm tris hcl ph and then reduced in dtt at rt for h. iodoactamide and of endoproteinase lys c were added and the mixture was incubated at rt for h. the mixture was then diluted with mm and incubated with of trypsin at rt for an additional h. the resulting peptide mixture was desalted and concentrated and then pressure loaded onto a pulled fused silica capillary with an internal diameter of and a tip opening of filled with vydac _METHOD_ reverse phase material . peptides were eluted directly into a quadrupole time of flight _METHOD_ spectrometer with a min linear gradient of buffer b from an hplc system . combined peak lists were searched in the international protein index database using the mascot program _PROTEIN_ . arabidopsis protein sequences identified in the proteomic analysis were compared with proteins encoded in the human and yeast genome and to the core set of proteins identified in human nucleoli using blast . alignments of all comparisons with an e value of more than were examined visually to determine their significance . to confirm the similarity of best matches between arabidopsis and human proteins and to identify other related arabidopsis genes a reciprocal blast of the human protein with the highest score was carried out against the arabidopsis protein database . in the majority of cases the human protein identified the original arabidopsis protein or a related protein . the reciprocal blast analysis also identified homologous genes providing information on multigene families . in a small number of cases the human protein identified a different arabidopsis protein than the original arabidopsis protein . this suggests that either the homology between the proteins is low or limited to particular domains and/or arabidopsis contains proteins not identified in the proteomic analysis but which have stronger matches to human proteins . this may reflect different functions of the related proteins or that the limitations of the proteomic analysis have not yet identified all proteins in the plant nucleolus . the list of putative nucleolar proteins was used to search the _PROTEIN_ orfeome database . approximately half of the cdnas were available as trimmed u clones . the _PROTEIN_ clones were transferred to a binary plant _PROTEIN_ vector designed to _PROTEIN_ n terminal _METHOD_ fusions of the proteins _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis suspension culture cells as described by koroleva et al . . briefly the coding regions from the _PROTEIN_ puni u clones were amplified by high fidelity pcr using standard primers for the adjacent vector sequence and then inserted by recombinase cloning into a standard gateway entry vector . the entry vector clones were then transferred by recombinase cloning en _METHOD_ in well format into gateway binary plant _PROTEIN_ vector _METHOD_ n bin designed to _PROTEIN_ n terminal _METHOD_ fusions of the proteins _METHOD_ . the binary vector clones were then used to transform agrobacterium . the transformed agrobacterium lines were used in transient _PROTEIN_ experiments with arabidopsis suspensions as described by koroleva et al . . for microscopy a small volume of suspension was placed on a slide and covered with a coverglass which was held in place by nail polish . initial surveys of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ were carried out on a nikon _METHOD_ microscope . detailed imaging was carried out either using a leica sp laser scanning confocal microscope _METHOD_ or a wide field ccd camera microscope _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ . ccd images were deconvolved using a maximum likelihood blind restoration algorithm . the use of a high sensitivity ccd camera enabled us to image faintly labeled cells thus minimizing the chance of mis localization due to overexpression . for each cell a single section through the middle of the nucleolus was selected from the data stacks . image montages were prepared using imagej a public domain image processing program written by wayne rasband and adobe photoshop .
