_PROTEIN_ a cysteine desulfurase required to supply sulfur for ironsulfur cluster biogenesis in arabidopsis thaliana chloroplasts belongs to a class of nifs like enzymes with low endogenous cysteine desulfurase activity . its bacterial homologue _PROTEIN_ is stimulated by sufe . here we characterize the arabidopsis chloroplast protein _PROTEIN_ which has an n terminal sufe like domain and a c terminal bola like domain unique to higher plants . _PROTEIN_ is targeted to the chloroplast stroma indicated by green _METHOD_ protein localization and immunoblot experiments . like _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ in all major tissues with higher _PROTEIN_ in green parts . its _PROTEIN_ is light dependent and regulated at the mrna level . the addition of purified recombinant _PROTEIN_ increased the vmax for the cysteine desulfurase activity of _PROTEIN_ over fold and _PROTEIN_ the km toward cysteine from to mm . in contrast _PROTEIN_ addition _PROTEIN_ the affinity of _PROTEIN_ for selenocysteine as indicated by an increase in the km from to mm and _PROTEIN_ the vmax for selenocysteine lyase activity by . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ dynamic complexes with _PROTEIN_ indicated by gel filtration native _PROTEIN_ and affinity chromatography experiments . a mutant of _PROTEIN_ in which the single cysteine was changed to serine was not active in stimulating _PROTEIN_ although it did compete with wt _PROTEIN_ . the iron sulfur cluster reconstitution activity of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ complex toward apoferredoxin was fold higher than that of _PROTEIN_ alone . we conclude that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ together form a cysteine desulfurase required for iron sulfur cluster formation in chloroplasts .
identification of _PROTEIN_ and sequence is a cys desulfurase required for iron sulfur cluster formation in the chloroplast . however compared with most cys desulfurases with a housekeeping role in fe s cluster formation the cys desulfurase activity of purified _PROTEIN_ is very low despite a high selenocysteine lyase activity . when the in vitro reconstitution activity of purified _PROTEIN_ protein was compared with the activity of _PROTEIN_ in stromal extracts it was concluded that _PROTEIN_ in stroma is about times more active . thus a stimulatory activity must be present in _LOCATION_ . we considered that this stimulatory activity could at least in part be explained if _LOCATION_ contain a homologue of sufe a protein that stimulates the cys desulfurase activity of the bacterial _PROTEIN_ proteins . a sufe like sequence was identified by a blast search within the arabidopsis genome data base using the e. coli sufe as a query sequence . the genomic sequence of _GENE_ contains a single predicted exon . a cdna containing the full coding sequence was obtained by reverse transcription pcr . sequence analysis of the cdna confirmed the presence of a single uninterrupted coding sequence in the genome . the open reading frame is predicted to encode a full length precursor protein of amino acids including a putative chloroplast targeting peptide as predicted by the targetp program . because of the predicted location and similarity with sufe proteins we named _GENE_ _PROTEIN_ for chloroplastic sufe . the predicted mature polypeptide is amino acids long with a molecular _METHOD_ of kda and an isoelectric point of . the mature size of the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ homologue is much larger than what was reported for the bacterial sufe proteins which are about kda in size . a sequence alignment was performed to determine the similarity of the putative arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ with possible sufe homologues from various _METHOD_ as shown in fig . . the predicted cleavable chloroplast targeting sequence of the arabidopsis protein is underlined . a similar n terminal extension predicted to be a transit sequence by the targetp program is also found in the rice protein but is not found in the prokaryotic homologues as expected . all sufe homologues show sequence conservation in the mature protein domain including a highly conserved single cysteine that was shown to be critical for function in the bacterial proteins . this sufe domain region corresponds to the n terminal half of the predicted mature proteins in arabidopsis and rice . in this region the plant proteins are most related in sequence to the cyanobacterial sufe . for example the sequence motif gcvsqv which includes the conserved cys is conserved between arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ rice and cyanobacterial sufe but different in the other bacterial proteins . the two plant proteins are predicted to have a c terminal domain of about amino acids which is absent from the prokaryotic homologues . the last residues of this plant specific c terminal protein domain show very good sequence similarity to e. coli bola . bola of e. coli may function in the control of cell shape in response to nutrition . bola like proteins are found ubiquitously but so far a molecular function has not been identified for these proteins experimentally . however recent bioinformatic approaches have suggested that bola domains may interact with members of the monothiol glutaredoxins . the rice and arabidopsis proteins display good sequence conservation over their entire length but the conservation in the bola like domain is even higher with identity this sequence conservation suggests a significant function for the bola region of _PROTEIN_ in vivo . localization of _PROTEIN_ in targetp program predicted a cleavable transit sequence of amino acids and a chloroplast localization of _PROTEIN_ . to examine the subcellular localization we constructed fusions with _METHOD_ . in the first construct the _PROTEIN_ transit peptide was fused to the n terminus of _METHOD_ in a second construct the full length precursor _PROTEIN_ was fused to the n terminus of _METHOD_ . _METHOD_ alone _PROTEIN_ from the same constitutive promoter was used as a control . constructs were separately introduced into arabidopsis protoplasts and the localization in cells was analyzed using confocal laser microscopy . _METHOD_ corresponding to _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ without a transit sequence was excluded from the chloroplasts as expected . in contrast green _METHOD_ from the transit sequence fusion was localized to the chloroplast stroma as indicated by the overlay of green _METHOD_ and red _METHOD_ . green _METHOD_ from the full length _PROTEIN_ coupled to _METHOD_ was localized to discrete locations in the chloroplasts . the localization of _PROTEIN_ in chloroplast stroma was verified by immunoblotting . _PROTEIN_ antibody detected as little as ng of purified _PROTEIN_ . the antibody detected a protein of kda in total leaf homogenate and this signal was quantitatively recovered in the chloroplast stroma fraction . the preimmune serum at the same dilution did not recognize any bands in these samples . these data indicate the presence of _PROTEIN_ in stroma . based on the band intensities we estimate that the amount of _PROTEIN_ present in of stromal protein is between and ng . thus the abundance of _PROTEIN_ in stroma is between and of total protein similar to the abundance reported for _PROTEIN_ . in conclusion the immunoblotting and _METHOD_ experiments strongly suggest a stromal localization of _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ analysis of _PROTEIN_ patterns can give clues about the function of a protein . to determine the _PROTEIN_ mrna and protein _PROTEIN_ patterns in different arabidopsis tissues we performed rna blot and immunoblot analyses and quantified band intensities . the rna blot analysis revealed that _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ in all tested tissues with a fold higher _PROTEIN_ level in leaves compared with nongreen tissues . the _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ transcript in the stem was fold higher than in the roots and flowers . immunoblots confirmed this _PROTEIN_ pattern at the protein level and showed that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ have comparable _PROTEIN_ patterns . as quantified the _PROTEIN_ protein _PROTEIN_ in leaf was fold higher than in the stem flower and root . the presence of _PROTEIN_ in _LOCATION_ and the elevated _PROTEIN_ in green tissues are typical for proteins involved in photosynthesis . many photosynthesis related genes are regulated by light . we therefore investigated if _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is influenced by light . _PROTEIN_ protein was found to be _PROTEIN_ less by fold in plants grown in the dark compared with light grown plants and this can be ascribed to fold lower _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ mrna in the dark . however although there was lower _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in the dark there was still significant _PROTEIN_ and the effect of light on the _PROTEIN_ of the large subunit of ribulose bisphosphate _PROTEIN_ a known light induced chloroplast protein was larger in comparison . _PROTEIN_ stimulates cys desulfurase activity and changes the substrate affinity of _PROTEIN_ allow us to investigate the activity of _PROTEIN_ we purified the mature sized protein . the n terminus of the protein was fused to a tag and a thrombin cleavage site for efficient purification by immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography . to remove the tag the protein was incubated with thrombin at until the tag was completely cleaved as judged by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ followed by staining for total protein with _METHOD_ brilliant blue and _PROTEIN_ was purified from the mixture by hplc using a resource q anion exchange column . the purified _PROTEIN_ was a colorless protein with a _METHOD_ of about kda as judged by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ a slightly slower migration than what is expected based on the theoretical molecular _METHOD_ of kda . however _PROTEIN_ is rather acidic and this may well influence the mobility on _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . n terminal sequence analysis yielded the sequence _METHOD_ which indicated that the protein was correctly cleaved and purified . the cleaved _PROTEIN_ was used for all biochemical characterizations unless indicated otherwise . the purified recombinant _PROTEIN_ eluted as a dimer from an analytic gel filtration column . _PROTEIN_ alone did not show any activity in either the cys desulfurase assay or the secys lyase assay both of which are activities displayed by _PROTEIN_ . to test if _PROTEIN_ changes the kinetic properties of _PROTEIN_ the activities of _PROTEIN_ alone and of _PROTEIN_ plus _PROTEIN_ in a molar ratio were assayed over a concentration range for both substrates . _PROTEIN_ alone displayed a barely detectable level of cys desulfurase activity but displayed high secys lyase activity in agreement with our previous results . however when _PROTEIN_ was added to _PROTEIN_ in a molar ratio we observed a fold increase in the vmax for cys desulfurase activity compared with _PROTEIN_ alone . in contrast the vmax for secys lyase activity was reduced by . the addition of _PROTEIN_ to _PROTEIN_ caused the km for cysteine to _PROTEIN_ fold . on the other hand the km for selenocysteine increased slightly . thus the vmax/km ratio of _PROTEIN_ was increased fold by _PROTEIN_ . titration experiments at saturating substrate concentration in which the amount of _PROTEIN_ was kept constant while _PROTEIN_ was varied indicated that the cys desulfurase activity of _PROTEIN_ depended on the amount of _PROTEIN_ present . the stimulation by _PROTEIN_ reached an apparent saturation point at a _PROTEIN_ molar ratio of at which point we observed a fold stimulation . _PROTEIN_ has cysteines one of which is conserved and predicted to be required for cys desulfurase activity based on similarity with bacterial csdb for which a structure is published . to investigate if this cysteine in _PROTEIN_ is required for the activity of the protein we purified a mutant _PROTEIN_ in which the cysteine was altered to serine . purified _PROTEIN_ displayed the same absorbance spectrum and elution profile from a gel filtration column as the wt protein . similar to what had been found for the csdb cys mutant the mutant _PROTEIN_ protein retained about of its secys lyase activity . this indicates that under the assay conditions the decomposition of selenocysteine does not depend on the active site cysteine and that the mutant _PROTEIN_ enzyme was folded and active . however the _PROTEIN_ mutant protein had no detectable cys desulfurase activity anymore neither alone nor with _PROTEIN_ present . thus the conserved cysteine is essential for cys desulfurase activity of _PROTEIN_ but not for secys lyase activity . _PROTEIN_ has a single conserved cysteine in its mature sequence . to test the requirement of the thiol group for _PROTEIN_ activity we _PROTEIN_ and purified a mutant in which the cysteine was changed to serine . like the wild type _PROTEIN_ the mutant _PROTEIN_ did not show activity by itself . only wt _PROTEIN_ and not _PROTEIN_ displayed stimulation of _PROTEIN_ cys desulfurase activity indicating that the conserved cysteine is essential for this function . both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ had a similar small but noticeable negative effect on the secys lyase activity of _PROTEIN_ . the mutation in _PROTEIN_ is dominant negative in tested the effect of the presence of the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ cys mutants on the activity of wt _PROTEIN_ and wt _PROTEIN_ . interestingly the presence of _PROTEIN_ severely inhibited the stimulatory activation of _PROTEIN_ by wt _PROTEIN_ in a concentration dependent manner thus showing a dominant negative effect in vitro . in marked contrast even a fold excess of mutant _PROTEIN_ did not inhibit the activation of wt _PROTEIN_ by _PROTEIN_ . a straightforward interpretation of these observations is that in these incubations the mutant _PROTEIN_ titrates wt _PROTEIN_ into an inactive complex whereas mutant _PROTEIN_ does not titrate away wt _PROTEIN_ from wt _PROTEIN_ . the difference may be explained by differences in affinity between mutant and wt proteins that in turn may be related to the ability to decompose cysteine or accept s. _PROTEIN_ complexes with _PROTEIN_ observed alterations of the catalytic properties of _PROTEIN_ by _PROTEIN_ prompted us to investigate if _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ form a complex . to address this question we first performed a gel filtration analysis . the native molecular weight of recombinant _PROTEIN_ and of the _PROTEIN_ mutant was determined by comparing the elution time from a superdex gel filtration column with standards . in gel filtration experiments _PROTEIN_ eluted in single peak at min . the same elution profile was seen for _PROTEIN_ . the retention time of min corresponds to an estimated molecular _METHOD_ of kda indicating that purified recombinant _PROTEIN_ and the _PROTEIN_ mutant are homodimeric proteins . _PROTEIN_ eluted as a single peak at min which corresponds to a size of kda in agreement with the _METHOD_ expected for homodimeric _PROTEIN_ . when wt _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were mixed in a molar ratio and applied to the gel filtration column we found most of the protein to elute in a peak with a retention time of min . comparison with standards indicated an apparent molecular _METHOD_ of kda indicating the formation of a complex that is significantly smaller than the added _METHOD_ of two dimers together . the published structure for the homologous e. coli _PROTEIN_ protein suggests a very stable dimer structure for _PROTEIN_ . indeed the _PROTEIN_ dimer is very stable and we have never observed monomers of this protein . we thus consider it likely that trace in fig . represents a heterotrimer of two _PROTEIN_ subunits and one _PROTEIN_ subunit which is in agreement with the estimated size of the complex . indeed both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were found to be present in the peak as judged from _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ but _PROTEIN_ seemed less abundant in the peak fractions and the addition of more _PROTEIN_ shifted the complex to a higher molecular weight . when the mutated _PROTEIN_ was incubated with _PROTEIN_ and loaded onto the gel filtration column a peak with a retention time of min was observed corresponding with a complex with an apparent size of kda which is in good agreement with the cumulative molecular _METHOD_ of a _PROTEIN_ dimer and a _PROTEIN_ dimer a composition that is confirmed by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ analysis . these data indicate that the mutant _PROTEIN_ retains _PROTEIN_ binding ability and may have a higher affinity for _PROTEIN_ than the wt _PROTEIN_ . when the cysteine mutant of _PROTEIN_ was substituted for the wt protein and incubated with _PROTEIN_ the same elution pattern was obtained that was observed with wt _PROTEIN_ . therefore the affinity of wt and mutant _PROTEIN_ for _PROTEIN_ appears to be similar . as mentioned above the wt _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ proteins appear to form a sufe trimer when incubated at lower concentrations but this complex appears to shift to a heterotetramer when the _PROTEIN_ concentration is increased . a similar tetrameric complex was observed when the concentrations of both proteins were increased fold . the formation of the putative trimeric and tetrameric complexes and the effect of cysteine on complex formation were further investigated by native _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are both negatively charged and have a very similar _METHOD_ ratio . therefore we can expect that the mobility in native _PROTEIN_ will be _PROTEIN_ determined by the size of the native protein complex . when individual proteins were loaded onto the native gel _PROTEIN_ migrated as a single band presumably its dimeric form wt _PROTEIN_ also migrated as a single band presumably as a dimer . the mutant _PROTEIN_ also mostly migrated as this presumed dimeric form but a small fraction migrated in a band with higher mobility presumably the monomeric form . when the wt _PROTEIN_ and wt _PROTEIN_ were incubated in the absence of their substrate cysteine the dimeric _PROTEIN_ disappeared as did most of the dimeric _PROTEIN_ and instead a smear appeared representing a larger complex of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ possibly a heterotetramer that is perhaps somewhat unstable under the experimental conditions . in the presence of cysteine the same protein mixture formed two more distinct complexes . we hypothesize that these two newly appearing bands labeled i and ii are a trimeric sufe complex and a _PROTEIN_ heterotetramer respectively . the desulfuration triggered by addition of the cysteine substrate appears to stimulate the formation of the putative tetramer which may be the most active catalytic form of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ cysteine desulfurase complex . the latter is supported by the finding that an increase in the _PROTEIN_ ratio shifts the complex to a higher molecular weight and at the same time increases cys desulfurase activity of the complex . when the wt _PROTEIN_ protein was incubated with the mutant _PROTEIN_ in the absence of cysteine the results were comparable with incubation of both wt proteins . there was no effect however of the addition of cysteine probably because no desulfuration could be carried out by the mutant _PROTEIN_ . when the mutant _PROTEIN_ was incubated with wt _PROTEIN_ only the putative heterotetramer was observed _PROTEIN_ of the presence of cysteine and neither dimeric _PROTEIN_ nor dimeric _PROTEIN_ was observed . a straightforward interpretation is that the mutant _PROTEIN_ has a stronger affinity for _PROTEIN_ or that the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ complex is more stable . finally incubation of mutant _PROTEIN_ with mutant _PROTEIN_ resulted in only the putative trimeric complex _PROTEIN_ of the presence of cysteine . these results are similar to those observed when the mutant _PROTEIN_ was incubated with wt _PROTEIN_ and may indicate that mutant _PROTEIN_ has a reduced binding ability to _PROTEIN_ . these native _PROTEIN_ results confirm the presence of different _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ complexes and also explain the dominant negative effect of _PROTEIN_ when added to wt . the nifs and sufe proteins form complexes even when the active site cys residues in both proteins are changed to serine . still the active site residues in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ clearly affect the nature of the complexes that are formed . furthermore the effect of cys on complex formation between the wt proteins suggests that conformational changes occur in _PROTEIN_ upon the completion of a round of desulfuration which in turn may facilitate a release of _PROTEIN_ from the complex . it thus appears that _PROTEIN_ is in dynamic exchange between a free _PROTEIN_ and several complexed states . investigating the formation of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ formation of a _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ complex was further investigated in nickel column coelution experiments . we used the tagged _PROTEIN_ and incubated the protein with an equal amount of _PROTEIN_ before loading onto a ni _PROTEIN_ column . the column was treated with a series of salt washes before elution with m imidazole . samples of the loaded and imidazole eluted proteins were analyzed by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . wild type _PROTEIN_ was found to co elute with the his tagged wild type _PROTEIN_ . control experiments showed that _PROTEIN_ did not bind to the nickel column by itself . the same elution pattern was found for _PROTEIN_ and his tagged _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ of whether the proteins had the wild type sequences or were mutated at the essential cysteine residues . therefore in this nickel column binding assay _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are again shown to interact and this interaction does not require the conserved cys residues in either protein which are however needed for cys desulfurase activity . another chloroplast protein _PROTEIN_ which may serve as a chloroplast scaffold protein for fe s assembly did not co elute with _PROTEIN_ or with _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . the observation of the putative trimeric sufe complex in addition to the putative _PROTEIN_ heterotetramer suggests the involvement of the _PROTEIN_ monomer in the formation of the complex . this hypothesis was further investigated by nickel column coelution experiments . we mixed dimeric his tagged _PROTEIN_ with separately purified dimeric untagged _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ either with or without cysteine . the protein mixture was loaded onto a ni _PROTEIN_ column and eluted with m imidazole to select for his tagged _PROTEIN_ and any proteins associated with it . the cleaved untagged _PROTEIN_ which does not bind to the column by itself and _PROTEIN_ were found to co elute with his tagged _PROTEIN_ . this presence of untagged _PROTEIN_ in a complex with tagged _PROTEIN_ can be explained by the formation of a heterotetramer containing a cleaved _PROTEIN_ a histagged _PROTEIN_ and two _PROTEIN_ subunits . cysteine had no notable effect in this experimental protocol . when the mutant _PROTEIN_ was mixed with the his tagged _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ the cleaved _PROTEIN_ also coeluted with the other two components in the m imidazole fraction . however much less complex coeluted with the his tagged wt _PROTEIN_ when it had to compete with the _PROTEIN_ mutant again indicating that the mutant _PROTEIN_ has a higher affinity for _PROTEIN_ than wt _PROTEIN_ and explaining the dominant negative effect of the mutant _PROTEIN_ on stimulation of _PROTEIN_ cys desulfurase activity by wt _PROTEIN_ . the formation of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ complex suggests that _PROTEIN_ is incorporated into the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ complex in the form of monomers as schematically depicted in fig . . _PROTEIN_ enhances the fe s reconstitution in ferredoxin quantitatively measure fe s cluster formation a fe s reconstitution assay for ferredoxin was used . the effect of _PROTEIN_ on the fe s cluster formation in ferredoxin was tested in these _PROTEIN_ dependent reconstitution assays . _PROTEIN_ by itself did not mediate any fe s cluster formation whereas _PROTEIN_ only displayed a very low level of activity . however the mixture of of _PROTEIN_ and of _PROTEIN_ reconstituted of ferredoxin equivalent to the activity of of pure _PROTEIN_ . this indicated a fold enhancement of _PROTEIN_ dependent fe s cluster formation by _PROTEIN_ .
