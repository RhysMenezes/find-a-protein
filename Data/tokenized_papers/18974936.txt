_PROTEIN_ from arabidopsis thaliana belongs to a novel class of plant proteins characterized by a heavy metal associated domain and an additional isoprenylation motif . it is induced during cold salt and drought stress . the _LOCATION_ localization of _PROTEIN_ predicted by a nls motif could be confirmed in onion epidermal cells overexpressing _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . experiments with modified _PROTEIN_ indicate that the isoprenylation plays a role in the spatial distribution in the _LOCATION_ . using promoter gus constructs a tissue specific _PROTEIN_ pattern of _PROTEIN_ could be shown with high _PROTEIN_ in the vascular tissue . by a yeast two hybrid approach a strong interaction of _PROTEIN_ with the zinc finger homeodomain transcription _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ which is known to play a role in dehydration stress response could be detected . this was confirmed by _PROTEIN_ pull down assays . when using a modified _PROTEIN_ lacking the two central cysteines of the heavy metal associated domain _PROTEIN_ was not bound in the _PROTEIN_ pull down assay indicating that this structure is necessary for the interaction . further yeast two hybrid analyses testing interaction of different members of the _PROTEIN_ family with related zinc finger transcription _PROTEIN_ revealed a specific interaction of _PROTEIN_ with several _PROTEIN_ proteins . a functional relationship between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ is also indicated by experiments with mutants of _PROTEIN_ showing altered _PROTEIN_ levels of such genes known to be regulated by _PROTEIN_ .
recently we identified from barley a novel _LOCATION_ localized protein with a heavy metal associated domain and a c terminal isoprenylation motif _METHOD_ . data bank research revealed that in arabidopsis thaliana there are at least genes coding for proteins containing one or more heavy metal associated domains with two characteristic cysteines and additionally a c terminal isoprenylation motif . figure shows the genetic tree of all hma domains of the arabidopsis proteins encoded by these genes . because of the two characteristic features the heavy metal associated domain and the isoprenylation motif we denoted all these proteins _PROTEIN_ . in fig . we list both the _PROTEIN_ code and the novel _PROTEIN_ nomenclature . based on the sequence homologies all the _PROTEIN_ proteins cluster in six different groups . in this work we focus on cluster iii of the arabidopsis thaliana _PROTEIN_ family showing highest homology to the cold regulated barley gene _METHOD_ . figure shows exemplarily the protein structure of one member of cluster iii _PROTEIN_ which in addition to the hma domain with its central hma motif and the typical _PROTEIN_ terminal caax motif for isoprenylation and next to this caax motif a highly conserved sequence which can be found in a large number of isoprenylated plant proteins _PROTEIN_ also contains a nls _LOCATION_ . similar to the barley protein _METHOD_ and the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ some other _PROTEIN_ of cluster iii contain a _LOCATION_ localization signal made up of basic amino acids lysine arginine and histidine . these are _PROTEIN_ and predicting a _LOCATION_ localization of these proteins . additionally a n terminal myristoylation motif can be found in _PROTEIN_ and . a web based signal scan of the bp upstream sequence of _PROTEIN_ using the plant cis acting regulatory dna elements database revealed the presence of a high number of potential cis acting regulatory dna elements . in fig . we show the predicted positions of the typical stress responsive elements ltre _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ box _PROTEIN_ ccaat box myc recognition site _PROTEIN_ and myb recognition sites _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ of cluster iii in response to cold treatment at an early and a _PROTEIN_ phase was analyzed by quantitative realtime pcr . _PROTEIN_ levels of the genes is represented as fold difference over the control which is considered as . although all used primers in the pcr yielded a product when using genomic dna transcripts of two genes _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were not detectable with this sensitive method indicating that these two genes are not _PROTEIN_ at least under the conditions used . the cold treatment results in the induction of four genes from this cluster _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are highly induced within the first h of the cold treatment . in _PROTEIN_ stages of the stress treatment the _PROTEIN_ levels of these genes _PROTEIN_ again indicating a fast and transient _PROTEIN_ pattern during cold stress . _PROTEIN_ shows induction only in the early phase . _PROTEIN_ is highly up regulated in _PROTEIN_ stages of the cold treatment showing high relative _PROTEIN_ levels at h treatment . all other _PROTEIN_ genes of cluster iii are either not induced or even repressed in response to the cold stress . _PROTEIN_ is that cold induced gene which shows the highest homology to the known barley _METHOD_ . its fast and transient induction in early phases of the stress treatment and the presence of a _LOCATION_ localization signal in addition to the two conserved domains hint at a possible regulatory function of this protein . because of these features we further concentrated on the functional analyses of _PROTEIN_ in this report . the barley gene _METHOD_ showed a complex _PROTEIN_ pattern with induction at different abiotic stress conditions during leaf senescence and in response to abscisic acid . therefore _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ was further analyzed under these conditions by quantitative realtime pcr . as shown in fig . aba has no influence on the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ . while drought stress shows only a slight effect salt stress clearly results in increased transcript levels of _PROTEIN_ . copper treatment and also leaf senescence rather inhibited _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ . these data prove that _PROTEIN_ is as the barley _METHOD_ clearly induced by cold . but in contrast to _METHOD_ which is also induced in response to aba and copper treatment and during leaf senescence _PROTEIN_ is not induced under these conditions indicating only a partial overlap in the induction pathways of the barley and the arabidopsis gene . the nls indicates _LOCATION_ localization of _PROTEIN_ . in order to confirm this we transformed epidermal onion cells by particle bombardment with two different smrs _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ constructs where _PROTEIN_ is fused to the c terminal end of smrs _METHOD_ . subcellular localization of the chimeric proteins was then analyzed by confocal laser scanning microscopy . the upper panel shows _METHOD_ of the _METHOD_ control alone without _PROTEIN_ . it reveals typical _METHOD_ _METHOD_ in the onion epidermal cells . when transformed with the _METHOD_ fusion to the wildtype _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ green _METHOD_ can be detected exclusively within the _LOCATION_ . this green _METHOD_ is concentrated in several speckle like structures within the _LOCATION_ . in addition to the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ construct which allows isoprenylation at the intact c terminal end we also performed the experiment with a modified _PROTEIN_ in which the c terminal cysteine was exchanged to a glycine . the corresponding _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ construct therefore can not be isoprenylated . the results are shown in fig . . this chimeric protein is also exclusively located within the _LOCATION_ of the onion epidermal cells . but in contrast to the intact _PROTEIN_ this protein which can not be isoprenylated is more uniformly located in the _LOCATION_ showing high green _METHOD_ in two defined round areas which were identified to be the nucleoli . our results prove on one hand the _LOCATION_ localization predicted by the nls motif and on the other hand indicate that the isoprenylation may be important for a specific localization of _PROTEIN_ within the _LOCATION_ . a yeast two hybrid screening was used to identify _PROTEIN_ interaction partners and _PROTEIN_ pull down experiments were done for verification . in the experiments we used three different constructs as bait the wildtype _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in which the c terminal cysteine is exchanged to a glycine and thereby isoprenylation is impossible and _PROTEIN_ with a deleted c terminus which can also not be isoprenylated . the screens using the cdna library obtained from the _PROTEIN_ stock centre were performed on the basis of dependent transcriptional activation of three different reporter genes . an interaction of the three _PROTEIN_ constructs with suitable library proteins was detected by a strong nutritional selection on synthetic dropout media lacking adenine via activation of the reporter gene . galactosidase and the reporter genes were also used for the characterisation of positive interacting clones . aminotriazole _PROTEIN_ a competitive inhibitor of the protein was used to enhance the stringency of the nutritional selection on synthetic dropout media lacking histidine . all results clearly prove a specific interaction of _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ a zinc finger homeodomain box transcription _PROTEIN_ . a clear interaction is detected even in the presence of mm _PROTEIN_ . the screening indicated another zinc finger homeodomain box protein to be a putative interaction partner of _PROTEIN_ . this is _PROTEIN_ . but the interaction _METHOD_ to be not as strong as with _PROTEIN_ since the detected galactosidase activity and growth of yeast under the stringent conditions with the inhibitor _PROTEIN_ are clearly reduced . the interaction between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ was confirmed by an independent experiment . a _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ construct was overexpressed in e. coli cells and by the _PROTEIN_ tag immobilized on glutathione sepharose . additionally a _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ construct was investigated in which the two central cysteines of the m/l/ixcxxc core sequence were exchanged by two glycines _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ was in vitro transcribed and in the presence of labelled methionine translated and then added to the glutathione sepharose coupled with the suitable _PROTEIN_ fusion proteins . the left part of fig . shows as input control of the radiolabelled protein . the right part shows a radioactive band only in that experiment where the wildtype _PROTEIN_ was used . neither in the _PROTEIN_ control nor in the experiment with the modified _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ could be pulled down . our data from the two independent approaches indicate that _PROTEIN_ interacts with the zinc finger homeodomain box transcription _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . for this interaction an intact heavy metal associated domain including the two central cysteines is important . _PROTEIN_ belongs to a arabidopsis zinc finger homeodomain box transcription _PROTEIN_ subfamily consisting of at least members _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . in order to test the specificity of the protein protein interaction between members of this family with the different _PROTEIN_ proteins of cluster iii yeast two hybrid assays were performed . figure indicates that _PROTEIN_ in addition to _PROTEIN_ also strongly interacts with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . the only other interactions detected were between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . the bp region upstream of the translational start _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ was fused to the gus gene and arabidopsis plants were transformed with this construct . a c shows controls transformed with the empty vector _PROTEIN_ which demonstrate no blue coloration . d and e show whole days old arabidopsis plants transformed with the _PROTEIN_ promotor gus construct . gus activity in these plants is clearly localized at the vascular tissue in the whole plant . in the petioles and upper part of the stem a more intense blue coloration can be detected . in the older plants gus activity is also present in the vascular veins shown in the leaves and petioles . these data prove a distinct _PROTEIN_ pattern of _PROTEIN_ in specific tissues within the plant . to further analyze the functional relationship between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ of known target genes of _PROTEIN_ was analyzed in wild type and mutant plants not _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . three genes _GENE_ _PROTEIN_ _GENE_ _PROTEIN_ and _GENE_ were due to genome wide transcript analyses for identification and testing of standard genes chosen as reference genes . their _PROTEIN_ levels are not changed in plants overexpressing _PROTEIN_ . _GENE_ was used as reference to normalise the quantitative realtime pcr data of the genes of interest . the data illustrated in fig . show that the relative gene _PROTEIN_ rates of _GENE_ and _GENE_ are not changed in mutant line when compared to the wild type . in contrast _PROTEIN_ levels of six stress related genes which have previously been shown to be highly up regulated after overexpression of _PROTEIN_ are clearly down regulated in plants . in addition we analyzed _PROTEIN_ of two known cold regulated genes _GENE_ _PROTEIN_ and _GENE_ _PROTEIN_ which are down regulated in _PROTEIN_ overexpression plants . both _PROTEIN_ down regulated genes show no significant difference in mrna levels in _PROTEIN_ mutant and wild type . our data show that loss of function of _PROTEIN_ inhibits _PROTEIN_ dependent induction of stress related target genes .
