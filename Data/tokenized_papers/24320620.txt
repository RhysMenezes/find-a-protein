sugar signaling pathways have been evolutionarily conserved among eukaryotes and are postulated to help regulate plant growth development and responses to environmental cues . forward genetic screens have identified sugar signaling or response mutants . here we report the identification and characterization of arabidopsis thaliana sugar mutants which display a sugar resistant seedling development phenotype . unlike many other sugar insensitive mutants mutants exhibit wild type responses to the inhibitory effects of abscisic acid and paclobutrazol on seed germination . positional cloning of the _PROTEIN_ gene revealed that it encodes a putative mitogen activated protein kinase kinase kinase . _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ ubiquitously among arabidopsis organs . a udp _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was identified as an interacting partner of _PROTEIN_ based on a yeast two hybrid screen and in planta bimolecular _METHOD_ complementation . both _PROTEIN_ yellow _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion proteins localize to the _LOCATION_ when transiently _PROTEIN_ in tobacco leaf cells . t dna insertions in _GENE_ cause a sugar insensitive phenotype . these results indicate that _PROTEIN_ a putative mapkkk is a regulator of sugar response in arabidopsis and interacts with a udp _PROTEIN_ in the _LOCATION_ .
high levels of exogenous suc or glc prevent the majority of wild type arabidopsis seedlings from developing green expanded cotyledons and true leaves . in contrast equimolar concentrations of sorbitol do not exert this effect indicating that the inhibitory effects of high sugar levels on early seedling development are not solely due to osmotic stress . the ability of high sugar levels to inhibit early seedling development has been used to identify mutations that alter seedling sensitivity to sugars . in one such screen performed by our lab approximately seeds derived from an ethyl methanesulfonate _METHOD_ mutagenized arabidopsis thaliana var . col population were screened to identify seedlings that are resistant to m suc . the mutants identified via this screen are also resistant to high concentrations of glc and so were designated sugar insensitive or sis mutants . cloning and characterization of one of these mutants the mutant is described below . the mutant which is in the col background was backcrossed to the col wild type . the resulting seedlings exhibit a wild type response to m suc indicating that the mutant 's sugar insensitive phenotype is recessive . to initiate map based cloning of _PROTEIN_ was crossed to wild type plants of the hi o background . progeny of this cross were screened on media containing or m suc . those seedlings that displayed a sis mutant phenotype were used to form a mapping population of plants . fine scale mapping localized _PROTEIN_ to a kb region on bacterial artificial chromosome clone that contains four genes . dna spanning the entire kb region was isolated from by pcr and fully sequenced . this sequencing revealed the presence of only a single point mutation within the kb region shown to contain the _PROTEIN_ gene . this point mutation causes a c to t transition at position in the genomic dna of _GENE_ . _GENE_ is predicted to encode a putative plant raf family mapkkk involved in salt tolerance . the mutation causes an amino acid change of proline to serine at position in exon which lies within the predicted kinase domain . to test whether _GENE_ is the _PROTEIN_ gene three independent lines carrying t dna insertions in _GENE_ were obtained from the arabidopsis biological resource center _PROTEIN_ . quantitative rt pcr analyses revealed that each of these t dna insertions disrupts production of full length _PROTEIN_ mrna . these mutants were renamed as and . testing revealed that all of these mutants display significant resistance to high concentrations of suc and glc . in contrast and wild type seedlings exhibit similar morphologies when grown on media containing equimolar concentrations of sorbitol . a complementation test was performed to test further whether _GENE_ corresponds to the _PROTEIN_ gene . a kb genomic dna fragment from _GENE_ including the predicted kb promoter was cloned into the gateway destination vector _GENE_ and used to transform via the floral dip method . seeds from a homozygous transgenic line were used in qrt pcr and sugar response assays . the _PROTEIN_ level of _PROTEIN_ in the complementation line is approximately twice that of col wild type . the complementation line is not resistant to m suc or glc further indicating that _GENE_ is the _PROTEIN_ gene . the function of _PROTEIN_ in sugar response was further investigated in _PROTEIN_ overexpression lines . the _PROTEIN_ coding region was placed under the control of the camv promoter and introduced into col wild type plants . three independent homozygous transgenic lines were recovered and qrt pcr analysis revealed overexpression of the _PROTEIN_ transcript in all three lines . the _PROTEIN_ overexpression lines exhibit a hypersensitive response to the inhibitory effects of m glc or suc on early seedling development when compared with wild type plants . the _PROTEIN_ overexpression lines also exhibit slightly lower rates of seed germination cotyledon expansion and true leaf formation than wild type plants when grown on medium supplemented with m sorbitol but these effects are substantially smaller than the effects of m glc or suc . as some previously characterized sugar response mutants also exhibit defects in aba or gibberellin response the mutants were tested for aberrant response to aba and ga . seeds of mutant and wild type plants were sterilized stratified and sown on minimal medium containing the indicated concentrations of aba or paclobutrazol and scored for percentage germination after days . when assayed on media lacking both aba and paclobutrazol high percentages of seeds from all of the lines germinated . when sown on media supplemented with aba and seeds exhibit germination percentages that are not significantly different from wild type seeds . similarly when assayed on paclobutrazol and seeds exhibit germination rates that are similar to those of wild type seeds . the wild type germination responses of the seeds to aba and ga are in agreement with the observations of gao and xiang . semi quantitative rt pcr was performed to determine the relative _PROTEIN_ levels of _PROTEIN_ in different arabidopsis organs . _PROTEIN_ transcript was detected in diverse organs of arabidopsis including roots _METHOD_ leaves siliques and flowers with higher _PROTEIN_ in leaves . our data were compared with microarray data compiled by genevestigator . according to genevestigator _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ ubiquitously in all major organ and tissue types tested with higher _PROTEIN_ levels found in leaves . a developmental _PROTEIN_ profile reveals that _PROTEIN_ mrna is present at slightly higher levels at the seedling stage than in germinated seeds with mature siliques having the lowest levels of _PROTEIN_ . analysis of stimulus response data compiled by genevestigator indicates that _PROTEIN_ mrna levels are two to three fold lower on aba and two fold lower on naa a synthetic auxin analog but are increased nearly three fold by heat stress and fold by brassinolide application suggesting that _PROTEIN_ is affected by plant hormone signaling and abiotic stress responses . interestingly salt treatment caused a _PROTEIN_ in levels of _PROTEIN_ mrna in seedlings . to investigate whether glc levels affect _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in germinating seeds qrt pcr experiments were conducted . the results of these experiments indicate that _PROTEIN_ transcript levels are not substantially affected by glc treatment in germinating seeds . to determine whether _PROTEIN_ regulates the _PROTEIN_ of genes involved in different sugar response pathways germinating seeds of and wild type col were treated with m suc or sorbitol and transcript levels determined by qrt pcr . the genes analyzed include components of the hexokinase dependent pathway _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ pathway _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and the pathway _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . levels of _PROTEIN_ transcript are higher in seeds germinating on m glc or sorbitol than in wild type seeds germinating on the same media and _PROTEIN_ transcript levels are higher in seeds germinating on m glc than in wild type seeds germinating on m glc . however the effects of the mutation on _PROTEIN_ of these genes are quite small with a maximum difference in transcript levels between the mutant and wild type of less than . the system has been used extensively for detecting protein protein interactions . yeast two hybrid screening was conducted at the molecular interaction facility at the university of wisconsin madison using the _PROTEIN_ protein as bait and proteins generated from random arabidopsis cdnas as prey . six possible _PROTEIN_ interacting proteins were identified . the interactions of each of the six prey constructs and the _PROTEIN_ bait construct in yeast were retested in vivo . the results of these assays indicate that each of the prey constructs produces a fusion protein that gives a positive interaction with the fusion protein produced by the _PROTEIN_ bait construct . furthermore none of the prey constructs gives a positive result with the empty bait construct indicating that a positive interaction is dependent on production of a _PROTEIN_ fusion protein . _PROTEIN_ arabidopsis genome initiative . the sugar insensitive phenotype was characterized by assaying at least one homozygous t dna insertion line for each gene . the identities of the genes encoding the six putative _PROTEIN_ interacting proteins are listed in table . the protein that shows the strongest interaction with _PROTEIN_ in the assays is _PROTEIN_ a udp _PROTEIN_ glycosyltransferase that specifically conjugates lignin monomers such as coniferyl aldehyde and sinapyl aldehyde . to test the interaction between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ a co localization study was performed . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were fused with _METHOD_ proteins and transiently _PROTEIN_ in tobacco leaves . a previously reported _LOCATION_ protein _PROTEIN_ was used as a positive control . signals from _METHOD_ proteins clearly demonstrate that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are targeted to the _LOCATION_ . to visualize the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ interaction in living plant cells the bifc technique which has been used successfully for visualization of protein protein interactions was adopted . _PROTEIN_ was cloned into the split _METHOD_ vector puc _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ was cloned into puc _PROTEIN_ . mixtures of agrobacteria carrying the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ constructs were co transformed into tobacco leaves . epidermal cells _PROTEIN_ both constructs show yellow _METHOD_ in the _LOCATION_ confirming the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ protein protein interaction and its _LOCATION_ localization . the _PROTEIN_ protein was used as a positive control and exhibits a yellow _METHOD_ signal in the _LOCATION_ . to determine whether mutations in the genes encoding potential _PROTEIN_ interacting proteins cause a sugar insensitive phenotype t dna insertion lines predicted to carry inserts in four of the six genes were obtained from the _PROTEIN_ . seeds from lines homozygous for each insertion were screened on m suc to test for a hypersensitive response and on m glc to test for a glc resistant phenotype . interestingly _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ which carry t dna inserts in _PROTEIN_ display sugar insensitive phenotypes . when grown on medium supplemented with m suc both homozygous _PROTEIN_ mutant lines display rates of cotyledon expansion and true leaf formation that are significantly higher than those of wild type seedlings grown on the same medium . in contrast when grown on minimal medium with no sugar supplement the _PROTEIN_ lines develop expanded cotyledons and true leaves at rates similar to wild type plants grown on the same medium . the _PROTEIN_ lines also exhibit wild type sensitivity to the effects of m sorbitol and m nacl on early seedling development . _PROTEIN_ transcript levels are not regulated by m glc in germinating seeds . similarly the mutation does not significantly affect _PROTEIN_ transcript levels in germinating seeds .

tccaagagcccattttcgat _PROTEIN_ cagcaggttcttcgctgttg and _PROTEIN_ . for qrt pcr experiments two technical replicates were performed for each biological replicate and data were normalized by comparison with _PROTEIN_ or the geometric average of and _PROTEIN_ as indicated for each experiment . to generate the mapping population seedlings from a cross between and wild type plants of the hi background

molecular interaction facility at the university of wisconsin madison where the screen was performed . the _PROTEIN_ gene was cloned into the pbute vector to produce a hybrid gene encoding a _PROTEIN_ dna binding domain fusion protein . the prey constructs were generated using the rec vector into which arabidopsis cdnas were inserted to create a library that produces fusion proteins consisting of

identification of six genes that give a reproducible positive interaction signal in the presence of the construct encoding the _PROTEIN_ bd fusion protein but not in the presence of the empty vector construct which encodes only the bd . to retest the results of the screen each positive prey plasmid was introduced into yeast strains carrying pbute with or without the _PROTEIN_ insert using the lithium acetate method . single transformants were picked and grown on synthetic complete leu ura ade plates to detect protein protein interactions which result in growth of white colonies . to
