plants accumulate large amounts of storage products in seeds to provide an energy reserve and to supply nutrients for germination and post germinative growth . arabidopsis thaliana belongs to the brassica family and oil is the _PROTEIN_ storage product in arabidopsis seeds . to elucidate the regulatory _METHOD_ of oil biosynthesis in seeds we screened for high density seeds that have a low oil content . _PROTEIN_ encodes the dead box rna helicase that is localized to _LOCATION_ . the triacylglycerol content of seeds was lower than that of wild type seeds while the protein content was unchanged . the plants displayed a pale green phenotype in developing seeds and seedlings but not in adult leaves . the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ level was high in developing seeds and seedlings but was low in _METHOD_ rosette leaves and flowers . the _LOCATION_ gene _PROTEIN_ profile of wt developing seeds and seedlings differed from that of developing seeds and seedlings . the _PROTEIN_ of several genes was reduced in developing seeds including _PROTEIN_ a gene that encodes the subunit of _PROTEIN_ which is one component of acetyl coa _PROTEIN_ in _LOCATION_ . in contrast no differences were observed between the _PROTEIN_ profiles of wt and rosette leaves . these results show that _PROTEIN_ is essential for proper mrna accumulation of _LOCATION_ genes during seed development and seedling growth and suggest that _PROTEIN_ ensures seed oil biosynthesis by _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ mrna levels .
arabidopsis thaliana seeds contain stores of oil and protein . the densities of oil and protein differ greatly the density of oil is approximately and the density of protein is generally > . the relative proportions of oil and protein determine the seed density and density gradient centrifugation can therefore be used to screen for mutant seeds that have altered oil/protein ratios . we screened for high density seeds which have a low oil content using percoll based density gradient centrifugation which permits the detection of minor but significant differences in density . three heavy seed mutants were isolated and this study was conducted using plants . the mutant was identified from pools of t dna insertion lines . the seed density was higher than that of wild type seeds . the tag content of seeds was lower than that of wt seeds while the protein content was the same . in addition the seeds were smaller than the wt seeds and the average weight of the seeds was less than that of the wt seeds . these results indicate that the mutant produces seeds with reduced oil content and suggest that tag accumulation is affected in seeds . tag is the _PROTEIN_ oil stored in arabidopsis seeds and the fatty acids used in the tags are produced in _LOCATION_ . the tag content of developing seeds was less than that of wt seeds while the transcript level of _PROTEIN_ which encodes a key enzyme in fatty acid oxidation in _LOCATION_ was unchanged . the seed protein content was unchanged . additionally the embryos were pale green compared with wt embryos at both days after flowering _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and the chl content of seeds was significantly lower than wt at both and _PROTEIN_ . the growth of plants was also investigated . while seeds germinated normally day old seedlings were pale green and the cotyledons were smaller and the roots were shorter than those of the wt . the growth defects in plants were also observed when plants were cultured without sucrose . although the day old seedlings were still pale green and smaller than those of the wt the day old plants had recovered a phenotype similar to the wt and the d old plants were equal in size to the wt plants . the chl content of the and day old seedlings was significantly lower than that of the wt but the chl content of and day old plants was equivalent to that of the wt . electron microscopy revealed that wt cotyledons displayed well developed _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and starch accumulation in _LOCATION_ while the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ of the cotyledons were underdeveloped and starch accumulation was markedly reduced . these results indicate that _PROTEIN_ is essential for _LOCATION_ functions during seed development and seedling growth . to identify the gene responsible for the t dna position in the genome was determined by tail pcr . the t dna was inserted into the sixth intron of the _GENE_ gene in the genome and introducing a _PROTEIN_ dna fragment into plants rescued the pale green phenotype . alleles of and were obtained from the arabidopsis biological resource center _PROTEIN_ and the positions of the t dna insertions were identified . insertions of the t dna in the and genomes were confirmed by pcr . the full length _PROTEIN_ transcript was _PROTEIN_ in wt plants but _PROTEIN_ was reduced in plants and absent in plants . the end of the transcript including the first exon was detected in wt and plants . transcripts containing exons were detected in both wt and plants and transcripts containing exons were detected in wt plants and at low levels in plants . these results indicate that does not produce a full length _PROTEIN_ transcript and that the level of full length transcripts is reduced in mutants . indeed the pale green phenotype of day old seedlings was weaker than that of seedlings . in addition we were unable to obtain homozygous mutants and approximately of the seeds in siliques were aborted seeds in which embryogenesis was arrested at the globular stage . these results demonstrate that sufficient levels of full length _PROTEIN_ transcripts are required for seed development and seedling growth and that a null mutation of _PROTEIN_ produces an embryonic lethal phenotype . the amino acid sequence of _PROTEIN_ obtained from the arabidopsis information resource contained a dead like helicase superfamily domain and _PROTEIN_ green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ was localized in _LOCATION_ . rna helicases play a number of roles in rna metabolism and are primarily involved in mrna regulation . _PROTEIN_ transcripts were strongly detected in and day old seedlings and seeds harvested at _PROTEIN_ . to elucidate the function of _PROTEIN_ the transcript levels of _LOCATION_ genes from wt and plants as well as plants overexpressing _PROTEIN_ were analyzed by quantitative reverse transcription pcr . in developing seeds harvested at _PROTEIN_ the transcript levels of _LOCATION_ genes were less than half of wt levels . in contrast the transcript levels of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ which are involved in seed development but are encoded in the _LOCATION_ genome were unchanged . in day old seedlings the transcript levels of nine _LOCATION_ genes were over less than that of wt seedlings while the transcript levels of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ which regulate epidermal cell differentiation in seedlings but are encoded by the _LOCATION_ genome were unchanged . the transcript levels of all _LOCATION_ genes were equivalent in leaves from day old wt and plants . no differences in transcript levels of the genes were detected in oe developing seeds harvested at _PROTEIN_ as well as day old seedlings and day old leaves . additionally there were no phenotypic differences in the developing seeds seedlings or plants between wt plants and plants overexpressing _PROTEIN_ . to determine whether _PROTEIN_ affects replication of the _LOCATION_ genome the genome copy number was measured . the _LOCATION_ genome copy number was unchanged in developing seeds _PROTEIN_ and in day old seedlings relative to the wt . these data indicate that _PROTEIN_ does not affect the replication of the _LOCATION_ genome but is involved in mrna accumulation of _LOCATION_ genes .
