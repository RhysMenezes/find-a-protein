histone acetylation is modulated through the action of histone acetyltransferases and deacetylases which play key roles in the regulation of eukaryotic gene _PROTEIN_ . previously we have identified a yeast histone deacetylase reduced potassium _PROTEIN_ homolog histone _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis thaliana . here we report further study of the _PROTEIN_ and function of _PROTEIN_ . analysis of arabidopsis plants containing the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ fusion gene revealed that _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ throughout the life of the plant and in most plant organs examined . in addition the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ was induced by wounding the pathogen alternaria brassicicola and the plant hormones jasmonic acid and ethylene . using green _METHOD_ protein fusion we demonstrated that _PROTEIN_ accumulated in the _LOCATION_ of arabidopsis cells . overexpression of _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ plants _PROTEIN_ histone acetylation levels whereas downregulation of _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ rna interference plants increased histone acetylation levels . in comparison with wild type plants _PROTEIN_ transgenic plants had increased _PROTEIN_ of ethylene response _PROTEIN_ and were more resistant to the pathogen a. brassicicola . the _PROTEIN_ of jasmonic acid and ethylene regulated _PROTEIN_ related genes basic chitinase and _PROTEIN_ was upregulated in _PROTEIN_ plants but downregulated in _PROTEIN_ rnai plants . our studies provide evidence that _PROTEIN_ may regulate gene _PROTEIN_ involved in jasmonic acid and ethylene signaling of pathogen response in arabidopsis .
a kb _PROTEIN_ promoter fragment was used to construct a gus reporter gene fusion _PROTEIN_ for stable transformation of arabidopsis . in week old transgenic seedlings high levels of gus _PROTEIN_ were observed in all parts of the seedlings . in adult plants gus _PROTEIN_ was detected in the mature leaves _METHOD_ flowers siliques and seeds . in developing or mature flowers the gus activity was detected in all parts of the flowers including the sepal style and stamens . as shown in the figure the gus reporter gene under the control of the _PROTEIN_ promoter was strongly induced by ja and aminocyclopropane _PROTEIN_ acid . furthermore infections with the necrotrophic pathogen a. brassicicola induced gus _PROTEIN_ at the sites of infection by the pathogen . in many of the tissues shown in figure gus _PROTEIN_ was induced by wounding of the tissues at the sites of excision . this was examined more carefully as shown in figure . gus driven by the _PROTEIN_ promoter was shown to be wound inducible and limited to the cells at the actual wound site . we further analyzed the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ by rt pcr . as shown in figure _PROTEIN_ mrna accumulated in the presence of ja and acc . in addition to _PROTEIN_ three other homologs of yeast _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were also identified in the arabidopsis genome . we compared the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ with other type hdac genes in arabidopsis . like _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ can also be induced by ethylene and ja . the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ however can not be induced . we could not detect the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ by rt pcr . these data suggest that there is differential _PROTEIN_ among type hdac genes in arabidopsis . furthermore the _PROTEIN_ of members of _PROTEIN_ type hdacs _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ as well as an _PROTEIN_ type hdac _PROTEIN_ can not be induced by ethylene and ja . to investigate the cellular distribution of _PROTEIN_ we performed an in vivo targeting experiment using green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ gene fusion was created and introduced into arabidopsis under the promoter to achieve high levels of constitutive _PROTEIN_ . to confirm that the fusion protein entered the _LOCATION_ we monitored the _METHOD_ of _METHOD_ at the cellular level . protoplasts were isolated from seedlings of transgenic arabidopsis and localization of the fusion protein was determined by _METHOD_ microscopy . as shown in figure the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein was localized in the _LOCATION_ of the arabidopsis cells . transgenic arabidopsis plants were developed that overexpressed _PROTEIN_ from the constitutive promoter of cauliflower mosaic virus . pcr and dna gel blot analysis were performed to determine the integration of transgenes into the genome in transgenic plants . the three _PROTEIN_ transgenic lines _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ showed significantly increased levels of _PROTEIN_ mrna accumulation compared with wild type plants . overexpression of _PROTEIN_ cdna in arabidopsis resulted in an assortment of pleiotropic developmental abnormalities including aberrant cotyledons abnormal leaves delayed flowering and reduced fertility . we further analyzed two _PROTEIN_ rnai lines rnai and rnai generated by _PROTEIN_ a transgene that encodes double stranded _PROTEIN_ rna . rna gel blots revealed significantly reduced _PROTEIN_ mrna levels in the _PROTEIN_ rnai plants relative to nontransgenic control plants . _PROTEIN_ rnai plants were vigorous and displayed phenotypes similar to the _PROTEIN_ antisense plants and t dna insertion plants described previously . the levels of tetra acetylated in wild type _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ rnai plants were analyzed by protein gel blot analysis . as shown in figure there were obviously _PROTEIN_ levels of tetra acetylated in three _PROTEIN_ transgenic lines compared with the wild type . by comparison the levels of tetra acetylated in two _PROTEIN_ rnai lines were increased suggesting that _PROTEIN_ transcript level affects histone acetylation levels globally . our protein gel blot analysis indicated that the anti tetra acetylated antibody was specific to the histone because we were able to detect only one protein band with molecular _METHOD_ of kd corresponding to . changed levels of tetra acetylated in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ rnai plants indicated that _PROTEIN_ has hdac activity . the finding that _PROTEIN_ can be induced by ja and ethylene prompted us to test whether changed _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ levels could affect ja and ethylene regulated gene _PROTEIN_ . it has been demonstrated that ja and ethylene coregulate the _PROTEIN_ of a subset of pr genes such as basic chitinase _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . rt pcr analyses indicated that the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ b and bgl was increased in the _PROTEIN_ plants . by contrast the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ b and bgl was _PROTEIN_ in the _PROTEIN_ rnai plants . these data indicate that there is a correlation between _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and the _PROTEIN_ of these pr genes . recent studies indicate that the transcriptional _PROTEIN_ ethylene response _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ acts downstream of the interaction between the ethylene and ja pathways and is a key element in the integration of both signals for the regulation of defense response genes . rt pcr analysis indicated that the _PROTEIN_ of _LOCATION_ was upregulated in the _PROTEIN_ plants suggesting that overexpression of _PROTEIN_ induced _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ . we also analyzed the _PROTEIN_ of the marker genes of the wound response _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . as shown in figure no difference was found in the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ rnai plants compared with the wild type suggesting that _PROTEIN_ does not affect the _PROTEIN_ of these wound inducible genes . it has been demonstrated that ja induces two groups of genes regulated by different _METHOD_ . the first group including pr genes which are involved in defense responses against pathogens is activated by _LOCATION_ the second group including _PROTEIN_ integrated by genes involved in ja mediated systemic responses to wounding is activated by another transcriptional _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . our analyses indicate that _PROTEIN_ can modulate the _PROTEIN_ of the first group of genes involved in defense response but may not affect the second group of genes involved in wound response . we further compared the susceptibility of wild type _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ rnai transgenic plants to the necrotrophic pathogen a. brassicicola . four week old plants grown in soil were _PROTEIN_ with a suspension containing spores of a. brassicicola and the progress of the infection was followed . compared with wild type plants _PROTEIN_ plants showed a clear reduction in the _METHOD_ of infection whereas _PROTEIN_ rnai plants displayed an increase in _METHOD_ . these results demonstrate that _PROTEIN_ is required for resistance to a. brassicicola and that overexpression of _PROTEIN_ is sufficient to increase resistance to this necrotrophic fungus .
