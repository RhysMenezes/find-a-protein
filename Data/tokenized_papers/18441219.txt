purine metabolism is crucial in living cells and involves three complex pathways in plants the de novo synthesis the salvage and the degradation pathways . the relative importance of each pathway in plant development and reproduction however is still unclear . we identified two t dna insertions in the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ gene that encodes formylglycinamidine ribonucleotide synthase the fourth enzyme in the de novo purine biosynthesis pathway . the mutated alleles were never transmitted through the pollen of heterozygous plants but could be inherited through the female gametophyte indicating that de novo purine synthesis is specifically necessary for pollen development . because the _PROTEIN_ mutations were lethal to the male gametophyte homozygous _PROTEIN_ plants could not be obtained . however the reproductive phenotype of hetererozygous plants carrying the _PROTEIN_ mutated allele was more severe than that carrying the _PROTEIN_ mutated allele and _PROTEIN_ plants showed slightly delayed early development . we showed that the _PROTEIN_ allele produces an antisense transcript and that the amount of _PROTEIN_ mrna is reduced in these plants . transient _PROTEIN_ of a translational fusion with the green _METHOD_ protein in arabidopsis plantlets showed that the formylglycinamidine ribonucleotide synthase protein is dually targeted to chloroplast and mitochondria suggesting that at least some steps of the de novo purine biosynthesis pathway can take place in both organelles in arabidopsis a dual location previously thought to be a peculiarity of ureide forming tropical legumes .
in a study aimed at identifying mutations that affect genes encoding proteins targeted to mitochondria or _LOCATION_ and impaired in sexual reproduction we identified two mutations in the _PROTEIN_ gene . _PROTEIN_ in the columbia genotype was obtained from the joe ecker t dna insertional mutant collection _PROTEIN_ was previously identified in the wassilewskija genotype by a screen designed to isolate gametophytic lethal mutations . we determined the complete sequence of the _PROTEIN_ mrna by sequencing overlapping amplification products from the cdna and performing and _PROTEIN_ experiments . we detected a previously unreported intron in the untranslated region of the gene and determined the and ends of the mrna . the resulting sequence is aligned with the genomic sequence in supplemental figure . the _PROTEIN_ gene structure is presented in figure showing the positions of the t dna insertions in the two mutant alleles . we analyzed both mutations by dna hybridization analyses and sequencing . the _PROTEIN_ t dna insertion is complex but its flanking sequence was confirmed by sequencing . the _PROTEIN_ t dna insertion is simple and was confirmed by sequencing the and flanking regions . in both cases dna hybridization showed that no other copy of the t dna was present in the plants carrying the mutated alleles since the nptii probe on ecori digestions gave only one hybridization signal for both insertions . the selfed progeny of hemizygous plants from both t dna lines was screened for the t dna insertion either on kanamycin containing medium or by direct pcr genotyping . plants homozygous for the _PROTEIN_ mutations were never recovered for either allele . the transmission efficiency of both mutations in selfed plants is shown in figure . the transmission rate of both mutant alleles was dramatically lower than expected for a mendelian trait . two types of mutations result in lower transmission rates in selfed progeny and the absence of homozygous mutants embryo lethal mutations which are transmitted to two thirds of the viable progeny because of the loss of homozygous mutants and gametophyte lethal mutations which are transmitted to only half of the progeny because of the loss of either the male or the female gametes carrying the mutation . if the mutation is lethal for both gametes it is not transmitted to offspring and is completely lost . we found that the _PROTEIN_ mutations were transmitted even less efficiently than expected for a gametophyte lethal mutation and that the _PROTEIN_ allele was transmitted less efficiently than the _PROTEIN_ allele . these results suggest that at least one of the two gametophytes is unable to transmit the mutated _PROTEIN_ alleles . in order to determine the cause of this transmission deficiency more precisely we made reciprocal crosses with wild type plants . when the _PROTEIN_ plants were used as pollen donors none of the resulting progeny carried either of the _PROTEIN_ mutations showing that the male gametophyte could not transmit the _PROTEIN_ mutations . we conclude that the _PROTEIN_ mutations are male gametophyte lethal . following crosses using the _PROTEIN_ plants as the female parent the two mutations were recovered although often in less than half of the progeny . therefore we suspect that the _PROTEIN_ mutations also have an effect on the female gametophyte . results of reciprocal crosses between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ plants and wild type plants overall the transmission of the _PROTEIN_ mutant alleles was analyzed in progeny from _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ individual plants . although all were heterozygous the kanamycin resistant plantlets carrying the _PROTEIN_ mutation showed delayed germination and early development _PROTEIN_ of whether they resulted from selfing or outcrossing or were produced by _PROTEIN_ plants _METHOD_ issued from selfing or backcrossing . in addition the germination efficiency of seeds from _PROTEIN_ plants was extremely variable and often quite poor whether produced by selfing or outcrossing or from plants _METHOD_ originating from selfing or backcrossing . sometimes a few _PROTEIN_ plantlets appeared to be chlorotic . the proportion of these pale plants in progeny was variable between individual progenies . when transferred to the greenhouse pale plants grew slowly but finally reached the reproductive stage and set seeds at roughly the same time as wild type siblings . all of the plants carrying the _PROTEIN_ mutation were indistinguishable from wild type plants . we observed that _PROTEIN_ plants issued either from selfing or backcrossing had smaller anthers and produced less pollen than _PROTEIN_ or wild type plants . we alexander stained and examined pollen in mature anthers of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ plants issued from backcrosses and scored viable or aborted pollen grains . in both wild type controls no aborted pollen was observed . in _PROTEIN_ plants however half of the pollen was aborted and because the mutation is not transmitted through pollen we inferred that the dead pollen carries the _PROTEIN_ mutation . in _PROTEIN_ anthers more than half of the pollen had aborted . we concluded that some of the pollen grains carrying the wild type _PROTEIN_ allele also died in the _PROTEIN_ background . we carried out further cytological observations on anthers from _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ plants issued from backcrosses in order to define the precise stage at which pollen development is impaired . in both heterozygous genotypes pollen development was indistinguishable from that of the wild type until the vacuolated microspore stage . in buds with a mm pistil corresponding to pollen mitosis i or soon after we observed poorly stained cytoplasm and a remaining large _LOCATION_ in a large proportion of pollen grains in both heterozygous genotypes . in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ buds with a mm pistil corresponding to pollen mitosis ii or soon after about half of the pollen grains had almost completely collapsed . in addition in _PROTEIN_ anthers some of the remaining normally shaped pollen grains also showed poorly stained cytoplasm . again the proportion of these poorly stained pollen grains was variable among _PROTEIN_ plants . next we stained mature pollen with diamino phenylindole and found that some of the nonaborted pollen grains in _PROTEIN_ anthers had abnormal _LOCATION_ numbers suggesting impaired pollen mitoses . finally we scored the number of fully developed seeds and the number of empty spaces in mature siliques of plants issued from backcrosses . the results are shown in fig . . both heterozygous mutants showed lower seed set than their wild type siblings . again the phenotype was more severe for the _PROTEIN_ allele . we analyzed the _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ gene in _PROTEIN_ plants issued from selfing compared with wild type plants by performing quantitative reverse transcription pcr analyses on total rna from different organs . in all organs the _PROTEIN_ mrna was accumulated at less than of the wild type level in _PROTEIN_ plants . we repeated quantitative rt pcr analysis on plantlets issued from the backcross . results of the _PROTEIN_ level of _PROTEIN_ in several individual plants are shown in figure . we observed that pur plantlets accumulated between and of the amount of _PROTEIN_ mrna found in their wild type siblings . seedlings carrying the _PROTEIN_ mutation accumulated approximately of the wild type level of _PROTEIN_ mrna . the low level of _PROTEIN_ mrna in _PROTEIN_ plants suggests that the accumulation of the _PROTEIN_ transcript is affected by a suppression mechanism in these plants . a possible explanation could be that an aberrant rna is produced from the mutated allele leading to a _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ transcript . to test this hypothesis we performed rt pcr experiments with primers allowing the detection of sense and antisense transcripts in plants issued from the backcross . the results are shown in figure b and c. the sense transcript originating from the _PROTEIN_ allele was detected in both _PROTEIN_ and wild type plants . oppositely we detected an antisense transcript only in _PROTEIN_ plants . a partial sequence of the _PROTEIN_ specific antisense rna was obtained by sequencing several rt pcr products . alignment of the resulting sequences with the _PROTEIN_ gene and the t dna sequences is shown in supplemental figure . we conclude that the _PROTEIN_ allele produces an antisense chimeric transcript overlapping the _PROTEIN_ and t dna sequences which may interfere with _PROTEIN_ mrna accumulation . the enzymes for de novo purine synthesis are predicted to be targeted to _LOCATION_ and the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ which catalyzes the first step of the pathway was shown to be present in chloroplasts . however in tropical legumes this pathway was localized to both mitochondria and _LOCATION_ . therefore we decided to investigate the subcellular localization of the _PROTEIN_ protein in arabidopsis . we constructed a translational fusion between the first amino acid residues of the _PROTEIN_ protein and the _METHOD_ under the control of the promoter using gateway technology . the resulting chimeric gene possesses the entire utr of the _PROTEIN_ gene . transient _PROTEIN_ experiments were performed in nicotiana benthamiana leaves and arabidopsis plantlets via agrobacterium infiltration using the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ resulting vector and a vector _PROTEIN_ a potato formate dehydrogenase _PROTEIN_ fusion known to be targeted to mitochondria . figure shows an example of the typically observed patterns in arabidopsis adaxial cotyledon cells . both _METHOD_ and signals exhibited very similar distribution patterns in cells and could be superposed in an overlay . both signals colocalized in optical sections indicating that both proteins are targeted to the same organelles . optical sections also revealed that the _METHOD_ signal in _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ cells was also visible in the chloroplasts identified by the _METHOD_ of the chlorophyll . these results strongly suggest that the arabidopsis _METHOD_ is localized to both organelles as shown previously for other enzymes of the de novo purine biosynthesis pathway of legumes .
