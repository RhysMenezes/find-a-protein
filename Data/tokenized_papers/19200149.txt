profilin is an protein that shows complex effects on the dynamics of the actin _LOCATION_ . there are five profilin _METHOD_ in arabidopsis thaliana l. however it is still an open question whether these _METHOD_ are functionally different . in the present study two profilin _METHOD_ from arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were fused with green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ tag and _PROTEIN_ in escherichia coli and a. thaliana in order to compare their biochemical properties in vitro and their cellular distributions in vivo . biochemical analysis revealed that fusion proteins of _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ can bind to and showing remarkable differences . _METHOD_ has much higher affinities for both and compared with _METHOD_ . observations of living cells in stable transgenic a. thaliana lines revealed that _METHOD_ formed a filamentous network while _METHOD_ formed polygonal meshes . results from the treatment with latrunculin a and a subsequent recovery experiment indicated that filamentous alignment of _METHOD_ was likely associated with actin filaments . however _METHOD_ localized to polygonal meshes resembling the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . our results provide evidence that arabidopsis profilin _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ have different biochemical affinities for and and show distinctive localizations in living cells . these data suggest that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are functionally different _METHOD_ .
in order to characterize the two profilin _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ from arabidopsis fusion constructs of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ tagged with _METHOD_ were cloned into plasmid and _PROTEIN_ in e. coli strain to obtain the fusion proteins and analyze their biochemical properties . the fusion proteins of _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ were purified on _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ column . different elution buffers were applied for the two fusion proteins . the commonly used elution buffer was used for the purification of _METHOD_ but replaced by buffer i for the purification of _METHOD_ fusion protein because of the weaker association of _METHOD_ to _PROTEIN_ . high purity of fusion _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ were obtained after the purification . before transformation of fusion genes _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ into arabidopsis we examined the binding activities of the two fusion proteins to determine whether the properties of these two profilin _METHOD_ are affected by the _METHOD_ tag and if there are any differences in binding activities between the two profilin _METHOD_ . binding and depolymerization assays were carried out to analyze the binding activities of the two fusion proteins to and . the kd values of _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ for _PROTEIN_ were determined by scatchard plot analysis and also by analysis of tryptophan _METHOD_ enhancement . the kd values determined by scatchard plot analysis for _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ were and respectively . the values were quite different from those found with _METHOD_ enhancement and . the differences may come from different methods and this is consistent with the result reported by gibbon et al . . but no matter which measurement method was used the kd value of _METHOD_ for _PROTEIN_ was significantly lower than that of _METHOD_ indicating that _METHOD_ had much higher affinity for _PROTEIN_ than _METHOD_ . to test if _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ have different affinities for the kd values of each fusion proteins for monomeric rabbit skeletal muscle was calculated by measuring the shift of critical concentration in the steady state for actin assembly in the presence of _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ respectively . light scattering measurement results showed that the average apparent kd value from several experiments was for _METHOD_ and for _METHOD_ . the value for _METHOD_ was significantly lower than that for _METHOD_ . therefore although both fusion proteins _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ have the ability of binding and _METHOD_ has a much higher affinity than _METHOD_ . in addition the binding affinities of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ to both _PROTEIN_ and actin was analyzed to find out if fusion of _METHOD_ affects the binding of the proteins . as shown in the supporting information the fusion of _METHOD_ slightly changed their binding affinities to _PROTEIN_ and actin but the differences between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were not changed dramatically . therefore the _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ in arabidopsis cells is feasible for indicating the localization of these two profilin _METHOD_ in living cells . the differences in binding activities between _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ imply that these two profilin _METHOD_ may have different functions in cells . to further address this question we generated transgenic lines of arabidopsis overexpressing _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ respectively . in order to reveal the localizations of these two profilin _METHOD_ in living cells various types of cells of _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ transgenic arabidopsis were observed by using confocal laser scanning microscopy . the observation revealed that the distributions of _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ fusion proteins in arabidopsis cells were different . figure shows the localizations of _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ fusion proteins in leaf epidermal cells trichomes and stem epidermal cells respectively . in these various types of arabidopsis cells _METHOD_ fusion protein exhibited filamentous distribution but _METHOD_ formed polygonal meshes . both fusion proteins were associated with moving organelles resembling vesicles . the filamentous distribution of _METHOD_ suggested that _METHOD_ might associate with cytoplasmic actin filaments while the polygonal localization of _METHOD_ imitated a structure of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . in order to investigate whether the filamentous or polygonal localization of _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ is dependent on the actin _LOCATION_ we treated the transgenic arabidopsis leaves _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ with latrunculin a an actin drug preventing actin polymerization thus disrupting the actin _LOCATION_ . arabidopsis transformed with _METHOD_ was used as a reporter construct for visualization of actin filaments . according to the observations made on the _METHOD_ line of arabidospis treatment with lat a for h resulted in depolymerization of the majority of the actin _LOCATION_ while only some actin speckles were left . before the lat a treatment _METHOD_ in cells showed a filamentous distribution pattern which was similar to the cytoplasmic actin _LOCATION_ . however at the same conditions of lat a treatment as in the _METHOD_ transgenic arabidopsis line filamentous _METHOD_ dispersed into speckles in cells of the _METHOD_ transgenic line . upon removal of lat a new actin filaments were formed over a period of h as visualized by the _METHOD_ reporter construct . correspondingly filamentous _METHOD_ organization was also partially recovered suggesting that filamentous localization of _METHOD_ is associated with the cytoplasmic actin filaments . on the other hand _METHOD_ formed polygonal meshes in leaf epidermal cells of the _METHOD_ transgenic arabidopsis line . treatment with lat a at the same conditions increased _METHOD_ localization to meshes and induced formation of lamellar sheets . such rearrangement is very similar to the previously reported _LOCATION_ pattern in plant cells . _METHOD_ aggregated further to surround organelles after the removal of lat a and the polygonal _METHOD_ distribution was always persistent . our experimental results suggested that is likely associated with cytoplasmic actin filaments while is presumably associated with the _LOCATION_ in living leaf epidermal cells of arabidopsis .
