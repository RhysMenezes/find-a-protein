sulfate transporters in plants and animals are structurally conserved and have an amino terminal domain that functions in transport and a _PROTEIN_ terminal region that has been designated the _PROTEIN_ domain . the _PROTEIN_ domain in sulfate transporters has significant similarity to bacterial anti sigma _PROTEIN_ antagonists . to determine if the _PROTEIN_ domain has a role in controlling the activity of sulfate transporters their stability or their localization to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ we examined the effect of deleting or modifying the _PROTEIN_ domain of dominant sulfate transporters in roots of arabidopsis thaliana . the a. thaliana and sulfate transporters rescue the methionine dependent growth phenotype of the yeast sulfate transporter mutant strain _PROTEIN_ . constructs of in which the _PROTEIN_ domain was deleted resulted in synthesis of a truncated polypeptide that was unable to rescue the _PROTEIN_ phenotype . the inability of these constructs to rescue the mutant phenotype probably reflected both low level cellular accumulation of the transporter and the inability of the truncated protein to localize to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . fusing the _PROTEIN_ domain from other sulfate transporters to constructs restored elevated accumulation and _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ localization although the kinetics of sulfate uptake in the transformants were markedly altered with respect to transformants synthesizing wild type protein . these results suggest that the _PROTEIN_ domain is essential either directly or indirectly for facilitating localization of the transporters to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ but it also appears to influence the kinetic properties of the catalytic domain of transporters .
rescue of yeast mutant by a. thaliana sulfate transporter genes and requirement for the _PROTEIN_ s. cerevisiae mutant null for and sulfate transporter genes designated _PROTEIN_ is unable grow on medium containing sulfate as the sole sulfur source but grows rapidly in medium supplemented with methionine . a number of plant sulfate transporter genes have been shown to rescue this mutant to sulfate prototrophy suggesting that the sulfate transporters of plants can be synthesized in yeast cells and localized to their site of function . previous work demonstrated that the a. thaliana sulfate transporters and were able to complement the yeast _PROTEIN_ mutant and this heterologous system was used to determine the kinetic characteristics associated with this and other transporters . to evaluate the role of the _PROTEIN_ domain of a. thaliana sulfate transporters on transporter activity abundance and subcellular location in the heterologous yeast system we modified the gene in various ways and transformed it into _PROTEIN_ cells . most of our work focused on because it is a major transporter that functions in the roots of a. thaliana and several mutations that alter the activity of this protein have been previously identified . we also chose to use the _PROTEIN_ domains of a sulfate transporter in the same group as and a transporter in a different group to determine if the _PROTEIN_ domain of the different transporters influence transporter activity or localization within the cell . and are high affinity closely related transporters with an amino acid similarity of . in contrast the amino acid similarity between and is . furthermore and are co _PROTEIN_ in root cortex cells while is _PROTEIN_ specifically in leaves . although is _PROTEIN_ constitutively with some increase in the transcript level in response to sulfur deprivation _PROTEIN_ dramatically increases when plants are deprived of sulfate . the coding regions of the sulfate transporter genes derived from specific cdnas were separately cloned into the yeast _PROTEIN_ vector which was then used to transform _PROTEIN_ . is a high copy number plasmid vector with the origin of replication and the gene as a selection marker . within this vector the inserted gene was fused at the _PROTEIN_ terminal to the ha epitope tag . as shown qualitatively in fig . the ha tagged and but not rescued the mutant phenotype allowing it to grow on medium in which sulfate was the sole sulfur source . a quantitative evaluation of the growth of the rescued strain on sulfate containing liquid medium either with or without methionine supplementation is shown in fig . . table i shows the doubling time of the different strains and transformants . in medium supplemented with methionine transformants harboring the cdnas for the three different transporters grew at rates that ranged from of that of the parental strain _PROTEIN_ and attained a cell density of that of the parental strain . in contrast in medium devoid of methionine the _PROTEIN_ mutant was rescued by introduction of the or genes but not by introduction of the gene . those transformants harboring the or genes grew on medium with sulfate as the sole sulfur source at rates of of that of generally _PROTEIN_ harboring grew slightly faster than _PROTEIN_ harboring . to determine if the _PROTEIN_ domain of was essential for rescuing the _PROTEIN_ mutant phenotype we prepared constructs encoding truncated polypeptides devoid of the _PROTEIN_ domain . the limits of the _PROTEIN_ domain were defined by homology to the anti sigma _PROTEIN_ antagonist spoiiaa . the most _PROTEIN_ terminal tmd of is predicted to end at serine based on _METHOD_ and homology to spoiiaa starts at glutamine and ends at leucine as defined by prosite . two different constructs were tested for their ability to complement the _PROTEIN_ mutant in and the constructs encode truncated proteins that terminate at serine and tyrosine respectively . the protein lacks the entire _PROTEIN_ domain as well as the amino acids that comprise the region that links the tmds of the transporter to the _PROTEIN_ domain whereas the protein lacks the _PROTEIN_ domain but contains nearly all of the linking region . neither of these constructs was able to rescue the _PROTEIN_ mutant phenotype in medium containing sulfate as the sole sulfur source . however in methionine supplemented medium _PROTEIN_ transformed with these constructs grew essentially as well as _PROTEIN_ transformed with the entire gene or empty vector . these results raised the possibilities that the truncated protein products were nonfunctional could not localize to their site of action or were more unstable than the full length protein . to test if the _PROTEIN_ domain from one of the sulfate transporters could functionally substitute for that of another we constructed three chimeric genes in which _PROTEIN_ domains among the different sulfate transport polypeptides were exchanged . truncated was fused with the _PROTEIN_ domain from and to yield and . additionally the truncated polypeptide was fused to the _PROTEIN_ domain of to yield . all the chimeric proteins were ha tagged at their _PROTEIN_ termini . the yeast cells _PROTEIN_ grew as well as those _PROTEIN_ the full length polypeptide in medium lacking methionine while there was essentially no growth of cells _PROTEIN_ or . all of the strains with the chimeric constructs grew in methionine supplemented medium at rates comparable to that of _PROTEIN_ transformant with the entire gene or the empty vector . sulfate transport kinetics in yeast performed sulfate uptake assays with parental cells carrying the plasmid and with the _PROTEIN_ mutant harboring the and the chimeric constructs . the km and vmax for sulfate uptake of was and of pmol sulfate/s/mg dry weight respectively . cells harboring constructs encoding and showed high affinity sulfate transport with a km of and and a vmax of and pmol of sulfate/s/mg dw . _PROTEIN_ cells and _PROTEIN_ cells _PROTEIN_ or constructs failed to show detectable sulfate transport activity . mutant cells _PROTEIN_ the chimeric protein exhibited a fold lower affinity for sulfate and a vmax that was higher than that of cells harboring unmodified . cells harboring constructs for the chimeric proteins and showed little sulfate transport activity as indicated by their low vmax for sulfate uptake which was expected based on their inability to grow in sulfate containing medium that was not supplemented with methionine . localization of and chimeric transport examine the subcellular abundance and distribution of the introduced transporters we quantified the ha tagged proteins in total cellular extracts and in cellular _LOCATION_ of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ transformed with the various constructs after fractionation on sucrose gradients . an equal amount of total cellular protein from each strain was resolved by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ transferred to pvdf _LOCATION_ and as shown in fig . the ha tagged transporters were detected immunologically . the levels of the truncated _PROTEIN_ proteins in the cell were low relative to the levels observed in transformants _PROTEIN_ or the polypeptide was nearly undetectable . in contrast the levels of and transcripts in the transformants were nearly identical suggesting that the differences in protein levels were a consequence of post translational events . in strains _PROTEIN_ and multiple polypeptides of different molecular _METHOD_ were observed . the product with the greatest apparent molecular _METHOD_ and the most abundant product was kda which is the expected _METHOD_ of the full length polypeptide whereas a second antigenic polypeptide had an apparent molecular _METHOD_ of kda other less abundant lower molecular _METHOD_ antigenic species were also observed . substantial levels of apparent full length and polypeptides were also observed in whole cell preparations although transformants synthesizing these polypeptides were unable to grow in medium with sulfate as the sole sulfur source . these results suggest that the and polypeptides were either not properly localized to the cytoplasmic _LOCATION_ or that they were properly localized but unable to function in transporting sulfate into cells . fractionation of the _LOCATION_ of cells harboring and constructs presented in fig . shows that much of the full length protein in the transformants was present in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ co sedimenting at the bottom of the sucrose gradient with the marker for the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ . as shown in fig . between and of these transporters is present in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ fraction . these results suggest that all three of the full length sulfate transporter proteins localize to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and that even though appears correctly localized it is not effective at facilitating the transport of sulfate into yeast cells . furthermore either none or little of the protein is localized to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ with the majority being in the _LOCATION_ fraction it mostly co localized with the _LOCATION_ marker dolichol phosphate mannose synthase . in the case of much of the small amount of protein that accumulates in these cells co sediments with the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ marker . this suggests that the linker region is important for localizing the protein to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ or a _LOCATION_ fraction that co sediments with the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ in the gradient used for fractionation in these experiments in another fractionation experiment does not exactly co sediment with the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . furthermore the linking region either directly or indirectly affects the abundance of the protein in the cell . in contrast all of the chimeric polypeptides synthesized in s. cerevisiae transformants were synthesized at levels comparable to that of the unmodified transporters and all showed abundant prominent peaks in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ fraction with some co sedimentation with _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . these results suggest that placing a heterologous _PROTEIN_ domain at the _PROTEIN_ terminus of either or allows for increased accumulation and proper targeting of the polypeptide although the chimeric polypeptides with the exception of do not appear to function in sulfate transport or enable cells to grow on sulfate as the sole sulfur source . we also constructed an in frame fusion between and _METHOD_ with a alanine repeat linking to _METHOD_ . in cells harboring this construct we can visualize localization of the transporter in s. cerevisiae cells . as shown in fig . in cells _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ from the plasmid the _METHOD_ signal appeared to be present throughout the cytoplasm of the cell the exclusion of signal in the center of the cell is the consequence of the large _LOCATION_ present in the s. cerevisiae cell . in contrast in _PROTEIN_ cells harboring fused to _METHOD_ much of the _METHOD_ appeared localized to the cytoplasmic _LOCATION_ which is visualized as a more even distribution of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ over the entire cell surface . some of the _METHOD_ may be concentrated in the _LOCATION_ in the region around the _LOCATION_ typically representing _LOCATION_ and in the _LOCATION_ near the cell surface which may represent endosomes and cytoplasmic _LOCATION_ polypeptides that are being resorbed by the cell and degraded . transformants _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were able to grow in medium containing sulfate as the sole sulfur source at a rate similar to that of _PROTEIN_ transformed with .
