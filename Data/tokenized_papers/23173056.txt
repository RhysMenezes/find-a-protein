arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ is an endo _PROTEIN_ possessing a _PROTEIN_ binding domain . analysis of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ by promoter reporter gus rt pcr public transcriptome databases and _METHOD_ protein tagging demonstrated a high and selective _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in root hairs and in the endosperm . _PROTEIN_ in root hair cells started prior to bulge formation and continued during hair elongation . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ increased with treatments that increase density or length of root hairs . _PROTEIN_ in the endosperm extended sequentially to the micropylar peripheral and _PROTEIN_ compartments . a mutant with reduced _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ had a delay in germination and a marked reduction in root hair presence . complementation of the mutant partially improved both germination and root hair density . experiments with ectopically _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ with and without the demonstrated that both _METHOD_ of the protein are secreted and that targets the protein to specific regions of the cell wall but what makes these regions special is still unknown . the amino acid alignment of angiosperm genes with c terminal extensions illustrate that _PROTEIN_ belongs to a different clade than its tomato homolog . the latter has a that was shown to bind crystalline cellulose . we suggest that _PROTEIN_ is associated with the weakening of the cell wall during formation and growth of the root hair as well as with the sequential anterior posterior breakdown of the endosperm cell wall that provides space for the growing embryo . thus is likely that the of _PROTEIN_ recognizes a form of cellulose or _PROTEIN_ polymer that is prevalent in the wall of these specialized tissues and that is different than the one recognized by .
_PROTEIN_ is located on the upper arm of chromosome and encodes for a polypeptide amino acids long that is moderately glycosylated . this gene is composed of exons of which the first one carries a predicted signal peptide and the last one encodes the entire that is tethered to the catalytic core by a short polypeptide linker encoded in part by exon . the remaining exons encode the catalytic module . to gain a first insight into where _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ rt pcr was performed using a pcr primer pair based on the and last _PROTEIN_ exons and rna templates from major arabidopsis plant organs . results indicated that _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ abundantly in young siliques and in roots . a band of low intensity was also observed in young shoots but bands were undetected in flowers leaves and stem . comparison of rt pcr band intensity at pcr cycles also revealed that _PROTEIN_ was absent in flowers low in very young siliques peaks at and was absent at as siliques reach their maximal length . detection of _PROTEIN_ and actin messages by rt pcr using as template total rna isolated from flowers young siliques roots shoots expanded leaves and stem rt pcr comparing flower with three stages of silique development siliques reaching their maximal length . to examine _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ with spatio temporal resolution its putative promoter _PROTEIN_ was fused to the gus reporter gene _PROTEIN_ to generate _PROTEIN_ gus and used to transform a. thaliana columbia lansberg and shahadara ecotypes . independent transgenic lines from each ecotype showed gus activity in roots and young siliques . shahadara transgenic seeds were selected to monitor gus staining at daily intervals after cold stratification and transfer to continuous light . gus activity was negative at hours when some seeds had a ruptured testa and some had an emerging radicle . between hours when elongation of the radicle continues gus activity was strong in all the epidermal cells of the collet i.e. the root shoot junction . after days when cotyledons have emerged and the primary root is rapidly elongating the strong gus activity continued in the collet and extended to the differentiation zone of the _PROTEIN_ root . the blue staining was very strong only in the files of hair forming cells indicating low or no gus activity in the atrichoblasts . note that gus staining was detected in the hair cell before the bulging and emergence of the root hair and that the hair emerged closer to the bottom cross wall of the trichoblast as described by others . seedlings growing in media supplemented with sucrose have longer root hairs and strong gus staining in the hairs . gus activity was absent from the epidermal cells of the root cap and the meristematic region of the root tip . shahadara transgenic at hours post light incubation showing the seed coat ruptured . hours pli showing seeds when the radicle has already emerged and no signs of blue coloration . hours pli showing strong blue coloration of gus activity at emerging root hairs . hours pli showing the strong blue coloration at the collet zone with a close up to the right . day old seedling showing strong gus activity at the collet and at the differentiation zone of the _PROTEIN_ root . close up of a _PROTEIN_ root tip showing gus activity in trichoblast before the bulging and emergence of the root hair . emerging root hair proximal to the bottom cross wall of the trichoblast showing strong blue coloration . columbia transgenic seedlings growing in media supplemented with sucrose with abundant and longer root hairs . immature seed of a green silique positioned cm down from the top flower bud showing _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in the micropylar endosperm and toward the peripheral endosperm . immature seed showing blue coloration in the embryo proper and the surrounding endosperm partially obscured by the encasing of the seed coat . tissues were viewed in a light microscope at . the bar lines in each photograph represent . gus activity was also detected within the seeds of young siliques in the compartments of the seed endosperm particularly at the micropylar endosperm and the peripheral endosperm while older siliques displayed no stain . note that even the embryo proper shows a weak blue coloration revealed through the seed coat . to substantiate our data we searched genevestigator https //www.genevestigator.com for _PROTEIN_ gene _PROTEIN_ in publically available transcriptomes . we confirmed that the _PROTEIN_ message was detected most abundantly at the root zone where the root hairs develop . we also confirmed the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in developing seeds noticing that _PROTEIN_ message is present in the three domains of the seed endosperm i.e . the mce the pen and the _PROTEIN_ . next we expanded the genevestigator search to compare _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ with cell wall genes known to regulate root hair morphogenesis . a heat map was developed with this public data to illustrate that the abundance of _PROTEIN_ message in the root hair zone of the _PROTEIN_ and the _PROTEIN_ root is comparable to that of root hair marker genes including endo xyloglucan transglycosylases _PROTEIN_ expansins _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ structural cell wall proteins _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ a pectin esterase . similarly and comparable to those root hair marker genes _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is lower in the stem in adult leaves and in other root cell types including the endodermis the cortex atrichoblast and the stele . heat map showing level of _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ and of five known root hair specific genes including _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ for selected anatomical regions of arabidopsis heat map illustrating _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in the micropylar peripheral _PROTEIN_ and the embryo proper at five seed developmental stages starting at the preglobular stage and ending at the mature green stage . we also searched the publically available transcriptomes of arabidopsis endosperm before and after cellularization _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . a heat map illustrates the progression of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ level in the three domains of the endosperm and in the embryo proper through stages of seed development . _PROTEIN_ message is present in the mce at low level at the globular developmental stage and persists in the mce at the heart developmental stage . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ then extends into the pen at the linear cotyledon stage reaching here the highest level of message accumulation and finally expands into the cze at the green cotyledon stage . thus _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ to follow the sequential _PROTEIN_ antero posterior organization of endosperm cellularization and endosperm dissolution . there is also _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in the embryo proper at the heart and linear cotyledon stages . interestingly and consistent with our analysis of gus transgenic seeds during imbibition and germination the transcriptomes data of seed germination indicated that _PROTEIN_ message level is very low and unchanged all through seed imbibition rupture of the endosperm breakage of the testa and radicle emergence . if _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is localized at the root hairs gus activity in the whole root of the transgenic lines should quantitatively correlate with root length since longer roots will have more root hairs . thus seedlings of the transgenic line were exposed to treatments that generate either shorter roots or longer roots over an equal growth period . the correlation between root length and gus activity was confirmed in the mannitol treatment where both measurements were negatively impacted by the increasing osmotic stress imposed by mannitol . moreover each of the measurements was reduced in about equal proportion e.g . a linear regression between the two variables extrapolated to around zero . however when transgenic seeds were germinated and _PROTEIN_ in control media supplemented with or sucrose gus activity increased to a much greater degree than root length . in addition seedlings grown in sucrose concentration had longer root hairs compared with seedlings in control or mannitol media . thus assuming that those treatments do not affect the number of root hair forming cells the data suggests that _PROTEIN_ contributes not only to the formation of the root hair but also to the lengthening of the hair . transgenic seeds were stratified and grown on half strength _METHOD_ medium supplemented respectively with none mannitol sucrose and _PROTEIN_ in continuous light at . after days root length was measured using pictures of the plates and root gus activity was determined on a known number of roots collected from the plates using mug as substrate . _LOCATION_ bars show the standard _LOCATION_ of mu production rate and the standard _LOCATION_ of mean root length . close up of wild type roots showing the effect of growing in control media or in media supplemented with sucrose or mannitol . another treatment known to affect root growth and root hair density is the plant hormone ethylene . thus seeds of transgenic _PROTEIN_ gus were germinated in agar plates supplemented with aminocyclopropane _PROTEIN_ a substrate for ethylene synthesis in both light and dark conditions . at h post germination in continuous light seedling roots displayed an increase in root hair abundance as expected and a strong blue coloration throughout the root . at h post germination in darkness the transgenic seedling showed the triple response and a strong blue coloration in the root . this contrasted with the very weak blue coloration observed in the root of the etiolated ethylene insensitive mutant _LOCATION_ also carrying the same _PROTEIN_ gus construct and germinated in darkness under the same conditions . transgenic _PROTEIN_ gus seedling growing in a media supplemented with mm acc and continuous light . etiolated days old transgenic ethylene mutant _LOCATION_ carrying _PROTEIN_ gus and transgenic wild type _PROTEIN_ gus grown in media supplemented with acc and in the dark . to further analyze the regulation of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ by ethylene transgenic _PROTEIN_ gus seeds were germinated in agar media supplemented with acc and kept in darkness for days . after the treatment the whole seedling was used for gus activity determination . results showed a fold increase in gus activity in etiolated seedlings grown in the presence of acc compared to those grown in control media . the effect of avg an inhibitor of ethylene synthesis and the effect of both avg and acc to test for inhibition reversal was also analyzed in day old transgenic seedlings kept in continuous light . the activity from seedlings in avg was around half the activity in acc . the activity of seedlings exposed to both chemicals was less than the activity in presence of acc alone . this indicated that simply adding acc could not fully reverse the inhibition caused by avg as noted by others _PROTEIN_ . finally the effect of acc was dose dependent as shown by the analysis of gus activity in day old seedlings exposed to or acc and kept in continuous light . both shoot and root were analyzed separately and both showed a concomitant increase in gus activity compared to seedlings grown on control plates and the activity was always greater in the root than in the shoot tissue . overall these results indicate that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is regulated by ethylene which increases root hair density . activity in the whole seedling calculated by adding activity in the root and shoot . fluorometric determination of gus activity using mug as enzyme substrate and extracts from transgenic _PROTEIN_ gus . the activity values represent the slope of the regression of mu produced versus time of incubation for each treatment using the indicated tissue extract . treatments included light and dark germination and media supplemented with increasing concentrations of acc _PROTEIN_ or with avg or with both acc and avg . the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ and of the same set of root hair marker genes mentioned above was searched in public root transcriptomes that used treatments or genetic backgrounds that promote or reduce root hair development . a heat map shows that different treatments that promote root hair growth over control treatment such as iron phosphorous and water deficiency changed the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ of the marker genes in similar ways . particularly all increased around two fold with phosphorous and water deficiency . in contrast in mutant lines that develop shorter root hairs like _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ of these genes _PROTEIN_ compared to wild type controls . moreover in a line that over _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and resulted in longer root hairs _PROTEIN_ and the marker genes increased gene _PROTEIN_ . the deduced amino acid sequence of _PROTEIN_ predicted the presence of a signal peptide at the n terminus suggesting that the nascent polypeptide is imported into the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and then secreted outside the cell . to elucidate experimentally the cellular localization of this protein and the role of the cbm in localization we generated fusions between the _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ . the fusion protein was _PROTEIN_ using the promoter to guarantee a strong _PROTEIN_ . both c terminal _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and n terminal _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusions were generated to test for possible interference from the _METHOD_ . each construct was infiltrated into n. benthamiana leaves to induce transient _PROTEIN_ and then the localization of the _METHOD_ protein was analyzed before and after plasmolysis by confocal laser microscopy . _METHOD_ _METHOD_ emitted by the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion construct with the cbm without the cbm without the _PROTEIN_ i.e . a construct _PROTEIN_ the _METHOD_ alone as positive control . images were viewed under a water lens . scale bars are . green _METHOD_ before plasmolysis after plasmolysis and overlay with brightfield transmitted light image to show the integrity of the cell wall after the treatment . inset white boxes in a and b highlight the difference in the _METHOD_ signal when the cbm is removed . yellow arrows point to the _METHOD_ in the cell wall while the white arrows point to the position of _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ after plasmolysis . there was a clear difference in the distribution of _METHOD_ from _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion with the cbm vs. without the cbm . with the cbm the _METHOD_ contours only some segments of the cell wall surface the discrete _METHOD_ segments were positioned in some neck and lobe regions of the epidermal cells and the intensity of the green _METHOD_ was high . in contrast without the cbm the _METHOD_ was diffused and dispersed throughout the epidermal cell wall . when n. benthamiana leaves were infiltrated as above and subsequently incubated in sucrose the localization of _METHOD_ from _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ with the cbm showed no signs of alteration despite the retraction of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . in contrast the localization of _METHOD_ from _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ lacking the cbm became diffused accumulating in _LOCATION_ regions as blotches of random sizes . no _METHOD_ was observed in the _LOCATION_ in either case . this contrasted with the distribution of _METHOD_ from the _METHOD_ alone which appears inside and outlining each cell very strongly . thus secretion _PROTEIN_ to the cell wall was confirmed for both _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ with and without the cbm and the localization was altered when lacking the cbm . although the _METHOD_ was weaker the same pattern of localization was observed for the n terminal fusion with and without the cbm where the _METHOD_ was inserted between the signal peptide and the rest of _PROTEIN_ . this infers that _METHOD_ does not interfere with the secretion of _PROTEIN_ in either the c or n terminal fusions . because of its more intense _METHOD_ we used the c terminal _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusions for further studies . to analyze the possible consequences of over _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ with and without the cbm we transformed wild type arabidopsis with the c terminal _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion constructs . although _METHOD_ was observed in the transformed lines there were no obvious phenotypic difference among the over _PROTEIN_ lines and wild type . the studies included analysis of germination efficiency and growth of root and hypocotyl at day post germination . nevertheless the images of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ of these lines illustrated again a different spatial distribution between _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ with and without the cbm . most noticeable was the accumulation of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ in association with the stomata cavity only if the cbm is present . to gain further insight into _PROTEIN_ gene function we obtained from the salk collection three lines with a t dna insertion in _PROTEIN_ gene . the salk and salk lines were indicated to have a t dna insertion at intron number two while the line salk in exon number eight . using gene specific primers and a t dna left border primer a homozygous mutant for each line was identified and the position of insertion confirmed by sequencing the dna segment amplified from the t dna left border primer . our sequence determined that the t dna insertion is intronic in salk and salk but indicated that in the salk line the insertion was also intronic and toward the end of intron . diagram of _PROTEIN_ gene with blue boxes representing exons separated by introns depicted by solid lines and position of the t dna in three mutant lines . black arrowheads represent the position of primers used to detect _PROTEIN_ message . detection of _PROTEIN_ message by rt pcr using as template total rna isolated form green siliques comparing wild type salk salk and wild type genomic dna . rt pcr of actin was used as an internal standard . note that in both panels genomic dna yields a larger mw band because the primers used are separated by one intron . similar age wild type and homozygous salk and salk growing in soil . _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in salk and was further analyzed by rt pcr using total rna from green siliques and a primer pair based on exon seven and on the . these primers amplify a bp segment from the _PROTEIN_ cdna transcript and a bp segment from genomic dna . the results indicated that the bp transcript band was clearly detected in wild type barely visible in salk and detected in salk though less intense than in wild type . thus these lines are not true null mutants and both have a variable reduction on _PROTEIN_ gene _PROTEIN_ compared to wild type perhaps because the t dna insertion is removed when the introns are spliced out with different frequency depending on the insertion position . in general growing in soil both mutant lines germinated produced normal plants and abundant seeds yet salk plants consistently displayed a reduction in rosette size compared to wild type and salk line . therefore growth of salk was further characterized on _METHOD_ agar plates always comparing with wild type . seeds of salk showed a delay in germination of and the delay became even more evident when the agar media was supplemented with hyperosmotic mannitol . salk and wild type showed no apparent differences in root hair abundance or root hair length at the collet or at the _PROTEIN_ root h post germination . however once the root began to grow down the agar plate the _PROTEIN_ root of the mutant showed a noticeably lower root hair abundance compared to wild type . the average root hair abundance for wild type few millimeters above the zone of differentiation was hairs/mm while for the mutants was hairs/mm . this suggests that the root hair phenotype becomes visible when a low activity threshold for _PROTEIN_ is reached . percent germination versus time of salk and wild type columbia using control media or media supplemented with hyperosmotic mannitol . close up of a day old wild type root growing vertically on control medium . close up of a day old salk root growing vertically on control medium with only one root hair visible . other studies comparing wild type with salk included a comparison of root length growth in control media over a day period post light incubation . the time course demonstrated consistently that the wild type roots were longer than those of the mutant and that the absolute differences between them remain about the same over the day period of growth . therefore the difference in root length observed was a reflection of the delay in germination and not due to a reduced rate of root growth . a comparison in a media supplemented with sucrose to stimulate root hair growth demonstrated clearly the root hair abundance difference between the two lines . note that the mature plants have small stature compared to wild type and that some siliques from the _PROTEIN_ stem were shorter and defective . results of equivalent experiments performed with salk had similar tendencies but differences were smaller . finally a feature common to both mutant lines was that only of the seeds germinated compared to of wild type seeds after four years of storage in a dry cabinet . these results suggested that both mutants seeds lost viability faster than those of the wild type and that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in the endosperm may contribute to seed longevity during storage . subsequently we complemented the mutants with the wild type gene to examine whether the reduction of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in the mutants contributed to the delay in seed germination and to the reduction in root hair abundance and length . complementation was accomplished by transformation of the homozygous salk and salk lines with a construct carrying the full length _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ driven by the double promoter . the selected complemented lines used for phenotypic characterization were hygromycin resistant _METHOD_ positive and either homozygous or heterozygous dominant because gene _PROTEIN_ under the promoter confers a dominant character . three phenotypic characters germination and root hair abundance and length were analyzed . in each study the comparison included the wild type the mutant and the complemented mutant . two independent trials were conducted to measure percent germination of seeds at h post light incubation . in both trials the germination of salk improved significantly with complementation _PROTEIN_ but only in trial two did reach the germination level of the wild type . for salk the germination was not different compared to the wild type and although the germination of compl salk was slightly higher than the wild type the difference was not statistically significant . we concluded that the complemented lines were only partially rescued by the fusion construct with the _METHOD_ and that the fusion enzyme may have reduced enzyme activity . nevertheless they also supported the hypothesis that _PROTEIN_ plays a role preparing the seed for germination during the period of high _PROTEIN_ in the endosperm . percent seed germination of wild type salk lines and salk lines _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ driven by the promoter . seeds were distributed in control _METHOD_ agar plates and cold stratified . the percentage of seeds showing radical protrusion were counted after of transferring the plates to a light incubator . letter superscripts denote groups that are significantly different from each other based on the tukey _PROTEIN_ test for multiple comparison of proportions p except for group c in trial the difference between salk and compl salk has p . analysis of root hair abundance and length were conducted in day old seedlings growing on control agar plates . while we could find patches with hairs on the roots compl salk it was not easy to verify the increase by visual observation alone . therefore we systematically counted the root hairs on pictures of consecutive mm of root segments to quantify an average density . density was quite variable between roots and within a root with a range of hairs for wt and hairs for compl salk . nevertheless the complemented mutant had a significantly greater average root hair density than the mutant . as mentioned above complementation did not totally rescue the wt phenotype in _METHOD_ of root hair abundance and length . the average root hair length for wild type was mm while for the compl salk was mm . on the box for each arabidopsis line the red center line is the median root hair density the top and bottom edges of the blue box are the and percentiles of the distribution and the black whiskers extend to the most extreme data points . insets close up of a root segment above the zone of root hair differentiation to illustrate the root hair density and length of wild type salk and compl salk . pictures were taken at magnification . lines represent . all sequenced genomes of higher plants and early photosynthetic species such as physcomitrella selaginella and the unicellular algae chlamydomonas contain genes coding for endo _PROTEIN_ possessing a c terminal extension . the specific protein sequence accessions numbers and locus identification for each gene are presented in . the phylogenetic tree using chlamydomonas as a root shows that the proteins from lower photosynthetic species form a separate clade that is distinct from the two other clades formed by genes from higher plants . each clade from higher plants includes members of the monocot and dicot plants . a rooted consensus tree was constructed from the deduced amino acid sequences of _METHOD_ and lower plant endo _PROTEIN_ with a c terminal extension . protein sequences were aligned using clustal which was subsequently input into phylip to perform maximum likelihood phylogeny reconstruction . arrows mark _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ and in _PROTEIN_ . the different proteins in the tree are identified by species followed by a letter suffix to distinguish multiple members from the same species . for arabidopsis the suffix distinguishes the three members of class c. the branches of the tree are color coded to denote the monocot and dicot members of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . the specific protein sequence accessions numbers and locus identification for each gene are presented in . the tomato with a at the c terminal extension that was shown to bind crystalline cellulose is placed in clade . the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ and its paralogue in a. lyrata also possessing a at the c terminal extension are both placed in clade . instead _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and corresponding paralogues of a. lyrata are all placed in clade of which several are _PROTEIN_ in fruit . it s apparent then that enzymes with c terminal extensions from clade are distinct from those in clade and this distinction may represent differences in protein structure and possibly functional differences . the difference in amino acid composition between members of clade and clade is illustrated in the amino acid alignment of dicot with c terminal extensions . the c terminal extension of members of are enriched in glutamine while members of clade are enriched in serine . to determine if other enzymes from clade have same functions as _PROTEIN_ we searched for their _PROTEIN_ profile in public microarray databases . the medicago truncatula gene _PROTEIN_ atlas indicates that of clade is exclusively _PROTEIN_ in root hair cells . also the _PROTEIN_ of the two soybean members of had been analyzed along segments of the _PROTEIN_ root by quantitative rt pcr using primers that amplify both genes . the highest _PROTEIN_ of these genes occurs in the root segment mm behind the root meristem where cell elongation occurs and root hair initiation begins . at each side of this segment the _PROTEIN_ is lower and is undetected in leaves . unfortunately probes for these two soybean genes are not included in the genechip microarray of microdissected soybean seeds . efforts to have global transcriptome profiling of every tissue in poplar and sorghum are in progress . from the data already available we found that the corresponding members of clade from these two plants are both preferentially _PROTEIN_ in the root over shoots with some _PROTEIN_ in young leaves and nodes in poplar .

shaking . the abaxial side of inch leaves was infiltrated using a ml syringe supporting the adaxial side of the leaf with the paper card . the infiltration medium bled into the leaf forming a inch diameter blotch . the plant was placed under natural sunlight for hours with watering and infiltrated areas were observed with a zeiss lsm confocal microscope . for stable a. thaliana transformation strains carrying the _METHOD_ fusion clones were grown in culture and used as recommended for floral dip transformation . seeds were screened on _METHOD_ media agar plates with hygromycin . at least independent transformant lines were collected for each and generation seeds were used for further studies . transformation was confirmed in seedlings by surveying _METHOD_ florescence using an epi _METHOD_ micrscope . seedlings were grown in control half strength _METHOD_ media using large petri dishes kept vertically for up to days . the dish base was divided into two half so that the two arabidopsis lines to be compared were growing in the same dish . photographs of the plates that included a ruler were taken to determine mean root length using imagej software . root hair density was determined on the _PROTEIN_ root using photographs of the _PROTEIN_ roots at magnification . efforts were made to _PROTEIN_ the roots growing over the surface of the agar to keep as much as possible the roots separated from each other and _PROTEIN_ constant humidity while taking the pictures to avoid collapsing the root hairs . the root hairs longer than mm were counted in mm consecutive intervals starting at mm from the tip to exclude the zone of elongation and the zone of root hair formation containing root hairs at different developmental stages . the root length surveyed was mm for wild type and up to mm for the mutant and the complemented line . the analysis included around roots per line . differences in mean root hair density between the mutant and the complemented line were tested for significance using _PROTEIN_ . although the root hair length and density changes along older segments of root where fewer root hairs are visible the newer segments if the root is growing outside the agar media have turgid and abundant root hairs that can be easily detected with a microscope . lsm image browser software was used under expert mode . the argon laser was used at power . the plan neofluar objective lens was used to visualize the image at magnification under transmitted light . after the sample was focused the transmitted light was turned off and the blue excitation light with a _METHOD_ filter was turned on . once the desired image was observed image scanning was performed with the argon laser . the fitc dual with rhodamine single track configuration _PROTEIN_ was used to scan the _METHOD_ signal _PROTEIN_ as well as the red chlorophyll _METHOD_ . the transmitted light image was scanned simultaneously through a different channel . a single scan with line averaging of was used to obtain the final image . a c apochromat w corr water objective lens was used to image samples at magnification . the amino acid sequence of _PROTEIN_ used as queries to blast search fully sequenced plant genomes plus genes from partially sequenced plants described in the _PROTEIN_ activating enzyme database . a percent identity multiple sequence alignment was generated using clustalw at http . seqboot was used for a data set bootstrap resampling of the clustalw data . the consense file was used to draw a rectangular phylogram in dendroscope . protpars was used to obtain the most likely unrooted phylogenies using the parsimony method . consense was used to obtain a rooted consensus tree from the protpars multiple phylogeny output and input into phylip to construct a rooted consensus tree . chlamydomonas was used as a root because it is considered the most distant photosynthetic organism to land plants .
