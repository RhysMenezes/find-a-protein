plant cortical microtubule arrays determine the cell wall deposition pattern and proper cell shape and function . although various microtubule associated proteins regulate the cortical microtubule array the _METHOD_ underlying marked rearrangement of cortical microtubules during xylem differentiation are not fully understood . here we show that local rho of plant _PROTEIN_ signaling targets an arabidopsis thaliana kinesin protein kinesin to cortical microtubules to establish distinct patterns of secondary cell wall formation in xylem cells . kinesin was preferentially localized with cortical microtubules in secondary cell wall pits areas where cortical microtubules are depolymerized to prevent cell wall deposition . this localization of kinesin required the presence of the activated rop _PROTEIN_ microtubule _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ protein and cortical microtubules . knockdown of kinesin resulted in the formation of smaller secondary wall pits while overexpression of kinesin enlarged their surface area . kinesin alone could depolymerize microtubules in vitro however both _PROTEIN_ and kinesin were required for the depolymerization of cortical microtubules in vivo . these results indicate that kinesin regulates the formation of secondary wall pits by promoting cortical microtubule depolymerization via the rop _PROTEIN_ pathway .
to examine the subcellular localization of kinesin in differentiating xylem cells pkinesin _METHOD_ kinesin was introduced into cultured arabidopsis cells harboring inducible vascular related no apical meristem/arabidopsis transcription activation _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ which promotes metaxylem vessel cell differentiation . punctuated green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ signals were detected preferentially in the secondary cell wall pits of differentiating metaxylem vessel cells . a projection of time lapse images with intensity profiling confirmed the accumulation of kinesin in secondary cell wall pits . double labeling experiments and projection of time lapse images revealed that kinesin colocalized with cortical microtubules in these regions . a kymograph analysis in which the behavior of kinesin along the microtubule over time is sequentially displayed side by side revealed that kinesin was associated with microtubules in secondary wall pits . the localization and dynamics of kinesin identified here are similar to those of _PROTEIN_ therefore the interaction between these proteins was examined . cointroduction of kinesin and _PROTEIN_ into arabidopsis cells caused depolymerization of microtubules therefore we used a truncated kinsein that lacked the n terminal region containing the motor domain but included the c terminal _PROTEIN_ interacting coiled coil domain . as expected _PROTEIN_ and kinesin colocalized in the _LOCATION_ domains underlying secondary cell wall pits . to determine whether kinesin interacts with _PROTEIN_ directly in these regions a bimolecular _METHOD_ complementation assay was used . _PROTEIN_ and kinesein were fused with the c terminal _METHOD_ and n terminal _METHOD_ regions of yellow _METHOD_ protein respectively and then _PROTEIN_ in the leaf epidermis of nicotiana benthamiana . no _METHOD_ signals were detected following _PROTEIN_ of either construct alone but a strong signal was generated following coexpression of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ kinesein indicating that kinesin interacts with _PROTEIN_ in vivo . when these constructs were introduced into inducible arabidopsis xylem cells the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ signal did not overlap with that of wheat germ agglutinin labeled secondary cell walls indicating that kinesin interacts directly with _PROTEIN_ in secondary cell wall pits . we next examined the _PROTEIN_ dependency of kinesin localization . _METHOD_ kinesin was localized to the cytoplasm in of _PROTEIN_ knockdown _PROTEIN_ cells while it localized to filamentous structures which are microtubules in of control cells . the remaining six cells showed the localization along microtubules as observed in control cells . this suggests that the localization of kinesin along microtubules in secondary cell wall pits is dependent upon _PROTEIN_ . on the other hand in cells coexpressing tagred _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ a constitutively active form of _PROTEIN_ that induces broad activation of _PROTEIN_ which causes the microtubule localization of _PROTEIN_ broadly kinesein was broadly localized to microtubules in of observed cells . these results suggest that kinesin is associated with the active rop _PROTEIN_ complex . to examine the role of kinesin in secondary cell wall formation kinesin was knocked down by rna interference . we introduced kinesin rna interference /lexa _METHOD_ into _PROTEIN_ inducible cultured cells this construct contains an inverted repeat of the kinesin fragment and an additional _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ cassette that enables identification of transformed cells without cell selection using antibiotics . we used _PROTEIN_ rnai/lexa _METHOD_ as a control . _METHOD_ positive cells were collected by _METHOD_ activated cell sorting and kinesin mrna levels were measured by quantitative rt pcr . kinesin mrna levels were similar in _METHOD_ positive and _METHOD_ negative cells from the gus rnai/lexa _METHOD_ introduced culture however in the kinesin rnai/lexa _METHOD_ introduced culture the kinesin mrna levels in _METHOD_ positive cells were significantly lower than those in _METHOD_ negative cells . in accordance with the reduced levels of kinesin mrna kinesin knockdown cells showed smaller secondary cell wall pits than control cells . similarly an arabidopsis line in which t dna was inserted into an exon of the kinesin gene had undetectable levels of kinsein and smaller pits in the secondary cell walls of root metaxylem vessels than wild type plants . introduction of pkinesin _METHOD_ kinesin complemented the phenotype of reduced pit size confirming the role of kinesin in secondary cell wall pit expansion . however _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was not detected clearly in the complemented plants probably as a result of low _PROTEIN_ level of kinesin . we also examined the effect of kinesin overexpression on secondary cell wall pit size . when kinesin _PROTEIN_ was induced by treating arabidopsis plants harboring lexa _METHOD_ kinesin with estradiol for d the root metaxylem vessels produced abnormally large secondary cell wall pits and protoxylem vessels exhibited slightly wider secondary cell wall bundles than wild type protoxylem vessels . to examine cortical microtubule organization in cells overexpressing kinesin in vivo lexa _METHOD_ kinesin was introduced into plants harboring _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . the parallel cortical microtubules in root epidermal cells were completely disrupted h after the induction of _METHOD_ kinesin . consistent with this long term _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ kinesin caused the roots to swell as a result of microtubule disruption . these results suggest that kinesin enlarges secondary cell wall pits through microtubule disassembly . to determine whether kinesin shows microtubule depolymerizing activity an in vitro microtubule depolymerization assay was performed . glutathione s transferase _PROTEIN_ tagged kinesein and _PROTEIN_ were overexpressed in escherichia coli and then purified . as a positive control _PROTEIN_ a human kinesin protein that can induce microtubule disassembly was also prepared . the purified _PROTEIN_ tagged proteins were incubated with taxol stabilized microtubules containing fluorescein tagged tubulin in a buffer supplemented with _PROTEIN_ or adenylyl imidodiphosphate a nonhydrolyzable analog of _PROTEIN_ . microtubule depolymerization was then observed under a _METHOD_ microscope . in the presence of _PROTEIN_ both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ kinesin disrupted microtubules while _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ did not however in the presence of amppnp _PROTEIN_ kinesin could not induce depolymerization . microtubule depolymerization was then examined further using biochemical methods . the samples were ultracentrifuged and then separated by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in this experiment the supernatant and pellet fractions represented tubulin dimers and microtubule polymers respectively . in the presence of _PROTEIN_ the addition of _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ kinesin markedly increased the amount of tubulin in the supernatant and _PROTEIN_ the amount of tubulin in the microtubule pellet . these effects were not seen when _PROTEIN_ was replaced with amppnp indicating that _PROTEIN_ kinesin possesses _PROTEIN_ dependent microtubule depolymerization activity . although our experiments revealed that kinsein promotes microtubule depolymerization both in vitro and in vivo previous articles reported that kinesin does not localize to cortical microtubules . we hypothesized that this apparent discrepancy is attributable to the absence or presence of _PROTEIN_ which may contribute to the targeting of kinesin to microtubules in vivo . to investigate this hypothesis the localization of kinesin and cortical microtubule density were examined by introducing lexa _METHOD_ kinesin and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ into an arabidopsis nonxylem cell line which does not _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . kinesin was not localized to cortical microtubules and did not induce cortical microtubule depolymerization in nonxylem cells . instead kinesin was localized to punctate structures which is consistent with previous reports . by contrast kinesin was localized to the cytoplasm . next to enable coexpression of _PROTEIN_ and kinesin lexa _METHOD_ kinesin was introduced into a newly established stable transgenic cell line harboring lexa _PROTEIN_ . coexpression of _METHOD_ kinesin and _PROTEIN_ led to a marked reduction in the number of cortical microtubules indicating that kinesin requires _PROTEIN_ to depolymerize microtubules in vivo . induction of _PROTEIN_ shifted the localization of kinesin from the cytoplasm to the cortical microtubules . although coexpression of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ kinesin caused loss of cortical microtubules these proteins were completely colocalized in structures reminiscent of aggregated microtubules . coexpression of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ kinesin did not affect cortical microtubules but these two proteins were also colocalized along cortical microtubules . these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ targets kinesin to cortical microtubules and is therefore required for its microtubule depolymerization activity .
