transcriptomic adjustment plays an important role in arabidopsis thaliana seed germination and deetiolation in response to environmental light signals . the g box cis element is commonly present in promoters of genes that respond positively or negatively to the light signal . in pursuing additional transcriptional regulators that modulate light mediated transcriptome changes we identified _PROTEIN_ a basic region/leu zipper motif transcription _PROTEIN_ by g box dna affinity chromatography . we confirmed that _PROTEIN_ has g box specific binding activity . analysis of _PROTEIN_ mutants revealed that _PROTEIN_ is a negative regulator in light mediated inhibition of cell elongation but a positive regulator in light regulated seed germination . transcriptome analysis supported that _PROTEIN_ is primarily a transcriptional repressor regulating light gibberellic acid and abscisic acid responsive genes . chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis revealed that _PROTEIN_ could directly target aba responsive genes and _PROTEIN_ a della gene in the ga signaling pathway . _PROTEIN_ could also indirectly repress the _PROTEIN_ of phytochrome interacting _PROTEIN_ which encodes a basic helix loop helix protein coordinating hormone responses during seed germination . by repressing the _PROTEIN_ of these genes _PROTEIN_ functions to promote seed germination and hypocotyl elongation during the early stages of arabidopsis seedling development .
the ability of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ to bind the g box sequence in vitro inspired us to use dna affinity chromatography to isolate g box binding proteins from arabidopsis _LOCATION_ extracts . figure shows a simplified experimental procedure to streamline the dna affinity chromatography liquid chromatography and tandem _METHOD_ _METHOD_ we used to identify g box binding proteins in arabidopsis . among the proteins identified g box binding _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is a previously reported g box binding protein regulating blue light mediated photomorphogenesis in arabidopsis . therefore the methodology we adopted could successfully isolate proteins with affinity to the g box sequence . _PROTEIN_ was also identified as g box binding protein . electrophoretic mobility shift assays _METHOD_ revealed that purified _PROTEIN_ recombinant protein could bind tandem repeats of the g box probe and form several mobility retarded protein dna complexes . this result _METHOD_ previous reports that the _PROTEIN_ g box complex could be formed by incubating the g box probe with a crude protein mixture containing in vitro translated _PROTEIN_ protein or recombinant _PROTEIN_ proteins . the formation of _PROTEIN_ g box complexes was reduced in the presence of excess unlabeled g box competitors which suggests that _PROTEIN_ specifically binds to the g box cis element . like _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is a member of group g basic domain/leucine zipper motif _PROTEIN_ transcription _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis . group g _PROTEIN_ have a c terminal _PROTEIN_ dna binding domain and an n terminal pro rich region with transactivation activity . the _PROTEIN_ pattern of _PROTEIN_ was queried in the genevestigator _PROTEIN_ database . except for a much higher _PROTEIN_ in seeds _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ constitutively and at a low level in various developmental stages . the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ was not significantly altered under various biotic or abiotic stresses including light and plant hormones . among _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ acts as a positive regulator in arabidopsis photomorphogenesis by affecting the _PROTEIN_ of downstream genes in response to a light signal . however _PROTEIN_ is a negative regulator in blue light mediated inhibition of hypocotyl elongation in arabidopsis . the binding of _PROTEIN_ to the light responsive element g box prompted us to examine whether mutation in _PROTEIN_ results in aberrant light regulated development in arabidopsis . we analyzed two _PROTEIN_ mutant alleles . in a columbia background _PROTEIN_ carries a t dna insertion upstream of the transcriptional start site and represents a weak allele with residual _PROTEIN_ transcripts . however the t dna insertion in intron of _PROTEIN_ gives rise to a null allele _PROTEIN_ in a landsberg _LOCATION_ background with no detectable transcripts . polyclonal antiserum against recombinant _PROTEIN_ protein was generated for detecting _PROTEIN_ protein in various genetic backgrounds . immunoblot analysis confirmed that _PROTEIN_ protein could accumulate at a low level in plants harboring the weak allele _PROTEIN_ but was not detected in mutants with the null allele _PROTEIN_ . the absence of the _PROTEIN_ signal in _PROTEIN_ on the immunoblot also indicated that the antiserum was _PROTEIN_ specific . during the deetiolation process light inhibits hypocotyl elongation in a dose dependent manner . we examined whether _PROTEIN_ contributes to this process by monitoring the hypocotyl length of _PROTEIN_ mutants under different qualities of light . because different germination rates might complicate the data interpretation the germination of all genotypes was synchronized by d cold treatment . under various fluences of rl _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants had shorter hypocotyls than did corresponding wild type seedlings under long day _PROTEIN_ conditions . the light hypersensitivity of _PROTEIN_ mutants could also be detected under white light but not under fr or blue light . the severity of the light hypersensitive phenotype was associated with the residual or lack of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ . the light hypersensitive phenotype of _PROTEIN_ was less evident under continuous light . this situation may explain the lack of photomorphogenic phenotype in _PROTEIN_ reported previously . the analyses of _PROTEIN_ phenotypes under different light regimes and the inclusion of the _PROTEIN_ null allele in this study solidify the role of _PROTEIN_ in photomorphogenesis . the light hypersensitive phenotypes in both _PROTEIN_ mutants could be rescued by _PROTEIN_ a genomic fragment of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . by contrast transgenic plants overexpressing _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ showed an elongated hypocotyl under all fluences of rl tested . the overexpression of _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ seedlings was confirmed by immunoblot analysis . these results are consistent among independent complementation and overexpression lines . thus _PROTEIN_ functions as a negative regulator in rl induced inhibition of hypocotyl elongation during photomorphogenesis . interestingly the complementation lines in a ler background _PROTEIN_ accumulated high levels of _PROTEIN_ protein but did not exhibit the elongated hypocotyl phenotype . the two arabidopsis ecotypes may have different sensitivities to the level of _PROTEIN_ protein . alternatively the use of or _PROTEIN_ promoter may lead to the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in different tissues thus showing differential impact on hypocotyl elongation in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ seedlings . two putative _LOCATION_ localization sequences amino acids to and to reside in the _PROTEIN_ domain of _PROTEIN_ . therefore _PROTEIN_ might be a _LOCATION_ localized transcriptional regulator . the _LOCATION_ localization of _PROTEIN_ was previously observed by transient overexpression of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein fusion proteins in either onion epidermal cells or arabidopsis mesophyll protoplasts . to verify whether a biologically functional form of _PROTEIN_ is indeed a _LOCATION_ protein we introduced _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ into the _PROTEIN_ mutant . the successful complementation of the light hypersensitive phenotype in _PROTEIN_ indicates that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ is a functional protein in planta . immunoblot analysis also confirmed that the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was similar to that of endogenous _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signal was observed by use of confocal microscopy and was nicely superimposed with _LOCATION_ stained with propidium iodide . this result indicated that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ localizes in the _LOCATION_ . the _LOCATION_ localization and protein signatures of _PROTEIN_ imply that _PROTEIN_ functions as a transcriptional _PROTEIN_ regulating gene _PROTEIN_ . we next performed a transcriptome comparison of d old wild type and _PROTEIN_ seedlings grown under rl and _PROTEIN_ conditions . samples from d old etiolated seedlings or rl/ld seedlings illuminated with rl for h were used for transcriptome profiling . in total genes with significantly differential _PROTEIN_ between ler and _PROTEIN_ in dark or rl conditions were retrieved for k means clustering analysis . supplemental data set online shows the _PROTEIN_ data of these genes from three biological replicate samples . figure shows five representative _PROTEIN_ clusters obtained and plots of average _PROTEIN_ for genes in each cluster . the _PROTEIN_ of genes in clusters i to iii was upregulated in the _PROTEIN_ mutant in the dark . genes in these three clusters had distinct _PROTEIN_ responsiveness to rl in ler . the _PROTEIN_ of genes in clusters i and ii was downregulated by rl with genes in cluster i more repressed by rl . by contrast genes in cluster iii were upregulated by rl in ler . _PROTEIN_ may function to _PROTEIN_ optimal _PROTEIN_ of these genes by specifically repressing their _PROTEIN_ in the dark . most _PROTEIN_ regulated genes were classified in these three clusters which indicates that _PROTEIN_ primarily acts to repress gene _PROTEIN_ in the dark . the _PROTEIN_ of genes in clusters iv and v was comparable between the dark and rl in ler which suggests that the _PROTEIN_ of these genes is not regulated by light in ler . interestingly _PROTEIN_ repressed the _PROTEIN_ of genes in cluster iv but activated genes in cluster v under both dark and rl conditions . only four genes were positively regulated by _PROTEIN_ further indicating that _PROTEIN_ is primarily a negative regulator in seedling development . increasing numbers of reports describe the interplay between the signaling pathways of light and plant hormones . we next examined whether _PROTEIN_ specifically regulates light responsive genes or is involved in coordinating light and hormone signals . we compared the _PROTEIN_ regulated genes with genes regulated by various qualities of light or plant hormones . we evaluated whether _PROTEIN_ regulated genes are significantly enriched under a specific quality of light or hormone treatment by fisher s exact test . as shown in table of _PROTEIN_ regulated genes were light responsive compared with only of genes represented on _PROTEIN_ . among genes responding to qualities of light _PROTEIN_ preferentially regulated genes responding to continuous rl . also of _PROTEIN_ regulated genes were differentially regulated by treatment with multiple plant hormones . notably ga and aba responsive genes are highly represented in _PROTEIN_ regulated genes . _PROTEIN_ regulated genes responsive to light or hormones are listed in supplemental data set online . the overrepresentation of _PROTEIN_ regulated genes in response to rl ga and aba suggests a possible role of _PROTEIN_ in biological processes regulated by these external and internal _PROTEIN_ . accordingly a search for cis elements enriched in kb promoter regions of _PROTEIN_ regulated genes revealed cis elements responsible for gene _PROTEIN_ with light ga and aba treatment . in addition the enrichment of the g box and its derivatives in promoters of _PROTEIN_ regulated genes is in agreement with the binding affinity of _PROTEIN_ to the g box observed in figure . seed germination is a physiological process responding to the integration of light ga and aba signals . that _PROTEIN_ preferentially regulates light ga and aba responsive genes led us to examine whether _PROTEIN_ mutants have defects in seed germination . with a pulse of far red light _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants showed a reduced germination rate compared with col and ler respectively . the germination defect in _PROTEIN_ persisted under extended fr illumination but was less evident for the weak mutant allele _PROTEIN_ . both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants showed a marked germination defect under a pulse of rl . the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ complemented the germination defect in _PROTEIN_ thus confirming again that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ is a functional protein . the overexpression of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ resulted in enhanced germination efficiency under frp h fr or rp treatments . thus _PROTEIN_ is a positive regulator for seed germination under both r and fr light . r and fr light promote seed germination via the action of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ respectively . as expected the germination of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutant seeds was largely inhibited under fr and r light respectively . interestingly the germination defect was more severe for seeds of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ than _PROTEIN_ . thus _PROTEIN_ may be responsible for the residual germination ability in _PROTEIN_ observed in figure . this finding suggests _PROTEIN_ has a _PROTEIN_ independent function in seed germination . in comparing the results in figures and _PROTEIN_ appears to have a more important role in seed germination than in deetiolation . _PROTEIN_ a della protein and _PROTEIN_ are two negative regulators in seed germination . both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were upregulated in _PROTEIN_ mutant seedlings in the dark _PROTEIN_ . we next examined whether the germination defects in the _PROTEIN_ mutant are associated with the upregulation of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . we analyzed the _PROTEIN_ of these two genes in ler _PROTEIN_ and the _PROTEIN_ complementation line under different fr or r light regimes after imbibition . in parallel to the gene _PROTEIN_ analyses we scored seed germination phenotypes of different genotypes . as shown in supplemental figure online _PROTEIN_ exhibited delayed germination under all conditions examined similar to the results shown in figure . with a pulse of fr light the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ was markedly higher in seeds of _PROTEIN_ than ler throughout the d time course examined . increased _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ was also observed within h after imbibition under prolonged fr or a pulse of r . the negative role of _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is supported by the clear anticorrelation in _PROTEIN_ patterns of genes regulated by both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ on transcriptome analyses _PROTEIN_ . a previous report indicated that the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ was transiently upregulated in ler seeds after imbibition . in imbibed _PROTEIN_ seeds _PROTEIN_ still exhibited transient upregulation as in ler seeds but its _PROTEIN_ level was significantly increased under all light regimes . the increased _PROTEIN_ of the negative regulators _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ may explain at least in part the delayed germination of _PROTEIN_ seeds . the steadily high _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ may account for its extremely low germination rate after a pulse of fr . to confirm further the genetic relationship between _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ we generated _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutants . _PROTEIN_ was a positive regulator of arabidopsis seed germination as confirmed by the delayed germination rate of _PROTEIN_ under all light regimes tested . by contrast _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are negative regulators of seed germination . our germination assay results in figure confirmed that _PROTEIN_ germinated much earlier than col under both fr and r conditions and _PROTEIN_ germinated earlier than ler only under r possibly because of functional redundancy with _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ under fr . the germination rate of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ resembled that of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ respectively . thus _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are epistatic to _PROTEIN_ which is consistent with _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ being downstream genes regulated by _PROTEIN_ . the g box core motif is present in the promoter of _PROTEIN_ . therefore during seed germination _PROTEIN_ may repress the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ by direct binding . to test this possibility we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation quantitative pcr _PROTEIN_ assay of imbibed seeds of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ complementation lines with col used as a control . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein was immunoprecipitated with anti _METHOD_ antibody and qpcr was used to analyze the precipitated dna for enrichment of the _PROTEIN_ promoter region harboring the g box core motif . in germinating seeds compared with the wild type control _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ complementation lines showed enrichment of the _PROTEIN_ promoter fragment . direct binding of _PROTEIN_ to _PROTEIN_ promoter in planta was also observed in d old etiolated seedlings . despite the upregulation of _PROTEIN_ in the _PROTEIN_ mutant no g box or its derivative cis elements could be found in the promoter region of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ did not bind to the promoter of _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ qpcr assays . therefore _PROTEIN_ may repress the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ indirectly . we next surveyed additional genes directly targeted by _PROTEIN_ . we primarily focused on genes in ga and aba pathways because of their high representation in the population of _PROTEIN_ regulated genes . we examined eight genes in addition to _PROTEIN_ that showed upregulation in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . these eight genes carry the g box or its derivative cis elements in the promoter region and encode proteins functioning in the biosynthetic pathway of aba or signaling pathways of ga and aba on the basis of their gene ontology classification in the arabidopsis information resource database . _PROTEIN_ qpcr analysis of the promoter region harboring putative _PROTEIN_ target sites revealed that in germinating seeds _PROTEIN_ could bind with promoters of homolog b _PROTEIN_ aba hypersensitive _PROTEIN_ and early methionine _PROTEIN_ . in d old etiolated seedlings _PROTEIN_ could target promoters of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and salt tolerance zinc finger _PROTEIN_ . therefore in addition to activating the ga pathway by repressing _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ likely functions to repress the aba signaling by directly binding to the promoters of the aba responsive genes but not biosynthetic genes . to confirm that _PROTEIN_ binds specifically to promoters of endogenous genes we performed _METHOD_ experiments with recombinant _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ promoters . as shown in supplemental figure online _PROTEIN_ could bind specifically to _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ promoter fragments harboring g box or its derivative elements enriched in the _PROTEIN_ experiment . the results also showed that _PROTEIN_ had much reduced binding affinity to mutated target cis elements in both promoters . these results support that _PROTEIN_ could repress the _PROTEIN_ of its target genes via direct binding to the g box core elements . taken together in the _PROTEIN_ mutant the derepression of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and aba responsive genes may have an inhibitory role in hypocotyl elongation and seed germination as observed in figures and .
