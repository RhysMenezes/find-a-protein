lipid droplets _PROTEIN_ are cell compartments specialized for oil storage . although their role and biogenesis are relatively well documented in seeds little is known about their composition structure and function in senescing leaves where they also accumulate . here we used a label free quantitative _METHOD_ _METHOD_ approach to define the _PROTEIN_ proteome of aging arabidopsis leaves . we found that its composition is highly different from that of seed/cotyledon and identified proteins including enzymes of the secondary metabolism pathways involved in plant defense response . with the exception of the _PROTEIN_ protein we did not identify enzymes implicated in lipid metabolism suggesting that growth of leaf _PROTEIN_ does not occur by local lipid synthesis but rather through contact sites with the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ or other _LOCATION_ . the two most abundant proteins of the leaf _PROTEIN_ are the _PROTEIN_ and the small rubber _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ both proteins have structural functions and participate in plant response to stress . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are part of larger protein families yet no other members were enriched in the _PROTEIN_ proteome suggesting a specific role of both proteins in aging leaves . we thus examined the function of _PROTEIN_ at this developmental stage and found that _PROTEIN_ modulates the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in aging leaves . furthermore _PROTEIN_ overexpression induces the accumulation of triacylglycerol with an unusual composition compared to wild type . we demonstrate that although _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is naturally increased in wild type senescing leaves its overexpression in senescent transgenic lines induces an over accumulation of _PROTEIN_ organized in clusters at restricted sites of the _LOCATION_ . conversely _PROTEIN_ knock down mutants displayed fewer but larger _PROTEIN_ . together our results reveal that the abundancy of _PROTEIN_ regulates the neo formation of _PROTEIN_ during senescence . using electron tomography we further provide evidence that _PROTEIN_ in leaves share tenuous physical continuity as well as numerous contact sites with the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . thus our data suggest that leaf _PROTEIN_ are functionally distinct from seed _PROTEIN_ and that their biogenesis is strictly controlled by _PROTEIN_ at restricted sites of the _LOCATION_ .
_PROTEIN_ have been described to accumulate in senescing leaves _PROTEIN_ therefore we chose to harvest aging leaves from to week old arabidopsis plants as starting material for the isolation of leaf _PROTEIN_ . arabidopsis of this age grown at high density display a mix of green purple red and yellow leaves reminiscent of a stress and senescent phenotype . the accumulation of _PROTEIN_ was tested by transmission electron microscopy on chemically fixed leaves . parenchymal cells of aging leaves accumulated per cell section lipid droplets from to nm diameter while parenchyma plants of week old green leaves exhibited very little to no _PROTEIN_ . in addition to _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ we observed an accumulation of large _LOCATION_ in _LOCATION_ which was more pronounced in red leaves . this is consistent with previous studies showing that _LOCATION_ are also known to accumulate in response to a variety of stress as well as during senescence . preparation of aging leaf lipid droplet fraction

phosphatidylinositol pc phosphatidylcholine . immunoblot analysis of cell fractions using marker antibodies . proteins for total leaf membranous soluble _LOCATION_ and lipid droplet _PROTEIN_ fractions were precipitated and from each fraction were loaded on _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . after transfer to nitrocellulose proteins were probed with sera raised against binding immunoglobulin protein as _LOCATION_ marker membrin _PROTEIN_ as _LOCATION_ marker as _LOCATION_ marker and fibrillin _PROTEIN_ as plastoglobule marker . two lines of the blots were cropped for clarity reason but brightness and contrast balance were applied to every pixels of the whole blots before cropping . _PROTEIN_ were purified by successive centrifugations on sucrose gradients . because no antibody specific to leaf _PROTEIN_ was available to test the quality of the resulting fraction by immunoblotting we determined by tlc gc fid the lipid composition of the final fraction to confirm the presence of lipid droplets . the _PROTEIN_ fraction contained as expected _PROTEIN_ neutral lipids with of total fatty acids in lipid esters of fas in tag and in free fatty acids and less than of fas in total phospholipids . we also detected minor quantities of mgdgs in our _PROTEIN_ fraction . mgdgs are lipids typically associated with _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ yet their composition in _PROTEIN_ differed from that of chloroplast mgdgs in particular in respect to _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ which is an acyl moieties commonly considered as exclusively _LOCATION_ . therefore only of the mgdg present in _PROTEIN_ could be explained by a chloroplast contamination if any and a major contamination of the _PROTEIN_ sample by _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ can be excluded . in addition the proportion of phospholipids to neutral lipids in our purified fraction was similar to that of seed _PROTEIN_ demonstrating that it was _PROTEIN_ constituted by lipid droplets and contained if any only traces of other organelles . to further test the purity of the _PROTEIN_ fraction we performed immunoblot analyses using markers of the most probable contaminants _LOCATION_ vesicles that may float similarly to the _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ that could stay attached to _PROTEIN_ and _LOCATION_ the most abundant _LOCATION_ in leaves . as expected the _PROTEIN_ fraction did not show any signal with _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ markers . a faint signal was observed with the _LOCATION_ marker suggesting a weak contamination by _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . however the lipid analysis demonstrated that possible contaminating _LOCATION_ are far less abundant than neutral lipids in the _PROTEIN_ fraction . furthermore lipid esters in the _PROTEIN_ fraction were constituted of in addition to of and while arabidopsis leaf steryl esters do not contain any _PROTEIN_ . on the contrary fatty acid phytyl esters described to accumulate in _LOCATION_ are constituted by of and neither nor . this suggests a contamination of the _PROTEIN_ fraction by fapes originating from _LOCATION_ . we therefore performed immunoblot assays with a serum raised against the fibrillin/plastoglobulin a plastoglobule marker _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ fraction showed a signal equivalent to the one obtained with purified _LOCATION_ . it confirmed that our _PROTEIN_ fraction contains _LOCATION_ in addition to _LOCATION_ lipid droplets . this can be easily explained since _LOCATION_ have a density similar to _PROTEIN_ and are also purified by floatation on a sucrose gradient _PROTEIN_ . during the purification process chloroplasts were inevitably broken releasing _LOCATION_ that were then co purified with _PROTEIN_ . the plastoglobule proteome has already been well described _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ with a core proteome of proteins that can manually be removed from the _PROTEIN_ core proteome therefore we choose to performed the proteomic analysis on this fraction enriched in _PROTEIN_ and _LOCATION_ and deprived of any other major contaminants . in order to establish precisely the leaf _PROTEIN_ proteome we quantified protein abundance by label free quantitative proteomics and determined the enrichment ratio of each protein in the _PROTEIN_ fraction compared to other cell fractions . this should allow eliminating any protein unspecifically detected in _PROTEIN_ and identifying with certainty proteins specific to the _PROTEIN_ fraction . arabidopsis leaf _PROTEIN_ were purified from three independent week old cultures . in addition fractions enriched with soluble or _LOCATION_ proteins were also prepared from the same starting material . from each independent culture three technical replicates were analyzed coming from three gradients performed in parallel _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ or three different leaves . proteins within each fraction were thereafter identified and quantified by label free quantitative proteomics . the data obtained are provided in table . some proteins with a same ontology were grouped under a unique identifier when they share identical peptide sets . to be able to compare the abundance of a protein between the different fractions we followed a protocol similar to the one previously described by lundquist et al . _PROTEIN_ for the identification of the plastoglobule core proteome . first the relative _METHOD_ contribution of each protein within a fraction was calculated from its normalized abundance quantified by the label free method relatively to the sum normalized abundance of all the peptides in the fraction . the averages of relative normalized abundances from triplicates of the same experiment were determined . second the enrichment _PROTEIN_ between _PROTEIN_ and each of the other fractions was obtained for each protein by calculating the ratios of the average of relative normalized abundance in _PROTEIN_ to other fractions . next these ratios were analyzed according to several criteria to establish a list of proteins enriched in the _PROTEIN_ fraction the _PROTEIN_ leaf enrichment ratio had to be superior to this threshold was chosen deliberately low _PROTEIN_ in order to minimize the risk to exclude major _PROTEIN_ proteins that could partition between _PROTEIN_ and other compartments but sufficient to remove all abundant proteins such as subunits of the photosystem complexes . proteins with a ratio of _PROTEIN_ to soluble proteins and _PROTEIN_ to _LOCATION_ proteins inferior to were discarded . this enrichment ratio was chosen as low as possible in order to obtain the most possible exhaustive list of proteins . the resulting data identified plastoglobule proteins in the _PROTEIN_ fraction as suspected from our immunoblot analyses the most abundant being the fibrillins and . purified _LOCATION_ highly impoverished in _PROTEIN_ can easily be obtained because _LOCATION_ are isolated from purified chloroplasts . in order to clearly exclude contaminating plastoglobule proteins from our _PROTEIN_ proteome we purified _LOCATION_ from the material used for _PROTEIN_ purification in one of the three replicates and the _PROTEIN_ enrichment ratio was determined for each protein . thirty two of the thirty four plastoglobule proteins defined in nacir and were identified both in the plastoglobule and _PROTEIN_ fractions . in this assay the known plastoglobule protein with the highest _PROTEIN_ ratio was the kinase _PROTEIN_ with a ratio of . thus proteins with _PROTEIN_ enrichment ratio less than were considered as non _PROTEIN_ proteins but rather plastoglobule ones and were thus discarded . thirty three proteins or groups of proteins matching all the aforementioned criteria in at least two of the three independent experiments were considered enriched in _PROTEIN_ . we further excluded five proteins with a previously characterized _LOCATION_ localization and/or function . among the proteins assigned to the core _PROTEIN_ proteome three were already known to associate with leaf _PROTEIN_ aubert et al . described the co localization of the caleosin _PROTEIN_ with lipid droplets in onion epidermal cells and the accumulation of the corresponding transcripts in leaves especially in response to drought stress . we also identified the peroxidase _PROTEIN_ that interacts with _PROTEIN_ in leaf _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ one of the three members of the _PROTEIN_ family is also present in our proteome . the identification of these already known _PROTEIN_ proteins in the core proteome validated our approach . twenty three other proteins were classified into seven biological processes according to the mapman tool provided by the bio analytic resource for plant biology uniprot gene ontology _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ brite database

herrmann iida et al . koroleva et al . _PROTEIN_ shen et al . _PROTEIN_ awai et al . kim h. j. et al . zhou et al . _PROTEIN_ geisler et al . . to further validate our proteomic approach we tested the localization of another protein highly enriched in _PROTEIN_ according to our proteomics data . we transiently _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusions of this protein of unknown function which we choose to call atulp for unknown lipid droplet protein either alone in arabidopsis cotyledons or in n. benthamiana leaves co transformed with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ constructs . the localization of the _METHOD_ constructs was then observed by confocal laser scanning microscopy . in arabidopsis cotyledons atulp fused to _METHOD_ at its n terminal end co localized with _LOCATION_ particles stained with the neutral lipid specific _METHOD_ dye suggesting that these structures are lipid rich bodies . when transiently co _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ constructs in n. benthamiana leaves the atulp _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was localized in the same particles as _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ a protein recently shown to be targeted to _PROTEIN_ . taken together these results demonstrate the reliability of the _PROTEIN_ core proteome identity established here . localization of atulp and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusions in lipid droplets . arabidopsis cotyledons or n. benthamiana leaves _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ atulp _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ atulp were visualized by confocal laser scanning microscopy . arabidopsis plantlets were co labeled with neutral lipid specific dye . co labeling of atulp or _PROTEIN_ targeted structures by confirmed that these structures are lipid droplets . bodipy chlorophyll and trans indicate bodipy _METHOD_ chlorophyll _METHOD_ and transmission microscopy image respectively . merge indicates merge of _METHOD_ bodipy and chlorophyll _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . bar . white arrows indicate specific localization of atulp in cells _PROTEIN_ both _PROTEIN_ and atulp transgenes . among the proteins identified here as core components of the aging leaf _PROTEIN_ proteome we found three _LOCATION_ proteins which reflects the dynamism of _PROTEIN_ intracellular trafficking _PROTEIN_ . such proteins were previously identified in seed and chlamydomonas reinhardtii _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and were recently demonstrated to participate in the recruitment and shape _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in zebrafish . it is highly probable that _PROTEIN_ associate to the _LOCATION_ network to transit between organelles in leaves thus allowing lipid transfer between the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ . two proteins of the snare _PROTEIN_ system n ethylmaleimide sensitive _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and alpha soluble _PROTEIN_ attachment protein were also identified in the core proteome . snare proteins are suggested to transit from the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ or endosomes to _PROTEIN_ in mammalian cells and to be essential for _PROTEIN_ growth _PROTEIN_ . additionally the presence of _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ in the core proteome may reflect contacts between _PROTEIN_ and the _LOCATION_ . in yeast _PROTEIN_ can be targeted to _LOCATION_ to be degraded by a process resembling microautophagy _PROTEIN_ . nevertheless the abundance of these _PROTEIN_ in leaf _PROTEIN_ is very low thus their genuine association with _PROTEIN_ remains to be confirmed . surprisingly the _PROTEIN_ core proteome contains nine proteins involved in various secondary metabolite pathways associated with plant response to biotic stress . in addition to _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ involved in oxylipin metabolism _PROTEIN_ we identified three proteins which directly participate in _METHOD_ for plant resistance to herbivores and pathogens strictosidine synthase _PROTEIN_ oxoglutarate and fe dependent oxygenase and nitrile specifier _PROTEIN_ . in addition we found the farnesylcysteine lyase _PROTEIN_ that contributes to cell detoxification via the recycling of prenylated proteins as well as enzymes of the amino acid metabolism the deoxy d arabino heptulosonate phosphate synthase that participates in the shikimate pathway and a methionine adenosyltransferase _METHOD_ . the potential functional relevance of these proteins is discussed thereafter . seven proteins identified in the aging leaf lipid droplet _PROTEIN_ core proteome participate to secondary metabolism pathways . enzymes identified in leaf _PROTEIN_ are represented in black circles . pathways are represented by gray rectangles . black arrows indicate direct reactions white arrows represent indirect reactions and gray arrows depict involvement of one component in a pathway . deoxy d arabino heptulosonate phosphate synthase _PROTEIN_ strictosidine synthase _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ farnesylcysteine lyase _PROTEIN_ methionine _PROTEIN_ oxoglutarate and fe dependent oxygenase superfamily protein _PROTEIN_ nitrile specifier _PROTEIN_ peroxidase superfamily protein _PROTEIN_ . dmapp dimethylallyl diphosphate ipp isopentenyl diphosphate mep methyl d _LOCATION_ phosphate _PROTEIN_ monoterpenoid indole alkaloid biosynthetic pathway _PROTEIN_ diphosphate . _PROTEIN_ participates to the _LOCATION_ time bomb for defense against herbivory and catalyzes the synthesis of strictosidine _PROTEIN_ thereafter activated in an unstable aglycone . this aglycone is a precursor of monoterpene indole alkaloid _PROTEIN_ biosynthesis pathway _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ are critical for plant defense against biotic stress and possess a wide range of pharmaceutical properties and applications . the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ is controversial and its exact localization in a. thaliana remains elusive . it is predicted to be _LOCATION_ by the _PROTEIN_ but subcellular fractionation of catharanthus roseus leaves showed that strictosidine synthase was cytoplasmic whereas _METHOD_ microscopy pointed to a _LOCATION_ localization . the enrichment of _PROTEIN_ in the proteome of _PROTEIN_ suggests that strictosidine synthesis occurs at these organelles the _PROTEIN_ thus providing storage for the molecules before their subsequent activation . the mustard oil bomb or _PROTEIN_ myrosinase defense system implies either aliphatic aromatic or indole _PROTEIN_ . the gsl oh protein catalyzes one of the last steps of aliphatic _PROTEIN_ biosynthesis and the _PROTEIN_ of the corresponding gene correlates with the accumulation of aliphatic _PROTEIN_ in leaves . furthermore the accumulation of hydroxybut enyl _PROTEIN_ synthesized by this gsl oh in leaves provides an increased resistance to insect herbivory . all plant gsl oh are predicted to be _LOCATION_ . upon biotic or abiotic stress _PROTEIN_ are hydrolysed into an unstable aglycone which is converted in different active products such as isothyocianates thiocyanates or simple nitriles . _PROTEIN_ was shown to convert unstable aglycones into simple nitriles in vitro . a. thaliana nitrile specifier proteins are predicted to be _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ . here we point to a _PROTEIN_ colocalization of an enzyme catalyzing the synthesis of _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ . this could represent a security system favoring the synthesis of simple nitrile rather than breakdown compounds with a higher toxicity . an _PROTEIN_ activity was detected in _LOCATION_ fraction of whole a. thaliana extract suggesting that it is not specifically localized in _PROTEIN_ but may partition between both compartments . interestingly a prenyl cysteine lyase has been identified in human lipoproteins suggesting that the hydrophobic environment procured by lipoproteins or _PROTEIN_ may provide adequate conditions for lipidated cystein recycling . prenylated proteins are involved in response to biotic and abiotic stress thus indirectly linking _PROTEIN_ and plant stress response . furthermore some prenylated proteins also regulate the _PROTEIN_ biosynthetic pathway in c. roseus _PROTEIN_ . our work also reveals dahp as part of the _PROTEIN_ proteome of aging leaves a protein with a potential role in plant response to stress as both a. thaliana _METHOD_ respond to wounding and/or pathogen attacks . dahp synthases catalyze the first stage of shikimate biosynthesis which yields the three aromatic amino acids incorporated into diverse secondary metabolites such as alkaloids _PROTEIN_ or phenylpropanoid a precursor of lignin . in addition to the well established _LOCATION_ shikimate pathway some plants also possess _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ of the enzymes . for example muday and herrmann identified two dahp synthase isoenzymes in solanum tuberosum with _LOCATION_ or _LOCATION_ localizations . even though both a. thaliana dahp synthases displayed a chloroplast transit peptide it was suggested that an alternative transcription start site of transcript of dahp synthase exists possibly generating a truncated variant without n terminal chloroplast transit peptide that could target _PROTEIN_ . _METHOD_ another _PROTEIN_ enriched protein found in our study catalyzes the production of s adenosyl l methionine which participates in multiple pathways including some described hereinabove . sam is involved in the _PROTEIN_ biosynthetic pathway . sam participates in the detoxification of _PROTEIN_ sub products . as mentioned before the _PROTEIN_ catabolism generates a variety of toxic breakdown products involved in plant defense against biotic stress . in the presence of sam thiol methyltransferases catalyze the methylation of these compounds into less toxic products associated with airborne plant insect signals and plant pathogen interactions . sam is involved in the recycling of prenylated proteins when isoprenylated proteins transit throught the _LOCATION_ the prenylcysteine is methylated by an isoprenylcysteine methyltransferase with sam as methyl donor . _METHOD_ is involved in lignin biosynthesis during which sam is a substrate for multiple methylations _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . lignin itself is synthesized from products of the shikimate pathway and deposited at the cell wall in response to stress . in c. roseus the _METHOD_ isoenzymes localize in the cytoplasm and their microenvironment _METHOD_ to participate in their specialization _PROTEIN_ . in this context we propose that the presence of _METHOD_ in _PROTEIN_ of aging leaves procure close proximity with other afore mentioned enzymes thus enabling the corresponding reactions . in other words in senescing tissue the _PROTEIN_ would provide a platform where the concentration of enzymes of the secondary pathways will allow a fast and coordinated response to a variety of biotic stress . our model thus reinforce the idea proposed by shimada et al . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ for _PROTEIN_ and phytoalexins during senescence leaf _PROTEIN_ participate to plant defense by accumulating a mixture of compounds with antimicrobial properties or enzymes involved in the synthesis of such compounds . in contrast to the _PROTEIN_ proteomes of seeds or microalgae we did not identified enzymes involved in sterol or tag metabolism in leaf _PROTEIN_ . this suggests that the breakdown of tag or steryl ester does not occur at _PROTEIN_ in aging leaves on the contrary to what is described in germinating seeds leaf _PROTEIN_ do not grow by local lipid synthesis . instead _PROTEIN_ growth would occur by direct transfer of neutral lipids from the _LOCATION_ or by _PROTEIN_ fusion via for example the snare system . in leaves of _PROTEIN_ overexpressing lines we observed _PROTEIN_ in contact with or in close proximity to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . this suggests that leaf _PROTEIN_ are not isolated from the _LOCATION_ but rather share a connection that would allow for a rapid transfer of molecules such as lipids . _PROTEIN_ was the only enzyme involved in lipid metabolism identified in the core proteome of _PROTEIN_ . located at the inner _LOCATION_ of the _LOCATION_ envelope _PROTEIN_ is part of a transporter complex involved in lipid transfer from the _LOCATION_ to the _LOCATION_ . its presence in _PROTEIN_ is unlikely originating from contamination by chloroplast _LOCATION_ since we did not find any other abundant proteins from this compartment . furthermore _PROTEIN_ was also described in the _PROTEIN_ proteome of chlamydomonas reinhardtii where it was proposed to originate from contact sites established between _PROTEIN_ and _LOCATION_ envelope _PROTEIN_ . interestingly we often observed similar contacts by tem in aging leaves supporting a genuine association of _PROTEIN_ with leaf _PROTEIN_ . however additional studies are required to further substantiate and understand how this inner envelope _LOCATION_ protein could be associated with _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ . in order to estimate the abundance of each protein constituting the leaf _PROTEIN_ proteome a top quantitative analysis was carried out on the nine replicates of the _PROTEIN_ fraction . this reliable method was previously used in diverse label free quantitative proteomic approaches _PROTEIN_ . it is based on the correlation of the sum intensity of the three most intense peptides of a protein with its abundance in the sample _PROTEIN_ . results from this analysis showed that the two most abundant proteins of aging leaf _PROTEIN_ are the caleosin _PROTEIN_ and the small rubber particle protein _PROTEIN_ together constituting more than of the _PROTEIN_ protein _METHOD_ . seed _PROTEIN_ are described to contain several oleosins and caleosins to _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ structure . however in leaf _PROTEIN_ only one isoform of caleosin _PROTEIN_ was detected . _PROTEIN_ is believed to play structural role in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . in addition _PROTEIN_ has a peroxigenase activity and is involved in oxylipin biosynthesis together with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . interestingly we found that _PROTEIN_ is over a times more abundant than _PROTEIN_ in the leaf _PROTEIN_ proteome . this suggests that only a few _PROTEIN_ molecules are engaged in a complex with _PROTEIN_ enabling the major part of _PROTEIN_ to play a role toward structure _PROTEIN_ or other functions . _PROTEIN_ another caleosin was previously reported to localize in leaf _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ yet we did not find it enriched in our _PROTEIN_ proteome . this may reflect that _PROTEIN_ is not specifically enriched in _PROTEIN_ but partitions with other compartments as suggested by the localization pattern of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion _PROTEIN_ . alternatively endogenous _PROTEIN_ may not be present in aging leaves since it was not detected in total leaf extracts . in addition to _PROTEIN_ we found that _PROTEIN_ is highly enriched in the _PROTEIN_ proteome of aging leaves . _PROTEIN_ is part of the small rubber particle family constituted of members which was recently characterized to localize in vegetative _PROTEIN_ . interestingly we only detected _PROTEIN_ in our proteome suggesting that this protein has an unsuspected specific role in aging leaves compared to _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . protein abundance in aging leaf _PROTEIN_ determined by method . biological process according to mapman . uniprot gene ontology and _PROTEIN_ brite database . protein uniprot identifier . gene identifier from tair database . protein name according to tair database . average of normalized abundance in _PROTEIN_ estimated by method for the three experiments . average of protein _METHOD_ contribution in _PROTEIN_ . the high content of _PROTEIN_ in aging leaf _PROTEIN_ prompted us to explore its function in these compartments . we thus generated arabidopsis lines overexpressing _PROTEIN_ fused to _METHOD_ tags . the overexpression of the transgenes in leaves was confirmed by quantitative rt pcr . we also obtained two t dna insertional mutants of _PROTEIN_ from the _PROTEIN_ . basal transcript levels of _PROTEIN_ were detected by quantitative rt pcr in and week old t dna mutants demonstrating that they are knock down rather than knock out lines . because _PROTEIN_ is the most abundant protein and the unique caleosin found in leaf _PROTEIN_ we compared the _PROTEIN_ levels of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in knock down as well as in four independent _PROTEIN_ over _PROTEIN_ lines . in and week old leaves grown in the same conditions used for the proteomic approach the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ strictly follows that of _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ is up regulated in _PROTEIN_ over _PROTEIN_ lines and down regulated in _PROTEIN_ knock down lines . this indicates that _PROTEIN_ is critical for the regulation of _PROTEIN_ . both caleosin and _PROTEIN_ proteins have been demonstrated to participate in stabilizing artificial oil bodies or inhibiting their coalescence _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . their high content in _PROTEIN_ of aging leaves as well as the co regulation of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ suggest that they both play fundamental role in stabilizing leaf _PROTEIN_ structure and that the _PROTEIN_ of a strict stoichiometry between both proteins may be determinant to preserve the _PROTEIN_ structure . impact of _PROTEIN_ misexpression on _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and neutral lipid metabolism . relative quantification of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in wild type _PROTEIN_ overexpressors

number per cell area were determined thanks to the imagej software . arrowheads show significant differences compared to the wild type as determined by student 's test . measurements of _PROTEIN_ area obtained for each individual plant are presented as box plots in figure . bar in b . wt wild type columbia _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ knock down lines _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ overexpressing lines under promoter with _METHOD_ fused at the c term of _PROTEIN_ . next we assayed the localization of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ constructs using confocal laser scanning microscopy . in agreement with gidda et al . and kim et al . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ co localized with _LOCATION_ mobile particles stained with the neutral lipid specific _METHOD_ dye suggesting that _PROTEIN_ localizes to lipid rich bodies . a similar localization was observed with _PROTEIN_ constructs fused to _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ either at the c or n terminal of the protein . we further observed larger bodipy stained _PROTEIN_ structures present in cotyledon and noticed that these large lipid rich bodies are in _PROTEIN_ lipid droplet aggregates and that the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ seemed restricted to the periphery of the lipid droplet . these aggregates of _PROTEIN_ were not observed in wild type plants implying that the overexpression of _PROTEIN_ induces the neo formation of _PROTEIN_ clusters in standard growth conditions . similarly to _PROTEIN_ atulp an uncharacterized _PROTEIN_ enriched protein was visualized in clusters of _PROTEIN_ in agro infiltrated leaves of n. benthamiana . when co _PROTEIN_ in the same cell both targeted the same _PROTEIN_ clusters but not exactly at the same area of the clusters suggesting that atulp and _PROTEIN_ are not systematically targeted to the same _PROTEIN_ . this difference was even more striking when arabidopsis cotyledons overexpressing _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were transiently agro infiltrated with _METHOD_ atulp _METHOD_ atulp _METHOD_ was observed in _PROTEIN_ clusters tagged with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ but also in some isolated _PROTEIN_ of the same cell untagged by _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . this suggests that diverse populations of _PROTEIN_ with differential protein compositions could co exist in cotyledons and leaves . in cotyledons these diverse populations could correspond to a concomitant mix of seed _PROTEIN_ derived from the embryo with neo formed vegetative _PROTEIN_ . nevertheless their observation in mature leaves of n. benthamiana strongly supports our upraising idea that various specialized _PROTEIN_ coexist in vegetative tissues . to gain insight into the _PROTEIN_ ultrastructure we performed transmission electron microscopy after cryo fixation of _PROTEIN_ overexpressing arabidopsis leaves . this analysis showed an accumulation of round shaped _LOCATION_ aggregates which were never observed in wild type leaves . to confirm the nature of these clusters immunogold labeling with an antibody specific to the _METHOD_ protein was performed on cryo fixed roots of a _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ overexpressing line . labeling was restricted to these _LOCATION_ aggregates while no such specific labeling was observed in control experiments where anti _METHOD_ antibody was omitted . therefore our data indicate that the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ protein is specifically associated with these aggregates . these structures were not surrounded by a typical bilayer _LOCATION_ but a monolayer suggesting that they are not vesicles or small _LOCATION_ . similar clusters homogeneously stained by osmium tetroxide were observed in chemically fixed leaves of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ overexpressing lines . the colocalization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein with the neutral lipid specific dye together with the homogeneous staining of the aggregates by osmium tetroxide when traditional chemical fixation was used confirmed that these structures are filled with neutral lipids . moreover these data confirm that the overexpression of _PROTEIN_ is responsible for the formation of such _PROTEIN_ clusters . _PROTEIN_ clusters were often observed in the close vicinity of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . in order to obtain a better vision of the position of _PROTEIN_ in the _LOCATION_ network n. benthamiana leaves were transiently co transformed with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and a _METHOD_ marker of the _LOCATION_ hdel mcherry . as shown in figure the transient _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in tobacco leaves was sufficient to induce the formation of _PROTEIN_ clusters similar to that observed in stably transformed arabidopsis . these _PROTEIN_ clusters were mobile likely following _LOCATION_ or _LOCATION_ streaming _PROTEIN_ . _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ clusters appeared not only in contact to mcherry _METHOD_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ but even trapped in the _LOCATION_ network showing a multitude of contact sites between _PROTEIN_ and _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . unfortunately the confocal microscopy resolution is not sufficient to resolve the _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ localization and determine if _PROTEIN_ is exclusively present in _PROTEIN_ periphery or also at _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ biogenesis sites . however results of our proteomic approach as well as of our iem experiment clearly argue for a preferential if not exclusive localization of _PROTEIN_ at _PROTEIN_ . chapman et al . _PROTEIN_ proposed that in non seed tissues _PROTEIN_ originate from small _PROTEIN_ formed all along the _LOCATION_ pinched off form the _LOCATION_ and then fused to form larger droplets. however the cluster organization of _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ overexpressing lines rather suggests that _PROTEIN_ are formed at restricted specialized areas of the _LOCATION_ . leaf lipid droplets _PROTEIN_ are in close proximity with the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . _METHOD_ co labeling of leaf _PROTEIN_ and the _LOCATION_ . n. benthamiana leaves were transiently co transformed with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and hdel mcherry constructs labeling _PROTEIN_ and _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ respectively . deconvolution after confocal imaging of epidermal cells demonstrates multiple contact sites between _PROTEIN_ and the _LOCATION_ network and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_

are gold fiducials used for alignment steps during tomogram . bar nm . as emphasized by lersten et al . as well as xu and shanklin _PROTEIN_ the biology and structure of _PROTEIN_ in leaf cells still remains to be examined . while one could argue that cotyledon and leaf _PROTEIN_ are similar organelles and that _PROTEIN_ have already been described in chemically fixed cotyledons _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ the results of our proteomic analysis demonstrated that leaf _PROTEIN_ have a protein composition totally different from that of seed/cotyledon _PROTEIN_ suggesting a divergence in function and possibly in structure . the ability to cryo fix leaves was crucial to fix instantaneously the sample in a near to native state and optimize ultrastructure conservation . aging leaves accumulating _PROTEIN_ are difficult to cryo fix but young leaves only contain minor quantity of _PROTEIN_ . we thus took advantage of the induction of _PROTEIN_ formation in young leaves of our _PROTEIN_ overexpressing plants to deeply decipher the leaf _PROTEIN_ ultrastructure using an electron tomography of _PROTEIN_ in leaves of day old plantlets . our analysis showed several _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ closely opposed to each _PROTEIN_ in a conformation excluding ribosomes from these sites . given that the exclusion of ribosomes from the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ is with the proximity of _LOCATION_ one defining feature for _LOCATION_ contact sites this suggests that in leaf _PROTEIN_ and _LOCATION_ share domains reminiscent of _LOCATION_ contact sites as illustrated for example in caenorhabditis elegans _PROTEIN_ . in addition a direct continuity between the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and the _PROTEIN_ was observed in some sections with the inner leaflet of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ still separating the _PROTEIN_ from the _LOCATION_ lumen . this site representing a specialized _LOCATION_ domain for _PROTEIN_ formation is highly restricted with a _PROTEIN_ of only a few tens of nm . we propose that this connection together with multiple contact sites allow the transit of metabolites between the two compartments in particular the _PROTEIN_ accumulation of tags synthesized at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ as previously demonstrated in yeast and mammalian cells _PROTEIN_ . given the numerous contact sites observed between _PROTEIN_ and the _LOCATION_ in _PROTEIN_ overexpressing leaves one can wonder why no _LOCATION_ protein originating from _LOCATION_ remnants were identified in the _PROTEIN_ fraction . it probably reflects that _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ connections in wild type plants are highly labile and dynamic which is indispensable to allow _PROTEIN_ intracellular motion _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ of a same cluster seemed also appressed to each other rather than simply side by side . by electron tomography of a restricted volume interconnections between some _PROTEIN_ could be observed suggesting either that newly formed _PROTEIN_ could bud from pre existing one or that when a _PROTEIN_ reaches its optimal size the formation of a new one is induced at the exact same site of the _LOCATION_ . the first _PROTEIN_ does not detach from the following one leading to the formation of these clusters of interconnected _PROTEIN_ . yet the existence of such an interconnection between two _PROTEIN_ in wild type leaf remains to be proven . finally multiple _PROTEIN_ like vesicles were observed by electron tomography in the vicinity of the _PROTEIN_ clusters . the identity of these vesicles remains elusive however they could participate in the _PROTEIN_ biogenesis similarly to the model proposed by kalantari et al . for animal cells where lipid droplets form in close association with _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ seeded from a _PROTEIN_ vesicle. we next evaluated the role of _PROTEIN_ on the biogenesis and ultrastructure of _PROTEIN_ under conditions inducing their formation . in these experiments plantlets were submitted to nitrogen starvation in order to induce precocious senescence . as expected nitrogen starvation induced a scattered _PROTEIN_ formation in wild type plants with an average of _PROTEIN_ per cell area _PROTEIN_ while _PROTEIN_ were scarcely observable under control conditions . the average area of a single _PROTEIN_ was with no _PROTEIN_ larger than . moreover of wild type cells contained clusters of _PROTEIN_ with clusters composed of a maximum of _PROTEIN_ . under nitrogen starvation conditions the number of _PROTEIN_ per cell area in _PROTEIN_ overexpressing line was significantly increased compared to the wild type with an average of _PROTEIN_ per cell area . in addition _PROTEIN_ were distributed in of the cases in clusters of _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ size in _PROTEIN_ overexpressing line was heterogeneous ranging from to more than yet this was not statistically significantly different from the wild type . the effect of nitrogen starvation was also tested on the two _PROTEIN_ knock down mutants where it also induced _PROTEIN_ formation but significantly less than in the wild type . furthermore the _PROTEIN_ size was highly heterogeneous and significantly bigger in one knock down line compared to the wild type with some very large _PROTEIN_ . it _METHOD_ that when knock down _PROTEIN_ lines are submitted to conditions that should induce _PROTEIN_ formation no or few new _PROTEIN_ are generated and molecules usually sequestered in newly formed _PROTEIN_ accumulate in pre existing _PROTEIN_ thus leading to abnormally large _PROTEIN_ . altogether these results indicate that _PROTEIN_ is a key element in preventing the coalescence of _PROTEIN_ regulating their size and inducing their neo formation in senescent leaves . the induced neo formation of _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ overexpressing leaves suggests that _PROTEIN_ is able to mobilize components required for the formation of _PROTEIN_ including structural proteins and neutral lipids . gidda et al . described an increase of neutral lipid content in _PROTEIN_ overexpressing plantlets grown for days on murashige and skoog plates with an enrichment of and and no perturbation of the lipid composition of knock down lines . in order to better evaluate the role of _PROTEIN_ under conditions that naturally induce _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and neutral lipid accumulation in _PROTEIN_ we analyzed the neutral lipid composition of week old senescent _PROTEIN_ overexpressing or knock down leaves . the lipid composition of knock down lines was not perturbed but _PROTEIN_ overexpressing lines accumulated more neutral lipids in leaves than the wild type . even though lipid esters are the most abundant neutral lipids in _PROTEIN_ of aging leaves the overexpression of _PROTEIN_ specifically led to an increase of the tag and not of the lipid ester content . in the three independent overexpressing lines tags were more than three times more abundant than in the wild type . in addition overexpression of _PROTEIN_ modified the tag fatty acid composition with a significant enrichment in acyl moieties _PROTEIN_ at the expense of . by contrast the fatty acid composition of lipid esters was only slightly modified and the fatty acid composition of galactolipids and phospholipids were similar in the wild type and in overexpressing lines . these data show that the overexpression of _PROTEIN_ does not impact fatty acid metabolic pathways . further our results suggest that the significant enrichment in acyl moieties of tag does not originate from an imbalance in the homeostasis but may rather originate from recycling of _LOCATION_ galactolipids . the capacity of the cell to form new _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ to limit the recycling of acyl groups into tags . when _PROTEIN_ induces _PROTEIN_ biogenesis tag synthesis is no more limited and tag leaf content increases . an increase in tag content was similarly described in _PROTEIN_ and/or _PROTEIN_ overexpressing plants _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ is a seed specific transcription _PROTEIN_ that promotes the accumulation of tag by stimulating the _PROTEIN_ of seed specific genes . atseipins are human lipodystrophy orthologs which localize in discrete _LOCATION_ subdomains and promote _PROTEIN_ biogenesis . in _PROTEIN_ and atseipin overexpressing plants the tag fatty acid composition is modified showing an increase of and a _PROTEIN_ of contents . acyls are enriched in the _LOCATION_ suggesting that both atseipin and _PROTEIN_ promote the accumulation of _LOCATION_ derived acyl groups into tags . in contrast _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ to induce a different mechanism which would rather promote the recycling of _LOCATION_ lipids for tag synthesis . however additional evidences are needed to support this hypothesis . it is worth noting that in aging leaves _PROTEIN_ were predominantly observed in close proximity to _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ . this further suggests a possible transfer of metabolites from the _LOCATION_ to the _PROTEIN_ during senescence as already suggested for _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ or for _LOCATION_ and _PROTEIN_ in c. reinhardtii .
