the structures of the pectic polysaccharide rhamnogalacturonan ii pectin constituent are remarkably evolutionary conserved in all plant species . at least different glycosyl residues are present in rg ii . among them is the seldom eight _PROTEIN_ sugar deoxy d manno octulosonic acid whose biosynthetic pathway has been shown to be conserved between plants and gram negative bacteria . kdo is formed in the _LOCATION_ by the condensation of phosphoenol pyruvate with d arabinose p and then activated by coupling to cytidine monophosphate prior to its incorporation in the _LOCATION_ apparatus by a kdo transferase _PROTEIN_ into the nascent polysaccharide rg ii . to gain new insight into rg ii biosynthesis and function we isolated and characterized null mutants for the unique putative _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ encoded in the arabidopsis genome . we provide evidence that in contrast to mutants affecting the rg ii biosynthesis the extinction of the _PROTEIN_ gene _PROTEIN_ does not result in any developmental phenotype in the _PROTEIN_ plants . furthermore the structure of rg ii from the null mutants was not altered and contained wild type amount of rha kdo side chain . the cellular localization of _PROTEIN_ was investigated by using laser scanning confocal imaging of the protein fused to green _METHOD_ protein . in agreement with its cellular prediction the fusion protein was demonstrated to be targeted to the mitochondria . these data together with data deduced from sequence analyses of higher plant genomes suggest that _PROTEIN_ encodes a putative _PROTEIN_ involved in the synthesis of a mitochondrial not yet identified lipid a like molecule rather than in the synthesis of the cell wall rg ii .
chromosome v of a.thaliana harbors a genomic sequence that could encode a _PROTEIN_ protein referred to as _PROTEIN_ as revealed by basic local alignment search tool searches using the e.coli _PROTEIN_ as a query sequence . full length sequences for plant _PROTEIN_ proteins were also identified in oryza sativa medicago truncatula vitisvinifera _PROTEIN_ populus trichocarpa ricinus communis and zea mays as well as in the moss physcomitrella patens . the predicted translation products of these plant _PROTEIN_ genes display significant amino acid identity percentage with various _PROTEIN_ sequences of prokaryotic _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ which all belong to the gram negative bacterial family . despite these sequence similarities with the bacterial enzymes the plant proteins represent a distinct lineage which could be clearly separated from the gram negative bacterial proteins as seen in the phylogenetic tree . the amino acid sequence alignment of plant putative _PROTEIN_ indicates that _PROTEIN_ shares from to of identity with other plant _PROTEIN_ sequences . sequence identity with the gram negative bacterial _PROTEIN_ varies from to . the best rates were observed for rhizobial species with of identity and of similarity between plant and bacterial _PROTEIN_ sequences supporting a direct homology between plant and rhizobial sequences . the a.thaliana putative _PROTEIN_ is composed of amino acids and displays the two identified pfam domains glyco_transf_n from residue to and from residue to of _PROTEIN_ protein . the prediction of the structure of _PROTEIN_ indicated that the protein is composed of two rossman fold protein domains as reported for _PROTEIN_ b fold of glycosyltransferases . sequence alignments revealed the presence of highly conserved protein motifs within both plant and bacterial _PROTEIN_ . although no data are available on amino acids involved in substrate recognition and cmp kdo recognition in bacterial _PROTEIN_ these motifs may be crucial for transferase activities in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic proteins . among these the two conserved sequences and _PROTEIN_ could be involved in the binding of cmp kdo onto the _PROTEIN_ since these motifs were shown to be implicated in the cmp kdo binding site in cmp kdo synthases . furthermore the asparagine residue of the conserved pr sequence was demonstrated to be required for the transfer of kdo onto lipid a in bacteria . we analyzed the _PROTEIN_ of the genes involved in the kdo biosynthetic pathway in arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ encoding the two _METHOD_ of kdo p synthase atkbsb encoding the cmp kdo synthetase and _PROTEIN_ encoding the putative _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ analysis was performed using total rnas extracted from mature flowers _METHOD_ immature and mature leaves from wild type plants . results of transcript copy number estimations with real time quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction are presented in figure . all four genes were preferentially _PROTEIN_ in flowers and in immature leaves i.e . in plant organs displaying cell division activities . this _PROTEIN_ profile is in agreement with our previous work showing that the _PROTEIN_ promoter is strongly activated in shoot apical meristem first rosette leaves and flowers and that the tomato kdsa gene _PROTEIN_ and relevant kdo p synthase activity are preferentially associated with dividing cells in a cell cycle dependent manner . to a lesser extent the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ atkbsb and _PROTEIN_ was also detected in _METHOD_ and mature leaves . we obtained two _PROTEIN_ t dna insertion lines from the arabidopsis biological resource center designated as _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ respectively . the t dna insertion site of _PROTEIN_ is illustrated in figure it disrupts the _PROTEIN_ gene within intron . this was confirmed by pcr analyses using genomic dna as compared to control wild type plants . rt pcr analyses of homozygous _PROTEIN_ plants confirmed that _PROTEIN_ is a null allele . identical results were obtained with _PROTEIN_ mutant which is disrupted in exon . the general development and growth phenotype of _PROTEIN_ null mutants appear to be similar to those of the wild type plants . thus under standard growth conditions and in contrast to mutants altered in the _LOCATION_ biosynthesis of kdo the knock out mutation of _PROTEIN_ does not induce any apparent modifications of the plant phenotype . studying the biological function of the arabidopsis putative _PROTEIN_ is hardly achievable through an enzymatic assay since cmp kdo required for the bioassay is an unstable compound . as a consequence to determine whether this putative transferase is involved in the incorporation of kdo into rg ii we investigated the rg ii structure from the homozygous _PROTEIN_ null mutant . pectins were extracted from leaf material by treatment of an alcohol insoluble fraction with endopolygalacturonase . rg ii was separated from rg i and oligogalacturonides by size exclusion chromatography _PROTEIN_ and its sugar composition was determined by gas liquid chromatography . as shown in table i the sugar composition of the _PROTEIN_ rg ii fraction was similar to that of rg ii from wild type arabidopsis plants including the kdo content which represented . dha was also clearly detected in the rg ii fraction and its presence was confirmed by gas liquid chromatography coupled to electron impact _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . this suggests that the putative transferase _PROTEIN_ is not involved in the transfer of this kdo structurally related residue . to further confirm the presence of kdo in rg ii from _PROTEIN_ null mutants this pectic polymer was submitted to a mild acid hydrolysis taking advantage that kdo can be specifically cleaved from the oligogalacturonide backbone in mild acidic conditions . the resulting kdo containing side chain was then selectively coupled to diamino methylene dioxybenzene into _METHOD_ derivatives and analyzed by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography . as illustrated in figure a _PROTEIN_ peak was detected collected and analyzed by _PROTEIN_ assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . the observed pseudomolecular ions were consistent with the presence of a dmb derivative of rha kdo . we also investigated the structure of the side chains a and b of rg ii in _PROTEIN_ mutant . due to the presence of an acidic labile apiose residue at their reducing end the side chains a and b can also be specifically released by mild acidic hydrolysis of rg ii . b and then a side chains were successively released from _PROTEIN_ rg ii by treatment with m trifluoroacetic acid at and and structurally characterized by electrospray ionization _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . molecular ions detected in the spectra were in agreement with the structure of a and b side chains and side chain fragments according to literature data . together these findings demonstrate that the inactivation of _PROTEIN_ does not result neither in the prevention of kdo transfer into rg ii nor in any structural alteration of this pectic polymer . therefore the _PROTEIN_ gene does not likely encode a _PROTEIN_ involved in rg ii biosynthesis . sequence analysis of arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ indicates that this protein is not predicted to be a type ii protein as reported for _LOCATION_ glycosyltransferases . prediction of its cellular localization using targetp suggests that this putative transferase is targeted to the mitochondria . similar predictions were obtained for other putative plant _PROTEIN_ . to investigate the cellular localization of _PROTEIN_ this putative transferase was transiently _PROTEIN_ in tobacco leaves as a fusion protein to green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ and visualized using confocal microscopy . as shown in figure h after infiltration the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein was _PROTEIN_ located in mobile dots . to identify the nature of these dots we coexpressed _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ with a _LOCATION_ marker the _LOCATION_ cyan _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ fusion protein . while the _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ fusion protein accumulated in both _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ apparatus the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein appeared in dots that are clearly distinct from _LOCATION_ bodies . to determine whether the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ labeled structures are related to mitochondria we used the orange to specifically stain these organelles . orange is a _LOCATION_ selective dye that enters the cells and is sequestered in the mitochondria where it reacts with thiols on proteins to form a _METHOD_ conjugate . figure shows a cell _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ construct whose mitochondria are labeled with . mitochondria appear as dot structures of diameter that are highly mobile . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ accumulated in the same dots as and showed a _PROTEIN_ like labeling surrounding the mitochondria . additional localization experiments were carried out on tobacco mesophyll cells that contain chloroplasts . no colocalization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ with chloroplasts was observed . together these data demonstrate that under our labeling conditions the fusion protein _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ is localized in the mitochondria .
