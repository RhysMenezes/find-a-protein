the plant _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ is a crucial mediator of the interaction between plants and microbes . understanding how the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ proteome responds to diverse immune signaling events will lead to a greater understanding of plant immunity and uncover novel targets for crop improvement . here we report the results from a large scale quantitative proteomics study of _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ enriched fractions upon activation of the arabidopsis thaliana immune receptor _PROTEIN_ . more than proteins were identified in total with proteins reproducibly identified across multiple replications . label free spectral counting was employed to quantify the relative protein abundance between different treatment samples . over of up regulated proteins have known roles in plant immune responses . significantly changing proteins include those involved in calcium and lipid signaling _LOCATION_ transport primary and secondary metabolism protein phosphorylation redox homeostasis and vesicle trafficking . a subset of differentially regulated proteins was independently validated during bacterial infection . this study presents the largest quantitative proteomics data set of plant immunity to date and provides a framework for understanding global _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ proteome dynamics during plant immune responses .
to activate plant eti responses in the absence of the pathogen week old dex inducible transgenic arabidopsis col lines were used . the dex inducible gvg system consists of a chimeric transcription _PROTEIN_ with a _PROTEIN_ binding domain that activates transcription of target genes upon application of dex to the leaf surface . activation of eti in the absence of the pathogen mitigates confounding effects _PROTEIN_ that would be introduced using bacterial infection . gvg plants appear phenotypically normal in the absence of dex and have been previously shown to specifically accumulate transcript and protein only after dex application . the bacterial effector is a protease that undergoes autoproteolysis localizes to the pm and cleaves the plant protein _PROTEIN_ twice at the sequence vpxfgxw a molecular event that is recognized by the _PROTEIN_ resistance gene in the col background . activation of _PROTEIN_ initiates eti signaling and culminates in a hr h post dex application . _PROTEIN_ levels in col and gvg plants were monitored by immunoblotting each hour following dex application for h . _PROTEIN_ protein levels _PROTEIN_ significantly between and h post dex treatment and the h time point was selected to harvest tissue for _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ enrichment . the h time point coincides with the initial loss of leaf turgor in gvg plants . at this time point it is expected that other targets in addition to _PROTEIN_ would be cleaved from the pm and degraded . our proteomics workflow is represented in fig . . leaf rosette tissue was harvested from col and gvg plants h post dex application and the total microsomal fraction was immediately subjected to aqueous two phase partitioning to enrich for _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ vesicles . the nonionic detergent brij was used to invert the isolated vesicles and release _LOCATION_ protein contaminants . pm enriched samples were quantified and the samples were subjected to one dimensional _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ to fractionate proteins by size . each gel lane was divided into equal sections and processed individually yielding lc _METHOD_ runs per sample . x ! tandem was used to search the uniprotkb complete arabidopsis proteome database for protein identifications . all of the data from a single sample were then combined in scaffold for peptide and protein identification modeling . peptide and protein identification _PROTEIN_ was limited to and respectively . the spectrum report was exported from scaffold and used to distribute shared peptide spectra as in ref . citation using a custom script yielding a data set containing spectra and proteins . removal of common laboratory contaminants resulted in a total list of arabidopsis proteins . the complete list of identified proteins associated spectral counts and quantitative statistics is available in supplemental table . aqueous two phase partitioning is a well established method for enrichment of _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ vesicles from total cellular microsomal fractions . we evaluated the purity of pm enriched fractions isolated in our laboratory by immunoblotting with antibodies raised against known subcellular _LOCATION_ markers . when compared with total leaf and total microsomal fractions the pm fraction was enriched in the integral pm h _PROTEIN_ and peripheral pm protein _PROTEIN_ . furthermore all other subcellular _LOCATION_ markers were depleted in the pm enriched fraction indicating that pm vesicles of relatively high purity were obtained using the two phase partitioning enrichment protocol . upon completion of lc _METHOD_ and protein identifications the subcellular location database for arabidopsis proteins _PROTEIN_ was used for in silico localization of all proteins identified in our experiments . _PROTEIN_ was queried for all published experimental _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and predicted evidence of the subcellular location of a protein . all of the database hits for a given subcellular location are reported in fig . . of the proteins identified have been previously shown or predicted to be associated with the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . a previous study estimated that protein contamination from other subcellular compartments was as high as after pm enrichment using two phase partitioning followed by _LOCATION_ stripping using . because no pm stripping protocol was employed it is expected that our pm enriched fractions contain proteins loosely associated with the pm . it is accepted that no organellar enrichment strategy can achieve purity . however the localization results show that our data set is highly enriched for _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ proteins relative to other subcellular compartments . spectral counting has been widely adopted as a robust label free approach to quantitative proteomics . spc defined as the total number of observations of a protein in a _METHOD_ experiment are highly correlated with absolute protein abundance in complex samples over at least orders of magnitude . we therefore used spc as a relative protein abundance measure in our samples . table i reports the pairwise pearson correlations between all replicates of col wt and gvg tissue samples . examining the entire data set of all identified proteins we found that pairwise pearson correlation coefficients of normalized spc between replicates within a treatment were high . low abundance proteins or those that are identified infrequently with low numbers of spc are common in _METHOD_ experiments with complex samples and reports indicate that proteins identified with less than five spc are difficult to reliably quantify . we therefore focused our attention on proteins that were reproducibly identified across two or more replicates of a biological condition with an average of five spc per replicate . or of all identified proteins satisfied these criteria and were assigned to the set of reproducible protein identifications . _PROTEIN_ examination of this protein subset revealed that of the reproducibly identified proteins have previous experimental or predicted evidence of pm localization . supplemental fig . depicts the protein identification overlap across treatments and within treatment replicates for the entire data set and the reproducibly identified protein subset . as expected proteins of higher abundance were more likely to be identified across multiple replicates and most were identified in both col wt and gvg samples . to assign significance to differentially regulated proteins the _PROTEIN_ statistical framework was used to model the spc data set . _PROTEIN_ uses a hierarchical bayes generalized linear mixed effects model approach to model spc taking into account common variables associated with spc such as nonparametric data distributions adjustments for protein length and the total number of spc in each sample replicate variance associated with low spc and differential _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ assigns to each protein a significance _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ which is the ratio of the likelihood of the model with differential _PROTEIN_ over the model without differential _PROTEIN_ . thus higher bayes _PROTEIN_ indicate higher confidence that a given protein is differentially regulated . bayes _PROTEIN_ values in the data set ranged from to . thresholds to determine protein differential regulation were selected as follows bayes _PROTEIN_ > _PROTEIN_ < fold change > and reproducibly identified in two or more replicates of a biological condition with an average of five spc . additionally proteins must exhibit > fold change in at least two biological replicates of a treatment to be considered differentially regulated . lower confidence proteins were filtered using these stringent criteria . under these thresholds proteins were significantly up regulated whereas proteins were significantly down regulated . to better understand the biological significance underlying differentially regulated proteins biological process enrichment was performed using the david bioinformatics resources annotation tool . results from functional annotation clustering of significantly enriched go biological process _METHOD_ in the up and down regulated protein sets are presented in figs . and respectively . process over representation was determined relative to the background set of all identified proteins . we will highlight several processes/protein families that are enriched in significantly changing protein sets . the full list of significantly up regulated proteins grouped by biological function is reported in supplemental table . the most highly enriched up regulated processes include cellular responses to cadmium primary and secondary metabolism immune responses abiotic stress responses and proteasome mediated protein catabolism . cadmium is known to induce reactive oxygen species production in plant cells and can trigger cell death at high concentrations . the enrichment of cadmium responsive gene products in the up regulated protein set suggests that similar cell death processes may be activated during onset of hr in response to eti . as others have observed many enzymes involved in primary metabolism moderately increased during eti suggesting an increased demand for energy and _PROTEIN_ skeletons during execution of defense responses . many enzymes involved in the _LOCATION_ transport of diverse molecules such as phospholipids ions sugars and abscisic acid were also found to be up regulated . a large proportion of up regulated proteins have previously characterized roles in plant immunity or cell death regulation including those involved in calcium and lipid signaling _LOCATION_ transport phosphorylation chaperones redox homeostasis secondary metabolism and _LOCATION_ trafficking . one of the secondary metabolic processes that was up regulated during eti was the production of camalexin the major phytoalexin or induced antimicrobial compound of arabidopsis . enzymes catalyzing the final steps of camalexin biosynthesis phytoalexin deficient _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were identified as highly up regulated . protein levels of phytochelatin synthase and glutathione s transferase phi enzymes recently implicated in camalexin biosynthesis were also increased . the subcellular localization of camalexin biosynthesis is currently unknown and these data suggest that it could be a _LOCATION_ associated process . camalexin inhibits the growth of many fungi . camalexin biosynthesis during eti may protect dying tissue from invasion by opportunistic necrotrophs pathogens that derive nutrients from dead tissue . antimicrobial production at the pm near sites of transport out of the cell is hypothesized to be a common mechanism of plant defense . stress induced lipid signaling has emerged as a key regulator of cellular responses to a variety of stimuli . several proteins with distinct phospholipase activities were significantly up regulated . phosphatidic acid a critical lipid second messenger has been shown to increase during activation of eti and contribute to defense gene induction and cell death . it was proposed that phosphatidic acid accumulation during eti was biphasic with an initial phase dependent on the concerted activities of phospholipase c/diacylglerol kinase and a _PROTEIN_ phase dependent on phospholipase d activity . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ levels did not change significantly although diacylglycerol kinase was up regulated . however we identified two phospholipase d proteins _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ at increased levels . recently _PROTEIN_ derived phosphatidic acid was shown to activate _PROTEIN_ mediated reactive oxygen species production in response to aba and it is tempting to speculate that a similar mechanism could sustain reactive oxygen species production during eti . additionally proteins with phospholipase activity _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ increased significantly in pm fractions during eti . _PROTEIN_ has diverse lipid substrates in vitro and has been shown to accumulate during eti and positively regulate cell death . in contrast _PROTEIN_ activity suppresses phosphatidic acid accumulation during eti and represses hr in response to the effector avrbst . thus phospholipases with positive and negative roles in cell death accumulated at the pm during eti and lipid derived signaling processes likely play a major role in the execution of eti . the trafficking of vesicles to and from the cell _LOCATION_ is a key component of normal cellular function and plant microbe interactions . proteins involved in both endocytosis and exocytosis were up regulated during eti . snare complexes are required for immune responses and are thought to function in the targeted exocytosis of various antimicrobial compounds and proteins . we identified multiple snare complex constituents including the syntaxin of plants _PROTEIN_ n ethylmaleimide sensitive _PROTEIN_ vesicle fusing _PROTEIN_ and soluble n ethylmaleimide sensitive _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ protein _PROTEIN_ as highly increased at the pm during eti . interestingly despite the evidence that the closely related syntaxin _PROTEIN_ has functionally specialized roles in innate immune responses it was only moderately increased at the pm during eti whereas _PROTEIN_ increased to much higher levels . this observation suggests that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ may have discrete functions in plant immunity depending on the immune recognition event . enzymes involved in the biosynthesis and recycling of methionine and s adenosylmethionine were identified at increased levels during eti . sam is an important metabolic precursor for numerous bioactive compounds including the hormone ethylene . up regulation of methionine/sam enzymes at the pm may provide the precursors for ethylene biosynthesis which is known to be produced at high levels during the hr and is required for the acceleration of cell death . in support of this idea the aminocyclopropane _PROTEIN_ oxidase _PROTEIN_ which catalyzes the final step of ethylene biosynthesis was also found to be up regulated at the pm . sam is a vital methyl group donor for methylation reactions in cellular metabolism . several sam dependent methyltransferase enzymes were up regulated at the pm during eti which suggests that sam plays several roles during activation of plant immunity including the biosynthesis of the hormone ethylene and additional secondary metabolic processes . protein phosphorylation is a ubiquitous post translational modification for the initiation and propagation of cellular signaling cascades . many proteins involved in protein phosphorylation and dephosphorylation were significantly increased in the data set . approximately of the proteins that were significantly up regulated belong to the protein kinase superfamily . receptor like kinases _PROTEIN_ and receptor like cytoplasmic kinases represent the largest class of up regulated kinases . the damp _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ receptor _PROTEIN_ and wall associated kinase _PROTEIN_ were increased at the pm during eti . in addition the receptor like cytoplasmic kinase botrytis induced kinase _PROTEIN_ which is known to function in _PROTEIN_ responses to both the fungal necrotroph botrytis cinerea and hemibiotroph bacterium p. syringae was up regulated at the pm during eti . these data suggest that _PROTEIN_ associated signaling processes are important components of eti and that damp receptors may act to amplify immune signaling during execution of the hr . other _PROTEIN_ involved in cell death regulation were also identified as up regulated during eti . suppressor of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ a positive regulator of cell death increased at the pm . five members of the cysteine rich receptor kinase _PROTEIN_ family significantly increased . members of this family have been implicated in the activation of hr like cell death and resistance to bacterial pathogens and additional cysteine rich receptor kinases may function in the execution of programmed cell death associated with plant immunity . in addition to protein kinases several protein phosphatase family proteins were observed to increase during eti . taken together our results highlight the importance of protein kinase/phosphatase signaling during the execution of immune signaling . because _PROTEIN_ of the protease was used to initiate eti signaling it is expected that two classes of proteins would be detected at _PROTEIN_ levels in the data set proteins down regulated by activation of eti and proteins directly cleaved by . as expected we identified _PROTEIN_ and other putative targets to be significantly _PROTEIN_ . go term biological processes enriched in the down regulated protein set included photosynthesis response to light protein maturation and receptor mediated signaling . similar to the up regulated protein set there was a substantial proportion of _PROTEIN_ that were down regulated during eti . however multiple down regulated _PROTEIN_ have known roles in plant development indicating that normal developmental processes are suspended during eti . _PROTEIN_ contains two recognition cleavage sites within a larger conserved nitrate induced _PROTEIN_ domain . in addition to _PROTEIN_ it has been hypothesized that has additional in planta physiological substrates when delivered into host cells . fourteen other arabidopsis proteins share highly similar _PROTEIN_ cleavage site sequences and are predicted to localize to the pm . however evidence for mediated degradation of additional _PROTEIN_ proteins has been lacking in arabidopsis . we robustly identified four additional _PROTEIN_ domain proteins all of which change differentially . of these _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ to nearly undetectable levels in the presence of indicating that these proteins are likely bona fide targets in arabidopsis . surprisingly _PROTEIN_ was undetectable in control tissue but increased during eti . all of the observed peptides derived from _PROTEIN_ retained an intact recognition cleavage site suggesting that this protein may not be an target in arabidopsis . it is also possible that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is highly induced during plant immune signaling and that the amount of in the gvg plants is not enough to completely degrade _PROTEIN_ . previously it has been shown that _PROTEIN_ does not accumulate in the presence of in nicotiana benthamiana transient _PROTEIN_ assays suggesting that it can be cleaved by . thus may exhibit differential specificity for _PROTEIN_ domain proteins in arabidopsis and native _PROTEIN_ may not be accessible to . cytochrome represent a large family of enzymes with diverse substrates and are involved in various metabolic pathways . we identified cyps as _PROTEIN_ in abundance during eti with at least two members present from each of the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ subfamilies . of these _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are closely related but catalyze distinct steps in _PROTEIN_ biosynthesis . _PROTEIN_ substrates are primarily aliphatic aldoximes which are further processed into aliphatic _PROTEIN_ whereas _PROTEIN_ substrates are primarily aromatic aldoximes and are the precursors for indolic _PROTEIN_ . the complete absence of _PROTEIN_ and marked _PROTEIN_ in in pm enriched fractions during eti suggests that either _PROTEIN_ production is greatly reduced or occurring elsewhere in the cell . furthermore the _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ and concomitant increase in camalexin biosynthetic enzymes suggests that indole acetaldoxime is shuttled toward camalexin production at the expense of indolic _PROTEIN_ during this stage of eti . many enzymes involved in diverse _LOCATION_ transport processes _PROTEIN_ at the pm during eti including those involved in auxin calcium peptide and sugar fluxes across the _LOCATION_ . three enzymes that control auxin efflux were down regulated at the pm . auxin signaling can enhance plant susceptibility to p. syringae and plants constitutively overexpressing exhibit altered auxin physiology through an unknown mechanism . it is unlikely that these auxin transporters are direct targets but an indirect effect can not be discounted . misregulated auxin transport has been shown to suppress systemic acquired resistance immune related hormone signaling and the accumulation of various indolic metabolites including camalexin . thus it is possible that down regulation of auxin efflux pumps is an important component of eti mediated systemic signaling and/or secondary metabolic processes . the data set contains a moderate amount of proteins known to localize to chloroplasts and likely represents a source of contamination when performing two phase partitioning from leaf tissue . interestingly many proteins present on the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ appear to be _PROTEIN_ during eti . chloroplast morphology and function is disrupted during execution of the hr and it is likely the proteins that comprise the light harvesting complexes and reaction centers present on the _LOCATION_ are degraded . it is also possible that _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ surface properties change during eti disrupting its co fractionation with pm vesicles during two phase enrichment . because many other chloroplast localized proteins do not appear to change significantly in abundance the protein complexes resident in the _LOCATION_ might be specifically degraded during the onset of hr . to confirm the spectral counting data as an accurate representation of protein levels in col wt and gvg samples we used immunoblotting as a complementary method to measure protein abundance changes during activation of eti . antibodies were obtained for six proteins that were differentially regulated in response to and immunoblots were performed on the same samples used for lc _METHOD_ . densitometric analysis of the resulting bands was conducted with imagej . we were able to detect strong correlations between normalized spectral counts and immunoblot band intensity . all of the pearson correlation coefficients were high indicating that both semiquantitative measurements _METHOD_ are in agreement with _PROTEIN_ to protein relative abundance between treatment and control samples . to further validate the protein abundance changes observed in the lc _METHOD_ data and to verify that these proteins are differentially regulated during bacterial infection we monitored protein abundance changes during pst infection of arabidopsis . four week old col plants were vacuum infiltrated with mm pst or pst . under these infection conditions hr was observed in plants infected with pst h post infiltration . pm vesicles were isolated h post infiltration . immunoblots were performed on total leaf and pm enriched fractions using the same antibodies as in fig . . there was good correspondence between protein abundance changes observed in lc _METHOD_ of gvg transgenic plants and col wt plants infected with pst indicating that the spectral counting data reflect biologically relevant protein regulation . many of the proteins tested also increased in abundance in response to pst empty vector albeit to a lesser extent than pst suggesting that these proteins also play a role in plant basal immune responses . large scale quantitative proteomics studies of whole cell and subcellular enriched fractions can elucidate global changes in protein abundance during diverse signaling events . this study represents the first large scale quantitative analysis of the plant _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ proteome upon activation of an immune receptor . because of the often observed disparities when comparing gene _PROTEIN_ data and protein levels quantitative proteomics represents a valuable means to more accurately assess cellular dynamics in response to diverse stimuli . furthermore we demonstrate that combining transgenic plant lines with inducible effector _PROTEIN_ and quantitative _METHOD_ is a powerful tool for identifying proteins and processes that are targeted by individual effectors during infection . the label free spectral counting approach was found to be highly reproducible across multiple biological replicates and protein abundance changes were confirmed during bacterial infection using immunoblotting . many proteins and processes were found to be differentially regulated during eti which demonstrates the dramatic modifications to cell physiology that occur during execution of plant immune responses . significantly a large percentage of up regulated proteins have known roles in plant defense or cell death highlighting the importance of pm associated immune signaling and defense responses . the identification of many known immune regulators provides a posteriori validation of our approach to identify novel components of immune signaling and additional differentially regulated proteins represent exciting targets for future research . the execution of eti is a multilayered process that is often manifested as programmed cell death at sites of pathogen infection . left unchecked eti has the potential to be deleterious and therefore its activation and duration are tightly controlled . under natural infection conditions the hr is usually limited to one or a few cells via the attenuation of eti responses . plant mutants exhibiting defects in cell death control can exhibit uncontrolled spreading lesions upon activation of eti . proteins involved in negative regulation of cell death or defense responses such as _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ increased in our study . the up regulation of these immune signaling antagonists could reflect the repression of various immune processes to limit tissue damage . it is also possible that many proteins _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ exhibit both positive and negative roles in defense signaling and cell death depending on complex interactions with other immune regulators the stage of the immune response and the pathogen assayed . ubiquitination and proteasome mediated degradation of _PROTEIN_ and eti receptors is emerging as an important regulatory mechanism to limit immune signaling with degradation of the _PROTEIN_ receptor _PROTEIN_ occurring rapidly after activation by bacterial flagellin . we identified many ubiquitin related proteins and s proteasome subunits as significantly increased during eti which might be involved in turnover of immune signaling components in addition to general protein catabolism during programmed cell death . dynamic interplay between positive and negative regulatory _PROTEIN_ occurs during plant immunity and together these signaling components are necessary for proper activation of plant immunity . understanding how changes in immune protein accumulation/function lead to effective disease resistance is a fundamental step toward engineering crops to be more resistant to pathogens . in this study we were able to detect and quantify dynamic changes in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ proteome upon activation of the _PROTEIN_ immune receptor . these data revealed a number of differentially regulated proteins whose role in immune signaling was previously unknown . future large scale proteomic analyses of the overlap between _PROTEIN_ and effector triggered immune signaling at different times after elicitor treatment will facilitate a system level understanding of plant innate immune signaling .
all arabidopsis plants were grown in soil in a controlled environment chamber at with a h h dark photoperiod under a light intensity of . dexamethasone inducible gvg transgenic plants in the col _PROTEIN_ background were used to initiate eti . gvg plants were sprayed with dex in water containing silwett l surfactant . col wt plants sprayed with dex containing silwett l were used as a negative control . plants were incubated on a light bench at for h before harvesting tissue for _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ enrichment . three biological replicates of plants grown and harvested at different times were performed . four to week old plants were used for all experiments . _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ enrichment was performed using aqueous two phase partitioning essentially as in refs . citation and citation . the final upper phase fraction containing enriched _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ vesicles was incubated with brij detergent on ice for min to invert vesicles and release _LOCATION_ contaminants . the samples were then diluted times with and centrifuged at g for min to pellet _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ vesicles . the _LOCATION_ pellets were frozen in liquid and stored at . _LOCATION_ pellets were solubilized in laemmli buffer without bromphenol blue then delipidated using a chloroform methanol precipitation technique . precipitated proteins were solubilized in laemmli containing m urea in a sonicating water bath . protein samples were quantified using a rc dc protein assay . pm enriched fractions from control and gvg samples were subjected to one dimensional _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ using an precise protein gradient gel . the entire sample lane was excised and cut into pieces of equal size using a disposable grid cutter . in gel digestions were performed with trypsin in a barocycler according to refs . citation and citation . the digested peptides were dried using a vacuum concentrator and then solubilized in of acetonitrile trifluoroacetic acid for lc _METHOD_ analysis . separate lc _METHOD_ analyses were performed on peptides derived from individual gel pieces for a total of lc _METHOD_ runs per sample . the lc _METHOD_ system configuration consisted of a ctc pal autosampler _PROTEIN_ and paradigm hplc coupled to a ltq ion trap _METHOD_ spectrometer with a captivespray ionization source . reversed phase lc was performed by injecting of each digested peptide sample onto a trap column and desalted online . the peptides were then eluted from the trap and separated on a reverse phase michrom magic capillary column at a flow rate of using a min gradient . the _METHOD_ spectrometer was operated in data dependent acquisition mode with s dynamic exclusion enacted on m/z observed twice within s. a standard _PROTEIN_ acquisition method was used with one survey _METHOD_ scan followed by _METHOD_ scans on the most intense ions . tandem _METHOD_ spectra were extracted using bioworks and analyzed using the x ! tandem gpm xe tornado version spectrum modeler . x ! tandem was configured to search the uniprotkb arabidopsis complete proteome sequence database and common repository of adventitious proteins database . a reversed and concatenated database served as a _PROTEIN_ sequence database to determine protein false discovery rate _PROTEIN_ as in ref . citation . x ! tandem was configured to allow parent ion _METHOD_ _LOCATION_ of da and fragment _METHOD_ _LOCATION_ of da . the data were searched using complete _PROTEIN_ modification of cysteine residues and potential modifications of oxidation of methionine and tryptophan deamidation of asparagine and glutamine in round and dioxidation of methionine and tryptophan in round and allowing one missed cleavage . x ! tandem search results were imported into scaffold and all _METHOD_ runs corresponding to the same sample were grouped together . peptide identifications were modeled using the peptideprophet algorithm . protein identification _PROTEIN_ was determined empirically using hits from the reversed _PROTEIN_ database . protein identifications required two unique peptides a peptide probability and a protein probability . using these identification thresholds the data set contained spectra and proteins with peptide _PROTEIN_ and protein _PROTEIN_ . the scaffold protein report containing the protein identification probabilities number of unique peptides unique spectra and total spectra is available in supplemental table . the spectrum report was exported from scaffold . nonunique peptide spectra were distributed among potential parent proteins based on distribution ratios derived from the unique spectral count of each protein as in ref . citation using a custom script developed at the university of california davis genome center bioinformatics core facility . all uniprot kb database hits derived from the same arabidopsis tair gene identifier were added and collapsed onto the tair id to simplify data analysis . all of the uniprot identifiers corresponding to each arabidopsis tair gene identifier are listed in supplemental table . for relative protein quantification between col and gvg samples the _PROTEIN_ statistical framework was used to assign significance to differentially regulated proteins . proteins were considered differentially regulated in _PROTEIN_ if bayes _PROTEIN_ > _PROTEIN_ < and fold change > and if the proteins were identified in at least two replicates of a particular treatment with an average of at least five spectral counts per replicate . david bioinformatics resources version was used to detect gene ontology biological process over representation in the up and down regulated protein groups using all identified proteins as the background set . the david functional annotation clustering tool was used to cluster enriched _METHOD_ using a similarity threshold of . the most significant representative term from each cluster with p < was reported . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and immunoblotting were performed according to standard procedures . the following antibodies were used at the indicated concentrations rabbit anti _PROTEIN_ rabbit anti _PROTEIN_ rabbit anti mouse anti voltage dependent anion channel goat anti _PROTEIN_ rabbit anti _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ anti mouse anti _PROTEIN_ rabbit anti _PROTEIN_ rabbit anti _PROTEIN_ rabbit anti _PROTEIN_ and rabbit anti _PROTEIN_ . secondary goat anti rabbit igg hrp goat anti mouse igg hrp bovine anti goat igg hrp or goat anti _PROTEIN_ igy hrp conjugates were used at a concentration of for detection using enhanced chemiluminescence . x ray film from immunoblotting was scanned using an office photo scanner set to grayscale at and exported in .tif format . imagej was used for densitometric analysis of all images as in ref . citation . signal bands were outlined profile plots were generated and the area under the curve was measured in arbitrary units . all three biological replicates used for lc _METHOD_ analysis were simultaneously processed on the same protein immunoblot . pseudomonas syringae pv . tomato strain carrying the broad host range vector empty vector or was vacuum infiltrated on week old arabidopsis plants at a concentration of cfu/ml in mm containing silwett l surfactant . the plants were incubated on a light bench for h at before harvesting tissue for _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ enrichment . the experiments were performed three times with similar results .
