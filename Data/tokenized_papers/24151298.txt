_METHOD_ require light for chlorophyll biosynthesis because one reaction in the pathway the reduction of protochlorophyllide to chlorophyllide is catalyzed by the light dependent protochlorophyllide oxidoreductase _PROTEIN_ . here we report that cell growth defect _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ renamed here as chaperone like protein of _PROTEIN_ an essential protein for chloroplast development plays a role in the regulation of _PROTEIN_ stability and function . _PROTEIN_ contains a j like domain and three transmembrane domains is localized in the _LOCATION_ and envelope _LOCATION_ and interacts with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in chloroplasts . can stabilize _PROTEIN_ proteins with its holdase chaperone activity . deficiency results in diminished _PROTEIN_ protein accumulation and defective chlorophyll synthesis leading to photobleaching and growth inhibition of plants under light conditions . depletion also causes reduced _PROTEIN_ accumulation in etioplasts of dark grown plants and as a result impairs the formation of prolamellar bodies which subsequently affects chloroplast biogenesis upon illumination . furthermore in cyanobacteria the homolog critically regulates _PROTEIN_ accumulation and chlorophyll synthesis under high light conditions in which the dark operative pchlide oxidoreductase is repressed by its oxygen sensitivity . these findings and the ubiquitous presence of in oxygenic photosynthetic _METHOD_ suggest the conserved nature of function in the regulation of _PROTEIN_ .
_PROTEIN_ from arabidopsis and n. benthamiana is predicted to have a chloroplast transit peptide a j like domain and three transmembrane domains . the j domain is found in cochaperones that function as partners of the highly conserved _PROTEIN_ it is required for both interaction with _PROTEIN_ and stimulation of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ activity . homologs are ubiquitously present in oxygenic photosynthetic _METHOD_ that have _PROTEIN_ including cyanobacteria green algae mosses _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ . the jl domains of nb at and are similar in structure to the j domain of based on computational models albeit with low sequence similarity . interestingly the jl domain of lacks a highly conserved tripeptide of his pro and asp _PROTEIN_ of the j domain which is required for its interaction with _PROTEIN_ . we examined the in vivo effects of deficiency in n. benthamiana and arabidopsis using vigs and a dexamethasone inducible rna interference strategy . our analyses suggest that a null mutation of is embryo lethal in arabidopsis . vigs of nb in n. benthamiana resulted in leaf yellowing similar to the phenotypes from vigs mediated double silencing of n. benthamiana _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and nb _PROTEIN_ . vigs of either nb _PROTEIN_ or nb _PROTEIN_ alone caused no visible phenotype . real time quantitative rt pcr showed silencing of nb in tobacco rattle virus lines but not in trv lines compared with the trv control . semiquantitative rt pcr showed silencing of both nb _PROTEIN_ and nb _PROTEIN_ in trv double silenced lines compared with the trv control . differential interference contrast and confocal laser scanning microscopy revealed that the average number and size of chloroplasts in the yellow sector of trv leaves were reduced to and of the trv control respectively . chlorophyll _METHOD_ of the trv chloroplasts diminished to of the control chloroplasts . total chlorophyll content in the yellow sectors of the trv leaves was also reduced to of levels in the trv control suggesting defective chlorophyll synthesis . transmission electron microscopy of the spongy mesophyll cells in the yellow sectors revealed significantly _PROTEIN_ chloroplast numbers and abnormal chloroplast morphology in nb vigs plants . the affected chloroplasts were small and elongated and contained poorly developed _LOCATION_ . taken together these results demonstrate that nb deficiency impairs chlorophyll synthesis and chloroplast biogenesis . the dex inducible at rnai seedlings were germinated and grown on medium containing ethanol or dex . under low light conditions dex rnai seedlings were photobleached in the cotyledons accompanied by excessive accumulation of ros visualized by nitro blue tetrazolium staining . nbt _METHOD_ a dark blue formazan precipitate when in contact with superoxide radicals . under high light conditions growth of dex rnai seedlings was stunted with excessive production of anthocyanin pigments in cotyledons . when the at rnai plants were grown on soil and sprayed with dex the plants developed leaf yellowing with growth retardation . real time quantitative rt pcr revealed silencing of at upon dex spraying . to determine the subcellular localization of green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ fusion constructs of nb and at were transiently _PROTEIN_ in n. benthamiana leaves using agroinfiltration . confocal laser scanning microscopy using protoplasts isolated from the infiltrated leaves revealed that green _METHOD_ signals of _METHOD_ were detected in the chloroplasts but not in mitochondria visualized by tetramethyl rhodamine methyl ester staining . in yeast at _PROTEIN_ was localized to mitochondria and its overexpression caused bax like lethality . green _METHOD_ signals of _METHOD_ fusion proteins were detected in chloroplasts and a _METHOD_ fusion protein of nb _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ also showed a similar localization pattern in chloroplasts . to determine the subplastidic localization of immunoblotting was performed with chloroplast fractions purified from n. benthamiana leaves . immunoblotting using anti and anti _PROTEIN_ antibodies detected and _PROTEIN_ proteins of n. benthamiana respectively in both _LOCATION_ and envelope _LOCATION_ fractions . as a control for fractionation the corresponding antibodies detected _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and in the stromal envelope and _LOCATION_ fractions respectively . localization of in _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ was confirmed by proteomics studies in arabidopsis maize and cauliflower . _PROTEIN_ proteins were previously detected in both stromal _LOCATION_ and envelope _LOCATION_ in chloroplasts of light _PROTEIN_ plants similar to the dual localization of several enzymes catalyzing the final steps of chlorophyll biosynthesis . to determine whether and _PROTEIN_ interact we first used bimolecular _METHOD_ complementation . and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ of arabidopsis and n. benthamiana were _PROTEIN_ in combination as yellow _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ n and _METHOD_ fusion proteins in n. benthamiana leaves by agroinfiltration . confocal laser scanning microscopy of the mesophyll cells of the infiltrated leaves and their protoplasts revealed strong _METHOD_ _METHOD_ within chloroplasts indicating an interaction between and _PROTEIN_ proteins _PROTEIN_ of the species of origin . however bifc of at with arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and genomes _PROTEIN_ and bifc of nb with n. benthamiana _PROTEIN_ all resulted in no _METHOD_ suggesting a lack of interaction . next we performed coimmunoprecipitation assays . a fusion protein between nb _PROTEIN_ and the hemagglutinin tag and ha were transiently _PROTEIN_ using agroinfiltration and then immunoprecipitated from n dodesyl d maltoside solubilized chloroplast _LOCATION_ using anti ha antibodies . the immunoprecipitates contained the coexpressed flag proteins suggesting interaction of nb with both nb _PROTEIN_ and nb _PROTEIN_ in vivo . however ha fusions of n. benthamiana _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ could not be coimmunoprecipitated by flag consistent with the bifc results . for in vitro binding assays purified maltose binding protein fused nb and were immobilized on mbp resin and incubated with lysates of escherichia coli cells _PROTEIN_ his tag fused nb _PROTEIN_ or nb _PROTEIN_ proteins . after extensive washing of the resin bound proteins were eluted and subjected to immunoblotting with anti mbp and anti his antibodies . resin bound mbp and mbp but not mbp alone could pull down his in vitro suggesting an interaction between the homologs and _PROTEIN_ . however mbp could not pull down his . collectively these results support that and _PROTEIN_ interact with each other in chloroplast _LOCATION_ . immunoblotting demonstrated that steady state _PROTEIN_ protein levels in pale green sectors of the leaves were significantly reduced in trv vigs n. benthamiana plants and trv plants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ compared with control trv or trv nbgyrb _PROTEIN_ lines whereas the levels of _PROTEIN_ synthase subunit _PROTEIN_ cab and chloroplast _PROTEIN_ remained constant . the vigs control trv nbgyrb lines are silenced for chloroplast targeted gyrb of n. benthamiana and show leaf yellowing . thus deficiency resulted in reduced _PROTEIN_ protein accumulation in n. benthamiana . in arabidopsis silencing of by dex spraying _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ protein levels in seedlings from four independent dex inducible rnai lines compared with control samples . total _PROTEIN_ protein levels and protein levels progressively _PROTEIN_ in the arabidopsis rnai seedlings following to d of dex spraying whereas the levels of other control chloroplast proteins were unchanged . the transcript levels of arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ which are _PROTEIN_ under light conditions as well as the levels of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ remained unaffected by silencing whereas was silenced by rnai . these results suggest that is required for _PROTEIN_ protein accumulation in chloroplasts . we next examined whether depletion leads to accumulation of the _PROTEIN_ substrate pchlide caused by _PROTEIN_ deficiency by measuring _METHOD_ emission spectrum . in n. benthamiana both trv and trv vigs leaves accumulated high levels of the _PROTEIN_ substrate pchlide consistent with _PROTEIN_ deficiency in those lines while the pchlide peaks were much smaller in the trv and trv nbgyrb control lines . pchlide accumulation was also observed in arabidopsis rnai seedlings upon dex spraying albeit weakly . to determine whether is involved in the import of _PROTEIN_ we performed chloroplast import assays . first _METHOD_ was _PROTEIN_ in leaves of trv control and trv vigs n. benthamiana plants by agroinfiltration . confocal laser scanning microscopy revealed that _METHOD_ was targeted normally to the chloroplasts in both trv and trv lines suggesting that nb deficiency did not significantly affect the import of nb _PROTEIN_ into chloroplasts . next _PROTEIN_ flag was _PROTEIN_ in the leaves of trv and trv plants by agroinfiltration . immunoblotting of the leaf protein extracts using anti flag antibodies detected only the proteolytically processed mature form of _PROTEIN_ but not its precursor form in both trv and trv lines suggesting normal import of _PROTEIN_ into chloroplasts . finally the _PROTEIN_ flag construct was transformed into arabidopsis protoplasts isolated from the at rnai plants that were sprayed with ethanol or dex for d. immunoblotting of the protoplast protein extracts using anti flag antibodies detected only the mature form of _PROTEIN_ in both dex and dex samples while the total _PROTEIN_ protein level was reduced . these results suggest that chloroplast import of _PROTEIN_ was unaffected by at silencing . taken together these results suggest that is required for _PROTEIN_ stability rather than for import of _PROTEIN_ into chloroplasts . consistent with the protective function of for _PROTEIN_ we found that _PROTEIN_ proteins were susceptible to photooxidative stress . wild type n. benthamiana plants in the eight leaf stage grown under normal light conditions were transferred to high light intensity and incubated for to h. the plants did not exhibit any visible _METHOD_ until h of treatment but after h showed a leaf yellowing phenotype particularly in older leaves . immunoblotting revealed that nb _PROTEIN_ protein accumulation progressively _PROTEIN_ until h despite the lack of leaf yellowing while n. benthamiana _PROTEIN_ and protein levels remained constant throughout the period . when immunoblotting was performed with green pale green and yellow leaves collected from the plants at h of treatment and _PROTEIN_ protein levels were higher in green leaves than in pale green or yellow leaves . _PROTEIN_ protein accumulation was greatly reduced in yellow leaves at h of high light treatment . however we did not observe any increases in _PROTEIN_ protein amounts in insoluble fractions suggesting that _PROTEIN_ proteins are degraded before being aggregated under high light conditions . interestingly we repeatedly observed that proteins disappeared in green leaves but were present in pale green and yellow leaves at h. this may be due to the _PROTEIN_ that green leaves were located in the upper part of the plants and thus were exposed to higher light intensity . it has been reported that proteins are easily degraded under high light conditions . taken together these results suggest that nb _PROTEIN_ protein is sensitive to photooxidative stress . to study the effects of silencing during transition from dark to light at rnai seedlings were grown in the dark for d and then transferred to light for or h on medium with or without dex . when grown on medium with dex rnai seedlings exhibited delayed greening and anthocyanin accumulation upon illumination . real time quantitative rt pcr shows that was silenced in the dex inducible at rnai seedlings upon dex treatment during dark to light transition . this analysis also showed that the transcript level increased upon illumination consistent with an increase in protein levels upon illumination in wild type seedlings . immunoblotting revealed that illumination caused rapid degradation of _PROTEIN_ proteins accompanied by accumulation of cab and _PROTEIN_ in wild type dex and dex rnai seedlings consistent with the previous reports . compared with dex and wild type seedlings dark grown seedlings treated with dex had less _PROTEIN_ accumulation in etioplasts and delayed accumulation of the photosynthesis related proteins upon illumination consistent with the delayed greening phenotype . transcription profiles demonstrated no effect of dex on _PROTEIN_ profiles of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were downregulated by light while _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were induced by light . tem observation revealed that the cotyledons of etiolated dex rnai seedlings displayed normal etioplasts with extensive plbs and unstacked prothylakoids . the plb disappeared or shrank after h of illumination followed by formation of grana stacks after h. etioplasts of dex treated rnai seedlings had either smaller plbs or no plb and both phenotypes were simultaneously observed in a single cotyledon cell . approximately of dex etioplasts lacked a plb while only of dex etioplasts lacked a plb . analyses of tem pictures of the cotyledon sections using image j software demonstrated that the average ratio of plb area to etioplast area was in dex and in dex etioplasts suggesting reduced plb size in deficient etioplasts . furthermore the _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ in dex treated etioplasts developed poorly even after h of illumination and many _LOCATION_ were degenerating by that time . dark grown arabidopsis seedlings that have defects in _PROTEIN_ accumulation in etioplasts due to downregulation of _PROTEIN_ gene _PROTEIN_ show defective plb formation . these results suggest that modulates _PROTEIN_ protein accumulation and thereby affects plb formation in etioplasts . thus appears to play a crucial role in regulating _PROTEIN_ function during dark to light transition as well as in light _PROTEIN_ conditions . we next examined whether has chaperone activity for _PROTEIN_ by assessing its ability to prevent heat induced denaturation and aggregation of _PROTEIN_ proteins in vitro . to use his as a substrate for chaperone assay we first demonstrated that purified his and nb _PROTEIN_ proteins without a his tag exhibited a similar pattern of protein aggregation in response to heat and aggregation of nb _PROTEIN_ proteins was almost completely inhibited by mbp . addition of purified mbp proteins suppressed thermal aggregation of his in a concentration dependent manner a molar ratio of completely suppressed aggregation whereas addition of mbp glutathione s transferase _PROTEIN_ or mbp fusion protein as a control had no effect . nb _PROTEIN_ is a _LOCATION_ envelope protein of n. benthamiana . mbp also exhibited chaperone activity for his albeit weakly . nb lacking the jl domain failed to prevent his aggregation indicating that the jl domain is required for chaperone activity . however the jl domain alone exhibited no chaperone activity for his suggesting that other regions of are required for the activity . these regions may play a role in _PROTEIN_ the proper conformation of for its chaperone activity in vitro . the transmembrane domain deletion mutants of nb and could not be _PROTEIN_ in e. coli . _PROTEIN_ fused n. benthamiana chloroplast _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ also exhibited chaperone activity for his but there was no significant synergism when mbp and _PROTEIN_ were combined in the presence or absence of _PROTEIN_ . thermal aggregation of his was also suppressed by mbp . taken together these results indicate that has holdase chaperone activity for _PROTEIN_ proteins and that both the jl domain and the transmembrane domains are required for full activity . we next tested whether can prevent _PROTEIN_ denaturation/aggregation induced by oxidative stress in vitro . his proteins were aggregated at upon exposure to mm hydrogen peroxide but not to water as a control and addition of purified mbp proteins suppressed aggregation of his in a concentration dependent manner . addition of mbp also protected his from induced denaturation and aggregation . addition of _PROTEIN_ as a control did not affect aggregation of his in response to . in addition real time quantitative rt pcr analysis suggested that nb mrnas in leaves of n. benthamiana plants were and fold more abundant than nb _PROTEIN_ and nb _PROTEIN_ mrnas respectively . collectively these results support our proposal that stabilizes _PROTEIN_ proteins against photooxidative stress in chloroplasts . in cyanobacteria pchlide reduction in the dark exclusively depends on the light independent dpor but the contribution of _PROTEIN_ increases with light intensity under high intensity pchlide is exclusively reduced by _PROTEIN_ . cyanobacterial _PROTEIN_ also _METHOD_ to function as a scavenger for pchlide which can cause photooxidative damage upon illumination . synechocystis sp has a single homolog . wild type and knockout mutant synechocystis strains grown under dim light were transferred to three different light conditions and incubated for to d under photoautotrophic conditions . under low light intensity both the wild type and mutant strain grew well and synthesized chlorophyll normally . however under higher light intensity cell growth and chlorophyll synthesis were inhibited more strongly in the mutant than in the wild type . immunoblotting revealed that the wild type and mutant strains showed similar patterns of light induced accumulation of _PROTEIN_ proteins under low light intensity . however under high light intensity much less _PROTEIN_ protein accumulated in the mutant than in the wild type . therefore the _PROTEIN_ stabilizing function of may be required for pchlide reduction under high light conditions when dpor activity is suppressed by high oxygen evolution . by contrast protein _PROTEIN_ patterns of _PROTEIN_ glutr _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were similar in both strains under different light conditions .
