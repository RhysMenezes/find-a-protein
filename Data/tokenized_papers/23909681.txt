pescadillo is involved in diverse cellular processes such as embryonic development ribosomal biogenesis cell proliferation and gene transcription in yeast and metazoans . in this study we characterized cellular functions of plant pes in nicotiana benthamiana arabidopsis and tobacco by cells . a _METHOD_ fusion protein of pes is predominantly localized in the nucleolus where its localization requires the n terminal domain of pes . silencing of plant pes led to growth arrest and acute cell death . pes interacts with plant homologs of _PROTEIN_ and in the nucleolus which are also nucleolar proteins involved in ribosome biogenesis of yeast and mammals . pes _PROTEIN_ and cofractionated with ribosome subunits . depletion of any of these proteins led to defective biogenesis of the ribosome large subunits and disruption of nucleolar morphology . pes deficient plant cells also exhibited delayed maturation of ribosomal rna and suppressed global translation . during mitosis in tobacco by cells pes is associated with the mitotic microtubules including spindles and phragmoplasts and pes deficiency disrupted spindle organization and chromosome arrangement . collectively these results suggest that plant pes has an essential role in cell growth and survival through its regulation of ribosome biogenesis and mitotic progression .
pescadillo is a single gene in arabidopsis and there are two homologous genes in n. benthamiana genome according to the draft genome sequence . since n. benthamiana is an allotetraploid species pes appears to be a single gene in each diploid genome of n. benthamiana . our analyzes show no knock out mutant of pes in arabidopsis t dna insertion lines . to investigate molecular functions of pes during plant development we first examined knock down phenotypes after virus induced gene silencing of n. benthamiana pes following the protocol described in appendix . we cloned three different fragments of nbpes cdna into the tobacco rattle virus based vigs vector and infiltrated n. benthamiana plants with agrobacterium that contained each plasmid . trv nbpes trv nbpes and trv nbpes contained a kb full length coding region a bp n terminal region and a bp c terminal region of the cdna respectively . vigs with all of the trv nbpes constructs resulted in growth arrest and abnormal leaf development . the affected leaves of the trv nbpes plants were small wrinkled and distorted and contained localized yellow patches . real time quantitative rt pcr using the primers shown in table revealed significantly lower levels of endogenous nbpes transcripts in the leaves of trv nbpes trv nbpes and trv nbpes vigs plants indicating silencing of nbpes . to observe the cellular effects of pes down regulation in arabidopsis we generated transgenic arabidopsis plants which each carried an _PROTEIN_ rnai construct that had an inverted repeat of a bp _PROTEIN_ cdna fragment under the control of a dexamethasone inducible transcription system . inducible rnai system can be useful to assess functions of the genes that are essential for basic cell function or development . in dex inducible _PROTEIN_ rnai lines rnai was induced either by germinating seeds on murashige and skoog _METHOD_ medium that contained dex or by germinating seeds on _METHOD_ media and then transferring seedlings to dex media for further growth . as a control the rnai seeds were treated with ethanol in a similar way . when sowed on dex media shoot growth of seedlings of two independent _PROTEIN_ rnai lines was immediately arrested after germination and perished prematurely without true leaf formation . when the rnai seedlings were grown on _METHOD_ medium and transferred to dex medium for further growth they exhibited growth arrest death of the aerial tissues and swollen root tips . confocal laser scanning microscopy of the root tips after propidium iodide staining showed swollen and disorganized cells suggesting significant defects in cell proliferation and expansion . dark grown _PROTEIN_ rnai seedlings were also defective in hypocotyl elongation . these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ is critical for early growth and development in plants . the effect of rnai on _PROTEIN_ mrna levels in the light grown seedlings was determined by real time quantitative rt pcr . after transfer to dex media for either or days seedlings of the rnai lines exhibited significantly reduced _PROTEIN_ transcript levels as compared to dex samples whereas the transcript levels in wild type col plants remained unchanged by dex treatment . according to kang et al . transgenic arabidopsis plants carrying the empty vector showed a range of growth defects when grown on dex medium and several lines among them exhibited severe retardation in plant growth . a correlation was found between the transcript levels of gvg _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and the phenotypic severity the lines with severe phenotypes commonly accumulated high levels of gvg transcripts . furthermore dex concentration in the medium affected the phenotype in the severe lines increasing dex concentration progressively aggravated the defects . the phenotype of the _PROTEIN_ rnai lines during seed germination was similar to that of severe vector lines in kang et al . prompting us to examine whether gvg overexpression contributed to the phenotype of the _PROTEIN_ rnai plants . we examined the gvg transcript levels using semiquantitative rt pcr in multiple _PROTEIN_ rnai lines that showed mild to severe phenotypes upon dex treatment . we found that the gvg transcript level of rnai line was similar to that of rnai and rnai lines although the rnai seedlings exhibited only a mild phenotype accompanied by minimal gene silencing . thus the phenotypic severity did not seem to correlate with gvg _PROTEIN_ levels among these lines . in addition treatment of the rnai lines with as low as dex resulted in severe growth retardation _PROTEIN_ of light conditions during seedling growth . however according to kang et al . dex treatment caused no phenotype or only a mild phenotype in the severe vector control lines . taken together these results support that _PROTEIN_ silencing is the _PROTEIN_ cause of the phenotype in the _PROTEIN_ rnai and rnai lines . however different strategy may be needed for gene silencing to completely exclude a possible effect of gvg overexpression on the phenotype . we also generated transgenic tobacco by cell lines which carried a dex inducible rnai construct with an inverted repeat of a bp nbpes cdna fragment . real time quantitative rt pcr analyzes demonstrated that dex treatment for days significantly reduced tobacco pes transcript levels in the transgenic by cells . _PROTEIN_ rnai seedlings were grown on soil and sprayed with either ethanol or dex . upon dex spraying lesions started to form spontaneously in leaves of rnai plants leading to premature plant death . their cell death was accompanied by excessive accumulation of reactive oxygen species as shown by brown pigment on their leaves after diaminobenzidine staining . dab staining visualizes hydrogen peroxide production . to examine dna fragmentation as a programmed cell death marker we used the terminal dutp nick end labeling assay an assay that detects single and double strand dna breaks by addition of _METHOD_ nucleotides to free termini of the broken dna . confocal laser scanning microscopy revealed a strong _METHOD_ signal in the epidermal _LOCATION_ of the _PROTEIN_ rnai plants after days of dex treatment suggesting dna breaks in the _LOCATION_ . in contrast tunel staining was detected neither in control samples ethanol treated for days nor in dex samples at dod . as a positive control dex plants were treated with dnase i which resulted in dna breaks in the _LOCATION_ . we conclude that rnai induced down regulation of _PROTEIN_ induces pcd in arabidopsis . dex inducible nbpes by cells also started to die soon after dex treatment as shown by evans blue staining . despite the strong phenotypes of growth arrest and abnormal leaf development however none of the nbpes vigs n. benthamiana lines did not exhibit cell death _METHOD_ indicating that young seedlings and cell lines may be more sensitive to pes deficiency . _PROTEIN_ contains the pescadillo n terminus domain at the n terminus followed by the _PROTEIN_ c terminus domain and a potential sumoylation site _PROTEIN_ . to determine the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ and its mutants _METHOD_ fusion constructs of full length _PROTEIN_ and its mutants were _PROTEIN_ in n. benthamiana leaves via agroinfiltration . confocal laser scanning microscopy of the leaf epidermal cells revealed that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was predominantly localized in the nucleolus although a faint signal was also detected in the nucleoplasm at longer exposure . n _METHOD_ however exhibited no nucleolar signal but had diffuse nucleoplasmic distribution suggesting the importance of the pes n domain for nucleolar localization of pes in plant cells . interestingly _METHOD_ was strongly detected in the nucleolus and at discrete loci in the nucleoplasm . this result contradicts reports for yeast and mammalian pes in which deletion of the brct domain completely abolishes nucleolar accumulation of pes . disruption of the potential sumoylation site of pes _METHOD_ did not affect its predominant nucleolar localization . these analyzes collectively demonstrate that the pes n domain strongly contributes and the brct domain partially contributes to nucleolar accumulation of pes . pescadillo associates with both _PROTEIN_ and to form the pebow complex in mammalian cells . yeast counterparts of three proteins _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ and interact with each other for assembly of the subcomplex in yeast pre ribosomes . these three proteins are essential and conserved in eukaryotes and _PROTEIN_ localized in the nucleolus _METHOD_ . plant databases contain arabidopsis and n. benthamiana homologs of _PROTEIN_ and . _PROTEIN_ and are single genes in arabidopsis and in each diploid genome of n. benthamiana . arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ and contain multiple repeats which serve as a scaffold for protein interactions . _METHOD_ fusion proteins of arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ and were _PROTEIN_ localized to the nucleolus . we used bifc to test for an interaction of _PROTEIN_ with arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ and in plant cells . using agroinfiltration _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and cdnas were _PROTEIN_ in combination in n. benthamiana leaves as _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ fusion proteins for confocal laser scanning microscopy . all of the different combinations of protein _PROTEIN_ resulted in strong _METHOD_ _METHOD_ in the nucleolus indicating that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and interact with each other in the nucleolus . however coexpression of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ as a control resulted in no _METHOD_ _METHOD_ indicating a lack of interaction . to further demonstrate the in vivo interaction of _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ and we conducted co immunoprecipitation assays . the following pairs were co _PROTEIN_ in n. benthamiana leaves by agroinfiltration flag fused _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and hemagglutinin fused _PROTEIN_ flag and myc fused _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ flag and ha . ha and _PROTEIN_ myc proteins were immunoprecipitated from the cell extracts of infiltrated leaves with either anti ha or anti myc antibodies . we performed western blotting first with either anti ha or anti myc to detect immunoprecipitated ha and _PROTEIN_ myc and then with anti flag antibodies to detect the presence of _PROTEIN_ flag and _PROTEIN_ flag as co immunoprecipitates . _PROTEIN_ flag was co immunoprecipitated with ha and _PROTEIN_ myc and _PROTEIN_ flag was co immunoprecipitated with ha . however co immunoprecipitation did not take place when ha and _PROTEIN_ myc were _PROTEIN_ alone . these results suggest in vivo interactions occur among _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and . we examined vigs phenotypes of n. benthamiana _PROTEIN_ and in comparison with nbpes vigs . trv and trv vigs constructs contained a bp cdna and a bp cdna respectively . vigs of and both resulted in growth retardation and abnormal leaf development similar to nbpes vigs . real time quantitative rt pcr revealed significantly lower levels of endogenous and transcripts in the leaves of trv and trv vigs plants respectively indicating silencing of these genes . to investigate the association of pes _PROTEIN_ and with ribosomes in a plant cell leaf cells that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ flag _PROTEIN_ flag or ha were fractionated on a sucrose density gradient . after ultracentrifugation fractions were collected and immunoblot analysis was performed with anti flag and anti ha antibodies . as a control for fractionation another immunoblot analysis was performed with antibodies against the ribosomal protein which is associated with ribosomal large subunits monosomes and polysomes . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and were most abundant in the fractions that contained large subunits and monosomes suggesting ribosomal association of these proteins . interestingly was also detected in the lighter fractions of the gradient suggesting that may be loosely associated with the pebow complex or may be involved in other cellular processes . recently human has been identified as a cholesterol regulatory gene although molecular mechanism of the regulation is unknown . since pes deficiency resulted in immediate growth arrest and pes proteins cofractionated with ribosomes we examined cellular protein translation activity using labeled methionine on wt and _PROTEIN_ rnai seedlings . the seedlings were grown for days on _METHOD_ media and then transferred to dex and dex media for more days of growth . the profile of radioactive proteins after brief incorporation of methionine indicated that nascent protein synthesis was significantly _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ rnai seedlings upon dex treatment . we also performed a time course analysis of protein translation in the _PROTEIN_ rnai seedlings using the methionine labeling . protein translation was progressively reduced in rnai seedlings following and days of dex treatment but the rnai seedlings that lacked _PROTEIN_ gene silencing did not show reduction of nascent protein synthesis at any time points of dex treatment . these results support that pes deficiency leads to a strong reduction in protein synthesis . pescadillo is required for rrna processing and its mutation leads to defective synthesis of rrna in yeast and mammals _METHOD_ . ribosomal rna genes in higher plants are organized in large clusters with each gene encoding the and rrnas . the and rrnas are transcribed as a large precursor that undergoes complex post transcriptional processing to produce mature rrnas . the rrna processing pathway in plants is poorly understood but it likely contains steps that are conserved among eukaryotes . however several events including the order of processing steps and the cleavage sites may be different in higher plants as recently described . we examined the impact of _PROTEIN_ depletion on nascent synthesis of rrna molecules by using in vivo utp labeling . with this method utp was incorporated into nascent rrna transcripts and resulted in three _PROTEIN_ bands corresponding to pre rrna mature rrna and mature rrna . after transfer to dex and dex media for days the levels of the rrna precursor were similar in all samples indicating that transcription of the rrna genes was not affected by _PROTEIN_ deficiency at this stage . nascent synthesis of mature rrna however was significantly reduced in the dex treated _PROTEIN_ rnai seedlings . synthesis of mature rrna was much less affected . figure presents the relative band intensity ratio of rrna to rrna shown in figure . the rrna ratio clearly shows reduced accumulation of mature rrna in dex treated rnai samples suggesting inefficient rrna processing in the _PROTEIN_ deficient nucleolus . consistent with this conclusion rrna processing intermediates were moderately accumulated in the rnai seedlings that were dex treated for days based on real time quantitative rt pcr . this is consistent with previous findings that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and deficient yeast and mammalian cells accumulate only very small amounts of rrna precursors _METHOD_ . interestingly rnai seedlings incubated for days on dex medium showed defects in nascent synthesis of both the pre rrna and the mature and rrnas although the seedlings did not exhibit any visible cell death _METHOD_ at this stage . these results suggest that further perturbation of nucleolar function started to affect both rdna transcription and overall rrna processing . finally further treatment with dex resulted in a _PROTEIN_ in total cellular and rrnas suggesting rrna degradation . to investigate a potential role of pes _PROTEIN_ and in ribosome biogenesis we performed ribosome profiling in n. benthamiana vigs plants . cell extracts were prepared from trv trv nbpes trv and trv leaves and fractionated with sucrose density ultracentrifugation and the resulting ribosome profile was measured at nm . peak height detected by nm indicated the level of each ribosomal species in each sample . depletion of nbpes and each resulted in severe consequences on ribosomal species . compared to the trv control accumulation of large subunits was significantly reduced in cells while accumulation of small subunits increased . the amount of monosomes was also reduced probably due to the blocked assembly of functional subunits . in addition accumulation of polysomes was also disrupted in trv nbpes trv and trv cells indicating repression of global protein translation activity . in summary depletion of pes _PROTEIN_ and caused defective biogenesis of the ribosome large subunit and a strong reduction in protein synthesis of plant cells . it has been known that the formation of the nucleolus requires transcription . however the _METHOD_ of forming a defined structure of the nucleolus from the various nucleolar components are not well understood . previously defective pes function resulted in disrupted nucleologenesis during mouse embryo development . we compared nucleolar morphology of leaf epidermal cells from trv nbpes trv and trv vigs plants to the trv control cells . to mark the nucleolus _METHOD_ was _PROTEIN_ in leaves of vigs plants by agroinfiltration . encodes a n. benthamiana homolog of the subunit of the nascent polypeptide associated complex . nac is a ribosome associated _PROTEIN_ in close proximity to nascent polypeptide chains for folding of the newly synthesized proteins . koplin et al . recently showed that nac also has a critical role in ribosome biogenesis . in a plant cell _METHOD_ is predominantly localized in the nucleolus . after transient _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ we briefly stained the leaves with dapi to mark the _LOCATION_ . confocal microscopy revealed that the leaf epidermal cells from trv nbpes trv and trv lines frequently exhibited morphological alteration of the nucleoli including fragmented nucleoli and mini nucleolus like _METHOD_ while trv control cells predominantly showed a single nucleolus . meanwhile dapi stained _LOCATION_ appeared to be normal in all of the samples . the abnormal nucleolar morphology was also observed by transmission electron microscopy using leaf sections of vigs plants . although leaf mesophyll cells of the trv control almost exclusively exhibited a single well defined compact nucleolus trv nbpes lines frequently showed small nucleolar fragments in addition to a larger centrally localized nucleolus . these results indicate that the depletion of nbpes and its subsequent defects on ribosome assembly leads to disruption of nucleolar structure . inactivation of mammalian _PROTEIN_ results in chromosome segregation defects during mitosis in human cell lines . _PROTEIN_ localizes to the periphery of chromosomes early in mitosis and during telophase it becomes associated with pre nucleolar bodies that are present in nascent _LOCATION_ . rnai of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ causes aberrant mitosis inducing multipolar spindles hyperploids cells lagging chromosomes and disorganized metaphase chromosomes in mammalian cells . no information on pes function during plant cell mitosis exists therefore we assessed the localization of pes during mitosis in tobacco by cells with immunolabelling . transgenic by cells _PROTEIN_ nbpes flag were fixed and double labeled with both anti flag and anti tubulin antibodies . confocal laser scanning microscopy revealed that red _METHOD_ of nbpes flag was predominantly detected in the nucleolus but also detected faintly in the nucleoplasm during interphase in by cells which is consistent with its distribution in n. benthamiana leaves . during prophase nbpes was found in the disintegrating nucleolus faintly found in the nucleoplasm and weakly associated with pre prophase bands . from metaphase to telophase nbpes was distributed along mitotic microtubules including spindles and phragmoplasts . during cytokinesis nbpes was _PROTEIN_ localized to newly forming nucleoli and partly localized to phragmoplasts . however based on the microtubule binding assay recombinant nbpes proteins did not bind to taxol stabilized microtubules in vitro suggesting that association of nbpes with spindles and phragmoplasts may occur through the interaction with a microtubule binding protein . collectively nbpes localization along the spindles and phragmoplasts was significantly different from preferential localization of mammalian _PROTEIN_ at the chromosome periphery suggesting the pes function during mitosis may differ between plant and animal cells . we monitored the progression of mitosis in the dex inducible nbpes rnai by cells by confocal laser scanning microscopy . the rnai cells were treated with ethanol or dex for h and then fixed and labeled with dapi staining and anti tubulin antibodies . the rnai cells were also treated with dex for days for immunolabelling . figure showed silencing of the ntpes gene in the rnai by cells after dex treatment . the number of mitotic cells in dex cells increased compared with dex cells indicating delayed mitotic progression . visible defects were observed in dex cells from metaphase to telophase . the defective mitotic cells exhibited disorganized or multipolar spindles in metaphase while chromosomes failed to align properly and instead formed a central _METHOD_ or spreaded around the spindle clusters . in addition some dex cells formed chromatin bridges in _PROTEIN_ stages . quantification by confocal microscopy revealed the mitotic defects including multipolar spindles and anaphase chromosome bridges in of the dex cells from metaphase to telophase stages . dex samples exhibited these mitotic defects in of the cells in the same stages . these results suggest that pes plays a role in spindle organization and chromosome segregation during mitosis in plant cells .
