xylans constitute the major non cellulosic component of plant _METHOD_ . xylan biosynthesis is particularly pronounced in cells with secondary walls implying that the synthesis network consists of a set of highly _PROTEIN_ genes in such cells . to improve the understanding of xylan biosynthesis we performed a comparative analysis of co _PROTEIN_ networks between arabidopsis and rice as reference species with different wall types . many co _PROTEIN_ genes were represented by orthologs in both species which implies common biological features while some gene families were only found in one of the species and therefore likely to be related to differences in their cell walls . to predict the subcellular location of the identified proteins we developed a new method pfantom which was shown to perform better for proteins in the endomembrane system than other available prediction methods . based on the combined approach of co _PROTEIN_ and predicted cellular localization we propose a model for arabidopsis and rice xylan synthesis in the _LOCATION_ apparatus and signaling from _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ to _LOCATION_ for secondary cell wall differentiation . as an experimental validation of the model we show that an arabidopsis mutant in the _PROTEIN_ gene encoding one of the _LOCATION_ localized candidate proteins has a highly _PROTEIN_ content of _PROTEIN_ acid in secondary cell walls and substantially reduced xylan _PROTEIN_ activity .
in arabidopsis genes _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are members of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ subfamilies . the nomenclature used here for the different clades in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ is according to arabidopsis and brachypodium _PROTEIN_ studies and differs from that used to designate poplar genes . these irx genes are all _PROTEIN_ in tissues with secondary wall growth and are involved in xylan backbone synthesis . to view the correlation of their _PROTEIN_ patterns across many microarray experiments we performed a scatter plot analysis using coexviewer based on the data sets related to developmental series in the _PROTEIN_ ii database . scatter plots of pairwise combinations of the three genes showed very similar patterns and strongly correlated _PROTEIN_ whereas the negative control ralf gene which is _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in tissues with primary wall growth did not show any correlation with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . to identify other candidate genes likely to be involved in xylan accumulation we used the coexsearch tool available at _PROTEIN_ ii which uses mr for evaluation of the correlation between two different gene _PROTEIN_ . shows the most highly co _PROTEIN_ arabidopsis genes obtained for each of the three baits _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . each co _PROTEIN_ list included the three bait genes as strongly co _PROTEIN_ genes and many genes were shared between the three sets of genes with a total of genes shared amongst all three data sets . venn _METHOD_ of the co _PROTEIN_ genes with each of the three individual baits from arabidopsis and rice . _PROTEIN_ profiles of the genes that most closely match with the baits _PROTEIN_ . to confirm co regulation the transcriptional _PROTEIN_ pattern of the top shared genes of the way intersection from arabidopsis and rice is plotted . the y axes show relative gene _PROTEIN_ values in base logarithm against the average _PROTEIN_ levels of each gene . the significance of this tight linkage amongst the three genes was further examined by analyzing other members of the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ families . the maximum mr range for the gene had weaker values ranging from to _PROTEIN_ when compared to co _PROTEIN_ sets for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ where the maximum mr was less than . surprisingly arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ which appears to be involved in forming the oligosaccharide at the reducing end of xylan did not tightly co _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ produced a tight network with an mr < for the most highly co _PROTEIN_ genes but this network did not overlap considerably with the network defined by xylan backbone synthesis genes _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . furthermore the _PROTEIN_ network did not include the two other known genes implicated in synthesis of the oligosaccharide i.e . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ while both these genes were co _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ genes . the values signify the mr of each of the co _PROTEIN_ genes with _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ members . thus the other co _PROTEIN_ genes have lower mr values . low values signify highly correlated _PROTEIN_ patterns . the genes shown in bold were used as baits for the final comparative co _PROTEIN_ analysis . the mrs for all genes are listed in and . to gain a better understanding of the similarities and difference between xylan gene networks in arabidopsis and in grasses we also investigated gene networks in rice . rice has ten and seven genes belonging to the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ families respectively . phylogenic analysis clearly separated the ten _PROTEIN_ and seven _PROTEIN_ genes into distinct clades with six genes in the _PROTEIN_ l clade one gene in the _PROTEIN_ clade eight genes in the _PROTEIN_ l clade and two genes in the _PROTEIN_ l clade . we examined the _PROTEIN_ of the rice _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ genes in different developmental stages using rice affymetrix dna array data . interestingly the _PROTEIN_ patterns could be clearly defined into two distinct groups . one type of _PROTEIN_ profile was strongly dependent on tissue development stage and had high _PROTEIN_ levels in tissues associated with secondary wall deposition . the other type of _PROTEIN_ profile had relatively constant _PROTEIN_ levels . for simplicity we designate these two patterns mountain type and flat type _PROTEIN_ based on the appearance in . most of the genes showing mountain type had low range of maximum mr for the gene . the high _PROTEIN_ level in tissues with secondary wall formation and the strong co _PROTEIN_ indicate that the mountain type genes are the likely homologs implicated in xylan biosynthesis in secondary walls and hence the functional orthologs of the three arabidopsis irx genes used for the analysis above . phylogenic relationship of rice and arabidopsis genes . numbers at branches indicate bootstrap values from trials . phylogenetic tree was built by neighboring joining method using clustalw . the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ genes in _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ genes in _PROTEIN_ and their rice orthologues are clearly separated into distinct clades . the mountain type _PROTEIN_ pattern of the genes showing mr < for the most highly co _PROTEIN_ genes . the flat type _PROTEIN_ pattern of the genes which showed mr > or had no co _PROTEIN_ data available in _PROTEIN_ ii . is included in the mountain type because it has a similar profile although no co _PROTEIN_ data are available for this gene in _PROTEIN_ ii . the red and blue arrowheads show the genes used as baits for the final comparative co _PROTEIN_ analysis . the y axes show raw _PROTEIN_ values from rice affymetrix dna array data . the x axes show tissue type r ml mature_leaf yl young_leaf inflorescence stage to seed stage to . to select the best rice candidate genes for co _PROTEIN_ analysis we identified the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ homologs that fulfilled the following criteria mountain type _PROTEIN_ profile lowest maximum mr in the most highly co _PROTEIN_ genes and maximum number of shared genes . we selected the _PROTEIN_ ortholog designated _PROTEIN_ ortholog designated and _PROTEIN_ ortholog designated and used them as baits for co _PROTEIN_ analysis at _PROTEIN_ ii . a large number of shared genes were observed in the pairwise combinations with and . combining the three genes of the highest ranked genes were shared . these genes included well known genes such as encoding _PROTEIN_ and cellulose synthase genes and which are involved in secondary wall synthesis . illustrates the transcriptional co regulation of the top shared genes for both species . knowledge of both co _PROTEIN_ of genes and sub cellular localization of the corresponding proteins contribute to our understanding of protein function and putative interactions . to date existing prediction _METHOD_ have been unable to reliably predict localization to the endomembrane system in plants . for other eukaryotes the ptarget database employing a genome wide prediction method based on location specific functional domains currently provides the best prediction for subcellular location in the endomembrane _METHOD_ . inspired by this technique we developed a predictor that utilizes protein functional domain information to predict plant sub cellular localization . the prediction algorithm required a pfam training set to establish the baseline distribution of the pfam domains across multiple subcellular locations . the most comprehensive source of subcellular localization data was obtained from the amigo database . to further improve the robustness of the training set only experimentally evidenced _PROTEIN_ entries were selected from the arabidopsis proteins found in this database . this experimental amigo data set was further segmented into groups based upon the subcellular localization associated with the annotation and pfam domain information retrieved for each protein . this analysis resulted in data sets that map any given pfam domain to an experimentally observed subcellular localization . in contrast to ptarget the developed prediction algorithm was modified to allow for more than one pfam domain to contribute to the determination of localization . the ptarget algorithm bases predictions upon pfam domains that are uniquely located in specific subcellular compartments . in arabidopsis such a method would lead to at best of the proteins being correctly localized . by accepting domains that are distributed across different localizations all loci with pfam domains can be identified . the trade off to this method is that the algorithmic detection can become overly broad and the specificity of the algorithm is lowered . the efficacy of the algorithm is dictated by the size of the training set and the number of individual pfam domains that are found in each subcellular compartment . can be used for the pfam based prediction tool . subcellular localization prediction using are performed by finding pfam domain of a given target protein . for example a bhlh protein _PROTEIN_ has a domain and the highest prediction score for is for _LOCATION_ localization . on the other hand a lrr protein _PROTEIN_ contains three pfam domains and . the highest prediction scores for these pfam domains are and for _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ localization respectively . the final prediction score for this lrr protein for _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ is then calculated as the geometric mean i.e . the cubic root of . characterization of the pfam based predictor was carried out by calculating the sensitivity and specificity of the predictor upon a non independent set of proteins . since the algorithm is highly dependent upon the number and uniqueness of pfam domains to determine localization the training set was used as a benchmark set to understand how well the algorithm would work in a best case scenario since all the pfam domains have already been seen in the training set . sensitivity across subcellular localizations ranges from _LOCATION_ to _LOCATION_ while specificity drops down to only . to illustrate the threshold dependency of the algorithm performance a receiver operating characteristic plot was used . across the different thresholds for including pfam data in the final calculation the localization algorithm _METHOD_ much better than random localization as shown as dotted line on the roc plots . this algorithm fills a specific need for the predicted localization of endomembrane system proteins . the performance of this algorithm can be readily compared to the best performing predictors as outlined in _PROTEIN_ the arabidopsis subcellular database . _PROTEIN_ contains pre calculated localization scores for all arabidopsis proteins and the sensitivity and specificity was calculated for the members of the training set for each of the different predictors . _PROTEIN_ also makes an all predictors call using a winner takes all localization call to combine the results from multiple individual predictors . a comparison of this integrated all predictors call with the pfam based predictor indicates that the most significant improvements in sensitivity over current predictors are found for the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ . in _PROTEIN_ only the _METHOD_ algorithm provides any prediction for these locations but shows a lower sensitivity rate compared with pfam based prediciton . this improvement in localization capability is likely due to the various predictors focusing on properties and datasets not well tailored to the endomembrane system . based on the improvement in the endomembrane prediction we named this prediction method pfantom and used as the pfantom tool . comparison of the prediction performance of pfam based prediction all predictors by _PROTEIN_ database

shown in . scale bar . to validate the predictions given by pfantom we selected arabidopsis proteins predicted by pfantom to be located in _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ apparatus and _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . thirteen of the arabidopsis proteins have not previously been examined for their intracellular distribution whereas the remaining three proteins _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ have been reported in _METHOD_ fusion protein experiments to be located in _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and were included as positive controls . for all proteins the intracellular localization was determined by transiently _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion proteins in nicotiana benthamiana . for comparison we also predicted localization with publically available web based _METHOD_ . as predicted by pfantom two transcription _PROTEIN_ bhlh protein _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ showed the _METHOD_ signal in _LOCATION_ . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ showed the _METHOD_ signal in small moving and oval dots very similar to what was seen with the _LOCATION_ marker _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and clearly different from the _LOCATION_ marker _METHOD_ which showed typical network pattern . we selected _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ which were both predicted by pfantom to be _LOCATION_ localized although _PROTEIN_ has been reported to be a chloroplast protein _PROTEIN_ and the arabidopsis protein does have an n terminal sequence that appears to fulfill the characteristics of a transit peptide according to the targetp predictor . furthermore we also selected two _PROTEIN_ proteins which were ambiguously predicted to be _LOCATION_ but which belong to a large family of proteins several of which are known to play a role in cell wall structure . for the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and/or _LOCATION_ localized proteins _METHOD_ fusion proteins of family and gpi anchored proteins such as _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ showed the _METHOD_ signals as a single layer surrounding the cytoplasm identical to what was observed with a _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ marker . interestingly _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ show oval dots in addition to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ signal . these dots were larger than for _LOCATION_ and we are uncertain what they represent . the _METHOD_ signal of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ belonging to the gef family which is recruited to lipid rafts for small _PROTEIN_ activation was not uniformly distributed but observed as large dots associated within the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ suggesting an interaction with endogenous _LOCATION_ proteins . the results show that for of the proteins i.e . all the _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ proteins and for the pgsip proteins there was agreement between the predicted location by pfantom and the observed localization . sixteen co _PROTEIN_ genes were selected and intracellular localization was predicted by ipsort mitoprot ii predotar and _METHOD_ . pfam was the prediction method described in this study and experimental data are shown in . nc

integrate the localization predictions based on pfam and the co _PROTEIN_ information from arabidopsis and rice we examined the pfam domain information from the intersection sets identified in the previous sections comprising and genes for arabidopsis and rice respectively . outlines the pfam annotations in the high ranking co _PROTEIN_ sets showing an average mr of less than . interestingly many of the pfam domains were identified in both co _PROTEIN_ sets suggesting functional components present in both arabidopsis and rice . furthermore several sets of pfam annotations were unique to either arabidopsis or rice and likely relate to distinct features of their cell walls . lastly to obtain an insight into the putative functional interaction at the subcellular level the localization of high ranking co _PROTEIN_ components in were predicted by the pfantom . outlines the putative intracellular distribution of each pfam domain from the co _PROTEIN_ set . the majority of proteins from this collection of tightly co _PROTEIN_ genes could be assigned to three distinct intracellular compartments the _LOCATION_ apparatus the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and the _LOCATION_ . this information assisted modeling of potential interactions in the context of shared subcellular localization . an intracellular working model was constructed outlining common and unique machinery in both arabidopsis and rice . xylan synthesis candidates in _LOCATION_ apparatus . the components in this model correspond to . in general only the larger gene family name is shown except for _PROTEIN_ and epimerases which have many members of different molecular function and include pgsip _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and uxs . three gray color components _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and pgsip proteins were identified as co _PROTEIN_ genes unique to arabidopsis or rice . signaling and regulatory components on the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ to _LOCATION_ in mammals arabidopsis and rice . the components in this model correspond to genes outlined in . proteins with a predicted location score more than with common functional domain group in mammals and plants were selected as the components on _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . for the _LOCATION_ proteins with functional domain typically annotated as transcription _PROTEIN_ and with a predicted location score greater than are shown in this model . groups of protein with the same pfam domains were found in co _PROTEIN_ dataset . the table shows groups where at least one gene exhibited an average mr of less than . the number of genes corresponding to each pfam is from the entire co _PROTEIN_ set in arabidopsis and rice . the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ codes are listed in . the predicted location and score are shown according to the pfam based predictor . abbreviations for subcellular compartments are the same as in . a and proteins have been observed in _LOCATION_ apparatus . based on the references they were categorized into _LOCATION_ apparatus although they showed a low score by pfantom . the co _PROTEIN_ analysis identified a number of _PROTEIN_ located in the _LOCATION_ apparatus . most of these were the irx genes already known to be involved in xylan biosynthesis . the four additional _PROTEIN_ groups identified were _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in rice _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis and _PROTEIN_ proteins in both species but most highly co _PROTEIN_ in rice . the rice _PROTEIN_ have been shown to be udp arabinose mutases . since arabinose is abundant in rice xylan but has not been detected in arabidopsis xylan the data suggest that _PROTEIN_ could be xylan arabinosyltransferases in agreement with earlier speculations . the _PROTEIN_ proteins do not have an obvious suggested function but they may be involved in synthesis of arabinogalactan proteins e.g . the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ proteins that are also seen in the co _PROTEIN_ data sets . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ proteins belong to _PROTEIN_ family which in contrast to _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ contains retaining enzymes . pgsip proteins are only distantly related to the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ proteins . therefore the most obvious function of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ would be as xylan _PROTEIN_ given that a major difference between rice and arabidopsis secondary walls is the fold higher glca/xyl ratio in arabidopsis . to test this hypothesis we analyzed an arabidopsis mutant in the _PROTEIN_ gene which is more highly _PROTEIN_ in _METHOD_ than _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ mutant has a t dna insertion in the coding region and plants carrying the homozygous insertion were selected by pcr . no functional transcript could be detected in plants homozygous for the insertion . although no morphological or irx phenotype was observed for the _PROTEIN_ mutant line the monosaccharide composition of cell walls from _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ revealed a highly significant reduction in the content of glca compared to the wild type . none of the other monosaccharides showed a difference . we furthermore tested the xylan glca transferase activity in microsomes isolated from _METHOD_ using an assay with exogenous xylohexaose as acceptor . the results showed that the glca transferase activity in _PROTEIN_ was only about of the wild type level . this data strongly supports the hypothesis that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is a xylan _PROTEIN_ . obviously it will be necessary to substantiate this hypothesis by analysis of an independent allele or complementation of the mutant . a t dna insertion mutant carrying an insertion in the third exon of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was obtained . white arrows indicate primer annealing sites used for genotyping of the plants and black arrows indicate primer annealing sites used for rt pcr . no functional transcript could be detected by rt pcr in homozygous individuals . cell wall material isolated from the first to the third internode of inflorescence _METHOD_ showed significantly lower contents of glca compared to wild type plants . xylan _PROTEIN_ activity was determined in microsomes prepared from the second internode of inflorescence _METHOD_ . data shown are mean sd with three biological replicates each consisting of stem internodes from four plants . the activity is shown in dpm where the maximal activity determined for col is about dpm corresponding to nmol glca incorporated per mg of protein .
co _PROTEIN_ information was obtained from the _PROTEIN_ ii database . source of genechip data in _PROTEIN_ ii version are the array slides from the experiments on each developing stage biotic and abiotic treatment . scatter plots of co _PROTEIN_ of two genes were made with coexviewer available at the _PROTEIN_ ii database . _PROTEIN_ ii provides the top genes co _PROTEIN_ with bait genes in both arabidopsis and rice . we used three bait genes for each species obtained the mr for each gene and calculated the average mr as the geometric mean of the three individual mr. transcript level information during developmental stage in arabidopsis and rice were obtained from arabidopsis affymetrix dna array data available from atgeneexpress at tair and rice affymetrix dna array data available from rice array database . the pfam database has a collection of unique protein functional domains based on hidden markov models . pfam domain information of whole genome in arabidopsis was downloaded from tair and for rice from the rice genome annotation project _METHOD_ . to develop the pfam domain based algorithm in plants we downloaded arabidopsis gene product information from the amigo database for the following localization _METHOD_ go _LOCATION_ go _LOCATION_ go _LOCATION_ go _LOCATION_ go _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ go _LOCATION_ go _LOCATION_ go _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ go go _LOCATION_ and go _LOCATION_ . to remove uncertain localization annotations such as by similarity or probable we restricted the gene products to arabidopsis genes with the _PROTEIN_ evidence code which indicates that the annotation is derived from experimental data . since a protein can have multiple pfam domains this set of genes encoded a total of pfam domain annotations consisting of different pfam domains . in order to make predictions about the location of un localized proteins a reference data set was established from the amigo derived data which captured the distribution of pfam annotations across the different localization go _METHOD_ . since it is possible in the training set for a single pfam to be annotated to more than one subcellular localization we define a localization ratio for a single pfam as the percentage of time the pfam annotation is seen in a given localization . for a new protein a score for a single localization can be obtained by calculating the geometric mean of the localization ratio for each of the pfam domains that it is annotated with . by calculating this score for all localizations and selecting the localization with the highest score it is possible to suggest the localization for a protein . all clones used in this study were constructed using technology . the entry clones were obtained via _PROTEIN_ reaction in pdonr zeo _LOCATION_ or through topo reaction using the pentr/d topo vector _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . the genes were cloned using cdna from arabidopsis stem as template . the reverse primers contained no stop codon to enable c terminal fusions . sequences of forward and reverse primers can be sent on request . all entry clones were verified by restriction analysis and sequencing . the binary vectors for _PROTEIN_ of the n terminal _METHOD_ fusion proteins under the control of promoter were constructed via lr reaction using the corresponding entry clones . the full length genes were cloned into the destination vectors pearleygate . marker proteins for _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ have been described previously . the gene encoding protein from tomato bushy stunt virus was used to suppress gene silencing . all vectors were used to transform agrobacterium tumefaciens strain . prior to leaf infiltration the bacteria were resuspended in as medium to . agrobacterium strains containing the _METHOD_ constructs and the silencing plasmid were mixed and co infiltrated into leaves of week old n. benthamiana plants . abaxial epidermis of infiltrated leaves was assayed for _METHOD_ by confocal laser scanning microscopy d post infiltration . a leica confocal microscope _METHOD_ was used for confocal laser scanning microscopy . all images were obtained with magnification and a glycerol immersion objective . _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ channels were acquired by simultaneous scanning using nm laser lines for excitation signals were detected between and nm . images were processed using the leica confocal software _METHOD_ and adobe photoshop . the t dna insertion mutant in the _PROTEIN_ gene was obtained from the arabidopsis biologial resource center ohio . plants were grown under short day conditions in growth chambers for weeks before they were transferred to a growth room with a long day regime . after days growth under long day conditions the first to third internodes were harvested and cell walls prepared hydrolyzed with tfa and subsequently analyzed by hpaec for monosaccharide composition as previously described . xylan _PROTEIN_ activity in microsomes prepared from _METHOD_ was determined essentially as described using udp d glca _PROTEIN_ unlabeled udp d glca and xylohexaose as acceptor in a reaction volume . products were separated by paper chromatography and analyzed by liquid scintillation counting according to lee et al . . for rt pcr total rna was isolated from frozen stem tissue using the plant rneasy mini kit according to the manufacturer 's instructions . first strand dna synthesis was performed with oligo anchor primer and superscript iii reverse transcriptase according to the manufacturer 's instructions . two were used as template for pcr using the primers _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ to amplify _PROTEIN_ cdna and ctcaaagaccagctcttccatc and gcctttgatcttgagagcttag to amplify _PROTEIN_ cdna . the pcr program consisted of min at followed by cycles of s at s at and min s at with a final extension step of min at . pcr products were visualized on agarose gels .
