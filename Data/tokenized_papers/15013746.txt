the arabidopsis thaliana _PROTEIN_ protein belongs to the p adenosine triphosphatase _PROTEIN_ transporter family involved in heavy metal transport . functional _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ phenotypically complements the cd/pb hypersensitive yeast strain but not the zn hypersensitive mutant . _PROTEIN_ complemented cells accumulate the same amount of cadmium as complemented cells or wild type cells suggesting that _PROTEIN_ carries out an intracellular sequestration of cd . a mutant of _PROTEIN_ altered in the p _PROTEIN_ phosphorylation domain did not complement suggesting that metal transport rather than chelation is involved . the fusion protein _PROTEIN_ green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ is localized at the _LOCATION_ consistent with a role in the influx of cadmium into the _LOCATION_ compartment . in a. thaliana the mrna of _PROTEIN_ was detected _PROTEIN_ in roots old rosette leaves and cauline leaves . the _PROTEIN_ levels were not affected by cadmium or zinc treatments .
the _LOCATION_ sequence of _PROTEIN_ cdna was determined and compared to the published genomic sequence . the intron/exon distribution in _PROTEIN_ shows the same organization as those of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ from arabidopsis as described previously . nevertheless the two first introns are remarkably short in _PROTEIN_ contrasting with the two large first introns of around kb in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . conceptual translation of the cdna predicted a polypeptide of amino acids with significant amino acid similarity with many p _PROTEIN_ involved in the cd/zn transport including cada from listeria monocytogenes . the few divergences between col and ws _PROTEIN_ sequences were controlled by various independent pcrs on genomic dna and cdna with subsequent sequencing of the products . these ecotypic divergences are not located in the classical _PROTEIN_ functional domains . the n terminal part of _PROTEIN_ exhibits only one degenerated hma signature of residues as defined by prosite with a replacement of the canonical motif gmxcxxc by _PROTEIN_ . this modification is an unusual feature shared with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . the amino acid sequence is also very similar to _PROTEIN_ another p _PROTEIN_ from a. thaliana along the whole _PROTEIN_ length . nevertheless _PROTEIN_ does not present the long _PROTEIN_ c terminal extension with numerous cysteine pairs and an histidine stretch a very unusual feature among the p _PROTEIN_ family . in our experimental conditions the wild type yeast strain was able to grow up to of cdcl . beyond this range the growth rate was drastically reduced and stopped for cd concentrations above . a cd sensitive mutant strain deleted for the gene as reported by was also used to minimize redundant cd detoxification processes . in the present study the strain exhibits a severe growth reduction for cdcl concentrations above . as shown in heterologous _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in the wild type strain did not enhance yeast resistance to cd . the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ fully complements the strain up to of cdcl . for latter concentrations the complementation was only partial compared to . also shows that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transformed in induced a less efficient complementation than _PROTEIN_ . it was recently demonstrated that the strain is sensitive to lead . we used this strain to test a possible pb tolerance enhancement by _PROTEIN_ . as shown in _PROTEIN_ complemented the pb hypersensitivity of for concentrations around mm . however _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ did not enhance wild type yeast resistance to pb . it is noticeable that the fusion _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ did not complement concerning the tolerance to lead . finally similar experiments were conducted to test the ability of _PROTEIN_ to enhance zn tolerance in the yeast wild type and in the zinc sensitive mutant . we found that yeast tolerance to zn was not affected by the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ even in the zn sensitive mutant . all strains that we used exhibited very similar generation times when grown without metal . in the presence of cadmium the generation times were increased depending on the plasmid and were consistent with solid medium experiments i.e . _PROTEIN_ complements and the fusion protein _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ partially complements _PROTEIN_ . the exponential growth phase was very short for the strain when exposed to cd . as a consequence differences between strains are more pronounced when considering the od at h data i.e . at the stationary phase _PROTEIN_ . to test whether phenotypic complementation is due to transport or solely to a chelation phenomenon we used a _PROTEIN_ mutant of _PROTEIN_ that we generated . asp is predicted to be the invariant residue that is the _PROTEIN_ phosphorylation site . the transport function of this mutant is therefore expected to be affected . indeed this mutant did not complement the strain phenotype suggesting that metal detoxification is grounded on _PROTEIN_ transport function . semiquantitative rt pcrs were conducted to verify that the mrna transcript levels were identical in strains _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or the _PROTEIN_ mutant . following yeast culture in cadmium containing medium cd contents were determined in yeast pellets by icp measurements _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in wild type did not change cd sensitivity compared with the control and it was not surprising to find that cd accumulation was very similar in both strains . nevertheless when was complemented by or _PROTEIN_ cd accumulations were also very similar to those obtained in the wild type . these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ does not induce cd release into the medium but rather participates in the intracellular sequestering of the metal . is indeed a transporter located in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ expulsing glutathione s conjugated xenobiotics including cadmium to the _LOCATION_ compartment . was used as a control to visualize _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ in yeast . the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was found to be very low and was not found in all cells . nevertheless when present it was always found inside _LOCATION_ and colocalized with _METHOD_ suggesting a _LOCATION_ localization . due to the high homology of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ cdna sequences primers were carefully designed in specific regions . absence of cross amplification was verified by pcr using plasmids containing _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ as a _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ level was not modulated when plants were treated with zn or cd in hydroponic conditions for a few hours to one week . _PROTEIN_ mrna was detected in all plant parts but at weak levels since at least cycles of pcr were needed . in the same conditions _PROTEIN_ was detected as soon as the cycle . highest levels of _PROTEIN_ mrna were found in old rosette leaves in roots and in cauline leaves .
the wild type saccharomyces cerevisiae strain the cadmium sensitive strain and the zinc sensitive strain were used for _PROTEIN_ heterologous _PROTEIN_ and phenotype characterization . synthetic yeast medium without uracil g l drop out g l was used with additional raffinose for yeast precultures and with galactose and raffinose for induction during metal tolerance experiments on solid medium . alternatively liquid medium inductions were conducted using galactose as unique source of _PROTEIN_ . total rna was extracted from leaves of a. thaliana ecotype according to . _PROTEIN_ full length cdna was amplified through reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction using the omniscript reverse transcriptase and the expand high fidelity taq polymerase . rt was performed using of total rna and an oligo primer . cdna was amplified using the following oligonucleotides _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ designed on the columbia genomic sequence in order to amplify the _PROTEIN_ open reading frame . the complete cdna sequence was subcloned in the pcr xl topo vector and was sequenced using a perkin elmer abi prism sequencer . _PROTEIN_ was then cloned into the not i site of the yeast _PROTEIN_ vector downstream the pgal promoter resulting in plasmid _PROTEIN_ . a green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ plasmid was constructed by introducing the eco ri/ not i fragment from the _METHOD_ vector into the eco ri/ not i sites of . _PROTEIN_ was then cloned in frame with the _METHOD_ gene into the spe i and pst i sites of the _METHOD_ vector resulting in plasmid allowing the yeast _PROTEIN_ of a _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein . the plasmid was generated with the quickchange site directed mutagenesis kit from stratagene using the plasmid _PROTEIN_ as template and the _PROTEIN_ forward and _PROTEIN_ reverse couple of primers _PROTEIN_ . the plasmid codes for a _PROTEIN_ mutant of _PROTEIN_ which is unable to form the aspartyl phosphate intermediate involved in the p type _PROTEIN_ catalytic cycle . another construction was performed in containing a _METHOD_ construction into the sac i/ not i sites allowing the complementation of the strain . yeast strains were transformed using the liac technique using uracil complementation for selection . yeast _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ were stained with according to . yeast cells were observed through confocal microscopy using a krypton/argon laser . excitation for _METHOD_ and was performed at nm and recordings were performed at nm for _METHOD_ and at nm for . yeast inductions were performed at during h with galactose containing medium . cultures were subsequently diluted to optical density and were spotted on solid induction medium supplemented with znso pb or cdcl . incubations were performed up to days at . alternatively induced cultures were diluted to od and grown in liquid medium at aerobically and od was followed at various times over h. generation times were calculated over the early exponential growth phase . pb experiments were not conducted in liquid medium as this metal is hardly soluble in the yeast culture medium . cells were first grown for h in the induction medium described above then for h in ml of cadmium containing induction medium . after centrifugation supernatants were collected cells were washed three times with ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid mm pelleted dried for h at and mineralized . the cadmium content was determined both in the medium and cells using icp _PROTEIN_ . a. thaliana plants were hydroponically grown from h to days with various concentrations of cdcl and znso . the nutritive solution was as follows ca mm _PROTEIN_ mm k hpo kh po mgso mm feso na edta mo o nm mnso znso h bo cuso nm . for tissular mrna distribution plants were grown on sand up to months with a h photoperiod and tissues were collected and stored in liquid nitrogen before rna extraction . total rna were extracted from various plant tissues with trizol . rt was performed using total rna using the reverse first strand cdna synthesis kit . pcrs were performed using extaq polymerase and cycles of for for for s and the primers reported in _PROTEIN_ . actin was used as a control as described in . pcr samples were taken at successive cycles and analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis for quantification checking that amplification did not reach saturation . two independent experiments were conducted and gave similar results .
