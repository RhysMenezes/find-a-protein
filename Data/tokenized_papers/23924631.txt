clathrin mediated endocytosis which depends on the _PROTEIN_ complex plays an essential role in many cellular and developmental processes in mammalian cells . however the function of the _PROTEIN_ complex in plants remains largely unexplored . here we show in arabidopsis that the _PROTEIN_ subunit mutant displays various developmental defects that are similar to those of mutants defective in auxin transport and/or signaling including single trumpet shaped and triple cotyledons impaired vascular pattern reduced vegetative growth defective silique development and drastically reduced fertility . we demonstrate that _PROTEIN_ is closely associated and physically interacts with the clathrin light chain in vivo using _METHOD_ cross correlation spectroscopy protein proximity analyses and co immunoprecipitation assays . using variable angle total internal reflection _METHOD_ microscopy _PROTEIN_ we show that _PROTEIN_ mcherry spots colocalize with clc _METHOD_ at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and that _PROTEIN_ mcherry _METHOD_ appears and disappears before clc _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . the density and turnover rate of the clc _METHOD_ spots are significantly reduced in the mutant . the internalization and recycling of the endocytic tracer and the auxin efflux carrier protein _PROTEIN_ are also significantly reduced in the mutant . further the _PROTEIN_ localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ is significantly disrupted during embryogenesis in the mutant . taken together our results support an essential role of _PROTEIN_ in the assembly of a functional _PROTEIN_ complex in plants which is required for clathrin mediated endocytosis _PROTEIN_ auxin transport and plant growth regulation .
to characterize the function of _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis we first performed phylogenetic analysis using molecular evolutionary genetics analysis . our analysis showed that the arabidopsis genome contains a single gene for _PROTEIN_ which is closely related to animal _PROTEIN_ . in addition _PROTEIN_ is highly conserved across the fungal animal and plant _METHOD_ . sequence alignment analysis further revealed that _PROTEIN_ shares high similarity with human _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . we obtained the _PROTEIN_ heterozygous t dna insertion mutant from the arabidopsis biological resource center _PROTEIN_ and screened for the homozygous line . we could not detect _PROTEIN_ transcripts in the homozygous mutant by rt pcr using primers flanking the t dna insertion site . phenotypic analysis showed that multiple stages of plant growth and developmental processes were disturbed in the mutant . most strikingly the cotyledons exhibited defective organogenesis and of the seedlings had single triple or fused cotyledons . moreover the abnormal cotyledon was also associated with an altered vascular pattern . in the wild type the vascular tissues of the cotyledons formed closed networks . by contrast the cotyledons of the mutant exhibited an open vascular network which was characterized by an increase in free ending veins . when grown in soil the mutant seedlings exhibited dwarf phenotypes with reduced leaf size and stem height . in addition the dwarf seedlings also produced shorter siliques than wild type plants the average silique lengths were mm for the wild type and mm for the mutant . to confirm that the developmental defects in the t dna mutant were caused by the loss of _PROTEIN_ function we transformed an _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ translational fusion construct into the mutant . immunoblot analysis showed that _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ as a fusion protein with _METHOD_ . importantly the transformation of the mutant with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fully rescued the developmental defects . these results indicate that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ is functional and that _PROTEIN_ is required for normal plant growth and development . given the prominent defect in cotyledon formation we investigated embryo development in the mutant . in contrast to the wild type we observed abnormal embryo shapes at the globular stage in the mutant . in the heart and torpedo stages single cotyledon primordium was visible in mutant embryos . moreover the distribution of _METHOD_ was altered in the tip of incipient cotyledons of mutant embryos indicating that the distribution of auxin is disrupted . as the establishment of correct auxin maxima and formation of a normal bilateral axis depend on the _PROTEIN_ localization of the auxin efflux transporter _PROTEIN_ in the embryo we next compared the localization of a functional _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein in the wild type and mutant . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was _PROTEIN_ throughout the wild type embryo with higher _PROTEIN_ in the apical and central region of the globular embryo . at the heart stage _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was restricted to the vascular precursor cells with higher levels at the basal boundary towards the site of the future root tip . the opposite _PROTEIN_ was observed in the protodermal cell layer of cotyledon primordia . in the mutant _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was _PROTEIN_ localized in the region of the cotyledon and vasculature initiation sites at the globular and heart stages but the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was significantly disrupted . the _PROTEIN_ localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was lost accompanied by large aggregations in the _LOCATION_ associated regions . considering that _PROTEIN_ undergoes constitutive clathrin dependent endocytosis and recycling between _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and endosomes we investigated the effects of the mutation on its internalization . to visualize _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ endocytosis we inhibited endocytic recycling using the fungal toxin brefeldin a which causes the heterogeneous aggregation of internalized _PROTEIN_ in intracellular compartments . as expected the aggregation of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in bfa bodies was clearly observed in the wild type when treated with bfa . although bfa treatment also caused the formation of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ aggregates the formation of bfa bodies was remarkably reduced in the mutant . further statistical analysis revealed that the _METHOD_ intensity and size of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ labeled bfa bodies _PROTEIN_ by and respectively in the mutant as compared with the wild type . colocalization and fccs analysis further revealed that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was associated with _PROTEIN_ mcherry . immunoblot analysis demonstrated that there were no differences in _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein levels between the wild type and the mutant ruling this out as having any effect on _PROTEIN_ internalization and localization . these results indicate that _PROTEIN_ is required for the proper internalization of _PROTEIN_ . microarray data show that _PROTEIN_ is ubiquitously _PROTEIN_ in all tissues and throughout all developmental stages and that its _PROTEIN_ level is barely affected by the _PROTEIN_ analyzed in the microarray data . live cell imaging revealed the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ signal as a thin layer at the cell periphery in all cell types analyzed although some _METHOD_ was also observed in the cortical region of the cells . to further examine whether the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ signals are localized to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ periplasmic space or cell wall we performed a plasmolysis experiment with m nacl treatment before confocal imaging . a substantial fraction of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ signal remained associated with the shrunken _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ with little residual signal in the cell walls of the plasmolyzed root epidermal cells . these results indicate that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ is localized both at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and in the cytoplasm . to study how _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ is recruited to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ we examined the dynamics of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in the subapical _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ of growing root hairs using frap . the initial bleaching region was divided into three parts designated as the top middle and bottom sectors . our frap experiment showed that the three regions recovered at equal rates with a similar average half life and percentage recovery suggesting that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ is primarily recruited from the cytoplasm to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . to test whether the _PROTEIN_ complex plays a role in endocytosis in arabidopsis we examined the uptake of the commonly used endocytic tracer in the wild type and mutant . in the wild type labeled _METHOD_ puncta could be detected in the cytoplasm minutes after labeling whereas in the mutant little uptake could be detected even minutes after labeling . to determine the endocytic rate we monitored the internalization of on a long time scale . thirty minutes after labeling the internalization of the dye was obvious in wild type roots by contrast no dye accumulation was apparent in the mutant . one hour after labeling a large number of labeled vesicles were detected in the cytoplasm of wild type cells whereas in the mutant only limited cytoplasmic _METHOD_ was detected even minutes after labeling . the effect of _PROTEIN_ on endocytosis was further confirmed by rescue of the internalization rate in the complementation lines . to gain further insight into the molecular nature of the endocytic defect of the mutant we investigated the colocalization of _PROTEIN_ and clc . we generated transgenic plants co _PROTEIN_ clc _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ mcherry driven by their native promoters . confocal imaging analysis showed a high level of clc _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ mcherry overlap at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ as confirmed by quantitative analysis _PROTEIN_ . fig . is a plot of the cross correlation of clc _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ mcherry as a function of pixel shift . the peak at the center of the surface plot _PROTEIN_ significantly upon shifting the image a few pixels indicating specific colocalization of clc and _PROTEIN_ . the mean _PROTEIN_ values were for the proximity of clc to _PROTEIN_ and for the proximity of _PROTEIN_ to clc . the possible interaction between clc and _PROTEIN_ was then investigated using co immunoprecipitation and fccs . _PROTEIN_ mcherry was co immunoprecipitated with clc _METHOD_ in transgenic plants co _PROTEIN_ the two proteins indicating that _PROTEIN_ interacts with clc in vivo . the interaction between _PROTEIN_ and clc was further analyzed using fccs . for each dataset the amplitude of cross correlation was compared with the green _METHOD_ or red _PROTEIN_ autocorrelation amplitude which represented the percentage of molecules associated with each other . a strong association was indeed observed between clc _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ mcherry in living cells and the cross correlation values were for clc to _PROTEIN_ and for _PROTEIN_ to clc . moreover we found that both tyrphostin an inhibitor of clathrin dependent endocytosis and its inactive analog tyrphostin had no significant effect on the association of the two proteins . we then applied va _PROTEIN_ to analyze the dynamics of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . when transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were viewed under va _PROTEIN_ the fluorophores appeared as small diffraction limited _METHOD_ spots and displayed similar dynamic behavior to clc _METHOD_ including the appearance into and disappearance from the focal plane . interestingly _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ exhibited some unique characteristics . most of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signals were diffraction limited _METHOD_ spots and no large puncta were observed in the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgenic plants whereas the cortical trans _LOCATION_ network could be clearly detected in clc _METHOD_ transgenic plants . we further analyzed the dynamic behavior of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and clc _METHOD_ by measuring their diffusion coefficients and mean velocities . the diffusion coefficients were calculated by performing a linear fit of the mean squared displacement _METHOD_ versus time . interestingly the diffusion coefficients of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and clc _METHOD_ were similar both ranging from to . the values were for _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and for clc _METHOD_ . the two proteins also moved with similar velocities for _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and for clc _METHOD_ . to verify the relationship between _PROTEIN_ and clathrin we investigated the effects of on the dynamics of _PROTEIN_ . when _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgenic arabidopsis seedlings were treated with the number of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ spots at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ was significantly reduced . when the seedlings were treated with this effect was not observed indicating that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ labeled _METHOD_ spots were specifically sensitive to which is similar to its effect on the dynamin related protein _PROTEIN_ during clathrin mediated endocytosis in arabidopsis . given that _PROTEIN_ had a high cross correlation with clc and displayed very similar dynamics to clc _METHOD_ at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ we next examined their dynamics at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ by imaging plants co _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mcherry and clc _METHOD_ using dual color va _PROTEIN_ . in root epidermal cells the clc _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ mcherry fusion proteins appeared as well dispersed diffraction limited _METHOD_ spots at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and the _PROTEIN_ mcherry _METHOD_ spots overlapped with those of clc _METHOD_ . in addition some _METHOD_ spots containing only _METHOD_ or mcherry signal were observed . fig . shows time lapse imaging analysis of a single _METHOD_ spot exhibiting both green and red _METHOD_ . at t seconds the _PROTEIN_ mcherry _METHOD_ appears and increases rapidly and then the clc _METHOD_ _METHOD_ appears at the same site and colocalizes with the red signal . at t seconds the _PROTEIN_ mcherry _METHOD_ has disappeared and only the clc _METHOD_ spot is still visible until it disappears seconds _PROTEIN_ . from the kymograph and a comparison of the _METHOD_ intensity profiles representing the ccp labeled by clc _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ mcherry it is obvious that the _PROTEIN_ mcherry _METHOD_ appeared and disappeared ahead of the clc _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . to provide further insight into the requirement of _PROTEIN_ in clathrin mediated endocytosis we examined the localization and dynamics of clc _METHOD_ in the mutant . immunoblot analysis showed that the clc _METHOD_ protein level in the wild type and mutant were similar . confocal analysis showed that clc _METHOD_ was localized to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ intracellular structures _LOCATION_ and cytoplasm . however the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ associated clc _METHOD_ signal was significantly lower in the mutant than in wild type seedlings . under va _PROTEIN_ clc _METHOD_ in the wild type was distributed in small spots at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and underwent constant internalization . in the mutant clc _METHOD_ spots still formed but the ccp density was significantly lower than in the wild type . because differences in ccp lifetime can affect their density we further measured the turnover rate of ccps . as shown in the kymograph clc _METHOD_ in the wild type was efficiently recruited to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ whereas the turnover rate was greatly reduced in the mutant . the appearance and disappearance rate of clc _METHOD_ in the mutant _PROTEIN_ significantly to of that in the wild type . tem showed that of the cell surface was occupied by ccvs in the wild type whereas ccvs were less abundant in the mutant occupying only of the cell surface .
