clathrin mediated endocytosis is the best characterized type of endocytosis in eukaryotic cells . plants appear to possess all of the molecular components necessary to carry out cme however functional characterization of the components is still in its infancy . a yeast two hybrid screen identified as a putative interaction partner of cellulose _PROTEIN_ . arabidopsis is homologous to the medium subunit of the mammalian _PROTEIN_ protein _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . in mammals the _PROTEIN_ complex acts as the central hub of cme by docking to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ while concomitantly recruiting cargo proteins clathrin triskelia and accessory proteins to the sites of endocytosis . we confirmed that interacts with multiple _PROTEIN_ proteins through the homology domain of which is involved in specific interactions with endocytic cargo proteins in mammals . consistent with its role in mediating the endocytosis of cargos at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ yellow _METHOD_ protein localized to transient foci at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and loss of resulted in defects in bulk endocytosis . furthermore loss of led to increased accumulation of yellow _METHOD_ protein _PROTEIN_ particles at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . our results suggest that _PROTEIN_ represents a new class of cme cargo proteins and that plant cells might regulate cellulose synthesis by controlling the abundance of active _PROTEIN_ complexes at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ through cme .
was identified as a putative interaction partner of the central domain of _PROTEIN_ in a conventional screen . in mammals the n terminal domain of mediates its association with the _PROTEIN_ complex whereas the c terminal homology domain of is involved in specific interactions with endocytic cargo proteins . to investigate the cargo binding role of both full length and were tested for direct interaction with full length _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ using the split ubiquitin assay which can analyze protein protein interactions of integral _LOCATION_ proteins . in the su screen reconstitution of a functional ubiquitin from its n terminal and c terminal halves is recognized by ubiquitin specific proteases which cleave a fused transcription _PROTEIN_ module from the cub to activate the _PROTEIN_ of lexa driven reporter genes and lacz in the _LOCATION_ . wild type nub readily binds to the cub of the _PROTEIN_ cub plv and _PROTEIN_ cub plv bait constructs and was used as a positive control . a mutated form of nub has a reduced affinity for binding to cub and was used as a negative control with the bait constructs . when either or was fused to nubg and cotransformed into yeast with _PROTEIN_ cub plv or _PROTEIN_ cub plv the _PROTEIN_ of reporter genes was detected suggesting that full length and can interact with _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . as an additional negative control no reporter gene _PROTEIN_ was detected when either nubg or nubg was cotransformed with cub plv alone . to validate the interaction between and the primary _PROTEIN_ further in vitro pull down assays were performed . despite numerous attempts we were unable to _PROTEIN_ full length _PROTEIN_ proteins in escherichia coli . therefore the central domains of primary _PROTEIN_ were used in the pull down assays . _PROTEIN_ was able to pull down his _PROTEIN_ his _PROTEIN_ and his _PROTEIN_ . no detectable his _PROTEIN_ proteins were pulled down by purified glutathione s transferase _PROTEIN_ . these data suggest that mediates the interaction between and the central domain of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . to investigate the role of in arabidopsis two available transfer dna insertion lines for were obtained from the arabidopsis biological resource center . the line contained a t dna insertion at the splice site between the fourth exon and the fourth intron and the line contained a t dna insertion in the seventh exon . homozygous and mutants lacked detectable transcripts as analyzed by reverse transcription pcr and therefore were concluded to be null alleles . and shared similar phenotypes therefore only was used for functional analysis of . scanning electron microscopy of pollen grains showed irregular or collapsed cell wall morphologies similar to the phenotypes reported for null mutants of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . compared with wild type seedlings seedlings had longer primary roots and etiolated hypocotyls . in to d old light grown seedlings roots were approximately longer than those of wild type seedlings . likewise in to d old dark grown seedlings hypocotyls were to longer than those of wild type seedlings . in contrast adult plants were smaller in stature than wild type plants and siliques of plants were shorter and thinner than wild type siliques . the widespread mutant phenotypes of suggest that plays a role in many tissues which is consistent with the ubiquitous _PROTEIN_ of obtained from genevestigator . to obtain a detailed _PROTEIN_ profile of the kb region upstream of was fused to the gus gene and transformed into wild type plants . a histochemical analysis of gus activity was performed in the transgenic plants . gus _PROTEIN_ from gus was detected in dark grown hypocotyls rosette leaves stamen pollen developing siliques and roots . the internalization of a _LOCATION_ impermeable _METHOD_ styryl dye is commonly used to visualize general endocytosis in plant cells . it has been shown previously that small bright intracellular puncta with tgn/ee localization are visible after short exposure of root cells to and that uptake of can be quantified under these conditions . therefore the general endocytic efficiency of and wild type seedlings was quantified in root epidermal cells after a short exposure to . wild type seedlings showed many bright intracellular puncta while seedlings showed fewer intracellular puncta that were of lower intensity . quantification of the internalization of revealed that cells exhibited an approximately _PROTEIN_ in internalization compared with the wild type supporting the role of in general endocytosis in arabidopsis . to examine the subcellular localization of a _METHOD_ _METHOD_ construct containing an approximately kb native promoter genomic sequence and a c terminal _METHOD_ tag was transformed into plants . _METHOD_ fully complemented the internalization defect of the mutant and the mutant phenotype of dark grown hypocotyls suggesting that the _METHOD_ fusion protein was functional . in dark grown hypocotyls _METHOD_ localized to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ with punctate distribution and exhibited temporal behavior of appearance and disappearance . the distribution and temporal behavior of _METHOD_ was similar to what has been observed for clc and dynamin related proteins suggesting that _METHOD_ might have a role in cme . to test the involvement of in cme the _METHOD_ line was crossed with a clc morange line . in dark grown hypocotyls both _METHOD_ and clc morange localized to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ with punctate distribution and extensive colocalization . colocalization ratios between _METHOD_ and clc morange were significantly higher than what is expected by coincident colocalization between randomly distributed particle populations of the same density . both _METHOD_ and clc morange particles exhibited transient behavior such that particles appeared and disappeared at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ while exhibiting minimal _PROTEIN_ movement . by documenting the temporal behavior of colocalized particles it was observed that _METHOD_ and clc morange particles appeared and disappeared either within the same frame or within s of one another . the mean lifetimes of _METHOD_ and clc morange particles at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ showed some variation with average lifetimes of and s respectively . the localization and temporal behavior of _METHOD_ and clc morange in dark grown hypocotyls are similar to those of clc and dynamin related proteins _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in other cell types that have been observed in previous studies which provides support for playing a role in cme . a cross between mcherry _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ lines was performed in order to observe the relationship between _PROTEIN_ and in planta . like other _METHOD_ protein _PROTEIN_ fusions _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ localized mcherry _PROTEIN_ formed small puncta that traveled bidirectionally at constant velocities in linear trajectories . _METHOD_ and mcherry _PROTEIN_ particles both localized to distinct foci at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . although a small subset of _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ localized _METHOD_ and mcherry _PROTEIN_ particles were colocalized the colocalization ratio between the two particle populations was not significantly different from what is expected by coincident overlap of randomly distributed particles . this observation is consistent with the transient and infrequent nature that would be expected of _PROTEIN_ endocytosis . to investigate whether _METHOD_ and mcherry _PROTEIN_ particles were functionally associated with one another we observed the temporal behavior of colocalized particles . in some cases the transient formation and disappearance of _METHOD_ particles was synchronized with a corresponding disappearance or depletion of mcherry _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . these events suggest that _METHOD_ and mcherry _PROTEIN_ are functionally associated at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ where _PROTEIN_ can be endocytosed through a mediated mechanism . interestingly _METHOD_ also localized to intracellular compartments that exhibited cytoplasmic streaming behavior and overlapped with mcherry _PROTEIN_ labeled compartments . mammalian is believed to be exclusively involved in endocytosis at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ while other homologs mediate trafficking at intracellular compartments . the localization of _METHOD_ to intracellular compartments in arabidopsis may represent a plant specific role of . if mediates the internalization of _PROTEIN_ the endocytosis defect of would be expected to affect the distribution of _PROTEIN_ at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . to investigate the distribution of _PROTEIN_ a line _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ which complements the _PROTEIN_ mutation was crossed with . the consequent _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ line with a homozygous and _PROTEIN_ background was compared with a _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ control line that was homozygous for _PROTEIN_ . to prevent interference from intracellular _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ while analyzing the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ localized _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ population only regions of interest that were devoid of underlying intracellular _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ signal were analyzed . to aid in identifying rois that lacked intracellular _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ an image was obtained from the focal plane just beneath the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ immediately after the acquisition of each _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ localized _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ image . the distribution of grayscale values from _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ rois showed greater _METHOD_ intensity than rois in _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ seedlings . in addition the mean grayscale value of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in rois was significantly higher in the _PROTEIN_ background compared with the _PROTEIN_ control . the particle density of _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ localized _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was measured by dividing the number of local foci maxima detected in each roi by the area of the roi . particle density in the _PROTEIN_ background was particles compared with particles in the _PROTEIN_ background . these observations show that mutant seedlings have more _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ which may result from the endocytosis defect of . the increased number of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ particles at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ in the _PROTEIN_ background could result from reduced endocytosis of _PROTEIN_ increased delivery of _PROTEIN_ or both . the delivery rate of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ seedlings was measured by quantifying the delivery of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ particles within a photobleached roi during a min period after photobleaching . as intracellular _PROTEIN_ compartments streamed through the roi _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ localized _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ particles reappeared within the bleached area . similar to previous studies these _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ localized particles often exhibited a period of stationary behavior before moving at constant velocities . only newly delivered particles and not _PROTEIN_ mobile particles from the perimeter of the bleached roi were quantified . the delivery rate of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ particles was similar in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ backgrounds . these delivery rates were comparable to previous studies . these data show that does not affect the rate of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ delivery to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . therefore the elevated density of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ particles in the _PROTEIN_ background likely results from a reduction in the endocytosis of _PROTEIN_ due to a lack of function . to investigate whether the increased density of _PROTEIN_ at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ in influenced the behavior of _PROTEIN_ the motility of _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ localized _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ particles was measured in both the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ genetic backgrounds . in both lines _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ particles traveled bidirectionally at constant velocities along linear tracks that can be visualized in averaged projections of min time lapse images . in spite of the increased _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ particle density in the _PROTEIN_ background the velocity distribution for _PROTEIN_ particles was similar in both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ genetic backgrounds with average velocities of nm in _PROTEIN_ and nm in _PROTEIN_ . this observation suggests that although the distribution of _PROTEIN_ is affected by the function of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ may not be significantly affected by .
