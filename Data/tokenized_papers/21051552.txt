proteins that are synthesized on cytoplasmic ribosomes but function within _LOCATION_ must be imported and then targeted to one of six _LOCATION_ locations . although multiple _METHOD_ that target proteins to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ or _LOCATION_ lumen have been identified a system that can direct the integration of inner envelope _LOCATION_ proteins from the stroma has not been previously described . genetics and localization studies were used to show that _LOCATION_ contain two different sec _METHOD_ with distinct functions . loss of function mutations in components of the previously described _LOCATION_ localized sec system designated as _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis result in albino seedlings and sucrose dependent heterotrophic growth . loss of function mutations in components of the second sec system designated as _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis result in arrest at the globular stage and embryo lethality . promoter swap experiments provided evidence that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are functionally nonredundant and perform different roles in the cell . finally chloroplast import and fractionation assays and immunogold localization of _PROTEIN_ green _METHOD_ protein fusion proteins in root tissues indicated that _PROTEIN_ is part of an envelope localized sec system . our data suggest that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ function in sec mediated integration and translocation processes at the inner envelope _LOCATION_ .
a line showing recessive embryo lethality was identified within a collection of approximately lines generated following agrobacterium tumefaciens mediated transformation of wild type plants . shriveled seed was observed in the seed stock and kanamycin resistance associated with the inserted t dna segregated at a ratio of approximately . when _PROTEIN_ stage siliques from heterozygous parents were opened small brown seeds that appeared to be empty as shown in figure were observed at a frequency of . earlier stage siliques were opened and cleared and the embryos inside the seeds were examined . in siliques that contained mostly _PROTEIN_ heart stage embryos approximately of the seeds contained embryos arrested at the globular stage of embryogenesis with extra cell divisions apparent in the suspensor . based on the frequency embryo lethality appeared to be recessive rather than dominant and likely due to disruption of an essential gene . the line was backcrossed to the wild type two times and cosegregation analysis of a population of over individuals indicated that the embryo lethal trait was tightly linked to the t dna insertion and kanamycin resistance . sequencing of the flanking dna revealed that the t dna had inserted into the seventh intron of _GENE_ as shown in figure . a deletion of bp occurred at the insertion site but the gene was otherwise intact . a clone of _GENE_ genomic sequence was introduced by transformation . the genomic clone complemented the mutant phenotype as evidenced by the identification of individuals that were homozygous for the original t dna insertion in _GENE_ in the generation . three additional alleles in the columbia background were reported in a large scale project to identify essential genes in arabidopsis . the _GENE_ locus corresponds to a gene previously identified as _PROTEIN_ . a cdna sequence corresponding to the _GENE_ transcript was amplified from light grown shoots and the predicted amino acid sequence was used to perform blast searches . the databases contain many related sequences from other plants and algae as well as cyanobacteria and other bacteria . the most similar is a predicted protein from vitis vinifera which is identical to the predicted mature protein . a secy sequence from chlamydomonas reinhardtii is identical and a synechococcus secy sequence is identical . protein hydrophobicity plots indicated that the arabidopsis protein is likely to have transmembrane domains and a topology that is similar to that of secy from escherichia coli . the most closely related arabidopsis protein which is only identical but has a similar predicted protein topology is cpsecy a subunit of a _LOCATION_ localized preprotein translocase . based on the sequence relationships we renamed the _PROTEIN_ locus as _PROTEIN_ and designated the ws allele as _PROTEIN_ . _GENE_ was designated as the _PROTEIN_ locus . in accordance with nomenclature guidelines for arabidopsis genes we will refer to the proteins encoded by these loci as _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . an analysis of the predicted amino acid sequence using targetp indicated that the n terminus of _PROTEIN_ is likely to encode a _LOCATION_ transit peptide . in order to determine whether _PROTEIN_ is capable of localizing to _LOCATION_ in vitro translated radiolabeled precursor to arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ was incubated with isolated pea chloroplasts in an in vitro import assay . was imported into the chloroplasts processed to a mature kd size and localized to _LOCATION_ . immunoblots with antibodies to the inner _LOCATION_ protein _PROTEIN_ and the _LOCATION_ protein cptatc indicated that the _LOCATION_ fraction contained both the envelope and the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . _PROTEIN_ extracted _LOCATION_ retained _PROTEIN_ indicating that _PROTEIN_ is integrated into the _LOCATION_ . the mature _PROTEIN_ protein in whole chloroplasts appears to migrate as a smaller protein than that associated with the _LOCATION_ . however this is likely to be the result of the highly abundant rubisco large subunit present in chloroplasts that distorts the migration of other proteins in this region of the gel resulting in a concave moon band shape . protease treatment of _LOCATION_ produced two degradation products that measured and kd in size . degradation products are expected from protease treatment of _LOCATION_ integrated proteins that possess both exposed and _LOCATION_ protected regions . together these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ is a _LOCATION_ integrated _LOCATION_ protein . to confirm that _PROTEIN_ is _LOCATION_ localized a construct encoding a _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ translational fusion was generated and introduced into arabidopsis plants . the construct included bp of sequence upstream of the _PROTEIN_ and the complete _PROTEIN_ coding sequence minus the last codon and stop codon . this was introduced into _PROTEIN_ plants and the generation was screened for plants that were homozygous for _PROTEIN_ . several individuals were identified indicating that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ complements the _PROTEIN_ mutation . based on this we suggest that the distribution of the _METHOD_ signal is likely to represent the distribution of functional _PROTEIN_ . _METHOD_ signal although rather weak could be readily detected in tissues with nongreen _LOCATION_ such as the root tip root hairs and dark grown hypocotyls . in the root tips _METHOD_ signal was associated with organelles of diverse size and shape . these correspond to the different types of _LOCATION_ that have been previously described in roots including statoliths in the columella cells of root cap and other types of amyloplasts . in the amyloplasts where the center is occupied by one or more large starch grains the _METHOD_ signal appeared as a _PROTEIN_ or halo indicating that the signal was confined to the periphery of these organelles . this was less obvious in _LOCATION_ in regions more distal to the tip which tended to have elongated profiles and appeared to be interconnected forming a network throughout the cells . stromules which are thin envelope bound extensions of stroma were also visible suggesting that the _METHOD_ signal was associated with the envelope _LOCATION_ . unfortunately we could not extend the in vivo observations to tissues with green _LOCATION_ because the intense _METHOD_ of chlorophyll masked the weaker signal from the _METHOD_ fusion protein . microarray analyses indicate that _PROTEIN_ is constitutively _PROTEIN_ at a low level in most arabidopsis tissues _METHOD_ . this combined with the in vitro localization results with chloroplasts suggests that _PROTEIN_ localizes to a variety of _LOCATION_ types including chloroplasts . the embryo lethal phenotype associated with _PROTEIN_ mutations indicated that _PROTEIN_ is an essential protein yet the arabidopsis genome contains another locus _PROTEIN_ that encodes a _LOCATION_ localized secy homolog . to investigate the relationship between the functions of the gene products encoded by _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutants were isolated and characterized . two potential loss of function t dna alleles were identified in the ws background . as shown in figure _PROTEIN_ has a t dna insert in the first intron and _PROTEIN_ has a t dna insert in the third exon . analysis of phenotypic changes in the _PROTEIN_ mutants indicated that _PROTEIN_ is also an essential gene . when seeds from a heterozygous parent were sown on suc containing medium small pale seedlings appeared at a frequency of for the _PROTEIN_ line and for the _PROTEIN_ line . the pale seedlings were identified as homozygous scy and _PROTEIN_ plants through pcr based genotyping . in addition when maturing siliques were opened and of the seeds were pale for the _PROTEIN_ line and the _PROTEIN_ line respectively . because arabidopsis seeds reflect the color of the embryos inside them this suggests that _PROTEIN_ is required for normal greening during embryogenesis . assembly of chlorophyll protein complexes does not appear to be essential for embryo viability because most of the pale embryos completed germination and survived to the seedling stage . they remained approximately the same size as their green siblings until d after germination . by d after germination their smaller size became apparent . wild type seedlings produced true leaves by day after germination while the pale seedlings initially showed no signs of apical growth . however if the pale seedlings were cultured for extended periods in the presence of suc they grew slowly and produced _PROTEIN_ organs in a spiral _PROTEIN_ . unlike normal leaves these were translucent and yellow in color . the plants eventually formed pale floral buds but were infertile at least when grown on plates . no full length _PROTEIN_ transcripts could be detected in the pale seedlings by reverse transcription pcr indicating that the phenotypic changes in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ reflect complete loss of function of _PROTEIN_ . disruptions in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ genes exhibit mutant phenotypes at different developmental stages . to examine whether differences in _PROTEIN_ rather than differences in function are the basis of genetic nonredundancy we performed a promoter swap experiment . primers used in these experiments for genotyping _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ alleles in the presence of various transgenes are listed in supplemental table and a summary of the results is presented in figure . first we determined that the _PROTEIN_ genomic sequence that included bp of _PROTEIN_ upstream sequence _PROTEIN_ was sufficient to rescue _PROTEIN_ mutations . three lines showing full complementation of the seedling arrest mutant phenotype were recovered . for each line plants that carried the _PROTEIN_ transgene and were homozygous for _PROTEIN_ were identified in the generation and their genotype was confirmed in the generation . although a few pale plants were observed in the population most of the plants were indistinguishable from the wild type as shown in supplemental figure . second we determined that the _PROTEIN_ genomic sequence that included bp of _PROTEIN_ upstream sequence _PROTEIN_ was sufficient to rescue _PROTEIN_ mutations . five lines showing full complementation of the embryo lethal trait were recovered . plants that carry the _PROTEIN_ transgene and are homozygous for _PROTEIN_ were indistinguishable from the wild type as shown in supplemental figure . the siliques of individual plants showed either no embryo lethality or up to embryo lethality which likely reflects the dosage and segregation of the transgene . surviving plants in the following generation were all homozygous for _PROTEIN_ . third we generated two promoter swap constructs _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . these were introduced into genetic backgrounds that contained either _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ alleles . four lines of _PROTEIN_ homozygous plants carrying the _PROTEIN_ construct were recovered . some of the plants were indistinguishable from the wild type but most were lighter green possibly because the _PROTEIN_ promoter is not as strong as the _PROTEIN_ promoter in shoot tissues . five lines of _PROTEIN_ homozygous plants carrying the _PROTEIN_ construct were recovered . these plants were visually indistinguishable from the wild type as shown in supplemental figure . in contrast when the _PROTEIN_ construct was introduced into backgrounds with _PROTEIN_ mutations no homozygous individuals were identified in the generation of six independent lines . similarly when the _PROTEIN_ construct was introduced into backgrounds with _PROTEIN_ mutations only heterozygous individuals were viable in the generation of five independent lines . based on these results we conclude that the coding sequence rather than the upstream regulatory regions is the primary determinant of the ability to complement . this indicates that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ proteins can not substitute for each other but rather play different essential roles in plant cells . _PROTEIN_ has previously been localized to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . given that _PROTEIN_ is required prior to _LOCATION_ development in embryos and accumulates in nongreen _LOCATION_ after germination we considered the possibility that _PROTEIN_ localizes to a different _LOCATION_ possibly the _LOCATION_ envelope . in vitro import assays were performed with pea chloroplasts followed by _LOCATION_ fractionation . _PROTEIN_ distribution was compared with that of a radiolabeled inner envelope phosphate translocator the precursor of which was coimported with . processed _METHOD_ of both proteins can be detected in both the envelope and _LOCATION_ fractions . fractionation quality was judged by the relative amounts of envelope and _LOCATION_ marker proteins _PROTEIN_ that could be found in each respective fraction by immunoblotting . the envelope fraction is free of _LOCATION_ contamination because cptatc was only found in the _LOCATION_ fraction . however fractionation was not complete because a small amount of _PROTEIN_ was found in the _LOCATION_ fraction . imported radiolabeled was also found in the _LOCATION_ fraction further indicating that the _LOCATION_ fraction was partly contaminated with envelope _LOCATION_ . envelope _LOCATION_ contamination of _LOCATION_ is common especially when fractionation is conducted on chloroplasts recovered from protein import assays . therefore in order to eliminate envelope vesicles from the _LOCATION_ fraction _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ recovered from a _PROTEIN_ import assay were sequentially washed by pelleting through a percoll cushion as described by citation . even after all detectable _PROTEIN_ was washed from the _LOCATION_ fraction a small but significant amount of _PROTEIN_ remained . these experiments suggest that imported _PROTEIN_ localizes predominantly although perhaps not exclusively to envelope _LOCATION_ . to examine _PROTEIN_ distribution in vivo root tips from one line of seedlings used for _METHOD_ imaging were subjected to high pressure freezing freeze substitution and immunogold labeling with antibodies to _METHOD_ . gold particles were preferentially associated with the _LOCATION_ in the root cells of plants _PROTEIN_ the _METHOD_ fusion protein . few gold particles were observed in association with other components of the cytoplasm or with the _LOCATION_ of wild type plants . labeling of _LOCATION_ was also not seen in controls where the secondary antibody was used alone . this indicates that the labeling is specific and _METHOD_ our identification of the _METHOD_ labeled organelles viewed by confocal microscopy as _LOCATION_ . as figure c and d show the gold particles are found predominantly at the periphery of the _LOCATION_ . given the dimensions of antibody molecules any gold particles within nm of the periphery can reflect envelope localization . some of the gold particles were more distantly and centrally located but these are less frequently observed . we conclude that in the _LOCATION_ of roots in cells where _PROTEIN_ is normally _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is associated primarily with the envelope _LOCATION_ . if _PROTEIN_ functions as the translocon for a canonical sec system it should work in concert with a seca protein the _PROTEIN_ that threads the polypeptide through the secy channel . the arabidopsis genome contains two loci that encode seca proteins _GENE_ and _GENE_ . we initiated a study of the functions of these proteins by identifying t dna mutant alleles in the salk collection and performing a phenotypic screen . we identified one allele of _GENE_ that is a candidate loss of function allele . the t dna inserted in the fifth exon in this line . an analysis of this allele and the phenotype of albino or glassy _PROTEIN_ mutant plants carrying a second allele was recently published . the essential parts of our analysis which confirm their observations are presented here . when siliques developing on plants heterozygous for the salk allele were opened pale seeds were observed at a frequency of . when seeds from these parents were sown on plates containing suc of the seedlings were also pale . pcr genotyping showed that these are homozygous for the mutation and they also fail to produce full length transcripts as shown by rt pcr . like _PROTEIN_ mutants when grown for extended periods on suc the pale seedlings produce yellow and translucent _PROTEIN_ organs as reported previously . seca proteins usually partition between soluble and peripheral _LOCATION_ phases with _LOCATION_ association due to specific interaction with secy . the similarity in the mutant phenotypes is consistent with the hypothesis that this protein functions with _PROTEIN_ . therefore we refer to the product of the _GENE_ _PROTEIN_ locus by the registered gene product symbol _PROTEIN_ and designate the salk t dna allele as _PROTEIN_ . we identified one allele of _GENE_ as a potential loss of function allele . the t dna inserted into the exon in this line . a total of of the seeds in the siliques of heterozygous parents abort and analysis of cleared siliques indicated that the embryos arrest at the globular stage of development . a cosegregation analysis performed after five backcrosses to columbia wild type showed that the embryo lethal trait is closely linked to the insertion . eighteen plants in the population were heterozygous for the mutant allele and only these plants produced siliques with aborted embryos . we subsequently identified a second potential loss of function allele with a t dna insertion in the first exon in the versailles collection _PROTEIN_ . heterozygous plants carrying this t dna insertion also produced seeds with embryos arrested at the globular stage and the embryo lethal trait also cosegregated with the t dna . based on the similarity to the mutant phenotype of _PROTEIN_ we have designated the _GENE_ locus as _PROTEIN_ and the t dna alleles as _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . although many genes when mutated produce embryo lethal phenotypes the _PROTEIN_ that both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutations produce arrested globular stage embryos is consistent with the hypothesis that _PROTEIN_ functions with _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ has not been characterized previously . we confirmed that it is likely to be directed to _LOCATION_ through an import assay . a full length cdna clone was isolated and sequenced and subsequently used for in vitro transcription and translation . the sequence of this clone included extra nucleotides in exon relative to accession suggesting that alternative splicing of the transcript may occur . the predicted protein is only identical to _PROTEIN_ at the amino acid level but contains all of the signature domains for seca proteins . in vitro coupled transcription and translation produced the predicted precursor to arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ at kd . when incubated with isolated pea chloroplasts the precursor was processed to a mature size of kd and localized to the stroma . in vitro translation also produced several smaller translation products . in vitro translation of very large polypeptides frequently yields _PROTEIN_ truncated proteins due to premature termination . this appears to be the case for _PROTEIN_ as two smaller processed proteins were also recovered with chloroplasts and localized to the stroma . secy proteins have been shown to physically interact with sece proteins to form the _LOCATION_ associated portion of the translocon . only one _LOCATION_ localized sece homolog encoded by _GENE_ has been reported thus far in arabidopsis . we identified one potential loss of function allele in the versailles collection of t dna mutants . in the _PROTEIN_ line the t dna inserted into the single exon that constitutes the coding region disrupting the sece domain . when siliques of plants heterozygous for this mutation were opened they were found to contain pale seeds at a frequency of . when seeds from these parents were sown of the seedlings were pale as shown in figure and these were homozygous for the mutation as confirmed by pcr genotyping . rt pcr analysis indicated that sece transcripts fail to accumulate in the pale seedlings . as with the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants the pale seedlings produce translucent and yellow leaf like _PROTEIN_ organs and floral buds with extended culture in the presence of suc . a cosegregation analysis performed after one backcross to the ws wild type showed that the production of white seeds is closely linked to the insertion . fifty seven plants in the population were heterozygous for the mutant allele and only these plants produced siliques that contained approximately white seeds . genomic sequence corresponding to the _GENE_ locus was introduced into heterozygous plants by transformation . individuals that contained the introduced sequence and were homozygous for the original t dna insertion in _GENE_ were identified by pcr genotyping in the generation . these individuals were viable and green therefore we conclude that the disruption of _GENE_ was responsible for the albino phenotype . the similarity of the mutant phenotype to the phenotype of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants is consistent with the hypothesis that the gene product functions in complexes with _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . consequently we have designated the _GENE_ locus as _PROTEIN_ and the t dna allele as _PROTEIN_ .
the _PROTEIN_ allele was isolated following the transformation of arabidopsis wild type plants with a construct consisting of the cauliflower mosaic virus promoter fused to _PROTEIN_ antisense sequence . dna flanking the insertion was amplified from kanamycin resistant plants through tail pcr . plants carrying _PROTEIN_ mutant alleles were identified by screening the t dna populations at

all of the constructs were transferred into a modified transformation vector containing the nos terminator . the _PROTEIN_ construct consisted of bp of sequence upstream of _PROTEIN_ the full coding sequence of _PROTEIN_ with all of the introns and a c terminal extension encoding a epitope tag . for the _PROTEIN_ construct _PROTEIN_ genomic sequence was amplified using an oligonucleotide that would introduce an ecori site after the _PROTEIN_ . this was inserted behind the _PROTEIN_ upstream sequence using the ecori site in that position in _PROTEIN_ . the rest of the construct included the full coding sequence of _PROTEIN_ with all of the introns and a c terminal extension encoding a epitope tag . to generate the _PROTEIN_ construct _PROTEIN_ upstream sequence was removed from the _PROTEIN_ construct and replaced with bp of _PROTEIN_ upstream sequence amplified using an oligonucleotide that would add an ecori site in the appropriate position after the _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ construct included kb of _PROTEIN_ genomic sequence _PROTEIN_ fused in frame with _METHOD_ . the _PROTEIN_ construct for mutant complementation consisted of a kb bamhi fragment that included

were viewed using a c apochromat water immersion objective . for detecting _METHOD_ an excitation wavelength of nm was used and emission was collected with bandpass to ir . images were also gathered

. root tips were collected from transgenic and wild type d old seedlings and processed as described by citation . samples were subjected to high pressure freezing and freeze substitution at in uranyl acetate glutaraldehyde in acetone . after d the samples were warmed to and infiltrated gradually with lowicryl resin over to d. finally the samples were polymerized at low temperature with uv light . thin sections were mounted on formvar coated nickel grids and incubated in nonfat milk in phosphate buffered saline _PROTEIN_ with tween for min at room temperature prior to incubation for h in either or dilutions of anti _METHOD_ rabbit polyclonal antibodies in the _PROTEIN_ tween buffer . sections were then rinsed for s with _PROTEIN_ with tween and incubated for h in a dilution of goat anti rabbit antibodies conjugated with nm gold or nm gold . after a final s rinse in _PROTEIN_ with tween and a rinse with deionized water specimens were observed using a transmission electron microscope . controls included incubations of wild type tissues with the same antibodies and incubations where the primary antibodies were omitted . a dna fragment encoding the precursor to _PROTEIN_ was amplified using pfu turbo dna polymerase and gene specific primers flanked by restriction sites from cdna generated from light grown shoot rna . the oligonucleotide _PROTEIN_ which added a bamhi site before the _PROTEIN_ was used in combination with _PROTEIN_ which added a kpni site bp after the stop codon . the resulting fragment was cloned into pgem t for sequence analysis . it was excised and subcloned into for in vitro transcription and translation . dna fragments encoding two overlapping halves of the precursor to _PROTEIN_ were amplified from arabidopsis cdna generated from d old columbia seedling rna . the first half was amplified using accccattctttcagcagttc and aacccgggaaatgggttctgtttctaatcttgtga which introduced a smai site upstream of the _PROTEIN_ . the second half was amplified using caggctgtggaggctaaaga and _PROTEIN_ which introduced a kpni site downstream of the stop codon . the two fragments were cloned into pgem t and clones with the same orientation were subsequently fused together using an internal sali site . for import assays the full length cdna sequence was reamplified using _PROTEIN_ which changed the smai site to a kpni site and _PROTEIN_ cloned into pgem t and then subcloned as a kpni kpni fragment behind the promoter in pgem . orientation was confirmed by restriction digests and sequencing . in vitro translated precursor proteins were produced by
