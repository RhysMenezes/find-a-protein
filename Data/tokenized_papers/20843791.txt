_LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ compartmentalization spatiotemporally regulates cell autonomous immune signaling in animal cells . to elucidate immediate early protein dynamics at the plant _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ in response to the bacterial pathogen associated molecular pattern _PROTEIN_ flagellin we employed quantitative _METHOD_ spectrometric analysis on detergent resistant _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ of arabidopsis thaliana suspension cells . this approach revealed rapid and profound changes in drm protein composition following _PROTEIN_ treatment prominently affecting proton _PROTEIN_ and receptor like kinases including the flagellin receptor _PROTEIN_ . we employed reverse genetics to address a potential contribution of a subset of these proteins in triggered cellular responses . mutants of three candidates _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ exhibited a conspicuous defect in the _PROTEIN_ triggered accumulation of reactive oxygen species . in addition these mutants showed altered mitogen activated protein kinase activation a defect in _PROTEIN_ triggered stomatal closure as well as altered bacterial infection phenotypes which revealed three novel players in elicitor dependent oxidative burst control and innate immunity . our data provide evidence for dynamic elicitor induced changes in the _LOCATION_ compartmentalization of _PROTEIN_ signaling components .
to elucidate rapid dynamic changes in pm compartmentalization after elicitation we performed quantitative _METHOD_ spectrometric analyses on pm derived cell culture _METHOD_ in a time course experiment . to allow ratiometric quantification of protein levels we employed full metabolic labeling . since ligand induced endocytosis of _PROTEIN_ takes place as early as min after elicitation _PROTEIN_ induced _LOCATION_ compartmentalization is expected to occur within or even prior to this time frame . changes in protein abundance due to de novo protein biosynthesis can be largely excluded at these early time points . we induced cell cultures with or control treatment and collected samples after and min . we previously verified responsiveness of the cell culture to in an oxidative burst assay . in one experimental setup differentially labeled pairs of cell cultures were either induced with or the antagonistic derivative . an additional paired sample set with the identical treatment but reciprocal labeling was included . in a second setup and treatments were each compared with untreated cells again using two pairs of cell cultures with reciprocal labeling . in experiments pm fractions of pooled or labeled treatment and control samples were extracted by two phase partitioning and subsequently _METHOD_ were isolated by triton x treatment and sucrose gradient centrifugation . after liquid chromatography coupled to _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ analysis proteins were identified based on the fragmentation patterns of peptides using automated data base matching _METHOD_ and ratiometrically quantified . with this workflow we efficiently filtered out the between sample variation and at the same time were able to detect subtle stimulus induced differences in protein abundance . based on the procedure outlined above we identified unique proteins . these overlapped extensively with the reported inventory of drm associated plant proteins . of the proteins were present in reciprocal sample pairs and thus met our criteria for quantitative analysis . _METHOD_ of _PROTEIN_ transformed ratios matched gaussian fits for each tested treatment and time point indicative of normal distribution of the data sets . of the proteins suitable for quantification were significantly enriched in _METHOD_ after treatment in a least one reciprocal sample pair . unaltered abundance of the majority of the drm proteins suggests that the _PROTEIN_ induced shift in drm protein abundance is specific and not an artifact caused by a change in phase partitioning behavior after elicitation . based on prediction by the _PROTEIN_ data base the majority of the proteins found in the drm fraction possess at least one transmembrane domain a glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor or a lipid modification . importantly only of the proteins responded in a statistically significant manner in the control samples . we thus conclude that we successfully identified proteins that specifically respond to exposition . an independent experiment with two replicates using unlabeled cell cultures and quantifying protein abundance based on ion intensities at and min after or treatment corroborated enrichment of the majority of the proteins identified in the reciprocal label experiments . proteins for which quantification was pursued were classified into mapman categories . the apparently large change in the category of protein synthesis reflects the successful exclusion of copurifying contaminants from the significantly responding group . the largest absolute change occurred in the category of transporters . while comprising among the non responding proteins they accounted for of the group of significantly responding proteins . remarkably _PROTEIN_ including the flagellin receptor _PROTEIN_ are significantly enriched in _METHOD_ upon treatment . in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ which undergoes complex formation and endocytosis upon ligand binding is one of the proteins most consistently enriched in _METHOD_ after elicitation in our quantitative proteome analysis . we exemplarily corroborated substantial triggered enrichment of _PROTEIN_ in _METHOD_ by an independent immunoblot experiment . this also revealed depletion of _PROTEIN_ from detergent soluble _LOCATION_ fractions demonstrating the relocalization within the pm . the importance of this pattern recognition receptor in innate immunity is illustrated by the enhanced susceptibility of _PROTEIN_ mutant plants to the bacterial pathogen pseudomonas syringae . furthermore _PROTEIN_ mutants lack the induced oxidative burst callose deposition and stomatal closure . quantitative proteomic analysis revealed a trend toward depletion of four additional responding proteins and unaltered abundance of several non responding proteins in the dsm fractions . together these results strengthen the notion that the observed abundance of the responding proteins in the drm fractions is the consequence of a dynamic process associated with the concomitant depletion of these proteins from the dsm fractions rather than a change in the overall pm abundance of these proteins . however further extensive immunoblot analysis would be required to unequivocally rule out the latter possibility . to test whether any of the proteins identified in our proteomic analysis play a role in induced responses we employed reverse genetics and performed in planta pharmacological interference experiments . we used the occurrence of an oxidative burst mapk activity stomatal closure and the formation of callose deposits as early and _PROTEIN_ markers of responsiveness . mutant lines for out of the genes encoding proteins enriched in _METHOD_ after elicitation were selected and screened for the generation of induced _LOCATION_ ros . most of the tested lines retained unaltered or weakly reduced responsiveness to . mutants in genes _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ showed either a significantly reduced _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or enhanced accumulation of ros . immunoblot analysis revealed that these phenotypes are not the consequence of altered _PROTEIN_ protein levels . _PROTEIN_ codes for a _PROTEIN_ implicated in the female control of pollen tube reception _PROTEIN_ is a constitutively active mutant of the pm h _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ encodes a subunit of the _LOCATION_ h _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . all three mutant lines _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ exhibit defects in vegetative development at the adult stage that were however less pronounced at the juvenile growth stage used for the majority of our physiological assays . pharmacological interference with v _PROTEIN_ function by treatment of wild type plants with concanamycin a a specific inhibitor of v _PROTEIN_ phenocopied the effect of the _PROTEIN_ mutant and resulted in strongly reduced generation of ros . a transgenic complementation line _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ in a homozygous fer background _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ restored the aberrant _PROTEIN_ induced oxidative burst of this mutant . these findings suggest that the observed alterations in triggered ros production are genuine effects of the _PROTEIN_ and fer mutations and not due to second site mutations in these lines . all three mutants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ revealed enhanced induced activation of mapks further substantiating the notion that responsiveness is perturbed in these lines . despite aberrant induced oxidative burst and mapk activation triggered callose deposition was indistinguishable from wild type in rosette leaves of the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants . for comparison we included the _PROTEIN_ mutant . notably although this mutant is fully devoid of any triggered oxidative burst response mapk activation and callose deposition still occurred under our experimental conditions . in line with recent publications the extent of triggered early and _PROTEIN_ cellular responses was not correlated in our set of tested mutants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . rosette leaves of the fer mutant frequently displayed tissue collapse at h after infiltration of which impeded accurate assessment of callose deposition and prompted us to further study potential anomalous cell death responses in this mutant . trypan blue staining revealed weak spontaneous cell death and occurrence of pronounced aberrant cell death after infiltration of into fer mutant rosette leaves but not after infiltration into leaves of control plants suggesting that fer is hypersensitive to mechanical or osmotic stress . to assess whether altered responses correlate with an altered immune response we quantitatively analyzed bacterial infection of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and fer mutants by spray inoculation with pseudomonas syringae pv tomato . this virulence compromised strain proliferates more slowly inside plant tissue and is expected to enable the detection of subtle differences in infection phenotypes . while we found no differences in bacterial growth compared with wild type plants upon spray inoculation of _PROTEIN_ we observed enhanced bacterial proliferation in _PROTEIN_ as early as hpi . because _PROTEIN_ is impaired in stomatal closure upon oxidative stress we hypothesized that it might also be defective in stomatal closure upon biotic stimuli allowing enhanced stomatal entry of bacteria . we quantitatively assessed stomatal aperture of _PROTEIN_ in response to and observed compromised triggered stomatal closure in this mutant . elevated bacterial titers in _PROTEIN_ mutant plants persisted until dpi and even exceeded bacterial growth in the _PROTEIN_ mutant at this time point . as expected the _PROTEIN_ mutant also did not exhibit triggered stomatal closure . in contrast the fer mutant had constitutively closed stomata and allowed less bacterial proliferation than wild type plants at dpi an effect that was rescued in the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgenic line .
full metabolic labeling of arabidopsis thaliana suspension cell cultures was carried out as described . briefly for the labeled cell cultures the conventional containing nitrogen source in the medium

alkylated in iodoacetamide and proteins were digested with endoproteinase lys c and trypsin . digested peptides were desalted over _PROTEIN_ tips before _METHOD_ spectrometric analysis . tryptic peptide mixtures were analyzed by _METHOD_ using nanoflow hplc _METHOD_ and a linear ion trap instrument as _METHOD_ analyzer . peptides were eluted from a analytical column on a linear gradient running from acetonitrile in min and sprayed directly into the ltq orbitrap _METHOD_ spectrometer . proteins were identified by tandem _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ via information dependent acquisition of fragmentation spectra of multiple charged peptides . full scans were obtained at a resolution of fwhm of and cid fragment spectra were acquired in the ltq . additional fragmentation through multistage activation was used if peptides displayed a loss of phosphoric acid upon _METHOD_ fragmentation . fragment _METHOD_ spectra from raw files were extracted as dta files and then merged to peak lists using default settings of dtasupercharge version with a tolerance for precursor ion detection of ppm . spectra were searched against a non redundant arabidopsis protein data base using the mascot algorithm _PROTEIN_ . the database contained the full arabidopsis proteome and commonly observed contaminants thus no taxonomic restrictions were used during automated data base search . the

experiments were set up using labeled and unlabeled cell cultures . the reciprocal labeling setup was chosen rather than an experimental setup using the same labeled cultures as repeated internal standard to specifically distinguish which proteins are responding to the treatment with or from those proteins that are a priori different between the labeled and unlabeled cell cultures . intensity ratios of the to form of each identified peptide were averaged across all peptides belonging to the same protein within one experimental set . protein abundance ratios were converted into _PROTEIN_
