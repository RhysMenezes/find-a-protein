in response to wounding and pathogens jasmonate serves as a signal molecule for both induction and repression of gene _PROTEIN_ . to examine defense regulated gene repression in arabidopsis we have identified a nonclassical arabinogalactan protein _PROTEIN_ gene _PROTEIN_ and show that its mrna _PROTEIN_ to about of its original level within h in response to methyl ja treatment of whole d old seedlings . wounding and abscisic acid treatment had similar effects . meja suppression primarily depends on the action of the ja signaling protein _PROTEIN_ as shown by much lower meja suppression in _PROTEIN_ mutant plants . the _PROTEIN_ mechanism of mrna suppression by meja is repression of transcription as shown by _LOCATION_ run on experiments . the _PROTEIN_ protein shares features with several known and putative nonclassical _PROTEIN_ from other species a putative signal peptide a histidine rich region near the n terminus followed by a repetitive proline rich domain and a cysteine rich c terminal _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ domain . positive yariv reagent interaction demonstrated that the protein is an _PROTEIN_ . monosaccharide analysis of purified _PROTEIN_ indicated it is a galactose rich _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ of an _PROTEIN_ enhanced green _METHOD_ protein fusion protein in transgenic cells revealed that the _PROTEIN_ protein was localized to the cell wall . _PROTEIN_ promoter _PROTEIN_ reporter gene analysis showed _PROTEIN_ in the vascular bundle throughout the plant except in the flower . in the flower _PROTEIN_ staining occurred throughout the pistil except in the stigma . the strong preferential _PROTEIN_ in vascular tissues suggests that _PROTEIN_ may be involved in vascular tissue function during both the defense response and development .
a blastp search was conducted to identify arabidopsis proteins with features and protein organization similar to the french bean protein including low tyr content . the gene with the greatest similarity throughout the encoded protein length was _GENE_ . using reverse transcription pcr we obtained a cdna clone spanning the complete open reading frame of _GENE_ . dna sequencing confirmed the annotation of _GENE_ . _GENE_ has one intron and a nucleotide untranslated region deduced from the cdna sequence . _GENE_ encodes a amino acid pro rich protein with four distinct domains a putative signal peptide followed by a his rich domain a middle repetitive pro rich domain and a c terminal non pro rich domain . in the pro rich domain there are only five types of amino acids with pro lys val ala and tyr . these amino acids form different exact repeat units . there are two long repeats with amino acids overlapping with four shorter amino acid repeats . these repeats are essentially composed of different variants of the basic repeat unit _PROTEIN_ . this degenerate quadripeptide is different from the typical pentapeptide _PROTEIN_ of other prps such as several atprps in arabidopsis and in medicago and is characteristic of a class of nonclassical _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ like proteins . also in common with these proteins the _GENE_ protein has a c terminal region with six well conserved cys residues that has been named _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . this domain also exists in the ole e pollen allergen in olive . the protein sequence of _GENE_ suggested that it may encode a nonclassical _PROTEIN_ . preceding the his rich domain there is a module apapap and there are six single ap duplets scattered in the prp domain . increasing evidence suggests that these ap modules are sites of _PROTEIN_ attachment in _PROTEIN_ . in addition to these putative o glycosylation sites there are two putative n glycosylation sites in the _PROTEIN_ region . based on these analyses we postulated that this protein might be a nonclassical _PROTEIN_ . further supporting evidence was provided using the _PROTEIN_ domain sequence to blast the genbank database . this identified several putative homologs among different species . among these putative homologs we searched for proteins that have similar structure predicted signal sequence n terminal his rich stretch a pro rich region with the repeat _PROTEIN_ and a _PROTEIN_ domain . after applying these criteria we identified several proteins and which we consider to be homologs of _GENE_ . among these homologs and have been shown to be bona fide nonclassical _PROTEIN_ . in the arabidopsis genome there are two genes _PROTEIN_ and _GENE_ showing similarity with _GENE_ . _PROTEIN_ shows the highest similarity with _GENE_ but it has no his rich domain . _GENE_ has only the _PROTEIN_ domain without his and pro rich domains . based on these analyses we concluded that _GENE_ is the only gene in this nonclassical _PROTEIN_ subclass in the arabidopsis genome . to determine whether _GENE_ is a bona fide _PROTEIN_ we used the promoter to overexpress the _GENE_ protein fused with a myc tag at the c terminal end in transgenic plants . a cell wall fraction was isolated from d old seedlings . proteins released by high salt extraction of this fraction were incubated with _PROTEIN_ yariv reagent a compound that selectively precipitates _PROTEIN_ . western blot analysis of the _PROTEIN_ fraction using an anti myc antibody detected the fusion protein and an endogenous nonspecific kd protein . this result demonstrates that _GENE_ is a bona fide _PROTEIN_ . the myc fusion protein detected by the antibody ran by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ as a broad high molecular _METHOD_ band of about to kd whereas the predicted molecular _METHOD_ of the mature _GENE_ protein alone is kd . in addition to this experiment we isolated the myc fusion protein from the high salt cell wall protein fraction by nickel nitrilotriacetic acid agarose _PROTEIN_ affinity purification capitalizing on the _PROTEIN_ that there is a his rich stretch near the n terminus of _GENE_ . the resulting enriched protein fraction spotted on nitrocellulose stained positively with yariv reagent . based on these analyses we concluded that _GENE_ encodes a nonclassical _PROTEIN_ and named it _PROTEIN_ . to examine its _PROTEIN_ composition and likely hydroxylation of pro residues we purified native _PROTEIN_ protein from transgenic plants overexpressing native _PROTEIN_ . transgenic lines were generated by introducing a genomic fragment that contains about kb upstream of translation start codon and about bp downstream of the translation stop codon of the _PROTEIN_ gene . due to the nature of agrobacterium transformation multiple copies of fragments are frequently introduced into plants and can exhibit higher mrna levels . plants of a transgenic line that showed a higher mrna level than wild type grown in liquid murashige and skoog medium were used to isolate the high salt eluted cell wall protein . _PROTEIN_ was purified by a ni _PROTEIN_ metal affinity column from high salt eluted cell wall protein and an aliquot subjected to trifluoromethanesulfonic _METHOD_ acid hydrolysis a treatment that removes the majority of _PROTEIN_ in glycoproteins . the _METHOD_ blue stained gel showed that acid hydrolysis resulted in a dramatic shift from the broad high molecular _METHOD_ band to a single prominent band of kd in the deglycosylated sample . it is noteworthy that the innermost asn linked n acetylglucosamine of an n linked oligosaccharide is resistant to _METHOD_ treatment . the observed higher than predicted molecular _METHOD_ migration may be due to nonuniform association of _PROTEIN_ with hrgp as suggested by others and possibly some residual n linked sugars . the identity of the band was identified by _PROTEIN_ assisted laser desorption time of flight _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ which covered of the _PROTEIN_ amino acid sequence . no other protein was identified by maldi tof _METHOD_ from the single band . together these findings demonstrate that _PROTEIN_ is a glycoprotein and that a highly purified preparation of _PROTEIN_ has been obtained . amino acid composition analysis of purified deglycosylated _PROTEIN_ showed approximately equal amounts of pro and hyp . another nonclassical _PROTEIN_ which is the homolog of _PROTEIN_ in nicotiana alata also has about equal amounts of pro and hyp . monosaccharide composition analysis showed that purified _PROTEIN_ contains mostly gal with lesser amounts of ara xyl fuc and man . in addition very low amounts of glc and glcua were detected . again _PROTEIN_ is very similar to which has a glycosyl composition of gal ara xyl and man . besides _PROTEIN_ 's interaction with the yariv reagent glycosyl composition analysis provided independent confirmation that _PROTEIN_ is an _PROTEIN_ . amino acid composition of _PROTEIN_ monosaccharide composition of _PROTEIN_ to investigate _PROTEIN_ gene _PROTEIN_ during the defense response the leaves of week old plants were mechanically wounded and directly wounded leaves were harvested at various times . rna blot analysis shows a _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ mrna level over the h time course . the kb size of the _PROTEIN_ transcript matches the expected size based on the cdna sequence . the glutathione s _PROTEIN_ transcript was also hybridized as a known wounding induced mrna whereas the _PROTEIN_ transcript was monitored to show equal loading . because ja and its derivatives are well known secondary messengers induced by wounding we also examined the effect of meja . meja treatment resulted in a _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ mrna to about of the original level by h . after h the _PROTEIN_ mrna level began to recover but remained below its original level through the h time course . in contrast control plants treated with the solvent exhibited only a slight _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ mrna . the marked induction of _PROTEIN_ mrna a known meja regulated mrna demonstrated effective meja exposure . control plants treated with solvent showed low level induction of _PROTEIN_ mrna especially at early time points . however compared with meja treated plants the response was much lower and diminished after h. aba has been shown to be involved in some plant defense responses and is widely active in the response to water stress and other abiotic stresses . to determine the _PROTEIN_ pattern of _PROTEIN_ mrna in response to aba we treated seedlings with aba and harvested after h. northern blot analysis showed that _PROTEIN_ mrna was also repressed by aba treatment . _PROTEIN_ has been shown to play a pivotal role in ja signaling . based on microarray data it has been estimated that about one half of ja signaling involves the action of this protein which encodes an f box protein as part of the ubiquitin ligase complex . although slight repression was still observed _PROTEIN_ mrna repression in response to meja was dramatically reduced in the _PROTEIN_ mutant compared to the response in wild type plants indicating the _PROTEIN_ mrna repression is _PROTEIN_ dependent on the _PROTEIN_ pathway . interestingly the basal level of _PROTEIN_ mrna is similar in untreated plants of both genetic backgrounds . in french bean repression of mrna is due to mrna stability regulation with no change in the rate of transcription . to evaluate these two parameters for _PROTEIN_ regulation we performed a _LOCATION_ run on assay to measure the transcription rate of the _PROTEIN_ gene after meja treatment . because arabidopsis cultured cells can provide a large quantity of homogeneous cells the run on assay was carried out with cultured cell _LOCATION_ . figure shows that meja treatment of cultured cells resulted in _PROTEIN_ mrna repression similar to the response in whole plants . _LOCATION_ from the same batches of cells were used for run on transcription assays . the results show that _PROTEIN_ mrna repression reflected _PROTEIN_ transcription rate . moreover the magnitude of transcription reduction correlates well with the observed reduction in the steady state mrna level to approximately of the original level . a known meja induced gene ethylene response _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ showed increased transcription whereas the rates of and _PROTEIN_ transcription were essentially unchanged . to investigate whether mrna stability regulation may also play a role the _PROTEIN_ utr was inserted downstream of a luc reporter coding sequence . agrobacterium mediated transformation generally results in the concatenated insertion of several t dna copies at a single locus . to avoid possible generation of double stranded rnas and rna interference processes that could variously impact the steady state mrna levels transgenic plants were screened to identify single copy insertions by southern blot as described by citation . analysis of three lines of transgenic plants containing single copy insertions showed that the luc reporter mrna level remained approximately constant in meja treated plants whereas the endogenous _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mrnas showed expected regulation . the results suggest that meja induced down regulation of _PROTEIN_ mrna does not involve mrna destabilization through the utr sequence . whereas mrna stability regulation commonly operates through the utr the evidence does not rule out a role for another part of the transcript or the utr plus another sequence in conferring meja induced mrna stability regulation . together with the run on data our results support predominant regulation by repression of transcription . _PROTEIN_ protein is predicted to be a cell wall or secreted protein based on its putative signal sequence and past findings of these locations for numerous _PROTEIN_ . to establish the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ enhanced _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was fused to the c terminal end of _PROTEIN_ to form an _METHOD_ fusion construct under the control of the promoter . the constructs were stably _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis transgenic plants and also bombarded into onion epidermal cells to _PROTEIN_ the fusion protein transiently . figure a and b shows confocal microscope views of the same root section from stable transgenic arabidopsis plants . the _METHOD_ signal indicated that the fusion protein was localized to the cell periphery . in bombarded onion epidermal cells the _METHOD_ alone construct showed intracellular localization including a commonly observed presence in the _LOCATION_ . to distinguish between cell wall and cell _LOCATION_ locations the transiently transformed cells were treated with m mannitol to induce plasmolysis . as shown in figure mannitol treatment effectively contracted the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ from the cell periphery in a cell that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ alone . the corresponding _METHOD_ image showed that _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was also contracted with the cytoplasm . in contrast in a plasmolyzed transgenic cell _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein a significant portion of the fusion protein was found at the cell periphery indicating cell wall localization . some fusion protein was also seen more faintly inside the cell and at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ which would be consistent with intermediate locations of the protein during its biogenesis . the _PROTEIN_ myc fusion protein was also highly enriched in the high salt elution fraction from partially purified cell walls . in work from other researchers _PROTEIN_ was also identified in a cell wall proteomics study and this is consistent with our data indicating that _PROTEIN_ is a cell wall protein . toward understanding the biological function of this protein during defense and normal development we characterized the _PROTEIN_ mrna _PROTEIN_ level in roots leaves _METHOD_ and inflorescences of arabidopsis plants . rna blot analysis showed that _PROTEIN_ mrna was _PROTEIN_ in all parts of the plant with the roots and inflorescences having the highest _PROTEIN_ levels . to determine the _PROTEIN_ pattern of the _PROTEIN_ gene more precisely we made transgenic plants harboring the bacterial uida gene under the control of a kb fragment extending upstream from the _PROTEIN_ start codon . this construct is termed the _PROTEIN_ promoter gus reporter construct _PROTEIN_ . the gus _PROTEIN_ pattern based on histochemical staining for gus activity revealed that the _PROTEIN_ promoter gus reporter gene was predominantly _PROTEIN_ in the vascular bundles throughout the plants . in flowers apart from staining vascular bundles in sepals and stamen filaments gus was also _PROTEIN_ throughout pistils except for stigmas . in roots gus stain was predominant in vascular bundles without appearance in the root tip regions . cross section of the root showed gus activity was broadly distributed through the vascular bundle including the phloem and primary xylem .
