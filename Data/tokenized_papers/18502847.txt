plant morphogenesis depends on _PROTEIN_ exocytic and endocytic _LOCATION_ trafficking . members of the arabidopsis thaliana dynamin related protein subfamily are required for _PROTEIN_ cell expansion and cytokinesis . using a combination of live cell imaging techniques we show that a functional _PROTEIN_ green _METHOD_ fusion protein _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was localized at the division plane in dividing cells and to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ in expanding interphase cells . in both tip growing root hairs and diffuse _PROTEIN_ expanding epidermal cells _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ organized into dynamic foci at the cell cortex which colocalized with a clathrin light chain _METHOD_ fusion protein _METHOD_ suggesting that _PROTEIN_ may participate in clathrin mediated _LOCATION_ dynamics . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and clc _METHOD_ foci dynamics are dependent on _LOCATION_ organization cytoplasmic streaming and functional clathrin mediated endocytic traffic . our studies provide insight into and clathrin dynamics in the plant cell cortex and indicate that the clathrin endocytic machinery in plants has both similarities and striking differences to that in mammalian cells and yeast .
to determine the cellular distribution of _PROTEIN_ a _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ translational fusion _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was constructed and introduced into _PROTEIN_ plants . to ensure normal _PROTEIN_ and localization of _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ a genomic fragment of _PROTEIN_ including kb of the native promoter which is known to complement the _PROTEIN_ pollen defect was positioned at the n terminus of _METHOD_ . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ rescued the development of _PROTEIN_ pollen and _PROTEIN_ plants transformed with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ had no visual defects . immunoblot analysis of total protein extracts from plants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ confirmed that the fusion protein was intact and _PROTEIN_ at levels similar to native _PROTEIN_ . together these data indicated that the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein was functional in vivo . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was _PROTEIN_ throughout pollen germination . _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was first observed in hydrated pollen and localized to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ but was not detected in pollen from untransformed plants . during pollen grain germination _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ localized _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ converged to the region near the aperture through which the pollen tube would emerge . as the pollen tube continued to grow _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ remained in the distal end of the pollen tube in the cytoplasm and along the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . as previously observed in roots using _METHOD_ _METHOD_ localized to the division plane in the transition zone of roots and to the distal region of elongating root hairs . in addition live cell imaging showed that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ associated with the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ in these cell types . in aboveground tissue _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was _PROTEIN_ in hypocotyls leaf pavement and socket cells and in developing leaf trichomes where it localized to both the cell cortex and the cytoplasm . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was not observed to be associated with any cytoskeletal structures or mitochondria in dividing or nondividing cells as was previously reported . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ did not colocalize with the mitochondrial tracer dye mitotracker orange cm in root epidermal cells or cortical cells . to confirm the lack of mitochondrial localization roots _PROTEIN_ a _METHOD_ tagged mitochondria signal sequence fusion protein _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were fixed and probed with an antibody specific for _PROTEIN_ . again _PROTEIN_ did not associate with the ss _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ mitochondrial marker . previous studies have shown that arabidopsis are involved in _PROTEIN_ cell expansion . root hairs are a model cell for the study of _PROTEIN_ cell growth as they expand through _LOCATION_ addition exclusively at the tip . many signaling and _LOCATION_ trafficking pathways that are required to establish and _PROTEIN_ this _PROTEIN_ cell growth have been characterized . thus we analyzed the in vivo dynamics of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in these tip growing cells . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was not evenly distributed throughout the root hair but was primarily localized at the distal end during all stages of root hair development beginning with the appearance of the first bulge and continuing through to termination of root hair growth . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ levels at the distal end of the root hair _PROTEIN_ as root hairs stopped growing and eventually reached levels similar to the rest of the root hair _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . to investigate the dynamics of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ during root hair growth with greater time resolution seedlings were grown at a horizontal angle through half strength murashige and skoog _METHOD_ agar medium on a glass cover slip to allow root hairs to elongate in one plane without disturbance . root hairs that grew along the surface of the glass cover slip were imaged using _PROTEIN_ . root hairs appeared morphologically normal throughout the h of imaging . their growth rate oscillated over time with rates varying between and which was consistent with root hair growth dynamics observed previously . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ localized to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ primarily at the tip apex which is the site of _LOCATION_ addition and the _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ within of the apex _PROTEIN_ as well as throughout the circulating cytoplasm . as the root hair elongated the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ associated _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ intensity fluctuated both at the _PROTEIN_ flanks and at the tip apex throughout the h of imaging . the highest _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ intensities at the tip apex were observed when the growth rate of the root hair was lowest . at the fastest growth rates only of total _LOCATION_ associated _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was located at the tip apex . by contrast at the slowest rate of the total _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ associated _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was present at the root hair tip apex . this analysis suggested an inverse relationship between the localization of _PROTEIN_ at the tip apex where exocytosis occurs and the rate of root hair growth during expansion . we performed a frap analysis to determine how _PROTEIN_ is recruited to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ at the root hair tips . _PROTEIN_ could be recruited directly from the cytoplasm and/or delivered to the tip apex via an exocytic pathway and then diffuse into the root hair tip flanks during periods of rapid growth . to test these models the diffusion of _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ associated _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ at the tip _PROTEIN_ flanks of expanding root hairs was analyzed . if _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were recruited directly from the cytoplasm the _METHOD_ in the entire photobleached area would recover at a uniform rate . alternatively if _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ localization depended on initial delivery to the root hair apex and subsequent diffusion the initial _METHOD_ recovery would occur at the edge of the photobleached area . as a control the _METHOD_ recovery rate of the cytoplasmic pool was determined which recovered to its original intensity in s . the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ associated _METHOD_ recovered in s indicating that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ did not freely diffuse at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . the photobleached area of the root hair tip flank was divided into two regions one comprising the peripheral two thirds of the photobleached area and the other comprising the inner one third of the bleached area . in of the root hairs the peripheral and inner regions recovered with equal kinetics suggesting that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was primarily recruited from the cytoplasm _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . root hair growth has been shown to require calcium gradients and reactive oxygen species as signaling modules phosphatidylinositol metabolism actin dynamics and a functional secretory pathway . to determine if these processes are also required for _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ dynamics in root hairs were analyzed before during and after the addition of inhibitors of the above processes including _METHOD_ brefeldin a cytochalasin d or tyrphostin . unlike the control treatment which did not affect growth each inhibitor caused a cessation of root hair growth to min after inhibitor addition . with the exception of tyrphostin _PROTEIN_ localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ at the apical and _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ was abolished within min of growth cessation resulting in a nonpolar distribution of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ throughout the root hair . these results suggested that the known requirements for active root hair tip growth are most likely not directly required for _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ recruitment or dynamics at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ but that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ localization at the tip of root hairs is intimately tied with active growth . this is supported by the result that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was not mislocalized in several root hair mutants including the tip growth expansion mutants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ cob cob and _LOCATION_ . inhibits mammalian ap binding of endocytic cargo and has been shown to block cme in mammalian cells and endocytic traffic in plants . although cme has not yet been shown to be required for tip growth in arabidopsis clathrin coated structures have been observed at the flanks of root hair tips . we sought to determine if disrupting cme would alter the dynamics of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in root hairs . within min of application root hair growth slowed and stopped . . in contrast with the other inhibitor treatments _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ at the apical or _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ but never completely disappeared upon growth cessation . instead _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ remained localized at the tip up to min after growth of the root hair had ceased . a further analysis of the effects of on _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ dynamics is presented below . to examine _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ dynamics at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ of transformed plants vaem was used which allows for imaging of the plant cell cortex with a high signal to noise ratio . the distribution of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was visualized using vaem in root hair tips and flanks expanding epidermal cells of the differentiation and elongation zone of the root mature atrichoblasts in the root leaf pavement cells hypocotyl epidermal cells and guard cells . in all cell types _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was prominently organized into discreet cortical associated foci . to eliminate any differences that may occur in different cell types _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ foci were initially analyzed in expanding root epidermal cells . in addition only foci that had lifetimes of > s were included in the analysis . each of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ foci that appeared also disappeared during the min of imaging . the average lifetime of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ foci was s . when first appearing the foci had low but detectable _METHOD_ that increased steadily . upon reaching peak _METHOD_ intensity the _METHOD_ rapidly _PROTEIN_ to background levels and the foci disappeared from the cell cortex . this behavior was characteristic of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ foci as suggested by the average normalized _METHOD_ intensity of foci which were centered at peak intensity . in addition the foci were largely immobile with of the foci exhibiting no _PROTEIN_ movement in the imaging plane . the remaining foci were immobile for > of their lifetime at the cell cortex but were mobile within the image plane and exhibited additional behaviors including foci splitting foci fusion and dimming without disappearing . in addition short lived foci that did not fluctuate in _METHOD_ intensity and long lived foci that underwent several rounds of _METHOD_ intensity fluctuations were also present . besides having limited mobility in the image plane the foci exhibited movement just out of the plane of focus as they disappeared from the cell cortex . seventy percent of foci were observed moving out of focus presumably deeper into the cytoplasm within s of completely disappearing most likely due to cytoplasmic streaming . endocytic _LOCATION_ trafficking is more active in expanding than in nonexpanding cells . to determine if the distribution or dynamics of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ foci were also different we compared the density and behavior of foci in the expansion zone of root epidermal cells with those in fully expanded root epidermal cells . although the focus lifetimes were quite variable within a single cell ranging from to s in both expanding and nonexpanding epidermal root cells the average lifetime of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ foci did not vary widely between cell types . the average lifetime was s in expanding root epidermal cells and s in nonexpanding root epidermal cells . by contrast the density of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ foci varied between cell types with the highest density being measured in actively expanding cells . in addition more foci exhibited splitting and fusion in expanding cells than in nonexpanding cells . to test the hypothesis that _PROTEIN_ plays a role in endocytosis _PROTEIN_ seedlings transformed with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were treated with which was previously shown to inhibit endocytic traffic in cultured plant cells . after min of treatment with of the cortical associated foci imaged with vaem began to increase in size and _METHOD_ intensity and the cytoplasmic pools of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ began to _METHOD_ into immobile structures with high _METHOD_ _METHOD_ as viewed by time lapse _PROTEIN_ . thirty min after the addition of the cortical and cytoplasmic associated _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ signal was observed in immobile cortical associated foci and cytoplasmic structures respectively . after min of treatment < of the cortical foci entered or disappeared from the cell cortex during min of imaging . by contrast the phosphotyrosine analog tyrphostin which does not inhibit mammalian cargo interaction had no effect on localization or behavior of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . the effect of was rapidly reversible with a complete disappearance of immobile cytoplasmic _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ structures within min of washout . most likely does not inhibit the _PROTEIN_ activity of _PROTEIN_ as had no inhibitory effect on the _PROTEIN_ activity of escherichia coli _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ which is identical to _PROTEIN_ in its _PROTEIN_ domain . cortical associated _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ displayed characteristics that were reminiscent of the dynamics of dynamin during cme . based on this and our finding that inhibits _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ dynamics clc _METHOD_ fusion proteins were created and _PROTEIN_ in planta for real time imaging of clathrin dynamics at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . _METHOD_ fusions of clc have been successfully used for illuminating clathrin dynamics in yeast and mammalian cells . c terminal fusions to _METHOD_ morange or enhanced cyan _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ were used . all three clc fusion proteins exhibited similar localizations to intracellular organelles that colocalized with the tgn marker n sialyl transferase _METHOD_ within the cytoplasm and at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ of root epidermal cells and root hairs . _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ associated clc _METHOD_ exhibited a similar distribution as _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in growing root hairs . in time lapse images clc _METHOD_ was localized to the tip flanks in growing root hairs and redistributed to the tip most region of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ as growth ceased . clc _METHOD_ localization at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ was examined using vaem . similar to _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ associated clc _METHOD_ were organized into dynamic discreet foci . clc _METHOD_ foci had a similar lifetime distribution as _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in expanding root epidermal cells with the average lifetime of s. the density of clc _METHOD_ foci was also similar in expanding root epidermal cells to that of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . actin dynamics and _LOCATION_ sterols are required for efficient cme in mammals and yeast . to determine cellular components that are required for _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and clc _METHOD_ dynamics seedlings were treated with molecular inhibitors of cytoskeletal dynamics sterol synthesis and _LOCATION_ and protein trafficking and then imaged with vaem . specifically and latrunculin b oryzalin mm butanedione monoxime fenpropimorph wortmannin and brefeldin a were assessed and their effects were compared with mock treatment with _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . inhibitors were used at concentrations previously shown to effectively inhibit their corresponding cellular processes and where possible inhibition was visually confirmed as described below . all inhibitors except wortmannin and brefeldin a had significant effects on foci dynamics . seedling roots were treated with low and high concentrations of latb for min to inhibit cytoplasmic streaming independent and dependent processes respectively . f actin depolymerization was verified using the actin probe _METHOD_ . at latb there was no effect on _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ foci dynamics and a small but significant increase in clc _METHOD_ average focus lifetime . however at latb concentrations that inhibited cytoplasmic streaming as viewed in bright field images > of the cortical associated immobile _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and clc _METHOD_ foci that were present at the beginning of imaging were present after min . besides this immobile population of clc _METHOD_ foci were in constant motion in and out of the plane of focus which was not observed in mock treated clc _METHOD_ seedlings . to determine if the effects of actin inhibition on foci dynamics were due to cytoplasmic streaming seedlings were incubated with bdm a myosin inhibitor for min . both _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and clc _METHOD_ foci became immobile . foci that were present at the beginning of imaging rarely disappeared from the cell cortex . clc _METHOD_ also formed constantly mobile foci similar to those observed after treatment with latb . in addition _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ foci increased in size and _METHOD_ intensity similar to those observed after treatment . microtubules are the major cytoskeletal component of the cortex of plant cells . thus microtubule organization may be important for regulating processes at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . to examine the role of the microtubule _LOCATION_ on cortical associated _PROTEIN_ and clc dynamics expanding epidermal root cells _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or clc _METHOD_ were imaged after min incubation with oryzalin which caused complete depolymerization of microtubules as assessed by a microtubule binding domain _METHOD_ reporter . both _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and clc _METHOD_ foci had a wider lifetime distribution than with _METHOD_ treatment and the average focus lifetime of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and clc _METHOD_ with oryzalin treatment was and times respectively that of mock treated roots . in addition _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and clc _METHOD_ had a greater mobility within the plane of the cell cortex after treatment with oryzalin . twice as many cortical associated _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ foci were observed to split and/or merge and more than twice as many clc _METHOD_ foci moved _PROTEIN_ in the cell cortex compared with mock treated roots . interestingly foci dynamics were greatly inhibited in the absence of both the actin and microtubule _LOCATION_ . in seedlings incubated with oryzalin and latb for min _PROTEIN_ and clc foci displayed an average focus lifetime of s and s respectively . in addition the mobile _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and clc _METHOD_ foci that were present in mock treated seedlings or with either drug alone were not apparent in seedlings treated with both oryzalin and latb with < of _PROTEIN_ and clc foci being mobile within the cell cortex . plant cell expansion and division are greatly affected by sterols present in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . cme in mammalian cells also requires the presence of sterols in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . fenpropimorph has been used as a sterol synthesis inhibitor to probe the effects of altered _LOCATION_ sterol profiles on plant morphology . seedlings germinated and grown on half strength _METHOD_ fenpropimorph had altered _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and clc _METHOD_ foci dynamics . the average _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ foci lifetime from seedlings grown on fenpropimorph was s which was times that of seedlings grown on _METHOD_ media . likewise the average lifetime of clc _METHOD_ foci when seedlings were grown on fenpropimorph was s which was times that of seedlings grown on half strength _METHOD_ . together these inhibitor studies indicated that the cortical environment was critical for efficient _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and clc _METHOD_ foci dynamics . as cortical associated _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and clc _METHOD_ foci displayed very similar dynamics we decided to test whether these foci colocalize in the cell cortex . plants _PROTEIN_ both _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and clc morange were imaged using dual _METHOD_ color vaem imaging . as demonstrated by single fluorophore imaging both _PROTEIN_ and clc fusion proteins formed discreet foci in the cell cortex . clc morange was also found in larger structures that represent tgns . we found that of pixels that had green _METHOD_ above an intensity threshold that included all _METHOD_ within the cell boundaries also contained morange _METHOD_ above the intensity threshold . conversely only of pixels that contained orange _METHOD_ above threshold intensity also contained green _METHOD_ above the threshold intensity . this was most likely due to the tgn associated clc morange _METHOD_ signal . on the other hand when only foci were analyzed for the presence of green or orange _METHOD_ of all clc morange foci analyzed overlapped with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ foci while of all _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ foci analyzed overlapped with clc morange foci . the total percentage of overlapping foci was . to eliminate the possibility that the high percentage of colocalization was due to random overlap of the highly dense foci in the cell cortex of elongating epidermal cells the red channel image from eight different cells was rotated with respect to the green channel an analysis technique that has been used previously to show nonrandom colocalization . the average peak distance for the original image was significantly different from that of the rotated images indicating that the colocalization was statistically significant . the dynamics of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and clc morange were analyzed for foci from expanding epidermal root cells in individual roots that displayed overlapping _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and clc morange localization . in of these foci the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and clc morange _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ within s of each other suggesting that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and clc morange resided on the same structure in the cell cortex . of those that displayed simultaneous disappearance of foci had simultaneous rise in _METHOD_ indicating that the fluorophores were recruited concurrently while of foci were characterized by a peak in clc morange _METHOD_ before _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ suggesting a stepwise recruitment . furthermore of all foci had concurrent recruitment of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and clc morange but did not have simultaneous disappearance . the time difference between the disappearances of the two foci ranged from to s. finally of foci did not display coordinated dynamics of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and clc morange .
the _METHOD_ plant _PROTEIN_ vector was constructed as follows a sali/hpai _PROTEIN_ genomic construct from which included kb of untranslated and promoter elements and of _PROTEIN_ were subcloned into containing _METHOD_ and the nopaline synthase terminator using smai and sali sites _PROTEIN_ . the native was removed from _PROTEIN_ by restriction digestion using kpni and saci sites and a _PROTEIN_

_METHOD_ was constructed as follows the coding sequence for _METHOD_ was pcr amplified from _METHOD_ using primers gagctcatggtgagcaagggcgaggag and gagctcttagtacagctcgtccatgccgagagtga subcloned as a

fragment into _METHOD_ nos resulting in clc _METHOD_ . the dna sequence of all constructs was verified . arabidopsis thaliana ecotype wassilewskija wild type or _PROTEIN_ plants were transformed with the constructs for clc _METHOD_ or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ respectively using the agrobacterium tumefaciens mediated floral dip method . transgenic plants were selected either on solid medium half strength _METHOD_ medium containing kanamycin _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or on soil sprayed once with ammonium _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . to determine _PROTEIN_ level of the transgenic _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ construct total protein extracts were prepared from wild type wild type transformed with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ transformed with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ seedlings grown vertically on half strength _METHOD_ phytagar . seven day old seedlings were homogenized in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ sample buffer incubated at for min and insoluble debris was cleared by centrifugation at for min at room temperature . the supernatant was separated on a _PROTEIN_ polyacrylamide gel and analyzed by immunoblotting as described using anti _PROTEIN_ and biotin conjugated anti _METHOD_ antibodies . hrp conjugated anti rabbit secondary antibodies and hrp conjugated streptavidin were used to detect the primary antibodies and anti _PROTEIN_ and anti _METHOD_ respectively . for indirect immunolocalization of in plants _PROTEIN_ ss _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ d old seedlings that were grown vertically on half strength _METHOD_ phytagar were fixed in formaldehyde in pme _PROTEIN_ for h under vacuum . all subsequent incubations were conducted at room temperature in a humid chamber unless otherwise noted . fixed seedlings were washed in pme placed on probe on plus slides dried on a slide warmer at incubated in permeabilization buffer for min and treated with pectolyase and macroenzyme in pme for min . the roots were then washed in triton x in pme and then in pme . for immunolabeling the roots were blocked with bsa in pme for h and probed with anti _PROTEIN_ in pme bsa overnight at . roots were then washed in pme bsa and incubated with conjugated anti rabbit antibodies in pme bsa for h. afterward roots were washed with pme bsa covered with vectashield topped with a cover slip and sealed with fingernail polish . to examine the association of _PROTEIN_ with mitochondria d old _PROTEIN_ seedlings transformed with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were incubated with mitotracker orange cm in half strength _METHOD_ for min at room temperature and rinsed for min in half strength _METHOD_ before imaging . all _PROTEIN_ images except for those of the frap experiments were captured using a nikon u inverted confocal laser scanning microscope fitted with a numerical aperture planapo vc objective lens and ez acquisition software . for colocalization studies in epidermal and cortical cells _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ ss _METHOD_ were excited at nm while mitotracker orange and _PROTEIN_ were excited at nm . clc _METHOD_ were detected using nm light _METHOD_ nm light or nm light _METHOD_ . all dual color imaging was performed using sequential scans to prevent bleed through _METHOD_ . for imaging of trichomes _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ seedlings with one to two pairs of true leaves were selected and the roots were removed . seedlings were inverted onto a cover slip within water and covered by a glass slide . pollen was allowed to germinate in vitro as described previously on a glass slide for to h covered with a cover slip and imaged with _PROTEIN_ as described above except a na planapo lens was used . for time lapse imaging of growing root hairs seedlings were grown on half strength _METHOD_ phytagar coated cover slips as described and imaged by _PROTEIN_ with either the or objective lens . one hundred and fifty microliters of half strength _METHOD_ sucrose was pipetted on top of the agar and covered with parafilm to prevent desiccation during imaging . frap experiments were performed on a zeiss meta confocal microscope equipped with a na planapo chromat objective . circular or rectangular areas were photobleached using iterations of the nm line from a mw argon laser

described . briefly seedlings were transferred from vertically growing plates to a glass slide with of half strength _METHOD_ and covered with a cover slip . plants were imaged with a nikon eclipse u fitted with the nikon t fl _PROTEIN_ attachment and a nikon _PROTEIN_ plan apo _PROTEIN_ objective . for double fluorophore imaging _METHOD_ and morange were excited with a and nm laser respectively

recombined using the average projection command on image j . root hair length was calculated from xyz coordinates of the tip and base of the root hair . for growing root hairs time series images were captured every to s and compiled using image j . growth rate was determined using metamorph 's track points application . an intensity threshold value was assigned to each root hair so that the maximum number of pixels in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ was included and the number of pixels in the cytoplasm was limited . threshold area was calculated using the region measurements application in metamorph . analysis of frap _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ clc _METHOD_ and clc morange foci dynamics was performed using image j. _METHOD_ recovery in the frap experiments was corrected for photobleaching as follows . the percentage of inherent photobleaching _PROTEIN_ for each frame during recovery was determined by measuring the change in _METHOD_ intensity of a region that was not initially photobleached . this _METHOD_ intensity in the initial bleached regions was multiplied by _PROTEIN_ for each frame . a focus was identified by a local increase in intensity above a designated threshold assigned to each time lapse image for > s. foci dynamics were analyzed for plants that were grown on half strength _METHOD_ solid medium and imaged in half strength _METHOD_ liquid medium .

of interest multi measure plugin . circular rois included all pixels of the focus and a mean intensity for the roi was recorded . to determine if colocalization was random the green channel of dual color images was rotated relative to the red image using adobe photoshop _METHOD_ . the distance from each focus in the green channel to the nearest focus in the red channel was measured using metamorph . all images for figures were processed in adobe photoshop . tyrphostin cytochalasin d wortmannin brefeldin a and latb were _PROTEIN_ from emd biosciences oryzalin was _PROTEIN_ from restek
