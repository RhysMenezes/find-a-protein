proteins are a family of conserved phospho specific binding proteins involved in diverse physiological processes . plants have large gene families and many binding partners have been identified though relatively few functions have been defined . here we demonstrate that proteins interact with multiple aminocyclopropane _PROTEIN_ synthase _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in arabidopsis thaliana . _PROTEIN_ catalyzes the generally rate limiting step in the biosynthesis of the phytohormone ethylene . this interaction increases the stability of the _PROTEIN_ proteins . also interact with the ethylene _PROTEIN_ like a group of three functionally redundant proteins that are components of a cullin ubiquitin ligase that target a subset of the _PROTEIN_ proteins for rapid degradation by the proteasome . in contrast with _PROTEIN_ the interaction with destabilizes the _PROTEIN_ . the level of the _PROTEIN_ in vivo plays a role in mediating _PROTEIN_ protein turnover with increased levels leading to a _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ protein levels . these studies demonstrate that regulation of ethylene biosynthesis occurs by a mechanism in which proteins act through a direct interaction and stabilization of _PROTEIN_ and through _PROTEIN_ the abundance of the ubiquitin ligases that target a subset of _PROTEIN_ proteins for degradation .
we examined the interaction between _PROTEIN_ and using a bimolecular _METHOD_ complementation assay . the isoform interacted in this assay with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ which represent a type type and type _PROTEIN_ respectively . a strong _METHOD_ signal was observed in the cytoplasm of tobacco epidermal cells _PROTEIN_ both _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ fusion proteins but not with the nonrelevant _PROTEIN_ fusions which serve as negative controls . disruption of the c terminal toe domain of a type _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ which is required for the interaction with _PROTEIN_ did not affect the interaction with . this is consistent with the observation that interacted with all three classes of _PROTEIN_ proteins two of which lack the toe domain . the interaction between and _PROTEIN_ proteins was confirmed in vivo using a coimmunoprecipitation assay from arabidopsis transgenic seedlings _PROTEIN_ myc tagged _PROTEIN_ protein . we examined the interaction of other _METHOD_ of with _PROTEIN_ using the bifc assay in transiently transfected tobacco epidermal cells . all four _METHOD_ of tested interacted with _PROTEIN_ indicating that at least in this assay there was no specificity in the interaction between and _PROTEIN_ proteins . consistent with this previous results suggested that _METHOD_ are often at least partially functionally redundant . the _PROTEIN_ peptide is a strong competitive inhibitor of client protein interactions . it has a high affinity for different _METHOD_ which enables the peptide to disrupt a wide array of interactions . in plants _PROTEIN_ has been shown to alter function in arabidopsis leaf disks . the ability of _PROTEIN_ and a nonfunctional form of the peptide _PROTEIN_ to disrupt the interaction between _PROTEIN_ and was examined . we first examined the effect of _PROTEIN_ on the bifc interaction between _PROTEIN_ and . there were two distinctive classes of _METHOD_ observed in the bifc assays of _PROTEIN_ and in arabidopsis protoplasts . approximately percent of the transformed protoplasts generated strong punctate _METHOD_ when transformed with plasmids _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ while the rest showed very faint weak signals distributed throughout the cytoplasm . the percentage of the protoplasts showing strong _METHOD_ was greatly reduced following incubation with _PROTEIN_ peptide . by contrast the mutated _PROTEIN_ peptide had little or no effect in this assay . we next examined the effect of _PROTEIN_ on the in planta interaction of _PROTEIN_ and . treatment of seedlings with _PROTEIN_ peptide but not with an _PROTEIN_ control resulted in a _PROTEIN_ in the amount of that coimmunoprecipitated with myc _PROTEIN_ . likewise treatment of protoplasts _PROTEIN_ myc _PROTEIN_ and ha with _PROTEIN_ peptide resulted in a _PROTEIN_ in the level of myc _PROTEIN_ that coimmunoprecipitated with ha protein . together these results indicate that _PROTEIN_ and proteins exist as a complex and that this interaction can be effectively disrupted in vivo using the _PROTEIN_ peptide . in order to determine whether the interaction with affects _PROTEIN_ protein stability the levels of a myc epitope tagged _PROTEIN_ protein were examined following treatment with either _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ peptide . the steady state level of myc _PROTEIN_ protein was reduced approximately threefold in etiolated transgenic seedlings h after treatment with _PROTEIN_ peptide . by contrast _PROTEIN_ protein levels were comparable in seedlings treated with either _PROTEIN_ or a murashige and skoog _METHOD_ medium control . the _PROTEIN_ in myc _PROTEIN_ protein levels in _PROTEIN_ treated seedlings was not the result of a _PROTEIN_ in the myc _PROTEIN_ transcript levels and thus likely reflects changes in protein stability . similar to _PROTEIN_ myc _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ protein levels were reduced in the presence of _PROTEIN_ peptide in etiolated seedlings . while the _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ levels was less than that observed for _PROTEIN_ it was very reproducible and significant _PROTEIN_ and may reflect the relatively long half life of _PROTEIN_ protein . we next studied whether the _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ protein levels in _PROTEIN_ treated seedlings is posttranscriptionally regulated through ubiquitin/proteasome activity . the proteasome inhibitor abrogated the _PROTEIN_ in myc _PROTEIN_ in response to _PROTEIN_ treatment in etiolated seedlings suggesting that the destabilization caused by disruption of the interaction is proteasome dependent . a transient _PROTEIN_ system in arabidopsis protoplasts was used to determine if the interaction with protein increases the half life of _PROTEIN_ . coexpression of ha increased the half life of myc tagged _PROTEIN_ protein in this system . the level of myc _PROTEIN_ protein _PROTEIN_ approximately threefold after h of inhibition of de novo protein synthesis by cycloheximide treatment . by contrast when a _PROTEIN_ plasmid was cotransformed with the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plasmid there was almost no _PROTEIN_ in myc _PROTEIN_ protein levels even after h of cycloheximide treatment . together these results indicate that positively regulates _PROTEIN_ protein stability via the proteasome dependent pathway . in addition to the _PROTEIN_ protein both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were identified in complexes using a tandem affinity purification approach . as previously demonstrated in etiolated seedlings _PROTEIN_ acts partially redundantly with _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ to negatively regulate ethylene biosynthesis in light grown seedlings . we hypothesized that similar to the function of in its interactions with both and its cognate ligases in mammalian cells may downregulate the stability of the _PROTEIN_ ligase components in arabidopsis . to test this we first confirmed the previously reported interaction of and eols using a bifc approach . consistent with the prior report we observed a positive interaction between and both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . surprisingly the bifc _METHOD_ observed in these interactions was localized not only in the cytoplasm but also in the _LOCATION_ colocalizing with a _LOCATION_ red _METHOD_ protein marker _METHOD_ . we thus examined the localization of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ fusions and _METHOD_ fusion protein . all three proteins were localized in both the _LOCATION_ and cytoplasm consistent with the bifc results . similar to the interaction the _PROTEIN_ interacted with multiple different _METHOD_ of suggesting that at least with the bifc assay there is no specificity in the interactions of with either _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ . interaction of _PROTEIN_ and was confirmed in vivo with a coimmunoprecipitation assay using arabidopsis ha epitope tagged _PROTEIN_ transgenic seedlings _PROTEIN_ and this interaction was disrupted by _PROTEIN_ peptide . together these results confirmed that _PROTEIN_ exists as a complex with protein and its interaction is disrupted by _PROTEIN_ peptide . the effects of on the steady state level of _PROTEIN_ protein was examined using transiently transformed arabidopsis protoplasts . a fixed quantity of plasmid designed to _PROTEIN_ ha _PROTEIN_ and increasing amounts of plasmid designed to _PROTEIN_ ha were cotransformed along with a compensating amount of empty vector plasmid . the steady state level of ha _PROTEIN_ protein _PROTEIN_ as the _PROTEIN_ of ha increased . the half life of ha _PROTEIN_ was greatly shortened in the presence of ha compared with that of ha _PROTEIN_ without added . blocked the effect of _PROTEIN_ on ha _PROTEIN_ turnover suggesting that mediated destabilization of _PROTEIN_ is dependent on ubiquitin/proteasome activity . to test this we examined the effect of _PROTEIN_ on the ubiquitination of _PROTEIN_ using an ha tagged ubiquitin in mesophyll protoplasts . as expected coexpression with myc reduced the steady state level of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . furthermore there was substantially more of the polyubiquitinated form _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ when coexpressed with myc suggesting that promotes the ubiquitination and subsequent destabilization of _PROTEIN_ and therefore increases _PROTEIN_ stability . furthermore disruption of the _PROTEIN_ interaction by application of _PROTEIN_ peptide resulted in increased stability of ha _PROTEIN_ and ha _PROTEIN_ proteins in a dosage dependent manner . in vivo experiment using arabidopsis seedlings _PROTEIN_ ha _PROTEIN_ protein also confirmed that _PROTEIN_ treatment enhances the steady state levels of _PROTEIN_ protein . because _PROTEIN_ treatment increased the steady state levels of ha _PROTEIN_ protein and inhibited the interaction of _PROTEIN_ and we conclude that acts a negative regulator of _PROTEIN_ protein stability . we next examined the interaction of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and proteins when plasmids _PROTEIN_ all proteins were introduced into arabidopsis protoplasts simultaneously . fixed amounts of ha _PROTEIN_ and ha _PROTEIN_ plasmid were cotransformed with increasing amounts of ha plasmid . the steady state level of ha _PROTEIN_ and ha _PROTEIN_ proteins displayed opposite responses to increasing ha _PROTEIN_ . as the level of increased the level of _PROTEIN_ declined and that of _PROTEIN_ increased consistent with the results when these proteins were examined individually . together these results suggest that has reciprocal effects on the stability of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ proteins . as our results indicated that regulated the stability of the _PROTEIN_ proteins we examined if altered levels of the _PROTEIN_ affected _PROTEIN_ protein levels and hence ethylene biosynthesis in planta . consistent with this there is a quantitative effect of disruption of the six copies of the _PROTEIN_ genes on ethylene production from etiolated and light grown arabidopsis seedlings . in order to test if elevated _PROTEIN_ can have the opposite effect from the loss of function mutations we used arabidopsis protoplasts and transgenic plants overexpressing _PROTEIN_ . in arabidopsis protoplasts increased _PROTEIN_ protein led to a _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ protein levels suggesting that the _PROTEIN_ level of _PROTEIN_ proteins could act as a regulatory input affecting _PROTEIN_ protein stability . consistent with this transgenic seedlings overexpressing ha _PROTEIN_ protein _PROTEIN_ exhibited reduced ethylene production compared with wild type seedlings in both dark and light grown seedlings . this is consistent with results in tomato in which overexpression of _PROTEIN_ suppressed auxin induced ethylene biosynthesis and in arabidopsis in which overexpression of _PROTEIN_ reduced cytokinin induced ethylene biosynthesis and suppressed the etiolated seedling phenotype of an _PROTEIN_ overexpressing transgenic line . consistent with acting to stabilize _PROTEIN_ proteins induced overexpression of from an estradiol inducible promoter enhanced ethylene production in light grown arabidopsis seedlings . together these results support the hypothesis that the levels of both _PROTEIN_ and regulate the stability of _PROTEIN_ proteins . we examined whether the effect of on _PROTEIN_ can be attributed solely to its alteration of _PROTEIN_ levels or if there is also an _PROTEIN_ independent effect of on _PROTEIN_ stability . to address this we examined the effect of disrupting interactions via _PROTEIN_ treatment on ethylene function in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ triple mutant in which all three _PROTEIN_ genes harbored t dna insertions . the three t dna insertions in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants all occur within exons and eliminate full length transcript and are thus likely null alleles . as shown previously _PROTEIN_ etiolated seedlings display a strong triple response . the _PROTEIN_ peptide but not the inactive _PROTEIN_ peptide caused a _PROTEIN_ in the triple response in this triple mutant as evidenced by the increased hypocotyl length . _PROTEIN_ did not affect the hypocotyl length of wild type seedlings grown in the presence of acc suggesting the effects of _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ etiolated seedlings were the result of an effect on _PROTEIN_ function . consistent with this the _PROTEIN_ mutant produced less ethylene in the presence of _PROTEIN_ peptide compared with seedlings grown in the presence of the _PROTEIN_ peptide . finally we examined the steady state level of myc _PROTEIN_ protein in transiently transformed _PROTEIN_ mutant protoplasts treated with increasing concentrations of _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ peptide . _PROTEIN_ but not _PROTEIN_ treatment caused a dose dependent reduction of _PROTEIN_ protein levels in _PROTEIN_ similar to the effect in wild type protoplasts though somewhat reduced in magnitude . together these results suggest that affects _PROTEIN_ protein stability in a manner that is partially independent of its effect on the _PROTEIN_ .
