the arabidopsis thaliana l. genome contains _LOCATION_ proteins belonging to the mitochondrial carrier family . two mitochondrial carrier family members here named _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ exhibit high structural similarities to the mitochondrial nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide carrier from bakers yeast . _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ restores mitochondrial nad transport activity in a yeast mutant lacking scndt . localization studies with green _METHOD_ protein fusion proteins provided evidence that _PROTEIN_ resides in chloroplasts whereas only _PROTEIN_ locates to mitochondria . heterologous _PROTEIN_ in escherichia coli followed by purification reconstitution in proteoliposomes and uptake experiments revealed that both carriers exhibit a submillimolar affinity for nad and transport this compound in a counter exchange mode . among various substrates adp and amp are the most efficient counter exchange substrates for nad . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ promoter gus plants demonstrate that both genes are strongly _PROTEIN_ in developing tissues and in particular in highly metabolically active cells . the presence of both carriers is discussed with respect to the subcellular localization of de novo nad biosynthesis in plants and with respect to both the nad dependent metabolic pathways and the redox balance of chloroplasts and mitochondria .
the arabidopsis genome harbors genes coding for mcf type carrier proteins . a detailed search for proteins in arabidopsis exhibiting structural homology to the ndt type carriers previously identified in bakers yeast revealed that two transporters show a substantial degree of similarity . _PROTEIN_ comprises amino acids in length leading to a calculated molecular _METHOD_ of kda . _PROTEIN_ exhibits similar and identical amino acids when compared with the nad carrier _PROTEIN_ form yeast . the isoform _PROTEIN_ comprises amino acids in length leading to a calculated molecular _METHOD_ of kda . _PROTEIN_ exhibits similar and identical amino acids when compared with . bioinformatics analysis revealed that the amino acid sequences of the two novel arabidopsis proteins show the _PROTEIN_ characteristics of all members of the mitochondrial carrier family namely a hydropathy profile of a six transmembrane protein _METHOD_ and the presence of a fold repeated mets domain representing mitochondrial energy transfer signatures . these signature motifs are also present in the two ndt homologues in bakers yeast . moreover the occurrence of ndt carriers is not limited to the dicotyledonous species a. thaliana as homologous proteins are also present in the monocotyledonous species oryza sativa . before the first predicted transmembrane domains both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ exhibited comparable short n terminal extensions . the n terminal extension of _PROTEIN_ is according to the prediction server proposed to represent a putative mitochondrial transit peptide whereas in the case of _PROTEIN_ a localization in the plant endomembrane system may be assumed . the c terminal extension of _PROTEIN_ is amino acids shorter than that of _PROTEIN_ . without considering these residues _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ share identical amino acids . reconstitution of recombinant proteins in proteoliposomes is a method frequently used to identify transport properties of uncharacterized carrier proteins . thus we _PROTEIN_ the open reading frames of _GENE_ and _GENE_ in e. coli _PROTEIN_ cells . the gene products of _GENE_ and _GENE_ accumulated as inclusion bodies and were purified by centrifugation and washing . the apparent molecular _METHOD_ of the purified proteins were about and kda for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in good agreement with their respective molecular _METHOD_ . the identities of both recombinant proteins were further confirmed by n terminal sequencing . the recombinant proteins were not detected in bacteria harvested immediately before induction of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ nor in cells harvested after induction but lacking the coding sequence in the corresponding _PROTEIN_ vector _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . in the search for potential substrates of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ we based our choice of metabolites on the _PROTEIN_ that these proteins are related to which has been demonstrated to be the nad transporter in mitochondria from bakers yeast . proteoliposomes reconstituted with recombinant _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ catalyzed an nad /nad homo exchange that was completely inhibited by a mixture of pyridoxal phosphate and bathophenanthroline . however they did not catalyze homo exchanges of pyruvate malate oxoglutarate glutamate or carnitine . importantly no nad /nad exchange activity was detected when _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ had been inactivated by boiling before incorporation into liposomes or when proteoliposomes were reconstituted with _PROTEIN_ solubilized protein from bacterial cells either lacking the _PROTEIN_ vector for _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ or harvested immediately before induction of _PROTEIN_ . the substrate specificities of reconstituted _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were examined in depth by measuring the rates of nad uptake into proteoliposomes that had been preloaded with various potential substrates . with both proteins nad exchanged not only with itself but also with some intraliposomal nad analogues and several nucleotides of the bases a g c u and t . in contrast the uptake of radioactively labeled nad was low in the presence of internal nad nadh and camp . both carriers accept fad and fmn as poor counter exchange substrates but pyrophosphate is solely used by _PROTEIN_ and not by _PROTEIN_ . negligible nad uptake rates were measured with internal nadp nadph nicotinamide nicotinic acid adenosine thiamine mono or diphosphate inorganic phosphate coenzyme a folate nacl and malate malonate citrate fumarate aspartate glutamate s adenosylmethionine lysine arginine and ornithine did not serve as suitable counter exchange substrates . among intraliposomal nucleotides adenine nucleotides were exchanged more effectively than those of the other bases . for each type of nucleotide nucleoside mono and diphosphates were more effective than nucleoside triphosphates especially in the case of _PROTEIN_ . it is worth mentioning that similar results were obtained by measuring the uptake of amp instead of nad under the same experimental conditions of fig . . the nad /nad exchange reactions catalyzed by reconstituted _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were inhibited strongly by pyridoxal phosphate bathophenanthroline and mercurials inhibitors of several mitochondrial carriers and partially by bromcresol purple and tannic acid as well as by n ethylmaleimide . in contrast little inhibition was observed with butylmalonate benzenetricarboxylate and bongkrekate . it is notable that _PROTEIN_ and cyano hydroxycinnamate at concentrations that completely inhibit the mitochondrial adp/atp and the pyruvate carrier respectively had a small effect on the activity of _PROTEIN_ and a slightly greater effect on the activity of _PROTEIN_ . the inhibitor sensitivity of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ therefore resembles that of but is not identical . in fig . a and b the nad transport kinetics are compared for proteoliposomes measured either as uniport or as exchange . the exchange reactions catalyzed by both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ followed first order kinetics isotopic equilibrium being approached exponentially . the rate constants and the initial rates of nad exchange deduced from the time courses were and and and mmol/min g protein for _PROTEIN_ and for _PROTEIN_ respectively . in contrast the uniport uptake of nad by both carriers was negligible . the uniport mode of transport was further investigated by measuring the efflux of nad or amp from proteoliposomes preloaded with these compounds . this experimental approach provides a more sensitive assay for unidirectional transport . with both reconstituted carriers _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ little efflux of nad or amp was observed in the absence of external substrate whereas substantial efflux occurred upon the addition of external nad or amp . both efflux processes i.e . those with and without external substrate were prevented completely by the presence of the inhibitors bathophenanthroline and pyridoxal phosphate . the kinetic constants of recombinant purified _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were determined from the initial transport rates at various external nad concentrations in the presence of a constant saturating internal nad concentration of mm . the half saturation constant and specific activity values for nad /nad exchange at were mm and mmol/min g protein for _PROTEIN_ and mm and mmol/min g protein for _PROTEIN_ respectively . the vmax of _PROTEIN_ was therefore fold greater than that of _PROTEIN_ and the km of _PROTEIN_ for external nad was nearly half that of _PROTEIN_ . several external substrates were competitive inhibitors of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ as they increased the apparent km without changing the vmax of the nad /nad exchange . these results demonstrate that _PROTEIN_ has a greater affinity than _PROTEIN_ for all nucleotides of the purine and pyrimidine bases investigated herein . the inhibition constants of amp and adp for both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were lower than those of the other purine and pyrimidine nucleotides . moreover the ki of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ for fmn and fad were lower than those expected on the basis of their modest ability to exchange with nad . the latter findings suggest that these flavin adenine dinucleotides either have a rather high affinity for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ although they are poorly transported or exert an inhibitory effect on these proteins at high concentrations . in addition in agreement with the results of table no inhibition was observed by the simultaneous addition of mm ctp utp ttp or pyrophosphate with the labeled substrate on the _PROTEIN_ reconstituted nad /nad exchange activity measured under the conditions described in table . the s. cerevisiae _PROTEIN_ strain lacks mitochondrial nad uptake capacity and showed a growth delay on nonfermentable substrates which was more pronounced in the synthetic minimal medium than in the yeast peptone medium . we therefore checked whether the introduction of each of the two arabidopsis genes _GENE_ _PROTEIN_ or _GENE_ _PROTEIN_ in s. cerevisiae double mutant strain reversed the growth defect . the cells transformed with the empty vector and grown on synthetic minimal medium supplemented with ethanol exhibited a lower exponential growth rate and a lower growth plateau at the stationary phase as compared with wild type cells transformed with the same empty vector . the growth parameters were completely recovered when the double mutant cells were transformed with the vector carrying the arabidopsis carrier _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ short . with full length _PROTEIN_ only a partial recovery of the growth rate and the doubling time of the yeast mutant were obtained . the different effect between the full length and truncated version of _PROTEIN_ is probably due to a toxic effect of the corresponding c terminal extension . this possibility is substantiated by the finding that cells transformed with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ did not grow on synthetic complete medium supplemented with _PROTEIN_ or galactose . subsequently we checked whether _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ short _PROTEIN_ was able to increase the mitochondrial nad content of the strain which is much lower than that of the wild type yeast strain . the mitochondrial nad content of the double mutant strain increased severalfold upon _PROTEIN_ of arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ short . taken together these results indicate that both arabidopsis carriers are able to complement the phenotype of the s. cerevisiae cells devoid of their nad mitochondrial transporters . to provide experimental evidence on the subcellular localization of both carrier proteins we generated corresponding _METHOD_ fusions and _PROTEIN_ these recombinant proteins in tobacco mesophyll protoplasts . the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein locates to the chloroplast _LOCATION_ . this interpretation is based on the observation that the large green fluorescing organelle is fully congruent with the red _METHOD_ of the chloroplasts and is further confirmed by the merge . in the case of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ the green _METHOD_ appears in organelles clearly smaller than the large red fluorescing chloroplasts . by use of further _METHOD_ fusion proteins we moreover excluded that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ resides in either _LOCATION_ vesicles or the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . to verify whether these small organelles represent either mitochondria or _LOCATION_ we additionally _PROTEIN_ a _METHOD_ derivate carrying the peroxisomal targeting signal skl _PROTEIN_ and used the mito tracker dye . a comparison between the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and the _METHOD_ skl _METHOD_ in _LOCATION_ shows that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ does not reside in _LOCATION_ . however _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ caused _METHOD_ and the mito tracker labeled organelles merged perfectly further underlining the mitochondrial localization of this carrier . to evaluate the _PROTEIN_ pattern of the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ genes we constructed corresponding promoter gus reporter plants . for each construct we generated independent transgenic lines representative data are shown in fig . l. _PROTEIN_ promoter gus activity is comparably high in young leaf mesophyll cells absent in developing siliques and seeds low in all flower tissues and high in root tips and at the branches of adventitious roots . _PROTEIN_ promoter gus activity is remarkably high in the rapidly developing young meristematic shoot area in vascular bundles from young and old leaves in developing siliques including the funiculi structures in _PROTEIN_ veins in developing pollen and in the central cylinder of arabidopsis roots .
arabidopsis plants were grown on soil in a greenhouse for a relatively short photoperiod under low light and at relative humidity . a short photoperiod and low light intensities are mandatory for large arabidopsis plants . multiple alignments of amino acid sequences from and and the plant homologues available at _PROTEIN_ were obtained using . the green _METHOD_ protein fusion constructs were prepared by amplification of the complete coding region of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ using forward primer _PROTEIN_ xbai cgttcagattctagagatgtccg _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and reverse primer _PROTEIN_ xhoi gagctttgctcgagaggtatatg _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ respectively . both primers included restriction sites for an in frame insertion into _METHOD_ . protoplasts were prepared from tobacco plants grown under sterile conditions as described previously . protoplasts were transformed with column purified plasmid dna . after or h of incubation in the dark at protoplasts were analyzed for green _METHOD_ using a zeiss axiovert _METHOD_ microscope _PROTEIN_ . _METHOD_ was excited at nm and emission was detected using a zeiss digital camera axiocam mrm equipped with a nm bandpass filter and a plan neofluar oil objective . for generation of promoter gus constructs the promoter regions of about bp of the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ genes were amplified by pcr from genomic dna and the obtained pcr products were subcloned in orientation into smai restricted pbsk . both pbsk constructs were restricted with hindiii and smai and the promoter inserts were further introduced in frame into the binary vector pgptv . for the _PROTEIN_ construct the following primers were used _PROTEIN_ and ggaggatgagaatcccgggacatctcttgg for the _PROTEIN_ construct primers gaatcgagtgaagctatttccataagc and _PROTEIN_ were used . the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ promoter gus plasmids were used for agrobacterium tumefaciens transformation . transformation of arabidopsis thaliana was conducted according to the floral dip method . seedlings or tissues from transgenic _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ promoter gus plants were collected in glass scintillation vials filled with ice cold acetone and incubated for min at room temperature . for histochemical localization of gus activity the plant material was infiltrated for min with mm bromo chloro indolyl _PROTEIN_ acid in staining buffer medium and subsequently stained according to a standard protocol . images were taken using a leica stereo microscope _METHOD_ equipped with a leica digital camera _PROTEIN_ c. the coding sequences of _GENE_ for _PROTEIN_ and _GENE_ for _PROTEIN_ were amplified by pcr from a. thaliana root cdna preparation . the oligonucleotide primers were synthesized corresponding to the extremities of the coding sequences with additional bamhi and hindiii _PROTEIN_ or ndei and ecori _PROTEIN_ restriction sites as linkers _PROTEIN_ and cgaaagcttttaaagtatagagctttgctcagaaggtatat _PROTEIN_ tgaggatcccatatgattgaacatgggaactctacc and cgagaattcttatttgcttccaagagggatatg . the amplified products were cloned into the escherichia coli prun _PROTEIN_ vector and transformed into e. coli cells . transformants were selected on yt plates containing ampicillin and screened by direct colony pcr . the sequences of inserts were verified . the _PROTEIN_ of recombinant proteins was carried out at in e. coli strain . control cultures with the empty vector were processed in parallel . inclusion bodies were purified on a sucrose density gradient and washed at first with te buffer then twice with a buffer containing triton x mm edta and mm _PROTEIN_ ph and finally with mm _PROTEIN_ ph . the proteins were solubilized in _PROTEIN_ . small residues were removed by centrifugation . proteins were separated by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and stained with _METHOD_ blue dye . the n termini were sequenced and the yield of purified proteins was estimated by laser densitometry of stained samples . the recombinant proteins in _PROTEIN_ were reconstituted into liposomes in the presence of substrates as described previously . external substrate was removed from proteoliposomes on sephadex g columns pre equilibrated with mm nacl and mm _PROTEIN_ at ph . the amount of protein incorporated into liposomes was measured as described previously . transport at was started by adding nad or amp to substrate loaded proteoliposomes and terminated after the desired time by the addition of mm pyridoxal phosphate and mm bathophenanthroline . in controls the inhibitors were added at the beginning together with the labeled substrate . entrapped radioactivity was quantified . the experimental values were corrected by subtracting control values . the initial transport rate was calculated from the radioactivity taken up by proteoliposomes in the linear range of substrate uptake . for efflux measurements proteoliposomes containing mm nad or amp were labeled with nad or amp by carrier mediated exchange equilibration . after min for _PROTEIN_ and min for _PROTEIN_ the external radioactivity was removed by passing the proteoliposomes through sephadex g columns . efflux was started by adding unlabeled external substrate or buffer a alone and terminated by the addition of the inhibitors indicated above . the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ short plasmids were constructed by cloning the coding sequences of both carriers into the yeast _PROTEIN_ vector under the control of the inducible _PROTEIN_ promoter . saccharomyces cerevisiae cells were transformed with the above plasmids and grown in liquid synthetic minimal medium or synthetic complete medium supplemented with ethanol and with auxotrophic nutrients . mitochondria were isolated as described previously from cells grown until an optical density of was reached and the intramitochondrial nad was assayed by a standardized method .
