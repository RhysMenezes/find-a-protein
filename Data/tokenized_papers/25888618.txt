mitochondria play an important role in _PROTEIN_ metabolic and energy homeostasis in the cell . in plants impairment in mitochondrial functions usually has detrimental effects on growth and development . to study genes that are important for plant growth we have isolated a collection of slow growth mutants in arabidopsis . one of the slo mutants has a significant reduction in mitochondrial complex i activity . the mutant has a four nucleotide deletion in _GENE_ that encodes a pentatricopeptide repeat _PROTEIN_ protein . the protein contains nine classic _PROTEIN_ domains belonging to the p subfamily . the small deletion in the mutant changes the reading frame and creates a premature stop codon in the first _PROTEIN_ domain . we demonstrated that the _METHOD_ is localized to the _LOCATION_ . further analysis of mitochondrial rna metabolism revealed that the mutant was defective in splicing of nadh dehydrogenase _PROTEIN_ intron . this specific splicing defect led to a dramatic reduction in complex i activity in the mutant as revealed by blue native gel analysis . complementation of by or _METHOD_ restored the splicing of _PROTEIN_ intron the complex i activity and the growth defects of the mutant . together these results indicate that the _PROTEIN_ protein is a splicing _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ intron in arabidopsis mitochondria .
to study genes that are important for plant growth we isolated several slo mutants from a collection of arabidopsis transfer dna insertion lines . one of the slo mutants has _PROTEIN_ germination retarded growth and delayed development phenotypes . when grown on tissue culture medium the root length of was significantly shorter than that of the wild type . the development of true leaves was also significantly delayed in compared with that of the wild type . when grown in soil for weeks the wild type arabidopsis plant was mature and well developed but the mutant was just about to bolt and most of the rosette leaves were curly . a mature mutant plant could grow to about two thirds of the height of the wild type and did not display obvious defects in flowers or siliques . however the seeds of the mutant were darker and shrunken compared with those of the wild type . we used the ethynyl deoxyuridine based proliferation assay to compare cell division in roots of d old wild type and seedlings . the modified nucleoside edu is incorporated during dna synthesis which provides a rapid and robust assay for detection of cell proliferation in plant tissues . during the period of edu labeling the primary root of the wild type has a lot more newly synthesized dna than that of . dna synthesis _PROTEIN_ occurred in the cell division zone close to the root tip . the edu assay revealed that the primary root of had fewer proliferating cells which would result in a slow growth phenotype of the mutant . genetic analysis of the mutant indicated that was a recessive mutant but its phenotype did not cosegregate with the t dna insertion . we thus made a cross between the mutant and landsberg _LOCATION_ and used map based cloning to identify the molecular lesion of . simple sequence length polymorphism analysis of mutant plants allowed us to assign the mutation to the vicinity of sslp marker on the bottom arm of chromosome . to facilitate the identification of the gene we sequenced the whole genome of and compared it with that of the reference genome . on the bottom arm of chromosome we found a four nucleotide deletion in the coding region of _GENE_ in the mutant . the deletion would change the reading frame of _GENE_ after the amino acid residue and produced a stop codon at the position of the residue in the mutant . reverse transcription pcr analysis revealed that steady state levels of mutant transcripts were comparable with those of the wild type . thus the four nucleotide deletion does not significantly affect the stability of the mutant transcripts . the gene encodes a _PROTEIN_ protein of amino acid residues . the _PROTEIN_ protein a member of the p subfamily contains nine _PROTEIN_ domains and a putative presequence for _LOCATION_ targeting . the premature stop codon derived from the mutant transcripts is located in the first _PROTEIN_ domain . a protein blast search revealed that homologs were found in _METHOD_ but not in _METHOD_ or nonvascular plants . alignment of homologs from arabidopsis populus trichocarpa solanum lycopersicum glycine max rice sorghum bicolor and maize revealed that these proteins were highly conserved between dicotyledon and monocotyledon plants . to further prove that the allele is responsible for the mutant phenotypes we constructed plant _PROTEIN_ vectors harboring or _METHOD_ cdnas . the constructs were transformed into plants to test if they could rescue the mutant phenotypes . when we screened seeds from both transgenic events on selective medium successful transformants had a growth phenotype similar to that of the wild type indicating that and _METHOD_ were able to rescue the mutant . both and _METHOD_ complementation lines were carried to homozygosity and used for further analysis . a representative complementation line complemented by is shown in figure . similarly the _METHOD_ transgene was able to restore the growth phenotype of to that of the wild type . together these results confirmed that the mutant is caused by a loss of function mutation in the _GENE_ gene . the _PROTEIN_ contains an amino terminal sequence to target the protein to mitochondria according to _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ which integrates multiple software predictions . the phenotypes of also implicated that the _PROTEIN_ could be localized to the _LOCATION_ . we showed that the _METHOD_ construct was able to complement the mutant indicating that the _METHOD_ fusion protein is functional in planta . confocal microscopy was used to observe the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ signals in the roots of these complemented plants . mitotracker orange was used to stain the roots as a control for mitochondrial localization . in the root hair of a _METHOD_ complemented line the green _METHOD_ signals colocalized with the mitotracker orange _METHOD_ signals . similar results were observed in root epidermal cells . although the targetp program predicts that the _PROTEIN_ protein is localized to the chloroplast or _LOCATION_ we could not observe the green _METHOD_ signals of the _METHOD_ in the chloroplast . these results suggest that the _METHOD_ fusion protein is localized to the _LOCATION_ and _PROTEIN_ is more accurate in the prediction of subcellular localization . it is well known that many plant _PROTEIN_ proteins are involved in chloroplast or mitochondrial rna metabolism . the phenotypes of the mutant and the subcellular localization of the _METHOD_ imply that the _PROTEIN_ protein may play a role in mitochondrial rna metabolism . to test this hypothesis we designed experiments to examine mitochondrial rna editing splicing and the abundance of mitochondrial transcripts in the mutant . we used rt pcr and bulk sequencing of the amplified cdnas to compare the editing efficiencies of mitochondrial transcripts in and the wild type . of the more than mitochondrial rna editing sites examined we did not observe any significant difference between and the wild type . for rna splicing analysis we used quantitative rt pcr assays to examine the ratio of spliced to unspliced rna for each mitochondrial intron in wild type and _METHOD_ complemented plants . of the introns examined the splicing efficiency of _PROTEIN_ intron was dramatically _PROTEIN_ in the mutant which was restored in the complemented plants . the quantitative rt pcr results also revealed that the reduced type ratio for _PROTEIN_ intron splicing was due to both an increase in unspliced and a _PROTEIN_ in spliced _PROTEIN_ transcripts in the mutant . compared with those of the wild type the splicing efficiencies of the other introns were not significantly affected in the mutant . we also used quantitative rt pcr assays to compare the abundance of mitochondrial transcripts in wild type and _METHOD_ complemented plants . separate primer sets designed to detect different transcription units of the trans splicing genes _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were included in the analysis . these assays covered protein coding and ribosomal rna genes of the arabidopsis mitochondrial genome . we did not detect significant transcript reduction in any of the mitochondrial genes examined that could potentially lead to reduced activities of respiratory complexes or other mitochondrial functions . by contrast significant increases in the accumulation of several mitochondrial transcripts were observed in the mutant as compared with wild type or complemented plants . it is likely that these are secondary effects caused by the loss of _PROTEIN_ intron splicing in . the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ gene contains four introns and the length of intron is bp . rt pcr analysis with primers that would amplify the bp full length _PROTEIN_ cdna in the wild type revealed that the majority of _PROTEIN_ transcripts in the mutant were about kb . sequencing analysis confirmed that the kb products were the unspliced form of the _PROTEIN_ transcript retaining the entire intron . by contrast fully processed _PROTEIN_ transcripts were the predominant _METHOD_ present in wild type and complemented plants . these results further confirmed that the splicing of _PROTEIN_ intron was severely impaired in the mutant . sequencing analysis of these rt pcr products also allowed us to compare the editing status of fully processed and intron containing _PROTEIN_ transcripts in the wild type and respectively . the editing of all sites located in the exons of _PROTEIN_ was not affected in the mutant . it has been shown that rna editing in trans introns is involved in the splicing reaction in wheat mitochondria . interestingly arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ intron contains an editing site near the junction of intron exon . although the _PROTEIN_ intron is not a trans intron it is still of interest to know if the status of this particular editing site is affected in the mutant . we used rt pcr to amplify the intron containing _PROTEIN_ transcripts in the wild type with primers located in exon and exon . bulk sequencing analysis of these unspliced transcripts revealed that the c to u editing of the _PROTEIN_ intron editing site was not affected in the mutant . thus the lack of _PROTEIN_ intron splicing was not due to the absence of an rna editing _PROTEIN_ rather than a splicing _PROTEIN_ in the mutant . in addition to _PROTEIN_ we used similar rt pcr assays with primers designed to detect fully processed or full length transcripts of other mitochondrial nad genes . the results indicated that the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ was not affected in the mutant . taken together these results suggest that the mutant has a specific defect in the splicing of _PROTEIN_ intron . it has been proposed that _PROTEIN_ proteins may recognize rna sequences via a one _PROTEIN_ motif one nucleotide module and the amino acids at particular positions in each repeat determine the nucleotide binding specificity . we used bioinformatics predictions based on a combinatorial amino acid code for rna recognition by _PROTEIN_ proteins to predict the _PROTEIN_ binding sites in _PROTEIN_ intron . we have identified four candidate rna sequences that _PROTEIN_ may bind in _PROTEIN_ intron . interestingly three of the four candidate sites are located in the vicinity of intron exon junctions . further experiments are required to test if the _PROTEIN_ protein can really bind to these candidate sequences . _PROTEIN_ is a subunit of the mitochondrial electron transport chain complex i . the splicing defect in _PROTEIN_ may directly affect the activity of complex i in the mutant . we used blue native _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and in gel activity staining to examine the activity of complex i in wild type and _METHOD_ complemented plants . compared with that of the wild type the activity of complex i was significantly reduced in the mutant . in complemented plants the complex i activity was restored to levels similar to those of the wild type . these results further confirmed that the primary defect in _PROTEIN_ intron splicing would result in dysfunctional mitochondria in the mutant .
