pectins are complex polysaccharides that form the gel _PROTEIN_ of the primary cell wall and are abundant in the middle lamella that holds plant cells together . their degree of methylesterification impacts wall strength and cell adhesion since unesterified pectin regions can cross link via ions to form stronger gels . here we characterize flying _PROTEIN_ a novel arabidopsis thaliana seed coat mutant which displays primary wall detachment reduced mucilage extrusion and increased mucilage adherence . these defects appear to result from a lower dm in mucilage and are enhanced by the addition of or completely rescued using alkaline chelators . _PROTEIN_ encodes a transmembrane protein with a _PROTEIN_ domain that has in vitro ubiquitin ligase activity . _PROTEIN_ is orthologous to transmembrane ubiquitin a _LOCATION_ localized ligase involved in the quality control of _LOCATION_ proteins in yeast . however _PROTEIN_ yellow _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ fusions are localized in punctae that are predominantly distinct from the _LOCATION_ and the trans _LOCATION_ network/early endosome in the seed coat epidermis . wortmannin treatment which induces the fusion of _PROTEIN_ endosomes in plants resulted in enlarged _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ bodies . we propose that _PROTEIN_ regulates the dm of pectin in mucilage potentially by recycling pectin methylesterase enzymes in the endomembrane system of seed coat epidermal cells .
the _PROTEIN_ mutant line was isolated by screening for seed mucilage defects in a columbia population mutagenized with ethyl methanesulfonate _METHOD_ . wild type extruded mucilage is not homogeneous but consists of an outer nonadherent layer that is easily removed by shaking in water and an inner adherent layer which remains attached to the seed even after prolonged shaking . mature wild type seeds shaken in water and stained with ruthenium red a pectin dye are surrounded by a pink gel like capsule . in contrast with the wild type hydrated _PROTEIN_ seeds appear to release smaller mucilage halos surrounded by a large number of darkly stained small discs . the difference between wild type and _PROTEIN_ mucilage halos is enhanced when dry seeds are hydrated directly in rr . the _PROTEIN_ discs appear at the periphery of the adherent mucilage layer and are not detached from the seed after h of shaking with an orbital rotator . this suggests that the discs are strongly bound to the adherent mucilage and may result from reduced mucilage extrusion in _PROTEIN_ compared with the wild type . although mucilage must be stained to be clearly observed the _PROTEIN_ discs are also visible without staining suggesting that they can not be composed solely of mucilage . mature seed coat epidermal cells contain three morphologically and chemically distinct cell walls . the _PROTEIN_ discs resemble the polygonal shape of the outer tangential primary walls which are normally attached to the columellae of hydrated seeds . we therefore examined the position of the outer primary walls in wild type and _PROTEIN_ seeds shaken in water . all wild type seed epidermal cells have primary walls attached to their columellae but many _PROTEIN_ cells display columellae with no attached walls . we further investigated the composition of the _PROTEIN_ discs using pontamine fast _PROTEIN_ which preferentially stains cellulose microfibrils . all wild type seed coat epidermal cells have stained primary wall fragments attached to their columellae consistent with the observations made using unstained seeds in water . although wild type and _PROTEIN_ have similar levels of diffuse labeling in the inner mucilage layers _PROTEIN_ seeds display many stained discs which are at the outer edge of the mucilage halo and are positioned above columellae that lack labeled primary wall attachment . the surface morphology of wild type and _PROTEIN_ dry seeds was examined by scanning electron microscopy _PROTEIN_ . wild type and _PROTEIN_ seed epidermal cells displayed outer tangential cell walls and columellae with similar shapes and sizes . to investigate the structure of extruded mucilage seeds hydrated in water were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and examined with cryo scanning electron microscopy . both wild type and _PROTEIN_ hydrated seeds display intricate mesh like networks of mucilage . however only the mutant seeds show electron dense discs on top of the extruded mucilage _PROTEIN_ consistent with position of rr stained discs at the edge of the _PROTEIN_ mucilage halo . since the outer primary cell walls viewed with _PROTEIN_ and the _PROTEIN_ discs observed with cryosem or rr staining resemble polygons we measured their diameters and compared them using student s t tests . the diameter of _PROTEIN_ outer tangential primary walls observed with _PROTEIN_ is similar to that of rr stained discs . the cryosem discs are similar to rr stained discs but significantly smaller than walls in _PROTEIN_ micrographs . analysis of hydrated seeds prior to and after staining revealed that _PROTEIN_ discs contain cellulose and are positioned above columellae lacking attached primary walls . the _PROTEIN_ discs in light and cryosem micrographs were similar in size to the primary walls of the seed coat epidermis visualized with _PROTEIN_ . overall the results in this section strongly support the hypothesis that the outer tangential primary cell walls of many _PROTEIN_ seed coat epidermal cells detach from columellae upon mucilage extrusion in water . to determine if the _PROTEIN_ mucilage extrusion defects result from abnormal seed coat differentiation fixed sections of developing seeds were analyzed using light microscopy . the development of _PROTEIN_ seed epidermal cells is indistinguishable from the wild type and mucilage biosynthesis appears unaffected unlike mutants that synthesize less pectin such as _PROTEIN_ . primary wall attachment to the columella appears identical to the wild type in live _PROTEIN_ seed coat epidermal cells at _PROTEIN_ . the unaltered development of _PROTEIN_ seed coat cells is consistent with the normal surface morphology of dry mature seeds . the monosaccharide composition of wild type and _PROTEIN_ whole seeds was determined using high performance anion exchange chromatography . the alcohol insoluble residues prepared from _PROTEIN_ and wild type seeds contained similar monosaccharide levels consistent with seed coat mutants that primarily affect pectin modification rather than pectin biosynthesis . overall the _PROTEIN_ seed development and the whole seed hpaec results suggest that _PROTEIN_ is not required for the biosynthesis of a major cell wall polysaccharide . we investigated if _PROTEIN_ affects mucilage extrusion and adhesion by analyzing the monosaccharide compositions of sequential mucilage extractions from wild type and _PROTEIN_ seeds . although _PROTEIN_ discs are not detached from the seed by gentle shaking vigorous agitation using a vortex mixer can remove the majority of polygonal discs and the adherent mucilage . therefore we extracted mucilage without discs by gently shaking seeds in water for h followed by mucilage including discs by vigorously shaking in water for an additional h. hpaec monosaccharide analysis of the first mucilage extraction showed a strong reduction of rha and gala in _PROTEIN_ mucilage relative to the wild type but the subsequent _PROTEIN_ mucilage extraction contained almost twice as much rha and gala compared with the wild type . all other monosaccharides detected are minor mucilage components but showed similar trends to rha and gala . in addition to the sequential extractions total mucilage amounts were extracted from water hydrated seeds by adding naoh to a final concentration m and vortex mixing for h. no rr stained mucilage remained around wild type and _PROTEIN_ seeds . wild type and _PROTEIN_ mucilage extracted by naoh have similar monosaccharide compositions . despite having whole seed and total mucilage monosaccharide compositions similar to the wild type _PROTEIN_ seeds display a reduced mucilage extractability in water . the _PROTEIN_ mucilage capsule is more adherent than the wild type since vigorous shaking in water partially compensates for the reduced monosaccharide levels in the first _PROTEIN_ water extraction . similar to the wild type _PROTEIN_ seeds release a mucilage halo within s of hydration in water . however _PROTEIN_ discs continue to be released after more than s suggesting that some _PROTEIN_ cells have delayed mucilage release . compared with the wild type _PROTEIN_ seeds have a more compact and adherent mucilage halo . to identify the cause of reduced mucilage expansion in the _PROTEIN_ mutant we examined the effects of hydrating seeds in a solution . ions are required for the formation of cross links between unesterified hg blocks and can therefore strengthen the pectin gel _PROTEIN_ . interestingly hydration of seeds directly in mm almost completely impairs mucilage extrusion from the _PROTEIN_ mutant but not from wild type seeds which show only a small reduction in mucilage halo size . this suggests that pectins in _PROTEIN_ mucilage can form more calcium cross links than in the wild type . although only a few treated _PROTEIN_ seed epidermal cells release mucilage all of these appear to have discs atop their compact mucilage columns . in stark contrast with the addition of ions cation chelators such as edta can disrupt cross links between unesterified hg chains and facilitate seed mucilage extrusion . hydration of mature seeds in mm edta ph completely rescued the _PROTEIN_ mucilage extrusion defect resulting in equally large wild type and _PROTEIN_ mucilage capsules without any visible discs . rr stained discs were not observed in edta hydrated _PROTEIN_ seeds indicating that edta may also rescue the primary wall detachment phenotype of this mutant . surprisingly unstained _PROTEIN_ seeds hydrated directly in edta look identical to wild type seeds and have primary cell wall fragments attached to all columellae . staining confirmed that the primary walls stay attached to columellae in _PROTEIN_ seeds hydrated with edta . since pectin is stabilized at acidic ph and can be degraded at alkaline ph we investigated if the suppression of the _PROTEIN_ mucilage defects is also ph dependent . the edta ph treatment largely rescued the _PROTEIN_ defects similar to edta ph . treatment with mm hepes buffer which does not bind partially rescued the _PROTEIN_ defects at ph but not at ph . seeds treated with both edta and hepes resembled the edta treated seeds . removal of by edta is largely sufficient to rescue the _PROTEIN_ mucilage defects but an alkaline ph also contributes to rescue the mutant phenotype . since the _PROTEIN_ defects are sensitive to the presence of ions _PROTEIN_ mucilage likely contains more unesterified gala than wild type mucilage . immunolabeling of mature seeds with three anti hg antibodies was conducted to determine if _PROTEIN_ mucilage displays an altered pattern of methylesterification . the same image acquisition settings were used within each immunolabeling experiment . an antibody that specifically binds unesterified blocks of hg cross linked by ions only labeled primary cell wall material in wild type seeds including the outer tangential walls attached to columellae and the radial walls . interestingly _PROTEIN_ seeds displayed signal in both the primary cell wall and in the extruded mucilage . the abundance of signal in _PROTEIN_ mucilage along its absence in wild type mucilage is consistent with increased amounts of unesterified hg in the mutant . two additional antibodies with broader specificities were also used to characterize the seed mucilage which binds to heavily methylesterified hg and which binds partially methylesterified hg . and recognize partially overlapping domains of seed mucilage and both labeled larger regions of _PROTEIN_ mucilage compared with the wild type . the results of all three antibodies are consistent with _PROTEIN_ mucilage containing more unesterified hg than the wild type . to exclude the possibility that increased immunolabeling of _PROTEIN_ mucilage results from higher epitope accessibility rather than larger amounts of unesterified hg the dm of mucilage and whole seeds was determined using biochemical assays . the dm was calculated as a percentage molar ratio of methanol released after cell wall saponification to uronic acids measured using the m hydroxydiphenyl assay . mucilage was extracted by vigorously shaking seeds in mm edta for h . whereas wild type and _PROTEIN_ whole seeds contain pectin with a similar dm _PROTEIN_ mucilage has a significantly lower dm than wild type mucilage . the lower dm in _PROTEIN_ mucilage corroborates the increased immunolabeling of unesterified hg and accounts for the strong effects of and edta treatments on _PROTEIN_ mucilage defects . since the altered dm appears to be the primary defect of _PROTEIN_ mucilage the detached discs may result from increased binding of mucilage to the primary wall . along with the normal dm and monosaccharide composition in _PROTEIN_ whole seeds these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ is required to establish the correct dm in seed mucilage . the _PROTEIN_ phenotype was shown to segregate as a single recessive _LOCATION_ mutation _PROTEIN_ . the position of the _PROTEIN_ mutation was mapped to a kb region containing genes near the end of chromosome iv . we screened nearly independent t dna insertions in of the candidate genes for mucilage defects . five lines _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ all contained mutations in _GENE_ and produced seeds that release compact mucilage halos and discs . pcr based segregation analysis using these five independent lines indicated that the t dna insertions were responsible for the _PROTEIN_ phenotype and were consistent with recessive loss of function mutations . the _GENE_ gene encodes a previously uncharacterized protein belonging to the really interesting new gene _PROTEIN_ finger superfamily . sequencing of _GENE_ in the _PROTEIN_ background revealed a g to a transition consistent with _METHOD_ mutation at bp that changes the amino acid trp to a stop codon . this early stop codon is predicted to truncate the peptide encoded by the _PROTEIN_ gene resulting in the loss of the conserved _PROTEIN_ domain . the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ alleles were characterized in greater detail and were shown to be indistinguishable from _PROTEIN_ with cryosem staining and anti hg immunolabeling . complementation tests between _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ failed to rescue the mucilage defects consistent with mutations occurring in the same gene . in addition we performed molecular complementation of _PROTEIN_ with a _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ construct containing wild type _GENE_ genomic dna _PROTEIN_ fused to citrine _METHOD_ in the pad vector . multiple independent _PROTEIN_ lines transformed with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ produced seeds that resemble the wild type but _PROTEIN_ plants transformed with empty pad vector produced seeds that still released many discs . consistent with the seed mucilage defects of the _PROTEIN_ mutant alleles the electronic _METHOD_ pictograph browser _METHOD_ revealed very high _PROTEIN_ transcript levels in seeds relative to other arabidopsis organs and preferential _PROTEIN_ in the seed coat compared with the endosperm and embryo . interestingly _PROTEIN_ has one paralog in arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ and at least one ortholog in fungi protists green algae mosses and other vascular plant species with a sequenced genome . _PROTEIN_ encodes a protein with amino acid identity to _PROTEIN_ . although _PROTEIN_ transcripts are less abundant than _PROTEIN_ in developing seeds _PROTEIN_ shows preferential _PROTEIN_ in the seed coat compared with other seed tissues . to investigate if _PROTEIN_ is also involved in mucilage biosynthesis we isolated homozygous _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ t dna lines . hydrated _PROTEIN_ seeds display wild type rr staining staining and and immunolabeling . the function of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ may not be limited to the seed coat since rt pcr analysis detected the highest transcript levels in _METHOD_ . according to multiple microarray data sets both genes are most strongly _PROTEIN_ in stem and root xylem cells suggesting that they may play a role in vasculature development . however neither _PROTEIN_ nor _PROTEIN_ mutants show any obvious defects in leaf stem or root morphology . in the genecat database _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are highly coexpressed with _PROTEIN_ like homeodomain _PROTEIN_ which encodes a transcription _PROTEIN_ shown to regulate cell wall biosynthesis in xylem and seed coat cells . although _PROTEIN_ mutants display an irregular xylem cell phenotype both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ xylem cells resembled the wild type . _PROTEIN_ contains an n terminal signal peptide that targets the protein to the endomembrane system and is predicted to be cleaved in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ between amino acids and . the consensus prediction of the _PROTEIN_ plant _LOCATION_ protein database is that _PROTEIN_ has seven transmembrane spanning helices . the c terminal end of the _PROTEIN_ protein contains a _PROTEIN_ finger which is conserved in all eukaryotes and coordinates two zinc ions . the predicted _PROTEIN_ topology of the _PROTEIN_ protein indicates that the c terminal _PROTEIN_ domain faces the _LOCATION_ . both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ have a _PROTEIN_ domain with a motif _PROTEIN_ based on the arrangement of the eight zinc binding cys and his residues . interestingly the ortholog of _PROTEIN_ in the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae is transmembrane ubiquitin a _LOCATION_ localized ligase that tags misfolded _LOCATION_ proteins with ubiquitin for transport to endosomes and degradation in the _LOCATION_ . has a c terminal _PROTEIN_ domain similar to _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ along with an n terminal signal peptide and seven helices . to determine if _PROTEIN_ functions as an ligase we conducted an in vitro ubiquitination assay . ubiquitination results from the sequential action of a ubiquitin activating enzyme a ubiquitin conjugating enzyme and a ubiquitin ligase and can regulate a protein s stability activity or location . since recombinant _PROTEIN_ and purification of transmembrane proteins is _PROTEIN_ we _PROTEIN_ only the soluble c terminus of _PROTEIN_ containing the _PROTEIN_ domain fused to glutathione s transferase _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . the complete in vitro ubiquitination assay contained ubiquitin and three recombinant arabidopsis proteins enzyme _PROTEIN_ enzyme _PROTEIN_ and enzyme _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . the polyubiquitin smear detected by immunoblot analysis using an antiubiquitin antibody in the complete assay demonstrates that the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ domain is capable of mediating polyubiquitination . omission of the enzyme the ligase or the ubiquitin components abolished formation of polyubiquitinated species as expected . the ubiquitin ligase activity of _PROTEIN_ and the lower pectin dm of _PROTEIN_ mucilage suggest that _PROTEIN_ may positively regulate pmts or negatively regulate pmes . while putative pmts are _LOCATION_ bound most pmes are soluble or have a signal peptide that is cleaved in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and therefore do not have _LOCATION_ lys residues which can be ubiquitinated . thus we investigated if pmes coexpressed with _PROTEIN_ have _LOCATION_ domains and putative ubiquitination sites . and _PROTEIN_ are preferentially _PROTEIN_ in the seed coat and are coexpressed with _PROTEIN_ in genecat and _PROTEIN_ ii databases . unlike most pmes and _PROTEIN_ are predicted to have an internal helix near the n terminus and at least one _LOCATION_ lys residue . the _PROTEIN_ and subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ was analyzed using the previously described _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ construct that complements the _PROTEIN_ mutation . we used identical image acquisition settings for the different tissues and developmental stages presented within each figure . multiple independent plants containing the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgene displayed strong _METHOD_ _METHOD_ in the seed coat epidermis . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ begins at _PROTEIN_ is highest at _PROTEIN_ when mucilage synthesis and secretion is at its peak and _PROTEIN_ by _PROTEIN_ at the start of columella deposition . no _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signal was observed in dissected embryos at _PROTEIN_ or in tissues more suitable for cell imaging such as leaves and roots . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion proteins primarily localize in a small number of intracellular punctae in seed coat epidermal cells and are not observed in the mucilage pocket or in the primary cell wall . at _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ also appears in several larger compartments . since is known to be _LOCATION_ localized we compared the localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ with the distribution of the _LOCATION_ marker sialyltransferase _PROTEIN_ tagged with red _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ labels a large number of intracellular punctae which are in close proximity to _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ bodies and partially overlap with a few of them . surprisingly however the majority of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ compartments do not colocalize with the _LOCATION_ marker _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ at either or _PROTEIN_ . we also analyzed the subcellular localization of the trans _LOCATION_ network/early endosome marker _METHOD_ which is distinct from the _LOCATION_ marker _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . although a few _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ punctae partially colocalize with _METHOD_ in seed coat epidermal cells at and _PROTEIN_ the localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ is largely distinct from that of the tgn/ee . the _METHOD_ markers tested were excluded from seed coat mucilage pockets and the amyloplasts . we were unable to stain seeds _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ with the endocytic tracer due to a lack of dye uptake by developing seed coat cells . seed epidermal cells pretreated with _METHOD_ to increase permeability were also not affected by brefeldin a a drug commonly used in secretion and endocytosis studies . however _PROTEIN_ seed coat epidermal cells treated with wortmannin a drug that induces the fusion of _PROTEIN_ endosomes/multivesicular bodies/prevacuolar compartments in plants showed a greater number of large _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ bodies than control seeds . wortmannin treatment increased the ratio of large to small _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ bodies from to in one biological replicate and from to in a second biological replicate .
