cell division is a fundamental biological process sharing conserved features and controls in all eukaryotes . the cell cycle is usually divided into four phases _PROTEIN_ s _PROTEIN_ and m. regulated gene _PROTEIN_ is an important mechanism for controlling cell cycle progression and genes involved in cell division related processes often show transcriptional regulation dependent on cell cycle position . in the present report a novel cell cycle related gene from arabidopsis thaliana was isolated and characterized . sequence analysis revealed that the deduced amino acid sequence of atcpr showed identity with a mouse _PROTEIN_ to s cell cycle specifically modulated and proliferation associated _LOCATION_ protein . assay of _PROTEIN_ of atcpr in partially synchronized cells suggested that atcpr mrna was _PROTEIN_ in the _PROTEIN_ to s phase . in the atcpr transgenic plants no apparent phenotypic change was observed . by fusing a _METHOD_ tag to the atcpr protein it was found that atcpr was _PROTEIN_ located in the _LOCATION_ . however atcpr does not have any transcriptional activation ability . cdna microarray analysis showed that a total of and genes were identified as up regulated and down regulated respectively .
to identify putative regulatory molecules involved in the salt stress response in higher plants a bp cdna fragment encoding the conserved dna binding domain of was used as a probe to screen a cdna library constructed from the salt treated halophyte atriplex hortensis . besides a cdna encoding a dre binding protein another cdna of kb was also isolated under the same low stringency condition . database blast analysis identified several homologous cdna sequences showing to amino acid identity to this kb sequence from species as diverse as yeast human c. elegans fly mouse and plants . the homologous gene from yeast s. pombe encoded a protein that preferentially bound to a synthetic curved dna sequence . the homologous gene from mouse encoded a cell cycle specifically modified and proliferation associated _LOCATION_ protein _METHOD_ . the gene from human defined a protein highly homologous to the mouse cell cycle protein with identity at the amino acid level . therefore the kb gene from atriplex hortensis was designated as cell proliferation related gene . in order to understand the function of this kind of gene in plants homologous genes from the model plant arabidopsis were isolated using the rt pcr method designated as atcpr and studied further . the atcpr was bp in length with an open reading frame of bp flanked by bp untranslated region and bp utr . the orf encoded a putative protein of amino acids with a calculated molecular _METHOD_ of kda . computational analysis predicted a putative _LOCATION_ localization signal between amino acid and . alignment of the cdna and genomic dna sequences revealed that the atcpr gene consisted of exons and introns . database searches and southern analysis revealed that atcpr was a single copy gene and located on chromosome iii . the amino acid sequence of the atcpr was further analysed using the prosite _METHOD_ . fourteen putative phosphorylation sites for the casein kinase ii four phosphorylation sites for the protein kinase c one camp and cgmp dependent protein kinase phosphorylation site and one tyrosine kinase phosphorylation site were identified . two n glycosylation sites three amidation site _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and one n myristoylation site were also identified . in addition to these sites with a high probability of occurrence the prosite analysis also revealed other domains in the atcpr . a fibronectin type iii domain with a low confidence level was recognized . fibronectin is a dimeric glycoprotein involved in cell adhesion cell morphology thrombosis cell migration and embryonic differentiation . several portions of the atcpr also showed similarity to the peptidase . moreover the amino acid sequence from to also showed homology to the winged helix dna binding domain . whether these various domains have any functions remains to be investigated . organ specific _PROTEIN_ pattern of atcpr was examined using rna isolated from the flowered wild type plants . the results showed that the atcpr mrna accumulated in an organ specific manner with the strongest _PROTEIN_ in roots and flowers comparatively lower _PROTEIN_ in _METHOD_ and siliques and hardly detectable _PROTEIN_ in mature leaves . atcpr was also strongly _PROTEIN_ in callus . many abiotic stress responsive genes have been studied in this laboratory . it was interesting to know whether the atcpr gene was responsive to different abiotic stresses . the d old arabidopsis seedlings were subjected to cold nacl and peg treatments and _PROTEIN_ of the atcpr gene was examined . it was found that the transcription level of the atcpr gene did not change significantly indicating that the _PROTEIN_ of atcpr was not influenced by these treatments . the deduced amino acid sequence of atcpr protein contained the kkkkgggkkkk motif characterized by a core peptide enriched in lysine which was the potential _LOCATION_ localization signal . in order to know the subcellular distribution of atcpr in plant cells a construct habouring a fusion gene for the atcpr and green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ fusion protein was introduced into arabidopsis by a vacuum infiltration method . the transgenic plants were selected on _METHOD_ media containing kanamycin and _METHOD_ specific _METHOD_ was visualized under a confocal microscope . the result showed that the atcpr _METHOD_ fusion protein was detected in the guard cells especially in the area of _LOCATION_ of the guard cells whereas the _METHOD_ control protein was _PROTEIN_ localized in the cytoplasm as well as in the _LOCATION_ of the guard cells . this result indicated that the atcpr was _PROTEIN_ a _LOCATION_ protein . in other cell types the atcpr _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was not consistently or clearly observed probably due to the instability of the atcpr _METHOD_ proteins in these cells . alternatively the observed transgenic plants may be not at the stage when the fusion protein was highly _PROTEIN_ . because atcpr was _PROTEIN_ localized in the _LOCATION_ and with the identification of a putative dna binding domain the atcpr may function as a transcription _PROTEIN_ . it was further examined to see if atcpr possessed any transcriptional activation ability . a yeast system was used to test whether an activation domain was present in atcpr . the fusion plasmids pbd atcpr and pbd atcpr n were transformed into the yeast strain yrg containing a reporter gene plus upstream activating sequences . the uas can regulate the _PROTEIN_ of the reporter gene . if the reporter gene is activated the yeast harbouring the plasmid can grow on the medium without histidine indicating that there is a transcriptional activation domain in the atcpr . as seen in fig . all the transformants containing the plasmid pbd vector pbd atcpr and pbd atcpr n grew well on the yapd medium . whereas on sd his medium only the yeast cells harbouring the positive control plasmid were able to survive . the yeast cells containing the other three plasmids did not grow in the same medium . these results indicated that the pbd atcpr and pbd atcpr n fusion protein did not bind to uas of the reporter gene and could not activate its _PROTEIN_ . therefore the atcpr protein did not have the transcriptional activation ability . the identified homologous gene of mouse encoded a cell cycle specifically modified and proliferation associated _LOCATION_ protein . in order to investigate the possibility that atcpr _PROTEIN_ is regulated during the cell cycle synchronized arabidopsis cell suspensions were used for analysis because synchronized cells were powerful and effective tools for identifying the _PROTEIN_ timing and activity of candidate cell cycle related genes and thereby for inferring potential roles in cell cycle progression _PROTEIN_ . arabidopsis suspension cultures were established using callus generated from the root explants of d old seedlings . sucrose starvation combined with cycloheximide treatment which caused cell cycle arrest at _PROTEIN_ were used to achieve synchronization . rt pcr was performed to analyse the _PROTEIN_ of four cell cycle marker genes and the atcpr gene . the result is shown in fig . . the cdka gene _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ which encodes an archetypal cdk containing the pstaire sequence and is the cdk partner of d type cyclins is constantly _PROTEIN_ in synchronized culture cells . by contrast _PROTEIN_ of with the variant _PROTEIN_ motif increased gradually and reached a peak at h after treatment and then declined after h. the constitutive _PROTEIN_ gene from arabidopsis was used as a control that was not regulated by the cell cycle . the histone gene whose mrna accumulation was induced in parallel to dna synthesis at the _PROTEIN_ transition was strongly _PROTEIN_ before h and declined after that . the mrna level of the d type cyclin _PROTEIN_ was low after the treatments and then increased within h. the transcript of atcpr increased steadily between h and h reached a peak at h and then _PROTEIN_ . this result showed that _PROTEIN_ of atcpr was regulated during the cell cycle and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in the _PROTEIN_ to s phase . to characterize the function of atcpr in planta the atcpr gene in the sense orientation was inserted into the binary vector pbi under the control of the camv promoter and transferred into arabidopsis by vacuum infiltration . sixteen sense transgenic lines were obtained after selection on kanamycin media and homozygous plants were used for phenotype examination . however when grown either on vertical agar plates or in soil none of the independent transgenic lines showed a meiotically stable abnormal phenotype compared with wild type plants grown under identical conditions . to investigate whether atcpr can regulate the _PROTEIN_ of other genes micrroarray analysis was performed using rna isolated from the sense transgenic line and wild type plants . at least two independent rna preparations for each sample were made and used for probe synthesis . generation of the k array _METHOD_ labelling of probes hybridization and scanning were performed by deng 's laboratory . the hybridization signals from each of the replicates were averaged and used for analysis . by using fold change of gene _PROTEIN_ as a threshold a total of and genes were identified as up regulated and down regulated respectively . these genes were classified into different functional groups . among the up regulated genes two cell cycle related genes were found . encoded a putative protein showing similarity to a cell proliferation related protein from mus musculus . the cdna under the accession number encoded a cell cycle related protein _PROTEIN_ showing sequence similarity with the tobacco phi gene . these two genes were further examined by rna gel blot analysis to evaluate the validity of the _PROTEIN_ profile obtained from cdna microarray analysis . as shown in fig . when _PROTEIN_ of atcpr was high in the overexpressing transgenic lines and _PROTEIN_ of both and _PROTEIN_ were high . however in a line that did not show higher _PROTEIN_ of atcpr both and _PROTEIN_ genes were _PROTEIN_ at a low level . this result showed that the _PROTEIN_ data obtained by rna gel blot analysis were consistent with those obtained by microarray analysis and also indicated that and _PROTEIN_ genes may be the downstream genes of atcpr .
