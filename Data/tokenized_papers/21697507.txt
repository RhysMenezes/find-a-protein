the assembly sorting signals and turnover of the tonoplast potassium channel _PROTEIN_ of arabidopsis were studied . we used transgenic arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ a _PROTEIN_ green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ fusion or protoplasts transiently transformed with chimeric constructs based on domain exchange between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ the only tpk family member not located at the tonoplast . the results show that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ is a dimer and that the newly synthesized polypeptides transiently interact with a thus far unidentified kd polypeptide . a subset of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ chimeras were unable to assemble correctly and these remained located in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ where they interacted with the binding protein chaperone . therefore _PROTEIN_ must assemble correctly to pass _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ quality control . substitution of the _LOCATION_ c terminus of _PROTEIN_ with the corresponding domain of _PROTEIN_ was sufficient to allow tonoplast delivery indicating that this domain contains tonoplast sorting information . pulse chase labeling indicated that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ has a half life of at least h. turnover of the fusion protein involves internalization into the _LOCATION_ where the _METHOD_ domain is released . this indicates a possible mechanism for the turnover of tonoplast proteins .
_PROTEIN_ has been localized at the tonoplast when _PROTEIN_ transiently or in transgenic tobacco cells . we first wanted to confirm this localization in transgenic arabidopsis . endogenous _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ is rather low in general and very low in tissues other than leaves . we reasoned that _PROTEIN_ under endogenous promoter would have made detection of the recombinant protein very difficult . as the addition of a _METHOD_ tag at the c terminus does not modify the tonoplast localization of _PROTEIN_ in tobacco cells we generated transgenic arabidopsis plants constitutively _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus promoter . these plants do not have any evident phenotype alteration when grown in normal conditions . to verify whether _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was correctly synthesized we first analyzed total leaf protein extracts by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and protein blot using anti _METHOD_ antiserum . two closely migrating polypeptides with apparent molecular _METHOD_ around kd and one around kd were specifically recognized in the transgenic plants . this pattern was consistently produced in independent transgenic lines . plants from the same transformation event showed variable extents of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ accumulation but in plants the level was constant . the two larger polypeptides around kd most probably correspond to full length _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ as its predicted molecular _METHOD_ is kd . the close migration of the two bands suggests that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ can have two different conformations or undergo covalent modifications . _PROTEIN_ contains one potential n glycosylation site _PROTEIN_ . however _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ is not n glycosylated . the difference between the two closely related polypeptides must therefore have another explanation . the kd polypeptide is clearly detectable only in plants that have high accumulation of the kd _METHOD_ and may correspond to a degradation product containing the _METHOD_ epitopes recognized by the antibody . its apparent molecular _METHOD_ resembles that of _METHOD_ indicating that this _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fragment contains most of the _METHOD_ sequence . for brevity hereon this polypeptide will be referred to as free _METHOD_ . the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was determined in leaf epidermal cells and root tissues by _METHOD_ microscopy . in both cases _METHOD_ was at the tonoplast . no signal was detected at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ or other endomembranes . to further verify this result microsomes were prepared from leaf homogenates and fractionated by isopycnic ultracentrifugation on continuous suc gradient . intact _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ cofractionated with the tonoplast marker _PROTEIN_ but not with the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ intrinsic _PROTEIN_ or the _LOCATION_ chaperone endoplasmin . it can be concluded that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ is located at the tonoplast in transgenic arabidopsis plants and that _PROTEIN_ under the promoter does not lead to saturation of its sorting machinery . the assembly state of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was analyzed by velocity suc gradient centrifugations of leaf homogenates prepared in the presence of nonionic detergent . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ sedimented slightly slower than the kd standard indicating an apparent molecular _METHOD_ consistent with a dimer of the kd polypeptide . free _METHOD_ originating from _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ migrated between the and kd markers indicating that it is monomeric and thus strongly suggesting that it does not contribute to dimerization when it is part of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . the intersubunit interactions of the viral k channel kcv are disrupted in the presence of high concentration of sodium ions . we analyzed the assembly of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in the presence of mm na instead of mm k or as a control after denaturation with _PROTEIN_ . the sedimentation of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was not affected by the high sodium conditions . on the opposite _PROTEIN_ denatured _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ migrated as a monomer between the and kd markers . treatment with _PROTEIN_ did not cause any general protein migration artifact since the _PROTEIN_ denatured protein standards sedimented according to the molecular _METHOD_ of their monomeric _METHOD_ . similarly the migration of free _METHOD_ was not affected by high sodium or _PROTEIN_ . we conclude that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ is a homodimer and that its assembly is not disrupted by high sodium concentration . we investigated the dynamics of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ dimer formation by pulse chase analysis . attempts to use intact transgenic plantlets were unsuccessful because incorporation of radioactive amino acids into _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ continued during the chase indicating slow uptake and depletion . pulse chase was therefore performed on protoplasts isolated from transgenic leaves . protoplasts were subjected to min pulse or to h pulse followed by h chase . protoplast homogenates were then analyzed by velocity gradient centrifugation followed by immunoprecipitation of each fraction with anti _METHOD_ antiserum _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and radiography scanning . after the min pulse no _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ peak was detectable in the gradient region between the and kd markers where monomers are expected to migrate . newly synthesized _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was however in a complex of about kd slightly larger than the one detectable at steady state by protein blot . after h chase radioactive _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ had shifted to lighter fractions indicating that the expected dimers had been formed . at h chase free _METHOD_ becomes also clearly detectable as radioactive monomers indicating that _METHOD_ release is a posttranslational event occurring in vivo and it is not due to in vitro proteolytic degradation . the time dependent shift of intact _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ is accounted for by the coimmunoselection of a radioactive polypeptide of about kd after the short pulse but not after the chase . this unidentified polypeptide comigrated along the gradient with full length _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and was therefore transiently associated with it . coselection of the kd component with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was also clearly detectable when immunoprecipitation was performed on unfractionated protoplast homogenates after pulse labeling and gradually _PROTEIN_ during the chase . the component was not selected at _PROTEIN_ chase points or from labeled wild type protoplasts . therefore it is not an unspecific contaminant of immunoprecipitation but rather a protein that transiently interacts with newly synthesized _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . a simple explanation of these results is that at min pulse newly synthesized _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ is already assembled into dimers that form a transient complex with the kd polypeptide . as there is no information about the stoichiometry of the complex it can not be ruled out that this is instead composed of a single not yet assembled _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ subunit and several copies of the kd polypeptide . to identify sorting signals present in _PROTEIN_ we exchanged various domains between _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ the only member of the tpk family not located at the tonoplast . we performed transient _PROTEIN_ in protoplasts isolated from arabidopsis cell culture and analyzed the samples by confocal microscopy h after transfection . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was located at the tonoplast and occasionally in internal bulbs but never at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ identified by staining . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was mostly in not well defined internal _LOCATION_ but not at the tonoplast . its frequent perinuclear distribution indicated at least partial retention in the _LOCATION_ but the overall pattern was not typical of this compartment perhaps suggesting a distortion of internal endomembranes . staining indicated that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ delivery to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ is very inefficient in arabidopsis protoplasts . when apparent overlapping of the two signals was observed this was in patches and never along an entire protoplast . the overall pattern is similar to those observed when _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ constructs were transiently _PROTEIN_ in onion epidermis or nicotiana benthamiana mesophyll cells . to further verify the efficiency of traffic in our _PROTEIN_ system we transformed protoplasts with a _METHOD_ fusion of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ ammonium transporter _PROTEIN_ . this chimeric construct was efficiently delivered to its correct destination indicating that the peculiar distribution of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ is not due to a general inefficiency of traffic to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . the relative contribution of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ domains to each of the _PROTEIN_ chimeras is illustrated in the cartoons at top of figure . all the resulting chimeras contained _METHOD_ at their c terminus but the _METHOD_ acronym is omitted for brevity . the amino acid sequences are reported in supplemental figure . while this project was undergoing results obtained by an almost identical approach were reported using transient _PROTEIN_ in onion epidermal cells and localization of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ chimeras by confocal microscopy . for this reason we will underline here only some aspects of our results . _PROTEIN_ located at the tonoplast _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ whereas _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ did not show any tonoplast labeling and were _PROTEIN_ located in typical reticular structures indicating _LOCATION_ retention . these subcellular localizations are similar to those of the roughly corresponding constructs studied by citation . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was present in most protoplasts in extended _LOCATION_ . this pattern was similar to that of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ but _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ could also be detected at the tonoplast . the reticular _LOCATION_ was labeled in only a minor percentage of protoplasts . the similar construct _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in citation gave an _LOCATION_ pattern . finally _PROTEIN_ similar to the _LOCATION_ located _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in citation clearly exited the _LOCATION_ almost no protoplasts exhibited the _METHOD_ signal in this compartment . more interestingly the signal was in most cases observed at the tonoplast although the fusion is _PROTEIN_ based on _PROTEIN_ backbone . minor proportions were located in bulbs or in dots possibly corresponding to the _LOCATION_ complex . this indicates that the _PROTEIN_ c terminal _LOCATION_ domain is sufficient to sort _PROTEIN_ to the tonoplast of arabidopsis protoplasts . as also suggested by citation the _LOCATION_ localization of a number of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ exchange chimeras could be due to conformational defects rather than to the lack of signals for _LOCATION_ exit or tonoplast sorting . assembly state and possible interactions with the _LOCATION_ machinery were therefore analyzed . velocity gradient centrifugation of the tonoplast located constructs _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ indicated correct assembly into dimers _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . conversely the two _LOCATION_ retained constructs _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ formed complexes that migrated either faster or markedly slower than the kd marker . in fully independent experiments the _LOCATION_ retained fusion constructs never formed a single well defined peak and showed variable distribution along the gradient indicating disordered interactions and suggesting aggregation . proteins with defective folding or assembly can be found in abnormally extensive association with the _LOCATION_ chaperone binding protein a major component of the _LOCATION_ quality control mechanism . we therefore analyzed whether bip associates with any of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ chimeras . transfected protoplasts or untransfected control were pulse labeled for h. proteins were immunoprecipitated from cell homogenates with anti _METHOD_ antiserum and analyzed by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and radiography scanning . no radioactive polypeptide was immunoprecipitated from control protoplasts . as expected newly synthesized _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ migrated as a doublet around kd . the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ chimeras had variable banding patterns in the same molecular _METHOD_ region . the level of _PROTEIN_ was also variable although the higher intensity of the bands representing _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ could in part be ascribed to the _PROTEIN_ that each of them migrated as a single band unlike _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ . it therefore appears that the synthesis of two different _METHOD_ requires the n terminal domain of _PROTEIN_ possibly because the unknown modification occurs within this domain . several additional faintly labeled polypeptides were coimmunoselected together with the different constructs most of them being equally present in all samples . however two closely migrating polypeptides of about to kd were exclusively coselected with the _LOCATION_ retained constructs . they were not coselected with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ with the similarly traffic competent _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ or with _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ that was also transiently _PROTEIN_ as a further control _METHOD_ . immunoselection of control protoplasts using antiserum against bip strongly suggested that at least one of the two bands represents the chaperone . like all chaperones of the heat shock protein family bip is an _PROTEIN_ and can be released from its ligands by treatment with _PROTEIN_ . in vitro treatment with _PROTEIN_ fully released the two closely migrating to kd polypeptides from the anti _METHOD_ immunoprecipitate of protoplasts _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . when the supernatant released by _PROTEIN_ treatment was immunoprecipitated with anti bip antiserum the larger of the to kd polypeptides was selected confirming that it is bip and demonstrating that it specifically binds to the potassium channel chimeras due to its chaperone activity . the detectable interaction of bip with the two _LOCATION_ retained _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ chimeras but not with those sorted to the tonoplast confirmed that the former have conformational defects and are retained in the _LOCATION_ by quality control . the turnover mechanism of tonoplast proteins has not yet been specifically investigated . the long term destiny of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was therefore studied by pulse chase of protoplasts isolated from leaves of transgenic arabidopsis . no radioactive polypeptide was immunoprecipitated from wild type protoplasts used as a control . radioactive intact _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ synthesized during h pulse slowly _PROTEIN_ in amount during the chase to reach about of the original signal after h . this time dependent decline is better appreciated when the gel is exposed for a short time . free _METHOD_ became detectable only during the chase as already shown in figure . its intensity increased with time in parallel with the _PROTEIN_ of radioactive intact _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . since we have no tools to follow the destiny of _PROTEIN_ after _METHOD_ release it can be concluded that _PROTEIN_ half life is of at least h. although chase in intact tissue is inefficient not allowing an accurate measure of turnover rates when pulse chase was performed on young transgenic plantlets free _METHOD_ was first detectable at h chase suggesting that the turnover rate is not influenced by protoplast isolation . establishing the subcellular compartment where free _METHOD_ is located could provide information on the turnover mechanism of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . traffic of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusions from the _LOCATION_ can be prevented by brefeldin a in transiently transfected onion epidermal cells and in our transgenic plants . when transgenic leaves were incubated for h in the presence of the drug the release of free _METHOD_ from _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was fully inhibited . thus the proteolytic event requires traffic and possibly occurs in the _LOCATION_ . both intact _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and free _METHOD_ were detected by protein blot in _LOCATION_ isolated from mesophyll protoplasts . analysis of the same preparations with anti bip antiserum showed that the ratio between intact _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and bip was greatly reversed when the protoplast and _LOCATION_ preparations were compared indicating only minor contamination of _LOCATION_ by the _LOCATION_ which is the most abundant endomembrane . free _METHOD_ was absent from a leaf microsomal preparation confirming that it is a soluble polypeptide and that its presence in the isolated _LOCATION_ can not be due to contamination by other compartments . finally when protoplasts were subjected to pulse chase followed by _LOCATION_ isolation radioactive free _METHOD_ immunoprecipitated at h chase was quantitatively recovered with _LOCATION_ and more importantly the ratio between free _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was higher in the _LOCATION_ sample compared to the total protoplast sample . this is in agreement with a scenario in which free _METHOD_ would be totally _LOCATION_ and newly synthesized intact _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ would also be in part in other compartments en route to its tonoplast destination . free _METHOD_ released posttranslationally from _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ is therefore located in _LOCATION_ . however _METHOD_ was fused at the c terminus of _PROTEIN_ which is predicted to be _LOCATION_ . isolated _LOCATION_ were thus subjected to in vitro digestion with proteinase k to test the predicted orientation of the _METHOD_ tag . intact _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was fully digested by proteinase k in the presence of nonionic detergent leading to a marked increase in the amount of free _METHOD_ . in the absence of detergent proteinase k released _METHOD_ from most _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ molecules indicating that the c terminal domain has the expected _LOCATION_ topology . however a small proportion of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ polypeptides remained intact indicating that they are located inside the _LOCATION_ lumen where the cleavage of _METHOD_ from _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ eventually occurs in vivo . we often detected internal _LOCATION_ structures labeled by _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . these are very similar to the _LOCATION_ bulbs described by citation and could represent the first step of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ internalization from the tonoplast en route to its physiological turnover . as described delivery of _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ proteins to the _LOCATION_ for degradation is signaled by ubiquitination . we tested whether ubiquitinated _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ could be detected by antiubiquitin antibodies or by _METHOD_ _METHOD_ analysis of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ tryptic peptides . the results indicate that monoubiquitination is not the basis of the difference in molecular _METHOD_ between the two _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ but suggest that a minor proportion of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ molecules below the detection limit of our _METHOD_ _METHOD_ assay may be ubiquitinated probably en route to degradation .
