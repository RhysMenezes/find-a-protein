ser/arg _PROTEIN_ rich proteins are important splicing _PROTEIN_ in both general and alternative splicing . by binding to specific sequences on pre mrna and interacting with other splicing _PROTEIN_ via their rs domain they mediate different intraspliceosomal contacts thereby helping in splice site selection and spliceosome assembly . while characterizing new members of this protein family in arabidopsis we have identified two proteins termed and consisting of an n terminal peptidyl prolyl cis/trans isomerase domain and a c terminal domain with many _PROTEIN_ dipeptides . cyclophilins possess a peptidyl prolyl cis/trans isomerase activity and are implicated in protein folding assembly and transport . interacts in vivo and in vitro with a subset of arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ proteins including _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ two homologs of mammalian known to be important for splice site recognition . in addition both cyclophilins interact with and which in turn are binding partners of _PROTEIN_ . is a nucleoplasmic protein but in most cells _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion it was also found in one to six round _LOCATION_ bodies . however co _PROTEIN_ of with its binding partners resulted in re localization of from the _LOCATION_ bodies to _LOCATION_ speckles indicating functional interactions . these findings together with the observation that binding of _PROTEIN_ to is phosphorylation dependent indicate an involvement of in _LOCATION_ pre mrna splicing possibly by regulating phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of _PROTEIN_ proteins and other spliceosomal components . alternatively binding of to proteins important for splice site recognition suggests its involvement in the dynamics of spliceosome assembly .
cloning and sequence analysis of arabidopsis cyclophilins and a new group of _PROTEIN_ rich splicing _PROTEIN_ called scl proteins has been described in arabidopsis . to get more insight into their function we have performed yeast two hybrid screenings with each member of this group of proteins . in addition to known arabidopsis splicing _PROTEIN_ screens with _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ resulted in isolation of two partial cdna clones encoding a protein containing numerous serine arginine/serine proline _PROTEIN_ dipeptides . in addition partial cdnas encoding the same protein were isolated in a yeast two hybrid screen with _PROTEIN_ an arabidopsis homolog of the human . cloning of the full length cdna revealed that it encodes a protein of amino acids consisting of an n terminal _PROTEIN_ domain followed by a region highly enriched in lysines arginines and serines and a c terminal half of the protein enriched in _PROTEIN_ dipeptides . we named this protein . in addition to the full length cdna an alternatively spliced form encoding a putative protein lacking rs/sp domain has been identified in the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ sequence tag data base . the arabidopsis genome encodes an additional protein with the same domain organization as and cloning of the full length cdna revealed that it encodes a protein of amino acids termed accordingly . and show high sequence similarity in the _PROTEIN_ domain . the rest of the sequence is similar only in _METHOD_ of being highly charged enriched in serine residues and having many _PROTEIN_ dipeptides . data base searches with and revealed high sequence similarity with the human protein _PROTEIN_ its rat ortholog _PROTEIN_ and drosophila moca cyp which was isolated as an interacting partner of the transcriptional regulator . sequence similarity between metazoan and arabidopsis proteins is particularly high in the _PROTEIN_ domain with identity and similarity . interacts with arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ proteins and with the snrnp specific proteins and all clones isolated in yeast two hybrid screenings with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ proteins encoded only the rs/sp domain of the protein we tested whether the full length is also capable of interacting with _PROTEIN_ proteins in a yeast two hybrid assay . co _PROTEIN_ of dna binding domain fusion with _PROTEIN_ proteins fused to activation domain resulted in activation of both his and galactosidase reporter genes . this confirmed the original two hybrid interactions and showed that the full length interacts with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . in a direct two hybrid assay we found that interacts with _PROTEIN_ another arabidopsis homolog of human and with _PROTEIN_ protein specific kinase _PROTEIN_ . an additional yeast two hybrid screen with as a bait resulted in isolation of two partial cdna clones encoding the c terminal halves of the arabidopsis snrnp specific protein and snrnp specific protein the same clones were found to interact with . to test whether is also capable of interacting with arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ proteins in vivo full length cdna encoding was cloned into a yeast two hybrid vector fused to the dna binding domain . the resulting plasmid was co transformed into a yeast reporter strain with constructs _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and fused to the activation domain . all combinations resulted in efficient growth on medium lacking histidine and in activation of the galactosidase reporter gene indicating that all tested proteins interact with . to confirm the two hybrid results interactions between the proteins were also studied by in vitro pull down assays . was overexpressed in escherichia coli as _PROTEIN_ fusion bound onto glutathione sepharose beads and incubated with protein extracts from yeast cells _PROTEIN_ ha tagged _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . western analysis of proteins retained on the beads with anti ha antibody revealed that interacts with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . pull down experiments with _PROTEIN_ or beads alone did not show any interactions with the proteins studied . interactions between and and were also analyzed by in vitro pull down assays by using full length ha tagged and proteins _PROTEIN_ in plant protoplasts . as shown in fig . both proteins interacted efficiently with thereby confirming the yeast two hybrid results . because we were unable to _PROTEIN_ in e. coli interactions of with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and were not analyzed by pull down assay . based on the two hybrid and pull down results we conclude that and interact with _PROTEIN_ proteins and with the snrnp specific proteins and from arabidopsis suggesting their involvement in pre mrna processing . in hela _LOCATION_ extracts protein interacts with _PROTEIN_ proteins and this interaction is important for recruitment of snrnp to the splice site . therefore we asked whether and _PROTEIN_ interact in plant cells too . immunoprecipitations with protein extracts prepared from tobacco protoplasts co transformed with plasmids _PROTEIN_ fused to ha tag and _PROTEIN_ fused to _METHOD_ revealed efficient co precipitation of the two proteins . because protein was proposed to function as an analog of in splicing of minor introns we also found efficient co precipitation of and _PROTEIN_ . this together with binding of to _PROTEIN_ and indicates that interactions of and with _PROTEIN_ proteins could be regulated by . is a _LOCATION_ interacts with _PROTEIN_ proteins and snrnp specific proteins we were interested in its subcellular localization . to address this question we used the _METHOD_ tagging approach . in transiently transformed tobacco leaf or arabidopsis cell suspension protoplasts the _METHOD_ fusion was found in the _LOCATION_ in a diffuse pattern throughout the nucleoplasm but excluded from nucleoli . additionally in of transformed cells _METHOD_ was found concentrated in one to six round dots resembling cajal bodies . however co localization studies with a protein marker for cbs in plant cells and _PROTEIN_ a protein component of the small nucleolar ribonucleoprotein particles which localize in cbs and nucleolus revealed that these dots are not cbs . rs/sp and krs domains of are required for interaction with _PROTEIN_ and snrnp specific proteins and for correct _LOCATION_ localization of consists of three distinct structural domains . because all two hybrid positive clones encoded the rs/sp domain we asked whether this is the only domain involved in protein protein interaction . to this end five deletion mutants of fused to _PROTEIN_ were constructed and _PROTEIN_ in e. coli . pull down experiments revealed that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ require both the rs/sp and krs domains for efficient binding as equally efficient binding was observed with the full length and . in addition each of these two domains alone _PROTEIN_ is able to bind _PROTEIN_ proteins with comparable efficiencies indicating that the overall strength of binding is the sum provided by these two domains . simultaneous deletion of rs/sp and krs domains _PROTEIN_ abolished binding to all _PROTEIN_ proteins although weak binding to _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ was detected in some experiments indicating that the _PROTEIN_ domain alone does not contribute significantly to protein protein interaction with _PROTEIN_ proteins . this is further supported by results obtained with _PROTEIN_ which bound all _PROTEIN_ proteins with approximately the same efficiency as _PROTEIN_ and . this together with the yeast two hybrid data demonstrates that the protein protein interactions of with _PROTEIN_ proteins are mediated by the rs/sp and krs domains . similar results have been obtained with the and proteins although binding to both _PROTEIN_ and was weaker compared with _PROTEIN_ proteins . we also determined the sequence requirements for localization of in the _LOCATION_ by constructing five deletion mutants depicted in fig . fused to _METHOD_ . confocal microscopy analyses of transformed protoplasts revealed that the _PROTEIN_ domain alone is not able to efficiently target the _METHOD_ fusion protein to the _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ and that it is not required for localization of the protein in _LOCATION_ bodies as the mutant lacking _PROTEIN_ domain was found like the full length diffusely distributed in the nucleoplasm and in _LOCATION_ bodies _METHOD_ . deletion of the _PROTEIN_ and krs domains resulted in localization of the fusion protein in a diffuse/speckled pattern in the nucleoplasm . deletion mutant lacking rs/sp domain _PROTEIN_ showed diffuse nucleoplasmic and nucleolar staining _PROTEIN_ . some cells also showed localization in _LOCATION_ bodies _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . _PROTEIN_ of the krs domain alone _PROTEIN_ resulted in a diffuse _LOCATION_ localization of the fusion protein which was like _PROTEIN_ also found in nucleoli . finally deletion of both rs/sp and krs domains _PROTEIN_ resulted in cytoplasmic and _LOCATION_ localization of the fusion protein . nucleolar localization of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ was confirmed by co transformation with the nucleolar marker _PROTEIN_ fused to _METHOD_ . as shown in fig . both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ localized to nucleoli as evident from the appearance of the yellow color due to co localization with _PROTEIN_ whereas and which were not seen in nucleoli did not show any co localization with _PROTEIN_ . in summary localization of in _LOCATION_ bodies requires both rs/sp and krs domains although each of these two domains alone is sufficient to efficiently target the _METHOD_ fusion protein to the _LOCATION_ . re localizes from _LOCATION_ bodies into speckles upon co _PROTEIN_ with its interacting accordance with their function in pre mrna splicing _PROTEIN_ proteins are known as _LOCATION_ proteins localized in speckles and this is true for plant _PROTEIN_ proteins as well . the different subnuclear localization of and its interacting partners raised the question of how they interact in vivo in plant cells . to address these issue tobacco protoplasts were co transformed with plasmids _PROTEIN_ fused to _METHOD_ and its interacting partners fused to _METHOD_ . co transformation of with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and showed co localization of _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ signals and interestingly resulted in re localization of from _LOCATION_ bodies into speckles . in some cells however prominent _LOCATION_ bodies have been observed in which only was found _PROTEIN_ . this was particularly evident in cells co transformed with . co _PROTEIN_ of and _PROTEIN_ an arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ protein which was not found to interact with did not result in re localization of either or _PROTEIN_ . in addition a nucleolar rna helicase _PROTEIN_ also did not relocalize upon co _PROTEIN_ with . taken together our co localization studies indicate that re localization of upon co _PROTEIN_ with its interacting partners is due to a functional interaction in vivo and not due to changes of _LOCATION_ or chromatin organization . consistent with this are our observations that only those _METHOD_ tagged deletion mutants of containing rs/sp domain co localized with its interacting partners . this is in line with the original two hybrid data and in vitro interaction data with deletion mutants thus confirming that the interaction between the proteins is _PROTEIN_ mediated by the rs/sp domain of . phosphorylation status of _PROTEIN_ influences its interaction with proteins are phosphorylated in their rs domains and the phosphorylation status of _PROTEIN_ proteins influences their interaction with other splicing _PROTEIN_ distribution within the _LOCATION_ and recruitment to transcription initiation sites . therefore we asked whether phosphorylation of _PROTEIN_ proteins influences their interaction with . to address this question protein extracts prepared from plant protoplasts _PROTEIN_ ha tagged _PROTEIN_ proteins were dephosphorylated with cip for h at room temperature and then used for pull down assay with _PROTEIN_ . control extracts were kept at room temperature without phosphatase treatment . fig . demonstrates that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are strongly phosphorylated when transiently _PROTEIN_ in plant protoplasts . in contrast protein and did not change their mobility on _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ upon phosphatase treatment . pull down experiments revealed that dephosphorylation of _PROTEIN_ significantly reduced binding to _PROTEIN_ whereas _PROTEIN_ and as well as _PROTEIN_ and did not show this phosphorylation dependence . in addition western analysis of supernatants after incubation with _PROTEIN_ revealed that phosphorylated _PROTEIN_ is quantitatively depleted from the extract whereas the dephosphorylated form is readily detectable . to substantiate these data we performed dephosphorylation of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ with increasing amounts of cip . pull downs with corresponding extracts clearly show that increasing dephosphorylation of _PROTEIN_ but not of _PROTEIN_ strongly reduces its binding to _PROTEIN_ thereby confirming that phosphorylation of _PROTEIN_ is required for efficient binding to .
