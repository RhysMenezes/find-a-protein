the phosphorylation of proteins by protein kinases controls many cellular and physiological processes which include intracellular signal transduction . however the underlying molecular _METHOD_ of such controls and numerous substrates of protein kinases remain to be characterized . the mitogen activated protein kinase cascade is of particular importance in a variety of _LOCATION_ and intracellular signaling processes . in plant cells the progression of cytokinesis is an excellent example of an intracellular phenomenon that requires the mapk cascade . however the way in which mapks control downstream processes during cytokinesis in plant cells remains to be fully determined . we show here that comparisons by two dimensional difference gel electrophoresis of phosphorylated proteins from wild type arabidopsis thaliana and mutant plants defective in a mapk cascade allow identification of substrates of a specific mapk . using this method we identified the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ protein which has a _PROTEIN_ domain as a substrate of _PROTEIN_ map kinase . _PROTEIN_ was concentrated at the cell division plane as is _PROTEIN_ and had binding affinity for phosphoinositides . this binding affinity was altered after phosphorylation of _PROTEIN_ by _PROTEIN_ suggesting a role for the mapk cascade in the formation of cell plates via regeneration of _LOCATION_ during cytokinesis .
to identify substrates of _PROTEIN_ in vivo we used dige to compare phosphorylated proteins from the wild type with those from mutants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ that were defective in the nack pqr pathway . proteins extracted from tissue of the wild type and these mutant plants were subjected to further treatment to concentrate the phosphorylated proteins as described in the materials and methods . analysis by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ of the resultant phosphorylated protein fractions confirmed significant enrichment for these proteins . phosphorylated proteins from wild type and mutant plants were covalently labeled with different respective fluorophores . then the labeled proteins from the two sources were combined and the proteins were subjected to dige . after separation of the combined proteins by _PROTEIN_ phosphoproteins derived from wild type plants were visualized as green spots while those derived from the mutants were red and both images were merged . if in a particular spot the amount of a certain phosphorylated protein from the wild type was present at the same level as that from the mutant the spot appeared yellow . a spot with a lower amount of a particular phosphorylated protein from the mutant plant as compared with that from the wild type plant should appear greener . almost all spots containing proteins from wild type and _PROTEIN_ plants were yellow indicating that these spots contained similar amounts of the respective phosphorylated proteins derived from both wild type and _PROTEIN_ plants . however there were several green spots which appeared to represent candidate targets of _PROTEIN_ . we performed similar analyses with _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutant plants and again we observed several distinct green spots in each case . several contiguous spots were always green in all images obtained from the analysis of the three different mutants suggesting that proteins in these spots were likely targets of phosphorylation in the nack pqr pathway . to identitfy the candidate proteins we cut out portions of the above mentioned gels that contained the spots of interest and digested the proteins in the gel with trypsin . the _METHOD_ of each peptide was determined by _PROTEIN_ assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and the _METHOD_ spectra obtained were used to identify the corresponding proteins by peptide _METHOD_ fingerprinting . several contiguous spots in a pattern that we observed on all our dige gels corresponded to the protein _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ which is a plant _PROTEIN_ like protein . the sequence coverage of authentic _PROTEIN_ by the peptides in the present study was . this low coverage might have been due to the acidic region in the n terminal half of the amino acid sequence of authentic _PROTEIN_ . the majority of the peptides identified by maldi _METHOD_ originated from the c terminal half of _PROTEIN_ . the calculated molecular _METHOD_ and pi of _PROTEIN_ are kda and respectively . fig . of _PROTEIN_ by maldi _METHOD_ . the predicted amino acid sequence of _PROTEIN_ from a. thaliana . the peptide fragments detected by maldi _METHOD_ in the

arrowhead and inset are shown similarly to those in . we carried out dige analysis of phosphorylated proteins extracted from wild type and _PROTEIN_ mutant plants . using antibodies specific for the the synthetic peptide of _PROTEIN_ western blot analysis of protein extracts prepared from plants with three different _PROTEIN_ alleles including _PROTEIN_ showed that these mutants did not produce a protein that corresponded in _METHOD_ of molecular _METHOD_ to _PROTEIN_ . after dige analysis with the _PROTEIN_ mutant the spots that we had identified putatively as _PROTEIN_ again exhibited a green color as shown in b confirming that proteins recognized as green spots in corresponded to _PROTEIN_ derived proteins . _PROTEIN_ is the closest protein to _PROTEIN_ in the proteome of a. thaliana and both contain the _PROTEIN_ domain which is ubiquitously conserved throughout the eukaryotic kingdom and has the ability to bind and transfer phospholipids . within the _PROTEIN_ domains of these _PROTEIN_ proteins of amino acid residues are identical . we compared the levels of _PROTEIN_ in mutants with defects in genes for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in the nack pqr pathway with the levels in the wild type siblings . protein bands corresponding to levels of _PROTEIN_ in these mutants were of similar intensity indicating that the mutations in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ genes did not affect the amount of _PROTEIN_ protein produced . we also measured levels of _PROTEIN_ mrna by real time reverse transcription pcr . there were no significant differences among the mutants and the wild type siblings . our results indicated that defects in genes for components of the nack pqr pathway reduced the relative amount of the phosphorylated form of _PROTEIN_ protein in the mutant lines . fig . of the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ . total protein extracted from wild type and mutant siblings was subjected to _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and the _PROTEIN_ protein was detected with _PROTEIN_ specific antibodies . the _LOCATION_ was stained with _METHOD_ brilliant blue . note that the relative molecular _METHOD_ of the detected band was larger than the estimated size of kda maybe because of the presence of many acidic amino acid residues in the n terminal half . results of analysis by real time rt pcr of transcripts of the _PROTEIN_ gene in wild type and mutant siblings . levels of _PROTEIN_ transcripts were used as a reference and relative values refer to ratios calculated by dividing the level of _PROTEIN_ in mutants by that in the wild type . the values shown represent averages sd of measurements of four independent experiments in each case . the value was normalized by reference to that for _PROTEIN_ transcripts . analysis of the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ .

experiments in each case . the value was normalized by reference to that for _PROTEIN_ transcripts . to examine the phosphorylation of _PROTEIN_ in vivo we fractionated proteins by gel electrophoresis with subsequent immunoblotting with _PROTEIN_ specific antibodies . we incubated extracts of total protein from roots of wild type plants with and without lambda protein phosphatase _PROTEIN_ and then subjected the extracts to gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting . we observed three spots designated and and determined the intensity of each spot . after treatment with _PROTEIN_ the relative intensities of spots and were reduced while that of spot increased . these results imply that _PROTEIN_ might be phosphorylated in vivo that the protein corresponding to spot might contain no phosphate groups and that proteins in spots and might contain one and/or increasing numbers of phosphate groups . fig . western blotting for identification of phosphorylation of _PROTEIN_ in vivo . total proteins extracted from wild type plants were separated by gel electrophoresis and the _PROTEIN_ was detected with _PROTEIN_ specific antibodies . the results of densitometric analysis are shown in the right hand panel . phosphatase treated proteins were subjected to western blotting . total protein from a wild type plant was mixed with mbp _PROTEIN_ protein which had been generated in e. coli and was used as a marker for positioning on _LOCATION_ and the mixture was subjected to western blotting . _PROTEIN_ was visualized as described above . spots of mbp _PROTEIN_ are indicated by arrowheads and the regions into which its degradation products have spread are indicated by an arc with an asterisk . total proteins from an _PROTEIN_ mutant plant were subjected similarly to western

have spread are indicated by an arc with an asterisk . total proteins from an _PROTEIN_ mutant plant were subjected similarly to western blotting and _PROTEIN_ was visualized as described above . we analyzed similarly the phosphorylation status of endogenous _PROTEIN_ in tissue of wild type and _PROTEIN_ mutant plants by western blotting . in the analysis of the wild type plant the intensity of spot was the highest among those of spots of phosphorylated _PROTEIN_ . however the relative intensity of spot was highest in the case of the _PROTEIN_ mutant . these results suggested that the relative amount of the non phosphorylated form of _PROTEIN_ was higher in the _PROTEIN_ mutant than in the wild type and that _PROTEIN_ was responsible for phosphorylation of some part of the phosphorylation . we examined the phosphorylation of _PROTEIN_ by _PROTEIN_ in vitro using glutathione s transferase fused _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and histidine and tagged _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ that had been produced in escherichia coli . _PROTEIN_ map kinase was activated by active mapkk . _PROTEIN_ phosphorylated _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . we identified six putative sites of phosphorylation of _PROTEIN_ by _PROTEIN_ each of which is followed by the proline residue . we introduced mutations that replaced these serine and threonine residues with alanine residues . we first generated a pair of mutants in which one member contained three alanine replacements at the serine residues _PROTEIN_ and the other contained three alanine replacements at the threonine residues _PROTEIN_ . we examined whether the two mutant proteins could be phosphorylated by _PROTEIN_ in vitro . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was only very weakly phosphorylated by _PROTEIN_ suggesting that the three serine residues of _PROTEIN_ include a major site of phosphorylation by _PROTEIN_ . in contrast _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was efficiently phosphorylated by _PROTEIN_ and the replacements of the threonine residues by alanine had no effect on the extent of phosphorylation . next we replaced each of the three individual serine residues separately with alanine and repeated the kinase assays . the extent of phosphorylation by _PROTEIN_ was significantly reduced in the mutant protein with replacement of serine by alanine at position _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . thus the serine residue at position of _PROTEIN_ appeared to be the major site of phosphorylation by _PROTEIN_ . fig . of _PROTEIN_ by _PROTEIN_ in vitro . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was incubated with or without _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in the presence of _PROTEIN_ . after _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ phosphorylated _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was detected by autoradiography . arrowheads indicate the positions of the three proteins . note that the relative molecular _METHOD_ of the

replacement of a serine residue at the indicated position by an alanine residue . images after autoradiography and staining with _METHOD_ brilliant blue are shown . we examined the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ by _PROTEIN_ the recombinant gene for _PROTEIN_ green _METHOD_ protein fused _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in root cells of transgenic plants of a. thaliana under the control of the promoter of cauliflower mosaic virus _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . we monitored the _METHOD_ of _METHOD_ in root tissue by confocal laser scanning microscopy . we detected _METHOD_ due to _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ at the cell periphery which suggested the presence of _PROTEIN_ at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ or at the cell wall at the cell boundary . however _METHOD_ due to _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was not uniformly distributed to all cell boundaries in the division zone signals from the apical and basal planes of cell division were much stronger than those from the _PROTEIN_ boundaries . moreover some apical and basal planes were associated with stronger signals than others as indicated by the arrow in b . stronger signals were typically found on the apical or basal planes of relatively small cells suggesting that these planes had been newly synthesized in association with cell division . signals due to _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were also evident at the pre mature cell plate which appeared to be expanding during cytokinesis . these images suggested that _PROTEIN_ might be concentrated at the cell plate during the progression of cytokinesis and temporarily retained at the division plane even after the maturation of cell plates . the patterns that we observed were similar to those of _PROTEIN_ as revealed previously by immunostaining . we also _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ with the mutation in plants of a. thaliana but found no obvious differences in _METHOD_ of the pattern of subcellular localization from the pattern described above . in addition we also detected intense signals due to _METHOD_ over the entire cell periphery in the _PROTEIN_ root cap and on all division planes of cells in the central cylinder above the quiescent center . fig .

protein fused _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ separately into tobacco by cells . most of the _METHOD_ signals due to _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ were observed at the cell boundaries and at the cell plate while _METHOD_ due to _METHOD_ alone was distributed over the entire cytoplasm and _LOCATION_ with the exception of _LOCATION_ . examination of plasmolyzed cells revealed that signals due to _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ were concentrated at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ as opposed to the cell wall . _METHOD_ staining of mts confirmed that _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was concentrated at the equatorial plane of phragmoplasts between sets of separating daughter chromosomes during cytokinesis . fig . localization of _PROTEIN_ in tobacco by cells . tobacco by cells _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . the developing

. we examined the localization of _METHOD_ signals due to both _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ fused _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ during cytokinesis in living by cells by time lapse imaging . we transformed by cells with dna constructs for these fusion proteins and synchronized the cell cycle of the transformed cells at prometaphase by two step synchronization with aphidicolin and propyzamide as described in the materials and methods . during culturing of the cells after removal of promyzamide signals due to the two _METHOD_ proteins were almost co localized during the progression of cytokinesis . the respective intensities of the signals due to the two fluorochromes at the cell plate appeared to be similar at and min . differences in the patterns of signals due to _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ became apparent at min the signal due to _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was distributed uniformly over the cell plate at min while the signal due to _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was more intense at the periphery of the cell plate than in the internal region an observation consistent with the previous result . these observations supported our hypothesis that _PROTEIN_ is temporarily retained at the division plane after the maturation of the cell plate . we examined the ability of recombinant _PROTEIN_ to bind phosphoinositides by a protein lipid overlay assay . maltose binding protein fused _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ that had been synthesized in e. coli was purified and tested for binding to various phosphoinositides that had been immobilized onto nitrocellulose _LOCATION_ . the mbp _PROTEIN_ that had bound to phosphoinositides was visualized by immunostaining with _PROTEIN_ specific antibodies . although mbp _PROTEIN_ did not bind to phosphatidylinositol _PROTEIN_ it bound to all seven phosphorylated _METHOD_ of _PROTEIN_ phosphatidylinositol monophosphates _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ phosphatidylinositol bisphosphates _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and phosphatidylinositol triphosphate _PROTEIN_ . the binding affinity for _PROTEIN_ was higher than that for _PROTEIN_ which was higher than that for _PROTEIN_ . fig . binding properties of _PROTEIN_ and

_PROTEIN_ by _PROTEIN_ and the labeled protein was subjected to the protein lipid overlay assay as described in the materials and methods . radioactivity was detected by autoradiography . the intensities of radioactive spots were determined as described above . the percentage of the intensity in each spot was calculated against the total radioactivity of all spots . values are the means sd of four replicate experiments . phosphoinositide binding properties of _PROTEIN_ and phosphorylated _PROTEIN_ . relative binding activity of _PROTEIN_ . mbp _PROTEIN_ was subjected to the protein

the materials and methods . radioactivity was detected by autoradiography . the intensities of radioactive spots were determined as described above . the percentage of the intensity in each spot was calculated against the total radioactivity of all spots . values are the means sd of four replicate experiments . we examined whether phosphorylation of _PROTEIN_ by _PROTEIN_ might have an effect on the binding activity of _PROTEIN_ to phosphoinositides since the mutated residue at position was located near the _PROTEIN_ lipid binding domain . mbp _PROTEIN_ was phosphorylated by _PROTEIN_ in vitro with _PROTEIN_ and subjected to protein lipid overlay assays . mbp _PROTEIN_ that bound to phosphoinositides was visualized by autoradiography . as shown in b the binding patterns of phosphorylated _PROTEIN_ to phosphoinositides were altered by the phosphorylation the affinity of phosphorylated _PROTEIN_ for _PROTEIN_ was relatively reduced . in contrast the affinity of phosphorylated _PROTEIN_ for _PROTEIN_ and that for _PROTEIN_ were relatively increased . these results suggest that phosphorylation by _PROTEIN_ altered the binding activity of _PROTEIN_ depending on the extent of phosphorylation of phosphoinositides .
the protocol for the phenol extraction of proteins was a modified version of that described elsewhere _PROTEIN_ . the roots of day old wild type and mutant plants of a. thaliana grown on vertical plates were ground in liquid nitrogen with a pestle and mortar . each resultant powder was suspended in vols . of extraction buffer _METHOD_ and then an identical volume of tris saturated phenol was added with vigorous mixing . the solution was centrifuged and the phenol phase was collected . after the addition of extraction buffer and centrifugation the proteins in the phenol phase were precipitated with vols . of methanol at for > h. the precipitated proteins were washed with cold acetone dried and then dissolved in swelling buffer . to obtain a fraction enriched for phosphorylated proteins the extracted proteins were treated with a phosphoprotein purification kit . proteins in phosphoprotein enriched fractions were precipitated with a d clean up kit . precipitates were dissolved in three equal volumes of precipitant buffer provided by the manufacturer and the mixture was put on ice for min . the precipitate was recovered by centrifugation and dissolved in the same volume of co precipitant and the precipitate was again recovered by centrifugation . the precipitate was dissolved in of water and ml of wash buffer and of wash additive were added to the sample . after incubation at for min the precipitate was recovered air dried and dissolved in buffer that contained mm tris hcl m thiourea m urea and chaps . phosphorylated proteins were labeled with the dige fluor minimal labeling kit with or according to the manufacturer s protocol pmol of dye was added to of protein in the above buffer and the mixture was kept on ice for min . a mixture of labeled proteins from wild type and mutant plants was then subjected to isoelectric focusing with drystrip and ettan ipgphor ii . after subsequent _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ protein spots were visualized with the typhoon system and the intensity of each spot was determined with decyder software . a aliquot of a phosphoprotein enriched fraction of proteins from roots of day old wild type plants were

_PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . blotting and immunodetection were performed as described previously by . signals were detected with west femto maximum sensitivity substrate and _PROTEIN_ mini . for detection of _PROTEIN_ we used specific affinity purified antibodies at a concentration of ml . the protocol for real time rt pcr was a modified version of that described previously _PROTEIN_ . roots of wild type and mutant plants were harvested d after sowing and frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen . total rna was isolated with the high pure rna tissue kit . for the analysis of levels of rnas by real time pcr we prepared ng of total rna for conversion to cdna using revertra . pcr was performed using a green ii kit with primer pairs as follows for _PROTEIN_ ccagagtttgtcgctaaagagc and

s recommendations . all techniques for microscopic analysis were described previously . _METHOD_ was observed with an _PROTEIN_ and confocal microscope . synchronization of the cell cycle was performed basically as described by . cells were cultured for h in medium that contained mg l aphidicolin and washed with fresh medium without aphidicolin . cells were then cultured in medium that contained propyzamide for h and examined after washing with fresh medium without propyzamide . to obtain active _PROTEIN_ we incubated ng of recombinant _PROTEIN_ and ng of _PROTEIN_ in kinase buffer that contained _PROTEIN_ for min at . a aliquot of tag fused _PROTEIN_ and of _PROTEIN_ were added to the reaction mixture which was then incubated for a further min . the kinase reaction was stopped by addition of sample buffer for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and products were separated by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . phosphorylated proteins were detected by autoradiography . the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants were obtained from the _PROTEIN_ . and were renamed _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ respectively . pairs namely _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were crossed to generate double mutants which were confirmed by identifying sites of insertion of the t dnas by pcr analysis . the cdna for _PROTEIN_ was cloned by rt pcr with primers acaagtttgtacaaaaaagcaggcttcatggctcaagaagagatacag and accactttgtacaagaaagctgggtatgcttgggttttggacct . the amplified dna fragment was cloned into with _PROTEIN_ . from this entry clone the recombinant cdna was transferred to various destination vectors by clonase . for _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ fused and mbp fused _PROTEIN_ in e. coli and pdestmal derived from pmal were used as destination vectors respectively . two types of _METHOD_ proteins were fused to _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ which has two amino acid substitutions with alanine and phenylalanine respectively _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ . for _PROTEIN_ of these fusion genes a series of pgwb plasmids was used as destination vectors . the binary vectors were introduced into plants by agrobacterium mediated transformation . to assess the phosphoinositide binding properties of _PROTEIN_ a protein lipid overlay assay was performed by using mbp _PROTEIN_ as described previously _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were _PROTEIN_ from sigma aldrich . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were _PROTEIN_ from wako pure chemical . a lipid solution containing nmol phosphoinositides dissolved in a mixture of chloroform/methanol/water was spotted onto a hybond c extra _LOCATION_ .
