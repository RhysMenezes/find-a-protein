the shoot and root apical _METHOD_ formed during embryogenesis are crucial for postembryonic plant development . we report the identification of popcorn _PROTEIN_ a gene required for embryo development and meristem organization in arabidopsis thaliana . map based cloning revealed that _PROTEIN_ encodes a wd protein _PROTEIN_ both during embryo development and postembryonically in the sam and ram . the two pcn alleles identified in this study are temperature sensitive showing defective embryo development when grown at that is rescued when grown at . in pcn mutants meristem specific _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ related is not _PROTEIN_ shootmeristemless bodenlos _PROTEIN_ and monopteros _PROTEIN_ are misexpressed . several findings link _PROTEIN_ to auxin signaling and meristem function ectopic _PROTEIN_ of green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ pbdl _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and pmp _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in the meristem altered _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in the apical domain of the developing embryo and resistance to auxin in the pcn mutants . the bdl mutation rescued embryo lethality of pcn suggesting that improper auxin response is involved in pcn defects . furthermore _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and topless are dosage sensitive in pcn suggesting functional interaction . together our results suggest that _PROTEIN_ functions in the auxin pathway integrating auxin signaling in the organization and _PROTEIN_ of the sam and ram .
we have determined global gene _PROTEIN_ during embryo development in arabidopsis . these data sets provide a resource for further genetic interrogation . genetic screens and targeted reverse genetic approaches have been successful in identifying key genes in arabidopsis embryo development . to identify genes that are required for arabidopsis embryogenesis we analyzed t dna lines with insertions in selected candidate genes that are specifically or differentially _PROTEIN_ during zygote to globular stages of embryo development based on our global gene _PROTEIN_ data sets . one of the lines from this screen showed early embryo lethality among the segregating embryos with a phenotype resembling popped maize which we named popcorn . the pcn mutation segregated as a single recessive allele . however molecular analysis revealed that this t dna insertion was not linked to the mutant embryo phenotype . we therefore used a map based cloning approach to isolate the _PROTEIN_ gene . a tight linkage was observed with cleaved amplified polymorphic sequences markers at the genomic positions and with no recombination observed in the analysis of chromosomes . the strong globular stage defects in pcn mutant suggest that the _PROTEIN_ of gene in this locus is likely critical for embryo patterning and development . we reasoned that the _PROTEIN_ genes in this genomic region would likely include _PROTEIN_ . the kb region between and on chromosome contains genes of which encode transposable elements . of the remaining nine loci five are of unknown function and the other four are annotated as f box wd pq loop repeat and _PROTEIN_ binding . because _PROTEIN_ is also a wd repeat containing protein that is critical for embryo patterning that involves specification of the apical basal _PROTEIN_ and cotyledon formation we predicted that _GENE_ may be associated with the defective phenotype . _GENE_ also had the highest _PROTEIN_ level among the genes in the deduced kb chromosome region in our microarray data for wild type globular embryos . sequencing of candidate genes in the mapped region of pcn identified a bp deletion overlapping the exon and intron of _GENE_ genic region that would result in a premature stop codon of the predicted open reading frame . _GENE_ encodes an amino acid protein containing eight wd repeats as determined by interproscan six at the n terminus and two at the c terminus . the premature stop codon in pcn was deduced to produce a truncated protein of amino acids . in arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ a single copy gene shares identity with at the amino acid level . putative homologs of _PROTEIN_ are also present in other plant genera yeast zebra fish and humans . in none of these cases is any function known . using the _GENE_ sequence information we screened for additional t dna insertional lines at this locus and identified a second allele of _PROTEIN_ pcn with an insertion in the exon . the pcn plants segregated defective embryos similar in mutant phenotype to those observed in pcn . heterozygous pcn or pcn plants did not exhibit any developmental defects other than producing arrested and normal embryos indicating that pcn and pcn mutations are recessive . to confirm that the mutant embryo phenotypes observed in pcn and pcn are caused by the lesions in the _GENE_ locus we introduced two constructs into heterozygous mutant pcn and pcn plants . the first construct contained the _GENE_ genomic fragment and the second was the _PROTEIN_ cdna under the control of the putative _PROTEIN_ promoter . transformation of both constructs fully complemented the homozygous pcn mutant embryo phenotype . these observations confirmed that _PROTEIN_ a wd repeat containing protein is required for embryo development in arabidopsis . because the other _PROTEIN_ homolog is _PROTEIN_ during embryo development in arabidopsis we sought to assess any functional similarity of with _PROTEIN_ . no knockout lines for this gene are currently available in salk or other collections . to test if this gene can complement pcn we generated a gene construct using the protein coding sequence and _PROTEIN_ it under the control of _PROTEIN_ promoter _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and introduced this construct into the pcn background . the rationale for this approach is that if shares functional domains in its protein with _PROTEIN_ complementation of embryo phenotype is expected . however our transgenic experiments did not show any complementation suggesting that does not share similar functions with _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis . together these results confirm that _PROTEIN_ is a single copy putative wd domain encoding gene essential for embryo development in arabidopsis . we investigated the developmental aspects of pcn using the pcn allele . homozygous pcn seeds obtained from a pcn/ mother plant that was grown at did not germinate . however when cultured in vitro with auxin and cytokinin these mutant embryos were able to form calli from which fertile plants could be regenerated . these homozygous pcn plants upon flowering produced embryos that were all defective . as this provided an advantage over the segregating heterozygote we have used these nonsegregating homozygous lines for more detailed developmental studies . during wild type embryogenesis the zygote elongates and divides asymmetrically generating a smaller apical and a larger basal cell . the first two divisions of the apical cell occur longitudinally giving rise to the four cell embryo proper followed by a round of horizontal divisions to establish the eight cell embryo . tangential divisions separate the protoderm from the inner cells at the dermatogen stage . _PROTEIN_ the globular embryo initiates two cotyledonary primordia and a sam . the descendants of the basal cell divide horizontally to generate a column of cells the extraembryonic suspensor . only the uppermost cell of the basal lineage the hypophysis contributes to the embryo . after a transverse division the apical daughter cell of the hypophysis the lens shaped cell gives rise to the _PROTEIN_ of the root meristem whereas the basal daughter cell _METHOD_ the columella stem cells . development of pcn embryos was similar to the wild type until the two cell embryo stage . subsequently with delayed apical cell divisions more suspensor cells were observed when compared with the wild type . occasionally abnormal vertical divisions in suspensor cells and octant embryo proper with twice the number of cells than in the wild type were also observed in pcn . from the dermatogen stage and onwards the pcn embryo proper displayed several defects . abnormal and delayed divisions were observed in the apical domain resulting in four kinds of phenotypes no cotyledon one cotyledon unequal splayed two cotyledons and three cotyledons . since pcn embryos displayed stronger defects than pcn further analysis was done with pcn . the sam region in the majority of arrested embryos was enlarged and the cotyledons lacked bilateral symmetry and appeared more radialized . in the basal domain of pcn embryos the lens shaped cell derivatives were smaller than in the wild type and the lower hypophyseal cell derivatives divided less frequently resulting in aberrant columella organization . together the results show that loss of _PROTEIN_ activity affects the development of both the embryo proper and the suspensor . while testing the growth of pcn plants at different temperatures we noticed that the defects in pcn embryo development were strongly alleviated after shifting the regenerated homozygous plants from to at the onset of bolting . the majority of the pcn embryos produced at had two wild type like cotyledons and developed into normal mature embryos . the remaining embryos had no cotyledon one cotyledon and three cotyledons . unlike seeds from pcn homozygous plants grown at of pcn seeds produced at were able to germinate on murashige and skoog _METHOD_ medium without the requirement of exogenous hormones and produced fertile plants . we took advantage of the temperature sensitivity characteristic of this mutant and propagated pcn and genetic combinations involving pcn by first growing the plants at and then shifting them to at bolting unless specified otherwise . to determine at which embryo stage _PROTEIN_ function is essential pcn plants were grown at and flower buds were first emasculated and then hand pollinated with pcn pollen . a few of the developing siliques were dissected to determine the developmental stage of the embryos . the plants were then shifted to to complete seed development . mature seeds were either dissected to assess the embryo phenotypes or geminated on _METHOD_ medium . our results from this study showed that the shift to must occur at or prior to the globular stage in order to rescue the pcn embryo development . a shift in temperature postglobular stage of embryo development could not suppress embryo lethality . these observations further suggest that _PROTEIN_ function is required already for early phases of embryo development in arabidopsis . to address the postembryonic functions of _PROTEIN_ temperature rescued pcn mutant seeds were germinated and plant development was analyzed at growth conditions . pcn mutant rosettes were smaller with narrower leaf shape and abnormal vein patterns compared with the wild type . flowering pcn plants were shorter and bushier than the wild type . examination of pcn roots revealed abnormal division patterns in the _PROTEIN_ and columella cells of the root cap and root growth was retarded compared with the wild type . lugol staining for starch granules as a marker for columella cell differentiation revealed defects in the root cap cells in addition to the ram defects observed in pcn . furthermore the _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ marker _PROTEIN_ was expanded in pcn roots . these observations suggest that _PROTEIN_ function is also required after germination for several processes associated with _METHOD_ both in root and shoot development . to study _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and subcellular localization in detail two different translational fusions of _PROTEIN_ and green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ coding regions were _PROTEIN_ under the control of kb _PROTEIN_ putative promoter region one with _PROTEIN_ cdna _METHOD_ and the other with _PROTEIN_ genomic fragment _METHOD_ . independent transgenic lines of both constructs displayed identical _PROTEIN_ patterns . for brevity we will focus on results from the gpcn _METHOD_ reporter . our earlier study on global gene _PROTEIN_ patterns during arabidopsis embryo development showed that gpcn _METHOD_ is _PROTEIN_ in the ovule but not in the pollen and after fertilization is _PROTEIN_ in the zygote suggesting maternal specificity . during early phases of embryogenesis the gpcn _METHOD_ signal was detected in all the cells of the embryo proper and the suspensor until the cell embryo stage . subsequently gpcn _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was not detectable in the lower suspensor cells and by the heart stage the signal was completely absent in the suspensor but remained detectable in the embryo proper . in seedlings gpcn _METHOD_ was detected in the sam and leaf primordia but not in the hypocotyl . in the root gpcn _METHOD_ is _PROTEIN_ in the root meristem . gpcn _METHOD_ is also _PROTEIN_ in pericycle cells both quiescent and actively dividing that gave rise to the _PROTEIN_ roots and the _PROTEIN_ continued throughout the development of _PROTEIN_ root primordia . these results indicate that _PROTEIN_ is broadly _PROTEIN_ in the embryo proper but after germination is predominantly _PROTEIN_ in the sam ram and in cells capable of proliferation . to better understand the sam defects in pcn we investigated the _PROTEIN_ patterns of well characterized sam organizing genes using whole mount embryo in situ hybridization and reporter genes . in the wild type shoot meristem _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ domains mark the three apical layers of stem cells and the underlying organizing center respectively . in pcn embryos _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ in an enlarged domain encompassing almost the whole apex and was also ectopically _PROTEIN_ in the cotyledons . compared with the wild type _PROTEIN_ mrna _PROTEIN_ had expanded into the and layers of the sam and toward the inner layers of the cotyledons . _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ marks sam cells that do not enter into _PROTEIN_ organ formation . during wild type embryogenesis _PROTEIN_ is first _PROTEIN_ in a band of cells around the central apical region of _PROTEIN_ globular stage embryos . during the transition to heart stage the _PROTEIN_ becomes restricted to the central core of the sam . in pcn _PROTEIN_ was variably _PROTEIN_ below the layer of the sam . in the majority of the embryos examined _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was detected in a large apical region of the embryo . _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ in the and layers of the wild type sam . in pcn _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was still limited to the and layers but the _PROTEIN_ domain had expanded to a slightly broader region compared with the wild type . furthermore quantitative rt pcr results revealed that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ cuc and _PROTEIN_ in the sam are significantly upregulated in pcn embryos . these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ function is required to restrict the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and clv genes within their respective specified boundaries in the meristem . to determine whether _PROTEIN_ genetically interacts with _PROTEIN_ we analyzed pcn wus double mutants . wus embryos develop normally except for the absence of a shoot meristem in the seedlings after germination . double heterozygous pcn/ wus/ plants produced homozygous recessive pcn wus double mutant embryos at a ratio of that did not initiate cotyledon primordia and had seeds that did not germinate even when the mother plant was grown at . however pcn wus seeds germinated and produced plants with rosette leaves albeit at a slower rate than the wild type . after bolting however the sam terminated as pin like structures with arrested _PROTEIN_ organ primordia and differentiation of the epidermal cells into trichomes near the sam region indicating haploinsufficiency for _PROTEIN_ in pcn background . these observations indicate that wus embryos can not complete their development unless _PROTEIN_ function is present . whereas the lack of _PROTEIN_ can be remedied by high temperature insofar as embryo development is concerned such a rescue requires _PROTEIN_ . these synergistic defects suggest partial compensatory functions for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ during embryo and postembryonic development . defective cotyledon patterning in pcn embryos raised the question whether auxin response and/or auxin transport were affected in pcn embryos . to address this question we introduced the auxin response marker _METHOD_ and as a readout of _PROTEIN_ auxin transport machinery _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ into the pcn mutant . at _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was observed throughout the embryo proper in pcn similar to the wild type up to the octant stage . however from cell globular stage onwards the basal auxin maximum which is restricted to the hypophyseal region in the wild type expanded into the lower suspensor cells in arrested globular pcn embryos . the two auxin maxima corresponding to the two emerging cotyledon primordia in the wild type were absent in the pcn embryos that did not produce cotyledons . in pcn embryos that did form cotyledons the auxin maxima correlated with the number of cotyledons . in a few mutant embryos several auxin maxima were also observed in the apical region of _PROTEIN_ torpedo stage embryos . in contrast with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in the vascular procambial cells of _PROTEIN_ stage wild type embryos the _METHOD_ signal was discontinuous or absent in the differentiating procambial cells of pcn embryos . unlike the wild type _METHOD_ was ectopically _PROTEIN_ in the sam of pcn embryos . consistent with the phenotypic recovery this ectopic _PROTEIN_ was suppressed when pcn embryos were subjected to treatment . in the ram the _PROTEIN_ became restricted to the columella region similar to the wild type . these results indicate that mislocalization of auxin maxima coincides with the defective phenotypes observed in pcn mutant embryos . in wild type dermatogen stage embryos _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ is present in all the cell boundaries whereas at the cell stage _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ becomes restricted to the basal boundaries of subepidermal cells . from _PROTEIN_ globular stage onwards _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ is localized in cotyledon primordia and in vascular initials as shown previously . in pcn embryos arrested at globular stage _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ appeared in a broad central region of the embryo and the _PROTEIN_ was seen in the vascular initials of the cotyledons and the hypocotyl of one cotyledon and two cotyledon embryos . in contrast with the wild type _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ also accumulated in the sam region of the pcn embryos with two cotyledons . while the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ profile was relatively normal _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was not distributed in a _PROTEIN_ manner in the majority of the cells of pcn mutant embryos . since _PROTEIN_ localized _PROTEIN_ in the wild type can be rapidly internalized to the _LOCATION_ by brefeldin a treatment we used bfa treatment along with the _LOCATION_ stain to examine the localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in the cells of wild type and pcn embryos . in the wild type _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signal overlapped with the stain in the basal _LOCATION_ of cells whereas with bfa treatment _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ became internalized in the _LOCATION_ . however in the pcn mutant embryos the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was internalized to the _LOCATION_ both without and with bfa treatment suggesting that pcn mutant embryos are defective in _PROTEIN_ localization of _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and localization is coordinated with _PROTEIN_ in the embryo proper to create auxin maxima in the hypophyseal cell at the cell stage . we used _PROTEIN_ gus to compare its _PROTEIN_ pattern in the pcn embryo and the wild type . in the wild type _PROTEIN_ gus was detected in the hypophyseal cell derivatives in the embryonic root meristem and the provascular cells in the developing hypocotyl . in those pcn embryos that were arrested at early stages the _PROTEIN_ was present in the suspensor but absent from the hypophyseal cell derivatives of the root meristem . although the _PROTEIN_ gus _PROTEIN_ was present in the provascular cells of the developing pcn embryo the signal appeared weaker and was restricted to fewer cells and was absent in the root meristem region . in wild type seedlings _PROTEIN_ gus was _PROTEIN_ in the root meristem and vascular cells of the root and cotyledons . by contrast in pcn the _PROTEIN_ gus was weakly _PROTEIN_ in the vascular cells of the root but was absent in the root meristem and vascular cells of the cotyledons . these results were consistent with the qrt pcr analysis that showed that _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ fold lower than the wild type . taken together pcn mutants displayed altered _PROTEIN_ localization and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . to test whether auxin response is altered in pcn mutants we performed a _PROTEIN_ root induction assay by application of the auxin analog naphthalene acetic acid to seedlings . in the wild type _PROTEIN_ root primordia induced by mg/l naa displayed normal _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . however in pcn naa induced abnormal bulges of pericycle cells with diffused _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ that did not differentiate into _PROTEIN_ root primordia . thus while auxin maxima displayed by _METHOD_ appeared in the proper position subsequent root development required _PROTEIN_ activity . in an alternate assay to measure the strength of the auxin response in pcn mutants we used the phs _PROTEIN_ gus reporter . in the phs _PROTEIN_ gus construct the gus gene is fused to the n terminal domains i and ii of the _PROTEIN_ and its _PROTEIN_ is controlled by a heat shock promoter . due to the inclusion of the degron containing domain ii of _PROTEIN_ the associated gus is subject to degradation in an auxin responsive manner . as shown in figures to and the fusion protein was more stable in pcn seedlings than in the wild type as visualized by gus suggesting that indole acetic acid protein turnover is affected in pcn mutant . these results collectively show that _PROTEIN_ plays a role in auxin response pathway . the iaa/aux arf auxin module _PROTEIN_ mediates auxin transcriptional response and together with _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ positively regulates _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in root and vascular development . in pcn the _PROTEIN_ domains of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in the embryonic ram were more restricted compared with the wild type also in the vascular initials of the pcn embryo _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was discontinuous and ectopic in the sam region of the torpedo embryo . thus aberrations in the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were more pronounced in the pcn embryos that showed stronger developmental defects . consistent with this observation _PROTEIN_ gus in the pcn mutant showed ectopic _PROTEIN_ in the apical region of the embryo that included the sam and the cotyledon primordia . furthermore qrt pcr showed that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were significantly upregulated in pcn embryos . these findings prompted us to investigate potential interactions between pcn and auxin mutants . mp single mutants develop a basal stump instead of a root and produce one or two cotyledons . in the progeny of pcn/ mp/ plants we identified putative double mutants at a ratio with a novel embryo phenotype . these double mutant embryos showed cup like cotyledons with a narrow embryo axis compared with the wild type . these embryos were arrested not only at but also at similar to the observations with double mutants of pcn and wus suggesting that _PROTEIN_ functions are required for the rescue of the pcn mutant at . the pcn mp/ plants were small and had delayed rosette leaf and root growth and the sam terminated into pin like structures compared with pcn single mutant and mp/ heterozygotes that flower normally . these observations suggest that _PROTEIN_ cooperates with _PROTEIN_ to mediate auxin signals during embryonic and postembryonic developmental _METHOD_ in arabidopsis . _PROTEIN_ is considered a repressor of _PROTEIN_ in auxin signaling during embryo development and the bdl gain of function mutant resembles the mp loss of function mutant . we investigated _PROTEIN_ interaction with _PROTEIN_ using a pcn bdl double mutant . the bdl mutant line we used was in the columbia background and displayed abnormal horizontal divisions in the apical cell of the embryo as observed in the landsberg _LOCATION_ background but at a lower frequency . in the pcn bdl double mutant in the col background of embryos showed abnormal divisions at the octant stage that also include double octant phenotype and tapered embryo phenotypes in _PROTEIN_ stages of development . thus during early embryo development pcn enhanced the bdl embryo defects . furthermore the pcn bdl double mutant had fewer suspensor cells than both pcn or bdl single mutants . at the heart stage pcn bdl embryos displayed a broader central zone than the wild type or pcn single mutant . however during embryo development the globular stage arrest cotyledon defects and seed abortion observed in the pcn single mutant at were suppressed by the presence of bdl in the double mutant . the pcn bdl set viable seeds at unlike the pcn single mutant that requires treatment . to examine if _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is altered in pcn mutant we introduced pbdl _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ reporter into pcn . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was first detected in the vascular initials and the ram of the wild type embryos . however in pcn _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was detected in the sam region but was absent in the vascular initials and the embryonic ram from torpedo stage onwards when grown at . this altered _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in pcn was restored to a normal wild type like pattern at suggesting that the pcn mutant phenotype at is dependent on _PROTEIN_ wild type function . taken together the quantitative enhancement of auxin related defects of both mp and bdl mutants in pcn background suggests that _PROTEIN_ is required for gene functions overlapping with those of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in embryogenesis . these embryonic observations are consistent with a contribution of _PROTEIN_ to the auxin induced degradation of multiple auxin/iaa proteins . we performed a yeast two hybrid assay to determine whether _PROTEIN_ physically interacts with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ . when _PROTEIN_ fragments other than the c terminal region or a full length _PROTEIN_ was used as the bait _PROTEIN_ showed very strong self activation . the c terminal fragment did not show self activation and it did not show any physical interaction between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ . when we used _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ as the bait and _PROTEIN_ as the prey we did not observe any physical interaction of _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ . however qrt pcr analyses of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in pcn mutant embryo revealed that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ are similar to the wild type but _PROTEIN_ and its target genes _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ like are significantly upregulated and fold respectively compared with the wild type . previous work has shown that _PROTEIN_ binds to the _PROTEIN_ promoter and regulates its transcription positively . consistently upregulated _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in pcn also increased the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in this study . the loss of function mutant drn shows defective embryo patterning and functional postembryonic sam whereas the gain of function drn d mutant shows defective sam and upregulated _PROTEIN_ of both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ as seen in pcn . the pcn drn double mutant showed the pcn embryo phenotype . however after rescue at and during postembryonic development the young rosettes terminated growth with arrested sam and radialized leaf primordia which were not observed in the respective single mutants further supporting the involvement of _PROTEIN_ mediated auxin signaling in meristem regulation . the absence of _PROTEIN_ interaction with _PROTEIN_ in the assay does not rule out interaction via other partner . taken together _PROTEIN_ may function in a multiprotein complex that includes _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ to regulate the downstream genes in the auxin pathway that includes _PROTEIN_ . double mutants of pcn and _PROTEIN_ pid or tpl arrested embryo development at albeit the respective single mutants completed embryogenesis and produced viable seeds . these observations suggest that the rescue of pcn embryo lethality by elevated temperatures requires the functions of the auxin components _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and the global corepressor _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ promotes directional auxin efflux and _PROTEIN_ mediates the switch of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . both _PROTEIN_ and pid single mutants upon bolting form pin like structures with an undifferentiated inflorescence meristem at the tip . unlike in pcn or _PROTEIN_ and pid heterozygous plants in pcn _PROTEIN_ and pcn pid plants inflorescence shoot meristem terminated in a pin like structure and _PROTEIN_ organ primordia were arrested . in all cases trichomes and guard cells which are normally restricted to leaves or leaf primordia were found at the tip of the pin like structure in the meristem region indicative of precocious differentiation of meristem cells . as one of its functions _PROTEIN_ acts as a corepressor with _PROTEIN_ in a complex with _PROTEIN_ . tpl and tpl plants developed similar to the wild type after bolting whereas the pcn tpl inflorescence _METHOD_ also terminated in a pin like inflorescence . taken together in the absence of _PROTEIN_ function inflorescence meristem development becomes more sensitive to the gene dosage of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ .
arabidopsis thaliana plants were grown on soil or in sterile culture on _METHOD_ medium containing _METHOD_ salts . after incubation for at least d at in darkness plants were grown in growth chambers under long day conditions at or . homozygous pcn plants and double mutants of pcn were grown at until they began to flower and then shifted to except pcn bdl which was grown at . details of mutants and marker lines used in this study are listed in supplemental table online . prior to mapping the pcn mutant was backcrossed four times to wild type col pcn wild type ler and plants were used for mapping . crosses with known genetic markers indicated that _PROTEIN_ mapped close to the centromere of chromosome . because no known genetic markers were available in this region we designed caps markers . then plants were assayed for these markers on the long arm close to the centromere of chromosome . the initial mapping was done using simple sequence repeat markers from the arabidopsis information resource . the derived caps markers used for fine mapping of the pcn mutation were generated based on the sequence information of col and ler . ppcn _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ constructs were

products were digested with noti and then the fragments were ligated . finally we used the primers aaagcggccgcacacttctccttctgcttccgtc and aaaaggatccagttccaaaaatatgtctgtc to amplify ppcn _PROTEIN_

amplification of antisense rnas was performed as described in the messageamp ii arna kit following the protocol for first round arna amplification . the respective double stranded cdnas were synthesized from arna as described in the messageamptm ii arna kit . the concentration of the cdna template was measured using nanodrop and further normalized using tubulin as reference prior to performing qrt pcr . gene specific primers were designed using primer software . qrt pcr primers and results are listed in supplemental table online . for bfa treatment and staining the wild type and pcn embryos were isolated and treated as described earlier . to determine the auxin response of pcn both mutants and wild type seeds were surface sterilized . these seeds were incubated at for d and then were germinated on _METHOD_ for d. these seedlings were transferred to _METHOD_ supplemented with mg/l naa . seedling phenotypes were examined at and d with naa in the medium . the response was evaluated by analyzing _PROTEIN_ root development as well as _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . both phs _PROTEIN_ gus and pcn/phs _PROTEIN_ gus seeds were germinated in _METHOD_ for d and then heat shocked for h
