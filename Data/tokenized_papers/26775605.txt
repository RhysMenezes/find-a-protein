_PROTEIN_ associated kinase _PROTEIN_ was initially identified as a co receptor of the brassinosteroid receptor _PROTEIN_ . genetic analyses also revealed that _PROTEIN_ and its closest homolog _PROTEIN_ like _PROTEIN_ regulate a br independent cell death control pathway . the double null mutant _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ displays a salicylic acid and light dependent cell death phenotype even without pathogen invasion . molecular _METHOD_ of the spontaneous cell death mediated by _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ remain unknown . here we report our identification of a suppressor of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . genetic analyses indicated that cell death _METHOD_ in a weak double mutant _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were completely suppressed by the loss of function mutation in which encodes a nucleoporin like protein . genetic analyses also demonstrated that individually knocking out three other nucleoporin genes from the located sub complex was also able to rescue the cell death phenotype of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . in addition a dead box rna helicase _PROTEIN_ was identified in the same protein complex as via a proteomic approach . the _PROTEIN_ mutation also rescues the cell death _METHOD_ of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . further analyses indicated that export of poly rna was greatly blocked in the nup and _PROTEIN_ mutants resulting in accumulation of significant levels of mrnas in the _LOCATION_ . over _PROTEIN_ of a bacterial nahg gene to inactivate salicylic acid also rescues the cell death phenotype of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . mutants suppressing cell death _METHOD_ always showed greatly reduced salicylic acid contents . these results suggest that nucleocytoplasmic trafficking especially of molecules directly or indirectly involved in endogenous salicylic acid accumulation is critical in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mediated cell death control .
to understand the molecular _METHOD_ of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mediated cell death control we transformed an activation tagging vector _PROTEIN_ into _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ to screen for genetic modifiers of the double mutant . within progeny generated from approximately self pollinated lines one of the suppressors showed a fully rescued cell death phenotype which was subsequently named _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . after back crossing _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ all the progeny exhibited a phenotype similar to _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . however in the progeny approximately a quarter of the plants showed a wild type like phenotype and three quarters exhibited a typical cell death phenotype suggesting that a single recessive locus is responsible for the suppression phenotype . molecular cloning of the genomic sequences flanking the t dna insertion site revealed that a t dna was inserted in the sixth exon of _GENE_ which encodes a putative like protein . confocal microscopic analysis indicated that the _METHOD_ fusion protein is indeed localized on the _LOCATION_ envelope . an single mutant was then generated by back crossing _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ with col . the second t dna insertion allele of was obtained from the arabidopsis biological resource center . rt pcr analyses showed that transcripts of full length were not present in either or mutants confirming that both alleles are null alleles . neither allele alone displays any visible phenotypes compared to col . to examine whether cell death in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is truly suppressed by removal of trypan blue staining was used to detect dead cells in the cotyledons of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ triple mutant plants and various other mutants . the results showed that cell death only occurs extensively in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant but not in wt single mutants or _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ triple mutants . in our previous studies we found that the sa responsive genes _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are significantly up regulated in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant compared to col . _PROTEIN_ of these three genes is drastically elevated in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant compared to col but greatly suppressed in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ triple mutants . consistent with this the endogenous level of total sa is increased in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant and is almost restored to a wt like level in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ triple mutants . to further confirm that is responsible for suppression of cell death in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ a vector _PROTEIN_ genomic dna driven by a native promoter _PROTEIN_ was transformed into the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ triple mutant and the results showed that _PROTEIN_ g recapitulates the cell death phenotype . the genetic backgrounds were verified by rt pcr analyses . relative _PROTEIN_ of pr genes and the endogenous sa level in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were partially restored by _PROTEIN_ . these results demonstrate that the putative nucleoporin negatively regulates _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ controlled cell death . to verify that the cell death seen in both the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutants is sa dependent we over _PROTEIN_ nahg a bacterial gene that encodes a hydroxylase that inactivates sa in the double mutants . over _PROTEIN_ of nahg partially rescued the cell death phenotype of the null double mutant _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and almost fully restored the dwarf and cell death phenotypes of the weak double mutant _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . the relative _PROTEIN_ of pr genes and the endogenous sa content in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were restored to wt like levels by nahg . these results suggest that the cell death in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is sa dependent . although the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plants did not display distinctive phenotypes when grown on sa free medium for weeks _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were less sensitive to exogenous sa treatment than the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant . our results indicate that compared to _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ sa accumulation is restored in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ triple mutants . these data suggest that modulates cell death by altering the endogenous level of sa in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . it is likely that sa is one of the _PROTEIN_ regulators of the cell death seen in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutants . the _PROTEIN_ sub complex located on the outer _PROTEIN_ of the _LOCATION_ pore complex is the largest sub complex conserved in vertebrates and plants . in vertebrates a homolog of belongs to the _PROTEIN_ sub complex . in plants the _PROTEIN_ sub complex contains eight putative nups _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ for which only limited functions have been determined in plants . the specificity and overlapping functions of putative members of the _PROTEIN_ sub complex prompted us to test whether additional nups other than in this sub complex contribute to _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mediated cell death control . seven available t dna insertion mutants of the nups in the _PROTEIN_ sub complex were crossed with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ to generate triple mutants . rt pcr analyses verified the genetic backgrounds of these mutants . trypan blue staining showed that individual knockout of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ but not _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ is able to almost fully rescue the cell death phenotype of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in cotyledons . the _PROTEIN_ of pr genes and endogenous sa levels were drastically down regulated in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ triple mutants compared to _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . although the _PROTEIN_ of pr genes and endogenous sa contents were partially suppressed in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ compared to _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ the sa levels remain relatively high in the triple mutants and the suppression of sa levels was not enough to suppress the cell death of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . these results indicated that four members of the _PROTEIN_ sub complex play more significant roles in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mediated cell death control . nucleocytoplasmic trafficking is an essential means of subcellular communication between cytoplasm and _LOCATION_ in which the _LOCATION_ pore complex plays a central role . studies of plant nups are still in their infancy compared to those in vertebrates humans and yeasts . identification of novel components associated with the plant _LOCATION_ pore complex largely relies on proteomic approaches . recently tamura et al . discovered nups using interactive proteomics and linear ion trap _METHOD_ spectrometer analyses . using _METHOD_ transgenic plants we used a proteomic method to discover novel components associated with . after immunoprecipitation followed by an lc _METHOD_ assay a number of interacting proteins including dead box rna helicases were obtained . it was previously reported that some dead box rna helicases and rna binding proteins contribute to plant responses to various biotic and abiotic stresses . transient _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ showed that _PROTEIN_ localizes in the _LOCATION_ . we therefore selected dead box rna _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ which was co immunoprecipitated with for further analyses . a _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ triple mutant was subsequently generated by genetic crossing . the genetic backgrounds were verified by rt pcr analyses . the dwarfism cell death phenotype _PROTEIN_ of pr genes and endogenous sa content of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were all suppressed by the loss of function mutation of _PROTEIN_ . to further investigate whether _PROTEIN_ is associated with the _PROTEIN_ sub complex we performed yeast two hybrid analyses to examine interactions of _PROTEIN_ with members of the _PROTEIN_ sub complex . the results showed that _PROTEIN_ is able to physically interact with _PROTEIN_ suggesting that _PROTEIN_ is indeed associated with the _PROTEIN_ sub complex . these results indicate that _PROTEIN_ is indeed required for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mediated cell death control possibly by coordinating with nups . the _PROTEIN_ that and _PROTEIN_ suppress the cell death phenotype of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ suggests that rna regulation such as mrna export is critical for cell death control . thus whole mount in situ hybridization of mrna was performed in various and _PROTEIN_ mutants . our data showed extensive mrna accumulation in the _LOCATION_ of the and _PROTEIN_ single mutants as well as the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ triple mutants . translocation of mrnas is also more or less blocked in the _LOCATION_ of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and single mutants and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ triple mutants but not in or _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutants . these results clearly indicate that in addition to _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ whose functions in rna export have been reported previously in arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and also contribute significantly to mrna export . to examine whether the sa biosynthetic mrnas remain in the _LOCATION_ we chose and _PROTEIN_ mutants which are able to fully restore the cell death phenotype of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ for further investigation . we analyzed the relative _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ key genes that regulate sa biosynthesis in the cytoplasmic and _LOCATION_ fractions of col and _PROTEIN_ mutants . however _PROTEIN_ of these genes was too low to be detectable in separated cytoplasmic or _LOCATION_ fractions even when using ng of cdna as the template for a cycle amplification especially for _PROTEIN_ . in addition _PROTEIN_ of these sa related genes was not obviously increased in the _LOCATION_ of and _PROTEIN_ mutants compared with col suggesting that mutations of or _PROTEIN_ affect export of certain unknown mrnas that may indirectly regulate sa production .
