_PROTEIN_ is the enzyme responsible for the formation of uroporphyrinogen iii the precursor of all cellular tetrapyrroles including haem chlorophyll and bilins . although _PROTEIN_ genes have been cloned from many _METHOD_ the level of sequence conservation between them is low making sequence similarity searches difficult . as an alternative approach to identify the _PROTEIN_ gene from plants we used functional complementation since this does not require conservation of primary sequence . a mutant of saccharomyces cerevisiae was constructed in which the gene encoding _PROTEIN_ was deleted . this mutant was transformed with an arabidopsis thaliana cdna library in a yeast _PROTEIN_ vector and two colonies were obtained that could grow in the absence of haem . the rescuing plasmids encoded an orf of amino acids which when subcloned into an escherichia coli _PROTEIN_ vector was able to complement an e. coli _PROTEIN_ mutant defective in _PROTEIN_ . final proof that the orf encoded _PROTEIN_ came from the _PROTEIN_ that the recombinant protein _PROTEIN_ with an n terminal histidine tag was found to have _PROTEIN_ activity . comparison of the sequence of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ with the human enzyme found that the seven invariant residues previously identified were conserved including three shown to be important for enzyme activity . furthermore a structure based homology search of the protein database with _PROTEIN_ identified the human crystal structure . _PROTEIN_ has an n terminal extension compared with orthologues from other _METHOD_ suggesting that this might act as a targeting sequence . the precursor protein of kda translated in vitro was imported into isolated chloroplasts and processed to the mature size of kda . confocal microscopy of plant cells transiently _PROTEIN_ a fusion protein of _PROTEIN_ with _METHOD_ _METHOD_ confirmed that _PROTEIN_ was targeted exclusively to chloroplasts in vivo .
the short homology flanking pcr technique was used to construct yeast strain in which the endogenous gene encoding _PROTEIN_ was replaced with a kanamycin resistance gene via homologous recombination . this replacement was confirmed by pcr using specific primers . strain could grow on ypd as long as it was supplemented with haemin . however the mutant was unable to grow on non fermentable _PROTEIN_ sources such as glycerol since it lacked respiratory cytochromes . interestingly it was also unable to grow on minimal _PROTEIN_ medium even in the presence of all of the required nutrients plus haemin thus providing a distinctive phenotype for selection of functionally complemented cells . the mutant was transformed with an arabidopsis cdna library constructed in a yeast _PROTEIN_ vector . two independent transformants were obtained based on their ability to grow on a minimal _PROTEIN_ medium in the absence of uracil and haemin . both could grow on rich _PROTEIN_ medium in the absence of exogenous haemin and could utilize non fermentable _PROTEIN_ sources such as glycerol indicative of the restoration of normal respiratory function in the mitochondria of both clones . to confirm that the complementation was due to the presence of the arabidopsis cdnas rather than reversion plasmids were isolated from the complemented strains and transformed back into the mutant . as expected both plasmids complemented the respiratory defect of the mutant . the two complementing plasmids named and were digested with to excise the cdnas from the vector and found to be and kbp respectively . the inserts were subcloned into pbluescript ii _PROTEIN_ to generate and and sequenced whereupon the reason for the difference in size between the two clones was established . both shared an identical orf of amino acids but encoded a second orf of amino acids on the complementary strand downstream of the first orf . the nucleotide sequence of the orf common to both plasmids was used to query the arabidopsis sequence database with blast on the ncbi server and an arabidopsis genomic bac clone was identified that was identical with the cdna except at two positions where single nucleotide _METHOD_ occurred . this is probably due to microstructural differences between ecotype landsberg _LOCATION_ the source of the cdna library and columbia the ecotype from which the genome was sequenced . the bac clone mapped to chromosome ii and no other region of the genome was identified that had sequence similarity to the cdna . comparison of the cdna with the genomic sequence revealed that the gene comprised nine exons separated by eight introns all with consensus splice sites . in the original annotation of the arabidopsis genome part of the bac sequence matching the cdna was incorrectly predicted to encode a amino acid hypothetical protein of unknown function _PROTEIN_ starting from the middle of the fourth exon to the end of the gene but omitting the sixth exon . the inaccuracy of initial annotation particularly for genes without ests _PROTEIN_ is common and it is estimated that only approx . of the originally annotated genes are structurally correct . the protein sequences of the second orf of when searched against the arabidopsis genome matched imperfectly an annotated putative _PROTEIN_ protein from the bac clone . the putative _PROTEIN_ gene was predicted to encode a amino acid protein almost twice the size of the second orf of . the extra sequences were predominantly found at the c terminus of the protein . at first glance the apparent differences could be due to the isolated cdna being a truncated clone . however this was unlikely considering the _PROTEIN_ that the coding sequences of the cdna were flanked by untranslated regions at both ends . moreover the nucleotide and the amino acid sequences of the isolated cdna matched a previously reported _PROTEIN_ gene from chromosome i . subsequent analysis at the nucleotide level revealed some mistakes in the prediction of the coding sequences of the annotated gene which accounted for the discrepancy seen at the amino acid level . the apparently longer n terminus of the annotated protein was due to a falsely predicted first exon from a region that corresponds to the first intron of the _PROTEIN_ gene . the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ contributing to the extra sequences at the c terminus of the annotated protein came from the six additional exons predicted after the _PROTEIN_ termination codon which entirely overlapped the downstream _PROTEIN_ gene . hence the annotated sequence is a fusion of the _PROTEIN_ and the _PROTEIN_ coding sequences which explains the longer than expected translated polypeptide . this discovery also indicates that the second orf of in _PROTEIN_ codes for a _PROTEIN_ enzyme of amino acid residues whose gene resides on chromosome i of arabidopsis . the chimeric clone was probably an artefact generated during the construction of the cdna library a not uncommon occurrence . to provide independent evidence of the function of the orf common to the two complementing plasmids plasmid was transformed into the e. coli _PROTEIN_ mutant which grows as microcolonies . normal sized colonies were observed on lb medium demonstrating that the cdna was able to complement the defect and to the same extent as the _PROTEIN_ gene from a. nidulans . this indicates that the orf encodes a functional _PROTEIN_ this is referred to as _PROTEIN_ from now on . the complete cdna from was subcloned into a pet _PROTEIN_ vector to _PROTEIN_ the protein with an n terminal tag and transformed into e. coli strain . analysis of total cell proteins by _PROTEIN_ revealed that after induction with iptg a strongly staining band of kda was visible which was not seen in uninduced cells . the identity of the protein was confirmed by n terminal sequencing . however the majority of protein was in inclusion bodies with very little in the soluble fraction . _PROTEIN_ appears to have an n terminal extension compared with _PROTEIN_ proteins from other _METHOD_ most probably an organelle targeting peptide . we made a construct in which the first residues were removed but on induction with iptg the cells died . the reason for the lethality of this construct is unknown so in an attempt to avoid this problem another construct was made in which the _PROTEIN_ protein started at residue corresponding to the predicted start of the mature protein . this time there was no effect on cell viability and after induction with iptg a protein of approx . kda was seen in e. coli extracts . this corresponds to amino acid residues from _PROTEIN_ with an extra amino acids at the n terminus from the vector sequence _METHOD_ . moreover it was also present in the soluble phase providing the opportunity to carry out enzymatic analysis on the protein . accordingly we purified the recombinant _PROTEIN_ using the n terminal tag . figure shows _PROTEIN_ analysis of the different steps of the _PROTEIN_ purification . in the purification mg of _PROTEIN_ of cell culture was recovered . a coupled assay was employed to test _PROTEIN_ activity using purified recombinant p. aeruginosa _PROTEIN_ synthase and b. megaterium _PROTEIN_ deaminase to generate hmb _PROTEIN_ enzymatically from ala. recombinant _PROTEIN_ was able to convert hmb into uroporphyrinogen iii as demonstrated by both fluorimetric and spectroscopic detection of the oxidized product uroporphyrin iii . the possibility that this was due to oxidized uroporphyrinogen i formed non enzymatically was ruled out by the _PROTEIN_ that heat inactivated enzyme produced no measurable change in _METHOD_ nor did the assay to which no _PROTEIN_ was added . the rate of product formation was linear over min and also proportional to the amount of purified _PROTEIN_ added up to . the calculated specific activity was of protein although this may not be the true rate of _PROTEIN_ since this might be limited by substrate availability from the coupling enzymes . during purification of _PROTEIN_ a gel permeation chromatography step was included . by reference to the elution of molecular _METHOD_ standards a relative molecular _METHOD_ of da for native _PROTEIN_ was deduced compared with da predicted for the monomeric protein with an n terminal tag . this suggested that _PROTEIN_ is a homodimeric protein . however purification of _PROTEIN_ from e. coli rat liver euglena gracilis and human _LOCATION_ found in all cases that the purified enzyme was a monomer with a molecular _METHOD_ of approx . kda and it is unlikely that the plant enzyme should behave differently . rather the unusual asymmetric shape of the protein as seen in the crystal structure of the human enzyme may interfere with the gel filtration process . sequence similarity searches with _PROTEIN_ using the blast algorithm did not convincingly identify _PROTEIN_ from bacteria or animals . however blast searches of the est databases for various crop plant species enabled us to identify clones for _PROTEIN_ from potato tomato soybean and wheat and from rice genome . these plant proteins are all very similar to one another suggesting that these have diverged from the _PROTEIN_ enzymes found in other _METHOD_ early on in evolution . the plant enzymes share identity with that from cyanobacteria . a comparison of the arabidopsis and rice _PROTEIN_ sequences with those for _PROTEIN_ enzymes from other _METHOD_ was made using the clustalw version program . mathews et al . compared the human enzyme with those of drosophila yeast and some bacteria and found seven invariant residues of which mutation in just three and affected enzyme activity . _PROTEIN_ and the other plant sequences contain all seven invariant residues and of the conserved residues . interestingly the e. coli _PROTEIN_ differs at three of the invariant positions including . when a structure based search was carried out with _PROTEIN_ on the structures in the pdb using the program _PROTEIN_ the top hit was that for human _PROTEIN_ with a z score of . this demonstrates that despite a lack of primary sequence conservation the structural elements of the protein have been conserved . as mentioned above the one striking difference between the plant enzymes and those from other species is an n terminal extension which is rich in hydroxylated residues suggesting that it was a chloroplast transit peptide . analysis of the arabidopsis sequence by chlorop strongly predicted a _LOCATION_ location for the protein with a probable cleavage site after residues . we investigated this experimentally using an import assay in vitro and _METHOD_ fusion proteins in vivo . for the import assay in vitro chloroplasts were isolated from day old pea shoots as described in the experimental section and incubated with radiolabelled _PROTEIN_ precursor . upon incubation with purified chloroplasts the kda precursor was processed to a smaller mature protein of approx . kda . the size difference would correspond to a loss of approx . residues from the n terminus rather than the predicted amino acids . the reason for this discrepancy is unknown but the most probable explanation is that the protein runs anomalously on _PROTEIN_ . as mentioned above we attempted to overexpress a form of _PROTEIN_ in e. coli in which the first amino acids were removed but this proved to be toxic to the cells . when the chloroplasts were treated with thermolysin the mature protein was protected from proteolytic degradation indicating that it was enclosed within the chloroplasts . the mature protein was found _PROTEIN_ in the stroma although a small proportion was associated with the _LOCATION_ fractions . incubation of the radiolabelled precursor protein with isolated pea mitochondria did not result in any import or processing suggesting that the protein is only targeted to _LOCATION_ . to verify that the targeting of _PROTEIN_ in vitro reflected the location in vivo the entire coding sequence of _PROTEIN_ was fused in frame to the end of the coding sequence for _METHOD_ under the regulation of a cauliflower mosaic viral promoter . the _PROTEIN_ cassette was introduced into tobacco leaves via biolistic bombardment . in a transformed guard cell the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was detected in the chloroplasts but not in any other compartments . this was confirmed by the co localization of _METHOD_ and chlorophyll _METHOD_ . furthermore the distribution pattern of the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ resembled the discrete pattern displayed by a transformed cell _PROTEIN_ reca _METHOD_ fusion proteins . in contrast _METHOD_ on its own accumulated _PROTEIN_ in the cytoplasm and the nucleoplasm but was excluded from other organelles as reported previously . the absence of _PROTEIN_ from other subcellular compartments is in line with the _PROTEIN_ that the preceding enzyme _PROTEIN_ deaminase is confined to the _LOCATION_ and a similar location would be likely so as to avoid the possibility of non enzymatic cyclization of hmb to the non metabolizable type i isomer . a _PROTEIN_ enzyme coproporphyrinogen oxidase is also found only in _LOCATION_ whereas activity of the last two enzymes of haem synthesis protoporphyrinogen oxidase and ferrochelatase can be detected in plant mitochondria where they presumably contribute to haem biosynthesis in that organelle . the plethora of genome sequences provide a tremendous resource for gene identification but in some cases limited sequence conservation between homologous proteins requires alternative experimental approaches to the use of sequence similarity searches . _LOCATION_ in initial genome annotation can also confound gene discovery . in contrast functional complementation overcomes these difficulties both in initial isolation and in the verification of genes found from database searching . however there are pitfalls to this approach as well since complementation of a mutant phenotype can occur via a different route . as an example in mammals fungi and the subgroup of proteobacteria such as rhodobacter and rhizobium spp. the initial tetrapyrrole precursor ala is synthesized from succinyl coa and glycine by the enzyme ala synthase whereas in plants algae and most bacteria ala is derived from glutamate . nevertheless mouse ala synthase rescues the e. coli hema mutant and plants defective in ala synthesis were complemented by the ala synthase gene from yeast . for the _PROTEIN_ cdna from arabidopsis that we isolated by functional complementation its identity was verified by enzyme activity of the recombinant protein . the identification of the plant gene for _PROTEIN_ opens up the way to study the role of this enzyme in the plant pathway positioned as it is at an important branchpoint .
