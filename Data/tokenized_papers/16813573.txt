_LOCATION_ biogenesis requires various complex processes including organelle division enlargement and protein transport . we have been studying a number of arabidopsis apm mutants that display aberrant _LOCATION_ morphology . two of these mutants _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ showed green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ in the _LOCATION_ as well as in _LOCATION_ indicating a _PROTEIN_ of efficiency of _LOCATION_ targeting signal _PROTEIN_ dependent protein transport to _LOCATION_ . interestingly both mutants were defective in _PROTEIN_ dependent protein transport . plant growth was more inhibited in _PROTEIN_ than _PROTEIN_ mutants apparently because protein transport was more severely _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ than in _PROTEIN_ mutants . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were found to encode proteins homologous to the peroxins _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ respectively which are thought to be involved in transporting _PROTEIN_ proteins into _LOCATION_ in yeasts and mammals . we show that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are localized on peroxisomal _LOCATION_ and that _PROTEIN_ interacts with _PROTEIN_ a _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ receptor . additionally a _PROTEIN_ receptor _PROTEIN_ was found to stall on peroxisomal _LOCATION_ in both mutants suggesting that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are components that are involved in protein transport on peroxisomal _LOCATION_ in higher plants . proteins homologous to _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ have previously been found in arabidopsis but it is not known whether they are involved in protein transport to _LOCATION_ . our findings reveal that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are responsible for _PROTEIN_ protein import to _LOCATION_ in planta .
a number of apm mutants were previously identified based on the different pattern of green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ _METHOD_ from a parent plant . two of these mutants _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ displayed _METHOD_ _METHOD_ in the _LOCATION_ as well as in _LOCATION_ whereas the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ plant as a parent plant exhibited _METHOD_ _METHOD_ in _LOCATION_ but not in the _LOCATION_ . since _METHOD_ is transported into _LOCATION_ via a _PROTEIN_ dependent pathway the presence of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ in the _LOCATION_ suggests a _PROTEIN_ in the efficiency of protein transport through this pathway in both mutants . the pattern of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ is different between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants . in _PROTEIN_ the _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ is very faint in the cells of almost all tissues . however the _LOCATION_ around the _LOCATION_ in the trichome and stomata is strongly labelled so that it is easier to find stomata in _PROTEIN_ mutants than the parent plant _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . _LOCATION_ are still observed as spherical spots in almost cells in _PROTEIN_ mutants . an electron microscopic analysis showed that the number and size of _LOCATION_ are almost the same as in the parent plant _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ which suggests that the effect of _PROTEIN_ mutation is weak . in _PROTEIN_ mutants the _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ is strong in almost all cells and there are fewer _LOCATION_ . the pattern of _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ in _PROTEIN_ mutants varies with the tissue and the stage of development . that is _METHOD_ _METHOD_ in cotyledons except stomata is almost completely in the _LOCATION_ and spherical spots are hardly observed compared with other tissues . in the stomata _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was observed in the _LOCATION_ and in _LOCATION_ as was the case for _PROTEIN_ mutants but unlike the _LOCATION_ of _PROTEIN_ mutants the _LOCATION_ of _PROTEIN_ mutants are larger and fewer in number compared with the parent plant _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . we found that young cotyledons and root tips contain many _LOCATION_ as does the parent plant _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and that the number of _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ and the _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ becomes stronger with each stage of development . in addition clusters of _LOCATION_ were observed in the lower position of roots in _PROTEIN_ mutants but not in _PROTEIN_ mutants . these patterns of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ were also observed in the next generation of both mutants . our observations indicate that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are involved in _PROTEIN_ dependent protein transport in a manner dependent on the type of tissue and the developmental stage . both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants show a repression of plant growth compared with the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ plant . growth repression was more severe in _PROTEIN_ mutants than in _PROTEIN_ mutants . in addition the establishment frequency of _PROTEIN_ mutants was similar to the level of the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ plant whereas about of _PROTEIN_ seeds were unable to germinate and another of _PROTEIN_ seeds were unable to expand cotyledons even when they could germinate . these phenotypes in both mutants seemed to be related to the frequency of appearance of _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . oilseed plants such as arabidopsis reserve lipids as storage substrates for the production of sucrose through _PROTEIN_ during germination . fatty acids which are produced by the reaction of lipases in lipid bodies are transported to _LOCATION_ where they are metabolized to succinate by oxidation and the glyoxylate cycle . therefore oxidation has a vital role in producing sucrose for post germinative growth and mutants defective in peroxisomal oxidation are unable to germinate on a medium without sucrose . although _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants were able to germinate on a medium without sucrose the root length of both mutants especially the _PROTEIN_ mutants was shorter than that of the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ parent plant . as another assay of oxidation we analysed growth on a medium with dichlorophenoxybutyric acid . dichlorophenoxybutyric acid is metabolized to the herbicide dichlorophenoxyacetic acid by the action of oxidation . accordingly the growth of wild type plants is inhibited on a medium with db whereas the growth of oxidation defective mutants is not . the root length of _PROTEIN_ mutants is slightly longer than that of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ plants on medium with db . in contrast _PROTEIN_ mutants like the oxidation defective mutant _PROTEIN_ was completely resistant to db . these results show that the activity for oxidation is slightly _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ mutants and markedly _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ mutants . proteins containing _PROTEIN_ are translated as high molecular weight precursor proteins in the _LOCATION_ and then transported into _LOCATION_ where the amino terminal extension sequence containing _PROTEIN_ is cleaved . figure shows the developmental changes of ketoacyl coa thiolase a _PROTEIN_ containing protein . the precursor proteins are hardly detected in the wild type plants so that only mature proteins were detected in the extract from _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ plants whereas _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants contained the high molecular weight precursor proteins in addition to the mature proteins . this shows that _PROTEIN_ dependent protein transport is also disturbed in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants . however we are not able to exclude the possibility that the precursor thiolase protein exists in _LOCATION_ and is simply not processed because of the possibility that the unidentified enzyme which is responsible for processing the precursor thiolase was also not imported properly into the _LOCATION_ . to investigate this possibility the fusion gene which consisted of _METHOD_ with _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ transiently in both mutant cells . when _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was _PROTEIN_ in _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ plant as the parent plant red _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was observed as spherical spots and perfectly merged with _METHOD_ labelled _LOCATION_ . in the case of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants the _METHOD_ signal was observed in the _LOCATION_ as well as in _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . the pattern of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ for _PROTEIN_ dependent transport was as same as that of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ for _PROTEIN_ dependent protein transport . these results show that the _PROTEIN_ dependent protein transport is also disturbed in both mutants and that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ proteins are involved in both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ dependent protein transport . the _PROTEIN_ that the precursor proteins were more abundant in _PROTEIN_ mutants than in _PROTEIN_ mutants is consistent with the pattern of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and the repression of plant growth . each _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutation segregates as a monogenic recessive gene . mapped based cloning revealed that the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ genes are located on chromosome . we examined the nucleotide sequences in these regions in the arabidopsis genome sequence project and identified _GENE_ and _GENE_ as possible candidates for the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ genes respectively which encode proteins homologous to _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ proteins in other _METHOD_ . we found single nucleotide substitutions on _GENE_ in _PROTEIN_ which created a termination codon and _GENE_ in _PROTEIN_ which caused an arginine to be changed to a lysine residue . _PROTEIN_ contains a src homology domain which is known to mediate protein protein interactions . the _PROTEIN_ mutant has a nonsense mutation at the codon which normally encodes a glutamine residue in this domain . _PROTEIN_ has a putative _PROTEIN_ finger motif with five conserved cysteine residues in its _PROTEIN_ terminal domain . these cysteine residues are highly conserved in arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ . however the _PROTEIN_ mutation was not in this _PROTEIN_ finger motif . arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ like other _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ contain two putative transmembrane domains and their hydropathy profiles are markedly similar to those of other _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ proteins . to confirm that we had identified the correct genes the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants were transformed with _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ respectively . as shown in figure _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was observed in _LOCATION_ of plants of _PROTEIN_ transformed with _PROTEIN_ and in _LOCATION_ of plants of _PROTEIN_ transformed with _PROTEIN_ in contrast to the _LOCATION_ location in both mutants . the same results were obtained when _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ cdnas were _PROTEIN_ in an _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ background respectively under the control of constitutive promoter from cauliflower mosaic virus . in addition the complementation of each mutant recovered the phenotype of plant growth as shown in figure . that is plants of _PROTEIN_ transformed with _PROTEIN_ and plants of _PROTEIN_ transformed with _PROTEIN_ were able to germinate on a medium without sucrose and exhibited sensitivity to db as did _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ plants and almost all the plants of _PROTEIN_ transformed with _PROTEIN_ showed normal seedling establishment . these results demonstrate that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are able to complement _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutations respectively showing that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ respectively . to determine the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ we generated affinity purified antibodies against the amino terminal fragment of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . these antibodies detected a kda band which is consistent with the deduced molecular _METHOD_ of _PROTEIN_ in the extracts from the transgenic plants overexpressing _PROTEIN_ transcripts under the control of the promoter from cauliflower mosaic virus in an _PROTEIN_ background cross reactive bands were absent in the wild type and _PROTEIN_ plants . we believe that the amount of _PROTEIN_ in cells of wild type plants is too low to be detected . in yeast cells the amount of _PROTEIN_ is very low so that overexpression was necessary for detection . we examined the association of _PROTEIN_ with peroxisomal _LOCATION_ by fractionation of total cell extracts into soluble and _LOCATION_ fractions . catalase and _METHOD_ which are transported into the peroxisomal _PROTEIN_ were present exclusively in the soluble fraction whereas one of the peroxisomal _LOCATION_ proteins _PROTEIN_ was predominantly in the _LOCATION_ fraction although a minor portion was present in the soluble fraction under our conditions . _PROTEIN_ was found only in the _LOCATION_ fraction . it was not found in the soluble fraction even when double amounts of soluble proteins were applied to _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . these results indicate that _PROTEIN_ is tightly associated with _LOCATION_ . these results together with the data obtained by transient _PROTEIN_ analysis confirm that _PROTEIN_ is localized on peroxisomal _LOCATION_ . we were unable to obtain good antibodies against _PROTEIN_ to investigate its suborganellar localization . in another approach we simultaneously introduced the constructs of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ into arabidopsis root cells by particle bombardment . in bombarded cells _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was transported into the peroxisomal _PROTEIN_ and _LOCATION_ were visualized as spherical red spots . when _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ were _PROTEIN_ simultaneously as a control peroxisomal _PROTEIN_ was labelled with both _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ . green signals from the peroxisomal _PROTEIN_ were observed as spherical spots and merged perfectly with _METHOD_ derived signals . however the green signals from _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were observed as _PROTEIN_ like structures and these structures surrounded the _METHOD_ labelled peroxisomal _PROTEIN_ suggesting that _PROTEIN_ is localized on peroxisomal _LOCATION_ . we obtained the same result using _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in which _METHOD_ was fused in front of _PROTEIN_ showing that the position of _METHOD_ in the chimeric protein does not disturb the transport of _PROTEIN_ to _LOCATION_ . similarly _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in which _METHOD_ was fused to the amino terminus of _PROTEIN_ was observed to form _PROTEIN_ like structures surrounding the peroxisomal _PROTEIN_ . this result is in good agreement with the finding that _PROTEIN_ is a _LOCATION_ protein . however _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in which _METHOD_ was fused to the _PROTEIN_ terminus of _PROTEIN_ was observed in the _LOCATION_ but not in _LOCATION_ suggesting that masking the _PROTEIN_ terminal domain with _METHOD_ abolished the transport of _PROTEIN_ to peroxisomal _LOCATION_ . we previously reported that _PROTEIN_ is an essential receptor in both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ dependent protein transport in arabidopsis and that _PROTEIN_ acts as one component of the protein transport machinery on peroxisomal _LOCATION_ . a large amount of _PROTEIN_ was detected in the soluble fraction of the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ parent plant _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . in _PROTEIN_ mutants the pattern of distribution of _PROTEIN_ between soluble and _LOCATION_ fractions hardly changed _PROTEIN_ whereas the amount of _LOCATION_ associated _PROTEIN_ increased in _PROTEIN_ mutants _PROTEIN_ . however we can not exclude the possibility that the mutation in _PROTEIN_ affected the distribution of _PROTEIN_ because the _PROTEIN_ double mutants had increased amounts of _LOCATION_ associated _PROTEIN_ compared with the _PROTEIN_ single mutant _PROTEIN_ . this result indicates that _PROTEIN_ binds to and does not move on peroxisomal _LOCATION_ in both mutants . in contrast the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutations hardly alter the distribution of _PROTEIN_ although the _PROTEIN_ mutation _METHOD_ to slightly elevate the level of _PROTEIN_ and to create an additional smaller band . to investigate the potential interaction of _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ the yeast two hybrid system was employed . first we used the full length _PROTEIN_ protein but did not observe any interaction . accordingly the truncated constructs with the amino terminal amino acids _PROTEIN_ or the _PROTEIN_ terminal amino acids _PROTEIN_ were generated . _PROTEIN_ interacted with _PROTEIN_ but did not interact with _PROTEIN_ . these data indicate that the amino terminal amino acids of _PROTEIN_ are capable of binding with _PROTEIN_ . however neither _PROTEIN_ nor _PROTEIN_ interacted with _PROTEIN_ under our conditions or even with extended fragments of _PROTEIN_ such as _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants were crossed to produce _PROTEIN_ double mutants to identify the interaction of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ that takes place in protein transport to _LOCATION_ . in _PROTEIN_ double mutants _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was observed in the _LOCATION_ and in _LOCATION_ as it was in each parent plant . the _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ in the double mutant seemed to be more intense than that in _PROTEIN_ mutants . however the size of the _LOCATION_ in the double mutants is the same as that in _PROTEIN_ mutants . spherical spots showing _LOCATION_ were more abundant in the double mutants than in the _PROTEIN_ mutants although the intensity of _METHOD_ is lower than that in _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ plants . in addition the clusters of _LOCATION_ observed in the _PROTEIN_ root cells were hardly detectable in the double mutants . these observations show that the pattern of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ in the double mutants is rather similar to that in _PROTEIN_ mutants suggesting that _PROTEIN_ acts upstream of _PROTEIN_ in the process of _PROTEIN_ protein transport . the growth of the double mutants was more severely inhibited than the growth of the single mutants . in addition the rate of germination was also markedly reduced in the double mutants and the cotyledons of double mutant plants become yellow green at an earlier stage than each single mutant . this is in good agreement with the findings that the double mutants have a greater sucrose dependence during germination and a greater accumulation of precursors of ketoacyl coa thiolase . the double mutants were insensitive to db by the defect of oxidation as were _PROTEIN_ mutants . these results indicate that transport of _PROTEIN_ protein was more severely _PROTEIN_ in the double mutants .
_METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ as a parent plant and apm mutants were grown as described previously . seeds were surface sterilized in naclo plus triton x and grown on germination media _METHOD_ . germination was induced by a h incubation in the dark at followed by white light at . tissues of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ plants and apm mutants were prepared and examined using an _PROTEIN_ laser scanning confocal microscope as previously described . typically the acquisition parameters of images among plants were almost the same by using the reuse function in _PROTEIN_ software . for imaging stomata in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ double mutants the detector gain was changed because of optimization for the strong intensity of _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ . _PROTEIN_ homozygotes which were backcrossed three times with the parent plant _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ were crossed with another ecotype landsberg _LOCATION_ . a total of progenies _PROTEIN_ mutant phenotypes were scored according to their genetic background as revealed by a series of cleaved amplified polymorphic sequences and simple sequence length polymorphism markers . rough mapping revealed that the _PROTEIN_ locus is located between the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ markers on chromosome . for fine mapping we made several sets of oligonucleotide primers for caps and sslp markers according to the cereon genomics database . markers on bacterial artificial chromosome clones and indicate that the _PROTEIN_ locus is located in the region between these two bac clones . examination of the nucleotide sequences in this region in the arabidopsis genome sequence project identified _GENE_ as a candidate . based on this nucleotide sequence we designed a set of oligonucleotide primers that could amplify the predicted gene by pcr . the dna fragments corresponding to this region were amplified from the genomic dnas of a _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ plant and the _PROTEIN_ mutant using the same primer set and were fully sequenced . the strategy for mapped based cloning of the _PROTEIN_ locus is the same as stated above . a total of progenies _PROTEIN_ mutant phenotypes were scored . rough mapping revealed that the _PROTEIN_ locus is located between the _PROTEIN_ and markers on chromosome . fine mapping indicated that the _PROTEIN_ locus is located in the region between the and bac clones . _GENE_ was identified as a candidate gene from an examination of the nucleotide sequences in this region . the dna fragments corresponding to this gene were amplified from the genomic dnas of the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ plant and the _PROTEIN_ mutant

fragments were inserted into the noti sali or kpni xhoi sites on and then the insert was transferred to the binary vector by an lr recombination reaction using gateway technology . the vectors containing the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ genes designated and respectively were then transformed into agrobacterium tumefaciens by electroporation . arabidopsis was transformed by the infiltration method . transformants were selected on a medium containing hygromycin . a dna fragment encoding from the first methionine to the amino acid residue of _PROTEIN_ conjugated to bamhi and hindiii sites at the and ends respectively was amplified by pcr using _PROTEIN_ cdna as a template . the amplified dna was digested with bamhi and hindiii and inserted into the vector . a _PROTEIN_ and his tag fusion protein was synthesized in escherichia coli cells purified and used for production of rabbit antibodies against _PROTEIN_ as described previously . arabidopsis leaves were harvested from the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ plants and _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants . ultrathin sectioning microscopic analysis and immunogold labelling were done as described previously . the _METHOD_ cdna fragment was generated by the addition of the nucleotide sequence containing sali saci spei smai mlui and ncoi sites at the end and the nucleotide sequence containing bglii kpni xhoi clai at the end . this _METHOD_ cdna fragment was inserted behind the promoter from cauliflower mosaic virus in pth . this plasmid was designated . the _METHOD_ cdna fragment in was replaced with an _METHOD_ cdna fragment which was kindly provided by dr roger tsien . this construct was designated as . bglii and sali sites were introduced into the flanking region of the initiation codon and on either side of the stop codon in _PROTEIN_ cdna respectively by pcr . the bglii sali fragment was inserted into the bglii xhoi site of yielding _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . the sali mlui fragment whose sites were introduced into the and ends of _PROTEIN_ cdna by pcr was inserted into the sali mlui site of yielding _METHOD_ . to generate _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ the kpni xhoi fragment or sali mlui sites were introduced into the and ends of _PROTEIN_ cdna by pcr . then the kpni xhoi fragment or sali mlui fragments were inserted into . a dna fragment encoding the _PROTEIN_ five amino acids of arabidopsis hydroxypyruvate reductase was inserted into the bglii xhoi site of . this construct was designated . a dna fragment encoding the amino terminal amino acid residues of pumpkin citrate synthase which was conjugated at the and sites at the and ends respectively was amplified by pcr . the pcr amplified fragments were cloned into the entry vector by a _PROTEIN_ recombination reaction . the insert was transferred to the transient _PROTEIN_ vector which contains the _METHOD_ gene by an lr recombination reaction . the vector designated _METHOD_ was then introduced into root cells of transgenic arabidopsis _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ which _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ targeted _METHOD_ with a helios gene gun according to the manufacturer 's instructions . the cells were bombarded with gold particles at a helium pressure of bar . after bombardment tissues were incubated on _METHOD_ plates for h at and were observed under a _PROTEIN_ confocal laser scanning microscope . _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ or _METHOD_ was introduced simultaneously with into root cells of wild type arabidopsis under the same conditions as stated above . _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ which _PROTEIN_ a fusion protein consisting of _METHOD_ with _PROTEIN_ was introduced simultaneously with into epidermal cells as a control . for extraction of total proteins arabidopsis cotyledons grown to various stages were homogenized with extraction buffer _PROTEIN_ and then the homogenates were centrifuged at g for min at . _LOCATION_ were fractionated as described previously with slight modifications . briefly the aerial parts of arabidopsis plants grown for days were homogenized with buffer a and then centrifuged at g for min at to separate into soluble and _LOCATION_ fractions . the _LOCATION_ fractions were lysed in buffer b and centrifuged at g for min at again . the protein content of each extract was estimated by using a protein assay kit with bovine gamma albumin as a standard protein . proteins were separated by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ on a polyacrylamide gel and transferred to a nylon _LOCATION_ or a pvdf _LOCATION_ in a semidry electroblotting system . immunological reactions were detected by monitoring the activity of horseradish peroxidase coupled antibodies against rabbit igg . proteins on a pvdf _LOCATION_ were visualized with _METHOD_ brilliant blue r to verify the loading of the lane . the two hybrid analysis was carried out according to the method described previously . the tested genes were fused to the dna binding domain or activation domain in the vectors pgbd or pgad . to construct various lengths of dna fragments encoding the truncated _PROTEIN_ dna fragments conjugated at the bamhi and sali sites were amplified by pcr . after digestion with bamhi and sali dna fragments were inserted into the bamhi and sali sites on pgbd and pgad and then sequenced to confirm that no mutation was introduced . the two hybrid vectors were co transformed into tester strain according to an established protocol .

using and lacz reporters .
