we have characterized a new gene _PROTEIN_ involved in sister chromatid cohesion during both male and female meiosis inarabidopsis thaliana . a first allele _PROTEIN_ was obtained as a t dna tagged mutant and was described previously as abnormal exclusively in female meiosis . we have isolated a new allele _PROTEIN_ which is defective for both male and female meiosis . male meiosis the classical steps of prophase were not observed especially because homologs do not synapse . chromatid _METHOD_ and centromeres lost their cohesion in a stepwise manner before metaphase i and chromatids instead of five bivalents were seen at the metaphase plate which was followed by an aberrant segregation . in contrast _PROTEIN_ female meiocytes performed a mitotic like division instead of meiosis indicating a distinct role for _PROTEIN_ or a different effect of the loss of _PROTEIN_ function in both processes . gene was cloned the putative _PROTEIN_ protein did not show strong similarity to any known protein . plants transformed with a _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion indicated that _PROTEIN_ protein is present in meiocyte _LOCATION_ before meiosis and at a very early stage of prophase . thus _PROTEIN_ appears to be a novel protein involved in chromatid cohesion establishment and in chromosome structure during meiosis but with clear differences between male and female meiosis .
to identify sterile mutants a. thaliana lines generated by chemical mutagenesis were screened . seventeen lines were found to be altered in fertility and among them seven complementation groups of meiotic mutants were obtained . one of these lines showed complete sterility with nonelongated siliques containing no seed . the mutation was found to be sporophytically _PROTEIN_ monogenic and recessive because the phenotype segregation fits a fertile/sterile plant ratio . a complementation test with the previously isolated _PROTEIN_ t dna mutant was performed by crossing plants heterozygous for the _PROTEIN_ with male fertile homozygous _PROTEIN_ . the segregated with a ratio indicating that this new mutant was allelic to _PROTEIN_ it was therefore called _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ mutant did not show any developmental abnormality other than nonelongated siliques . the previously described _PROTEIN_ mutant was isolated from a t dna mutagenized a. thaliana collection . only one t dna has been integrated in _PROTEIN_ mutant . a bp fragment flanking the left border of the t dna was isolated by inverse pcr experiment . this fragment was then used to screen ana . thaliana genomic dna library and a kb dna fragment that spanned the insertion region was isolated . the kb fragment was sequenced and found to be identical to a part of the chromosome clone . a bpsali/spei dna fragment was found to restore the wild type phenotype when transformed into the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants . this result confirmed the allelism and _PROTEIN_ mutants and identified gene . the coding region composed of seven exons was defined using rt pcr experiments . the and ends of the transcript were cloned using rapid amplification of cdna ends _PROTEIN_ . three clones were obtained after _PROTEIN_ experiments defining a bp noncoding sequence after the stop codon . _PROTEIN_ experiments with primer produced five clones defining a transcription start bp before a putative translation start site . the presence of a stop codon in this utr suggested that the cdna was full length . interestingly using primer for _PROTEIN_ we obtained seven clones which indicated the position of a second transcription start in intron ii bp of exon iii . the exon patterns of the long and short _PROTEIN_ transcripts are shown in figure . the two defined transcripts encode and a amino acid polypeptides respectively with a predicted molecular _METHOD_ of and kd . a region of the _PROTEIN_ protein is predicted to form a coiled coil from aa to aa _PROTEIN_ . a potential _LOCATION_ localization signal rkrk was found . comparison of _PROTEIN_ protein with sequences in databases using blastp with filters for areas of low complexity detected no strong similarity with any known proteins . nevertheless restrained similarities were found with diverse proteins including a limited similarity with a region of a smc _PROTEIN_ family protein . this region is highly conserved between human mouse and bos taurus _PROTEIN_ . southern blot experiments indicated that the t dna inserted mutant was truncated at the right border . a kb dna fragment flanking this border of the t dna was cloned by the technique of plasmid rescue . this kb clone and the bp i pcr fragment described previously permitted us to define the insertion site . insertion of the truncated t dna occurred bp of the transcription start of the l transcript and was accompanied by a bp deletion of the genomic dna the bp sali/spei _PROTEIN_ genomic dna fragment was sequenced . a single base substitution was detected changing the aa sense codon into a stop codon . moreover the mutation modified a hinfi restriction site allowing us to define a caps . using primers flanking the mutation locus and the hinfi restriction site we were able to differentiate _PROTEIN_ from a / genotype which are both fertile . _PROTEIN_ of the two transcripts was measured in buds of the two mutants and in wild type by rt pcr using primers designed at exon junctions to avoid amplification of genomic dna contamination . the longer transcript was specifically amplified using primers and whereas primers and amplified both l and s transcripts . unfortunately it was not possible to design primers from the sequence specific to the s transcript . the long transcript and the sum of the two transcripts were detected in the _PROTEIN_ mutant at a similar level to that of wild type . therefore the presence of a stop codon in the middle of the transcript does not affect its transcription level . in the _PROTEIN_ mutant overexpression was found . this result was unexpected because the mutation is recessive . the sequencing of a cdna fragment amplified using primers and showed that this _PROTEIN_ is the result of a transcriptional fusion between the uida inverted open reading frame and gene . this fusion was not translated however because stop codons are present in the three reading frames before the correct _PROTEIN_ translation start . the only way that _PROTEIN_ can be synthesized would be by reinitiation of translation and this would be expected to produce only low level of the _PROTEIN_ protein . in plants meiosis does not directly produce gametes but spores . these spores then undergo haploid mitotic divisions to produce the gametophytes which contain the gametes . male meiosis and gametogenesis occur in anthers producing the pollen grain . the female organ the pistil contains ovules . each mature ovule is composed of three parts the embryo sac the funicule which attaches the ovule to the pistil and the integuments which progressively surround the developing embryo sac . in a previous study the _PROTEIN_ mutant was shown to be affected exclusively in female meiosis and the subsequent gametogenesis . in contrast _PROTEIN_ was found to be affected in both male and female sexual processes because no seed was produced after self fertilization or after reciprocal crosses with wild type plants . to define the cause of the male and female sterility in the _PROTEIN_ mutant we examined different developmental stages of anthers and ovules . figure shows a wild type anther containing tetrads of spores the results of male meiosis . anthers male meiocytes have an aberrant shape and subsequently degenerate . in mature wild type anther viable pollen grains were stained by the alexander method whereas _PROTEIN_ mature anthers contained no pollen grains . in the female tissues a meiocyte differentiates in each wild type ovule . meiosis occurs synchronously with integument initiation . immediately after meiosis three out of the four spores degenerate . the one remaining the functional megaspore will proceed through gametogenesis and will generate the mature embryo sac . in _PROTEIN_ ovules early development is similar to that of wild type with synchronous meiocyte differentiation and integuments initiation . at a postmeiotic developmental stage of _PROTEIN_ ovules contained an undivided cell and showed a _PROTEIN_ instead of a tetrad . at a more advanced developmental stage ovules contained one two or four/five cells of unequal size . at the end of ovule development degenerated cells were observed instead of the embryo sac . to investigate chromosome structure in the _PROTEIN_ mutant we prepared dapi stained spreads of male meiocytes . in wild type the chromosomes appeared as threads at leptotene underwent synapsis at zygotene and were fully synapsed at pachytene . the five resulting bivalents condensed _PROTEIN_ and arranged at the metaphase plate . bivalents segregated into their univalents at anaphase i then the univalents arranged at the metaphase ii plate and segregated their chromatids to form four sets of five chromatids . the first detectable abnormality in _PROTEIN_ mutant was the diffuse aspect of leptotene chromosomes . chromosomes condensed but did not undergo leptotene zygotene and diakinesis stages . no signs of synapsis or _PROTEIN_ were detected through > cells observed at each stage shown in figure and . the absence of synapsis led to the presence of univalents instead of bivalents at prometaphase . then chromatid _METHOD_ and centromeres lost their cohesion in a stepwise manner before the end of metaphase i leading first to x formed univalents indicating that their centromere were still attached and second to well separated chromatids . therefore only chromatids were seen at metaphase i which segregated randomly as shown in figure . this phenotype denotes a strong defect in sister chromatid cohesion . the timing of chromosome condensation _METHOD_ to be affected in _PROTEIN_ chromosomes are still poorly condensed when chromatid cohesion is lost . unfortunately it is very difficult to effectively compare this timing because no marker of prophase substages is available . however low condensation _LOCATION_ are frequently observed denoting a general delay in prophase . to investigate how the segregation of the chromatids occurred we performed double staining to visualize both dna and microtubules . in wild type meiosis microtubules surround the _LOCATION_ at diakinesis . the spindle is formed in prometaphase and at anaphase i microtubules pull homologs to opposite poles . the two anaphase ii spindles allow sister chromatids separation and finally chromatids decondense . figure shows the chromosomes of prophase _LOCATION_ . at _PROTEIN_ metaphase i/anaphase i a large spindle surrounded the separated chromatids . chromatids were more or less well arranged on the metaphase plate probably because of small variations in the timing of release of sister chromatid cohesion and spindle formation . a subsequent random chromatid segregation produced the unbalanced segregation shown in figures and . the second division spindles were totally disorganized leading to the formation of a variable number of _LOCATION_ from to containing unequal amounts of chromatids . male meiosis is completely normal in a _PROTEIN_ mutant but is strongly affected in _PROTEIN_ . to understand this allelic effect of _PROTEIN_ mutations on male meiosis we plants . these plants showed reduced pollen grain production which was an intermediate phenotype compared with the two homozygous mutants . dapi stained spreads of male meiocytes revealed that of them performed wild type meiosis . the remaining meiocytes showed unusual division pattern . at diakinesis and metaphase i chromosomes could be observed . these figures are interpreted as being a patchwork of univalents and bivalents . this interpretation was confirmed by observations at early anaphase i . in figure at least two segregating bivalents and univalents could be seen . anaphase i produces two sets of chromosomes composed of chromatids and univalents . note that chromatids are indistinguishable from univalents but the chromosome number in figure denotes the presence of three univalents . two examples of metaphase ii are shown in . the cell to the left in figure was the result of the separation of four bivalents and two univalents at anaphase i. bivalents and univalents present at metaphase i separated respectively their homologs or their sister chromatids simultaneously at anaphase i . the four univalents coming from the separation of the four bivalents at anaphase i were able to form a metaphase ii plate in each daughter cell two chromatids are unable to join the metaphase plate . the cell to the right in figure could result from the separation of one bivalent and eight univalents because a univalent could be identified because of its alignment on the metaphase plate and eight chromatids are seen in each daughter cell . during the second division the univalents separated into the two chromatids but the single chromatids segregated randomly . to summarize in _PROTEIN_ male meiocytes a patchwork of bivalents and univalents was observed at metaphase i. bivalents segregated their chromosomes at anaphase i and then their chromatids at anaphase ii whereas univalents segregated their chromatids equally at anaphase i and these chromatids segregated randomly at anaphase ii . nevertheless in some cases the first segregation was unbalanced as shown in figure . in the upper daughter cell chromatids of which two form a univalent can be counted . two hypotheses could explain this unequal result . first a univalent present at metaphase i may have migrated to one pole of the cell without separating its chromatids . second this univalent might have separated its chromatids precociously as in the _PROTEIN_ mutant and these chromatids then segregated randomly to the same pole of the cell . female meiocytes were observed using propidium iodide staining and confocal laser scanning microscopy . in wild type five bivalents were observed on the metaphase plate and segregated into two sets of five univalents . univalents separated their chromatids resulting into four equilibrated cells . at _PROTEIN_ prometaphase univalents were observed . these univalents were always observed aligned on an well organized metaphase plate . meiocytes then performed an equilibrated division . in daughter cells observed at the same stage unequilibrated segregation was never seen . despite the limitation of the resolution of this technique each of them _METHOD_ to contain chromosomes . we concluded that this division is a mitotic like division but we can not rule out that this segregation can sometimes be imperfectly equational . these data are in agreement with the equilibrated _PROTEIN_ shown in figure and j . these daughter cells then entered interphase and performed a second division . two different scenarios were then observed . either the daughter cells proceeded to a complete including s phase second mitosis like division univalents regrouped on a metaphase plate and performed a perfect separation of sister chromatids as it is clearly seen in figure and on the corresponding three dimensional reconstructions . alternatively the daughter cell performed an aberrant second division . chromosomes did not unit on a clear metaphase plate and segregation was unequal . it is possible that in this subset of cells imperfectly equilibrated segregation could have occurred during the first division leading to an aberrant second division . the result of these divisions was a variable number of daughter cells with variable size . the defects in male and female meiosis induced mutation were therefore clearly different . the cytological localization of _PROTEIN_ was determined using a green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ tagged version of the protein . the construct when introduced into _PROTEIN_ mutant restored the fertile phenotype . _METHOD_ staining was exclusively detected in female and male meiocyte _LOCATION_ in fresh or fixed tissues . figure and b shows an ovule and an anther at the developmental stage of meiosis _METHOD_ . _METHOD_ was detected in the _LOCATION_ of meiocytes exclusively at this stage . figure f shows isolated propidium iodide stained male meiocytes . the red color indicated the stained dna which includes genomic _LOCATION_ and mitochondrial dna . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein was present in the _LOCATION_ of premeiotic meiocytes . these _LOCATION_ distinguishable by the presence of diffuse chromatin and a central nucleolus may correspond to meiotic _PROTEIN_ s or _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ in very early leptotene the _METHOD_ staining colocalized with genomic dna indicating that is a chromosomal associated protein . note that the _METHOD_ signal did not colocalize with cytoplasmic dna . _METHOD_ staining was absent when chromosomes became individually distinguishable at leptotene and was undetectable _PROTEIN_ in meiosis .

be transformed . we transformed the fertile descendants plants with a segregation that is two and one third / . using a caps marker two independent transformed lines were shown to have or _PROTEIN_ genotype and were completely fertile . it is not possible to distinguish between these two genotypes because of the wild type _PROTEIN_ gene introduced by the transformation . if the introduced fragment was not responsible for this fertility these plants would have to be _PROTEIN_ and the fertility/sterility character would segregate in self fertilized plants with a ratio . however this ratio was respectively and which would only be the case if the introduced fragment restored the fertility in _PROTEIN_ plants . using primers flanking the mutation locus _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and hinfi
