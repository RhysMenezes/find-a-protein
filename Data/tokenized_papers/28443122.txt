_PROTEIN_ constitute a major group of natural metabolites represented by three major classes of more than chemical structures . in our previous work soluble proteins and metabolites in arabidopsis mutants deficient of aliphatic _PROTEIN_ and indolic gls _PROTEIN_ were analyzed . here we focus on investigating the changes at the level of _LOCATION_ proteins in these mutants . our _METHOD_ _METHOD_ analyses of tandem _METHOD_ tag labeled peptides derived from the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ relative to wild type resulted in the identification of proteins from which are _LOCATION_ proteins . fold changes and statistical analysis showed increased and _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ while increased and _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ . as to the shared protein changes between the mutants one protein was increased and eight were _PROTEIN_ . bioinformatics analysis of the changed proteins led to the discovery of three cytochromes in _PROTEIN_ molecular network cytochrome cytochrome and probable cytochrome c . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ may play a role in hydroxyl indolic gls production . in addition flavone o methyltransferase represents an interesting finding as it is likely to participate in the methylation process of the hydroxyl indolic gls to form methoxy indolic gls . the analysis also revealed additional new nodes in the gmn related to stress and defense activity transport photosynthesis and translation processes . gene _PROTEIN_ and protein levels were found to be correlated in the _PROTEIN_ but not in the _PROTEIN_ .
based on the _METHOD_ spectra of high confidence peptides derived from the wt _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ we identified proteins in two independent experiments using proteome discover . out of these proteins were identified in both experiments while and were unique to experiments and respectively . a total of proteins were available for quantification based on unique tmt labeled peptides highlighting the high efficiency of labeling . pd enrichment analysis of the identified proteins showed to be _LOCATION_ proteins . comparative analysis of the protein _PROTEIN_ changes between the mutants and wt at a fold change cutoff a p < and transmembrane domain analysis revealed proteins to be increased and to be _PROTEIN_ . transmembrane domain analysis revealed that out of the differentially _PROTEIN_ proteins contained at least one transmembrane domains . the rest deemed to be _LOCATION_ associated proteins . correlating the changed proteins to those involved in gls metabolism using _PROTEIN_ showed new nodes and edges . the new nodes can be categorized according to their positions in the network as directly correlated or indirectly correlated to gls metabolism .

indolic gls metabolism affected a group of stress related _LOCATION_ proteins forming new secondary nodes . representative examples from this group are calmodulin like protein _PROTEIN_ mediator of rna polymerase ii transcription subunit homologous protein _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ dynamin related protein _PROTEIN_ protein ilityhia _PROTEIN_ glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase _PROTEIN_ l ascorbate

_PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in addition to the _LOCATION_ associated protein _PROTEIN_ . as we detected a side network correlated to indolic gmn here we also found a side network strongly correlated to indolic gls metabolism as it contains nine stress related proteins out of eleven . these proteins are xyloglucan endotransglucosylase/hydrolase protein _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ aquaporin _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ probable aquaporin _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ aquaporin _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ probable aquaporin _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_

tmhmm . agrigo enrichment analysis of the changed proteins was conducted at the biological processes _PROTEIN_ cellular components and molecular functions levels . by annotating changed _LOCATION_ proteins in the _PROTEIN_ using _PROTEIN_ we got enriched go _METHOD_ for _PROTEIN_ for cc and for mf . _PROTEIN_ of changed _LOCATION_ proteins in the _PROTEIN_ showed enriched go _METHOD_ for _PROTEIN_ for cc and for mf . _PROTEIN_ of the mutant revealed _PROTEIN_ cc and mf go _METHOD_ to be enriched specifically in _PROTEIN_ while _PROTEIN_ cc and one mf were the specifically enriched go _METHOD_ in _PROTEIN_ . from this _PROTEIN_ analysis it was obvious that responses to stimuli including abiotic chemical and stress were highly enriched in _PROTEIN_ in addition to transport photosynthesis and metabolic processes . in _PROTEIN_ the most enriched _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were those related to translation process . this observation supported our results concerning the stimuli and translation related proteins in the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ respectively . on the level of cc the high enrichment of _LOCATION_ go _METHOD_ supported the effectiveness of our _LOCATION_ preparation procedure . to determine whether protein level changes correlated with gene transcription changes we examined the transcript levels of and genes from _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ respectively . the two mutants exhibited different patterns of correlation . in comparison of _PROTEIN_ to wt the genes investigated showed a positive correlation between transcript and protein levels in both direction and degree of _PROTEIN_ . however in comparison of _PROTEIN_ to wt the genes did not show correlation between the transcript and protein levels only three out of the genes showed similar regulation at both transcript and protein levels . for example encoding cytochrome exhibited down regulation in _PROTEIN_ compared to wt . the difference in the degree of correlation in these two mutants implies that different regulatory _METHOD_ are involved in the transcriptional and posttranscriptional processes in different genotypes .
