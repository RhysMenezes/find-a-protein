actin filaments and microtubules are two major cytoskeletal _METHOD_ involved in wide cellular processes and the organizations of their filamentous networks are regulated by a large number of associated proteins . recently evidence has accumulated for the functional cooperation between the two filament _METHOD_ via associated proteins . however little is known about the interactions of the kinesin superfamily proteins a class of microtubule based motor proteins with actin filaments . here we describe the identification and characterization of a novel kinesin related protein named from dictyostelium . consists of an n terminal conserved motor domain a central stalk region and a c terminal tail domain . the motor domain showed binding to microtubules in an _PROTEIN_ dependent manner that is characteristic of kinesin related proteins . we found that the c terminal tail domain directly interacts with actin filaments and bundles them in vitro . _METHOD_ studies showed that is specifically enriched at the actin rich surface protrusions in cells . overexpression of the protein affected the organization of actin filaments in cells . we propose that a kinesin related protein is a novel actin bundling protein and a potential cross linker of actin filaments and microtubules associated with specific actin based structures in dictyostelium .
identification of as a kinesin related cloned and determined the full sequence of the gene from d. discoideum . fig . shows the deduced amino acid sequence of . sequence analysis showed that the gene encodes a protein with a molecular _METHOD_ of kda that consists of an n terminal kinesin motor domain a central stalk region and a c terminal tail region . the motor domain of showed the highest degree of homology with members of conventional kinesins sharing identity with neurospora kinesin and identity with human kinesin heavy chain . however outside the motor domain did not show significant homology to conventional kinesins other krps or any other proteins in the data base . the central stalk region was predicted to contain four helical coiled coil regions . two of them were predicted to contain leucine zippers corresponding to short coiled coils . because the coiled coil stalk region in the drosophila kinesin heavy chain is important for the dimerization of the protein it is likely that these multiple coiled coils and leucine zippers also facilitate the dimerization of . the nonhelical region between putative coiled coil regions from residues to is rich in asparagine and serine residues . although the significance of the amino acid clusters often found in dictyostelium is not well known a serine rich region was recently found to mediate _LOCATION_ fusion in dictyostelium cells . the c terminal tail region is rich in basic residues implying some interactions with negatively charged structures . based on the homology in the motor domain and the whole structural organization we placed as a far distant relative of conventional kinesins . however the lack of homology outside the motor domain implied the involvement of in novel cellular functions different from those of other members of conventional kinesins . the motor domains of many krps show _PROTEIN_ dependent binding to microtubules responsible for microtubule based motile activities . to characterize the microtubule binding properties of the motor domain of we first _PROTEIN_ the motor domain in e. coli cells but found that most of the _PROTEIN_ protein was insoluble or inactive . therefore we _PROTEIN_ the first residues of as a fusion with _METHOD_ in dictyostelium cells _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . the protein included the motor domain and a part of the putative coiled coil regions with _METHOD_ at the c terminus but not the tail domain to exclude the possibility that the tail domain may have inhibitory effects on the activities of the motor domain . extracts of cells _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ were incubated with microtubules in the presence of mm amppnp and centrifuged to precipitate microtubules with bound _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . about of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was found in the microtubule pellet whereas all the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ remained in the supernatant in the absence of microtubules . the microtubule pellet was resuspended to release _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and centrifuged . about half of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was released from microtubules in the presence of mm _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . about was released in the absence of nucleotide possibly because of the higher salt concentration in the buffer used for the release . however the amount of the released protein in the absence of nucleotide was certainly smaller than that in the presence of _PROTEIN_ suggesting the dependence of the release on _PROTEIN_ . these experiments indicate that the motor domain of binds to microtubules in an _PROTEIN_ dependent manner which is characteristic of krps . although we performed the microtubule gliding assay using the _PROTEIN_ protein to determine the motor activity of we could not observe the gliding of microtubules possibly because of the low yields of the protein . intracellular localization of and its determine the intracellular localization of antiserum was raised against a bacterially _PROTEIN_ fragment and preadsorbed with methanol fixed null cells to reduce the background reactivity . _METHOD_ microscopy using the anti antiserum in vegetative cells showed that was specifically enriched at actin rich cell surface protrusions such as pseudopodia and crowns and also weakly distributed throughout the cytoplasm . when starved dictyostelium cells undergo chemotactic migration toward _LOCATION_ chemoattractant camp becoming highly _PROTEIN_ and exhibiting actin assembly primarily in the pseudopods at their leading edges . in chemotaxing cells was specifically enriched at the actin rich leading edges and also weakly distributed throughout the cytoplasm . _METHOD_ was almost absent in a negative control null cells . to support the finding that associates with actin filaments in dictyostelium cells the cells were lysed with triton x in the absence or presence of and fractionated by centrifugation at low speed . in the absence of a kda protein with a predicted molecular _METHOD_ of was detected with the anti antiserum in both the tritoninsoluble cytoskeletal fraction and the triton soluble fraction . was not partitioned into the tritoninsoluble fraction in the presence of under these conditions actin filaments were severed by dependent actin severing proteins and almost absent in the low speed pellet fraction whereas microtubules were resistant to as previously described and still precipitated as the triton insoluble fraction . these results together with the colocalization of with actin indicate that associates with actin filaments and also resides as a cytoplasmic pool in cells . no associations of with microtubules in cells were observed in these studies . similarly conventional kinesin was localized to membranous structures but not to microtubules in _METHOD_ studies and the majority of the protein was recovered in the soluble fraction after cell lysis . then we _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ tagged and a series of truncated fragments in dictyostelium cells to identify the domain responsible for the association of with actin filaments . the proteins were _PROTEIN_ in the null background to rule out any heterodimer formation with endogenous . the full length tagged with _METHOD_ at the n terminus _METHOD_ showed a similar localization pattern to that of endogenous indicating that the _METHOD_ tag at the n terminus rarely affected the intracellular localization of . we found that truncation of the c terminal amino acid residues from _METHOD_ _METHOD_ resulted in a diffuse distribution throughout the cytoplasm suggesting that the c terminal tail domain is necessary for the association of with actin filaments . the c terminal tail domain tagged with _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was distributed throughout the cytoplasm and also specifically colocalized with actin indicating that only c terminal amino acid residues are sufficient for the association of with actin filaments . the tail fragment consisting of the n terminal _METHOD_ tag one of the putative coiled coil regions and the c terminal residues _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ often aggregated into compact clusters with actin . cells overexpressing _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ showed an increase in the proportion of multinucleate cells when they were grown in shaken suspension culture presumably because _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ accumulated with actin in the cleavage furrow to obstruct the furrow ingression during cytokinesis . characterization of the actin binding properties of the tail above results led us to conclude that the c terminal tail domain is necessary and sufficient for the association of with actin filaments in cells . given the existence of basic residues in the tail domain it is possible that the domain directly interacts with the negatively charged actin molecule . to investigate the direct interactions of the tail domain with actin filaments in vitro we _PROTEIN_ the tail domain tagged with glutathione s transferase _PROTEIN_ at the n terminus in e. coli _PROTEIN_ and purified it to homogeneity to perform cosedimentation assays . _PROTEIN_ alone showed no significant association with actin as previously described . about of _PROTEIN_ t was found in the precipitation with actin filaments in the presence of actin at a low salt concentration whereas all the _PROTEIN_ t remained in the supernatant in the absence of actin . using a constant final concentration of actin and varying concentrations of _PROTEIN_ t the fractional saturation was plotted against the concentration of free _PROTEIN_ t to determine the dissociation constant . the mean kd was measured to be under the low salt condition . in addition the binding of _PROTEIN_ t to actin filaments was sensitive to the concentration of salt . these experiments indicate that the tail domain of directly interacts with actin primarily by electrostatic interactions . many actin cross linking proteins direct cross linking or bundling of actin filaments by utilizing two discrete actin binding sites . the tail domain the actin binding site in is located adjacent to putative coiled coil regions and possibly becomes two discrete actin binding sites when the protein _METHOD_ a dimer . furthermore the tagged tail domain including putative coiled coil regions often aggregated into clusters with actin in dictyostelium cells as described above . these findings prompted us to investigate whether bundles or otherwise cross links actin filaments . we first _PROTEIN_ the tail domain including coiled coil regions as a six histidine tagged protein in e. coli _PROTEIN_ and purified it to homogeneity to perform cosedimentation assays at low speed . _PROTEIN_ was not used as a tag in these studies to exclude artificial dimer formation of the protein via _PROTEIN_ moiety . after incubation with actin filaments under a medium salt condition his _PROTEIN_ was subjected to low speed centrifugation to precipitate the cross linked filaments . most of his _PROTEIN_ and actin were found in the precipitation _PROTEIN_ implying that his _PROTEIN_ cross linked actin filaments . on the other hand actin or his _PROTEIN_ alone remained in the supernatant fraction in the absence of his _PROTEIN_ or actin respectively _PROTEIN_ . next we observed the cross linked actin filaments by electron microscopy . these filaments were found to associate into _PROTEIN_ tight bundles when mixed with his _PROTEIN_ whereas individual filaments were observed in the absence of his _PROTEIN_ . these results indicate that the tail domain including coiled coil regions can bundle actin filaments in vitro . disruption of the gene and overexpression of the examine the physiological functions of in dictyostelium cells the gene was disrupted using homologous recombination to generate the null strain . by pcr two independent clones were identified to have the homologous recombination event . they lost the _PROTEIN_ of as revealed by western blot analysis with the anti antiserum . the null cells showed normal morphology at the vegetative stage and grew normally in an axenic suspension culture . furthermore they showed normal pinocytosis phagocytosis exocytosis and contractile _LOCATION_ functions under hypo osmotic conditions and cell cell adhesions . in the course of development upon starvation these null cells streamed to aggregate normally and formed fruiting bodies comparable with those of wild type cells . these results suggest that the gene is not essential for the normal growth and development of dictyostelium cells under laboratory conditions . to further elucidate the cellular functions of n terminal epitope tagged _PROTEIN_ orits truncated mutant lacking the motor domain _PROTEIN_ were overexpressed in dictyostelium cells under control of the constitutively active actin promoter . in these studies the proteins were _PROTEIN_ in a null background to exclude any heterodimer formation with endogenous . transformed cells were cultured on a plastic surface at a low level of antibiotic _PROTEIN_ and used within weeks because these cells exhibited a reduced _PROTEIN_ of the proteins otherwise . cells overexpressing the mutant protein that lacks the motor domain often showed large lamellipodia and _LOCATION_ ruffles enriched with actin filaments whereas null cells showed a normal distribution of actin filaments with actin rich cell surface protrusions comparable with those of wild type cells . cells overexpressing full length were often larger than other types of cells . they showed not only large lamellipodia and _LOCATION_ ruffles observed in cells but also multiple crowns enriched with actin filaments along the periphery of cells . just like cells overexpressing _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and cells also showed defects in cytokinesis when grown in shaken suspension presumably because of the accumulation of actin in the cleavage furrow . some dictyostelium mutant cells such as myosin ii null show defects in cytokinesis in shaken suspension but not in contact with surfaces a milder condition for growth . it must be noted that even under this milder condition cells showed a slight impairment of cytokinesis whereas cells showed normal cytokinesis . these results suggest that overexpression of or its deletion mutant affects the organization of actin _LOCATION_ and cells overexpressing full length show severer defects than those overexpressing the mutant that lacks the motor domain .
