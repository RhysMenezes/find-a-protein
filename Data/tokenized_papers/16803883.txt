_PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is a high molecular weight _PROTEIN_ binding protein _PROTEIN_ involved in the control of cell proliferation and differentiation during plant development . mutations in the c terminal region of _PROTEIN_ result in severe developmental defects . we show here that the c terminal domain of _PROTEIN_ controls the subcellular distribution of this protein . we also demonstrated in vitro and in vivo by forster resonance energy transfer that this c terminal region is required for interaction with fan _PROTEIN_ a new member of the plant specific family of nac transcription _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ and fan are translocated into the _LOCATION_ upon auxin treatment in plant seedlings . the _LOCATION_ translocation of _PROTEIN_ is dependent on the presence of the c terminus of the protein . finally we showed that fan is involved in _PROTEIN_ regulated processes because fan overproduction partly complemented the _PROTEIN_ phenotype . we suggest that _PROTEIN_ regulates the function of this nac like transcription _PROTEIN_ by controlling its targeting to the _LOCATION_ upon plant cell division .
mutations in the c terminal domain of _PROTEIN_ lead to severe developmental _PROTEIN_ mutants were originally isolated on the basis of their early developmental phenotype . two alleles were analyzed in more detail as both the mutations concerned the c terminal domain of the protein . the _PROTEIN_ allele was obtained from the versailles t dna collection and resulted from an insertion in the exon of the gene . this insertion led to the deletion of amino acids corresponding to the last amino acids of the third tpr motif and the entire c terminal region . a second allele with a mutation in the c terminal part of _PROTEIN_ gene _PROTEIN_ was identified from a population subjected to ethyl methanesulfonate mutagenesis . the _PROTEIN_ mutation involves the replacement of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ by a at the intron donor splicing site . this mutation results in partial splicing of the exon generating a smaller transcript a translational frameshift and a premature stop codon . the predicted sequence of the _PROTEIN_ protein in the _PROTEIN_ mutant displayed a deletion of amino acids corresponding to the last amino acids of the third tpr motif and the entire c terminal domain . the two alleles had similar developmental phenotypes with a small _PROTEIN_ hypocotyl finger shaped cotyledons and small fused leaves . both mutants displayed ectopic cell proliferation in the presence of cytokinins . the identification of two mutations with similar phenotypes and modified _PROTEIN_ protein c termini suggests that this domain plays an essential role in plant development . the c terminal domain is required for _PROTEIN_ exclusion from the _LOCATION_ investigated the intracellular distribution of _PROTEIN_ using a _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein produced under control of the cauliflower mosaic virus promoter . the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion was functional and it complemented the _PROTEIN_ mutant . as the c terminal region of _PROTEIN_ was required for the function of the protein we investigated whether this region played an important role in controlling the subcellular distribution of the protein . a fusion protein consisting of the _PROTEIN_ protein deleted of the last c terminal amino acids fused to _METHOD_ was generated _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . this truncated fusion protein was produced under control of the promoter in arabidopsis . this protein was correctly produced _METHOD_ _METHOD_ but did not complement the _PROTEIN_ mutant demonstrating the functional importance of this c terminal domain . the subcellular distribution of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion proteins was analyzed in arabidopsis seedlings root cells . the location of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was _PROTEIN_ in the _LOCATION_ and excluded from the _LOCATION_ whereas _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was observed in both the compartments . the subcellular distribution of _PROTEIN_ was also confirmed in a different system the tobacco cells . the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein was also found in the _LOCATION_ of interphasic tobacco cells . however during the exponential growth phase during which cells were actively dividing _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was occasionally detected in the _LOCATION_ . unlike _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein was not excluded from the _LOCATION_ and was present in the _LOCATION_ as well as the _LOCATION_ of cells as in arabidopsis plants . the c terminus of _PROTEIN_ therefore _METHOD_ to be necessary for the _LOCATION_ exclusion of _PROTEIN_ . a member of the nac transcription _PROTEIN_ family interacts with the c terminal domain of _PROTEIN_ we used a yeast two hybrid approach to identify proteins interacting with _PROTEIN_ . we used the full length _PROTEIN_ protein as bait and screened million clones from two a. thaliana cdna libraries . we identified seven independent clones one of which had a sequence similar to those of the nac family of transcription _PROTEIN_ and was subsequently named fan _PROTEIN_ . we carried out in vitro pulldown assays to confirm the results obtained with the yeast two hybrid system . we first assessed the ability of an mbp fan affinity _PROTEIN_ to capture the streptavidin tagged _PROTEIN_ recombinant protein _PROTEIN_ . strep _PROTEIN_ was captured by mbp fan but not by the amylose beads alone . this interaction was further confirmed in a pulldown assay with an mbp fan column and crude protein extract from cells _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ construct . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ bound to the mbp fan column but not to the maltose _PROTEIN_ alone . yeast two hybrid assays showed that the c terminus of _PROTEIN_ interacted most strongly with the fan clone . we therefore used in vitro assays to assess the involvement of the c terminal domain of _PROTEIN_ in fan binding . strep _PROTEIN_ and strep _PROTEIN_ deleted of the c terminal domain _PROTEIN_ were produced in vitro and the proteins were bound to strep tactin beads . mbp fan was retained on the strep _PROTEIN_ column but was only weakly retained on strep _PROTEIN_ columns and strep tactin beads alone . these data suggest that the c terminus of _PROTEIN_ is required for interaction with fan . nac transcription _PROTEIN_ were named after the no apical meristem _PROTEIN_ protein of petunia and the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ and cup shape _PROTEIN_ genes . they have a characteristic conserved n terminal domain of about amino acids defined as the nac domain . the clone isolated by two hybrid screening corresponded to residues of the _GENE_ gene . the nac domain of the fan protein was and identical to the nac domains of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ respectively . computer analyses of the _PROTEIN_ profile of fan revealed that this gene was _PROTEIN_ at low but constant levels during most stages of plant development with the exception of the final stages of seed development where fan was highly _PROTEIN_ . interestingly _PROTEIN_ mutants display major defects in embryo development . we therefore hypothesized that the _PROTEIN_ and fan genes would be coexpressed in the developing embryo . in situ hybridization confirmed that both genes were indeed _PROTEIN_ in the same cells of mature embryos . in vivo interaction between _PROTEIN_ and fan requires the c terminal then investigated whether fan could interact with _PROTEIN_ in vivo . we first coexpressed constructs encoding _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and a dsred fan fusion protein transiently in n. benthamiana leaves . as shown in arabidopsis and cells _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was localized in the cytoplasm of n. benthamiana epidermal cells . dsred fan was also localized in the cytoplasm and colocalized with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . following the coexpression of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and dsred fan _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was found in both the cytoplasm and _LOCATION_ as expected and dsred fan was detected in the cytoplasm . in contrast to what was observed with the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and dsred fan were seldom if ever colocalized . we then used _METHOD_ resonance energy transfer technology to demonstrate the direct interaction between _PROTEIN_ and fan in vivo . the _METHOD_ dsred combination was shown previously to be a suitable donor acceptor pair for fret in living plant cells . we evaluated fret efficiency by a method based on an increase in donor _METHOD_ after photochemical destruction of the acceptor in n. benthamiana leaf cells coexpressing the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and dsred fan constructs . we determined the _METHOD_ intensity of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in a region in diameter localized in the cytoplasm . dsred fan was then photobleached to achieve at least acceptor bleaching which is sufficient for fret measurement and protection of the _METHOD_ signal against quenching . we then measured the _METHOD_ intensity of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ before and after photobleaching . in more than independent photobleaching experiments a significant increase in the _METHOD_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ represented by fret efficiency of up to was observed . this increase in _METHOD_ _METHOD_ after photobleaching was not seen in cells coexpressing the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and dsred fan constructs . mean fret efficiency for the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fan constructs was versus for the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and dsred fan constructs . colocalization and fret analysis demonstrated that _PROTEIN_ interacted in vivo with fan and that its c terminus was required for this interaction . in dividing cells _PROTEIN_ and fan are colocalized in the _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ in animals have been shown to shuttle between different subcellular compartments . the regulatory role of _PROTEIN_ may involve the _LOCATION_ targeting of transcription _PROTEIN_ such as fan . indeed the c terminal domain controls the subcellular distribution of _PROTEIN_ and is involved in its interaction with fan . fan like _PROTEIN_ is excluded from the _LOCATION_ in differentiated cells . finally mutations in the c terminal domain were associated with cell proliferation and cell de differentiation during early plant development . it therefore appears likely that the subcellular distributions of fan and _PROTEIN_ are modified following specific physiological changes such as cell de differentiation and division . stable arabidopsis transgenic lines _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein encoding constructs were produced to allow the colocalization of _PROTEIN_ or fan with the dna vital green stain . analysis of transgenic arabidopsis plants _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ or _METHOD_ fan constructs showed that these two fusion proteins did not seem to colocalize with _LOCATION_ dna with a distribution very similar to that observed for _METHOD_ fusion proteins . the subcellular distribution of the fusion proteins was further analyzed by quantifying _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ across the cell . although in n. benthamiana epidermal cells both proteins seemed to be excluded from the _LOCATION_ in transgenic arabidopsis root cells some _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ for _METHOD_ fan could still be detected in the _LOCATION_ . we then applied exogenous auxin to the seedlings to promote cell de differentiation and division . the treatment of arabidopsis seedlings with naphthaleneacetic acid for h led to auxin accumulation in the root tip and to ectopic cell division along the root axis . auxin treatment led to an increase in _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ fan accumulation in the _LOCATION_ as illustrated by the colocalization of the _METHOD_ signal with the dna vital dye . the accumulation of _METHOD_ in the _LOCATION_ was confirmed by quantification of _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ across the cell . the _LOCATION_ accumulation of these two fusion proteins was observed in cells located above the primary root tip . thus _PROTEIN_ and fan are able to accumulate into the _LOCATION_ in physiological conditions associated with cell division and cell de differentiation . fan overproduction partially complements the _PROTEIN_ major defects in embryonic and vegetative development caused by deletion of the c terminus of _PROTEIN_ may result from defective interaction between _PROTEIN_ and fan . we investigated whether fan _PROTEIN_ was functionally related to _PROTEIN_ phenotype by overexpressing fan in the wild type and _PROTEIN_ genetic backgrounds . wild type transformants showed no obvious developmental phenotype . kanamycin resistant mutants were selected from families of heterozygous _PROTEIN_ mutants transformed with the fan construct . among the independent transgenic lines lines segregating _PROTEIN_ mutations were analyzed further . first fan mrna levels was quantified in the transgenic _PROTEIN_ mutants by quantitative rt pcr . fan _PROTEIN_ was increased and fold compared with _PROTEIN_ mutant in the lines and . transgenics mutants from and lines developed almost normal leaves very different from those of the untransformed _PROTEIN_ seedlings . conversely the mutants from line did not show clear overexpression of fan and as expected showed a much weaker restoration of leaf development . although leaf development of _PROTEIN_ mutants _METHOD_ to be correlated with the _PROTEIN_ level of fan _PROTEIN_ root development absent in _PROTEIN_ mutants was not restored by fan overexpression . the partial compensation of the _PROTEIN_ post embryonic phenotype resulting from fan overexpression suggests that fan is probably involved in some _PROTEIN_ regulated processes .

behind the promoter into the vector from tsuyoshi nakagawa . fan cdna was also cloned into pgdr to produce the fusion protein fan . a dsred based vector was required for the acceptor bleaching fret
