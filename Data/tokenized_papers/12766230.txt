the development of chloroplasts and the integration of their function within a plant cell rely on the presence of a complex biochemical machinery located within their limiting envelope _LOCATION_ . to provide the most exhaustive view of the protein repertoire of chloroplast envelope _LOCATION_ we analyzed this _LOCATION_ system using proteomics . to this purpose we first developed a procedure to prepare highly purified envelope _LOCATION_ from arabidopsis chloroplasts . we then extracted envelope proteins using different methods i.e . chloroform/methanol extraction and alkaline or saline treatments in order to retrieve as many proteins as possible from the most to least hydrophobic ones . liquid chromatography tandem _METHOD_ _METHOD_ analyses were then performed on each envelope _LOCATION_ subfraction leading to the identification of more than proteins . about of the identified proteins are known to be or are very likely located in the chloroplast envelope . the validation of localization in the envelope of two phosphate transporters exemplifies the need for a combination of strategies to perform the most exhaustive identification of genuine chloroplast envelope proteins . interestingly some of the identified proteins are found to be acetylated which indicates the accurate location of the n terminus of the corresponding mature protein . with _PROTEIN_ to function more than of the identified proteins have functions known or very likely to be associated with the chloroplast envelope . these proteins are a involved in ion and metabolite transport b components of the protein import machinery and c involved in chloroplast lipid metabolism . some soluble proteins like proteases proteins involved in _PROTEIN_ metabolism or proteins involved in responses to oxidative stress were associated with envelope _LOCATION_ . almost one third of the proteins we identified have no known function . the present work helps understanding chloroplast envelope metabolism at the molecular level and provides a new overview of the biochemical machinery of the chloroplast envelope _LOCATION_ .
chloroplasts from a. thaliana were purified according to kunst with some modifications of the previously described protocol in order to optimize yield and purity . using this protocol an average of mg chloroplast proteins was purified from g of wk old arabidopsis leaves . excellent purity of these percoll purified arabidopsis chloroplasts was confirmed through proteomic analysis . only of the identified arabidopsis proteins may correspond to nonplastid proteins . among them one protein appeared to correspond to a previously characterized major _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ component four proteins may indicate contamination by major tonoplast proteins and one from a glyoxysome _LOCATION_ compartment . considering the high sensitivity of present _METHOD_ spectrometers it was not surprising to detect minute amounts of these few extra _LOCATION_ contaminants which are major proteins in their respective subcellular compartment . however because the subcellular localization of some of these proteins remains to be unambiguously determined the contamination of the percoll purified arabidopsis chloroplasts may be overestimated . indeed we were recently able to demonstrate the unique _LOCATION_ localization of a phosphate transporter that was previously suspected to be associated to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . it is also important to notice that none of the identified proteins appears to derive from mitochondria an organelle known to represent a classical contaminant of purified _LOCATION_ . in order to purify _LOCATION_ subfractions _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ percoll purified intact chloroplasts were lyzed in hypotonic medium and the three fractions were separated on sucrose gradients . from these _LOCATION_ preparations an average of mg proteins from the stroma mg _LOCATION_ proteins and envelope proteins could be purified . purified envelope stroma and _LOCATION_ proteins were further analyzed by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and these three fractions were shown to be poorly cross contaminated . indeed fig . shows that the rubisco the major stroma protein was hardly detected in other subplastidial fractions . it is also noticeable that the lhcps which are major _LOCATION_ proteins were highly enriched in the _LOCATION_ fraction and hardly visible in other subplastidial fractions . finally the phosphate/triose phosphate translocator known as the major envelope component was exclusively detected in the envelope fraction . this enrichment of envelope proteins in the purified fraction was further confirmed using western blot experiments demonstrating enrichment of ceqorh which is exclusively located in the _LOCATION_ envelope . being the most likely source of _LOCATION_ contamination of the purified envelope fraction _LOCATION_ cross contamination was precisely assessed . chlorophyll being the most conspicuous _LOCATION_ component we first analyzed the presence of this pigment in envelope _LOCATION_ preparations . indeed the yellow color of the purified envelope fractions first indicates that purified envelope vesicles contain very few _LOCATION_ . on a protein basis the ratio of chlorophyll content detected in the purified envelope and _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ respectively was . western blot analyses were further performed with lhcp polyclonal antibodies as markers of _LOCATION_ contamination . as presented in fig . the proteins present in several independent envelope preparations appeared to contain between and _LOCATION_ protein . we recently demonstrated that proteins extracted by chloroform/methanol mixtures are the most hydrophobic proteins of a _LOCATION_ system . thus the hydrophobic core of the spinach chloroplast envelope was analyzed and new envelope transporters were identified . the present study shows the importance of using complementary methods aiming at the most exhaustive identification of envelope proteins . using three different extraction procedures i.e . chloroform/methanol extraction alkaline treatment and saline treatment more than proteins could be identified from highly purified fractions of the a. thaliana chloroplast envelope . these three complementary methods were used in order to retrieve and identify as many envelope proteins as possible from the most to the least hydrophobic ones . indeed about two third of identified proteins were found from only one extraction method and not from any of the two other ones . this provides additional evidence to demonstrate the interest in using a wide set of methods to get the most exhaustive repertoire of a complex protein mixture . in the present study the difference in protein dynamic range and in stringency with respect to protein hydrophobicity might explain the complementarities of the methods . organic solvent extraction allowed the highest percentage of highly hydrophobic proteins to be retrieved as already shown in previous works . this extraction method allowed the identification of putative transporters _PROTEIN_ which were not detected using either alkaline or saline treatment and which are likely to be low abundant transporters . indeed transporters are often minor components of a _LOCATION_ system and most of them are highly hydrophobic . by concentrating highly hydrophobic proteins chloroform/methanol extraction makes some minor transporters amenable to _METHOD_ spectrometric analysis and further identification . however such an extraction procedure requires enough material as the yield of protein recovery in this fraction is about of the total amount of proteins present in the native _LOCATION_ . although being less stringent with respect to the hydrophobicity and providing the use of highly purified fractions alkaline and saline treatments allowed the identification of some highly hydrophobic proteins altogether with more hydrophilic ones . as expected the more stringent the extraction method the less the number of proteins identified . chloroform/methanol is the most stringent method and alkaline treatment is more stringent than saline treatment with _PROTEIN_ to the recovery of hydrophobic proteins . indeed chloroform/methanol extraction alkaline and saline treatments allowed the identification of and proteins respectively . the specificity toward hydrophobicity of each extraction method was exemplified by the identification of hydrophobic contaminants . the identification of only _LOCATION_ proteins in the overall analyses of the chloroplast envelope _METHOD_ the low _LOCATION_ contamination level considering that in chloroplasts the overall _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ protein is about times more abundant than envelope proteins . the percentage of _LOCATION_ contaminants was found different according to the extraction method used . indeed the alkaline or saline treatments which do not solubilize integral _LOCATION_ proteins provided a fair evaluation of the percentage of _LOCATION_ contamination _LOCATION_ . in contrast traces of some of the major _LOCATION_ proteins in envelope subfractions appear to be concentrated during the extraction of hydrophobic proteins using chloroform/methanol . indeed extraction in organic solvent allows the recovery of more than of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ proteins but only of the envelope proteins _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . consequently extractions of envelope fractions using organic solvents resulted in the enrichment of major _LOCATION_ integral _LOCATION_ proteins _LOCATION_ even if original _LOCATION_ contamination was shown to be very low . the aim of a targeted proteomic study such as the present one is to provide relevant identifications for subsequent functional study . our aim being the identification of envelope proteins the identified proteins were classified according to their known _PROTEIN_ or putative _PROTEIN_ localization . known localizations were essentially retrieved from previous studies . although being arbitrary putative localizations were assessed using rigorous criteria . putative localization in the inner _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ was suggested with respect to the strong hydrophobicity and the presence of a predicted chloroplastic transit peptide . moreover as discussed further some of these proteins have putative functions that are compatible with their localization in the chloroplast inner envelope _LOCATION_ . putative localization in the outer _LOCATION_ refers to high homology with previously characterized outer envelope proteins from other plant species . putative localization in the envelope was suggested because of the very low contamination level keeping in _PROTEIN_ that all identified contaminants are major and characterized proteins in their respective subcellular compartments . some of these proteins likely to be located in the envelope show different levels of homology with proteins previously classified as members of mitochondrial transporter families . as no known protein from mitochondria was detected in the present proteomic approach these putative transporters are rather unlikely to be actually located in mitochondria . other putative locations were deduced from the strong homology with proteins of known location . according to the classification described above about of the identified proteins can be considered as genuine envelope proteins only being peripheral envelope proteins and the remaining ones being either genuine outer or inner envelope _LOCATION_ proteins . however one can not exclude that some of the stromal proteins could actually be bound to the envelope as suggested for example for the multienzyme complexes with benson calvin cycle activities or for the acetyl coa _PROTEIN_ . finally are proteins from other chloroplast subcompartments _LOCATION_ and only of the identified proteins are not chloroplastic proteins . the possible function of the identified proteins was also assessed using bioinformatic tools such as blast or interproscan . many of the identified chloroplast envelope proteins are proteins involved in actual or putative transport functions . another of these chloroplast proteins have unknown function and none of the bioinformatic tools we used were able to suggest any function . this opens up real new and _PROTEIN_ investigation areas to find new and unsuspected functions for these new chloroplast envelope proteins . moreover some of them being highly hydrophobic new families of transport _METHOD_ might have been pointed out . indeed it is suspected that plant cells might have evolved unique transport properties that have no homolog in prokaryotic or other eukaryotic cells . the implication of identified proteins with characterized or putative function for the chloroplast metabolism is discussed further . the present study gave clues for the accurate location of the n terminus of some proteins . except for most proteins from the outer envelope _LOCATION_ and for the recently described ceqorh all chloroplastic proteins bear a cleavable n terminal transit peptide . although efficient bioinformatic tools like targetp or chlorop are able to predict such transit peptides these tools are not reliable . fig . shows the analyzed peptides that are very likely to correspond to the n terminus of some identified mature proteins . this assumption was based i on the location of these peptides at the very n terminus end of the predicted protein sequence and/or ii on their location near a predicted chloroplastic transit peptide maturation site and/or iii on the n acetylation of their n terminus . was found to be a putative _LOCATION_ channel protein very likely to be located in the outer _LOCATION_ . in agreement with this location no transit peptide signal was predicted for this protein . the present proteomic approach confirmed this prediction as the n terminus of this protein could be analyzed by _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . like for many proteins the methionine at the n terminus was removed . in the case of and proteins the n terminal peptides were found downstream of the predicted transit peptide but very close to the predicted maturation site . interestingly in the case of a _METHOD_ analyzed peptide was found upstream of the predicted transit peptide indicating that the putative location of the maturation site is not accurate . the n terminal peptides analyzed for and did not result from a specific trypsin cleavage . although unspecific enzymatic cleavages are known to occur the location of these nontryptic peptides very close to the predicted transit peptide signal strongly suggests that these peptides represent the n terminus of the processed proteins . other peptides located at the n terminus of some arabidopsis proteins were found n acetylated . with respect to this observation previously identified spinach envelope protein derived tryptic peptides were checked for the presence of such posttranslational modifications . acetylation is acknowledged to be a common post translational modification of eukaryotic protein n termini . indeed it was estimated that of eukaryotic soluble proteins were n acetylated . some proteins and _PROTEIN_ were not predicted for having a chloroplastic transit peptide . moreover two of them and _PROTEIN_ are known to be located in the outer envelope _LOCATION_ which excludes the requirement for a transit chloroplastic peptide . in agreement with these predictions acetylation occurred at the very n terminal end of the protein and concerned the n terminal methionine _PROTEIN_ or the second amino acid residue . other proteins were predicted for having a chloroplastic transit peptide . for proteins _PROTEIN_ and n acetylated peptides were found very close to the predicted maturation site . for proteins and n acetylated peptides were found about amino acids downstream of the predicted maturation site thus suggesting that the prediction is not correct for these two proteins . two other cases were not in agreement with chlorop predictions and _PROTEIN_ . indeed no maturation site was predicted for these proteins while an n acetylated peptide was found close to the n terminus of these proteins . nevertheless the relative connection between predictions and proteomic results shows that the maturation site prediction of _LOCATION_ envelope proteins using the chlorop program is rather accurate . many post translational modifications have been described for plant and more precisely for chloroplast proteins . indeed methylation and _PROTEIN_ of proteins of the rubisco complex glycosylation of a chloroplastic coupling _PROTEIN_ palmitoylation of chloroplastic herbicide binding protein and phosphorylation of a _LOCATION_ protein have been described . n acetylation of _LOCATION_ proteins has emerged as an intriguing feature of the photosystem ii . in addition to being found in four lhc ii molecules it is also found in three out of four phosphoproteins of the photosystem ii core . the three identified n acetylated peptides correspond to the n termini of dl and cpa _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ proteins and each begins with n acetyl phosphothreonine . in a paper dealing with _LOCATION_ proteins peltier et al . quoted that among proteins analyzed by edman degradation none were likely to be blocked at the n terminus . the authors concluded that the n termini of most mature chloroplastic proteins are unlikely to be further modified . indeed all _LOCATION_ encoded chloroplastic proteins which bear a transit peptide are processed at the n terminus after import to remove this peptide . thus possible terminal modifications of the protein precursors that occurred in the _LOCATION_ are likely to be removed for proteins targeted to the chloroplast via a cleavable transit peptide . conversely acetylation of processed proteins that are known to be targeted to the inner envelope _LOCATION_ e.g . and and _PROTEIN_ would imply an acetylation process in the course or after transit peptide cleavage . the question arising from these n acetylations is the following do they result from an in vivo process or are they an experimental artifact ? for instance it is acknowledged that _PROTEIN_ can occur in the presence of urea and thus can be artifact . in the present study n acetylation was only observed for peptides likely to correspond to the n terminus of the chloroplast envelope proteins . therefore if chemical acetylation occurred it would have been before tryptic cleavage . the procedure used from chloroplast fractionation to _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ analysis and before trypsin digestion is not in favor of a chemical acetylation . consequently in vivo acetylation of chloroplast envelope proteins is very likely to occur in the course or after transit peptide cleavage . as described in the literature acetyltransferases have specific substrates either glycine alanine serine or threonine residues or methionine residue . in good agreement among the acetylations described in fig . correspond to gast substrates and to an m substrate . furthermore in the case of the m substrate acetylation occurred because the adjacent amino acid residue is a glutamic acid in agreement with the literature . therefore and as previously observed for _LOCATION_ proteins we can conclude that acetylation actually occurs for chloroplast envelope proteins . consequently when such acetylated tryptic peptides are identified this suggests that these peptides might be the potential n termini of the corresponding mature proteins . the question of the exact location of the n terminus of these chloroplast envelope proteins could be addressed by intact protein _METHOD_ measurements . this strategy has been advocated for chloroplast _LOCATION_ proteomics and developed into a viable proteomics strategy with lc _METHOD_ analyses . the technology to perform intact protein _METHOD_ measurements on integral _LOCATION_ proteins including transporters with up to transmembrane helices using electrospray ionization has been developed and would be of great help to answer this question . the present proteomic study performed on subfractions deriving from arabidopsis chloroplast envelope _LOCATION_ allowed identifying more than _LOCATION_ proteins most of them being genuine envelope components . because the arabidopsis genome has been fully sequenced this plant is the model of choice for proteomic analyses as far as protein identification is concerned . it appears however that a combination of strategies and plant models is required to perform the exhaustive identification of the chloroplast envelope proteins . when focusing on the same chloroform/methanol extraction of envelope purified from both arabidopsis and spinach chloroplasts it appears that proteins were exclusively found in arabidopsis while more than were exclusively found in the spinach samples . this suggests that several plant models may be required to identify chloroplast envelope proteins . all known inner envelope proteins contain a classical n terminal _LOCATION_ transit peptide and thus should be predicted as localized in _LOCATION_ using in silico approaches . however while localized in the inner _LOCATION_ of the chloroplast envelope the ceqorh identified in the _LOCATION_ envelope could not be predicted to be localized in _LOCATION_ because it lacks a classical n terminal and cleavable _LOCATION_ transit peptide . likewise the protein could not be predicted to be _LOCATION_ localized because of an _LOCATION_ in the prediction of the region in the arabidopsis open reading frame during the arabidopsis genome annotation . _PROTEIN_ or some major outer envelope proteins could not be predicted to be localized in _LOCATION_ because they lack a classical n terminal chloroplast transit peptide like most outer envelope _LOCATION_ proteins . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were initially identified in pea chloroplast envelope _LOCATION_ as components of the chloroplast protein import machinery . these two proteins were identified in arabidopsis but not detected in spinach . the case of phosphate transporters further highlights the requirement for using different biological models and strategies . as presented in table ii the _PROTEIN_ phosphate transporter that was localized in the spinach chloroplast envelope was not identified during the study performed on arabidopsis . with an in silico analysis using chlorop a correct _LOCATION_ localization was predicted for the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ but not for the spinach protein . conversely the same prediction tool predicts the _LOCATION_ localization of the spinach triose phosphate/phosphate translocator but does not predict that of the arabidopsis protein . using recent information deriving from full length sequencing of arabidopsis cdnas we could identify some proteins corresponding to previously unassigned spinach peptides . among these proteins is the protein a putative phosphate transporter . a close homologue of this protein was also identified in arabidopsis genome initiative predictions using a blast based method . only arabidopsis protein is predicted to be localized in _LOCATION_ . however and in contrast with the homologue we have not detected the protein by proteomics . using transient _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ fusions in arabidopsis cells we demonstrated that both and proteins were targeted to _LOCATION_ thus strengthening the envelope localization and supporting the hypothesis that is indeed a _LOCATION_ protein . this latter protein may be i too poorly represented in chloroplasts purified from arabidopsis or spinach leaves ii only _PROTEIN_ in nongreen tissues of the plant or iii only _PROTEIN_ at a given time of plant development thus strengthening the interest of an in silico approach based on the prediction of protein structure and subcellular localization . databases like _PROTEIN_ that use a set of different prediction _METHOD_ to provide a statistical view of the possible subcellular localization are therefore very interesting . alternatively subcellular specific proteomic approaches have to be performed on other plant tissues that are compatible with the preparation of highly purified _LOCATION_ . several proteins were identified that correspond to validated or putative ion and metabolite transporters . they represented a high proportion of the proteins present in the chloroform/methanol extract . nine proteins correspond to previously identified chloroplast envelope components and eight are previously unidentified envelope components that may catalyze transport activities across the chloroplast envelope . and hpsot are identified members of the oxoglutarate/malate translocator family and and are known members of the phosphate translocator family . and are two putative sugar transporters is a putative mitochondrial carrier like protein and is the previously identified member of the na /taurocholate transporter family . the implication of the association of these proteins in the envelope was previously discussed . is the arabidopsis homologue of the previously identified _PROTEIN_ pea protein _LOCATION_ . the previously identified and the new protein are two members of the _PROTEIN_ like family that share homology with major integral peroxisomal _LOCATION_ proteins suspected to act as solute transporters . is a new member of the putative peroxisomal calcium dependent solute carrier family but is distinct from the member previously identified in spinach . is a new member of the calcium dependent mitochondrial solute carrier family distinct from the member previously identified in spinach . members of this last family transport oxodicarboxylates across the inner _LOCATION_ of mitochondria . they can transport oxoadipate oxoglutarate adipate glutarate and to a lesser extent pimelate oxopimelate aminoadipate oxaloacetate and citrate . is a member of the nonintrinsic abc transporter family _PROTEIN_ and could be a subunit of multimeric quarter molecule abc transporters that when subjected to phylogenetic analyses group with the mdr/tap/atm family . _PROTEIN_ is referred to as the putative k efflux antiporter _PROTEIN_ and shares more than identity with the kefc homologue from escherichia coli a transport system that facilitates potassium efflux possibly by proton antiport . this _PROTEIN_ protein may thus participate in the modulation of k /h counterfluxes across the envelope . is referred as a potential cadmium/zinc transporting _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and belongs to the cation transport _PROTEIN_ family _PROTEIN_ . its sequence is distinct from that of the previously described chloroplast envelope _PROTEIN_ like protein . finally is a protein containing potential transmembrane helices sharing low homology with _PROTEIN_ transporters . other identified proteins of unknown function but containing several potential transmembrane helices may correspond to new chloroplast envelope transporters . indeed proteins among the unknown proteins found in arabidopsis envelope _LOCATION_ combine all the characteristics for putative chloroplast envelope transporters i.e . i a chloroplast transit peptide ii a ratio of number of amino acid residues to putative transmembrane domains below iii at least four transmembrane domains and iv a pi value above . import of _LOCATION_ encoded precursor proteins into the chloroplast occurs through translocon complexes at the outer and inner envelope _LOCATION_ . numerous biochemical studies resulted in the characterization of components of the chloroplast import machinery . we identified a series of proteins previously known to be part of the toc or the tic complexes . some of them have a high homology with pea proteins . table i demonstrates the identification of the three _PROTEIN_ components of the toc complex _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . we also identified _PROTEIN_ a protein similar to _PROTEIN_ and a like _PROTEIN_ protein . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are _PROTEIN_ binding proteins involved in precursor recognition and is forming an aqueous protein conducting channel . is expected to function as a docking protein for _LOCATION_ cofactors of the protein import into chloroplasts . concerning components of the tic complex we identified a series of proteins such as _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ a _PROTEIN_ like _PROTEIN_ protein and proteins with homology with _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . was the only lacking component of the previously identified members of the tic complex . this is not surprising because is highly hydrophilic contains no apparent _LOCATION_ spanning domains and is localized in the intermembrane space of the envelope . therefore is likely to be excluded from the samples we analyzed because it was extracted from the envelope by all the different treatments performed in this study . in contrast _PROTEIN_ is a hydrophobic integral _LOCATION_ protein playing a role in preprotein conductance at the inner envelope _LOCATION_ . _PROTEIN_ was proposed to have a putative _PROTEIN_ chaperone interacting function . _PROTEIN_ contains a predicted rieske type iron sulfur cluster and was shown to be part of the core of the tic complex . the n terminus of _PROTEIN_ shows strong homologies to nad dehydrogenases in eukaryotes and to _PROTEIN_ like proteins present in cyanobacteria and nongreen algae . we also identified several chaperones involved in protein import and _PROTEIN_ . was proposed to serve in recruiting chaperonin for folding of newly imported proteins . _PROTEIN_ a soluble _PROTEIN_ chaperone that appears to interact directly with _PROTEIN_ is thought to provide the driving force for chloroplast protein import . although identified as a stroma protein _PROTEIN_ is clearly functionally associated with the envelope _LOCATION_ . in addition we found three proteins with some homology to components of the mitochondrial import machinery _PROTEIN_ . this _METHOD_ our previous findings on spinach where we identified another homolog of the tim complex namely . because we can rule out a specific contamination of chloroplast envelope _LOCATION_ by tim components our analyses demonstrate the unexpected presence in chloroplast envelope _LOCATION_ of a series of proteins having homologies with components of the mitochondrial protein import machinery . in mitochondria _PROTEIN_ constitute the import channel for preproteins containing amino terminal hydrophilic presequences . the _PROTEIN_ and proteins have in common a similar topology in the _LOCATION_ and a homologous amino acid sequence . interestingly they show a sequence similarity to _PROTEIN_ a channel forming amino acid transporter in the outer envelope of chloroplasts and to livh a component of a prokaryotic amino acid permease . one can question whether these proteins are true components of the tic/toc complexes or whether another import system is present in chloroplast envelope _LOCATION_ . a similar question raised by the identification of an inner envelope protein containing internal targeting information is whether it is imported by distinct import mechanism like in mitochondria or by the normal tic/toc complexes used by precursor proteins containing cleavable n terminal transit sequences . finally our results provide further evidence for the use of cyanobacterial ancestor genes to build up the chloroplast envelope import machinery . several examples have been already described . for instance is rather close in sequence as well as in topography to a cyanobacterial channel forming protein . we identified _PROTEIN_ a protein having homology with the synechocystis protein . this cyanobacterial protein is likely to be involved in protein export and could act as a chaperonin by _PROTEIN_ the newly synthesized protein in an open conformation . a similar function of the related chloroplast protein is therefore rather possible . through our proteomics studies on spinach and arabidopsis chloroplast envelope _LOCATION_ we have identified several proteins involved in lipid metabolism . the first step of chloroplast _LOCATION_ lipid biosynthesis is the acylation of glycerol phosphate to form phosphatidic acid . this is catalyzed by two acyltransferases the first one responsible for lysophosphatidic acid biosynthesis is a stromal enzyme active in the vicinity of the inner envelope _LOCATION_ whereas the second one responsible for phosphatidic acid biosynthesis resides to the inner _LOCATION_ . indeed we identified lysophosphatidate acyltransferase an enzyme catalyzing the transfer of _PROTEIN_ to the sn position of lysophosphatidic acid leading to the synthesis of phosphatidic acid the precursor for chloroplast glycerolipids . _PROTEIN_ one of the three arabidopsis monogalactosyldiacylglycerol synthases the last committed step in mgdg biosynthesis was identified in our previous study on spinach . this protein is a very minor envelope protein thus providing some reason for its absence in the list of arabidopsis proteins . concerning the formation of other chloroplast specific glycerolipids we identified proteins that could participate to phosphatidylglycerol synthesis . the protein is a phosphatidylglycerophosphate synthase an arabidopsis mutant impaired in the corresponding gene _PROTEIN_ has an overall pg content reduced by and shows an reduction in _LOCATION_ enzyme activity . envelope _LOCATION_ also contain a protein that is a phosphatidylglycerophosphate synthase like protein . interestingly in silico analyses suggested that a putative cdp diacylglycerol synthetase could be present in envelope _LOCATION_ . this enzyme could be the first step committed to chloroplast pg synthesis . chloroplast glycerolipids synthesized through the envelope _LOCATION_ contain saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids and are therefore substrates for fatty acid desaturases that catalyze the formation of the polyunsaturated molecular species characteristic of _LOCATION_ glycerolipids . although genetic approaches shed new light on chloroplast _LOCATION_ desaturases with the characterization of arabidopsis mutants there was only little evidence for such enzymes to be present in chloroplast envelopes . indeed we identified in envelope _LOCATION_ two desaturases namely _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ corresponding respectively to omega and omega fatty acid desaturases . genetic analyses on _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutants demonstrated that they are both chloroplast enzymes active on glycerolipids and especially on galactolipids . _PROTEIN_ catalyzes the formation of from monounsaturated fatty acids whereas _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ introduces the third double bond leading to the formation of linolenate . fatty acid desaturation is a complex process that requires an electron transfer chain . using electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy vottero et al . characterized in the spinach chloroplast envelope electron paramagnetic resonance signals corresponding to putative components of an electron transfer chain . none of the envelope components responsible for such signal have been identified to date but the identification of a putative quinone oxidoreductase in our spinach preparation may provide a first clue toward characterization of members of an envelope electron transfer chain . interestingly we also identified a putative flavin containing oxidoreductase . in plant cells most saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids are synthesized within the _LOCATION_ stroma but they are also used in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ for the biosynthesis of phospholipid and therefore have to be exported to the _LOCATION_ . an hypothesis is that the acyl coa synthetase _LOCATION_ could be involved in fatty acids export from chloroplasts . we identified in arabidopsis envelope _LOCATION_ two proteins that could correspond to acyl coa synthetases . they were both among the putative acyl coa synthetases identified by shokey et al . in their survey of the arabidopsis genome . these authors demonstrated that only nine of these genes actually encoded long chain acyl coa synthetases . although containing a putative amp binding site is actually not a lacs because i it was unable to complement yeast mutants and ii the overexpressed protein was unable to synthesize acyl coas . the exact function of this envelope protein therefore remains to be identified . in contrast corresponds to one of the lacs proteins namely _PROTEIN_ . this protein was demonstrated by schnurr et al . to complement yeast mutants and to catalyze the synthesis of acyl coas . most interestingly they found that this protein is the major _LOCATION_ acyl coa synthetase and by in vitro protein import and _METHOD_ fusion experiments they demonstrated that it was targeted to the chloroplast envelope . interestingly _PROTEIN_ could not be extracted by a naoh washing of chloroplast envelope _LOCATION_ in good agreement with our findings . this protein does not have any transit peptide and resides at the outer envelope _LOCATION_ as shown by previous biochemical studies . oxylipins are metabolites produced by the oxidative transformation of unsaturated fatty acids via a series of diverging metabolic pathways . and joyard demonstrated that chloroplast envelope _LOCATION_ can synthesize oxylipins owing to enzymes like allene oxide synthase and hydroperoxyde lyase . indeed froehlich et al . demonstrated that these two proteins are respectively targeted to the inner and outer envelope _LOCATION_ . we identified one of these two proteins in arabidopsis envelope _LOCATION_ namely the allene oxide synthase . we also identified a phospholipid hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidase . this enzyme which converts fatty acid hydroperoxides into alcohols can be part of an ascorbate glutathione cycle . altogether these data suggest a role for envelope _LOCATION_ in plant defense signaling pathways because such processes involve oxylipins . among the proteins involved in fatty acid metabolism we identified two proteins and _PROTEIN_ corresponding to two subunits of the acetyl coa _PROTEIN_ complex respectively the and subunits . in general the accase complex is considered as soluble and is indeed easily extracted from the chloroplast stroma . however our results strongly support a series of observations suggesting that could be the subunit of the accase . more recently thelen and ohlrogge demonstrated the presence of and subunits of accase in envelope preparations by western blot experiments . they proposed that the binding of accase to the chloroplast envelope could occur through nonionic interactions to the _PROTEIN_ subunits . our results provide further support to such observations these proteins should be present at the stroma side of the inner envelope _LOCATION_ anchoring the accase complex to the _LOCATION_ . interestingly the subunit of accase is chloroplast encoded . we also identified _PROTEIN_ a protein that could be involved in lipid transfer between the inner envelope _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ . this function was postulated because of its dual localization immunocytochemical localization of this protein revealed that the protein occurred in clusters in the vicinity of both the envelope and the _LOCATION_ . another protein namely was shown to contain domains homologous to domains present in lipid transfer proteins . such proteins are essential in chloroplasts because the envelope is the site of _LOCATION_ lipid biosynthesis whereas _LOCATION_ are the site for their accumulation . chloroplast _LOCATION_ contain a series of compounds deriving from isopentenyl pyrophosphate carotenoids prenylquinones and chlorophyll precursors . these compounds are synthesized in envelope _LOCATION_ but some controversy still remains . concerning the biosynthesis of chlorophyll precursors protochlorophyllide oxidoreductase was characterized in spinach as well as in arabidopsis . the presence of this protein in envelope _LOCATION_ was first demonstrated functionally then with antibodies thus suggesting that envelope _LOCATION_ could play a role in the biosynthesis of chlorophyll precursors . indeed several other enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of protochlorophyllide were demonstrated to be present in purified envelope _LOCATION_ . to date none of these enzymes could be detected by proteomics . in chloroplasts the inner envelope _LOCATION_ was shown to be the site of tocopherol and plastoquinone synthesis . in contrast swiezewska et al . proposed that plastoquinone and ubiquinone biosynthesis was in _PROTEIN_ localized in _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and that a specific transport system was required for plastoquinone and ubiquinone transfer respectively to chloroplasts and mitochondria . due to the difficulty in handling such _LOCATION_ associated enzymes using classical biochemical approaches alternative approaches to clone the corresponding genes were developed . to date only a _LOCATION_ encoded methyltransferase _PROTEIN_ catalyzing the last step in ubiquinone biosynthesis and localized in the inner _LOCATION_ from plant mitochondria was characterized . we identified in envelope _LOCATION_ two proteins that are candidates for a role in chloroplast prenylquinone biosynthesis . _PROTEIN_ one of the major inner envelope _LOCATION_ protein is a s adenosyl l methionine dependent methyltransferase having homology with methyltransferase whereas presents a low homology with ubia prenyltransferase . interestingly a mutant containing a transposon within the gene encoding _PROTEIN_ was shown to have a much lower content of chloroplast prenylquinones thus suggesting that _PROTEIN_ is a methyltransferase committed to the biosynthesis of _LOCATION_ one intriguing question is why this protein is present in such large amounts in the inner envelope _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ . altogether these observations are strong arguments in favor of a major role of envelope _LOCATION_ in the biosynthesis of _LOCATION_ prenylquinones . finally major terpenoid compounds in envelope _LOCATION_ are carotenoids . although enzymes involved in carotenoid biosynthesis and metabolism have not been yet detected by proteomics in spinach or arabidopsis chloroplast envelope _LOCATION_ in silico analyses demonstrated that carotene hydroxylase an enzyme of the zeaxanthin pathway could be localized in envelope _LOCATION_ . plants are submitted to a wide variety of environmental stresses like light drought nutrient and temperature that can induce oxidative stress through the formation of reactive oxygen species . this lead to major damages within _LOCATION_ constituents like lipids and proteins . for instance large amounts of fatty acid hydroperoxides can be formed within envelope _LOCATION_ . they can be metabolized through the ascorbate glutathione cycle . indeed we identified in arabidospis envelope _LOCATION_ several proteins that could be involved in oxidative stress responses namely a phospholipid hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidase _PROTEIN_ an ascorbate peroxydase and a superoxide dismutase . superoxide dismutase is a soluble protein that produces hydrogen peroxide . ascorbate peroxydase is also a soluble protein . it mediates hydrogen peroxide detoxification in a series of reactions coupled to the functioning of _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ selectively acts on hydroperoxides converting them to alcohols and therefore preventing lipid peroxidation . it is not very clear whether _PROTEIN_ is soluble or _LOCATION_ bound but it should be active in the vicinity of the _LOCATION_ . little is known on a possible role of chloroplast _PROTEIN_ in envelope _LOCATION_ . but the demonstration that mitochondrial _PROTEIN_ is involved in the protection from inactivation of the adenine nucleotide translocator during hypoglycemia induced apoptosis provides some clues toward the characterization of such a role in envelope _LOCATION_ . we also identified an m type thioredioxin an enzyme that can induce hydrogen peroxide tolerance in chloroplasts . unfortunately we do not know the actual target of this key enzyme in chloroplast redox network . ascorbate also serves as an antioxidant in many other detoxification reactions such as the scavenging of hydroxyl radicals and the reduction of tocopheryl radicals produced by tocopherol by quenching autocatalytic lipid peroxidation . because tocopherol is the major prenylquinone in envelope _LOCATION_ and because hydroxyl radicals can be formed by various reactions in this _LOCATION_ system the association of the ascorbate glutathione cycle to the envelope _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ is probably a physiological requirement for protecting the _LOCATION_ against harmful reactive oxygen species responsible for lipid peroxidation . furthermore the possible presence of a carotene hydroxylase in envelope _LOCATION_ is also in favor of such a role . as a matter of _PROTEIN_ davidson et al . demonstrated that a. thaliana plants in which the chyb gene that encodes carotene hydroxylase was overexpressed were more tolerant to conditions of high light and high temperature as shown by reduced lipid peroxidation . finally the damages caused to _LOCATION_ proteins submitted to an oxidative stress requires the presence of active repair _METHOD_ . we identified several proteases in arabidopsis envelope _LOCATION_ namely two members of the _PROTEIN_ dependent clp family and one of the _PROTEIN_ dependent ftsh family . indeed a possible role for these proteases could be to remove the damaged protein components from the envelope _LOCATION_ . altogether our observations demonstrate that in addition to antioxidant molecules like tocopherol a whole set of enzymes involved in prevention of oxidative stress _METHOD_ are present in chloroplast envelope _LOCATION_ . because the _LOCATION_ lumen also contains enzymes active in _LOCATION_ protection against oxidative stress these data together with ours demonstrate that both chloroplast _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ contain complex enzymatic and nonenzymatic equipment to protect the chloroplast against oxidative stress .
