nutrient signalling integrates and coordinates gene _PROTEIN_ metabolism and growth . however its primary molecular _METHOD_ remain incompletely understood in plants and animals . here we report unique signalling triggered by nitrate with live imaging of an ultrasensitive biosensor in arabidopsis leaves and roots . a nitrate sensitized and targeted functional genomic screen identifies subgroup iii sensor protein kinases as master regulators that orchestrate primary nitrate responses . a chemical switch with the engineered mutant _PROTEIN_ circumvents embryo lethality and enables conditional analyses of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ triple mutants to define comprehensive nitrate associated regulatory and developmental _METHOD_ . nitrate coupled cpk signalling phosphorylates conserved nin like protein transcription _PROTEIN_ to specify the reprogramming of gene sets for downstream transcription _PROTEIN_ transporters nitrogen assimilation _PROTEIN_ metabolism redox signalling hormones and proliferation . conditional _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants similarly impair nitrate stimulated system wide shoot growth and root establishment . the nutrient coupled signalling network integrates transcriptome and cellular metabolism with shoot root coordination and developmental plasticity in shaping organ _METHOD_ and architecture .
nitrate is the primary nitrogen source for most plants and the limiting _PROTEIN_ for growth in aerobic soil . nitrate rapidly stimulates integrated nutrient transport and assimilation as well as _PROTEIN_ metabolic and regulatory pathways that enable plant growth plasticity to respond and _PROTEIN_ to fluctuating environments . genetic and genomic evidence suggest that nitrate drives rapid transcriptional regulation and that nitrate signalling is uncoupled from nitrate metabolism . regulatory components in nitrate sensing and signalling such as the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ transceptor and associated calcineurin b like interacting protein kinases and protein phosphatase _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ as well as nitrate responsive cis elements _PROTEIN_ and transcription _PROTEIN_ have been identified by molecular genetic genomic and _METHOD_ analyses . notably arabidopsis and _PROTEIN_ have been implicated as key transcription _PROTEIN_ of primary nitrate responses . despite these advances the molecular mechanism underlying primary nitrate signalling downstream of multiple sensors to integrated transcription transport metabolism and systemic growth _METHOD_ remains unclear . is an evolutionarily conserved and versatile signalling modulator in diverse regulatory pathways such as stress immune and neuron signalling . although a role for signalling in nitrate responsive gene regulation has been implicated in maize leaves and arabidopsis roots many outstanding questions remain in both plants and animals such as whether distinct signatures are involved in primary nutrient signalling with cell specificity the specific patterns of dynamics the identity of intracellular sensors how sensors relay signalling specificity and the downstream targets of signalling in the nutrient growth regulatory networks .
