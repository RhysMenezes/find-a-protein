karyogamy or _LOCATION_ fusion is essential for sexual reproduction . in _METHOD_ karyogamy occurs three times twice during double fertilization of the egg cell and the central cell and once during female gametophyte development when the two _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ fuse to form the diploid central cell _LOCATION_ . the molecular _METHOD_ controlling karyogamy are poorly understood . we have identified nine female gametophyte mutants in arabidopsis _LOCATION_ fusion _PROTEIN_ to that are defective in fusion of the _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ . in the _PROTEIN_ to _PROTEIN_ mutants failure of fusion of the _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ is the only defect detected during megagametogenesis . _PROTEIN_ is also affected in karyogamy during double fertilization . using transmission electron microscopy we showed that _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ fail to undergo fusion of the outer _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . _PROTEIN_ contains a t dna insertion in _PROTEIN_ that is predicted to encode the mitochondrial ribosomal subunit and a wild type copy of this gene rescues the mutant phenotype . consistent with the predicted function of this gene an _PROTEIN_ green _METHOD_ protein fusion protein localizes to mitochondria and the _PROTEIN_ gene is _PROTEIN_ throughout the plant . the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants also contain t dna insertions in genes predicted to encode proteins that localize to mitochondria suggesting a role for this organelle in _LOCATION_ fusion .
during the angiosperm life cycle karyogamy occurs first during female gametophyte development when the _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ fuse and _PROTEIN_ during fertilization when the sperm _LOCATION_ fuse with the female gametophyte 's egg and central cell _LOCATION_ . therefore mutations affecting karyogamy should affect the female gametophyte and as a consequence should result in segregation distortion and reduced seed set . using these criteria we previously identified a large collection of female gametophyte mutants . within this mutant collection were nine mutants with defects in fusion of the _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ . we have named these mutants _PROTEIN_ to . analysis by confocal laser scanning microscopy _PROTEIN_ of the female gametophytes from the _PROTEIN_ to mutants is summarized in table i . in all nine mutants the _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ migrated properly but failed to fuse indicating that _LOCATION_ congression is not affected . in six of the mutants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ failure of fusion of the _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ was the only defect observed during female gametophyte development . in contrast in the other three mutants additional defects were observed . segregation analysis of the _PROTEIN_ to mutants is summarized in table ii and indicates that mutant alleles affect both the female and male gametophytes . the remainder of this article is focused on the _PROTEIN_ to _PROTEIN_ mutants that are affected specifically in fusion of the _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ during female gametophyte development . summary of _PROTEIN_ analysis of the _PROTEIN_ to mutants _PROTEIN_ female gametophyte pn _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ wt wild type . transmission of the _PROTEIN_ to mutations we next asked whether the _PROTEIN_ to _PROTEIN_ mutants are also affected in karyogamy during fertilization . the fertilization process in arabidopsis wild type has been described by citation . pollen tubes enter the female gametophyte by growing into one of the synergid cells . this synergid cell undergoes cell death just before or upon pollen tube entry . the pollen tube then releases its contents into the degenerating synergid cell and the sperm cells migrate to and fuse with the egg cell and central cell . plasmogamy triggers changes in the _PROTEIN_ and morphology of the egg cell . following plasmogamy the sperm _LOCATION_ can be observed transiently within the egg cell and the central cell . the sperm _LOCATION_ then fuse with the egg and central cell _LOCATION_ to produce the diploid zygote and triploid endosperm _LOCATION_ respectively . one to h after karyogamy the endosperm _LOCATION_ divides once to produce a binucleate endosperm . by h after pollination the endosperm consists of four to eight _LOCATION_ and the zygote remains undivided . to determine whether the nfd mutants are affected in karyogamy during fertilization we pollinated pistils from heterozygous mutants with wild type pollen and analyzed the ovules at h after pollination . in _PROTEIN_ synergid cell degeneration occurred normally and egg cell morphology was altered as it is following plasmogamy in the wild type . these features indicate that pollen tube guidance synergid cell death pollen tube entry release of pollen tube contents sperm cell migration and plasmogamy occur normally in _PROTEIN_ female gametophytes . however in contrast to wild type female gametophytes at this time point sperm _LOCATION_ were persistent within both the egg cell and the central cell and the endosperm was undivided . these data suggest that _PROTEIN_ female gametophytes are defective in karyogamy during fertilization . the other five mutants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ exhibited defects before sperm release precluding observation of karyogamy during fertilization . the unfused sperm _LOCATION_ present in _PROTEIN_ female gametophytes could be due to either a defect in karyogamy during fertilization or a delay in the fertilization process . to distinguish between these possibilities we analyzed _PROTEIN_ female gametophytes at and h after pollination . in the wild type the majority of seeds have an undivided zygote and eight endosperm _LOCATION_ at h after pollination and a globular stage embryo and > endosperm _LOCATION_ at h after pollination . in _PROTEIN_ at h after pollination sperm _LOCATION_ were still observed within the egg and central cells . at h after pollination _PROTEIN_ embryo sacs were undergoing senescence which is an indication that fertilization had not been completed . the senescence obscured observation of persistent sperm _LOCATION_ however mutant female gametophytes did not contain developing embryos or endosperm as would be the case if the _PROTEIN_ defect were due to developmental delay . together these data indicate that _PROTEIN_ female gametophytes have a defect in karyogamy during fertilization in both the egg cell and the central cell . to determine which step of karyogamy is affected in _PROTEIN_ female gametophytes we used tem to analyze the unfused _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ in this mutant . the _LOCATION_ fusion process has been characterized using tem in a wide variety of plant species . during both megagametogenesis and fertilization karyogamy occurs between intact _LOCATION_ and begins with contact of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ that are continuous with the outer _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ of the two _LOCATION_ . fusion of the _LOCATION_ results in outer _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ that are continuous . finally the inner _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ come into contact and merge resulting in a mixing of the nucleoplasm and chromosomes . we analyzed the unfused _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ in _PROTEIN_ female gametophytes at the terminal developmental stage _PROTEIN_ . consistent with our _PROTEIN_ analysis the two _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ were adjacent to each other indicating that there were no defects in _LOCATION_ congression . the _LOCATION_ envelopes were spherical except at their apposing faces where the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ were relatively flat . the outer _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ were not in contact with each other . a gap ranging in size from approximately to nm existed between the two _LOCATION_ along the entire length of the interface . these observations suggest that _PROTEIN_ female gametophytes are defective specifically in the initial step of _LOCATION_ fusion fusion of the outer _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . as shown in table ii transmission of the _PROTEIN_ mutation is also reduced through the male gametophyte . to determine whether _PROTEIN_ affects male gametophyte development or a subsequent step _LOCATION_ we analyzed mature pollen using _PROTEIN_ . as shown in figure anthers from _PROTEIN_ contained numerous collapsed pollen grains . on average of pollen grains from _PROTEIN_ plants were collapsed . by contrast wild type anthers contained only collapsed pollen grains . these data indicate that the _PROTEIN_ mutation affects male gametophyte development . the _PROTEIN_ mutant was identified in a screen of t dna mutagenized lines . to identify the gene affected in the _PROTEIN_ mutant we determined the t dna insertion site using thermal asymmetric interlaced pcr . the t dna is inserted into gene in _PROTEIN_ . to determine whether the female gametophyte defect is due to disruption of we introduced a wild type copy of this gene into the _PROTEIN_ mutant . we identified plants heterozygous for _PROTEIN_ and hemizygous for the rescue construct and crossed these as females with wild type males . in the generation _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ progeny were present in a ratio of approximately . in addition we generated plants homozygous for the _PROTEIN_ allele and homozygous for the rescue construct these plants had full seed set . these data indicate that disruption of the gene is responsible for the female gametophyte defect in _PROTEIN_ mutants . corresponds to _PROTEIN_ which is predicted to encode the mitochondrial ribosomal subunit . as shown in figure this gene spans bp contains an open reading frame of bp and encodes a protein of amino acids . the predicted protein contains a region with high similarity to the protein of escherichia coli . analysis of this protein by the targetp algorithm predicts mitochondrial localization and terminal peptide cleavage after amino acid . consistent with these predictions _PROTEIN_ has an overrepresentation of arg ala and ser and an underrepresentation of asp and glu residues in the terminus of the protein which is typical of proteins targeted to mitochondria . the gene family containing _PROTEIN_ includes only one other gene within the arabidopsis genome _GENE_ which is predicted to encode the _LOCATION_ ribosomal subunit based on the presence of chloroplast sorting motifs and similarity to the spinach _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ gene . as shown in figure the left and right borders of the t dna in _PROTEIN_ are inserted into the first and second introns of respectively and are associated with a bp deletion that removes the entire second exon which encodes amino acids to . this observation suggests that _PROTEIN_ is a null allele . however we were not able to confirm this prediction because we were unable to obtain a line homozygous for the _PROTEIN_ mutation and thus were not able to analyze _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ mutants . to determine where _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ within the plant we performed reverse transcription pcr with rna from various organs . as shown in figure a signal was detected in all tissues tested including roots _METHOD_ leaves young flowers mature stage pistils and siliques . these data indicate that _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ throughout the plant . to determine the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ we analyzed transgenic arabidopsis plants containing a protein fusion construct in which the _PROTEIN_ promoter and the entire _PROTEIN_ open reading frame were fused to a green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ coding sequence _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . in transgenic plants containing the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ construct _METHOD_ was detected in multiple small intracellular compartments . this pattern colocalized with mitotracker a _LOCATION_ specific dye . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was detected in all organs examined including roots leaves embryos and ovules . these data suggest that _PROTEIN_ protein localizes to mitochondria consistent with its predicted function as the mitochondrial ribosomal subunit . we used tail pcr to identify the t dna insertion sites in the _PROTEIN_ to _PROTEIN_ mutants . we then performed linkage studies and showed that all of the identified t dnas were linked to the mutant phenotypes . four of the genes _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ encode proteins predicted to localize to the _LOCATION_ . _PROTEIN_ is predicted to encode the ribosomal subunit and _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ do not have significant sequence similarity to any known proteins . _PROTEIN_ is predicted to encode a protein that is nodulin like . _PROTEIN_ is predicted to encode a protein that contains a ribonuclease iii domain and to localize to the endomembrane system . t dna insertion sites in the _PROTEIN_ to _PROTEIN_ mutants nd not determined .

primers to verify the t dna flanking sequences . the t dna specific primers used were for the t dna left border and _PROTEIN_ for the t dna right border . for _PROTEIN_ primer was used with gene

kanamycin . we observed kanamycin resistant _PROTEIN_ and kanamycin sensitive _PROTEIN_ progeny . plants homozygous for both the _PROTEIN_ mutation and the rescuing construct were obtained by identifying whose progeny was both kanamycin and hygromycin resistant . the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion construct has _METHOD_ inserted bp upstream of the stop codon of the _PROTEIN_ gene . as a first step in cloning this gene we generated three pcr products . an upstream fragment was amplified using primers _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . a downstream fragment was amplified using primers _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ . the _METHOD_ insert was amplified from pbi _METHOD_ using primers _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ . the _METHOD_ fragment contained the entire _METHOD_ open reading
