the kinetochore is a complex multiprotein structure located at centromeres and required for the proper segregation of chromosomes during mitosis and meiosis . an important role in kinetochore assembly and function plays the centromeric histone variant _PROTEIN_ . cell cycle stage of _PROTEIN_ deposition to centromeres varies between different _METHOD_ . we confirmed by in vivo studies that deposition of arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ takes place at centromeres during _PROTEIN_ and demonstrated that additionally a low turnover of _PROTEIN_ occurs along the cell cycle apparently for replacement of damaged protein . furthermore enhanced yellow _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ of photobleached chromocenters is not replaced by _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ molecules from unbleached centromeres of the same _LOCATION_ indicating a stable incorporation of _PROTEIN_ into centromeric nucleosomes . in differentiated endopolyploid _LOCATION_ however the amount of _PROTEIN_ at centromeres declines with age .
from previous experiments quantifying the _METHOD_ intensity of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and of endogenous _PROTEIN_ immunosignals we concluded that loading of _PROTEIN_ to plant centromeres occurs _PROTEIN_ during _PROTEIN_ . to confirm this result by an independent in vivo approach we applied long term frap analysis and quantification of _METHOD_ intensity . measurement of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ intensity starting from metaphase revealed that no additional loading of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ took place during anaphase/early _PROTEIN_ . instead _METHOD_ intensity dropped in the course of bleaching and persisted at a low level during the next min . the same observation was made when one daughter _LOCATION_ of a cell in anaphase/telophase was bleached . _METHOD_ intensities of cells that were ready to enter mitosis _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ were compared with those of surrounding cells in other cycle stages _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . this measurement has confirmed that in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ cells the amount of _PROTEIN_ is twice as high as in the surrounding cells . we followed selected cells within min in order to demonstrate that they enter mitosis . to confirm additionally that _LOCATION_ with double signals for _PROTEIN_ are in _PROTEIN_ we performed a double immunostaining experiment with anti _PROTEIN_ and anti gus antibodies on transgenic plants transformed with _PROTEIN_ gus construct . _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ during _PROTEIN_ therefore it can be used as a marker for this stage . indeed all cells showing double signals for _PROTEIN_ showed immunostaining of gus in cytoplasm or cytoplasm and _LOCATION_ . bleaching of a single _METHOD_ locus a group of loci or an entire interphase _LOCATION_ resulted in slow and incomplete _METHOD_ recovery . short term frap analysis after bleaching of single _METHOD_ loci of interphase _LOCATION_ yielded _METHOD_ recovery of up to within s . to ensure that recovery is due to replacement of damaged protein by newly synthesized one and not due to fluorophore recovery seedlings of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ transformants were fixed in formaldehyde and used for the frap . in this case no recovery was observed after photobleaching indicating that _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ bleaching is irreversible . therefore it was concluded that the _PROTEIN_ loading of _PROTEIN_ takes place during _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ because a double _METHOD_ intensity was only found in _LOCATION_ that within h had past mitosis . a slow turnover of _PROTEIN_ occurs during _PROTEIN_ to early _PROTEIN_ phase of the cell cycle in a. thaliana cells . to examine the potential mobility of _PROTEIN_ incorporated into centromeres we performed flip experiments in which individual chromocenters of _LOCATION_ were repeatedly bleached and _METHOD_ of other chromocenters was continuously measured . we observed only a very low reduction of _METHOD_ intensity at unbleached chromocenters which was within the range of reduction resulting from image scanning . these data indicate that _PROTEIN_ incorporates stably into centromeric nucleosomes and does not exchange between centromeres inside a _LOCATION_ . after we had shown that _PROTEIN_ incorporation into centromeric nucleosomes is stable we addressed the question whether the level of centromeric _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ during plant growth and development . we compared _PROTEIN_ immunostaining patterns in and _LOCATION_ isolated from young and mature leaves of a. thaliana wild type plants accession columbia . three types of immunolabeling were observed strong labeling at centromeric chromocenters and weak labeling of nucleoplasm weak labeling of chromocenters and nucleoplasm and weak nucleoplasm labeling only . about of _LOCATION_ isolated from young leaves showed strong labeling of centromeric chromocenters while only of _LOCATION_ isolated from mature leaves showed such labeling pattern . in contrast _LOCATION_ isolated from young and from mature leaves showed similar immunostaining patterns as _LOCATION_ from young leaves indicating that the found differences between _LOCATION_ are not due to poor immunostaining of _LOCATION_ from older tissues . nevertheless the percentage of _LOCATION_ with strong labeling of chromocenters was lower in differentiated than in meristematic tissues . since we observed differences in distribution of _PROTEIN_ immunostaining patterns between and _LOCATION_ of mature leaves we continued analysis with _LOCATION_ of higher ploidy levels . due to the low level of endopolyploidization in young tissues a sufficient amount of _LOCATION_ with a ploidy level higher than can be isolated only from mature leaves . we found in _LOCATION_ of mature leaves similar proportions of the three _PROTEIN_ immunostaining patterns as in _LOCATION_ . to test whether the reduction of centromeric _PROTEIN_ immunosignals in mature leaves correlates with changes in compaction of centromeric chromocentres we compared the fish signals for the centromeric bp repeat in and _LOCATION_ isolated from young and mature leaves . no differences in distribution and intensity of signals were observed between _LOCATION_ of young and mature leaves indicating that _PROTEIN_ centromeric _PROTEIN_ immunosignals are not due to dispersion or decay of centromeric dna .
generation of the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ transgenic plants has been described previously . a. thaliana seeds transformed with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ were laid out on agar medium in cover slip chambers . roots growing parallel to the cover slip bottom were analyzed in a lsm confocal microscope using a oil immersion objective . _METHOD_ was excited with a nm laser line and _METHOD_ recorded with a bandpass filter . images were collected at min intervals for up to min . at each time point single images were taken with open detector pinhole . alternatively image stacks with z steps were made with pinhole adjusted accordingly . images of z stacks were projected in maximum intensity projection . intensities of the signals were analyzed by the lsm software release . frap experiments were performed with a mw argon ion laser . roots were observed with a oil immersion objective . _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was visualized using of the nm laser line with the laser running at power in combination with a nm band pass filter and an open detector pinhole . a single prebleach image was recorded to measure prebleach intensity . for bleaching small well defined circular areas the size of an individual cell a cluster of centromeres or a single centromere were photobleached using of the laser line with three iterations to iterations . the bleaching scan lasted to s and was immediately followed by an image scan . images were taken at min intervals for up to min or at s intervals for up to min . intensities of the signals were background normalized to produce relative _METHOD_ intensity data . for _METHOD_ loss in photobleaching _LOCATION_ of interest were prescanned three times followed by additional scans alternated by bleaching of a single chromocenter . recordings were made with a oil emersion objective n.a . . for normal scanning laser power was used in combination with a pinhole scan speed was set at image size was pixels . bleaching was performed with laser power with four iterations over an area of pixels . total time of observation was s. during this period the loss of _METHOD_ was measured in the bleached area as well as in surrounding unbleached chromocenters . for the isolation of leaf _LOCATION_ plants were grown in soil in a cultivation room . leaves were fixed in formaldehyde in tris buffer for min . _LOCATION_ were isolated stained with diamidino phenylindole and processed for flow sorting according to their _METHOD_ intensity reflecting the dna content as described . _LOCATION_ of each fraction were sorted into separate eppendorf tubes subsequently dropped onto microscopy slides into a drop containing mm tris mm kcl mm and sucrose air dried and used for immunolabeling or stored at . flow cytometry was performed on the flow sorter facsaria equipped with and nm lasers . dapi emission was measured using a nm filter . immunostaining and _METHOD_ in situ hybridization of _LOCATION_ was performed as described . endogenous _PROTEIN_ was detected using rabbit antibodies against a n terminal peptide of a. thaliana _PROTEIN_ and goat anti rabbit rhodamine or goat anti rabbit alexa . gus protein _PROTEIN_ under the control of promoter _PROTEIN_ was detected with anti gus antibodies and goat anti rabbit rhodamine . as probe for fish pal harboring the bp centromere specific repeat was labeled with digoxigenin dutp by pcr with sequence specific primers forward _PROTEIN_ and reverse tggactttggctacacc _PROTEIN_ . the fish signals were detected using mouse anti dig and goat anti mouse alexa .
