correct positioning of _LOCATION_ proteins is an essential process in eukaryotic _METHOD_ . the plant hormone auxin is distributed through intercellular transport and triggers various cellular responses . auxin transporters of the _PROTEIN_ formed _PROTEIN_ family localize asymmetrically at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and mediate the directional transport of auxin between cells . a fungal toxin brefeldin a inhibits a subset of guanine nucleotide exchange _PROTEIN_ for adp ribosylation _PROTEIN_ small _PROTEIN_ including _PROTEIN_ which plays a major role in localization of _PROTEIN_ predominantly to the basal side of the pm . the arabidopsis genome encodes arf related putative _PROTEIN_ . however arf components involved in _PROTEIN_ localization have been genetically poorly defined . using a _METHOD_ imaging based forward genetic approach we identified an arabidopsis mutant bfa visualized exocytic trafficking in which pm localization of _PROTEIN_ green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ as well as development is hypersensitive to bfa . we found that in a member of the _PROTEIN_ gene family _PROTEIN_ was mutated . _PROTEIN_ localizes to the trans _LOCATION_ network/early endosome and _LOCATION_ apparatus acts synergistically to _PROTEIN_ arf gef and is important for _PROTEIN_ recycling to the pm . consistent with the developmental importance of _PROTEIN_ proteins functional interference with _PROTEIN_ resulted in an impaired auxin response gradient and various developmental defects including embryonic patterning defects and growth arrest . our results show that _PROTEIN_ is essential for recycling of _PROTEIN_ auxin transporters and for various auxin dependent developmental processes .
when _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ wild type plants were treated for a short time with bfa basally localized _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ accumulated in intracellular compartments . longer treatment with bfa is known to cause relocation of _PROTEIN_ to the apical pm _PROTEIN_ . consistent with this _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ after long term bfa treatment was _PROTEIN_ detected at the pm in wild type root vascular cells . we reasoned that this treatment allows us to perform a directed screen for exocytosis related components of the subcellular machinery . by screening approximately ethylmethane sulfonate _METHOD_ mutagenized seedlings we have identified a mutant in which clear agglomerations of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signals were detected after the long term bfa treatment and named it bfa visualized exocytosis . genetic crosses between mutant and wild type plants as well as subsequent characterization of seedlings revealed that out of seedlings showed the mutant phenotype indicating that is a dominant mutant . fig . mutant exhibits altered responses to bfa . localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in untreated seedlings and seedlings treated with bfa in liquid media . intracellular

under the same conditions the mutant accumulated _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in intracellular compartments and the pm signal was clearly reduced . this observation implies that intracellular trafficking from endosomes to the pm was affected by the mutation . to gain further insight into the intracellular trafficking defect we performed a bfa washout experiment . in wild type root vascular cells _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ accumulated in bfa compartments after treatment with bfa but the intracellular aggregates rapidly _PROTEIN_ and the pm signals were recovered when bfa was washed away . in contrast in the mutant background the recovery of pm signals was less clear after bfa washout . these results suggest that the mutation affects transport of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ including exocytic trafficking at the level of bfa sensitive compartments . next we tested if the localization of _PROTEIN_ is also affected by mutation . treatment with a low concentration of bfa caused a moderate intracellular accumulation of _PROTEIN_ in wild type root epidermal cells . in mutant cells however intracellular accumulation of _PROTEIN_ was more pronounced than in wild type cells . consistent with this observation when introduced in the mutant background _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ persisted more in the bfa compartment after bfa washout in comparison with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in control cells . as it is known that bfa at high concentrations inhibits _LOCATION_ targeting of _PROTEIN_ in the wild type background _PROTEIN_ we tested whether this process is hypersensitive in the mutant background . as shown in supplementary fig . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in the control line _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ exhibited intracellular signals typical for _LOCATION_ cargo proteins that can be visualized by keeping seedlings in darkness . consistent with previous observations _PROTEIN_ a low concentration of bfa did not visibly interfere with _LOCATION_ targeting of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in the control line . in contrast a low concentration of bfa dramatically reduced the _LOCATION_ localization of _METHOD_ signals in the mutant background suggesting that not only recycling to the pm but also _LOCATION_ targeting of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was hypersensitive to bfa . fig . cloning reveals that contains a mutation in the _PROTEIN_ gene . map position of the mutation defined by map based cloning . relative

_PROTEIN_ construct treated with bfa for h. arrows indicate strongly agglomerated _PROTEIN_ signals . in order to identify a mutation responsible for phenotypes we performed positional cloning based on the bfa hypersensitive phenotype of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ intracellular accumulation . utilizing a pcr based single nucleotide polymorphism genotyping approach we were able to identify a chromosomal location genetically linked to the bfa hypersensitive phenotype of the mutant . as a result we found a kb region on chromosome which always co segregated with the locus . sequencing of genes in this interval revealed that the open reading frame encoding _PROTEIN_ had a point mutation causing an amino acid substitution in the gene product . amino acid sequence alignment of _PROTEIN_ with small g proteins from yeast revealed that the mutated leucine residue is well conserved in different small g proteins highlighting the potential importance of this region . indeed the site of mutation is located within a domain called switch which is involved in a structural change of _PROTEIN_ upon gdp and _PROTEIN_ exchange _PROTEIN_ . because the arabidopsis genome encodes six members belonging to the _PROTEIN_ subclass which are highly conserved in _METHOD_ of amino acid sequence _PROTEIN_ the mutation might have resulted in a dominant inhibitory mutation causing a relatively strong trafficking defect . to test this possibility we created an _PROTEIN_ construct with mutation _PROTEIN_ and introduced it into wild type arabidopsis plants under the control of the _PROTEIN_ promoter . this construct recapitulated phenotypes in _METHOD_ of _PROTEIN_ localization indicating that the _PROTEIN_ mutation is responsible for the bfa hypersensitivity . _PROTEIN_ is an evolutionarily conserved small _PROTEIN_ protein which regulates intracellular trafficking at the _LOCATION_ apparatus and endosomal compartments _PROTEIN_ . currently available _METHOD_ evidence supports the roles of _PROTEIN_ in multiple trafficking processes _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and their potential developmental impact in plants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . our result is thus consistent with previously published data and indicates a clear biological relevance of _PROTEIN_ function in _PROTEIN_ protein trafficking . in arabidopsis root epidermal cells _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ co localizes with trans _LOCATION_ network /early endosome and _LOCATION_ apparatus markers . to examine the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ in more detail we performed immunolabeling experiments using anti _PROTEIN_ antibody on arabidopsis root epidermal cells _PROTEIN_ arf gefs fused to _METHOD_ reporters . the control immunostaining with this antibody resulted in punctate staining which overlapped well with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signals . _METHOD_ protein fused arf gefs _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ overlapped with anti _PROTEIN_ antibody staining . partial co localization of _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ suggests that some population of _PROTEIN_ localizes to _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ labeled compartments which might represent recycling endosomes . in addition as _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ localize to the tgn/ee and _LOCATION_ apparatus respectively these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ localizes to intracellular compartments including the tgn/ee and _LOCATION_ apparatus which are labeled with these arf gefs . fig . partially co localizes with multiple arf gefs . double labeling of root epidermal cells _PROTEIN_ arf gefs tagged with

immunostaining experiments confirmed that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ co localizes with and a _LOCATION_ marker _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . notably _PROTEIN_ did not co localize with anti bip staining which labels the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . when moderately _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ also co localized with and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ but not with bip suggesting that mutation did not abolish its native subcellular localization . however in the seedling roots with strong _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ florescence _METHOD_ signals were often observed in agglomerated endosomes which were labeled with and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . consistently immunoblotting experiments using anti _PROTEIN_ antibody confirmed that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ proteins were highly _PROTEIN_ in the transgenic lines which showed relatively strong bfa hypersensitive phenotypes . in such _PROTEIN_ overexpressing lines albeit at low frequency seedling growth was severely retarded . taken together these results suggest that mutation did not primarily affect the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ at the tgn/ee and _LOCATION_ apparatus but overexpression of the mutated protein interfered with _PROTEIN_ regulated intracellular trafficking and caused severe developmental defects . fig . of _PROTEIN_ with the mutation causes agglomeration of intracellular compartments . localization of the wild type _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and

possible role for _PROTEIN_ to function at multiple compartments together with several different arf gefs regulating intracellular trafficking processes . as shown in a the mutant overaccumulates _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in the bfa compartment upon treatment with bfa whereas intracellular agglomeration of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was not discernible in wild type and _PROTEIN_ seedling roots under the same conditions . _PROTEIN_ arf gef is involved in trafficking at the tgn/ee and required for _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ accumulation in the bfa compartment . if the mutation affects endocytic recycling of _PROTEIN_ at the same level as the site of _PROTEIN_ action and/or at a _PROTEIN_ step we expect that the _PROTEIN_ mutation is epistatic to in _METHOD_ of endocytic recycling of _PROTEIN_ protein . indeed following bfa treatment intracellular agglomeration in _PROTEIN_ double mutant cells was less pronounced as compared with the mutant suggesting that _PROTEIN_ arf gef and function in an interconnected trafficking pathway . fig . _PROTEIN_ mutation is epistatic to in _METHOD_ of endocytic recycling of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signals in untreated and bfa treated wild

cm . given the localization of _PROTEIN_ in the early endosomal pathway and potential redundancy within the _PROTEIN_ subclass we speculated that the phenotypes of the mutant might be enhanced by inactivation of the early endosomal arf gef _PROTEIN_ . intriguingly and _PROTEIN_ single mutant plants had only mild growth defects whereas _PROTEIN_ double homozygous plants were extremely small at maturity indicating the developmental importance of these two components . the bfa hypersensitive _PROTEIN_ trafficking defect of prompted us to examine whether the mutant shows any auxin related developmental defects . for this purpose we grew plants on vertical plates with solid media containing various concentrations of bfa . wild type seedlings grown at moderate bfa concentration showed only slight root growth inhibition whereas mutant seedlings stopped growing under the same conditions . _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in the wild type background resulted in a similar growth defect on bfa containing media confirming the dominant effect of _PROTEIN_ mutation on shoot and root development . in the wild type root tip the _METHOD_ auxin response reporter _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ detected in the quiescent center _PROTEIN_ and columella root cap cells and bfa treatment only slightly reduced the _METHOD_ signals . in contrast in bfa treated roots _METHOD_ was more broadly _PROTEIN_ indicating that the auxin response gradient was impaired . notably seedlings showed normal sensitivity to the auxin transport inhibitor n naphthylphthalamic acid . thus it _METHOD_ that mutants are specifically compromised in intracellular trafficking processes . fig . interference with _PROTEIN_ affects plant growth and development . gross morphology of seedlings grown on vertical solid plates

gdp or _PROTEIN_ bound state _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ a gdp locked mutant has a dominant negative effect resulting in a more dispersed localization pattern of the _PROTEIN_ component in plant cells . also _PROTEIN_ a _PROTEIN_ locked mutant inhibits root growth and root hair formation when _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis roots . we tried to uncover the additional functions of _PROTEIN_ in _METHOD_ of _PROTEIN_ trafficking and development by overexpressing the mutated _PROTEIN_ . when the _PROTEIN_ locked _PROTEIN_ mutant fused to _METHOD_ protein was _PROTEIN_ under a heat shock promoter _PROTEIN_ protein accumulated in agglomerated endosomes which were reminiscent of the bfa compartments . in contrast when wild type _PROTEIN_ or gdp locked versions of _PROTEIN_ fused to _METHOD_ proteins were _PROTEIN_ no drastic change was observed in _PROTEIN_ localization . these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ mutation has a strong inhibitory effect on _PROTEIN_ exocytosis . as _PROTEIN_ of the mutated _PROTEIN_ also inhibits _PROTEIN_ trafficking whose _PROTEIN_ localization is essential for root gravitropism we tested if the _PROTEIN_ mutants caused agravitropic root phenotypes . overexpression of the _PROTEIN_ wild type form did not interfere with root bending whereas _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ mutants with either a or mutation reduced root bending . notably this effect was not due to arrested root growth suggesting that _PROTEIN_ mutations abolished a trafficking process which is physiologically relevant for asymmetric root growth . to test further the developmental impact of the mutated _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ mutant was _PROTEIN_ under the control of a strong promoter from the _PROTEIN_ gene . when the wild type form of _PROTEIN_ driven by the _PROTEIN_ promoter was _PROTEIN_ as a control the morphology of transgenic embryos was not affected . in contrast when _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ the cell arrangement of the hypophysis was disorganized and cotyledon primordia did not develop . fig . mutation causes intracellular agglomeration of _PROTEIN_ and modifies auxin dependent gene _PROTEIN_ . effects of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_

insights into the molecular basis of those developmental defects we localized _PROTEIN_ in the malformed embryos . in control specimens the typical _PROTEIN_ localization of _PROTEIN_ protein was detected at the cell ep stage and subsequently . when mutated _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ intracellular aberrant _PROTEIN_ signals were pronounced from the early stage onwards with gradual loss of _PROTEIN_ basal localization in provascular cells and disorganization of embryonic patterning . consistent with _PROTEIN_ localization defects causing reduced directional auxin transport the typical asymmetric auxin accumulation patterns as visualized by the _METHOD_ auxin response reporter _PROTEIN_ were disrupted in _PROTEIN_ embryos . _PROTEIN_ of another auxin dependent developmental marker _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ which in the wild type situation is typically confined to lens shaped _PROTEIN_ cells was dispersed in _PROTEIN_ embryos . taken together our data indicate that disruption of _PROTEIN_ function has a strong impact on _PROTEIN_ trafficking asymmetric auxin distribution and plant development already at its early embryonic stages .
