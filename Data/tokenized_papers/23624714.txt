binding protein is a major chaperone in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ lumen and this study shows that bip binds to the c terminal tail of the stress sensor/transducer _PROTEIN_ a _LOCATION_ associated transcription _PROTEIN_ retaining it in the _LOCATION_ under unstressed conditions . in response to _LOCATION_ stress bip dissociates from _PROTEIN_ allowing it to be mobilized from the _LOCATION_ to the _LOCATION_ where it is proteolytically processed and released to enter the _LOCATION_ . under unstressed conditions bip binds to _PROTEIN_ as it binds to other client proteins through its substrate binding domain . bip dissociates from _PROTEIN_ even when _PROTEIN_ s exit from the _LOCATION_ or its release from the _LOCATION_ is blocked . both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ bind _PROTEIN_ and overexpression of either bip detains _PROTEIN_ in the _LOCATION_ under stress conditions . a c terminally truncated mutant of _PROTEIN_ eliminating most of the lumenal domain does not bind bip and is not retained in the _LOCATION_ under unstressed conditions . bip binding sites in the c terminal tail of _PROTEIN_ were identified in a phage display system . bip was found to bind to intrinsically disordered regions on _PROTEIN_ s lumen facing tail . thus the dissociation of bip from the c terminal tail of _PROTEIN_ is a major switch that activates one arm of the unfolded protein response signaling pathway in plants .
bip binds to _PROTEIN_ in unstressed arabidopsis seedlings as demonstrated by the coimmunoprecipitation of bip with myc _PROTEIN_ in transgenic lines _PROTEIN_ myc _PROTEIN_ . arabidopsis encodes three bip _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ to _PROTEIN_ that are predicted to be _LOCATION_ lumenal proteins . the anti bip antibody used in these studies does not discriminate between the bips . therefore to determine which _METHOD_ of bip bind to _PROTEIN_ we _PROTEIN_ tagged _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and used the epitope tagged _METHOD_ in immunoprecipitation experiments with myc _PROTEIN_ transiently _PROTEIN_ in nicotiana benthamiana leaves . _PROTEIN_ was not used in these experiments because _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are nearly identical in sequence . we observed that both _PROTEIN_ flg and _PROTEIN_ flg coimmunoprecipitate with myc _PROTEIN_ . we were also able to pull down myc _PROTEIN_ using bip antibodies from unstressed arabidopsis plants . these results confirmed that _PROTEIN_ does indeed interact with bip . we performed further experiments to determine the characteristics of bip binding to _PROTEIN_ . bip appears to bind myc _PROTEIN_ as it does to other client proteins . bip coimmunoprecipitated with _PROTEIN_ y star green _METHOD_ protein _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ a known bip substrate when it was _PROTEIN_ from a transgene in arabidopsis . client proteins can be released from bip by adp/atp exchange in bip s n terminal nucleotide binding domain . bip was released from myc _PROTEIN_ upon incubation of the immunoprecipitate with _PROTEIN_ and and was not released in the absence of _PROTEIN_ . in addition bip did not bind to myc _PROTEIN_ when bip s substrate binding domain was disabled by substituting pro at position for leu . in mammalian _METHOD_ the equivalent substitution of a pro for leu at position gives rise to a form that is defective in substrate binding . when arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ flg was _PROTEIN_ along with myc _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ flg did not coimmunoprecipitate with myc _PROTEIN_ . thus we concluded that under unstressed conditions bip binds to _PROTEIN_ similarly to the manner in which bip binds to other client proteins . when seedlings are treated with _LOCATION_ stress agents such as tm _PROTEIN_ is transported from the _LOCATION_ to the _LOCATION_ via the _LOCATION_ apparatus . we were interested in determining whether bip dissociates from _PROTEIN_ in response to stress and whether the dissociation of bip is correlated with other events involved in the mobilization of _PROTEIN_ . therefore we performed coimmunoprecipitations of myc _PROTEIN_ and bip during a time course of movement of _PROTEIN_ from the _LOCATION_ to the _LOCATION_ as described by citation . bip progressively dissociated from myc _PROTEIN_ during an hour after treating seedlings with tm . the loss of bip from myc _PROTEIN_ immunoprecipitates was due to dissociation and not to degradation of bip because bip levels did not decline during the time course of these experiments . at min after the start of stress treatment _PROTEIN_ begins to exit the _LOCATION_ and by h myc _PROTEIN_ was being proteolytically processed and yellow _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ appeared in the _LOCATION_ . since bip dissociation and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ movement occurred at about the same time we asked whether the dissociation of bip depends on exit of _PROTEIN_ from the _LOCATION_ . to do so we looked for the dissociation of bip from myc _PROTEIN_ a mutant that is incapable of exiting the _LOCATION_ . _PROTEIN_ has an altered pair of lys residues on the cytoplasmic side of the _LOCATION_ which impedes its interaction with _PROTEIN_ vesicle components and its exit from the _LOCATION_ . bip bound to myc _PROTEIN_ under unstressed conditions and dissociated from it following tm treatment . since it takes about an hour of tm treatment for most of bip to dissociate from wild type myc _PROTEIN_ the question can be asked whether the dissociation is only apparent because the myc tagged n terminus of _PROTEIN_ is cleaved off in the _LOCATION_ . to test this we determined whether bip dissociated from myc _PROTEIN_ a form of _PROTEIN_ that has a mutation in its transmembrane domain making it resistant to proteolytic cleavage by and incapable of being released from the _LOCATION_ . bip dissociated from myc _PROTEIN_ following tm treatment . therefore bip dissociates from _PROTEIN_ in response to _LOCATION_ stress whether or not its exit is blocked from either the _LOCATION_ or _LOCATION_ . to test whether bip retains _PROTEIN_ in the _LOCATION_ by binding to _PROTEIN_ s c terminal tail two major truncation constructs were developed _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ which eliminated most of the c terminus downstream of the _PROTEIN_ site and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ which removed most of _PROTEIN_ s c terminal tail residing in the _LOCATION_ lumen . we tested these truncations of _PROTEIN_ for their ability to bind bip in stable transgenic overexpression lines . bip bound normally to myc _PROTEIN_ but did not coimmunoprecipitate with myc _PROTEIN_ the construct lacking most of the c terminal tail . we also examined the localization and movement of _METHOD_ tagged versions of the two truncation constructs . _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was retained in the _LOCATION_ under unstressed conditions and migrated to the _LOCATION_ only when seedlings were subjected to tm stress . however _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was located in the _LOCATION_ even under unstressed conditions and also under tm stressed conditions . to demonstrate that _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ is transcriptionally active in unstressed cells we looked for the _PROTEIN_ of a _PROTEIN_ target gene _PROTEIN_ . we found that unstressed seedlings _PROTEIN_ the full length form of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ did not upregulate _PROTEIN_ but seedlings _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ upregulated _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ even under unstressed conditions . thus _PROTEIN_ does not bind to bip and is not retained in the _LOCATION_ but instead migrates to the _LOCATION_ in unstressed seedlings where it upregulates stress response genes . it is possible that the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ truncation construct fails to be retained in the _LOCATION_ by shortcutting its normal route which involves translocation through the secretion pathway to the _LOCATION_ where it would be released by _PROTEIN_ and proteolysis . to test whether _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ follows the conventional route to the _LOCATION_ we introduced this construct into an mutant background . under unstressed conditions _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was prevented from moving constitutively into the _LOCATION_ . in a wild type background and under unstressed conditions _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was observed not only in the _LOCATION_ but also in small punctate structures that colocalize with a _LOCATION_ body marker . thus _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ moved via the _LOCATION_ to the _LOCATION_ and this was prevented by blocking proteolysis of the _PROTEIN_ protein in an mutant . based on the results described above in which _PROTEIN_ bound bip and was retained in the _LOCATION_ under unstressed conditions but _PROTEIN_ did not bind bip and was not retained in the _LOCATION_ we focused on a region between these sites to identify the bip binding and _LOCATION_ retention domains . we initially attempted to use a yeast two hybrid system to study the interaction between bip and _PROTEIN_ . we had to abandon this approach due to high backgrounds in controls with the lumenal domain proteins . citation developed a means for identifying binding sites for mammalian bip based on a phage panning assay for octapeptides that bind to bip . from their findings they generated a scoring algorithm to identify potential bip binding sites . however their scoring algorithm did not allow us to unambiguously identify potential bip binding sites in the lumenal tail of _PROTEIN_ . to better identify potential bip binding sites in _PROTEIN_ we conducted phage panning experiments using purified immobilized arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ his and a phage library of overlapping peptides from the lumenal domain of _PROTEIN_ displayed in a phage display system . we subjected the overlapping peptide phage library to four rounds of panning . among the phages sequenced from the second round of panning we recovered eight of the input sequences and the phage displaying peptide led all others in frequency of recovery . in the third and fourth rounds we recovered fewer sequences but the recovered phage were enriched further for peptides and . thus in the panning assay peptides and clearly outcompeted the others in binding to immobilized _PROTEIN_ . the results of the panning were confirmed by scoring the binding of phage separately to immobilized _PROTEIN_ in an elisa assay . when the peptides were not _PROTEIN_ competitively the difference in the binding of phage displaying peptides and compared with phage displaying peptides and was more modest . nonetheless the binding of these peptides to immobilized _PROTEIN_ was comparable to the binding of phage displaying the entire region covered by the peptide library . also to demonstrate that the binding of the peptides to immobilized bip is not a contextual artifact we performed protein overlay assays . the four peptides and were fused to a glutathione s transferase _PROTEIN_ tag in a vector and _PROTEIN_ in bl cells . the _PROTEIN_ tagged peptides were pulled down using glutathione beads and loaded on _PROTEIN_ gels . the blots were probed with purified _PROTEIN_ his followed by primary and secondary antibodies to detect the binding of _PROTEIN_ to the individual peptides . the four _PROTEIN_ tagged peptides were capable of binding to _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ control and peptides that failed to bind to immobilized bip in the panning procedures did not show any binding in the overlay assays . in surveying the region covered by the phage panning analysis it was observed that the peptides that showed the greatest binding to bip were derived from regions of the _PROTEIN_ lumenal tail that had the highest tendency for disorder . in general the _PROTEIN_ c terminal tail has three broad regions labeled _PROTEIN_ to that showed greater tendency for disorder . the tendency for disorder was determined by iupred a prediction program for disorder tendency based on the estimation of stabilizing contacts in the pairwise interactions between residues . regions with fewer inter residue interactions are predicted to be intrinsically unfolded regions . the _PROTEIN_ tail peptides that showed the greatest binding affinity for _PROTEIN_ were located in _PROTEIN_ and . these regions of _PROTEIN_ showed little correlation with hydrophobicity index . it has been reported that bip tends to bind to solvent accessible hydrophobic patches on proteins . that does not appear to be case in the binding of bip to the lumenal tail of _PROTEIN_ . to determine if _PROTEIN_ bearing the _PROTEIN_ region alone at its c terminal tail could bind bip we developed another _PROTEIN_ truncated construct myc _PROTEIN_ . this construct along with _PROTEIN_ flg was coexpressed in a tobacco leaf transient _PROTEIN_ assay and it was found that _PROTEIN_ flg coimmunoprecipitated with myc _PROTEIN_ in the leaf extracts . we concluded that myc _PROTEIN_ bearing only the _PROTEIN_ region which shows tendencies for disorder can interact with bip in planta . these results also demonstrated that bip interacts independently with the different regions of the _PROTEIN_ lumen facing tail . we manipulated the levels of bip _PROTEIN_ to explore its impact on _PROTEIN_ mobilization . arabidopsis has three bip genes but since _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are nearly identical we overexpressed _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ with the promoter in lines containing _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . to demonstrate that the overexpressed _METHOD_ are appropriately localized at the subcellular level we showed that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ hdel colocalized with an _LOCATION_ marker spmcherry . in the wild type lines _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was located in the _LOCATION_ in unstressed seedlings and translocated to _LOCATION_ after h of tm treatment . however in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ overexpressors most _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was retained in the _LOCATION_ even after h of tm treatment . although _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were overexpressed tm treatment still induced _LOCATION_ stress as evidenced by the splicing of _PROTEIN_ . nonetheless _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ overexpression interfered with the release of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ from the _LOCATION_ . as a control we showed that overexpression of _PROTEIN_ flg the construct that is defective in substrate binding did not prevent _PROTEIN_ s movement to _LOCATION_ following stress treatment . to determine if we could further restrain the stress mobilization of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ by preventing its dissociation from bip we introduced into arabidopsis mutated _METHOD_ of bip that are known in other _METHOD_ to interfere with _PROTEIN_ binding and the release of client proteins . in response to tm induced stress the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ transgenes appeared to prevent the dissociation from myc _PROTEIN_ in pull down experiments . the overexpression of _PROTEIN_ with reduced capacity for client protein dissociation prevented the processing of myc _PROTEIN_ in response to dtt treatment and also effectively blocked the _LOCATION_ relocation of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in response to tm induced stress . dtt and not tm was used as a stress agent in this experiment because tm treatment produces additional nonglycosylated _METHOD_ of myc _PROTEIN_ that make the gel patterns difficult to interpret . in our hands dtt has been just as effective as tm in eliciting _LOCATION_ stress . the overexpression _PROTEIN_ similarly prevented the relocation of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ to _LOCATION_ in response to tm induced stress . thus we conclude that overexpression of bip particularly _METHOD_ of bip that interfere with the release of client proteins prevents the normal mobilization of _PROTEIN_ from the _LOCATION_ to the _LOCATION_ by binding to _PROTEIN_ and not allowing its release . similar experiments were conducted in bip knockout lines containing _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . our interest here was whether the knockout of bip genes would prevent the retention of _PROTEIN_ in the _LOCATION_ under unstressed conditions . homozygous t dna insertion lines are available for all three bip genes however multiple mutants such as the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant are not viable . in an effort to reduce bip levels as much as possible we obtained lines homozygous for either _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ but heterozygous for the other locus as described by citation . the _PROTEIN_ t dna homozygous insertion line _PROTEIN_ was obtained from the nottingham arabidopsis stock centre and found not to produce _PROTEIN_ transcripts under stress conditions . compared with the wild type detectable amounts of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ escaped from the _LOCATION_ to _LOCATION_ under unstressed conditions in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutant lines indicating a reduced ability of the bip knockout mutants to retain _PROTEIN_ in the _LOCATION_ . we observed processed myc _PROTEIN_ in the various knockout mutant lines under unstressed conditions confirming these results and indicating that _PROTEIN_ is constitutively activated in these lines .
