animal and yeast nucleolin function as global regulators of ribosome synthesis and their _PROTEIN_ is tightly linked to cell proliferation . although arabidopsis contains two genes for nucleolin atnuc is the predominant if not only form of the protein found in most tissues and _METHOD_ atnuc fusion proteins were targeted to the nucleolus . _PROTEIN_ of atnuc was strongly induced by sucrose or _PROTEIN_ but not by non metabolizable mannitol or deoxyglucose . sucrose also caused enhanced _PROTEIN_ of genes for subunits of c/d and h/aca small nucleolar ribonucleoproteins as well as a large number of genes for ribosomal proteins suggesting that _PROTEIN_ availability regulates de novo ribosome synthesis . in sugar starved cells induction of atnuc occurred with mm _PROTEIN_ which seemed to be a prerequisite for resumption of growth . disruption of atnuc caused an increased steady state level of pre rrna relative to mature rrna and resulted in various phenotypes that overlap those reported for several rp gene mutants including a reduced growth rate prolonged lifetime bushy growth pointed leaf and defective vascular patterns and pod development . these results suggest that the rate of ribosome synthesis in the meristem has a strong impact not only on the growth but also the structure of plants . the atnuc disruptant exhibited significantly reduced sugar induced _PROTEIN_ of rp genes suggesting that atnuc is involved in the sugar inducible _PROTEIN_ of rp genes .
of the sugar induced genes that we identified by microarray analysis a gene encoding nucleolin was one of the most strongly induced by suc within h. this gene encodes a protein with structural similarities to of saccharomyces cerevisiae and of schizosaccharomyces pombe as well as nucleolins from alfalfa and pea . the arabidopsis genome also contains another gene for nucleolin _GENE_ . the proteins encoded by _GENE_ and _GENE_ are identical with atnuc and atnuc respectively described previously . the atnuc and atnuc genes are located on segment a large duplicated segment between chromosomes and respectively . although both atnuc and atnuc contain two _METHOD_ the atnuc gene is interrupted by introns whereas the atnuc gene contains introns . atnuc mrna was detected in various organs of col plants by rt pcr . in contrast little atnuc mrna was detected in organs other than flower buds . genes encoding fusion proteins with _METHOD_ at either the c terminus _METHOD_ or n terminus _METHOD_ of atnuc were placed downstream of the camv promoter and used to generate stably transformed tobacco by cells . in cells _PROTEIN_ atnuc _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ atnuc strong _METHOD_ _METHOD_ signals were detected in nucleoli and absent from the cytoplasm . weak _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was also detected in the nucleoplasm where _METHOD_ occasionally appeared as spots . in contrast signals were absent in nucleoli of cells _PROTEIN_ free _METHOD_ . in roots of arabidopsis plants transformed with these fusion genes strong _METHOD_ _METHOD_ appeared in nucleoli . figure shows the time course of changes in the level of atnuc mrna after treatment of leaves of arabidopsis col seedlings with mm suc or in the dark . the level of atnuc mrna started to increase after h of suc treatment and reached a maximum after h whereas it did not change after treatment with . a h treatment with mm glc also caused an increase in the level of atnuc mrna however non metabolizable o methyl d _PROTEIN_ and deoxy d _PROTEIN_ as well as mm mannitol and aba were ineffective in inducing atnuc mrna . similar results were obtained by treatment of seedlings with sugars . trehalose metabolism plays important roles in sugar sensing and plant development . neither germination of seeds on medium containing trehalose nor treatment of seedlings with trehalose affected the level of atnuc mrna . under the conditions employed trehalose induced _PROTEIN_ mrna for starch synthesis as reported previously . we also examined the _PROTEIN_ of atnuc in suspension cultured arabidopsis cells . exponentially growing cells were starved of sugars for h after which the cells were cultured in medium containing various concentrations of glc for h. as shown in figure mm glc resulted in induction of a nearly maximal level of atnuc mrna but did not affect the level of _PROTEIN_ mrna . for sugar starved cells mm glc was sufficient to induce the resumption of growth but the growth rates were higher at and mm glc . animal and yeast nucleolin are involved in correct modification and processing of pre rrna . the site specific cleavage and base pseudo uridylation of pre rrna is mediated by the h/aca small nucleolar ribonucleoprotein complex which contains in the case of yeast s. cerevisiae _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and snornas while the site specific cleavage and o methylation of pre rrna requires c/d snornp which is composed of _PROTEIN_ and snornas . if sugar induced _PROTEIN_ of atnuc plays a role in the enhanced processing and base modification of pre rrna the _PROTEIN_ of genes for the subunits of h/aca and c/d snornps should also be upregulated by sugar . among the subunits of h/aca snornp an arabidopsis homolog of _PROTEIN_ has been characterized . the predicted arabidopsis gene encodes a amino acid like protein that has amino acid identity with the amino acid protein . in addition _GENE_ is also predicted to encode a amino acid protein that has amino acid identity with . the predicted gene _GENE_ encodes a amino acid protein that has amino acid identity with the amino acid protein while _GENE_ is predicted to encode a amino acid protein that has amino acid identity with _PROTEIN_ . furthermore the arabidopsis genome includes two genes for fibrillarin _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . although a third gene can encode a protein that has identity with _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ this gene does not appear to be _PROTEIN_ . two predicted genes _GENE_ and _GENE_ are predicted to encode amino acid proteins that have identities with the amino acid protein . similarly two predicted genes and _GENE_ encode proteins of and amino acids respectively both of which share approximately identity with the amino acid _PROTEIN_ . the arabidopsis genome also contains three putative genes that encode amino acid proteins that share identity with the amino acid . we examined our microarray data to determine whether sugar induces the _PROTEIN_ of genes encoding subunits of the h/aca and c/d snornp complexes . in these analyses we analyzed three independently isolated pairs of rna samples from col seedlings that had been treated with suc or for h in the dark using agilent arabidopsis and oligo microarrays . for each pair of rnas the array data after dye swapping of and labeling were averaged . the results from two representative arrays are shown in figure . among the predicted genes analyzed atnuc and did not give significant signals . one of the two genes for like protein _GENE_ and showed signals that did not vary between suc and treated plants . however all the other genes showed suc induced increases in the mrna level . in addition to atnuc suc caused an approximately fold increase in the level of _PROTEIN_ mrna . other genes showed fold increases by suc treatment . to confirm the microarray data we examined the levels of several mrnas by quantitative real time rt pcr . in addition to an fold induction of atnuc mrna by suc the levels of mrnas for _PROTEIN_ and were fold higher in seedlings treated with suc than those treated with . in contrast to genes encoding subunits of h/aca and c/d snornp complexes suc did not increase the mrna levels for the putative genes encoding the subunits of and snrnp complexes which are involved in intron splicing of pre mrnas . to determine whether the induction of atnuc mrna by sugar is accompanied by an increase in the level of protein we extracted proteins from seedlings that had been treated with suc or for h and analyzed them by immunoblotting with an anti atnuc antibody . the anti atnuc antibody reacted with an approximately kda polypeptide which is larger than the expected molecular _METHOD_ of kda . in addition the antibody revealed a weaker band of approximately kda . the intensities of both bands were stronger in extracts from suc treated seedlings than those from treated seedlings . we also examined levels of fibrillarin using an anti atfib antibody and those of the putative protein using an antibody against a tobacco homolog of . the anti atfib antibody detected a single band with an apparent molecular _METHOD_ of kda . despite the induction of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mrnas by suc the intensity of this kda band did not differ between the and suc treated seedlings . the anti antibody reacted with a single band with an apparent molecular _METHOD_ of kda that appeared to be increased in the suc treated plants . we searched for t dna insertion lines of atnuc in the kazusa t dna tag line collection by pcr screening of pooled chromosomal dna and identified a line in which t dna was inserted in the second intron . in this mutant in the col background we detected neither atnuc mrna by rt pcr nor atnuc protein by immunoblotting with an anti atnuc antibody . the pre rrna contains a external transcribed sequence internal transcribed sequences and _PROTEIN_ and a ets which are removed during a complex series of maturation steps . to examine the effects of atnuc deficiency on the processing of pre rrna we compared the levels of corresponding rna sequences between col and plants by real time rt pcr using primers specific to various regions of the pre rrna . to quantify ets and its sequences of rna was used as a template for the first strand cdna synthesis whereas ng of rna was used for quantification of mature rrna sequences . we normalized the signal values for each pcr product against the values for rrna and then compared the relative values for col and plants . we found that the relative levels of the ets _PROTEIN_ and ets sequences were fold higher in plants than in col plants suggesting that the steady state level of pre rrna relative to mature rrna is higher in than in col plants . the plants showed various growth and developmental phenotypes . the growth of roots of germinated on vertically placed agar plates was slower than that of col seedlings and the above ground parts of seedlings grown on agar plates were stunted . the plants also grew more slowly than col plants on vermiculite . they often showed outgrowth of organs from axillary buds bushy growth with many _METHOD_ and a longer life duration compared with the col plants . the leaves of young seedlings had a narrow pointed shape in contrast to the round shape of col leaves and showed abnormal vascular patterns . in addition to the reduced growth rate these phenotypes are similar to those commonly observed for mutants with disruptions of rp genes such as pointed first leaf in which _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is disrupted arabidopsisminute like _PROTEIN_ in which _PROTEIN_ is disrupted and short valve _PROTEIN_ in which is disrupted . in addition pods of plants were shorter and irregular in size and shape compared with those of col plants . furthermore the stalks of the pods were longer than those of col pods . a long stalk is a characteristic feature of the pods from the _PROTEIN_ mutant as well as those from mutants of auxin response _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and monopteros which are defective in gynoecium development . encoded by _PROTEIN_ is specifically involved in translation re initiation of polycistronic mrnas and disruption of affects the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ and monopteros genes which contain upstream open reading frames in their untranslated sequences . these results suggest that plants contain a reduced amount of rps due to defective ribosome synthesis and suffer from a shortage of ribosomes in proliferating cells . because plants seemed to contain a reduced amount of ribosomes and rps we examined the _PROTEIN_ of rp genes in these plants . figure shows the scatter plots of representative microarray data for transcript levels of col and seedlings treated with suc or . similar results were obtained in three independent experiments for col plants and two independent experiments for plants . in arabidopsis each of the rps are encoded by a small family of members . in figure the rp genes are indicated by pink triangles . in col plants the mrna levels for of the rp genes were increased more than twofold in suc treated plants compared with treated plants . in contrast the mrna level for none of the rp genes was increased more than twofold by suc in the plants . for example the mrnas for and were increased two to fivefold in col plants treated with suc compared to plants treated with whereas there was no noticeable induction by suc in plants . the signal values for rp transcripts in treated seedlings were not noticeably different between col and suggesting that the nucleolin deficiency affected the sugar induced increase in rp mrnas . on average suc treatment caused a fold increase in the levels of the rp mrnas in col plants but only a fold difference in plants . comparison of the scatter plots for col and plants suggests that there was a general reduction in the magnitude of sugar responsive changes in the mrna level in plants . nevertheless _PROTEIN_ of typical sugar inducible genes such as amylase adp _PROTEIN_ pyrophosphorylase s starch branching enzyme keto acyl coa thiolase and the _PROTEIN_ transcription _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was not noticeably affected by the disruption of atnuc . similarly sugar repression of mrnas for a putative xylosidase peroxidase glycolate oxidase _PROTEIN_ and a putative peptide transporter were not noticeably affected by the disruption of atnuc . these results suggest that the reduction in sugar inducible _PROTEIN_ of rp genes in is selective .
