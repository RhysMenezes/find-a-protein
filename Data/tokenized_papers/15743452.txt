the mechanism by which _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ proteins are transported to _LOCATION_ for degradation has not been well characterized in plants . to clarify how _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ proteins are degraded we monitored the endocytotic pathway in tobacco suspension cultured by cells with a _METHOD_ endocytosis marker . because of the efficient and rapid delivery of endosomes to the _LOCATION_ endosomes were scarcely detectable . interestingly we found that e an inhibitor of papain family proteases caused the accumulation of a large number of endosomes in the cells under the sucrose starved condition . this result indicates that e attenuates the fusion of endosomes with _LOCATION_ . we identified two papain homologues which are localized in the endosomes with a biotinylated inhibitor . we designated them as endosome localized papains _PROTEIN_ . _METHOD_ analysis revealed that _LOCATION_ sorting receptor a marker of prevacuolar compartment was localized in the endosomes . this result and their acidic nature show that the endosomes correspond to pvc . these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ facilitate the final step in the _LOCATION_ trafficking pathway under the sucrose starved condition . we further examined the effects of e on two transgenic arabidopsis plants that constitutively _PROTEIN_ a fusion protein composed of green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ and a _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ protein _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was observed on the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ of root cells in these transgenic plants . treatment with e induced the accumulation of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ endosomes and inhibited the degradation of these fusion proteins . no _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was observed in _LOCATION_ in e treated transgenic plants . taken together these results suggest that endosomal proteases are required for the fusion of endosomes with _LOCATION_ at the final step in the endocytotic pathway for degradation of _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ proteins in plants .
