_PROTEIN_ an arabidopsis homolog plays a critical role in _LOCATION_ trafficking in plant cells . in this study we investigated the localization of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ two arabidopsis proteins that have highly similar amino acid sequence homology to in animal cells . both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ gave a punctate staining pattern and colocalized when transiently _PROTEIN_ as _METHOD_ _METHOD_ or small epitope tagged _METHOD_ in arabidopsis protoplasts . in protoplasts transiently _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ colocalized with _PROTEIN_ and vsrat two proteins that are known to be present at the prevacuolar compartment . furthermore endogenous _PROTEIN_ also gave a punctate staining pattern and colocalized with _PROTEIN_ to the pvc . mutations in the first and second _PROTEIN_ binding motifs alter the localizations of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in the _LOCATION_ and _PROTEIN_ in the tonoplast of the central _LOCATION_ . also mutations in the effector domain and the prenylation site inhibit _LOCATION_ association of _PROTEIN_ . based on these results we propose that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ localize to the pvc and that _PROTEIN_ binding motifs as well as the effector domain are important for localization of _PROTEIN_ to the pvc .
_PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ have highly similar amino acid sequences to each other and to the protein found in animal cells . we recently demonstrated that they play a critical role in _LOCATION_ trafficking in plant cells . to advance our understanding of their role in _LOCATION_ trafficking we examined their localization . we used in vivo targeting approaches in protoplasts using green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ tagged fusion proteins _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . rab proteins have previously been shown to localize correctly at their target _LOCATION_ when fused with _METHOD_ . the two constructs _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ were introduced into protoplasts obtained from arabidopsis leaf tissues and the localization of these proteins was examined at various time points after transformation . as shown in fig . _METHOD_ signals from _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in most of the transformed protoplasts appeared as punctate stains . the punctate staining pattern of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was also demonstrated previously . the nearly identical staining pattern of these two proteins suggests that they localize to the same compartment . to confirm that the _METHOD_ tag of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ does not affect the localization of _PROTEIN_ we assessed the localization of _PROTEIN_ tagged with the influenza virus hemagglutinin a epitope at its n terminus . protoplasts were cotransformed with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and ha _PROTEIN_ . the localization of ha _PROTEIN_ was examined by immunohistochemistry using anti ha antibody and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was directly observed using green _METHOD_ from the fixed cell . as shown in fig . the green _METHOD_ signals of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ closely overlapped the red _METHOD_ signals of ha _PROTEIN_ detected by an anti ha antibody . next we determined whether _PROTEIN_ colocalizes with _PROTEIN_ . protoplasts were transformed with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and ha _PROTEIN_ and localization of these proteins was examined . as shown in fig . the punctate staining patterns of ha _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ closely overlapped indicating that both proteins localize to the same compartment . to confirm the _PROTEIN_ of ha _PROTEIN_ in protoplasts as well as the specificity of the anti ha antibody protein extracts from protoplasts transformed with ha _PROTEIN_ were analyzed by western blot . as shown in fig . the antibody detected a specific band at kda the expected position of ha _PROTEIN_ in transformed protoplasts but not in untransformed protoplasts confirming the _PROTEIN_ of ha _PROTEIN_ and the specificity of the anti ha antibody . we then identified the organelles to which these proteins localize . since _PROTEIN_ is critical in _LOCATION_ trafficking we first determined whether the punctate staining pattern represents the pvc by comparing the localization of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ a marker of the pvc . _PROTEIN_ was tagged with the ha epitope to detect its _PROTEIN_ with the anti ha antibody . first we examined _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ by western blot analysis . as shown in fig . a kda protein band the expected position of _PROTEIN_ ha was specifically detected from protein extracts obtained from protoplasts transformed with _PROTEIN_ ha but not from untransformed protoplasts confirming _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ ha in protoplasts . next we examined localization of _PROTEIN_ ha in protoplasts cotransformed with _PROTEIN_ ha and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ ha was detected by immunohistochemistry using anti ha antibody . _PROTEIN_ ha stained in a punctate pattern as observed previously with _PROTEIN_ . in addition red _METHOD_ signals of _PROTEIN_ ha closely overlapped green _METHOD_ signals of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . furthermore the _METHOD_ signals of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ closely overlapped the red signals of _PROTEIN_ ha at the punctate stains in protoplasts cotransformed with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ ha . next we quantified the degree of overlap between _PROTEIN_ ha and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and between ha and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . as shown in fig . over of both _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ positive punctate stains overlapped with those of _PROTEIN_ ha . only a minor fraction of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ did not colocalize with _PROTEIN_ ha . one possible explanation is that a minor portion of _PROTEIN_ may localize to other compartments . these results strongly suggest that both _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ colocalize to the pvc . for additional confirmation we compared the localization of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ with that of the endogenous arabidopsis _LOCATION_ sorting receptor an arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ homolog _PROTEIN_ . vsr proteins are predominantly concentrated on the pvcs in root tip cells and tobacco by suspension culture cells . thus the anti vsr antibody raised against vsrat serves as a pvc marker . previously this antibody had been used to detect vsr homolog in by cells and shown to recognize specifically a protein band at kda . furthermore it had been shown to colocalize with _PROTEIN_ at the pvc . when we performed western blot analysis with protein extracts obtained from leaf tissues of arabidopsis it also specifically recognized an kda band an expected size of arabidopsis vsr . next we examined the staining pattern of vsrat using the anti vsr antibody . as shown in fig . endogenous vsrat stained in a punctate pattern in leaf protoplasts as observed in root tip and tobacco by cells . as a control for immunostaining a control rabbit serum was used and did not give any staining confirming the specificity of anti vsr antibody . to examine whether _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ colocalizes with vsrat protoplasts transformed with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ were stained with the anti vsr antibody . as shown in fig . the green punctate stains of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ closely overlapped the red punctate stains of vsrat . however a fraction of red punctate vsrat stains did not overlap _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ speckles indicating that _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ may colocalize with most but not all of the vsr positive compartments . previously it has been shown that vsr also localizes to the tgn . next we examined the degree of vsrat colocalization with _PROTEIN_ to determine what portion of the vsr positive speckles corresponds to the pvc in arabidopsis leaf cells . protoplasts were transformed with _PROTEIN_ ha and stained using anti ha and anti vsr antibodies . as shown in fig . the majority of vsr positive speckles overlapped the _PROTEIN_ ha speckles confirming that majority of vsr localizes to the pvc . when overlap of vsrat with _PROTEIN_ ha was quantified of vsrat positive speckles colocalized with the pvc indicating that of vsrat positive speckles represent the pvc . these results confirm that _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ localizes _PROTEIN_ to the pvc . to rule out the possibility that _PROTEIN_ localizes to the tgn we compared the staining patterns of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ with that of ha tagged _PROTEIN_ a protein localized to the tgn . protoplasts were cotransformed with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and ha and localization of these two proteins was examined . _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ did not colocalize with ha indicating that ha _PROTEIN_ does not localize to the tgn . to further confirm the specific localization of _PROTEIN_ at the pvc we compared the localization of _PROTEIN_ with that of other markers that characterize organelles such as the _LOCATION_ mitochondria and the _LOCATION_ . _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was introduced into protoplasts together with bip _METHOD_ a marker of the _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ a marker of mitochondria or _METHOD_ skl a marker of the _LOCATION_ and the localizations of the different proteins were examined . as shown in fig . bip _METHOD_ gave a network pattern as observed previously . furthermore _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ skl gave punctate staining patterns as expected . none of these markers overlapped with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ thus excluding the possibility that _PROTEIN_ localizes to any of these organelles . to further confirm the localization of _PROTEIN_ we investigated the localization of endogenous _PROTEIN_ using a polyclonal anti _PROTEIN_ antibody . to address this question we raised a rabbit polyclonal antibody against recombinant _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in escherichia coli . first we examined the specificity of the anti _PROTEIN_ antibody . as shown in fig . _PROTEIN_ anti _PROTEIN_ antibody specifically detected a protein band at kda from total protein extracts obtained from leaf tissues whereas the control serum did not detect any protein species from the extracts indicating that the antibody may specifically detect _PROTEIN_ from plant extracts . next we examined whether anti _PROTEIN_ antibody recognizes _PROTEIN_ only and does not cross react with other rab proteins in arabidopsis . since the _PROTEIN_ of rab proteins has not been previously investigated in arabidopsis leaf cells protein extracts were prepared from protoplasts transformed with various _METHOD_ tagged _METHOD_ of rab such as _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . we evaluated the _PROTEIN_ of these proteins by western blot analysis using an anti _METHOD_ antibody . as shown in fig . a protein band around kda was detected in each lane indicating that these proteins are _PROTEIN_ in protoplasts . to examine the cross reactivity of the anti _PROTEIN_ antibody with these proteins western blot analysis was performed with these protein extracts using anti _PROTEIN_ antibody . as shown in fig . the anti _PROTEIN_ antibody strongly detected a protein band at kda in the protein extracts containing _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . also _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was weakly detected the amino acid sequences of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are homologous . these results clearly demonstrated that the anti _PROTEIN_ antibody is highly specific to _PROTEIN_ among rab proteins in arabidopsis . we examined the localization of endogenous _PROTEIN_ by immunohistochemistry using the anti _PROTEIN_ antibody . as shown in fig . endogenous _PROTEIN_ gave a punctate staining pattern as observed with transiently _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ or ha _PROTEIN_ . in contrast the control serum did not give any staining pattern . next we examined whether endogenous _PROTEIN_ colocalizes with transiently _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ or ha _PROTEIN_ . protoplasts transformed with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ or ha _PROTEIN_ were stained with the anti _PROTEIN_ antibody alone or with anti _PROTEIN_ and anti ha antibodies respectively . endogenous _PROTEIN_ closely overlapped _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and ha _PROTEIN_ at punctate stains indicating that endogenous _PROTEIN_ colocalizes with _METHOD_ or ha tagged _PROTEIN_ proteins at the same compartment . to confirm the localization of endogenous _PROTEIN_ to the pvc we investigated the colocalization of endogenous _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ ha . protoplasts were transformed with _PROTEIN_ ha and localization of _PROTEIN_ ha and endogenous _PROTEIN_ was examined . as shown in fig . both _PROTEIN_ ha and endogenous _PROTEIN_ gave a punctate staining pattern . furthermore endogenous _PROTEIN_ closely overlapped _PROTEIN_ ha at punctate stains confirming that endogenous _PROTEIN_ localizes to the pvc as observed with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and ha _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ transiently in protoplasts . to further elucidate the behavior of _PROTEIN_ we examined the subcellular distribution pattern of endogenous and transiently _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ by western blot analysis . protein extracts were obtained from untransformed protoplasts or protoplasts transformed with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and fractionated into soluble and _LOCATION_ fractions by ultracentrifugation . the presence of endogenous _PROTEIN_ or transiently _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was detected in these fractions by western blot analysis . as shown in fig . the majority of endogenous _PROTEIN_ was detected in the pellet fraction indicating that _PROTEIN_ is associated with cellular _LOCATION_ . also the majority of the transiently _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was also detected in the _LOCATION_ fraction . however interestingly more _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ than endogenous _PROTEIN_ was detected in the soluble fraction which is likely due to overexpression of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in the cell . as a control protein extracts prepared from protoplasts transformed with a _METHOD_ construct were fractionated and examined by western blot analysis using anti _METHOD_ antibody . as shown in fig . _METHOD_ was detected _PROTEIN_ in the soluble fraction indicating that the presence of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in the _LOCATION_ fraction is due to _PROTEIN_ . also we detected endogenous arabidopsis aleurain like protein _PROTEIN_ a soluble _LOCATION_ protein using anti aleurain antibody raised against barley aleurain . endogenous _PROTEIN_ was detected in the soluble fraction but not in the _LOCATION_ fraction . these results strongly suggest that endogenous _PROTEIN_ is associated with _LOCATION_ . furthermore these results strongly suggest that transiently _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ behaves similarly to endogenous _PROTEIN_ . next to obtain independent evidence for the localization of _PROTEIN_ at the pvc we examined the sedimentation pattern of _PROTEIN_ on a continuous sucrose gradient . first a microsomal _LOCATION_ fraction of leaf cell extracts was prepared by ultracentrifugation and loaded onto a continuous sucrose gradient . after centrifugation fractions were analyzed by western blot analysis using various antibodies such as anti bip anti _PROTEIN_ anti _PROTEIN_ and anti _PROTEIN_ . anti bip and anti _PROTEIN_ antibodies were used to detect the _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ apparatus . as shown in fig . anti _PROTEIN_ and anti _PROTEIN_ antibodies gave nearly identical distribution patterns with a major peak between and sucrose . however the distribution pattern of _PROTEIN_ was different from those of bip and _PROTEIN_ at the _LOCATION_ and the _LOCATION_ apparatus . these results further confirm that _PROTEIN_ localizes to the pvc . next we examined the targeting mechanism of _PROTEIN_ to the pvc . rab proteins have multiple domains such as _PROTEIN_ binding and effector domains . mutations at these domains are known to affect protein targeting . mutations were introduced at the highly conserved _PROTEIN_ binding motifs namely the first _PROTEIN_ and second _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ binding motifs . we fused these mutants with _METHOD_ and then examined their localization in transformed protoplasts . the _METHOD_ signals of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ were diffuse as observed with _METHOD_ alone indicating that this mutation inhibits the targeting of _PROTEIN_ to the pvc . in contrast _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ showed strong _METHOD_ signals at the tonoplast of the central _LOCATION_ and also at a few punctate stains suggesting that the highly conserved _PROTEIN_ domains of _PROTEIN_ are critical for proper localization of _PROTEIN_ to the pvc . to further understand the targeting mechanism of _PROTEIN_ to the pvc mutations were introduced at the effector domain _PROTEIN_ and the prenylation site _PROTEIN_ . these mutants were again fused with _METHOD_ and their localization was examined in transformed protoplasts . the _METHOD_ signals of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ were diffuse as observed with _METHOD_ alone . thus the effector domain and prenylation site of _PROTEIN_ play critical roles in the proper localization of _PROTEIN_ to the pvc . to confirm the behavior of the _PROTEIN_ mutants protein extracts were prepared from protoplasts transformed with the mutant and wild type _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ constructs . the protein extracts were then fractionated into soluble and _LOCATION_ fractions by ultracentrifugation and probed with a monoclonal anti _METHOD_ antibody for the presence of _PROTEIN_ . as shown in fig . in contrast to _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ the majority of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was present in the soluble fraction with a minor portion in the _LOCATION_ fraction confirming the image pattern observed under a _METHOD_ microscope . however the distribution of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was exactly opposite to that of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ the majority of the protein was present in the _LOCATION_ fraction and only a minor portion was in the soluble fraction . when subcellular fractionation experiments were performed with _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ these mutant proteins were detected in the soluble fraction but not in the _LOCATION_ fraction confirming the data obtained from image analysis . these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ targeting to the pvc is dependent on both the effector domain and the prenylation site . the prenyl group at the c terminal cysteine residues anchors the rab protein to the _LOCATION_ .
arabidopsis was grown on murashige and skoog plates in a growth chamber . leaf tissues were harvested from the plants and immediately used for protoplast isolation . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were pcr amplified . the primer sets were as follows aagaagaatgaattttaatct and tcaagttgagcagcagcc for _PROTEIN_ cccgggaaatgtcagacgacgag and _PROTEIN_ for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and tcagcaagcacaacctcctctt for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and ctaaacgtaactacagcaagc for _PROTEIN_ . point mutants of _PROTEIN_ were also generated by pcr . _PROTEIN_ was generated by pcr using two oligonucleotide primers _PROTEIN_ and caaactgtggtatcgttccagaccagctgtatcccatat . the nucleotide sequences of all the pcr products were confirmed by nucleotide sequencing . cdna was pcr amplified from a cdna library using gene specific primers . to prepare cell extracts from protoplasts transformed protoplasts were lysed in buffer by repeated freeze and thaw cycles and then centrifuged at at for min in a microfuge to remove cell debris . for subcellular fractionation experiments the total cell extracts were centrifuged at for min and subsequently the resulting supernatant was fractionated into soluble and _LOCATION_ fractions by ultracentrifugation at for h . for fractionation of _LOCATION_ proteins on a continuous sucrose gradient the microsomal _LOCATION_ fraction was further fractionated on a continuous sucrose gradient by ultracentrifugation at for h. these fractions were then probed with anti bip anti _PROTEIN_ anti _PROTEIN_ and anti _PROTEIN_ antibodies as described previously . prset _PROTEIN_ an e. coli _PROTEIN_ vector for _PROTEIN_ was constructed by inserting the _PROTEIN_ cdna into the multi cloning site of prset b in frame with the his tag . a recombinant protein his tagged _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ in e. coli and purified using an ni _PROTEIN_ column according to the manufacturer s instructions . affinity purified recombinant protein was then used to immunize two rabbits . antibody was affinity purified using recombinant protein as described previously . the plasmids were introduced by peg mediated transformation into arabidopsis protoplasts prepared from leaf tissues . _PROTEIN_ of the fusion constructs was monitored at various time points after transformation and images were captured with a cooled ccd camera and a zeiss axioplan _METHOD_ microscope . also images were obtained using a confocal laser scanning microscope . protoplasts were analyzed immunohistochemically as described previously . briefly transformed protoplasts were placed onto poly l lysine coated slide glasses and fixed with paraformaldehyde in a fixing buffer for h at room temperature . the fixed cells were incubated with rat monoclonal anti ha rabbit anti _PROTEIN_ or rabbit anti vsr antibodies at overnight and washed with _PROTEIN_ buffer three times . subsequently the cells were incubated with conjugated goat anti rabbit igg or _PROTEIN_ conjugated anti rat igg as the secondary antibodies . the images were captured as described above .
