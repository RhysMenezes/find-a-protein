soil fertilization is a common practice in modern agriculture undertaken to prevent nutrient deficiency in crops . however fertilization is costly and causes environmental pollution . the cultivation of plants that tolerate low nutrient supplies may circumvent this problem . here we report the generation of arabidopsis thaliana plants that tolerate boron deficient conditions due to the overexpression of _PROTEIN_ an efflux b transporter that is required for efficient xylem loading of b . in several independently generated transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus rna promoter root to shoot translocation of b was enhanced and shoot growth was greater under b limiting conditions compared with wild type plants . in addition the transgenic plants showed increased translocation of b especially to the shoot apex and set seed normally under b limiting conditions under which wild type plants failed to set seed . this study therefore reports plants that show improved seed yields compared with wild type under nutrient deficient conditions as a result of increased production of an essential mineral nutrient transporter .
before generating transgenic arabidopsis plants that overexpress either _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ we determined the b transport activity of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in yeast . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was _PROTEIN_ in yeast cells lacking the sole _PROTEIN_ ortholog in yeast and the b concentration in the cells after exposure to mm boric acid was determined . the b concentration in cells _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was similar to that in cells _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and about half that in cells carrying the control vector . these results indicate that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ is capable of reducing the b concentration in cells to an extent similar to _PROTEIN_ . the addition of _METHOD_ at the c terminus of _PROTEIN_ did not affect the b efflux transporter activity of the protein . we generated arabidopsis plants overexpressing _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus rna promoter . seven and homozygous independent transgenic lines containing the _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ constructs respectively were generated . among them one _PROTEIN_ line and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ lines exhibited reduced growth on media containing b especially in the aerial portion of the plants but not on media containing normal levels of b . the b deficiency specific growth defects are similar to the phenotype of the _PROTEIN_ mutant . all of the transgenic lines that exhibited this phenotype also showed _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mrna accumulation suggesting that the phenotype was caused by the suppression of _PROTEIN_ of both the endogenous _PROTEIN_ and the _PROTEIN_ transgene . among the other transgenic lines we identified four and that showed elevated accumulation of _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ mrna . the lines and carry pcamv _PROTEIN_ and the lines and carry pcamv _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . segregation of t dna in the generation indicated that each line carries the t dna insertion at a single locus . the lines that were homozygous for the t dna insertion were carried to the generation and used in subsequent studies . the _PROTEIN_ mrna accumulation was determined using real time rt pcr . the _PROTEIN_ transcript levels were standardized to the levels of the ubiquitin _PROTEIN_ transcript as a control . the relative mrna accumulation in the transgenic plants is shown after normalization to the level in wild type plants which was defined as one . the means sd of three replicates are shown . wt wild type col transgenic line carrying _PROTEIN_ transgenic line carrying _PROTEIN_ transgenic line carrying _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgenic line carrying _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . to examine the effect of _PROTEIN_ overexpression on plant growth in media containing various b concentrations the transgenic lines and were first grown on solid media containing or b . the growth of both lines was similar to that of the wild type when b was supplied at . in contrast the growth of the aerial portions of the transgenic plants was obviously more vigorous than that of the wild type plants on medium containing b . we then examined the growth of the transgenic line under a wide range of b concentrations from to . the shoot growth but not the root growth of the transgenic plants was significantly improved in media containing or b . the fresh weight of plants of the transgenic line was twice that of wild type plants . improved growth under b supply was also observed in the line . these results established that the growth improvement of transgenic plants under b limited conditions was caused by the overexpression of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . importantly the growth of both shoots and roots of the transgenic lines was indistinguishable from that of wild type plants when the plants were supplied with normal levels of b . in addition there was no significant difference in the growth of transgenic or wild type plants in the presence of toxic levels of b . the transgenic plants generated in the present study exhibited enhanced growth under low b conditions and no obvious detrimental effects under conditions with optimal or high levels of b . in crop plants the requirement for b is often higher in the reproductive stage than in the vegetative stage . during the reproductive stage b deficiency damages flower development fertilization and fruit growth . b deficiency _PROTEIN_ seed yields in wheat even in the absence of observable _METHOD_ in the vegetative growth . in arabidopsis similar growth defects were observed . when grown hydroponically in medium containing b wild type plants grew normally in the vegetative stages but failed to set seed . in contrast under the same conditions the transgenic plants overexpressing _PROTEIN_ set seed normally . this improvement in seed set was observed in all transgenic lines exhibiting elevated _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . therefore the overexpression of _PROTEIN_ improves seed set under b deficient conditions . to elucidate the physiological basis of the increased shoot growth caused by the overexpression of _PROTEIN_ we measured accumulation of b in shoots . the plants were grown for days under continuous supply of various concentrations of b . consistent with the results of previous reports the b concentration in shoots was lower in the _PROTEIN_ mutant plants than in wild type plants under low b conditions and similar under normal and high b conditions . in the _PROTEIN_ overexpressing transgenic plants the b concentrations in shoots were times greater than those in the wild type when grown in media containing and b . the b concentration was in a similar range in all lines in media containing b . these results indicate that the shoots of transgenic lines accumulate more b than those of the wild type under b limiting and optimal conditions but not under b toxic conditions . to elucidate the nature of the increased b accumulation in shoots caused by the overexpression of _PROTEIN_ a short term b uptake experiment into roots and shoots was conducted using stable isotopes of b . the plants were initially grown for days in a standard medium containing enriched b followed by growth for days in medium containing enriched b . the plants were then incubated for min in medium containing enriched b and the concentrations of the tracer in roots and shoots were determined . growth in low b medium prior to application of the tracer was previously shown to enhance _PROTEIN_ activity in wild type plants . similar to the results of previous reports the b uptake into shoots but not roots was lower in the _PROTEIN_ mutant plants than in wild type plants . in the _PROTEIN_ overexpressing transgenic plants the b uptake into roots was similar to or slightly lower than that in wild type plants . in contrast the amounts of b taken up into shoots in these transgenic lines were more than double that in the wild type . these results indicate that the translocation of b from roots to shoots but not the uptake of b into roots was increased in the transgenic lines . to further understand the basis of the improved seed set in the transgenic plants the distribution of the tracer b in different portions of shoots was examined by determining the b translocation into the rosette leaves and shoot apices . in the present study we define the shoot apex as the uppermost cm of the stem . forty day old plants grown in the presence of enriched b were treated with for h. the plants were then transferred into medium containing enriched boric acid as a tracer and incubated for another h. after this treatment fully expanded rosette leaves and shoot apices were harvested and the concentrations of and were determined . in agreement with the results of the short term uptake experiments into the shoot the tracer b concentrations in both the rosette leaves and the shoot apices were lower in _PROTEIN_ mutant plants and higher in the transgenic plants than in wild type plants . in addition the distributions of b between the rosette leaves and the shoot apices were altered in the _PROTEIN_ mutant and the transgenic plants . in the _PROTEIN_ mutant the tracer b concentrations in the rosette leaves and the shoot apices were and respectively of those in the same organs in wild type plants . this reduction is consistent with the results of previous reports and represents the contribution of endogenous _PROTEIN_ to the translocation of b preferentially to the shoot apex rather than to the rosette leaves . in the transgenic lines overexpressing _PROTEIN_ the tracer b concentrations were times higher in rosette leaves and times higher in shoot apices when compared with those in the wild type plants . these results demonstrate that overexpression of _PROTEIN_ enhances the preferential translocation of b to shoot apices . it is likely that this enhanced transport contributes to the improved seed set of the transgenic plants under conditions of limited b supply . the camv rna promoter is a constitutive promoter that is strongly _PROTEIN_ in vascular tissues . to examine the tissue types in which _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was _PROTEIN_ the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was observed in the transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . strong _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was observed in the periphery of all root cell types in plants grown in low b conditions as reported previously . in the root tip _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was detected strongly in the meristematic region . more importantly in the mature portion _METHOD_ was detected predominately in vascular tissues . it is likely that high accumulation of _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ of cells surrounding the xylem vessels caused the export of b from the symplasts to the stelar apoplasts resulting in increased translocation of b from the roots to the shoots via the xylem under b limiting conditions .
