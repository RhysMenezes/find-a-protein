_LOCATION_ dna is a circular molecule of kbp which is organized into a protein dna complex called a nucleoid . although various _LOCATION_ other than chloroplasts exist such as etioplasts amyloplasts and chromoplasts it is not easy to observe _LOCATION_ nucleoids within the cells of many non green tissues . the pend _LOCATION_ protein is a dna binding protein in the inner envelope _LOCATION_ of developing chloroplasts and a dna binding domain called cbzip is present at its n terminus . we made various pend green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ fusion proteins using the cbzip domains from various plants and found that they were localized in the chloroplast nucleoids in transient _PROTEIN_ in leaf protoplasts . in stable transformants of arabidopsis thaliana pend _METHOD_ fusion proteins were also localized in the nucleoids of various _LOCATION_ . we have succeeded in visualizing _LOCATION_ nucleoids in various intact tissues using this stable transformant . this technique is useful in root flower and pollen in which it had been difficult to observe _LOCATION_ nucleoids . the relative arrangement of nucleoids within a chloroplast was kept unchanged when the chloroplast moved within a cell . during the division of _LOCATION_ nucleoids formed a network structure which made possible equal partition of nucleoids .
in our laboratory various efforts have been made to analyze the _LOCATION_ targeting sequence of the pend protein . the results indicate that the n terminal part downstream of the cbzip domain is sufficient for the targeting to chloroplasts . we therefore used dna constructs that _PROTEIN_ fusion proteins consisting of such an n terminus of pend proteins and _METHOD_ under the control of the promoter . the n terminal sequences of pend homologs of pea b. napus and a. thaliana were tested . fig . and d shows the results of such test experiments . in a transient _PROTEIN_ experiment the b. napus pend _METHOD_ fusion protein was targeted to the chloroplast and localized in particulate structures . the counterstaining with dapi coincided with the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ suggesting that the pend _METHOD_ was localized to the nucleoids within the chloroplasts . in this particular micrograph two protoplasts are shown but one of the protoplasts was not transformed which served as a negative control confirming that the dapi _METHOD_ was not seen with the _METHOD_ filter . the localization of pend _METHOD_ to the nucleoids but not to the envelope _LOCATION_ is explained by the _PROTEIN_ that the c terminal transmembrane domain of pend protein was not included in this n terminal construct . then stable transformants of a. thaliana _PROTEIN_ a. thaliana pend _METHOD_ fusion protein or pea pend _METHOD_ fusion protein were constructed . the lines that _PROTEIN_ homologous pend _METHOD_ as well as that _PROTEIN_ pea pend _METHOD_ were healthy and comparison with wild type lines indicated no significant difference with respect to morphology of seedling and root growth and leaf color . the micrograph shows a part of a root hair cell of the line indicating that the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was not localized to mitochondria which is visualized by _METHOD_ of mitotracker . all these results suggest that the pend _METHOD_ fusion protein is principally localized to the _LOCATION_ nucleoids in stable transformants . we sometimes observed _METHOD_ in the cell _LOCATION_ of protoplasts in transient _PROTEIN_ but the _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ was negligible in stable transformants _LOCATION_ . immunoblot analysis was performed to confirm chloroplast localization of the pend _METHOD_ fusion protein . proteins from total leaves or isolated chloroplasts of stably transformed a. thaliana seedlings were probed with either anti pend or anti _METHOD_ antisera . in a kda band was clearly found as a _PROTEIN_ immunoreactive band . a less intense band was found in . semi quantitative measurement of the abundance of pend _METHOD_ with respect to the large subunit of rubisco suggested that the level of pend _METHOD_ was times higher in than in . the _PROTEIN_ that the relative abundance value was similar in whole leaves and isolated chloroplasts confirmed that pend _METHOD_ was _PROTEIN_ localized in chloroplasts . the difference in _PROTEIN_ level is also evident in _METHOD_ image of whole seedlings . in the roots were highly _METHOD_ while the _METHOD_ of leaves was variable depending on regions . in _METHOD_ was much weaker . endogenous pend protein was hardly detectable in the immunoblots and must be much less abundant than pend _METHOD_ . a small amount of free _METHOD_ was detected but the free _METHOD_ did not interfere with observation of _LOCATION_ nucleoids as shown below probably because the signal of such free _METHOD_ is diffuse and distributed over the entire cytoplasm . the band at about kda originated from non specific reaction due to the rubisco large subunit . the _METHOD_ localization to nucleoids was also confirmed in isolated chloroplasts . first we observed _LOCATION_ nucleoids in various cells of cotyledons and leaves of a. thaliana transformants . in the parenchymal cells of cotyledons of a dark grown seedling a single spherical nucleoid was found in each _LOCATION_ . depending on _LOCATION_ the _METHOD_ looked circular which might reflect association of nucleoids with the envelope _LOCATION_ as in dark grown pea leaves . in cotyledons of light grown seedlings _LOCATION_ were not clearly visible in the nomarski image due to many protein bodies but the _METHOD_ of pend _METHOD_ was useful in identifying _LOCATION_ . the _METHOD_ was associated with elongated structures . however it is not clear if the _LOCATION_ nucleoids are elongated or this reflects the elongated shape of _LOCATION_ in which nucleoids are attached to the envelope _LOCATION_ . in guard cells of a cotyledon developed chloroplasts are clearly visible and the nucleoids were found as small patches within the chloroplasts . these chloroplasts were similar to the chloroplasts of mesophyll . the multi particulate nucleoids were also seen in pea mature leaves . in petiole parenchyma chloroplasts were small and filled with starch granules . two or three nucleoids were seen within each chloroplast . nucleoids were not clearly distributed in the periphery of chloroplasts . the nucleoids were also clearly visible in _LOCATION_ of non green tissues . in the seed coat nucleoids became visible as early as h after the start of imbibition of a seed . each _LOCATION_ contained a single particulate nucleoid as well as a large starch granule . at a _PROTEIN_ time nucleoids were still seen as particulate structures . in these figures reflection or refraction of _METHOD_ was found as faint background due to _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ structures of seed coat that interfered with clear observation . _PROTEIN_ is another example of an organ in which the dynamics of _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ nucleoids remained obscure . fig . shows that the _METHOD_ was found in most cells including vascular bundles . an enlargement shows that a number of small spherical _LOCATION_ were present in the peripheral cytoplasm and that two or three nucleoids were present in each _LOCATION_ . in stamens a number of _LOCATION_ nucleoids were visualized . however in pollen nucleoids were found only rarely . an enlargement shows such a rare observation of _LOCATION_ nucleoid within a pollen grain . this is consistent with the previous finding that the _LOCATION_ dna is degraded during the formation of pollen . in the root it has been difficult to discriminate _LOCATION_ from mitochondria but the pend _METHOD_ _METHOD_ clearly visualized _LOCATION_ nucleoids in vivo as shown in fig . . fig . is a wider view showing some whole root hairs . root hairs were indeed ideal material to visualize _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ nucleoids because they are single elongated cells and the cytoplasm is not filled with particulate structures or organelles . _LOCATION_ nucleoids were seen as small particulate structures . the _METHOD_ was stronger in the region near the root meristem possibly reflecting the promoter activity of the promoter in rapidly dividing cells _METHOD_ . alternatively the amount of _LOCATION_ dna might be slightly higher near the root meristem as shown by fujie et al . . an enlargement shows that each _LOCATION_ contained a large starch granule and a single large nucleoid . this could be an aggregate of smaller nucleoid particles as shown by dapi staining of thin sections . the resolution is in effect lower in the present study because a whole root is examined alive . however the difference of fluorochromes _METHOD_ could also account for the difference in observed images in the two studies . in the cells located at the base of a root cap large amyloplasts filled with starch contained a few nucleoids . we next recorded motion of _LOCATION_ nucleoids within _LOCATION_ in various tissues as a digital movie . the imaging system that we used was effective enough to record motion of _LOCATION_ for min at a rate of one shot per s. the chloroplasts were moving around within the mesophyll cell driven by the cytoplasmic streaming and were also rotating . in this figure the motion of a single chloroplast was followed . this chloroplast contained six particulate nucleoids . it moved within the cell according to the cytoplasmic streaming but the relative arrangement of the nucleoids within the chloroplast was unchanged during this time span . this and other observations suggest that nucleoids do not move freely within the chloroplast . they might bind to either the envelope _LOCATION_ as shown previously or the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ as shown recently . another observation showed that numerous _LOCATION_ were associated with the cell _LOCATION_ in a trichome and were rapidly changing their position around the _LOCATION_ . a single nucleoid was found in each _LOCATION_ . this dancing was very rapid and the position orientation and morphology of _LOCATION_ were incessantly changing but the morphology of the nucleoid did not change during the _LOCATION_ movement . it is not clear whether such rapid movement is caused by cytoplasmic streaming or some specific interaction with _LOCATION_ surrounding the _LOCATION_ . such motion might be important in nucleo _LOCATION_ interaction but it is difficult to find its physiological significance at present . we found rapid motion of _LOCATION_ having a clearly condensed nucleoid within several long cells of the vascular bundle . _LOCATION_ moved along such elongated cells at a rate of s while the _LOCATION_ in the neighboring cells showed brownian motion . the rapid motion is apparently driven by cytoplasmic streaming . in the observation in fig . _LOCATION_ marked with and moved from the right to the left but reverse motion was also found in another cell of the identical vascular bundle . the elongated cells are associated with the vascular bundle but we do not have conclusive identification of the cells . although this is a study on the nucleoids we describe this observation here because there is no description of such movement of _LOCATION_ within such elongated cells . one of the _PROTEIN_ objectives of visualization of nucleoids is to follow the process of nucleoid partition during the division of the chloroplast . fig . shows images demonstrating dividing chloroplasts in young cotyledons in the transformant lines and . we used different lines _PROTEIN_ fusion proteins containing pend sequences from different species . the a. thaliana sequence was _PROTEIN_ at a higher level than the pea sequence as shown in fig . and comparison of these lines _PROTEIN_ different levels of pend _METHOD_ made us evaluate possible adverse effects such as inhibition of _LOCATION_ division caused by the overexpression of such a dna binding protein within the chloroplast . note that the contrast of the image in fig . was enhanced digitally because the original _METHOD_ in was very weak . however no significant adverse effect of high level _PROTEIN_ of pend _METHOD_ driven by the promoter was detected in . we were able to record only static images showing the division of _LOCATION_ in the present study . however it is clear that the nucleoids became filamentous and formed a network at the early stage of division . the network of nucleoids was split with one or two strands that connect the separating networks . before the division was complete the two clusters of nucleoid network were separated . apparently there were no nucleoids in the constriction region at this final stage of division . as a way of comparing dividing and non dividing _LOCATION_ the images of _LOCATION_ within the cell shown in fig . were picked up and arranged according to the progress of _LOCATION_ division . another series of images taken from a separate experiment is also shown in fig . . the large _LOCATION_ is supposed to represent the _LOCATION_ before division and the pairs of small _LOCATION_ placed side by side are supposed to represent _LOCATION_ just after division . the nucleoids are present as distinct particles before and after the division although the nucleoids are more or less elongated . throughout the division process the nucleoids or nucleoid network were present in the periphery of the chloroplast which is consistent with the previous observation that the _LOCATION_ nucleoids are attached to the envelope _LOCATION_ in rapidly replicating chloroplasts .
