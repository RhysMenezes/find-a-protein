the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ serves as the point of contact between cells and the outside environment . as such changes in the pm proteome are an important component of understanding cellular responses to a diverse array of stimuli . however intricate sample handling to enrich pm proteomes by traditional methods is both technically _PROTEIN_ and time consuming . here we describe a simplified method for _PROTEIN_ the representation of other _LOCATION_ organelles such as the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and mitochondria from crude microsomal _LOCATION_ isolations . the _PROTEIN_ in other organellar proteomes results in an increase in both the total number of pm proteins and the number of spectra identified from these proteins representing the pm proteome . therefore this strategy represents a simple and rapid method for enriching pm proteins from arabidopsis cell cultures for proteomic analyses .
in addition to pm proteins crude microsomal preparations also contain other organellar constituents such as those from the _LOCATION_ mitochondria and chloroplasts . we questioned whether the heterogeneity of the sample reflected similar densities of vesicles during ultracentrifugation or if these organelles may become trapped in the pm vesicles during cellular disruption . if the latter was true we reasoned that the detergent which inverts pm vesicles citation might release the contaminating structures producing a simplified method for analyzing enriched pm proteomes . to explore if treatment of crude microsomal _LOCATION_ may assist in increasing the representation of pm proteins we performed a comparative experiment using the strategy outlined in fig . . after disrupting cells by freezing in liquid nitrogen and grinding with a mortar and pestle the homogenate was by centrifugation at followed by ultracentrifugation of the supernatant at to collect the cm pellet . a portion of this cm was resuspended in homogenization buffer containing to invert _LOCATION_ vesicles . after ultracentrifugation to the _LOCATION_ sodium _PROTEIN_ was used to wash loosely bound _LOCATION_ proteins followed by another round of ultracentrifugation . the resulting pellet is hereafter referred to as the pm pellet . as an initial test of this strategy for enriching pm proteins we performed immunoblot analyses using equal amounts of protein from the soluble fraction of first ultracentrifugation the cm fraction and the pm fraction . the _PROTEIN_ integral pm h were strongly enriched in the pm as compared to the cm or _LOCATION_ fractions . conversely an integral _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ protein was strongly enriched in the cm fraction but depleted in the pm fraction . _PROTEIN_ a mitochondrial inner _LOCATION_ protein was present in all three fractions but with higher levels in the cm than the pm fraction . these results demonstrated that at least for the markers used the pm isolation enriched for pm proteins over _LOCATION_ or mitochondrial proteins . to further test the enrichment effect of pm fraction we used digital immunoblotting _METHOD_ to look at a wider range of protein markers . equivalent amounts of protein from pm or cm fractions were separated by _PROTEIN_ . each lane was cut into eight slices and peptides were recovered following digestion . proteins were considered identified based on protein identification confidence with confidence level for the minimum of two peptides . as an initial analysis of whether the _METHOD_ data supported the immunoblot data for pm enrichment we found that the unweighted spectral counts for the pm marker _PROTEIN_ showed clear enrichment in the pm fraction confirming the immunoblot results and supporting the validity of using spectral counting for these comparisons . similarly a number of other pm proteins such as the abc transporter _PROTEIN_ citation were enriched in the pm over the cm fractions . conversely _LOCATION_ marker proteins such as bip and calnexin were substantially depleted in the pm versus the cm fractions . as these initial results clearly demonstrated the ability of this fractionation strategy to enrich for pm over _LOCATION_ proteins we next initiated a broader analysis to determine the compartmental representation of proteins in these fractions . for many proteins assigning a definitive cellular compartment is a difficult task because of the limitations in accurate predictions and lack of experimental evidence for large portions of the predicted plant proteome . moreover many proteins may actually reside in multiple cellular compartments . as a simplified strategy for assigning predicted protein locations we used assignments based on _PROTEIN_ predictions . we selected _PROTEIN_ because it houses ten algorithmic predictors and five experimental predictors in one integrated system specifically built for the arabidopsis genome citation . for comparisons of organellar representation in each fraction in this study we considered only proteins for which the total number of predicted locations exceeded any other predicted locations . as a point of reference we used these criteria to examine the predicted proteome . using these parameters _PROTEIN_ assigned exclusive locations to of the predicted proteins . therefore these criteria are somewhat restrictive as only of the possible proteome can be assigned . however this strategy eliminates user bias that can occur during manual assignment of location . three independent biological isolations were prepared as described for the initial analysis and analyzed by _METHOD_ . in each of the three experiments over of the proteins were identified in both cm and pm fractions with the remaining identified proteins being split between the two methods . the differences in total numbers of proteins identified in each biological replica were _PROTEIN_ due to different sample loadings of protein which ranged from to . the number of proteins identified by each fractionation strategy within a biological replica was equivalent indicating equal protein sampling . as an initial analysis we qualitatively examined the fractionation methods to determine the number pm versus _LOCATION_ proteins identified by each method . as shown in fig . the average number of pm proteins found in pm fraction is higher than that in the cm fraction . conversely the average number of _LOCATION_ proteins found in pm pellet is of that in cm pellet . therefore enriching for the pm fraction identified more pm proteins while depleting _LOCATION_ proteins as compared to the cm fraction . in _PROTEIN_ to the total numbers of proteins listed in fig . it should be noted that based on our criteria for assigning location only proteins from the entire arabidopsis predicted proteome would be classified as present exclusively at the pm . therefore the number of pm proteins identified in the pm fraction of biological experiment for instance actually represents of all possible pm proteins predicted by these criteria . we interpret these results as a demonstration that the enrichment process for pm proteins is effective but the absolute numbers as listed are likely an underestimation of the real number of pm and/or _LOCATION_ proteins in each fraction because of the limitations of using the _PROTEIN_ criteria as the sole predictor . the overlap of proteins found in each biological experiment is shown in the venn diagram . there was > overlap in pm proteins from all three biological isolations . overlap between experiments and unique identifications associated largely with the total number of proteins identified in the particular experiment . qualitatively we also examined these fractions for the presence of proteins predicted to be in other organelles . based on the average of all three experiments we found that the pm fraction enriched for proteins predicted to be localized in the cytoplasm and ex space while _PROTEIN_ the number of proteins from _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ mi and _LOCATION_ . proteins from the _LOCATION_ were distributed relatively evenly between the two fractions . the enrichment of cy and ex proteins may reflect the presence of proteins tightly associated pm in which case these proteins could be considered as an extension of the pm proteome . the qualitative analysis revealed that a greater number of pm proteins were identified in the pm fraction . in addition initial comparative experiments indicated that even if the same protein was identified in both fractions the protein was more abundant in the pm than in the cm fraction . to determine if this observation was applicable for a larger population of proteins we quantitatively compared the abundance of proteins assigned to specific compartments in table using spectral counting . to measure the enrichment profile of proteins in the pm fraction versus the cm fraction we performed comparisons of spectral counts within each biological replica using _PROTEIN_ ratio as quantitative measurement . for these comparisons proteins not identified in an experiment were assigned to allow inclusion in the calculations . for each compartment the calculated mean values of _PROTEIN_ from all three experiments are shown in fig . . the quantitation showed more than a increase of pm proteins in the pm fractions than in the cm fraction . conversely _LOCATION_ proteins were _PROTEIN_ by more than sixfold in the pm fraction . in general the quantitative differences for other organellar compartments reflected the same patterns as seen for the qualitative comparisons . however particularly for the organelles depleted in the pm fraction the quantitative results showed the effectiveness of the fractionation more clearly . for instance whereas the qualitative comparison showed a slight depletion of mi in the pm fraction the quantitative comparison showed a twofold depletion . moreover even though _LOCATION_ proteins were qualitatively identified to an equal extent in both fractions the abundance of _LOCATION_ proteins actually was significantly less in the pm fraction . therefore the quantitative analysis further supports the ability of the simple technique to increase the representation of pm and possibly proteins over proteins from other organelles . in previous experiments citation citation we analyzed pm phosphoproteomes by digesting peptides directly off the enriched pm vesicles . we were interested as to whether the present strategy could be used similarly to avoid a gel separation step . however when we performed a trial analysis of digested peptides we did not observe the same enrichment of pm proteins as the majority of proteins identified were ribosomal proteins . significant differences between the results from versus strategies were immediately obvious when plotting the total number of unique peptide spectra versus the molecular weight range of identified protein by each strategy . the strategy was biased toward lower molecular weight proteins which largely included the ribosomal proteins whereas the strategy showed a greater representation of proteins with mw > kda _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . these results indicated that even in the sample the additional abundant proteins took up a large portion of the data acquisition time during _METHOD_ thereby interfering with the identification of pm proteins . thus the separation of proteins prior to sequencing is an important part of this procedure as it removes the bias these highly abundant low mw proteins from other organelles cause in the _METHOD_ analysis . in general the size selection of higher mw proteins actually appears to be advantageous when the goal is enriching for pm proteins . in analysis of the mw distribution of proteins from the major organellar compartments of interest in this study namely the pm _LOCATION_ pl and mi we noticed that the pm proteome is biased toward proteins of higher mw whereas the other organellar compartments that we set out to deplete are biased toward lower mw proteins . clearly the and _PROTEIN_ treatments also increase representation of pm proteins as the pm and cm fractions were gel separated in this study but this simple analysis also indicates that running _PROTEIN_ gels a bit longer to only digest and sequence proteins > kda appears to be preferential for enriching for pm proteins as well .
