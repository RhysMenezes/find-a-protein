calcium is vital for plant growth development hormone response and _PROTEIN_ to environmental stresses yet the _METHOD_ regulating plant _LOCATION_ homeostasis are not fully understood . here we characterize an arabidopsis na exchanger _PROTEIN_ that regulates and multiple physiological processes . _PROTEIN_ was localized to the tonoplast in yeast and plant cells . _PROTEIN_ appeared to mediate sodium _LOCATION_ sequestration and meanwhile release . the domains within _PROTEIN_ regulated binding and transport of and na . plants with diminished _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were more tolerant to high but more sensitive to both nacl and auxin heightened _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ rendered plants more sensitive to but tolerant to nacl . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ appeared to be regulated by the diurnal rhythm and suppressed by auxin . gus _PROTEIN_ and root responses to auxin were altered in _PROTEIN_ mutants . the suppression of _PROTEIN_ was attenuated in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants . the mutants with altered _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ also altered flowering time and _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ may mediate _PROTEIN_ flowering time change . therefore _PROTEIN_ is a _LOCATION_ na exchanger that regulates auxin responses and flowering time .
_PROTEIN_ shared high identity and similarity with several unknown proteins . sequence alignment suggests that _PROTEIN_ shows similarity with cax proteins in the c terminus . _PROTEIN_ has predicted tmds separated by a hydrophilic region containing two predicted motifs into the n terminus and c terminus . the overall topology and the presence of two ef hands are similar to ncxs . yeast mutants have been a powerful tool to functionally characterize plant and animal transporters . because _PROTEIN_ is a predicted /na exchanger we _PROTEIN_ it in yeast strains with defects in and na transport to test its function . firstly _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ in a yeast mutant strain that is defective in _LOCATION_ sequestration owing to the deletions of _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ /h exchanger . despite some homology with caxs _PROTEIN_ could not suppress the phenotype of these yeast strains . furthermore _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ caused these strains to be more sensitive to . specifically when cells harbouring an empty vector grew well on mm and the first dilution even grew at mm _PROTEIN_ yeast cells grew poorly on plates containing mm and failed to grow on media containing mm . yeast cells _PROTEIN_ an truncated _PROTEIN_ showed strong growth under all conditions tested . we thus tested _PROTEIN_ using another strain defective in _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ transporters . again _PROTEIN_ also could not suppress the strain 's sensitivity to mm ethylene glycol tetraacetic acid . while strongly suppresses the sensitivity phenotype of yeast cells defective in _LOCATION_ transport but shows hypersensitivity to nacl _PROTEIN_ cells showed the opposite growth phenotypes . _PROTEIN_ partly suppressed the phenotypes when _PROTEIN_ in a yeast strain which is defective in a _LOCATION_ na /h antiporter _PROTEIN_ and which is a triple mutant defective in both _PROTEIN_ and the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ na /k efflux transporters and _PROTEIN_ while _PROTEIN_ the arabidopsis na /h antiporter _PROTEIN_ strongly suppressed this growth sensitivity . _PROTEIN_ shares similarity at the c terminus with caxs however the yeast growth phenotypes are different . to further compare their activities _PROTEIN_ was with in yeast cells defective in sequestration . the phenotype generated by was partially reversed by _PROTEIN_ while the phenotype of was partially avoided when the cells were with _PROTEIN_ . because antibodies against _PROTEIN_ are not available we made _PROTEIN_ fusions to the n terminus of _METHOD_ and to the c terminus of the triple epitope ha . yeast mutant cells _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or _PROTEIN_ showed similar phenotypes . the localization of in yeast cells was first determined by the of this protein with _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ in _LOCATION_ fractionations . the sedimentation behaviour of the _LOCATION_ fraction containing is consistent with that of a _LOCATION_ compartment but not like the _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ . furthermore _METHOD_ was localized to the yeast endomembrane system whereas free _METHOD_ cells showed signals throughout the cells . _METHOD_ was localized on the tonoplast when _PROTEIN_ in the stably transformed arabidopsis leaf epidermal cells and transiently in onion epidermal cells . the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ localization of _METHOD_ in highly _LOCATION_ tobacco epidermal cells is clearly different from that of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ which was marked by labelling . many small provacuoles and inner structures were observed too indicating that _METHOD_ is a highly dynamic transporter trafficking with _LOCATION_ vesicles . to further verify this the _LOCATION_ fractionation and western blotting were carried out with plant leaves _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . similar to the results obtained from the yeast _METHOD_ is with _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ fractions as marked with rather than with _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and the _LOCATION_ that are marked by and bip respectively . the motif is a helix loop helix structure that binds . two conserved motifs appear in the _LOCATION_ loop of _PROTEIN_ . to establish binding activity in this region the motifs of _PROTEIN_ were _PROTEIN_ as a _PROTEIN_ fusion and binding assays were performed . as shown in fig . bacteria _PROTEIN_ the fusion of kda were purified with agarose affinity resin column . a overlay assay with the purified _PROTEIN_ fusion free _PROTEIN_ and cam demonstrated binding to both cam and the fusion protein . this suggests that _PROTEIN_ ef hands have a role in binding . binding domains in many transporters such as mammal ncx and yeast play important roles in regulation of transporter activity and vectorial transport . we then tested whether the ef hands in _PROTEIN_ act as a _LOCATION_ sensor and regulate ncx activity . to address this a truncated version of _PROTEIN_ deleting the ef hands _PROTEIN_ was constructed and _PROTEIN_ in yeast cells . when _PROTEIN_ in yeast cells defective in _LOCATION_ transport _PROTEIN_ cells became more sensitive to than _PROTEIN_ cells . at the same time the cells were more resistant to nacl stress than _PROTEIN_ . the increased na tolerance by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was further confirmed in the na yeast strains and defective in _LOCATION_ na /h transporter _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ of the truncated protein was examined by using western blotting which shows _PROTEIN_ with expected size . to explain the ca sensitivity phenotype conferred by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in strain a more sensitive assay in liquid medium containing nacl and was conducted . in medium containing mm the growth rates of yeast cells _PROTEIN_ vector control declined rapidly in the presence of high concentrations of nacl . however the growth of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ cells were not severely inhibited . the differences between cells _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and empty vector became more evident when high concentrations of nacl were applied . however in growth media containing mm nacl the growth rates of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ cells were reduced more dramatically than the vector control with increasing concentrations of applied directly measuring the na exchange activity of the tonoplast _PROTEIN_ is a technically difficult because there is no electric current generated by the na exchange mechanism . to determine if yeast phenotypes were due to na imbalances caused by _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ ions in these yeast cells were analysed by means of _METHOD_ . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ cells accumulated much more nacl than cells _PROTEIN_ the empty vector alone . to reach an accurate measurement of ncx activity through minimizing the effects of _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ /h antiporter was used for providing na for uptake substrate and acting as an inhibitor of to prevent released by _PROTEIN_ from being taken up back into the _LOCATION_ . furthermore _LOCATION_ vesicles isolated from _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ cells did sequester more na than vesicles harbouring just the vector . _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ na accumulation reached a maximum at min and _LOCATION_ from _PROTEIN_ cells accumulated more na than those from _PROTEIN_ cells . as application of triton destroyed the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ integrity and resulted in na leakiness na uptake value _PROTEIN_ correspondingly indicating that na uptake was not due to binding . meanwhile ca levels in the vesicles dropped faster in _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ ones than in vector control indicating that uptake of na was coincident with the release of in _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ vesicles in a na exchange manner . to test the coupled transport of na and a ionophore was included in the assay to abolish the gradients in the _LOCATION_ to examine the effect on na uptake . as expected na uptake was also abolished . on the contrary of yeast _LOCATION_ with higher concentration enhanced na uptake . these data further support that _PROTEIN_ functions on the tonoplast transport na in exchange of . yeast cells _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ accumulated more when grown in ypd medium supplemented with mm . to further clarify transport kinetics uptake in yeast cells defective in _LOCATION_ transport was conducted . feeding yeast cells with _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ cells showed significantly increased uptake compared with control in the short term . moreover a protracted assay of uptake by _PROTEIN_ cells demonstrated a saturable curve whereas those of both and _PROTEIN_ cells did not . analysis of _PROTEIN_ promoter reporter lines shows that _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ throughout the plant tissues during the entire life cycle . furthermore _PROTEIN_ is strongly _PROTEIN_ in leaf and shoot tissue and in the apical meristem of young plants . this high level and ubiquitous _PROTEIN_ was confirmed by northern blotting . leaves roots _METHOD_ flowers and siliques all appeared to _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . northern blotting analysis with seedlings showed that _PROTEIN_ was induced by mannitol and nacl . both mm nacl and mm mannitol induced _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in a manner . these data are consistent with publically available microarray data . to gain more insights into the function of _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis two homozygous insertion knockout lines for _PROTEIN_ were obtained by screening salk insertion lines . northern blotting showed that _PROTEIN_ transcript levels in two homozygous mutant alleles were absent . in addition transgenic lines _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ driven by a promoter were generated and multiple homozygous _PROTEIN_ lines were obtained . root elongation assays with these lines showed that both null and overexpression mutants grew similarly with seedlings on _METHOD_ plates the na and measurement data showed no statistic difference . however _PROTEIN_ mutant _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ seedlings grew much better on and mm plates than wild type did most _PROTEIN_ lines were more sensitive to . these growth phenotypes of the transgenic lines contrast with the mutants . at the same time _PROTEIN_ mutant seedlings are more sensitive to nacl stress than controls the _PROTEIN_ lines were resistant to nacl stress . ion analysis on these knockouts under and nacl stress conditions indicated that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants accumulate more na and less . because homeostasis and signalling connect to many hormone and growth and development phenotypes and _PROTEIN_ mutants showed altered response to auxin we screened these mutants for growth development and hormone response phenotype and observed a clearly increased number of _PROTEIN_ root and root elongation in _PROTEIN_ knockout mutants compared with wild type in response to both iaa and naa treatments . meanwhile _PROTEIN_ lines were less sensitive to _PROTEIN_ root formation and root elongation . relative _PROTEIN_ levels of _PROTEIN_ were _PROTEIN_ over time by nm iaa or naa auxin treatment suggesting that _PROTEIN_ is subject to regulation by auxin . gus _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ was more sensitive to auxin than that in wild type but gus in _PROTEIN_ lines showed the least induction by auxin relative to those in and _PROTEIN_ knockout mutant backgrounds . we observed that _PROTEIN_ mutant plants flowered at approximately the same time as plants under sd conditions . however under _PROTEIN_ conditions _PROTEIN_ lines flowered significantly _PROTEIN_ than did the control plants whereas both _PROTEIN_ mutant lines flowered earlier than as indicated by days to flowering and the number of rosette leaves at flowering . furthermore overexpression of _PROTEIN_ in resulted in more severe delay in flowering however the flowering time of a _PROTEIN_ double mutant was between those of and _PROTEIN_ . these data suggest that _PROTEIN_ may mediate the _PROTEIN_ flowering time change . because _PROTEIN_ is regulated by light signals we examined _PROTEIN_ and found that it also shows diurnal rhythm with higher _PROTEIN_ in the night and lower _PROTEIN_ in the daytime . examining the _PROTEIN_ of genes related to flowering time showed that _PROTEIN_ mutants have an altered _PROTEIN_ of two major flowering genes _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and flowering locus t _PROTEIN_ but not _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ levels were increased but _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ lines relative to wild type under _PROTEIN_ conditions . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was higher in flowering mutant and auxin signalling mutants _PROTEIN_ and slr . _PROTEIN_ suppression was more effective in and but less effective in _PROTEIN_ and slr .
