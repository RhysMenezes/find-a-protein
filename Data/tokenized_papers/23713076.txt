transient and stable _PROTEIN_ of transgenes is central to many investigations in plant biology research . chemical regulation of _PROTEIN_ can circumvent _METHOD_ of plant lethality caused by constitutive overexpression or allow inducible knock approaches . several chemically inducible or repressible _METHOD_ have been described and successfully applied . however cloning and application specific modification of most available inducible _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ have been limited and remained complicated due to restricted cloning options . here we describe a new set of vectors that enable transgene _PROTEIN_ in transiently or stably transformed cells . all vectors harbor a synthetically optimized xve _PROTEIN_ cassette allowing estradiol mediated protein _PROTEIN_ . plasmids are equipped with the reporter genes gus _METHOD_ mcherry or with ha and strepii epitope tags and harbor an optimized multiple cloning site for flexible and simple cloning strategies . moreover the vector design allows simple substitution of the driving promoter to achieve tissue specificity or to modulate _PROTEIN_ ranges of inducible transgene _PROTEIN_ . we report details of the kinetics and dose dependence of _PROTEIN_ induction in arabidopsis leaf mesophyll protoplasts transiently transformed nicotiana benthamiana leaves and stably transformed arabidopsis plants . using these vectors we investigated the influence of _PROTEIN_ protein _PROTEIN_ on the subcellular localization of cipks . these analyses uncovered that induced co _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ is fully sufficient for dynamic translocation of _PROTEIN_ from the cytoplasm to the tonoplast . thus the vector system presented here facilitates a broad range of research applications .
to develop a user friendly chemically inducible vector system for transient and stable plant transformation we first attempted to optimize the existing estradiol responsive regulatory elements of the plasmid . to this end the reading frame of the xve fusion protein and the utr/terminator pea rbcs region of the original vector were redesigned and in vitro synthesized . the original xve reading frame contained restriction sites which are generally used for cloning strategies to insert genes of interest into mcss while the optimized sequence now contains only two nde i sites . moreover the codon usage of these sequences was optimized for _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis . in addition new restriction sites were included to allow simple replacement of the promoter terminator and the reading frame between promoter and terminator if required . consequently in the newly designed synthetic xve sequence nucleotides were replaced resulting in an overall similarity between the original and synthetic reading frames . to optimize the original constitutive _PROTEIN_ driver promoter which controls the _PROTEIN_ of the xve protein in the plasmid this promoter was also newly synthesized . here only nucleotides were replaced to remove three bam hi sites two hin diii sites as well as single eco rv hpa i sph i and xba i sites . unfortunately our _PROTEIN_ studies revealed that these changes resulted in a less active promoter that exhibited only of the _PROTEIN_ level of the original _PROTEIN_ driver promoter in transient in planta _PROTEIN_ studies . consequently in our further studies the _PROTEIN_ promoter was substituted by two alternative constitutive promoters . as the first constitutive promoter we chose a bp region of the at _PROTEIN_ gene promoter _PROTEIN_ from arabidopsis . publicly available _PROTEIN_ data indicated strong and constitutive _PROTEIN_ in all tissues and it has been successfully used for constitutive _PROTEIN_ of a gus reporter gene . in this promoter we exchanged one nucleotide to remove an internal sac i restriction site resulting in a promoter designated as . as a driving promoter for particularly strong inducible _PROTEIN_ especially in roots we chose the _PROTEIN_ promoter . again we manipulated this nucleotide sequence to avoid internal bam hi sites resulting in a promoter designated as _PROTEIN_ promoter . the _PROTEIN_ cassettes encompassing the complete coding regions of the driving promoters to the minimal promoter were cloned into pgptvii _METHOD_ c bar pgptvii _METHOD_ c kan and pgptvii _METHOD_ c hyg plasmids respectively . this gave rise to plant transformation vectors that combined the complete estradiol inducible _PROTEIN_ elements with an mcs upstream of a _METHOD_ reading frame and a nos terminator for _PROTEIN_ of c terminally _METHOD_ tagged fusion proteins . these plasmids were designated as sxve _METHOD_ c bar sxve _METHOD_ c kan sxve _METHOD_ c hyg _PROTEIN_ sxve _METHOD_ c bar _PROTEIN_ sxve _METHOD_ c kan and _PROTEIN_ sxve _METHOD_ c hyg . to allow cloning of n terminally tagged proteins we generated sxve _METHOD_ n bar sxve _METHOD_ n kan sxve _METHOD_ n hyg _PROTEIN_ sxve _METHOD_ n bar _PROTEIN_ sxve _METHOD_ n kan and _PROTEIN_ sxve _METHOD_ n hyg . this set of plasmids provides the choice for plant selection by basta kanamycin or hygromycin resistance respectively . the same strategy was used for generating plasmids containing mcherry c or n terminal of the mcs or gus in a pgptvii bar backbone designated as sxve mcherry c bar sxve mcherry n bar _PROTEIN_ sxve mcherry c bar and _PROTEIN_ sxve mcherry n bar or sxve gus bar and _PROTEIN_ sxve gus bar . in order to generate plant transformation plasmids that allow for monitoring of transgene _PROTEIN_ by detecting these proteins with strepii or ha epitope tags we cloned the inducible _PROTEIN_ cassette into pgptvii vector backbones resulting in plasmids named sxve strepii c bar sxve strepii n bar sxve ha c bar sxve ha n bar _PROTEIN_ sxve strepii c bar _PROTEIN_ sxve strepii n bar _PROTEIN_ sxve ha c bar and _PROTEIN_ sxve ha n bar . for efficient protoplast transformation the use of small plasmid backbones and high copy number plasmids that provide large amounts of dna after purification from escherichia coli is desirable . therefore based plasmids for inducible transient protoplast transformation were generated . to this end _METHOD_ mcherry and gus _PROTEIN_ vectors were generated in the plasmid backbones . this resulted in the formation of the plasmids sxve _METHOD_ c puc sxve _METHOD_ n puc _PROTEIN_ sxve _METHOD_ c puc _PROTEIN_ sxve _METHOD_ n puc sxve mcherry c puc sxve mcherry n puc _PROTEIN_ sxve mcherry c puc _PROTEIN_ sxve mcherry n puc sxve gus puc and _PROTEIN_ sxve gus puc . a similar strategy was used to generate protoplast transformation plasmids that _PROTEIN_ strepii or ha epitope tagged proteins . these plasmids were designated sxve strepii c puc sxve strepii n puc _PROTEIN_ sxve strepii c puc _PROTEIN_ sxve strepii n puc sxve ha c puc sxve ha n puc _PROTEIN_ sxve ha c puc and _PROTEIN_ sxve ha n puc . represents a schematic overview of the _PROTEIN_ cassettes available in pgptvii bar and vector backbones and a detailed listing of all generated plasmids is provided in . accession numbers of sequences of the inducible _PROTEIN_ cassettes can be found in . the sxve vector system is designed for transient as well as stable transformation purposes . therefore we first tested the transient inducibility of pgptvii constructs harboring _PROTEIN_ cassettes under control of the and _PROTEIN_ promoters upon application of different estradiol concentrations . to this end _METHOD_ as well as mcherry were used as model proteins to define the optimal hormone concentration leading to an appropriate induction and reporter gene _PROTEIN_ . leaves of n. benthamiana plants were transformed with agrobacteria containing sxve _METHOD_ c _PROTEIN_ sxve _METHOD_ c sxve mcherry c or _PROTEIN_ sxve mcherry c plasmids respectively . one day after infiltration _PROTEIN_ was induced by painting the abaxial sides of the leaves with and estradiol . mock treated control leaves were painted with a solution of ethanol in water . samples were analyzed by _METHOD_ microscopy d after induction . without application of estradiol no _METHOD_ or mcherry _METHOD_ was detectable in all samples analyzed indicating that both the promoter as well as the _PROTEIN_ promoter driven _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ do not bring about background _PROTEIN_ levels in n. benthamiana . upon application of hormone _METHOD_ _METHOD_ became visible although the intensity of _METHOD_ was not evenly distributed within the leaf area . the observed _METHOD_ intensity correlated with increasing concentrations of the applied inducer . upon application of or estradiol strong and evenly distributed _METHOD_ was observed . the intensity of _METHOD_ appeared to be similar at both concentrations indicating that the induction system was already saturated at concentrations of estradiol . the gradual increments of _PROTEIN_ induction with increasing estradiol concentrations implement a tight regulation of reporter protein _PROTEIN_ . although the overall _METHOD_ patterns were similar comparing and _PROTEIN_ driven _PROTEIN_ there was a difference in visible _METHOD_ intensity which can be ascribed to the different activity strength of the promoters . after d of induction _METHOD_ _METHOD_ in the _PROTEIN_ sxve _METHOD_ c infiltrated leaves reproducibly appeared to be brighter than in sxve _METHOD_ c infiltrated tissues . a very similar _PROTEIN_ pattern was observed when sxve mcherry c and _PROTEIN_ sxve mcherry c constructs were _PROTEIN_ . to analyze gene _PROTEIN_ at the protein level we extrac ted proteins from infiltrated leaves performed western blotting and subsequent immunodetection with _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ specific antibodies . equal loading of proteins was verified by staining the _LOCATION_ with _METHOD_ brilliant blue . this confirmed a strong induction of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ upon application of at least estradiol . longer exposure times of the _LOCATION_ allowed also the detection of the _METHOD_ protein in samples treated with lower concentrations of estradiol but led to an extreme overexposure of the bands at higher concentrations . similar results were obtained from immunodetection of mcherry proteins where detection at lower estradiol concentrations was possible due to a lower maximal mcherry _PROTEIN_ upon application of . together these results confirm an effective and dose dependent inducibility of the _PROTEIN_ plasmids and suggest a stronger _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ driven _PROTEIN_ cassettes . for subsequent experiments in transiently transformed tobacco leaves we decided to use the maximal concentration of estradiol . this rather high concentration should guarantee a saturation of induction thereby providing reproducible results and minimizing variations in the amount of estradiol caused by application with the paintbrush . next we sought to determine the temporal _PROTEIN_ characteristics of _PROTEIN_ sxve _METHOD_ c sxve _METHOD_ c _PROTEIN_ sxve mcherry c and sxve mcherry c in transiently transformed n. benthamiana leaves over a time course of d. as before plants were infiltrated and painted with estradiol on the following day . as controls mock treated plants were analyzed and for comparison constitutively active promoter constructs _METHOD_ were infiltrated in parallel . _METHOD_ and mcherry _PROTEIN_ was analyzed by _METHOD_ microscopy and immunodetection . importantly we did not observe significant protein _PROTEIN_ in all mock treated samples in both _METHOD_ and western blot analyses for the _METHOD_ and mcherry samples in these experiments . this result supports the notion that these _PROTEIN_ cassettes do not cause unwanted background _PROTEIN_ in the absence of the chemical inducer . in transformed tissues _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or mcherry under control of the constitutive promoter _METHOD_ became readily detectable d after infiltration which corresponds to d after induction for the inducible constructs . optical inspection of _METHOD_ did not indicate a further substantial increase in protein _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ or mcherry . however western blot analyses of _METHOD_ and mcherry _PROTEIN_ revealed a steady increase in protein amounts from to dpi . _PROTEIN_ of the inducible constructs resulted at the first and second days after induction in an unevenly distributed _METHOD_ throughout the leaf . during the following days the _PROTEIN_ intensity increased and the distribution of _METHOD_ became more consistent . western blot analyses with _METHOD_ or mcherry specific antibodies confirmed the increase in _PROTEIN_ of the proteins over time with maximal _PROTEIN_ at dpin . similarly to that described here for the inducible _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ constructs we also verified the functionality of our _PROTEIN_ constructs that harbored the gus reporter protein by analyses in transiently transformed n. benthamiana leaves . in all cases gene _PROTEIN_ was well detectable d after estradiol induction . together these results identify the estradiol inducible _PROTEIN_ vectors as superior _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ for the generation of large amounts of recombinant proteins in transient in planta _PROTEIN_ approaches . constitutive overexpression of proteins whose enzymatic activity alters cellular homeostasis or signaling can often be difficult or even impossible to achieve . this holds especially true for ion channels that affect cellular ion concentrations protein kinases that govern regulatory processes or respiratory burst oxidase homolog proteins _PROTEIN_ that generate reactive oxygen species . one such example is the _PROTEIN_ of the nadph oxidase _PROTEIN_ under control of the commonly used constitutive promoter . despite extensive optimization of transient _PROTEIN_ protocols including variation of amount and density of infiltrated agrobacteria cultures and alterations of incubation periods we at best achieved a faint detection of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ after transient _PROTEIN_ in n. benthamiana leaves . moreover such _METHOD_ could only be observed in very few cells making a judgment about the validity of the observed localization rather difficult . to exemplarily investigate the suitability of our estradiol inducible vector _METHOD_ for the _PROTEIN_ and analyses of such problematic proteins we cloned _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion constructs into the published and the _PROTEIN_ sxve _METHOD_ n plasmids . _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was monitored d after agrobacterium infiltration . while _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ under the control of the constitutive promoter was hardly detectable and required the application of maximal gain in microscopic inspections both inducible _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ permitted facile detection and analyses of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and localization respectively . these results underscore the value of inducible protein _PROTEIN_ for the investigation of problematic proteins in planta . transient single or cotransformation of protoplasts is an advantageous and fast method that allows studying of diverse plant signaling _METHOD_ . mesophyll protoplasts from arabidopsis and other species are compared to cell cultures genetically more stable and do not need subculturing and sterility . inducible _PROTEIN_ of transgenes in protoplasts would allow for fine tuning of protein concentrations by applying different estradiol concentrations and by using different incubation times . however currently available inducible _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ rely on rather large vectors that reduce transformation efficiency in these assays . to overcome this limitation we have generated inducible _PROTEIN_ plasmids in the small and well transformable vector backbone . to investigate the functionality of the sxve _METHOD_ c puc _PROTEIN_ sxve _METHOD_ c puc sxve mcherry c puc and _PROTEIN_ sxve mcherry c puc constructs these plasmids were transiently transformed into arabidopsis leaf mesophyll protoplasts . induction of protein _PROTEIN_ was performed after transformation by addition of estradiol to the culture medium . we tested different estradiol concentrations and found that turned out to be fully sufficient to induce _PROTEIN_ within . cells that were transformed either with constructs containing the _PROTEIN_ promoter or with constructs harboring the promoter showed well detectable protein _PROTEIN_ in response to estradiol induction in comparison to mock treated cells . we reproducibly observed more intense _METHOD_ in cells that were transformed with plasmids containing the _PROTEIN_ promoter as compared to cells possessing a promoter . transformation of protoplasts that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or mcherry under control of the constitutively active promoter served as a positive control in these experiments . together these results establish the functionality of the inducible vector system in studies that rely on protoplast transformation . induced overexpression of proteins allows investigating their function in cases in which a constitutive _PROTEIN_ is lethal or results in non sufficient protein _PROTEIN_ . furthermore application of different estradiol concentrations and analyses in a certain time range respectively allows fine tuning of _PROTEIN_ also for knockdown approaches . to further assay the functionality of our vector system we generated stably transformed arabidopsis plants by the agrobacterium mediated floral dip method . transgenic plants were identified by selection on basta containing medium and t plants were further analyzed . to verify the _PROTEIN_ patterns of the and the _PROTEIN_ promoters that were used as driver promoters in our inducible vectors both promoters were directly fused to the uida reporter gene in pgptvii gus plasmids and after transformation and selection the gus staining pattern of several t lines were determined for both constructs . despite the ubiquitous _PROTEIN_ pattern that is indicated for the at _PROTEIN_ gene in publicly available _PROTEIN_ databases and despite a previously observed ubiquitous _PROTEIN_ pattern of the promoter when fused to the uida reporter gene in alternative vector backbones we did not observe an even distribution of gus activity in all gus plants analyzed . instead we observed enhanced gus activity in vascular tissues and flowers of stably transformed arabidopsis plants . gus activity in leaves except vascular tissue and in roots was weak . we speculate that this _PROTEIN_ pattern results from epigenetic interference of the pgptvii plasmid backbone with the promoter upon stable integration into the plant genome . in contrast plants that _PROTEIN_ the uida gene under control of the _PROTEIN_ promoter exhibited stronger gus activity in all areal tissues of the plants and very strong gus activity in roots . to verify the functionality of inducible constructs we stably transformed and analyzed arabidopsis col plants with _PROTEIN_ sxve mcherry c _PROTEIN_ sxve gus and sxve gus _PROTEIN_ plasmids . reporter gene _PROTEIN_ was induced by transferring day old plants from _METHOD_ to _METHOD_ supplemented with estradiol and gene _PROTEIN_ was monitored after induction . mock treatments were performed by transferring plants to media without the hormone . in accordance with our analyses of the gus plants we observed in plants carrying the sxve gus transgene some gus activity in vascular tissues but this _PROTEIN_ appeared to be weaker than in the constitutively _PROTEIN_ plants . no gus staining was detected in the roots of these lines . in contrast transgenic plants harboring _PROTEIN_ sxve gus showed upon estradiol induction a more ubiquitous promoter activity which was detectable in all green tissues of the plants and very strong in the roots . this pattern of _PROTEIN_ reflected the gus staining pattern of _PROTEIN_ gus plants and indicates that the _PROTEIN_ sxve _PROTEIN_ cassette is fully inducible in arabidopsis plants . in general we did not observe gus staining in both the _PROTEIN_ sxve gus and sxve gus containing plant lines in the absence of estradiol induction . however it should be noted that in some _PROTEIN_ sxve gus lines we observed a weak gus background activity in leaves under non treated conditions that may result from some background activity of this promoter in the absence of estradiol or induction by as yet unidentified stimuli . we also analyzed _PROTEIN_ sxve mcherry c plants and observed strong _METHOD_ in root tissue endodermis and also root hairs . in shoots _METHOD_ was most prominent in guard cells . together these experiments establish the functionality of the estradiol inducible vector _METHOD_ in stably transformed arabidopsis plants . the somewhat surprising tissue specific pattern of driven estradiol induced transgene _PROTEIN_ in transformed arabidopsis plants prompted us to consider the use of an alternative ubiquitously _PROTEIN_ promoter as a driving promoter for _PROTEIN_ of the sxve cassette . in previous studies we had identified a bp fragment _PROTEIN_ of the arabidopsis ubiquitin gene as being sufficient to drive strong constitutive and stable _PROTEIN_ of transgenes in stably transformed plants . to enable the use of this promoter for driving estradiol induced gene _PROTEIN_ we exchanged the driving promoter by the _PROTEIN_ promoter in the pgptvii based _PROTEIN_ cassettes and in this way generated new plasmids . maps of the _PROTEIN_ cassettes of these constructs are depicted in and a detailed description is provided in . these plasmids allow the investigation of _METHOD_ mcherry gus strepii and ha tagged proteins as n terminal and c terminal fusion proteins . for all tags we generated basta selectable plasmids and in addition for _METHOD_ we generated plasmids that allow transgene selection also by kanamycin and hygromycin . to investigate the functionality of these vectors we transformed arabidopsis plants with _PROTEIN_ sxve _METHOD_ c and _PROTEIN_ sxve mcherry c and t plants were selected on media containing basta . for each construct at least independent transgenic lines were selected and day old seedlings were transferred to media containing estradiol . after of induction visual inspection revealed readily detectable _METHOD_ or mcherry _METHOD_ in at least of the seedlings analyzed . to investigate the stability of transgene _PROTEIN_ over a longer period of plant development we randomly selected lines and transferred them to soil . these plants were treated by spraying the lower side of the leaves with estradiol at day and at day . microscopic analyses d after induction revealed readily detectable _METHOD_ and mcherry _PROTEIN_ . these results identify the _PROTEIN_ promoter as a superior driving promoter for the estradiol induced transgene _PROTEIN_ in stably transformed plants . moreover these data suggest a high frequency of suitable _PROTEIN_ levels in independent transgenic lines and confirm developmental stability of transgene _PROTEIN_ . specific interactions of calcineurin b like _PROTEIN_ proteins with members of the serine/threonine kinase family _PROTEIN_ interacting protein kinases have been intensively investigated in recent years . the resulting _PROTEIN_ cipk complexes play important roles in regulating various abiotic stress responses and especially ion transport processes at cellular _LOCATION_ . most _PROTEIN_ proteins are localized at different cellular _LOCATION_ like the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ or the tonoplast while cipks when _PROTEIN_ alone reside in the cytoplasm and _LOCATION_ . previous studies reported that upon specific interaction with a cipk the _PROTEIN_ recruits the _LOCATION_ localized cipk to its target _LOCATION_ . so far all these studies relied on the use of bifc interaction experiments . however upon bifc the reconstituted _METHOD_ protein covalently _METHOD_ the chromophore thereby generating a non dissociable complex . therefore previous studies could not address whether _PROTEIN_ dependent cipk _LOCATION_ targeting efficiently occurs in the absence of artificial interaction stabilization . we sought to use our newly developed inducible vector set to address this important facet of regulation in the _PROTEIN_ cipk signaling network . to this end we used the tonoplast localized calcium sensor _PROTEIN_ and its interacting protein kinase _PROTEIN_ as a model system . _PROTEIN_ was fused to _METHOD_ under the control of the constitutive _PROTEIN_ promoter and _PROTEIN_ was fused to mcherry in the inducible sxve plasmid under control . upon co _PROTEIN_ this plasmid combination allows modulation of _PROTEIN_ mcherry _PROTEIN_ while _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was constitutive . as a control we co transformed sxve _PROTEIN_ mcherry with _METHOD_ only . two days after infiltration but before chemical induction plants were microscopically analyzed to investigate localization of _PROTEIN_ and potential leakiness of the inducible plasmids . green _METHOD_ of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ or _METHOD_ alone was distributed throughout the cytoplasm of the cell and also detectable in the _LOCATION_ . in contrast no _METHOD_ was detected in these cells confirming the absence of unspecific _PROTEIN_ . two days after infiltration _PROTEIN_ mcherry was induced by painting the abaxial part of the infiltrated leaves with estradiol and d after induction samples were again investigated by confocal microscopy . a dramatically altered subcellular localization pattern of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was observed upon induction of _PROTEIN_ mcherry _PROTEIN_ . most of the green _METHOD_ indicative for _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ localization was shifted to the tonoplast and co localized with the red _METHOD_ of _PROTEIN_ mcherry . simultaneously the _LOCATION_ localization of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ that was observed before induction completely disappeared in cells _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mcherry . line scan analyses over ranges encompassing the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ revealed a complete overlap of _PROTEIN_ mcherry and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ at the tonoplast . in contrast in the control the _LOCATION_ and cytoplasmic accumulation of _METHOD_ alone was clearly distinguishable from the _PROTEIN_ mcherry _METHOD_ at the tonoplast . also the line scan shows that _PROTEIN_ mcherry _METHOD_ at the tonoplast does not co localize with the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . this _METHOD_ that translocation of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ is due to the interaction of _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ and not to unspecific interaction with _METHOD_ . together these data provide the first evidence that a _PROTEIN_ protein can target a cipk to a cellular _LOCATION_ in the absence of any artificial stabilization of the _PROTEIN_ cipk complex . this result substantiates the notion that _PROTEIN_ proteins represent localization determinants of their interacting cipks . finally these experiments provide an example for the extended range of cell biological processes that can be investigated by virtue of chemical modulated gene _PROTEIN_ .
the minimal promoter and lexa binding site for the sxve fusion protein were amplified restricted using enzymes age i and eco ri and inserted into the vector . the _PROTEIN_ promoter reading frame of the xve fusion protein and the utr/terminator region from pea rbcs as originally designed in the vector were in vitro synthesized by the company geneart . in this step the codon usage of the xve reading frame was optimized for arabidopsis unwanted restriction sites were removed and new restriction sites were included to allow easy replacement of the promoter terminator and the reading frame between promoter and terminator if required . this synthetic dna was restricted out of the geneart cloning vector using hin diii and age i and inserted into the backbone containing the lexa and minimal promoter . the _PROTEIN_ promoter was exchanged with the which is the promoter of at _PROTEIN_ gene with a base pair substitution at position from adenine to thymine to delete a sal i restriction site . additionally a modified version of the _PROTEIN_ promoter with deleted bam hi restriction sites named _PROTEIN_ promoter was also inserted in substitution for the _PROTEIN_ promoter . the _PROTEIN_ promoter consists of a trimer of the octopine synthase upstream activating sequence and the mannopine synthase promoter/activator region . all four elements are fused together by bam hi restriction sites . the ocsuas and mas were amplified from the original psuper and the restriction sites hin diii eco rv bgl ii were introduced of the ocsuas and xba i was introduced of the mas . this fragment was inserted hin diii/ xba i into pbluescript and the bam hi site between ocsuas and mas was refilled by a klenow reaction resulting in a cla i restriction site in pks mas . in a second pcr a dimer of the ocsuas was amplified and inserted into pks mas using hin diii/ bgl ii . finally a second klenow reaction was performed to fill up the bam hi site between ocsuas and resulting in pks mas which was named pks psuperr . to generate constructs for arabidopsis and tobacco transformation the _PROTEIN_ cassettes were inserted hin diii/ xba i into pgptvii backbone vectors with basta resistance and appropriate mcs facilitating to generate n terminal or c terminal fusion proteins with _METHOD_ mcherry or gus respectively . in case of c terminal and n terminal _METHOD_ fusion additional plasmids were generated which contain either kanamycin or hygromycin resistance for plant selection . in case of gus only plasmids for c terminal fusions were generated . constructs for protoplast transformation were made by subcloning the _PROTEIN_ cassette including mcs fluorophore and nos terminator with restriction enzymes xba i/ eco ri into backbone . furthermore the _PROTEIN_ cassette was subcloned hin diii/ xba i from pgptvii into backbones carrying an ha or strepii tag in n terminal or c terminal orientation and subsequent subcloning using xba i/ eco ri resulted in pgptvii plasmids with ha and strepii tags . the gus cds was cloned xba i/ eco ri into the puc backbone harboring the sxve _PROTEIN_ cassette . for _PROTEIN_ containing plasmids a xba i restriction site in the promoter was deleted . subsequently this _PROTEIN_ promoter fragment was digested hin diii/ xba i and inserted into a hin diii/ nhe i restricted puc sxve containing plasmid . from this _PROTEIN_ sxve were restricted hin diii/ xba i and inserted into pgptviis containing fluorophores and tags in c terminal and n terminal orientation . all plasmids reported in this work are freely available for academic use and can be requested using the _METHOD_ provided on the webpage at www.uni muenster.de/biologie.ibbp/agkudla/plasmids.html . cdna of _PROTEIN_ was subcloned into sxve mcherry c using restriction sites bam hi/ xba i . for _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ n _PROTEIN_ generation the _METHOD_ n bar plasmid from was used . the promoter was replaced by _PROTEIN_ promoter digesting _PROTEIN_ from pks with hin diii/ xho i and pgptvii bar with hin diii/ xba i. xho i and xba i were filled in to create blunt ends . subsequent ligation resulted in the construct _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ n bar . _PROTEIN_ cdna was pcr amplified and inserted spe i/ xho i into _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ n bar . primer sequence can be found in available at molecular plant online . _METHOD_ was subcloned xba i/ apa i into kanii _PROTEIN_ resulting in _METHOD_ n kan. _PROTEIN_ was amplified with primers atrboh_f_bam_f and atrboh_f_xho_r and cloned bam hi/ xho i into pgptvii _METHOD_ n kan to generate the construct designated as _METHOD_ n _PROTEIN_ . the generation of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ n _PROTEIN_ construct is described in . for _PROTEIN_ sxve _METHOD_ n _PROTEIN_ the cassette including _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and nos terminator was subcloned xba i/ eco ri from _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ into _PROTEIN_ sxve _METHOD_ n . arabidopsis ecotype columbia was used for all experiments . plants were transformed by the agrobacterium tumefaciens mediated floral dip method . for selection plants were grown on _METHOD_ media supplemented with mg l basta . n. benthamiana plants for transient _PROTEIN_ were grown in the greenhouse in a h h darkness cycle . transformation of a. tumefaciens strain and transient protein _PROTEIN_ by n. benthamiana infiltration in week old plants was performed according to . after infiltration plants were kept under continuous light . _PROTEIN_ of sxve constructs was induced d after infiltration by painting defined estradiol concentrations on the abaxial side of the leaves . non induced controls were mock treated with ethanol in water . to induce transgene _PROTEIN_ in stably transformed day old seedlings they were transferred from selection media to freshly prepared _METHOD_ media supplemented with estradiol and induced for . to induce transgene _PROTEIN_ in older plants growing in soil lower sides of the leaves and flowers were sprayed with estradiol and plants were incubated for . arabidopsis leaf mesophyll protoplasts of week old plants were isolated following the tape arabidopsis sandwich method . protoplasts were transfected by the peg/calcium mediated method . transfected protoplasts were subsequently incubated for in the dark in six well plates before analysis under a confocal laser scanning microscope . estradiol induced protein _PROTEIN_ was started after transfection by adding final concentration of estradiol to the protoplast solution . controls were mock treated with a solvent control . microscopic analyses of concentration and time series were performed using an inverted leica dmi microscope set up . confocal microscopy was performed using an inverted leica microscope equipped with a leica tcs laser scanning device described previously . proteins were extracted from approximately plant material . therefore four tobacco leaf discs of cm diameter were punched from different parts of the leaf . plant material was milled
