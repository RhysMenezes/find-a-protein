non photosynthetic chlorophyll proteins called water soluble chl binding proteins are distributed in brassicaceae plants . brassica oleracea wscp and lepidium virginicum wscp are highly _PROTEIN_ in leaves and _METHOD_ while arabidopsis thaliana wscp and raphanus sativus wscp are highly transcribed in floral organs . bowscp and lvwscp exist in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ body . however the subcellular localization of atwscp and rshwscp is still unclear . to determine the subcellular localization of these wscps we constructed transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ venus fused atwscp or rshwscp . open reading frames corresponding to full length atwscp and rshwscp were cloned and ligated between the cauliflower mosaic virus promoter and venus a gene encoding a yellow _METHOD_ protein . we introduced the constructs into a. thaliana by the floral dip method . we succeeded in constructing a number of transformants _PROTEIN_ venus fused chimeric atwscp or rshwscp . we detected _METHOD_ derived from the chimeric proteins using a _METHOD_ microscope system . in cotyledons _METHOD_ derived from atwscp venus and rshwscp venus was detected in spindle structures . the spindle structures altered their shape to a globular form under blue light excitation . in true leaves the number of spindle structures was drastically reduced . these observations indicate that the spindle structure was the _LOCATION_ body . atwscp and rshwscp have the potential for _LOCATION_ body targeting like bowscp and lvwscp .
the aim of this study was to reveal the subcellular localization of atwscp and rshwscp . in previous studies we characterized the subcellular localization of bowscp and lvwscp by analyzing transgenic a. thaliana _PROTEIN_ venus fused chimeric bowscp or lvwscp and found that both chimeric proteins were located in _LOCATION_ bodies . here we constructed transgenic atwscp venus or rshwscp venus . similar to bowscp and lvwscp both atwscp and rshwscp possess an n terminal extension which is predicted to be a signal peptide . thus we introduced venus at the c termini of atwscp and rshwscp . all constructs used to generate transgenic a. thaliana are shown in fig . . the correctness of the transformants was confirmed by pcr analysis with the primer sets atwscp f or rshwscp f/vr and vf/vr . as shown in fig . we obtained a number of transformant lines.fig . analysis to confirm the correct insertion of cauliflower mosaic virus promoter atwscp venus and rshwscp venus into a. thaliana . primer sites are shown in fig . . was used as a control pcr analysis to confirm the correct insertion of cauliflower mosaic virus promoter atwscp venus and rshwscp venus into a. thaliana . primer sites are shown in fig . . was used as a control figure shows _METHOD_ images of leaves at different developmental stages from the transformants . in week old cotyledons of atwscp venus and rshwscp venus plants the _METHOD_ from venus was detected in spindle shaped structures . in the true leaves however most of these structures had disappeared and venus _METHOD_ was instead detected in the _LOCATION_ . furthermore the spindle shaped structures changed shape from spindle to globular during the _METHOD_ microscopic analysis with the high irradiation of blue light . brassicaceae plants have a unique spindle shaped organelle called the _LOCATION_ body . it was reported that the _LOCATION_ body changes its structure to a globular form and then fuses with the _LOCATION_ under high salinity conditions . recently et al . reported that raphanus sativus also has the _LOCATION_ body and that its shape was changed by methyl jasmonate treatment . we therefore concluded that atwscp and rshwscp can potentially target the _LOCATION_ body and the _LOCATION_ like bowscp and lvwscp but they do not target chloroplasts.fig . _METHOD_ images of the transgenic plants . one week old cotyledons and day old true leaves of the generation of transformants which were grown on agar plates containing full strength murashige and skoog medium and sucrose at under continuous light were analyzed by _METHOD_ microscopy . the chimeric proteins were excited by blue light and then the _METHOD_ images were captured . bar . dependent changes of the shape of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ bodies . _METHOD_ from week old cotyledons of rshwscp venus was captured . bar _METHOD_ images of the transgenic plants . one week old cotyledons and day old true leaves of the generation of transformants which were grown on agar plates containing full strength murashige and skoog medium and sucrose at under continuous light were analyzed by _METHOD_ microscopy . the chimeric proteins were excited by blue light and then the _METHOD_ images were captured . bar time dependent changes of the shape of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ bodies . _METHOD_ from week old cotyledons of rshwscp venus was captured . bar because atwscp has protease inhibitor activity and accumulates in the transmitting tract in the gynoecium and silique becktas et al . hypothesized that the protease inhibitor activity of atwscp might be important for the formation of the transmitting tract . note that we could not find any difference between the transformants and wild type a. thaliana . further analysis of the atwscp null mutant will provide clues to elucidate the biological function of atwscp .
arabidopsis thaliana was grown on agar plates containing full strength _METHOD_ medium and sucrose at under continuous light . three week old a. thaliana was transferred from the plate to jiffy for further growth . using a dneasy mini kit we extracted and purified genomic dna from leaves of week old a. thaliana according to the manufacturer s instructions . the full length regions of atwscp and rshwscp were amplified by pcr with specific primer pairs containing a restriction enzyme site for atwscp _PROTEIN_ and ccatggaacccgggaagtataagttgctagtagc for rshwscp _PROTEIN_ and ggatccgtagaatgggaacatcctcagacc . note that we used the rshwscp pgem t easy vector constructed in our previous study for rshwscp amplification . the pcr products were cloned into the pgem t easy vector . after sequence analysis the correct clones were digested and then the dna fragments were ligated into the same sites between the cauliflower mosaic virus promoter and venus in a modified vector constructed in our previous study . all constructs used to generate transgenic plants are shown in fig . . we introduced the constructs into a. thaliana using the floral dip method developed by clough and bent . transgenic plants were selected on agar plates containing sucrose _METHOD_ medium kanamycin and cefotaxime sodium salt . transformation of genes into a. thaliana was confirmed by pcr analysis with specific primer pairs . the sequences of the primers used to detect venus and were described in our previous manuscript .fig . image of the control and modified venus constructs for subcellular localization analysis of arabidopsis thaliana wscp and raphanus sativus wscp schematic image of the control and modified venus constructs for subcellular localization analysis of arabidopsis thaliana wscp and raphanus sativus wscp to obtain _METHOD_ images of a. thaliana _PROTEIN_ venus fused chimeric atwscp and rshwscp we used an plus microscope and axio cam with the axio vision software . the generations of transgenic plants were used for the _METHOD_ microscopic analysis .
