the arabidopsis mutation _PROTEIN_ impairs gene transcription acquired freezing tolerance and plant resistance to _PROTEIN_ under certain conditions . _PROTEIN_ was isolated through positional cloning and shown to encode an enolase in the glycolytic pathway . in animal cells enolase has also been known to function as a transcription _PROTEIN_ that represses the _PROTEIN_ of by binding to the gene promoter . _PROTEIN_ fused to green _METHOD_ protein is targeted to the _LOCATION_ as well as to the cytoplasm . _PROTEIN_ protein can bind to the of the human gene promoter and to the gene promoter of _PROTEIN_ a zinc finger transcriptional repressor from arabidopsis . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is induced rapidly and transiently by cold in the wild type and this induction is stronger and more sustained in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . furthermore the _PROTEIN_ of a _PROTEIN_ reporter gene is repressed significantly by _PROTEIN_ in transient _PROTEIN_ assays in arabidopsis leaves . our results demonstrate that gene transcription in plants is controlled by a enolase .
to facilitate genetic dissection of cold signaling we previously constructed arabidopsis plants that emit bioluminescence in response to cold temperatures . the plants _PROTEIN_ the firefly luciferase reporter gene under the control of the _PROTEIN_ promoter which contains the and osmotic dre/crt element and the abscisic acid _PROTEIN_ element . the _PROTEIN_ plants were mutagenized by ethylmethane sulfonate and mutants with aberrant luminescence responses were screened from the resulting population by luminescence imaging using a cooled ccd camera . one mutant designated as _PROTEIN_ shows a substantially reduced luminescence response specifically under cold stress and was chosen for detailed characterization . fig ref shows the _PROTEIN_ transgene _PROTEIN_ phenotype of _PROTEIN_ and plants when treated with cold aba nacl or polyethylene glycol . and mutant plants were grown on the same agar plate and bioluminescence images were taken after the respective stress treatments . without stress treatment no _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was detected in either the or _PROTEIN_ plants . in response to cold treatment for h plants showed strong luminescence emission . in contrast luminescence emission from _PROTEIN_ plants was very weak . aba nacl or peg treatment induced similar levels of luminescence in and _PROTEIN_ plants . these luminescence images indicate that the _PROTEIN_ defect in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is specific to cold stress . a quantification of the luminescence shows clearly that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ is virtually to cold but is still fully responsive to aba nacl or peg . the luminescence was times lower in _PROTEIN_ compared with the wild type . to test whether _PROTEIN_ plants display similarly reduced _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ transgene at different time points of cold treatment seedlings on agar plates were cold treated for or h and then used for luminescence imaging . as shown in fig ref the luminescence intensity of plants increased quickly in response to cold treatment and reached a peak level after h of cold treatment . in _PROTEIN_ plants the luminescence intensity was very low throughout the time course of cold treatment . to test the dominance of the _PROTEIN_ mutation plants were obtained by backcrossing _PROTEIN_ plants with the wild type . all plants exhibited the phenotype of luminescence _PROTEIN_ in response to cold treatment . the progeny of the selfed showed an segregation for wild type/mutant when imaged for luminescence after cold treatment . these results indicate that _PROTEIN_ is a recessive mutation in a single _LOCATION_ gene . rna blot analysis was carried out to determine the impact of _PROTEIN_ mutation on the transcript levels of genes . the endogenous _PROTEIN_ transcript level was greatly induced in the plants but this induction was lower in _PROTEIN_ mutant plants . induction of the _PROTEIN_ transcript by aba nacl or peg treatment was not affected by the _PROTEIN_ mutation . the effect of _PROTEIN_ on the cold induction of endogenous _PROTEIN_ is less dramatic compared with the effect on _PROTEIN_ . this is probably because the _PROTEIN_ transgene contains only part of the _PROTEIN_ promoter and there may be additional unknown regulatory elements in the endogenous _PROTEIN_ promoter or even in the untranslated regions or introns of the endogenous _PROTEIN_ gene . the difference between _PROTEIN_ and endogenous _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ levels has also been noticed in other mutants such as _PROTEIN_ . in contrast to the reduction of cold activation of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ mutation virtually blocked the cold induction of luc _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ kin and _PROTEIN_ genes . as with the induction of _PROTEIN_ induction of luc _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ kin and _PROTEIN_ by aba nacl or peg was not significantly affected or not at all affected by the _PROTEIN_ mutation . the transcription _PROTEIN_ genes are induced specifically by cold treatment . we compared the _PROTEIN_ of one of them _PROTEIN_ in and _PROTEIN_ plants . the _PROTEIN_ mutation had no effect on the cold regulation of _PROTEIN_ implying that _PROTEIN_ does not function upstream of the cbf genes . _LOCATION_ fluidity is an important determining _PROTEIN_ for cell _PROTEIN_ to both high and low temperature stresses . plants are known to increase in polyunsaturated phospholipids to _PROTEIN_ proper _LOCATION_ fluidity under cold stress . we determined the _PROTEIN_ of one of the desaturase genes . the result shows that _PROTEIN_ of this desaturase gene was highly induced by cold stress in the wild type . the induction was much diminished in _PROTEIN_ mutant plants indicating that polyunsaturation of _LOCATION_ phospholipids may not occur in _PROTEIN_ in response to cold stress . the compatible osmolyte proline plays an important role in freezing tolerance . the gene encodes the enzyme synthetase in proline biosynthesis . _PROTEIN_ was induced slightly by cold treatment and this induction was not affected by the _PROTEIN_ mutation . curiously induction by nacl appeared to be reduced whereas its induction by peg was enhanced in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . unless indicated otherwise all our cold treatments were carried out in the dark . under the dark cold treatments as well as under normal growth temperatures _PROTEIN_ plants behaved just like the plants and no visible phenotypic changes could be detected . however when _PROTEIN_ mutant plants were incubated in the cold under light a striking phenotype was observed the mutant plants wilted . the wilting of _PROTEIN_ plants first became visible at the leaf tips after days at and under light . after week the mutant leaves were entirely desiccated but _PROTEIN_ their green color . with prolonged cold and light exposure _PROTEIN_ plants became bleached and dead . in comparison the vigor and survival of plants were not visibly affected by even prolonged cold and light treatment . the wilting of _PROTEIN_ plants in response to cold and light treatment appeared to be a result of a water deficit because no wilting occurred when the plants were covered with a plastic film . however the mutant plants did not lose more water than the plants in the cold or at normal growth temperatures . furthermore the wilting occurred _PROTEIN_ of the amount of water supplied to the roots . we hypothesized that the wilty phenotype of _PROTEIN_ plants may be caused by impaired water absorption or conduction by the roots . it has been well documented that some _PROTEIN_ plants such as mung bean and tomato experience a sharp _PROTEIN_ in root hydraulic conductance and subsequent wilting when they are exposed to _PROTEIN_ temperatures . we performed a series of grafting experiments to test the water absorption/conduction hypothesis . the results show that wilting occurred when the grafted plants had _PROTEIN_ shoots but no wilting occurred when they had shoots _PROTEIN_ of the root genotypes . because the wilting phenotype has nothing to do with the root genotype the results clearly reject the water absorption/conduction hypothesis . since _PROTEIN_ mutant plants show _PROTEIN_ sensitivity we performed experiments to determine whether the effect of the mutation on gene _PROTEIN_ is also light dependent . luminescence imaging showed that reduced cold induction of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ seedlings occurred in either light or dark conditions . rna blot analysis revealed that _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ was diminished by the _PROTEIN_ mutation in either light or dark conditions . in contrast _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in either light or dark conditions was not reduced by the _PROTEIN_ mutation . these results demonstrate that although _PROTEIN_ plants show _PROTEIN_ sensitivity the effect of the mutation on gene _PROTEIN_ is not dependent on light . we attempted to examine the effect of cold acclimation on the freezing tolerance of _PROTEIN_ plants . and _PROTEIN_ plants were treated at under light for days and covered with plastic film to avoid the wilting of the mutant . the leaves were then excised and subjected to a standard electrolyte leakage assay . as expected the plants showed an increase in freezing tolerance and a _PROTEIN_ in electrolyte leakage in response to the cold acclimation treatment . surprisingly _PROTEIN_ leaves showed a dramatic increase in electrolyte leakage after the cold acclimation treatment . the results suggest that _PROTEIN_ cell _LOCATION_ became leaky when the mutant plants were exposed to cold and light consistent with the _PROTEIN_ phenotype . the _PROTEIN_ leaves that were treated for days at under light were examined under a transmission electron microscope . under the electron microscope _PROTEIN_ mesophyll cells were found to have disintegrated cell _LOCATION_ . _LOCATION_ blebbing was prevalent in _PROTEIN_ cells . these cytological changes indicate that the cold and light treatment induced cell death in _PROTEIN_ leaves . in order to avoid _PROTEIN_ sensitivity during cold acclimation treatment and _PROTEIN_ plants were incubated for days at in the dark . the method of xin and browse was then used to determine freezing tolerance . without cold acclimation treatment and _PROTEIN_ plants had the same level of freezing tolerance . for example both the wild type and _PROTEIN_ mutant survived freezing but neither survived freezing . however after the day cold acclimation treatment in the dark plants became substantially more tolerant to freezing than _PROTEIN_ plants . most of the _PROTEIN_ plants did not survive freezing at . on the contrary of the plants survived the freezing . even after freezing at of the plants survived . the data indicate that _PROTEIN_ mutant plants are defective in cold acclimation . to map the _PROTEIN_ gene genetically _PROTEIN_ plants in the _PROTEIN_ ecotype were crossed with plants of the columbia ecotype . the resulting plants were selfed and the progeny were planted and grown on _METHOD_ agar plates for days . luminescence images of plants after h cold treatment were obtained to select homozygous _PROTEIN_ plants for genetic mapping . representative molecular markers that cover five arabidopsis chromosomes were surveyed and the _PROTEIN_ gene was located to chromosome ii . further mapping positioned _PROTEIN_ to the lower arm of chromosome north of _PROTEIN_ . more refined mapping delimited _PROTEIN_ to a region covered by bacterial artificial chromosome clones and . for the fine mapping simple sequence repeats were identified from the bac sequences and pcr primer pairs were designed to amplify selected repeats to identify simple sequence length polymorphism markers . also sequence _METHOD_ between col and _PROTEIN_ ecotypes identified during candidate gene sequencing to find a _PROTEIN_ mutation were utilized to develop molecular markers . in summary with a total of _PROTEIN_ plants the _PROTEIN_ mutation was delimited to an kb region between the and markers . there are seven predicted open reading frames in this region . all genomic dna in this region including the seven orfs was amplified from the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutant plants and sequenced . this sequence analysis revealed a single g to a mutation in the gene that encodes an enolase . the mutation would result in the substitution of _PROTEIN_ by serine in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . to confirm that is the _PROTEIN_ gene the bac clone was digested with restriction enzymes ecori and saci which yielded a bp fragment containing the enolase orf plus bp upstream of _PROTEIN_ and bp downstream of the stop codon . the enolase fragment was cloned into the binary vector pcambia and introduced into _PROTEIN_ mutant plants via transformation . individuals were selected and their and progeny were subjected to complementation analysis with luminescence imaging . one representative line in the generation was chosen to illustrate its luminescence response to cold treatment . the result is presented in fig ref which shows that the gene complemented the luminescence phenotype of _PROTEIN_ mutant plants . in addition all of the transgenic _PROTEIN_ plants _PROTEIN_ the transgene were exposed to under light for a week . none of the transgenic plants wilted proving that the gene also complemented the _PROTEIN_ phenotype of _PROTEIN_ mutant . the transcript of the _PROTEIN_ gene was constitutively present in arabidopsis seedlings . the transcript level appeared to be slightly in response to cold treatment . the _PROTEIN_ mutation did not alter this pattern of _PROTEIN_ transcript _PROTEIN_ . we fused the _PROTEIN_ promoter region _PROTEIN_ to the reporter gene and the resulting construct was introduced into arabidopsis plants . gus _PROTEIN_ was detected in all plant tissues examined . the _PROTEIN_ protein level was also slightly by cold treatments . _PROTEIN_ protein was present in _PROTEIN_ mutant seedlings but the level appeared to decline after a day cold treatment . both the and mutant _PROTEIN_ orfs were _PROTEIN_ in bacteria to produce recombinant enolase proteins . in vitro assays carried out at showed that the _PROTEIN_ protein had a high enolase activity . in comparison the _PROTEIN_ mutant protein had a significantly reduced activity at . when the assays were carried out at both the and mutant proteins displayed much lower activities . at tissue extracts from _PROTEIN_ mutant also had a significantly lower activity compared with that from plants . at tissue extracts from both and _PROTEIN_ mutant plants had low activities and the difference between the and _PROTEIN_ plants was reduced . these results show that _PROTEIN_ is indeed an enolase and the _PROTEIN_ mutation disrupts the enolase activity at both warm and cold temperatures . therefore the _PROTEIN_ mutation is not a allele of _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ that _PROTEIN_ tissue extracts had a much lower activity compared with the extracts suggests _PROTEIN_ as the major contributor to enolase activity in arabidopsis . enolase has been implicated as a multifunctional protein in animals and fungi . for example in human cells part of the enolase has been identified as _PROTEIN_ that binds to the promoter and represses gene _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ is an alternatively translated form of enolase that simply lacks the first amino acid residues . as a glycolytic enzyme enolase is localized in the cytoplasm . as a transcription _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is localized in the _LOCATION_ . to examine the localization of _PROTEIN_ protein green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ was fused to the of _PROTEIN_ and the fusion protein _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis plants under the cauliflower mosaic virus promoter . fifteen independent lines were selected and examined for _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . undoubtedly _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was detected in the cytoplasm . however _METHOD_ was also clearly detected in the _LOCATION_ . the _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was detected at both cold and normal growth temperatures . _METHOD_ fusion with several truncated versions of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ gave similar localization patterns . human _PROTEIN_ has been shown to bind to the promoter and acts as a negative regulator of the gene . comparison of _PROTEIN_ and human _PROTEIN_ sequences revealed that the putative and repression domains are conserved in _PROTEIN_ suggesting that _PROTEIN_ may also be capable of binding to certain dna sequences perhaps sequences similar to the animal promoter element . to address this possibility we performed an electrophoretic mobility shift assay _METHOD_ using fusion protein . as shown in fig ref several bands were observed with a dna probe containing the human site in the promoter . the binding of _PROTEIN_ to the labeled human probe was competed off by unlabeled cold probe but not by a excess of poly indicating the specificity of the _PROTEIN_ dna interaction . since no homolog is present in arabidopsis other genes might be targets for _PROTEIN_ . the region of _PROTEIN_ is very similar to that of human enolase which serves as a repression domain . to identify possible target genes of _PROTEIN_ we surveyed the promoter sequences of arabidopsis genes encoding putative transcriptional repressors . we found that the region from to upstream of the translation initiation site of _PROTEIN_ which encodes a putative transcriptional repressor has similarity to the sequence in the human promoter . as shown in fig ref _PROTEIN_ was also capable of binding to this _PROTEIN_ promoter fragment . competition experiments with mutated _PROTEIN_ promoter fragment confirmed specific binding of _PROTEIN_ to this sequence . mutant _PROTEIN_ protein could also bind to the fragment . rna blot analysis showed that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was induced rapidly and transiently by cold stress in the wild type whereas in the _PROTEIN_ mutant the cold induction was stronger and more sustained . these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ negatively regulates the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ by binding to its promoter . to examine whether _PROTEIN_ represses the _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ gene transient _PROTEIN_ assays were performed in arabidopsis leaves . the _PROTEIN_ transgene containing an upstream sequence of the _PROTEIN_ gene fused to the luc reporter gene was delivered into arabidopsis leaves by particle bombardment . when the effector plasmid containing _PROTEIN_ under the control of the camv promoter was with _PROTEIN_ the luc activity was reduced to . this observation suggests that _PROTEIN_ represses the _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ gene .
