the plant cortical microtubule array is a unique acentrosomal array that is essential for plant morphogenesis . to understand how this array is organized we exploited the microtubule end tracking activity of two arabidopsis proteins in combination with frap _METHOD_ experiments of _METHOD_ tubulin to examine the relationship between cortical microtubule array organization and _PROTEIN_ . significantly our observations show that the majority of cortical microtubules in ordered arrays within a particular cell face the same direction in both arabidopsis plants and cultured tobacco cells . we determined that this _PROTEIN_ microtubule coalignment is at least partially due to a selective stabilization of microtubules and not due to a change in microtubule polymerization rates . finally we show that _PROTEIN_ microtubule coalignment occurs in conjunction with parallel grouping of cortical microtubules and that cortical array _PROTEIN_ is progressively enhanced during array organization . these observations reveal a novel aspect of plant cortical microtubule array organization and suggest that selective stabilization of dynamic cortical microtubules plays a predominant role in the self organization of cortical arrays .
one evolutionarily conserved and important property of proteins is the ability to bind the ends of mts with high affinity additionally a lower affinity interaction has also been observed along the sidewalls of mts . an earlier report by chan et al . who used a strong promoter did reveal the sidewall binding to plant mts and hence we asked if the use of weaker and/or endogenous promoters would allow more exclusive reporting of the mt ends . to investigate whether the arabidopsis proteins can associate with mt ends under low _PROTEIN_ conditions we generated transgenic arabidopsis plants _PROTEIN_ either _PROTEIN_ b or c fused with _METHOD_ under the control of the _PROTEIN_ inducible promoter which allows for fine tuning of _PROTEIN_ . under this carefully controlled condition we found that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ exclusively show cometlike structures _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ that appear to move rapidly in the cell . these comets disappear upon treatment with a mt depolymerizing agent propyzamide but not with latrunculin b which induces f actin depolymerization . in contrast to _PROTEIN_ and b induced _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ does not show cometlike mt labeling and instead it is localized to the _LOCATION_ . to determine whether the _METHOD_ localization patterns are conserved across plant families _METHOD_ proteins were similarly _PROTEIN_ in stably transformed tobacco by cells . our data showed that as in arabidopsis low _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ appeared in a cometlike pattern _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ whereas _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ is _LOCATION_ . the cometlike character with the bright side leading has been shown to be diagnostic of end growth and in all instances this behavior was observed in plant cells that _PROTEIN_ at low levels . in addition during mitosis _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ comets are seen to migrate toward and accumulate at the spindle midzone which is consistent with mt end localization because ends extensively interdigitate in this area of the spindle . accumulation was not observed at the spindle poles . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ are indistinguishable in _METHOD_ of comet growth velocity . notably in contrast to the low _PROTEIN_ conditions high _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in by cells using the promoter results in loss of end labeling specificity and more extensive labeling of mts which indicates the lower affinity sidewall binding site is present in plant . to further investigate whether functions of are evolutionarily conserved we examined whether can rescue mt defects in fission yeast that lack the ortholog . as shown in figure null cells are hypersensitive to drugs that destabilize mts such as tbz and this defect is more efficiently rescued by _PROTEIN_ and only weakly rescued by _PROTEIN_ . collectively we concluded from these results that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ like the mammalian and yeast counterparts display a strong mt end binding activity under low _PROTEIN_ conditions whereas _PROTEIN_ is a more divergent form . the mt end localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ provided a tool to examine the mt end distribution in the crowded plant cortical mt array . in isodiametric by cells the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ comets are oriented in random directions suggesting that these mts are not organized and thus displaying random mt end _PROTEIN_ . however in elongated by cells the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ markers revealed that the majority of mt ends _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ are oriented transversely with the same _PROTEIN_ . moreover optical sectioning of these cells showed that the cortical mt end _PROTEIN_ is continuous along all faces of the cell _PROTEIN_ . to better understand this phenomenon in organized tissues we also analyzed arabidopsis plants that were stably transformed with a construct _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ under the control of the native _PROTEIN_ promoter and found that epidermal cells containing transverse or longitudinal cortical arrays also display _PROTEIN_ mt end organization . using the same analytical approach as with the cultured by cells we closely examined cells in these organized tissues and observed an interesting pattern in which of cells with organized cortical mt arrays exhibit global cortical array _PROTEIN_ that is the same net mt _PROTEIN_ was observed in all regions of the cortex in these cells . furthermore the net cortical mt array _PROTEIN_ appeared to be cell autonomous i.e. one cell can contain mts of one _PROTEIN_ while its neighbor can contain mts of the opposite _PROTEIN_ . in the remaining of cells with organized cortical mt arrays regional variation in net mt _PROTEIN_ was observed . in such cells distinguishable belts or hoops of opposing mt _PROTEIN_ occur in the cell cortex . in these cells we noted a boundary area where mt dynamics appeared somewhat depressed as judged by a lower frequency of comets in this area . these boundary regions were not included in our quantitative analyses . similar to cells with global mt array _PROTEIN_ the net _PROTEIN_ within individual belts of mt _PROTEIN_ is on average . in all cases we typically observed the same net organization in neighboring cells but the net direction of microtubule _PROTEIN_ could differ . to determine whether the cortical mt organization as detected by labeling properly represents all the mts in the cortex we sought to examine the organization of mt _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis plants by tracking the direction of tubulin _PROTEIN_ polymerization which takes place at the end of the mt . to this end we performed frap to first photobleach a segment of cortical mts labeled by _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and then examined the _PROTEIN_ of these mts by tracking the direction in which _METHOD_ recovery occurred . in agreement with previous studies we found that the photobleached mts recovered fully within min confirming the high turnover of cortical mts . in support of our studies we observed that in the photobleached region the majority of the mts are of the same _PROTEIN_ . this is true of cells with longitudinal and transverse arrays . therefore _PROTEIN_ coalignment of cortical mts is a general property of parallel mt organization . we next examined how selective mt end alignment might be established . we asked if mts with the same _PROTEIN_ are somehow selectively more stable than those mts with opposite _PROTEIN_ . this quantification was performed by tracking individual comets appearing from within of the cell edge and determining their duration before they disappeared or exited the field of view at the other edge . comet loss due to mt pause or catastrophe was distinguishable from the occasional mt comets coming in and out of the focal plane because comet loss occurred asymmetrically starting from the tail of the comet to the distal end whereas mts coming in and out of the focal plane were distinguishable by the progressive blurring or sharpening of the entire comet . only those comets that remained within the focal plane during their lifespan were included in the quantification . these data are a measure of the duration of mt growth because dissociates from the ends of paused or depolymerizing mts . our data obtained from _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ by cells show that the average lifespan of the comets is significantly greater among mts oriented in the majority direction . mt comets oriented in the majority direction frequently followed the tracks of previous comets consistent with mt bundling following shallow angle mt encounters . on the other hand mt comets oriented in the minority direction frequently disappeared after encountering mt comets growing in the majority direction . these observations are consistent with the hypothesis that cortical mt array _PROTEIN_ is established through selective stabilization of copolar mts compared with antiparallel mts . we found no significant difference in the comet velocities between mts of opposing directions suggesting that mt polymerization rate is not the mechanism leading to net cortical array _PROTEIN_ . to understand the sequence of events leading to the establishment of cortical array _PROTEIN_ newly forming cortical mt arrays were examined in recently divided _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ by cells . after the completion of cytokinesis _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ comets populate the cortex in multiple orientations as newly nucleated cortical mts appear . in the initial stages of cortical array formation mts headed in multiple directions and typically only mt end coalignment was observed . in the subsequent stages of array organization the number of discordantly oriented mts _PROTEIN_ whereas the number of transversely aligned mts increases with no significant change in the total number of mts . simultaneously the number of mts with coaligned ends increases ultimately resulting in a net but not absolute cortical mt array _PROTEIN_ . this trend was consistently observed in all cells and the kolmogorov smirnov test confirmed that the distribution of mt angles after the completion of cytokinesis is significantly different from the distribution of mt angles h after the completion of cytokinesis . these results suggest that to order cortical mts the population of mts with the same _PROTEIN_ gradually enriches as more randomly oriented mts become parallel to one another .
the _PROTEIN_ b and c _METHOD_ fusion constructs were generated using recombinant pcr with the following primers _PROTEIN_ ggatccatggcgacgaacatcgga _PROTEIN_ tccggttgttgcggcggcttgagtcttttcttc _PROTEIN_ ggatccatggcgacgaacattgggatg _PROTEIN_ tccggttgttgcggcagtttgggtctctgcagc _PROTEIN_ ggatccatggctacgaacattgggatg _PROTEIN_ tccggttgttgcggcgcaggtcaagagaggaga _METHOD_ gccgcaacaaccggagccatgagtaaaggagaagaac _METHOD_ gagctcttatcccgctttgtatag . all constructs were confirmed by sequencing and subsequently cloned downstream of a _PROTEIN_ promoter in the vector and introduced into nicotiana tabacum l. cv . bright yellow cells and arabidopsis thaliana var . columbia plants using agrobacterium mediated transformation . the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ construct was also cloned downstream of the _PROTEIN_ promoter _PROTEIN_ in the vector and was introduced into a. thaliana plants using agrobacterium mediated transformation . transformed cells and plants were selected using mg/l hygromycin and independent transformants were used for subsequent analyses . heat shock induction was achieved by exposing by cells and arabidopsis plants to for h. preliminary experiments showed that this treatment regime did not perturb cell growth mt dynamics or mitotic index . although this treatment was mild we routinely followed heat shock with recovery for at least h at room temperature before conducting observations . a null mutant was transformed with the thiamine repressible _PROTEIN_ vector control or _PROTEIN_ containing arabidopsis orthologues or as the positive control . transformed cells were selected on appropriate minimal medium containing thiamine . colonies of cells were pregrown in thiamine free medium overnight to log phase before being serially diluted and spotted on plates containing thiabendazole or the solvent control . the standard yeast methods were as described . by cells d after subculture were observed by immobilizing them on poly l lysine coated coverslips in a humid chamber . two to d old arabidopsis seedlings were observed by mounting them on poly l lysine coated slides in distilled water . images were collected using either a c apochromat or plan neofluar objective . wide field microscopy was conducted with a zeiss axiovert tv microscope . images were captured with a coolsnap hq camera using light intensity from a w mercury arc lamp and _METHOD_ filter set at s intervals using s exposure times over a min period . mt orientation was quantified by determining the angle of mt growth relative to the long axis of the cell . for these measurements up to difference in mt angles was considered to represent the same direction because mt encounters at this angle resulted in mt coalignment of the time . mts that started out at divergent angles at the beginning of the movie but which subsequently became coaligned with other mts after mt encounters were considered to be oriented in the same direction . however if a rare mt changed direction more than at the end of the movie it was scored as a divergent mt . confocal microscopy was conducted with a zeiss meta laser scanning microscope . the nm laser line at power output was selected for _METHOD_ excitation and images were collected using s scan times . for the _METHOD_ recovery after photobleaching experiments photobleaching was achieved using three scans at laser power followed by image acquisition using laser power at s intervals .
