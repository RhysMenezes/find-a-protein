aluminum toxicity in acid soils severely limits crop productivity through inhibition of root growth and consequently shoot development . several arabidopsis mutants were previously identified as having roots with al hypersensitivity suggesting that these represent deleterious mutations affecting genes required for either al tolerance or resistance _METHOD_ . for this report the _PROTEIN_ mutant was chosen for further characterization . the phenotype of _PROTEIN_ is most obviously presented in al _PROTEIN_ roots as evidenced by exaggerated root growth inhibition in conjunction with increased _PROTEIN_ of al responsive genes compared to wt . using a map based cloning approach the _PROTEIN_ mutation was isolated and found to represent a deleterious amino acid substitution in a previously uncharacterized half type abc transporter _GENE_ which is _PROTEIN_ in a non al dependent manner in all organs tested . gus dependent analyses revealed that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is primarily localized to the root tip and the vasculature throughout the plant . concomitant with this an _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion accumulates at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ of root cells indicating that _PROTEIN_ may be important for intracellular movement of some substrate possibly chelated al as part of a mechanism of al sequestration .
several arabidopsis genes have been identified as being excellent molecular indicators of al responsive stress in roots . these include arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and atprxcb all of which show significant induction following treatment with moderately inhibitory levels of at low ph . in order to further characterize the al hypersensitivity demonstrated by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ patterns of these genes were assessed in col wt and _PROTEIN_ mutant roots prior to and following exposure to in a hydroponic environment which is a concentration of al that has only mild effects on col wt but causes substantial inhibition of _PROTEIN_ roots . as shown in fig . all al inducible genes tested were found to be _PROTEIN_ to significantly greater levels in roots of the _PROTEIN_ mutant compared to col wt which further demonstrates the increased al sensitivity associated with the _PROTEIN_ loss of function mutation . interestingly both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are genes associated with al resistance/tolerance yet increased _PROTEIN_ of these in the mutant apparently is not sufficient to overcome the loss of the _PROTEIN_ mediated mechanism of al tolerance since _PROTEIN_ roots are hypersensitive to al . the _PROTEIN_ mutation was originally localized to the top half of arabidopsis chromosome with linkage to marker _PROTEIN_ having been reported . in order to isolate the _PROTEIN_ mutation a map based cloning approach was initiated . for this approach a mapping population was generated by crossing _PROTEIN_ to nossen with this subsequently being screened for progeny that displayed poor root growth in a nutrient gel environment equilibrated with mm . nossen was chosen for this approach since it has a similar degree of al sensitivity as col which was necessary in order to build a bona fide group consisting exclusively of plants homozygous for the _PROTEIN_ mutation . genomic dna was isolated from leaves of mapping progeny and as shown in fig . these were screened for recombinants at the sslp markers and _PROTEIN_ which were found to flank the _PROTEIN_ mutation . identified recombinants were subsequently analyzed using closer caps markers that were previously published or generated for this cloning exercise with this analysis localizing the _PROTEIN_ mutation between the markers _PROTEIN_ b and . examination of this mapping window revealed an uncharacterized abc transporter _PROTEIN_ which is localized to this region . since _PROTEIN_ was previously found to encode an atypical abc transporter it was of interest to determine if _PROTEIN_ also represented this type of protein . _GENE_ was subsequently amplified twice from the _PROTEIN_ genome subcloned and sequenced which revealed a substitution of an a for a g in the mutant compared to col wt at the beginning of the ninth exon . this type of nucleotide change is consistent with the _METHOD_ mutagenesis treatment previously used to generate the als mutations . in the protein sequence encoded by _GENE_ this nucleotide substitution leads to an amino acid change of lysine to glutamic acid at position . analysis suggests that the _PROTEIN_ protein represents a half type abc transporter that is composed of two distinct domains . the amino terminal domain has at least four transmembrane regions as predicted by tmhmm and appears to have a structure typical of the _LOCATION_ spanning region of abc transporters . the _PROTEIN_ mutation lies between the second and third transmembrane regions in a portion of the protein that is not predicted to be _LOCATION_ localized . the _PROTEIN_ terminal domain is hydrophilic in nature with all of the required motifs associated with functional _PROTEIN_ of abc transporters . these include as shown in fig . both the walker a and b motifs the lsggq signature motif q loop and h loop . in order to verify that the mutation identified in _GENE_ was indeed _PROTEIN_ a genomic construct consisting of the promoter utr coding sequence and utr of _GENE_ was introduced into the _PROTEIN_ mutant via agrobacterium mediated transformation . lines that were homozygous for kanamycin resistance were subsequently tested for capability to grow in a nutrient gel environment equilibrated with mm . as shown in fig . functional complementation of _PROTEIN_ with the genomic construct representing _GENE_ resulted in complete restoration of growth of the _PROTEIN_ mutant in the presence of al . since it was not clear whether _PROTEIN_ represented a severe loss of function mutation it was of interest to examine a t dna insertion allele . for this analysis seeds from the t dna line which has an insertion in the eighth intron near the junction with the ninth exon and will be referred to as _PROTEIN_ for the remainder of this report were obtained and homozygous lines were generated by kanamycin selection and subsequent pcr based analysis for the presence of the t dna insertion . and seeds from a cross of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ had roots with greater than wt al sensitivity that was nearly identical to the respective mutant parents . seeds from col wt _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were subsequently analyzed for their capability for growth in both an soaked nutrient gel environment and an containing hydroponic environment the latter of which represents treatment of roots with physiologically relevant concentrations of al . for analysis of growth in hydroponics the nutrient solution was supplemented with mm homo _PROTEIN_ in order to _PROTEIN_ the ph at or near since arabidopsis roots have a propensity to significantly raise the ph of their environment which effectively reduces al toxicity . as shown in panels d e and f of fig . there is no discernible difference in the growth capabilities of roots of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ when _PROTEIN_ with al toxicity . when comparing growth of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ to col wt there is a significant to profound increase in al sensitivity demonstrated by the roots oof both mutants over a broad range of al concentrations suggesting that the _PROTEIN_ mutation represents a strong loss of function allele . northern analysis was performed in order to determine the organ specific _PROTEIN_ patterns for _PROTEIN_ and to assess whether this gene is al inducible . for analysis of spatial localization of _PROTEIN_ tissue representing leaves _METHOD_ and flowers was collected from week old plants . root tissue was collected from day old seedlings grown in a hydroponic environment . as shown in fig . _PROTEIN_ is found at comparably moderate levels in all organs tested suggesting that _PROTEIN_ functions throughout the plant . it was also of interest to examine whether the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutations affected transcript abundance . for this analysis roots of day old col wt _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ seedlings grown hydroponically were collected for rna extraction and northern analysis . as shown in fig . the level of the _PROTEIN_ transcript was comparable between col wt and _PROTEIN_ suggesting that the _PROTEIN_ mutation has no effect on transcript stability or turnover . the level of _PROTEIN_ transcript in _PROTEIN_ was also not affected compared to col wt although there was a significant increase in _PROTEIN_ transcript size in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . this shift in size suggests that since the t dna insertion occurs in an intron the insertion in this mutant negatively affects splicing of the _PROTEIN_ mrna in _PROTEIN_ and that this may represent a strong loss of function allele . to determine if _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is al inducible day old hydroponically grown col wt seedlings were exposed to either no or increasing concentrations of for days after which tissue was collected and used for rna extraction for northern analysis . as shown in fig . there is no apparent increase in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ even following treatment with which as shown in fig . is almost completely inhibitory to col wt root growth in a hydroponic environment . to further refine the pattern of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ a gus fusion localization approach was taken . for this the promoter _PROTEIN_ utr and coding sequence without the native stop codon of _PROTEIN_ were fused to the coding sequence of _PROTEIN_ in and introduced into col wt arabidopsis plants after which identified transgenic plants were examined for development of blue color following treatment with x _PROTEIN_ . from this analysis it was determined that _PROTEIN_ gus predominantly accumulates in vascular tissue throughout the plant . as shown in fig . incubation with x _PROTEIN_ revealed blue color primarily limited to vascular tissue in roots leaves _METHOD_ and flowers . cross sections of stained roots showed that gus activity was restricted to the ground tissue of the stele . additionally _PROTEIN_ gus roots demonstrated high gus activity throughout the distal portion of the root tip with gus activity abruptly shifting exclusively to the vasculature near the region that vasculature differentiation initiates in the root . high gus activity was also detected in leaf hydathodes including the area surrounding the water pore along with anther filaments pistils and flower receptacles . long incubation with x _PROTEIN_ gave limited yet detectable gus activity throughout the leaves and _METHOD_ suggesting that _PROTEIN_ might be primarily _PROTEIN_ in the vasculature with limited _PROTEIN_ in all cell types . in situ hybridization using antisense _PROTEIN_ as a probe was not successful . to identify the _LOCATION_ to which _PROTEIN_ localizes an approach in which _PROTEIN_ was fused to _METHOD_ was employed . for this analysis transgenic plants engineered with either pro _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or pro _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ which represents a translational fusion were generated and roots of homozygous transgenic lines were subsequently analyzed for patterns of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . as shown in fig . _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was found to be diffusely distributed throughout the examined root cells . in contrast examination of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgenic roots revealed _METHOD_ _METHOD_ that was almost exclusively localized to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ as shown by _METHOD_ patterns in which the observed _LOCATION_ wrapped around respective _LOCATION_ in the sample image . this was further evidenced by close examination of _METHOD_ in conjunction with counterstaining with dapi which is a dye that preferentially localizes to _LOCATION_ . from this analysis it was found that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was restricted to a tight band that passed around the dapi stained _LOCATION_ in the interior of the cell which is consistent with _LOCATION_ localization . since _PROTEIN_ is predicted to encode a _LOCATION_ spanning protein with capacity for solute transport and since it was never assessed whether the _PROTEIN_ mutation affected al accumulation following long term al exposure it was of interest to determine if a loss of function mutation in _PROTEIN_ impacted uptake of al or a specific nutrient from the growth medium . for these analyses col wt and _PROTEIN_ seedlings were grown for days in a hydroponic environment after which samples were treated for h with either or . following treatment roots from the samples were collected weighed ashed and analyzed using icp oes . as shown in table there were no apparent differences between col wt and _PROTEIN_ roots in accumulated levels of the macro and micronutrients following growth in the absence of al . this suggests that _PROTEIN_ is not required for facilitating nutrient uptake in arabidopsis . treatment with also did not result in any measurable difference in the level of total al in _PROTEIN_ roots compared to col wt suggesting that the _PROTEIN_ mutation does not impact an al exclusion mechanism . additionally treatment with al did not result in any measurable differences in nutrient uptake when comparing the mutant to the wt . coupled with the sub cellular localization pattern of _PROTEIN_ this suggests that it may function in intracellular redistribution of some as yet unidentified substrate rather than uptake into the root .
for all seedling growth experiments col wt and mutant seeds were surface sterilized and cold stratified at for days in the dark for synchronization of germination . seeds were subsequently suspended in agarose for sowing on either soaked gel plates or hydroponic plates . for experiments with soaked gel plates seedlings were grown for days on nutrient agar plates that were made and equilibrated with as previously described . for dose response analysis in a hydroponic environment nutrient media supplemented with mm homo _PROTEIN_ was prepared as previously described . seedlings were grown for days on mesh polypropylene screen in mm x plate dishes with ml of nutrient medium containing varying concentrations of . all dose response analyses were performed in a percival plant growth chamber under a h light cycle at . all adult plants were grown in soil under a h light cycle at in a plant growth room supplemented with sylvania gro lite _METHOD_ bulbs . for determination of organ specific patterns of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ root tissue was collected from arabidopsis col wt seedlings grown for days hydroponically . leaves _METHOD_ and flowers were collected from week old adult col wt plants grown in the previously described plant growth room . tissue was harvested and immediately frozen . for treatments plants were grown hydroponically for days after which they were transferred to nutrient media containing either no or varying concentrations of for days . following this tissue was collected and frozen for rna isolation . total rna was extracted using the rneasy plant mini kit . for all experiments of total rna were separated by electrophoresis in a denaturing agarose gel and subsequently transferred to zeta probe _PROTEIN_ blotting _LOCATION_ . labelled probes were generated using the prime a gene labeling system . prehybridization and hybridization were both carried out at and washes were done at and following the manufacturer s instructions . results were visualized by autoradiography . a mapping population was generated from a cross of _PROTEIN_ to nossen wt . seven day old seedlings that displayed the _PROTEIN_ phenotype which consisted of severely inhibited root growth following growth on nutrient medium soaked with mm were isolated and planted in soil for subsequent collection of leaf tissue and isolation of genomic dna . genomic dna was prepared as described and used as a template for pcr based mapping . to refine the map position of _PROTEIN_ which was previously attributed to chromosome we utilized either published polymorphic markers or developed novel caps markers for this region by generation of primers based on the published arabidopsis genomic sequence as previously described . caps markers generated for map based cloning of _PROTEIN_ were as follows . for the marker primers were gaatgggtctcaagctctcacg and ctgaaaatgaggcctcaagagag . sspi digestion resulted in three dna fragments for col and two for nossen . for the marker primers were cgtccatatcgacgttgtggtcg and cccttaaccagacctcatatctac . digestion resulted in two dna fragments for col and one for nossen . pcr reactions were comprised of cycles of for s for s and for min . the pcr reactions were then digested with the appropriate enzyme and the products were analyzed by electrophoresis through a agarose gel . upon generation of a genetic window of less than cm candidate genes were identified from the published arabidopsis genomic sequence . candidate genes were amplified by pcr with primers designed to the predicted and untranslated regions and pfu turbo subcloned into pgemt easy and sequenced by the university of florida dna sequencing core laboratory . sequences were subsequently compared to the published arabidopsis genomic sequence to identify potential mutations . for functional complementation analysis a genomic construct representing kb of upstream sequence utr complete coding sequence and utr for _GENE_ was subcloned into that had the gus coding sequence removed . this construct was introduced into the _PROTEIN_ mutant by agrobacterium mediated transformation and primary transformants were selected by screening for those that were kanamycin resistant . homozygous plants were subsequently analyzed by growth for days on nutrient agar plates soaked with mm alcl after which root length was determined and compared to col wt and _PROTEIN_ . gus analysis was performed by combining a genomic construct representing kb of upstream sequence and the complete coding sequence for _PROTEIN_ without the native stop codon with the _PROTEIN_ gene in . this construct was introduced into col wt by agrobacterium mediated transformation and kanamycin resistant transformants were selected . for analysis of _PROTEIN_ gus localization in roots day old seedlings were examined . for analysis of _PROTEIN_ in other tissues samples were collected from week old plants grown in the previously mentioned growth room . gus activity was visualized as previously described . microscopy was carried out with a leica dmr differential interference contrast light microscope . for subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ an _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ translational fusion was created . for construction of this the coding sequence of _PROTEIN_ without the native stop codon was combined with bp of the _PROTEIN_ promoter and the coding sequence of _METHOD_ in without the gus coding sequence . this pro _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ construct was subsequently transformed into col wt arabidopsis after which kanamycin resistant primary transformants were identified . for analysis of subcellular localization homozygous lines for pro _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and pro _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were analyzed using a leica confocal laser microscope . for localization of _LOCATION_ seedlings were stained with dapi for min prior to visualization . for quantification of total al in roots and shoots day old wt and _PROTEIN_ seedlings grown hydroponically were exposed to either no or for days after which they were washed with water harvested dried and ashed in pure nitric acid at . samples were resuspended in ml of nitric acid and analyzed using a perkin elmer optima dv icp oes .
