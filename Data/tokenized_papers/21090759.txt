the growing importance of vesicular trafficking and _LOCATION_ dynamic reorganization during plant development requires the exploitation of novel experimental approaches . several genetic and cell biological studies have used diverse pharmaceutical drugs that inhibit vesicular trafficking and secretion to study these phenomena . here proteomic and cell biology approaches were applied to study effects of brefeldin a an inhibitor of vesicle recycling and secretion in arabidopsis roots . the _PROTEIN_ aim of this study was to obtain an overview of proteins affected by bfa but especially to identify new proteins involved in the vesicular trafficking and its cross talk to the actin _LOCATION_ . the results showed that bfa altered vesicular trafficking and caused the formation of bfa compartments which was accompanied by differential _PROTEIN_ of several proteins in root cells . some of the bfa up regulated proteins belong to the class of the vesicular trafficking proteins such as v _PROTEIN_ and reversibly glycosylated polypeptide while others such as profilin and elongation _PROTEIN_ alpha are rather involved in the remodeling of the actin _LOCATION_ . upregulation of profilin by bfa was verified by immunoblot and live imaging at subcellular level . the latter approach also revealed that profilin accumulated in bfa compartments which was accompanied by remodeling of the actin _LOCATION_ in bfa treated root cells . thus profilin _METHOD_ to be involved in the cross talk between vesicular trafficking and the actin _LOCATION_ in a bfa dependent manner .
on the subcellular level bfa causes inhibition of secretion/exocytosis by aggregation of tgn and pm derived vesicles surrounded by _LOCATION_ stacks into so called bfa compartments in arabidopsis root cells . on the other hand the internalization of pm and _LOCATION_ molecules/compounds remains unaltered or even enhanced upon bfa treatment.citation such vesicular bfa compartments in arabidopsis roots can be easily visualized by the vital _LOCATION_ styryl dye . most root cells contained two to four larger bfa compartments stained by after treatment with bfa for h. because of this _METHOD_ reorganization of endomembrane system differential regulation of proteins associated with vesicle trafficking and _LOCATION_ was expected after bfa treatment with some of these proteins potentially accumulating in bfa compartments . to study and compare the root proteome in control versus bfa treated samples we exploited complementary gel free and gel based proteomic approaches to maximize the detection efficiency of differentially _PROTEIN_ proteins . the results are summarized in table citation which represents a fusion of two approaches mentioned above and also the overlap of two separate label free d _METHOD_ based quantitative methods . the optimized protein extraction resulted in successful resolution of the root proteome on two dimensional gels . twenty four out of these spots that passed computational quantitative spot analysis with the p value < were successfully identified using the maldi tof tof _METHOD_ . they are listed in table citation as differentially _PROTEIN_ . considering the _PROTEIN_ differences the _PROTEIN_ of only spots and spots changed more than fold after bfa treatment in comparison to the control . two dimensional electrophoresis was complemented with label free d _METHOD_ analysis . instead of relying only on basic turbosequest analysis and arbitrary commonly used xcorr cutoff values we opted for further processing of the data set . two _METHOD_ utilizing the _PROTEIN_ database were used to discover statistically significant differential _PROTEIN_ of proteins identified with high confidence . samples were analyzed in triplicates and graphs depicting their reproducibility can be found in citation together with detailed software outputs and complete lists of all identified proteins . figure citation shows the overall consistency in sample preparation and protein detection among the biological samples indicating subtle physiological changes due to the treatment rather than experimental _LOCATION_ . the protquant software revealed a total of matched proteins of which passed the p value filter to be considered differentially _PROTEIN_ . only those were given further attention . the protquant results were compared to output from proteoiq software . it identified proteins with _PROTEIN_ < and protein group probability > . the quantification of proteins is specified in relative _PROTEIN_ values . ninety percent of the proteins were found to be in the _PROTEIN_ interval and were in the _PROTEIN_ interval from to corresponding with the _PROTEIN_ of to fold and to fold in differential _PROTEIN_ respectively . the number of peptides and spectral count used for each protein quantitation mean values and standard deviations are given in citation . only proteins identified as differentially _PROTEIN_ by both protquant _PROTEIN_ proteoiq were further considered to be biologically representative of the bfa effect on arabidopsis roots . they contributed entries to the table citation . this relatively low number of proteins is a consequence of stringent criteria for high confidence identification _PROTEIN_ and applied _PROTEIN_ test p value cutoff for quantitative analysis that relied on the overlap of data from two label free quantitative softwares . while proteoiq uses spectral count the protquantcitation expands on the number of spectra by summing the xcorr values of each detected for particular proteins . this _METHOD_ to offer better statistical confidence to the quantitation and the table citation shows ratios and p values calculated by protquant . the proteoiq calculated ratios were almost identical for all practical purposes and therefore they are not shown . rigorous scrutiny of the proteomics experiment was applied to avoid false identification and quantitation that might have been misleading for investigating biological functions . attention is also needed to be directed to four proteins in the table citation that were identified by detection of one peptide but the single peptide was detected multiple times . citation table shows details for these proteins as well as annotated _METHOD_ spectra of their respective peptides . overall only of the listed proteins were detected by both d gel and d _METHOD_ principal approaches . this observation is commonly due to certain biases of the applied methods toward proteins of differing solubility mr and pi and it justifies using more than one proteomics tool to obtain more complete proteome picture . in our case the gel free and gel based overlap was likely lowered even more by applying quantitative methods with stringent statistics . the overlap of all proteins identified by two approaches was not examined since it bears no significance to the goal of this study . together of all proteins showing altered _PROTEIN_ caused by bfa were localized either in membranous organelles or at the pm . the proteins were classified into functional groups as shown in the figure citation . together these results show that the gel free and gel based proteomic approaches provided complementary sets of proteins differentially regulated by bfa . with respect to the role of bfa we expected differential _PROTEIN_ of some proteins involved in vesicular secretion . among them proteins which reside in secretory organelles such as _LOCATION_ and tgn could be expected to be up regulated in our approach using bfa . in _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ h _PROTEIN_ subunit b which makes a complex with other subunits including vha localizing to tgn and bfa compartments in arabidopsis citation was up regulated upon bfa . the complex of _LOCATION_ hydrogen ion transporting _PROTEIN_ synthase has a role in acidification of intraorganellar space providing environment for vesicular transport . another _LOCATION_ localized secretory protein named reversibly glycosylated polypeptide _PROTEIN_ which was previously shown to accumulate in bfa compartmentscitation was also up regulated upon bfa treatment in our experiments . these results suggested that proteins which are accumulating in bfa compartments after h of bfa exposure are up regulated . bfa was implicated in modification and regulation of the actin _LOCATION_ but the molecular mechanism behind this is unclear . thus one of our _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was to find cytoskeletal proteins affected by bfa . and indeed two actin binding proteins namely profilin and ef alpha were identified as up regulated proteins . in addition to the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ analysis upregulation of profilin was indicated by independent immunoblot analysis with profilin antibody . it illustrated that profilin was more abundant in bfa treated samples especially in the soluble fraction . furthermore live imaging using _METHOD_ tagged profilin revealed that instead of its _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ localization pattern observed in control cells profilin accumulated heavily in bfa compartments of bfa treated arabidopsis root cells . since profilin is known to regulate polymerization rates and dynamics of the actin _LOCATION_ citation we also have examined the organization and status of the actin _LOCATION_ . the stably transformed arabidopsis root cells carrying the in vivo actin reporter construct _METHOD_ were exposed to bfa treatments . the experiments displayed that the filamentous actin _LOCATION_ was less defined and the general cytoplasmic _METHOD_ signal increased in bfa treated cells . interestingly the remaining actin partially accumulated around bfa compartments which were simultaneously visualized by vital stain . next time lapse imaging provided evidence that these bfa compartments moved along the remaining actin cable tracks . calcium binding protein calmodulin _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was also up regulated by bfa . except for _PROTEIN_ other members of the cam family such as _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ might be also up regulated by bfa . this would suggest a very strong effect of bfa on homeostasis . since the sequences of cam proteins differ only in few aas it was not possible to unambiguously decide which of the cam proteins were present . the combination of two or more of them is possible . unique peptides were detected only for _PROTEIN_ . intracellular calcium ion homeostasis is essential for proper vesicular fusion and trafficking as well as for proper _LOCATION_ organization within a cell.citation hence upregulation of diverse _METHOD_ might significantly affect vesicular fusion events and endomembrane flow . such effects are regularly observed during the formation of bfa compartments composed of fused tgn and endocytic vesicles in arabidopsis root cells.citation our proteomic analysis revealed distinct changes in the _PROTEIN_ of proteins playing a role in protein folding . notably the _PROTEIN_ of these proteins upon bfa treatment was not uniform and seemed to depend on their localization . thus _LOCATION_ localized luminal binding protein _PROTEIN_ was up regulated while the _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ protein and putative t complex protein were down regulated by bfa . this suggests site/compartment specific effects of bfa in arabidopsis root cells . the upregulation of _LOCATION_ luminal chaperone _PROTEIN_ is likely connected to unfolded protein response in arabidopsis root cells as a consequence of bfa treatment . upr involves the slowdown of protein folding and temporary abundance of unfolded proteins in the _LOCATION_ lumen along with chaperones such as _PROTEIN_ to examine whether bfa affected proteins involved in upr response in our experiment we performed search for upr specific cis acting regulatory elements in promoter sequences of genes encoding proteins in our data set . this analysis revealed that four proteins possessed upr sequences and among them _PROTEIN_ and calmodulin were up regulated by bfa . moreover accumulation of _PROTEIN_ within _LOCATION_ might lead to abnormalities in _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ as a consequence of stress response due to impairment of vesicular secretion by bfa . to verify this possibility in living root cells stable transformed arabidopsis plants carrying _METHOD_ hdel constructcitation were used for visualization of _LOCATION_ after treatment with bfa . time lapse live imaging of _LOCATION_ revealed accumulation of _METHOD_ hdel signal within _LOCATION_ as well as _LOCATION_ proliferation in root cells treated with bfa . additionally detailed electron microscopy analysis revealed morphological changes in _LOCATION_ ultrastructure such as proliferation of _LOCATION_ elements as well as their inflation and swelling in bfa treated arabidopsis root cells . in most cases such swelled and proliferated _LOCATION_ elements were surrounding _LOCATION_ stacks at the periphery of bfa compartments . interestingly lumen of inflated/swelled _LOCATION_ elements regularly contained an electron dense material putatively representing accumulated proteins within _LOCATION_ . to gain information about the secretion of relevant proteins we screened proteins affected by bfa for possessing secretory signal peptide in their aa sequence using the web based software analysis program signalp .citation surprisingly only eight proteins _PROTEIN_ localized to the endomembrane system as predicted by wolf psort predictor citation contained a cleavage site for secretory signal peptide . moreover these were not uniformly regulated by bfa . four of them were down regulated suggesting possible degradation after the inhibition of exocytosis . in addition to _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ which regularly localizes to _LOCATION_ was also up regulated in our experiments thus suggesting its accumulation in the _LOCATION_ lumen . finally some proteolytic enzymes including cathepsin b like protease _LOCATION_ proteasome aaa _PROTEIN_ subunit _PROTEIN_ and probable mitochondrial processing peptidase subunit beta were down regulated suggesting that proteolytic processes might be altered by bfa . nevertheless other proteolytic routes for example those depending on calpain can not be ruled out in this study . in this respect we have found pest sequence as a signal peptide for degradation by both proteasome and calpain routes in four down regulated proteins .
