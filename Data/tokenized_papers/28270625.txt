tetrapyrrole biosynthesis is one of the most essential metabolic pathways in almost all _METHOD_ . coproporphyrinogen iii oxidase catalyzes the conversion of coproporphyrinogen iii into protoporphyrinogen ix in this pathway . here we report that mutation in the arabidopsis cpo coding gene _GENE_ adversely affects silique length ovule number and seed set . mutant alleles were transmitted via both male and female gametes but homozygous mutants were never recovered . plants carrying mutant alleles showed defects in gametophyte development including nonviable pollen and embryo sacs with unfused _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ . improper differentiation of the central cell led to defects in endosperm development . consequently embryo development was arrested at the globular stage . the mutant phenotype was completely rescued by transgenic _PROTEIN_ of . promoter and transcript analyses indicated that is _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in floral tissues and developing seeds . green _METHOD_ protein fusion protein was found targeted to mitochondria . loss of function increased coproporphyrinogen iii level and reduced protoporphyrinogen ix level suggesting the impairment of tetrapyrrole biosynthesis . blockage of tetrapyrrole biosynthesis in the mutant led to increased reactive oxygen species accumulation in anthers and embryo sacs as evidenced by nitroblue tetrazolium staining . our results suggest that the accumulated ros disrupts mitochondrial function by altering their _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ in floral tissues . this study highlights the role of mitochondrial ros homeostasis in gametophyte and seed development and sheds new light on tetrapyrrole/heme biosynthesis in plant mitochondria .
while screening in house developed t dna insertion mutant lines of arabidopsis a mutant with bushy habit and short siliques was identified . the mutant had a significantly shorter silique that contained fewer ovules . this mutant initially named _METHOD_ had a low frequency of seed set . the mutant plants showed seed sterility that included aborted seeds and aborted ovules compared with the wild type siliques which had only aborted seeds and aborted ovules . the genome walking approach was used to localize the t dna insertion in the mutant which identified the t dna insertion in the untranslated region of _GENE_ that encodes cpo . t dna insertion in the _METHOD_ mutant is diagrammatically represented in figure and the mutant is hereafter referred to as the mutant . another t dna mutant line having t dna insertion in the first exon of _PROTEIN_ was obtained from the arabidopsis biological resource center and is referred to here as . this mutant also showed high degrees of ovule abortion and seed sterility . the locations of the t dna insertion and position of primers used for genotyping and genome walking are shown in supplemental figure . the kanamycin positive progeny of the and mutant plants were analyzed by pcr to identify and isolate homozygous mutant plants . the pcr results confirmed that both the mutant lines are heterozygous for t dna insertion . additional pcr screening of the progeny also failed to identify homozygous mutant individuals . this strongly suggested the nonviability of one of the gametophytes or homozygous mutant embryos/seeds . as we could not recover any homozygous plants further characterization of the mutant was carried out with the heterozygous plants only . the occurrence of mutant plants in progeny of the mutant but absence of homozygous mutant plants indicated that the mutant allele is transmitted via at least one of the gametes . to determine the same reciprocal crosses were made between wild type and mutant plants . when selfed progeny of the mutant were tested for kanamycin reaction kanamycin resistant and kanamycin susceptible plants were obtained in a ratio . this significantly deviated from the expected ratio assuming the lethality of homozygous mutant progeny . when the mutant plant was used as female and pollinated with wild type pollen the progeny showed a kanr kans ratio of whereas in the reciprocal cross the ratio was . these results deviated significantly from the expected kanr kans ratio expected assuming that the mutation is lethal to either of the gametes and confirmed that the mutant allele is transmitted via both male and female gametes . male transmission via pollen was significantly lower than that from the female side . the transmission frequency of the mutant allele observed in the selfed progeny deviated significantly from the kanr kans ratio calculated based on male and female transmission frequencies observed in backcross progeny . the absence of homozygous mutants in selfed progeny clearly indicated that function is essential after fertilization for normal seed development which is ensured by the wild type allele in crosses between the mutant and the wild type . a complementation study was undertaken to confirm that the observed mutant phenotype is indeed due to the mutation . for this mutant plants were transformed with the binary plasmid containing the _METHOD_ gene cassette and the hygromycin selection marker gene . progeny were selected on hygromycin and were further tested by pcr for the presence of the mutant allele in these plants . a kb pcr product confirmed the presence of the mutant allele in hygromycin positive plants . when these plants were tested for the _PROTEIN_ of the _METHOD_ transgene by reverse transcription pcr the expected kb amplicon was detected in inflorescence and silique but no amplicon was found in wild type plants . all five such complemented plants examined showed normal siliques and nearly full seed set comparable with the wild type . these results confirmed that the mutation is the cause of the observed mutant phenotype . genetic analysis showed that the mutant allele is transmitted at a low frequency from the male side . therefore we made a detailed examination of pollen development to identify the nature of the defect in pollen development . upon alexander s staining and pollen grains from and plants respectively did not take any stain and were inferred to be nonviable . on the other hand pollen of wild type plants and _METHOD_ overexpressing complemented plants showed over viable pollen . dic microscopic analysis revealed that compared with the wild type most of the pollen in the mutant plants was collapsed and abnormal in shape whereas pollen of the complemented plants was normal . in mutant plants morphological defects were observed from pollen development stage . at stage the mutants showed well developed tapetal layer and normal tetrad similar to wild type plants but at stage the tetrads failed to release the microspores in the mutant . even those released from the tetrads failed to form an exine wall . as a result collapsed pollen was observed in mature anthers of the mutant plants . to find the exact defects in female gametophyte development the tissue cleared ovules from and mutants were examined with a dic microscope . at anthesis almost all ovules in the wild type contained one central cell _LOCATION_ one egg cell _LOCATION_ and two synergid cell _LOCATION_ . in both the mutant flowers at this stage to of ovules displayed a normal wild type like phenotype whereas to of ovules showed a pair of unfused _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ . furthermore and of and ovules respectively showed arrest at the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ stage of female gametophyte development . in transgene complemented mutant plants of ovules appeared normal . these data indicated that the mutation _PROTEIN_ impairs the fusion of the _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ to form the central cell _LOCATION_ of the embryo sac . in contrast to the wild type the embryo sac at stage _PROTEIN_ had comparatively smaller egg cells and persistent antipodal cells . to define the stage and nature of seed abortion in the mutant whole mounts of cleared ovules sampled at different times after fertilization were examined with a dic microscope . no differences were discernible at the zygote stage of development between the wild type and the mutant . the defects in seed development became evident at the early globular stage . a number of prominent doughnut shaped _LOCATION_ without any cellularization and with defective embryos were observed in the center of the embryo sac of mutant ovules . some of the ovules showed a lack of proper endosperm proliferation where developing embryos were arrested at the globular stage . in the mutant about of the aborting seeds had embryos arrested at the globular stage whereas in of aborting seeds embryo development proceeded beyond the globular stage and about reached the torpedo or cotyledon stage . values in parentheses are total ovules present in the silique . to gain further understanding of the defects in female gametophyte development the _PROTEIN_ of embryo sac cell specific molecular markers was analyzed in the mutant background . the mutant line was crossed separately with different cell specific marker lines namely and _METHOD_ . the plants carrying the mutant allele were identified and the ovules were examined for gus or _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . since the gynoecium of the heterozygous mutant plant contains both normal and defective ovules we tested the _PROTEIN_ of marker genes in defective ovules . gus _PROTEIN_ was observed in synergids of of ovules . similarly the marker showed gus _PROTEIN_ in egg cells of of ovules . these results suggest that both egg cells and synergid cells are properly specified in ovules carrying the mutant allele . _PROTEIN_ of the marker _METHOD_ was checked in wild type and ovules . while wild type ovules with fused _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ showed _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ restricted to the central cell of the embryo sac those with unfused _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ displayed green _METHOD_ in the two _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ of the embryo sacs . thus the _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ appear to have acquired central cell specification but failed to form a diploid central cell _LOCATION_ due to the mutation . the gene product is expected to play a role in the porphyrin biosynthetic pathway which is a bifurcated pathway of chlorophyll biosynthesis . available information shows that any defect affecting the synthesis of porphyrins would result in the accumulation of ros . to investigate whether disruption of the gene leads to ros accumulation nitroblue tetrazolium staining of anthers and ovules of wild type and mutant plants was tested . no nbt staining was found in mature anthers and pollen of the wild type whereas the mutant anthers showed strong nbt staining of pollen grains . in ovules no nbt staining was detected in the mutant or the wild type until the _PROTEIN_ stage . however at the _PROTEIN_ stage dark nbt staining was detected in ovules around the unfused _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ and in the micropylar region whereas in the wild type faint staining was observed in the micropylar region only . some of the ovules of that were collapsed showed staining in the entire embryo sac . thus nbt staining showed that disruption of function leads to high ros production in developing gametophytes . as per tair annotation _GENE_ has two exons and a bp intron and is capable of encoding a amino acid polypeptide . furthermore its transcript has a bp utr and a bp utr . the polypeptide sequence possesses a mitochondrial targeting signal mlkttispifssftgkpkcssklffrafskvvlqdtppsarrn at the n terminal end . a phylogenetic tree of cpo proteins prepared from different _METHOD_ like bacteria cyanobacteria mammals and plants including arabidopsis is shown in supplemental figure and supplemental table . on the basis of homology cpo proteins were found to be conserved across different _METHOD_ . to determine the similarity of with the two available analogs of cpos amino acid sequences were compared using homology search . the protein showed similarity with _LOCATION_ localized hemf cpo and similarity with mitochondria localized hemn cpo . it also has three elongator protein domains and a c terminal hemn domain . the elp domain shares significant sequence homology with the radical s adenosyl met superfamily . members of this family of bacterial proteins contain an fes cluster and use s adenosyl met to catalyze a variety of radical reactions . tetrapyrrole biosynthesis in plants is known to occur in the _LOCATION_ . however contains a mitochondrial targeting signal . therefore the cellular localization of was tested in mutant plants complemented with the _METHOD_ gene construct . to localize the mitochondria tissue was stained with mitosox red a mitochondrial superoxide indicator that selectively moves into mitochondria becomes oxidized and turns _METHOD_ . stained root tip tissues were examined for _METHOD_ and mitosox red _METHOD_ . a strong overlap was observed between _METHOD_ and mitosox red signals . a similar type of colocalization was observed in the mitochondrial cloud around the central cell of the mature embryo sac . these results confirmed the targeting of to mitochondria . documentation of the unfused _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ phenotype by dic and strong nbt staining around these unfused _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ in the mutant clearly establish the critical role of function for _PROTEIN_ cell fusion during gametophyte development . these results also confirmed that the mutation has disturbed ros homeostasis in both anthers and ovules and led to defects in pollen and embryo sac development . since encodes an enzyme involved in tetrapyrrole biosynthesis it is likely that this accumulation of ros is a consequence of disruption in the tetrapyrrole biosynthesis in the mitochondria which ultimately affects the functionality of these mitochondria around the central cell in this mutant . interestingly the _PROTEIN_ and oiwa mutants with defects in _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ fusion also display altered mitochondrial ultrastructure in the central cell . to verify the status of mitochondrial function within the embryo sac we used jc dye to monitor the mitochondrial _LOCATION_ potential . jc is a lipophilic dye that selectively enters into mitochondria and reversibly changes color from green to red as the _LOCATION_ potential increases . in normal cells showing high mitochondrial _LOCATION_ potential jc spontaneously _METHOD_ complexes giving intense red _METHOD_ . on the other hand in cells having mitochondria with low _LOCATION_ potential the dye remains in the monomeric form and exhibits green _METHOD_ only . ovules of the mutant and wild type plants were stained with jc dye and examined for its _METHOD_ to assess the functionality of the mitochondria within the embryo sac . embryo sacs of wild type plants showed comparatively more red _METHOD_ than green whereas in mutant embryo sacs green _METHOD_ was predominant over red . the ratio of red to green _METHOD_ in wild type embryo sacs was about whereas it was significantly lower in the mutant . these results confirmed that the embryo sacs of mutants have dysfunctional mitochondria around the central cell because of the accumulated ros which induces the damage to the organelle . the arabidopsis _METHOD_ browser database _METHOD_ _METHOD_ shows that is _PROTEIN_ in all plant parts with the highest _PROTEIN_ in dry and imbibed seeds whereas the genvestigator _PROTEIN_ pattern shows the highest _PROTEIN_ of in pollen and seed . rt pcr _PROTEIN_ analysis confirmed the presence of transcripts in _METHOD_ leaves inflorescences and siliques whereas no transcripts were detected in roots and seedlings of wild type plants . however transcript levels were reduced drastically in the mutant plants . since mutant plants are heterozygous these results indicate that haploinsufficiency of leads to the observed mutant phenotype . to determine the temporal and spatial _PROTEIN_ patterns of the gene a kb fragment upstream of the translation start site was pcr amplified and cloned upstream of the reporter gene uida in _PROTEIN_ vector and used to transform wild type arabidopsis plants . gus _PROTEIN_ was examined in five independent transgenic lines . weak gus _PROTEIN_ was observed in _METHOD_ leaves inflorescences and developing seeds . gus activity was detected specifically in anthers . in anthers gus _PROTEIN_ was found in the tapetum developing microspores and mature pollen . gus activity also was found in the central cell region of the mature embryo sacs of the ovules and in the endosperm of the developing seeds . thus based on in silico data of transcript abundance in different tissues and promoter activity determined using gus _PROTEIN_ we infer that the gene is _PROTEIN_ primarily in anther embryo sac and endosperm during seed maturation . to determine whether the mutation causes disturbance in the tetrapyrrole pathway we assessed the _PROTEIN_ levels of different genes of the pathway namely coproporphyrinogen oxidase _PROTEIN_ protoporphyrinogen ix oxidase _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ ferrochelatase _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and mg chelatase _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . quantitative reverse transcription pcr analysis using rna samples from the inflorescence revealed fold down regulation of transcripts in the mutant . the _LOCATION_ cpo gene _PROTEIN_ also showed fold down regulation . likewise _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ also showed to fold down regulation in the mutant . in contrast the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in the mutant was comparable to that in the wild type . these results show that the mutation affects the _PROTEIN_ of other downstream genes of the pathway . to further understand the consequences of these gene _PROTEIN_ changes on the accumulation of products of the pathway relative levels of coproporphyrin and protoporphyrin were estimated in the mutant and wild type plants through spectrophotometry . a fold increase in coproporphyrin level was found in ovules of mutant plants compared with the wild type whereas the protoporphyrin level was reduced by fold . thus the mutation disrupted the tetrapyrrole/heme biosynthesis pathway and caused the accumulation of intermediates .
the development and screening of the t dna insertion population of arabidopsis has been described . briefly the t dna promoter trap lines were generated by floral dip transformation of arabidopsis
