the rice gene elongated _PROTEIN_ encodes a monooxygenase that epoxidizes gibberellins in a deactivation reaction . the arabidopsis genome contains a tandemly duplicated gene pair _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ that encode eui homologs . in this work we dissected the functions of the two proteins . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ exhibited overlapping yet distinct gene _PROTEIN_ patterns . we showed that while single mutants of _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ exhibited no obvious morphological phenotype simultaneous elimination of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ resulted in increased _METHOD_ and enlarged organs . by contrast transgenic plants constitutively _PROTEIN_ either _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ were dwarfed similar to those overexpressing the rice eui gene . we also discovered that overexpression of _PROTEIN_ resulted in a severe dwarf phenotype while overexpression of _PROTEIN_ gave rise to a breeding favored semi dwarf phenotype in rice . consistent with the phenotypes we found that the _PROTEIN_ plants increased amounts of biologically active gas that were _PROTEIN_ in the internodes of transgenic rice with _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ overexpression . in contrast the precursor _PROTEIN_ slightly accumulated in the transgenic rice and _PROTEIN_ highly accumulated in the _PROTEIN_ overexpression rice . taken together our study strongly suggests that the two arabidopsis eui homologs subtly regulate plant growth most likely through catalyzing deactivation of bioactive gas similar to rice eui . the two may also function in early stages of the ga biosynthetic pathway . our results also suggest that _PROTEIN_ could be an excellent tool for molecular breeding for high yield potential in cereal crops .
a blast search revealed that the arabidopsis genome encodes two eui like _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ referred to hereafter as _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ respectively . the two arabidopsis proteins share identity with each other and identity with eui and contain all conserved amino acids for heme binding oxygen binding and activation and the _LOCATION_ triad motif known to be present in all cytochrome proteins . interestingly the two ela genes are located next to each other with only a bp interval with a retrotransposon next to the _PROTEIN_ promoter suggesting that they might be generated from a simple duplication . to determine the _PROTEIN_ patterns of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ we examined _PROTEIN_ activity histochemically in transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ an _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ promoter gus reporter fusion transgene _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . as shown in figure _PROTEIN_ gus _PROTEIN_ was observed in the shoot apical meristem petioles of young leaves and emerging leaves in sepals stigma anther and filaments of the developing flowers and in the receptacle and stigma of the developing siliques . similarly _PROTEIN_ gus was _PROTEIN_ in the sam and petioles of young leaves . in contrast _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ in the leaf margin and petiole vein of cotyledons with low levels of gus activity detected in the filaments of developing flowers and no gus staining detected in siliques . reverse transcription pcr analysis of _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ transcripts confirmed that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ exhibit partially overlapping _PROTEIN_ patterns . these results suggested that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ might be subjected to tissue specific functionalization through altering _PROTEIN_ patterns as is the case with many other ga genes . plant are usually anchored on the cytoplasmic surface of the _LOCATION_ and are occasionally associated with the _LOCATION_ . our previous study showed that the rice eui is localized on the cytoplasmic surface of the _LOCATION_ . to determine the subcellular localizations of the two arabidopsis ela proteins we transiently _PROTEIN_ ela green _METHOD_ protein fusions _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in onion epidermal cells . as shown in figures microscopic analysis of the transformed onion cells revealed a similar _METHOD_ pattern between the two ela _METHOD_ proteins and the m _METHOD_ _LOCATION_ reporter known to be localized in the _LOCATION_ . we also generated a fusion protein between _PROTEIN_ and the red _METHOD_ protein of discosoma sp . reef coral co transformed _PROTEIN_ dsred or dsred with the m _METHOD_ _LOCATION_ protein into the onion epidermal cells and examined their localization patterns . as shown in figures while there was little overlap between dsred and _METHOD_ _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ dsred was found to be co localized with the m _METHOD_ _LOCATION_ . these results indicated that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are most likely targeted to the _LOCATION_ similar to the rice eui protein . to investigate potential roles of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in ga metabolism the salk t dna _PROTEIN_ database was searched and one t dna insertional mutant for each ela gene _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was identified . the rt pcr analysis indicated that the two mutants are probably true knockout mutants . neither of the single mutants exhibited any observable morphological/developmental phenotype compared with wild type col during the entire life cycle . to further investigate the role of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in ga metabolism and plant development simultaneous elimination of both ela genes was desired . however due to their close chromosome locations it is impossible to create a double knockout mutant from two identified t dna insertional mutants . instead we generated an rna interference transgene for _PROTEIN_ transformed the resulting transgene into the _PROTEIN_ mutant and generated many independent transgenic lines . many of the _PROTEIN_ transgenic plants had bigger cotyledons enlarged rosettes and increased height in comparison with the corresponding wild type plants and also flowered days earlier than col . a increase was observed for the sizes of cotyledons and rosette leaves . the rt pcr analysis showed that the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ was efficiently silenced in the rnai plants exhibiting clear morphological phenotypes . we observed that these _PROTEIN_ transgenic mutants also produced larger flowers longer siliques and bigger seeds than the wild type during the reproductive stage . similar phenotypes were also observed in the transgenic _PROTEIN_ mutants _PROTEIN_ an _PROTEIN_ rnai transgene . scanning electron microscopy suggested that increased plant sizes of _PROTEIN_ probably resulted from enlarged/elongated cell size . taken together these results indicated that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ function together to inhibit plant growth . additional support for the roles of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in ga mediated plant growth and development came from our analysis of transgenic arabidopsis plants that overexpress _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or the rice eui gene driven by the constitutively active cauliflower mosaic virus promoter . all transgenic lines displayed severe dwarfism at all growth stages with deep green leaves . these results supported our prediction that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ probably function in ga deactivation despite our previous failure to detect the ga epoxidase activity for _PROTEIN_ using the yeast _PROTEIN_ system likely due to unfavorable assay conditions . it is interesting to note that _PROTEIN_ oe plants were smallest during the seedling and rosette stages while at the flowering stage eui oe plants were the severest dwarfs that failed to produce seeds . this finding suggested that enzymatic kinetics of the three proteins might be regulated by unrecognized co effector that are developmentally regulated . consistent with our interpretation exogenous application with nm _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and promoted the growth of the dwarfed _PROTEIN_ oe _PROTEIN_ oe and eui oe plants . as expected _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ could rescue the _PROTEIN_ oe _PROTEIN_ oe and eui oe plants similar to transgenic rice . interestingly _PROTEIN_ and also exhibited obvious rescue activity on these transgenic plants including eui oe probably due to the subtle difference of ga metabolism and signaling between rice and arabidopsis . we also carefully examined rosette leaves of the transgenic plants overexpressing ela or eui . interestingly leaf vascular patterns were significantly altered in _PROTEIN_ oe and eui oe transgenic plants . the development of leaf vasculature was disrupted in the transgenic plants particularly in the _PROTEIN_ oe leaves without secondary vein development . consistent with the growth phenotype the leaf vascular abnormality is less obvious in _PROTEIN_ oe lines . these results not only strengthened the argument of functional similarity between elas and eui but also revealed the critical role of gas in vascular patterning . electron microscopy analysis of the leaf transverse sections showed that cell sizes of the palisade and spongy tissues were greatly _PROTEIN_ in these transgenic plants compared with the wild type control . as expected epidermis cells were also smaller on the leaves of ela oe or eui oe transgenic lines than those of the wild type . consistent with their dwarf phenotypes the hypocotyl epidermal cells of the transgenic plants were significantly shorter than those of the wild type control with the _PROTEIN_ oe epidermal cells being the shortest . these observations indicated that overexpression of the rice eui gene or its arabidopsis homologs could cause multiple defects in cell and organ development . the rice eui gene feedback or feedforward regulates the genes involved in ga metabolism and signaling in the eui mutant and the eui overexpressor . we also found that some ga genes were indirectly regulated by _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ due to altered ga levels for instance _PROTEIN_ was strongly upregulated in _PROTEIN_ oe and _PROTEIN_ oe with different levels and _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were also slightly upregulated in _PROTEIN_ oe . we also observed that _PROTEIN_ was upregulated in _PROTEIN_ oe plants as well probably due to accumulated _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in the _PROTEIN_ overexpression plants which are _PROTEIN_ substrates . these results are consistent with the above hypothesis that there is a subtle difference between the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ enzymatic activity also with the observation that the _PROTEIN_ genes were slightly different in ga response . to test if the arabidopsis ela genes also function in rice we generated transgenic rice plants that overexpress _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ driven by the promoter . the second and third generations of several independent transgenic lines were grown in isolated paddy fields with the wild type control . figure shows that _PROTEIN_ oer lines were morphologically similar to the eui oe rice plants with severe dwarfism and _PROTEIN_ fertility . this severity of the dwarf phenotype of _PROTEIN_ oer plants correlated well with the _PROTEIN_ level of the _PROTEIN_ transgene indicating that _PROTEIN_ also has a strong ga deactivation activity in transgenic rice . similar to what was observed in transgenic arabidopsis plants _PROTEIN_ oer transgenic rice lines displayed the dose dependent semi dwarf phenotype . interestingly the _PROTEIN_ oer plants showed a good morphological pattern for high yield potential with more fertile tillers than the wild type . as a result grain productivity was significantly higher in the _PROTEIN_ oer lines than in the wild type control . our results suggested that _PROTEIN_ could be a good tool for molecular breeding for higher yield cereal crops . to further determine the biochemical function of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in ga deactivation endogenous levels of precursor and bioactive gas in the internodes of transgenic rice constitutively _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and in arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ plants were measured . our independent assays indicated that the levels of bioactive gas including _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were _PROTEIN_ or undetectable in the rice _PROTEIN_ oer and _PROTEIN_ oer plants similar to those in eui ox . intriguingly we detected slight higher levels of _PROTEIN_ in the rice _PROTEIN_ oer and _PROTEIN_ oer plants and a higher level of _PROTEIN_ in the rice _PROTEIN_ oer plants which was greatly _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ oer and eui ox . consistently we also detected _PROTEIN_ accumulation in _PROTEIN_ oer in comparison with _PROTEIN_ oer and eui ox . furthermore we detected slightly higher levels of _PROTEIN_ and its immediate precursor in the seedlings of _PROTEIN_ than in wild type plants . consistent with the finding in rice the level of _PROTEIN_ was slightly _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ plants compared with wild type plants . in further support of the function of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in ga catabolism our additional genetic experiments showed that ectopic _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in the rice eui rnai line greatly compromised the eui phenotype . these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ probably function in the inactivating reaction of bioactive gas similar to that mediated by the rice eui and also that the two might function in early stages of the ga biosynthetic pathway resulting in _PROTEIN_ accumulation and _PROTEIN_ might display additional activity on _PROTEIN_ biosynthesis . however those novel functions for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ remain to be confirmed .
a bp coding region of _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ was amplified by pcr and inserted into the rnai vector _PROTEIN_ . the construct was transformed into the t dna mutant _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ to generate more than independent transgenic lines of _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ . the stable homozygous lines of the double mutant were identified and used for phenotypic analysis . plasmids for overexpression were generated by inserting the full length coding region of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ into the rice _PROTEIN_ vector or then transformed into the wild type arabidopsis col and the wild type rice cultivar to generate more than independent _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ overexpression lines in arabidopsis and rice _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ respectively . six independent single insertion transgenic arabidopsis lines were identified in the generation and used subsequently for phenotypic analyses . rice lines were assayed with the second and third generations grown in the experimental field . plant height and other agronomic traits were measured in the mature period with more than plants for each line . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were ectopically _PROTEIN_ in an eui mutant by crossing _PROTEIN_ oer or _PROTEIN_ oer with a stable eui rnai line also in background . _PROTEIN_ kb and kb promoter regions of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were isolated and fused to _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ respectively . the _PROTEIN_ gus and _PROTEIN_ gus reporter plasmids were introduced into col to generate independent transgenic lines . gus activity was histochemically assayed in homozygous lines . according to the genomic locations and sequences of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ genes we got the salk t dna insertion lines and from the arabidopsis biological resource center . the mutant _PROTEIN_ contains a t dna insert in axon of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ a t dna insert in axon of _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ dsred fusions were made by in frame fusion of the full length _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ cdna with _METHOD_ or dsred in the vector . transient _PROTEIN_ of the fusion proteins and the controls _METHOD_ dsred and the _LOCATION_ localized m _METHOD_ _LOCATION_ in onion epidermal cells was performed using a helium biolistic device _PROTEIN_ as previously described . for western blot analysis antibodies against the conserved fragment of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were raised with standard procedure . protein extracts were prepared from seedlings of arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and rice _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . protein gel blotting was performed using the supersignal west chemiluminescence kit according to the manufacturer s protocol . total rnas were isolated from week old plants using _PROTEIN_ reagent and treated with dnasei using the dna free kit . first strand cdna was synthesized by superscript iii reverse transcriptase with poly primer . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were measured by rt pcr that was performed for cycles with of the first strand cdna and gene specific primers in a total volume of reaction mixture . the quantitative real time pcr experiments were performed for the arabidopsis ga metabolism and signal genes _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ using a roche lightcycler with lightcycler faststart dna master sybr green i kit using the primers as reported previously . primer sequences can be found in table . plant materials were fixed in a solution of acetic acid ethanol and formaldehyde at overnight and dehydrated in series with ethanol . for scanning electron microscopy the samples were critical point dried in liquid _PROTEIN_ and coated with gold followed by visualization with a scanning electron microscope . for histological sections samples were embedded in resin and transverse sections were made at . sections were examined microscopically and photographed . for ga measurements elongating rice second internodes and arabidopsis seedlings were harvested and lyophilized . the analysis methods for extraction and detection are similar to a previous report but modified to include the following targeted gas . the lc tandem _METHOD_ spectroscopy _METHOD_ system used is composed of a shimadzu uflc system coupled to an applied _METHOD_ qtrap _METHOD_ spectrometer _METHOD_ equipped with a turbo ion spray electrospray ion source . due to a potentially large number of known and unknown ga and related compounds as well as tissue specific interferences three multiple reaction monitoring transitions/data channels were used for detecting and quantifying each individual ga .
