_PROTEIN_ root formation in vascular plants is regulated by auxin . the _METHOD_ of lr formation are not fully understood . here we have identified a novel recessive mutation in arabidopsis thaliana named fewer roots that drastically reduces the number of lrs . _PROTEIN_ analyses of gus an auxin response reporter and gus an lr initiation marker suggested that fwr is necessary for the establishment of an auxin response maximum in lr initiation sites . we further identified that the fwr phenotypes are caused by a missense mutation in the _PROTEIN_ gene encoding an arf gef _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ which regulates the recycling of _PROTEIN_ the auxin efflux carriers . the fwr roots showed enhanced sensitivity to brefeldin a in a root growth inhibition assay indicating that the fwr mutation reduces the arf gef activity of _PROTEIN_ . however the other developmental processes except for lr formation appeared to be unaffected in the fwr mutant indicating that fwr is a weaker allele of gnom compared with the other gnom alleles with pleiotropic phenotypes . the localization of _PROTEIN_ green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ appeared to be unaffected in the fwr roots but the levels of endogenous iaa were actually higher in the fwr roots than in the wild type . these results indicate that lr initiation is one of the most sensitive processes among _PROTEIN_ dependent developmental processes strongly suggesting that _PROTEIN_ is required for the establishment of the auxin response maximum for lr initiation probably through the regulation of local and global auxin distribution in the root .
fwr was isolated from ethyl methanesulfonate _METHOD_ mutagenized a. thaliana seedlings as a single recessive mutant line that had fewer lrs . in day old seedlings the primary root length of the fwr mutant was slightly shorter than that of the wild type but the number of emerged lrs was dramatically reduced in fwr compared with that of the wild type . similarly the total number of emerged lrs plus non emerged lr primordia of the day old seedlings was also reduced in the fwr primary roots compared with that in the wild type primary roots . in day old seedlings lrs were formed in the fwr mutant but the number of emerged lrs was still reduced in fwr compared with that of the wild type . these results indicate that the fwr mutation _PROTEIN_ the number of lrs while allowing limited formation of lrs . when lr primordia were formed in the fwr no obvious stage specific developmental arrests were observed except that the transition from stage i to stage ii was slightly affected . in addition the organization of the fwr lr primordia appeared to be the same as that of the wild type . these observations indicate that the fwr mutation specifically reduces the frequency of lr initiation but does not drastically affect lr primordium development and lr emergence . fig . of the fewer roots mutant plants . ten day old wild type and fwr mutant seedlings . scale bar mm . primary

investigated the _PROTEIN_ of the xylem pole pericycle specific marker in the fwr mutant roots . was _PROTEIN_ in the xylem pole pericycle of the fwr mutant roots to the same levels as in the wild type suggesting that the identity of xylem pole pericycle is not affected in the fwr mutants . fig . identity of the xylem pole pericycle in the fwr mutant seedling . _PROTEIN_ of the enhancer trap

leaf and flower development and embryogenesis also appeared not to be severely impaired although the rosette leaf shape was slightly narrow and curled downwards compared with that of the wild type . this indicates that the fwr mutation _PROTEIN_ affects post embryonic root development specifically lr formation . to investigate whether the fwr mutation affects the auxin response maximum in the xylem pole pericycle which is the site of lr initiation we examined the _PROTEIN_ of a reporter gus _PROTEIN_ gene construct under the control of the promoter gus to monitor the auxin response maximum in both fwr and the wild type . the day old wild type seedlings had several lr initiation sites and lr primordia marked by a strong gus activity . in contrast the day old fwr mutant seedlings had almost no lr initiation sites and distinct gus activity was not observed in the xylem pole pericycle . these observations suggest that the fwr mutation led to _PROTEIN_ frequency of lr initiation with the auxin response maximum at the xylem pole pericycle thereby _PROTEIN_ the number of lrs . in order to determine upon which developmental step during the lr initiation the fwr mutation exerts its inhibitory effect we examined the _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ gene which is the direct target of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ for lr initiation . it is reported that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ occurs in the lr founder cells with an auxin response maximum _PROTEIN_ . in the day old seedlings strong gus activity was observed in the lr initiation sites at the xylem pole pericycle in the wild type background whereas almost no lr initiation sites with distinct gus activity could be observed in the fwr seedlings although weak gus activity was observed along the root stele which was also shown in the wild type . this indicates that the _PROTEIN_ gene was not adequately activated in the xylem pole pericycle of the day old fwr mutant seedlings . on the other hand when lr primordia were formed in the day old fwr mutant seedlings gus was normally _PROTEIN_ in the lr initiation sites and the developing lr primordia as observed in the wild type although the number of lr primordia was reduced in the fwr mutant . taken together these observations indicate that the fwr mutation inhibits the establishment of an auxin response maximum in lr initiation sites . fig . fwr mutation inhibits the establishment

_PROTEIN_ of gus in the mature root region of col and fwr seedlings . _PROTEIN_ pattern of gus in the col and fwr roots . scale bars . in the root tip similar gus _PROTEIN_ patterns were detected in both fwr and the wild type except that gus activity in the lr cap region tended to be absent or lower in fwr than in the wild type . this suggests that the fwr mutation may reduce auxin transport or signaling in the root tip region . taken together the fwr mutation affects the auxin response pattern in the root resulting in the reduced lr phenotype . based on the fwr lr phenotype we hypothesized that the fwr mutation might affect auxin responses . in order to investigate whether the fwr mutation changes the auxin responsiveness in the roots we examined the effect of exogenous auxin on primary root growth and lr formation . when day old seedlings grown on auxin free media were transferred onto auxin containing media and incubated for an additional d the effect of exogenously applied auxin on primary root growth was found to be similar in both the fwr mutant and the wild type . in the wild type lr formation was induced depending on the concentration of exogenous auxin and the lr density increased with auxin treatment . in the fwr mutant the auxin induced lr formation was observed with either iaa or naa and the lr density was restored to wild type levels . interestingly higher concentrations of auxin increased the lr density in the fwr mutant significantly more than in the wild type . these results indicate that the fwr mutant remains responsive to low concentrations of exogenous auxin to form lrs but shows enhanced sensitivity to higher concentrations of exogenous auxin strongly suggesting that the fwr mutation may attenuate auxin distribution for lr formation . fig

were obtained in each experiment . to isolate the fwr gene detailed mapping using the generation of fwr and accession landsberg _LOCATION_ was performed . the fwr gene was identified within an approximately kb genomic region of a bacterial artificial chromosome clone of chromosome . after sequencing the genes annotated in this region we found that the fwr mutant genome has a single base pair substitution in the gene which encodes _PROTEIN_ an arf gef that functions in vesicle trafficking and is required for embryogenesis . this mutation caused a missense mutation in the open reading frame that changes the serine to phenyalanine in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ domain . interestingly this serine residue is conserved among several _PROTEIN_ related proteins and in arabidopsis and and in animals suggesting the functional importance of this residue . _PROTEIN_ analysis by semi quantitative reverse transcription pcr showed that mutant _PROTEIN_ mrnas were _PROTEIN_ in the fwr mutant seedlings suggesting that the mutant _PROTEIN_ protein is _PROTEIN_ in the fwr mutant . to confirm genetically that the fwr is a mutant allele of the _PROTEIN_ gene the allelism test using a t dna insertion line of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was performed . the _METHOD_ line showed the aberrant seedling lethal phenotype in which shoot and root apical _METHOD_ were not produced similar to that of . all heterozygous plants of the fwr allele and the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ allele had a shorter primary root without any lrs which is a more severe phenotype than fwr but a milder phenotype than _METHOD_ indicating that fwr is genetically allelic to _METHOD_ . in addition we also performed a molecular complementation test by introducing the genomicgnom _METHOD_ construct into the fwr mutant . the fwr mutant plants _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ fusion protein under the control of the native _PROTEIN_ promoter _METHOD_ produced wild type levels of lrs . the primary root growth was also restored in the genomicgnom _METHOD_ seedlings . furthermore we confirmed that the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was observed at the specific compartments closely associated and partially overlapping with labeled endosomes in these transgenic root cells consistent with previous reports on the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . these results indicate that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ functionally rescued the fwr phenotype for both lr formation and primary root growth . to examine whether the fwr mutation affects the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ we also produced transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ the gnomfwr _METHOD_ fusion protein under the control of the native _PROTEIN_ promoter . interestingly the subcellular localization of gnomfwr _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was _PROTEIN_ observed at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ which is different from that of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . this suggests that the fwr mutation might affect the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ . however the gnomfwr _METHOD_ fusion protein was functional as well as the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in the _METHOD_ mutant background suggesting that the addition of _METHOD_ to the c terminus of the gnomfwr mutant protein might rescue the function . fig . fwr gene encodes _PROTEIN_ protein . protein structure of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and mutation point of fwr . _PROTEIN_ has

weak gnom alleles has a pleiotropic phenotype including dwarf shoots agravitropic roots arrested root meristematic activity and defects in lr primordium initiation and development _PROTEIN_ . however no gnom mutant allele has been reported specifically to impair lr initiation . it is noted that the embryogenesis shoot development and fertility were not drastically affected by the fwr mutation . these results indicate that fwr is a new partial loss of function mutant allele of the _PROTEIN_ gene which _PROTEIN_ inhibits _PROTEIN_ s function in lr initiation . to examine whether the fwr mutation affects the arf gef activity of _PROTEIN_ we examined the sensitivity of the fwr mutant to brefeldin a that inhibits the arf gef activity in vesicle transport . when day old seedlings grown on bfa free media were transferred onto bfa containing media and incubated for an additional d the primary root growth of the fwr mutant was more inhibited at either or bfa compared with that of the wild type indicating that the fwr mutation confers enhanced sensitivity to bfa mediated root growth inhibition . this result indicates that the fwr mutation reduces the arf gef activity of _PROTEIN_ thereby confirming that fwr is a weak gnom allele . fig . inhibition of primary root growth in col and fwr mutant seedlings . four day old seedlings grown on _METHOD_ medium were transferred to medium

subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ at the basal _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ which is important for several auxin dependent growth and developmental processes _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . to determine whether the fwr mutation affects the localization of _PROTEIN_ in the root we genetically crossed the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ line _PROTEIN_ into the fwr mutant and observed _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ in the fwr roots . as shown in _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was localized at the basal _LOCATION_ of the root stele cells in fwr as observed in the wild type . in the stage i lr primordia and _PROTEIN_ stages no distinct difference in _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ localization was observed between the wild type and fwr which suggest that at least _PROTEIN_ mediated auxin transport for lr formation is dramatically unaffected by the fwr mutation . fig . localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in col and fwr mutant seedling . subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in the stele cells of the root tip stage i lr primordium and

is important for lr formation it is possible that the fwr mutation impairs _PROTEIN_ dependent _PROTEIN_ auxin transport from the shoots toward the roots thereby inhibiting lr formation . to examine whether the fwr mutation in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ the levels of endogenous iaa in the roots we measured endogenous iaa levels in the roots of day old wild type and fwr seedlings by lc esi _METHOD_ _METHOD_ analysis . interestingly the level of endogenous iaa in the roots of fwr seedlings is much higher than that in wild type seedlings . these results indicate that that _PROTEIN_ negatively control the endogenous iaa levels in roots and that the fwr mutation inhibits lr initiation without _PROTEIN_ the total levels of endogenous iaa in the roots . fig . levels in col and fwr mutant
