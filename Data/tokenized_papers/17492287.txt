heterotrimeric _PROTEIN_ binding proteins consisting of and subunits function as molecular switches in many eukaryotic signal transduction pathways . in contrast to many eukaryotes plants contain very few g protein subunit _METHOD_ that mediate a diverse array of signalling functions . we investigated the contribution of cell type specific _PROTEIN_ and subcellular localization to this multifunctional signalling capacity for the arabidopsis thaliana subunit _PROTEIN_ . analysis of _PROTEIN_ promoter _PROTEIN_ fusions in germinating seeds seedlings and flowering plants revealed that _PROTEIN_ is widely _PROTEIN_ throughout development in a complex manner . as well as demonstrating similarities to existing arabidopsis g protein subunit _PROTEIN_ data several features of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ pattern align closely with known or proposed g protein functions . a c terminal _PROTEIN_ green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ fusion was localized at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and in the _LOCATION_ of leaf epidermal cells trichomes and root cells supporting previous evidence that plant g protein functionality relies on subcellular compartmentalization .
previous northern blot analysis of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ showed the presence of transcripts in whole roots leaves and flowers . to provide a reference point for detailed _PROTEIN_ analysis we performed an expanded northern blot analysis of whole seedlings and nine different mature plant tissue types . _PROTEIN_ transcripts were present in day old seedlings and all mature plant tissues at varying levels . developing and mature rosette leaves roots and _METHOD_ contained the highest transcript levels while siliques showed the lowest level . to investigate the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ pattern in more detail we generated transgenic arabidopsis plants _PROTEIN_ an _PROTEIN_ promoter gus transcriptional fusion _PROTEIN_ gus . the arbitrarily selected kb _PROTEIN_ promoter region also contains the entire bp coding region of the _PROTEIN_ gene starting bp upstream of the _PROTEIN_ translation initiation site . _PROTEIN_ is a member of the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ like gene family that is thought to be involved in ubiquitin mediated proteolysis . histochemical gus staining of day old seedlings revealed an identical _PROTEIN_ pattern at varying intensity levels in independent _PROTEIN_ gus lines which was typified by strong _PROTEIN_ in the stem and petioles . three lines with single copy t dna insertions were selected for further characterization and confirmed by southern blot hybridization as independent transformants . in germinating seeds at h after imbibition the strongest gus _PROTEIN_ was observed in the hypocotyl and apical meristem region . during early development gus _PROTEIN_ progressively appeared in cotyledons and root tips . a similar overall pattern was observed for day old seedlings . staining was most intense in the petioles and _METHOD_ including the apical meristem region but was faint or undetectable in the cotyledons and leaf primordia . _PROTEIN_ gus _PROTEIN_ was observed in the root stele although not in the lower root region close to the root tip including the zones of cell division elongation and differentiation . no staining was observed in the root hairs . close inspection of gus _PROTEIN_ in the root tip showed that it was confined to the root cap . for both germinating seeds and day old seedlings _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was considerably weaker compared to the promoter gus controls . in day old seedlings _PROTEIN_ gus _PROTEIN_ was strongest in petioles and hypocotyls including the apical meristem region . staining in the petioles continued along the mid veins of leaf primordia and leaves fading towards the leaf tip . although the leaf blades appeared to be unstained detailed examination revealed low level gus _PROTEIN_ in the guard cells . comparatively stronger gus _PROTEIN_ was seen in guard cells mesophyll cells and vascular tissues of cotyledons . cell specific gus _PROTEIN_ was also found in trichomes of leaf primordia and mature leaves . gus staining was present throughout most of the root system including root hairs with the strongest staining observed in the stele . examination of root tips showed that the gus _PROTEIN_ in the stele originates around the zone of differentiation . strong gus _PROTEIN_ was present in the root cap as observed for day old seedlings but was also found in the adjacent root meristem and zone of cell division fading in the zone of elongation . this pattern was also seen in _PROTEIN_ roots . as observed for germinating seeds and day old seedlings _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in day old arabidopsis seedlings was considerably weaker than gus lines driven by the promoter . mature _PROTEIN_ gus plants showed gus _PROTEIN_ in floral tissues with the highest levels observed in sepals and stamen filaments lower levels found in the gynoecium and anthers and very faint _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ . gus _PROTEIN_ was also observed in the floral buds of secondary branches being more intense in bud primordia . in siliques gus _PROTEIN_ was present in the wall and stalk but absent from seeds . similar to our observations in earlier developmental stages mature _PROTEIN_ gus plants showed intense gus staining in _METHOD_ and rosette petioles extending into the mid veins and vascular tissue of the blades . gus _PROTEIN_ in cauline leaves followed the same pattern but was comparatively weaker . cell specific gus _PROTEIN_ was present in trichomes of rosette leaves and cauline leaves . gus staining was present in all stem tissue types with greater intensity observed in the cortex and vascular tissues . as for day old seedlings gus _PROTEIN_ was present in most of the root system and was strongest in the stele . however staining was almost absent in _PROTEIN_ roots and less obvious in root caps . strong gus _PROTEIN_ was observed in the promoter control line for all tissues examined . we investigated the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ using _METHOD_ tagging . to minimise the possibility of interference with dimer formation and _LOCATION_ anchorage a c terminal _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion was chosen . this arrangement is not expected to interfere with _LOCATION_ association and indeed a similar _METHOD_ fusion _PROTEIN_ in transgenic tobacco was shown to associate with microsomes in the same way as _PROTEIN_ in wild type arabidopsis . the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion was created by adding the coding region of _METHOD_ immediately behind the full coding region of _PROTEIN_ . transgenic arabidopsis plants _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein under the control of the promoter were examined by confocal laser scanning microscopy _PROTEIN_ . eleven day old seedlings from five independently transformed lines showed identical subcellular localization patterns characterized by _METHOD_ _METHOD_ at the periphery of the cytoplasm in leaf epidermal cells suggesting that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was present at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . the _METHOD_ layer was not homogenous but instead formed discrete node like structures . although weaker than the non targeted and _LOCATION_ targeted _METHOD_ controls the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ in _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgenic lines was clearly distinguishable from _METHOD_ in wild type leaf epidermal cells . no agrobacterium growth was observed when the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ lines were grown on nutrient media and the agrobacterium strain containing the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ construct used for arabidopsis transformation did not show significant _METHOD_ when examined by _PROTEIN_ with identical settings . hence the _METHOD_ pattern observed of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion could not have resulted from persistent agrobacterium growth . in the absence of a targeting signal _METHOD_ localises to the cytoplasm and also diffuses into the _LOCATION_ . the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ pattern is clearly distinguishable from the pattern observed in non targeted _METHOD_ plants being thinner and different in shape . the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion _METHOD_ signal is also distinct from _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ targeted _METHOD_ which lines the periphery of the cytoplasm but also _METHOD_ a reticulate pattern within it and surrounds the _LOCATION_ . in some cells the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ signal also _METHOD_ filamentous structures that may represent the _LOCATION_ or cell cortex . however _LOCATION_ targeted _METHOD_ has a similar appearance suggesting that the filamentous structures simply represent _METHOD_ _METHOD_ associated with the inner boundary of the cytoplasm that is closely aligned with the plane of the optical section . in addition to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein is associated with _METHOD_ labelled structures that can be identified as _LOCATION_ by their number size appearance and position within the cells when compared with non targeted and _LOCATION_ targeted _METHOD_ lines . non targeted _METHOD_ diffuses into _LOCATION_ because it is smaller than the _LOCATION_ pore exclusion limit of approximately kda . thus the presence of the kda _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein in the _LOCATION_ indicates active targeting . an identical pattern of _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ localization was also observed in leaf trichomes and roots . in the large trichome cells non _METHOD_ nucleoli were clearly identified demonstrating that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ is located within the _LOCATION_ and not associated with the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . in both trichomes and root cells the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ localized _METHOD_ signal contained node like structures similar to those seen in leaf epidermal cells .

blot was re probed with a wheat ribosomal rna gene for total rna loading normalization . for the _PROTEIN_ gus construct the _PROTEIN_ promoter region was amplified by pcr from arabidopsis genomic dna using the _PROTEIN_ primer _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ located approximately kb upstream from the transcription initiation site and the _PROTEIN_ primer _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ located at the

confirmed by sequencing . the _PROTEIN_ fragment was excised with xhoi/bamhi and ligated into paov intron gus inserted into the promoter/nos terminator cassette of paov kindly provided by dr. j. s.

removing the xhoi site by digestion filling of the ends and re ligation . this plasmid was then digested with smai and used to blunt clone the kb _PROTEIN_ rt pcr product . to create the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion a clone containing the _PROTEIN_ cdna in orientation was digested with xhoi and then ligated to an xhoi fragment containing the _METHOD_ gene excised from pbs _METHOD_ . the plasmid pbs _METHOD_ comprises _METHOD_ _LOCATION_ amplified without the _LOCATION_ signal peptide or _LOCATION_ retention signal using the primers _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and ligated into ecorv cut pbluescript skii . the binary transformation vector _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was created by excising the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion with bamhi/psti and sub cloning into . binary vectors were introduced into agrobacterium tumefaciens strain by triparental mating as described by svab et al . using the e. coli helper strain _PROTEIN_ . wild type arabidopsis thaliana ecotype columbia was transformed according to the vacuum infiltration method of bechtold et al . and transformants selected by spraying with v/v _PROTEIN_ initially at the emergence of cotyledons then twice again at day intervals . the promoter control line was kindly provided by dr. j. s. mylne . for comparative purposes gus histochemical characterization of the _PROTEIN_ gus lines was modelled on a
