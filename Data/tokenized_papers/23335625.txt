a common response by plants to fungal attack is deposition of callose a _PROTEIN_ polymer in the form of cell wall _PROTEIN_ called papillae at site of wall penetration . while it has been generally believed that the papillae provide a structural barrier to slow fungal penetration this idea has been _PROTEIN_ in recent studies of arabidopsis where fungal resistance was found to be independent of callose deposition . to the contrary we show that callose can strongly support penetration resistance when deposited in elevated amounts at early time points of infection . we generated transgenic arabidopsis lines that _PROTEIN_ powdery mildew _PROTEIN_ which encodes a stress induced callose synthase under the control of the constitutive promoter . in these lines we detected callose synthase activity that was four times higher than that in wild type plants h post inoculation with the virulent powdery mildew golovinomyces cichoracearum . the callose synthase activity was correlated with enlarged callose deposits and the focal accumulation of green _METHOD_ protein tagged _PROTEIN_ at sites of attempted fungal penetration . we observed similar results from infection studies with the nonadapted powdery mildew blumeria graminis f. sp . hordei . haustoria formation was prevented in resistant transgenic lines during both types of powdery mildew infection and neither the salicylic acid dependent nor jasmonate dependent pathways were induced . we present a schematic model that highlights the differences in callose deposition between the resistant transgenic lines and the susceptible wild type plants during compatible and incompatible interactions between arabidopsis and powdery mildew .
three week old arabidopsis plants were inoculated with the virulent powdery mildew gc . at d post inoculation wild type plants demonstrated the typical whitish powdery appearance associated with good fungal conidiation . the _PROTEIN_ mutant showed the described disease phenotype of yellow necrotic leaves without macroscopically recognizable pathogen growth . only _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ leaves were free from disease _METHOD_ . the infection did not reduce _METHOD_ production in these plants as it did in wild type and _PROTEIN_ plants . these phenotypes were confirmed for four independent _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ lines . aniline blue staining allowed visualization of callose through _METHOD_ microscopy . the specificity of aniline blue for staining of callose under our preparative conditions was confirmed in a colocalization study with parallel immunohistochemical labeling of callose using a specific anti callose antibody . at dpi gc infection induced strong callose deposition not only in epidermal cells but also in underlying mesophyll cells thereby forming connected callose patches in the wild type plants . only single callose spots were detected in the epidermal cells of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ leaves . callose deposition did not occur in _PROTEIN_ plants . untreated control leaves of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ lines did not show aberrant or additional callose deposition relative to wild type plants as confirmed by immunochemical determination of the total callose amount in the control leaf tissue . the callose amount in the _PROTEIN_ mutant was significantly reduced relative to the wild type and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ lines . trypan blue stained leaves were microscopically analyzed for the density of hyphal growth . at dpi gc formed a dense hyphal network with a relatively high number of spore containing conidiophores on wild type leaves . the hyphal network was less dense on _PROTEIN_ leaves but still readily observable . conidiophore formation was almost absent on the _PROTEIN_ mutant . in contrast to wild type and _PROTEIN_ plants gc did not form a hyphal network on _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ leaves . conidia were only able to produce short appressorial germ tubes without further growth . infiltration of the pathogenic bacterium pseudomonas syringae pv tomato induced strong callose deposition in both wild type and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ leaves . comparing callose deposition and d post infiltration we did not observe a difference in the deposited amount of callose or resistance . infiltration of the buffer solution and water only was sufficient to induce callose deposition in _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ leaves but not in wild type or _PROTEIN_ leaves . similar to water infiltration the spraying of water on the leaves induced rapid callose deposition in epidermal cells of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ leaves . at h after spraying _PROTEIN_ shaped callose deposits that traced the outer rim of the small droplets were detectable . this _PROTEIN_ shaped callose deposition was enhanced by spraying of the elicitor active epitope . derives from flagellin which is the _PROTEIN_ component of bacterial flagellum . neither wild type nor _PROTEIN_ mutant cells showed strong callose deposition h after spraying with water or . during wounding no differences in callose deposition between _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and the wild type were observed . the absence of a hyphal network on _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ leaves indicated that an effective defense response was initiated during early stages of infection with gc . therefore we analyzed the cell wall composition of unchallenged leaves . a detailed determination of the noncellulosic monocarbohydrate composition revealed changes in the cell wall of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ lines in comparison with the wild type . fuc and gal levels were reduced whereas the relative amount of glc increased by almost . before germination powdery mildew conidia release an _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ that most likely contains cell wall degrading enzymes and facilitates host recognition . changes in the host cell wall composition therefore may affect host recognition and subsequent conidial germination . a comparison of the germination rate of the virulent powdery mildew gc on _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ wild type and _PROTEIN_ leaves did not show differences . the germination rate of the nonadapted powdery mildew bgh was slightly reduced on _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ leaves relative to wild type and _PROTEIN_ leaves . we then focused on pathogen induced callose deposition in epidermal leaf cells at and h post inoculation . during gc infection we consistently observed a callose deposit underneath the appressorial germ tube at hpi and two callose deposits at and hpi in both _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and wild type leaves . however the size and shape of the callose deposits were different . at hpi the diameter of the first callose deposit was times larger in _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ plants than in wild type plants . the increase in size reflected a fold higher _METHOD_ intensity emitted by callose adsorbed aniline blue in the deposit and a fold higher total callose synthase activity in _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ leaf tissue relative to the wild type . the increased size of the first callose deposit in the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ leaf tissue was based on an additional field of callose surrounding a central callose core as visualized in a three dimensional surface plot . the observed field of callose was not present in wild type deposits . at hpi the first deposit in the wild type leaf tissue showed a callose deposition pattern similar to that of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ a core with a surrounding field of callose . however this deposit was still reduced in diameter _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . the second callose deposit at the tip of the elongated appressorial germ tube differed significantly in its shape . nearly of all deposits in the wild type leaf had a callose encased penetration peg which was not present in callose deposits in _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ leaves . at hpi the frequency of callose encased penetration pegs further increased to almost and was accompanied by a strong callose accumulation around the peg in wild type leaves . the diameters of wild type and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ secondary callose deposits were comparable . at the same time the diameter of the first callose deposit in wild type leaves was no longer discernible because most of the deposits became diffuse and barely detectable . whereas the first and second callose deposits underwent the described changes between and hpi in wild type plants the size and shape of the callose deposits in the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ lines were characterized by their consistency during these early stages of infection . as expected we did not observe pathogen induced callose deposition in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . the penetration success of gc was examined by the formation of haustoria which are fungal feeding structures . the normally virulent powdery mildew gc was not able to successfully penetrate _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ epidermal cells and to form secondary hyphae . comparing the wild type plant and the _PROTEIN_ mutant the penetration success was not significantly different at hpi as it reached rates of approximately . at hpi penetration success further increased in the wild type plant to approximately but was stable in _PROTEIN_ . this was correlated with the observed secondary hyphae formation which was in the wild type plant and almost in _PROTEIN_ . at hpi with the nonadapted powdery mildew bgh the first callose deposit at the tip of the primary germ tube showed a dense callose core surrounded by a field of callose in transgenic _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ lines . these callose deposits resembled the shape of the gc induced deposits . however the diameter was only one half of that observed during gc infection . during the progression of the bgh infection at and hpi the shape of the first callose deposit did not change but the diameter _PROTEIN_ by . in strong contrast to _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ plants callose was not deposited at the primary germ tube of bgh conidia in wild type epidermal cells . similar to gc infection the increased callose deposition of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ lines at hpi with bgh reflected total callose synthase activity that was four times higher than that of the wild type plant . at hpi the occurrence of a callose deposit at the appressorial germ tube was significantly higher in _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ epidermal leaf cells than in wild type epidermal leaf cells . only wild type secondary callose deposits showed penetration pegs with a frequency of . the shape of the callose deposit changed from an enlarged dot like pattern at hpi to a patch like formation at hpi in wild type leaf tissue . as previously observed during gc infection pathogen induced callose deposition was absent in _PROTEIN_ during bgh infection . in contrast to gc infection the penetration success of bgh was significantly higher in _PROTEIN_ than in wild type plants at hpi . to analyze the regulation of pathogen induced callose synthesis we determined _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in wild type and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ leaf tissue . the general _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ level in unchallenged leaf tissue was approximately times higher in _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ tissue than in wild type tissue . during gc infection we determined only a slight increase in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was fold higher in _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ at hpi and in wild type tissues at hpi . during bgh infection the increase in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was even weaker and occurred _PROTEIN_ . the c terminal fusion of _METHOD_ to the callose synthase _PROTEIN_ facilitated the localization of the protein by confocal laser scanning microscopy . in unchallenged _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ leaves we detected _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ at the plant _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ which was labeled with the _LOCATION_ stain fm in epidermal cells . _METHOD_ based _METHOD_ was not detected in wild type leaves . at hpi with gc _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ focally accumulated in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ underneath the appressorial germ tube at sites of attempted fungal penetration . here _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ coincided with localized callose deposition . this area was surrounded by fm labeled bodies which were free from aniline blue signals but may have contained pmr _METHOD_ as indicated in colocalization studies . because hyperactivation of the salicylic acid pathway induces resistance in the _PROTEIN_ mutant we wanted to know whether this plant defense response also contributes to the observed complete powdery mildew resistance in _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ plants . we measured the gene _PROTEIN_ of isochorismate _PROTEIN_ and enhanced disease _PROTEIN_ which are both genetic markers of salicylic acid synthesis in arabidopsis via quantitative pcr during gc and bgh infection . in accordance with the results from citation the absolute transcript levels of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in control _PROTEIN_ leaves were approximately twice as high as those in wild type and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ leaves . during gc infection _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ continuously increased in _PROTEIN_ leaves . in wild type leaves _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was significantly higher only at hpi . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was significantly induced at hpi and remained at this level at and hpi . during bgh infection of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was similar to gc induced _PROTEIN_ as it showed a continuous increase . _PROTEIN_ reached its highest _PROTEIN_ level at hpi . in bgh infected wild type leaves _PROTEIN_ but not _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was significantly higher than in control tissue at and hpi . subsequently _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was significantly repressed at hpi . the transcriptional repression of salicylic acid related genes in wild type leaves was negatively correlated to a strong increase in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ gene is responsive to jasmonate formation . jasmonate is involved in plant defense responses in incompatible plant microbe interactions . in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ during bgh infection but was not altered during gc infection . the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ did not change during gc or bgh infection of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ leaves .
