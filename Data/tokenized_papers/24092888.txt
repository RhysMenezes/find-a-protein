the function of a putative galacturonosyltransferase from arabidopsis was studied using a combination of molecular genetic chemical and immunological approaches . is _PROTEIN_ in all plant tissues with highest _PROTEIN_ levels in siliques _PROTEIN_ . furthermore its _PROTEIN_ is positively regulated by several transcription _PROTEIN_ that are known to regulate seed coat mucilage production . is localized in both _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ in comparison with marker proteins resident to these subcellular compartments . a transfer dna insertion in the gene generates seed coat epidermal cell defects both in mucilage synthesis and cell adhesion . transformation of mutants with the wild type gene results in the complementation of all morphological phenotypes . compositional analyses of the mucilage isolated from the mutant demonstrated that galacturonic acid and rhamnose contents are _PROTEIN_ significantly in compared with wild type mucilage . no changes in structure were observed between soluble mucilage isolated from wild type and mutant seeds except that the molecular weight of the mutant mucilage increased compared with that of the wild type . these data provide evidence that might function in the regulation of the final size of the mucilage rhamnogalacturonan i .
encodes a putative _PROTEIN_ that belongs in the _PROTEIN_ subclade of the _PROTEIN_ family . the coding region of consists of a single exon encoding a protein with a predicted molecular _METHOD_ of kd . like all other atgatl proteins the catalytic domain of the protein contains a dxdxxxxxd motif which is thought to be involved in nucleotide sugar binding and also contains several conserved motifs characteristic of family _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . analysis of the protein sequence using the program for the prediction of transmembrane helices in proteins predicts that has no transmembrane domain suggesting that the protein is not an integral _LOCATION_ protein . to determine the actual subcellular localization of the gene was fused in frame at the c terminus with _METHOD_ and transformed into wild type arabidopsis plants . transgenic arabidopsis plants exhibited both punctate and network like _METHOD_ signals in the cytoplasm of root epidermal cells indicating that is located in subcellular organelles . this construct also has been used to complement the reduced mucilage phenotype of the mutant demonstrating that the fusion protein retains functionality . to further explore the subcellular localization of pro _METHOD_ was cotransformed into nicotiana benthamiana leaf epidermal cells with genes encoding either gmct _METHOD_ an enhanced cyan _METHOD_ protein tagged _LOCATION_ marker or _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ hdel an _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ marker . as shown in figure d to i enhanced yellow _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ tagged colocalizes well with both marker proteins indicating that the protein localizes to both _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ . our previous promoter gus _PROTEIN_ studies showed that the gene is _PROTEIN_ ubiquitously in all the major tissues examined in arabidopsis . according to the atgenexpress visualization tool the highest level of _PROTEIN_ was found during seed development specifically in the heart to torpedo stages of embryo development . in addition data available from transcriptome analyses using rna extracted from laser capture dissected seed coat tissue indicate that transcript levels are low in the seed coat during early embryogenesis and that the levels rise from the linear cotyledon stage onward . we performed in situ hybridization to determine the specific cell type in the seed in which is _PROTEIN_ . the results demonstrate that _PROTEIN_ is confined exclusively to the epidermal cell layer of the outer integument . quantitative real time pcr was performed using rna extracted from developing wild type siliques at and _PROTEIN_ . is up regulated approximately times at _PROTEIN_ corresponding to seeds with _PROTEIN_ heart to torpedo stage embryos when mucilage production in seed coats is at its peak compared with _PROTEIN_ seeds when mucilage synthesis has not yet been initiated . this _PROTEIN_ pattern is consistent with a role for in mucilage synthesis . two independent transfer dna insertion lines and were selected and screened for disruption of the gene using pcr . as shown in figure has a t dna inserted in the exon of whereas the mutant carries a t dna insertion in the untranslated region . plants homozygous for t dna insertions in obtained from the independent insertion lines and were named and respectively . the effect of the t dna insertions on mrna _PROTEIN_ levels was studied by reverse transcription pcr amplification using primers spanning the coding region of the mrna . no amplification was observed in the mutant whereas a clear band corresponding to the amplification of mrna was visible in and wild type plants . the phenotypes described in this article have been observed only in plants but not in plants . when mature hydrated seeds were stained with ruthenium red which stains negatively charged biopolymers such as pectin and dna only a thin irregular staining pattern was observed in seeds whereas wild type seeds showed intense regular spherical staining . further studies were carried out on sections prepared from seeds that were stained with toluidine blue o a polychromatic dye that stains mucilage pink . significant pink staining mucilage was seen in the epidermal cells of both mutant and wild type seeds after the completion of mucilage synthesis _PROTEIN_ . to further analyze the defects present in the seed coat seeds of the wild type and were observed by scanning electron microscopy . as shown in figure g h j and k the central volcano shaped columella in seed coat epidermal cells is broader than that in wild type seeds in agreement with the reduced amount of mucilage . these results were confirmed by calcofluor white staining of arabidopsis seeds which brightly stains the columella and the hexagonal walls of epidermal cells and also shows that mucilage secretory cells have a wider columella than wild type secretory cells . the increased width of the columella is consistent with the phenotype seen in other mutants with severely _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and moderately reduced mucilage production . besides the mucilage defect and changes in mucilage secretory cell structure the mutant also shows less adhesion between the hexagonal seed coat epidermal cell walls and wild type seeds as evidenced by the appearance of two distinct walls side by side in some areas of the seed coat rather than a single _PROTEIN_ wall as seen for wild type cells in either the scanning electron microscopy images or in the calcofluor white stained seeds . immunogold labeling using ccrc was employed to visualize the localization of hg epitopes in seed coat epidermal cells . nonmethylesterified hg is evenly distributed in the middle lamella and cell corners of seed coat epidermal cells . labeling is also observed in clumps within the apoplastic space interior to the cell wall of seed coat epidermal cells which is where the mucilage is deposited . less labeling was observed in both areas in seeds compared with the wild type and with the complemented seeds . homozygous mutant plants are morphologically indistinguishable from wild type plants throughout development and reached similar sizes in their aboveground growth . no significant differences in root growth were observed when and wild type seeds were germinated on vertical agar plates . complementation of the mutant with a wild type copy of the gene was undertaken in order to verify that the mutant phenotypes result from the knockout of the gene . an exogenous copy of the gene driven by its native promoter was transformed into mutants . twelve independent transformants were examined and all showed the same characteristics . representative results are shown in figures c f i l and o c and f and supplemental figure c f and i and demonstrate that transformation of the gene into restored all observed mutant phenotypes to the wild type . these experiments show that the phenotypes observed in are the result of the mutation in the gene . arabidopsis seed mucilage has two layers . the outer layer is water soluble and is easily extracted using either water or ammonium oxalate . the inner layer is strongly attached to the seed and can not be removed with either hot acid or alkali . the sugar composition of the water extractable outer layer showed a reduction in the amounts of gala and rha but no change in the molar ratios of these two sugars in the mutant mucilage compared with the wild type . in order to obtain a more complete picture of total mucilage composition rhamnogalacturonan hydrolase treatment was used to solubilize both layers of mucilage from and wild type seeds and the monosaccharide compositions of the released materials were analyzed . rhamnogalacturonan hydrolase cleaves unbranched rg i to oligomers with rha at the nonreducing end and ruthenium red staining of the extracted seeds showed that compared with water or ammonium oxalate extraction rhamnogalacturonan hydrolase removes the mucilage more extensively than does water . although some cell wall components from the seed coat or the embryo might also be released compositional analysis of the enzyme released mucilage best represents the composition of the total seed mucilage as the molar ratio of rha and gala is close to . the total amount of sugar released by the enzyme treatment was reduced approximately in seeds compared with wild type seeds . most of this decline in total sugar released from mutant seed is accounted for by _PROTEIN_ in the amounts of gala and rha released compared with the wild type . other monosaccharides including ara fuc xyl man gal and glc only account for a few percent of the total monosaccharides released and did not change appreciably in . in the wild type and the mutant the water soluble mucilage fraction accounts for around of the total mucilage the other is strongly attached to the seed coat . transformation of the mutant with a wild type copy of the gene rescued the reduced gala and rha to wild type levels . these results suggest that the amount of rg i which is the major component of mucilage synthesized by seeds is significantly reduced . this is in agreement with microscopic observations that indicated that the mutant testa epidermal cells release lower quantities of mucilage as measured by staining with ruthenium red . the amounts of sugar are presented as mean values se of three independent samples . significance was tested by the mann whitney u test comparing with the wild type . to investigate the structure of seed mucilage in the wild type and the mutant in greater detail glycosyl linkage analysis was performed on the soluble polysaccharides extracted from wild type and seed mucilage without enzyme treatment . consistent with previous studies the predominant linkages in the mucilage of both the wild type and are linked rha and linked gala both of these linkages _PROTEIN_ slightly in mucilage compared with the wild type . consistent with the monosaccharide analysis data in table i no detectable changes in the glycosyl linkage composition of other sugars were found in mucilage . these finding suggest that the reduced mucilage content in seeds is not associated with major changes in rg i structure . values are means of two samples with variance less than . results are given as mol . tr trace amounts less than . all sugar associated peaks in the chromatogram are accounted for by these data . the glycosyl composition and linkage composition analyses suggest that only the amount of rg i is reduced in the mutant mucilage . to further examine whether the structural features of the mutant mucilage are altered or not over antibodies that recognize most major classes of cell wall polysaccharides including pectins hemicelluloses galactans and arabinogalactans were employed to probe the mutant mucilage by elisa . as shown in supplemental figure a total of antibodies that recognize epitopes on hg rg i and arabinogalactan bind strongly to mucilage . no significant differences in binding were observed between wild type and mucilage for any of the antibodies tested indicating that the diverse epitopes recognized by these antibodies are not altered in the mutant mucilage . these immunological observations further support the conclusion drawn from the compositional and linkage analyses above that the mucilage has not undergone a major change in polysaccharide structure at least with respect to composition . the data presented above have clearly shown that the mutation leads to a discernible reduction in the amount of seed mucilage produced yet no alterations in mucilage structure could be detected . we then determined whether the size of the mucilage was affected by the mutation . the water soluble mucilage was analyzed by high performance size exclusion chromatography _PROTEIN_ combined with multiple angle laser light scattering . the elution profiles indicate that most large mr polysaccharides in the seed mucilage preparation elute at to min after injection . the detection of the elution profile by both the light scattering and refractive index concentration detectors is nearly superimposable . from the refractive index detector there are _PROTEIN_ eluting smaller mr materials . most likely these correspond to small sugars ions or pigments since there was no corresponding signal from the light scattering detector and the extracts separated by hp _PROTEIN_ were not dialyzed prior to analysis . the macromolecular characteristics of the mucilage are listed in table iii . wild type and complemented mucilage polysaccharides have an average molecular _METHOD_ of and kd respectively . in contrast the mucilage has a molecular _METHOD_ of kd which is significantly larger than that of wild type and complemented mucilages . mn number average molar _METHOD_ mw weight average mr mw/mn polydispersity coefficient rw root mean square radius . results are averages of three biological replicates . significance was tested by the mann whitney u test comparing with the wild type . belongs to _PROTEIN_ active enzymes family _PROTEIN_ several of whose members have been implicated in the synthesis of hg including one functionally characterized galat _PROTEIN_ . thus we tested whether functions as a hg galat . microsomal _LOCATION_ prepared from n. benthamiana leaves transiently _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were used for the hg galat assay . results from two independent experiments revealed no significant differences in the activity measured between the control and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ plants suggesting that does not have a hg galat activity comparable to _PROTEIN_ . a number of transcription _PROTEIN_ have been identified that are associated with mucilage synthesis in the seed coat including _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ and a _PROTEIN_ protein complex which includes _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ positively regulate _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ in turn activates transcription of the rha synthase _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ however appears to regulate mucilage production through an alternative pathway . since _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ appear to act upstream of other regulators _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ microarray analysis was used to identify genes that are regulated by these two transcription _PROTEIN_ . rna isolated from wild type and _PROTEIN_ siliques at _PROTEIN_ was used to probe affymetrix _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . the microarray identified genes that were down regulated in the mutant and genes that were down regulated in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . the genes that are down regulated in both and _PROTEIN_ mutants are listed in table iv . as expected _PROTEIN_ was one of the genes down regulated in both mutants . among those genes coregulated with _PROTEIN_ by _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ is one of the most strongly down regulated genes in both and _PROTEIN_ mutants . quantitative rt pcr analysis showed a marked _PROTEIN_ in and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in and _PROTEIN_ as compared with controls . these results validate our microarray experiments . together they suggest that similar to _PROTEIN_ is up regulated at the time of mucilage synthesis by a pathway that includes both _PROTEIN_ and the _PROTEIN_ transcription _PROTEIN_ complex . fc fold change a value of means no change a fold change of or more means that the _PROTEIN_ of the gene was induced in the mutant versus the wild type _PROTEIN_ a fold change of or less means that the gene was repressed in the mutant versus the wild type . to determine if any of the other known transcription _PROTEIN_ affecting mucilage production are involved in the regulation of we performed quantitative rt pcr using rna extracted from _PROTEIN_ siliques of the wild type and _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants . the level of transcript was reduced dramatically in both _PROTEIN_ and mutant siliques compared with wild type siliques suggesting that in addition to _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are required for maximum levels of _PROTEIN_ at the time of mucilage production . transcript levels were also down regulated slightly in _PROTEIN_ siliques compared with the wild type although not as dramatically as in _PROTEIN_ and siliques . these results suggest that there might be some cross talk between the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ pathways or that may be located near the bottom of the mucilage synthesis pathway where these regulatory pathways converge .
