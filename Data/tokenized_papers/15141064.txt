we developed a high throughput methodology termed _METHOD_ tagging of full length proteins _PROTEIN_ to analyze _PROTEIN_ patterns and subcellular localization of arabidopsis gene products in planta . determination of these parameters is a logical first step in functional characterization of the approximately one third of all known arabidopsis genes that encode novel proteins of unknown function . our _PROTEIN_ based approach offers two significant advantages first it produces internally tagged full length proteins that are likely to exhibit native intracellular localization and second it yields information about the tissue specificity of gene _PROTEIN_ by the use of native promoters . to demonstrate how _PROTEIN_ may be used for characterization of the arabidopsis proteome we tagged a series of known proteins with diverse subcellular targeting patterns as well as several proteins with unknown function and unassigned subcellular localization .
_METHOD_ tagging of proteins to study their _PROTEIN_ and localization patterns should ideally conform to the following three criteria the _METHOD_ reporter should be stable over the range of physiological conditions found in different subcellular compartments such as ph the insertion of the reporter should minimally disturb the conformation of the target protein and preserve native targeting signals and posttranslational modification sites and _PROTEIN_ of the tagged protein should occur from its native regulatory sequences to faithfully detect its developmental and/or tissue specific regulation . our _PROTEIN_ approach fulfills these three requirements . as a _METHOD_ tag we used the citrine variant of yellow _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ which can be used not only to visualize a single protein but also to study protein protein interactions in vivo as an energy acceptor in bioluminescence resonance energy transfer and _METHOD_ resonance energy transfer assays . citrine _METHOD_ has enhanced photostability and is much less sensitive to ph and anions such as chloride compared to other _METHOD_ variants . the reduced sensitivity to ph allows detection of proteins targeted to the _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ or to other relatively acidic subcellular compartments making it more suitable for tagging proteins with a wide range of targeting specificities . some proteins were also tagged with cyan _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ for comparison of localization patterns obtained with different tags and for future colocalization and protein interaction studies . methods and results for _METHOD_ were identical to those for _METHOD_ . we flanked the _METHOD_ open reading frame with flexible linker peptides minimizing protein folding interference between _METHOD_ and the tagged arabidopsis protein . to avoid placing identical nucleotide sequences on each side of the tag we used two different linkers the n terminus of _METHOD_ was linked to a gly rich peptide and the c terminus is linked to an ala rich linker peptide alagly . to further avoid effects of the _METHOD_ tag on native subcellular localization the location of the tag relative to the target sequence was determined for each individual protein based on computer assisted predictions of protein folding and functional domains . we reasoned that it should be possible to devise a default tag location for most target proteins . the tag should ideally reside within a stretch of hydrophilic residues outside of any specific protein domain and near the c terminus . thus our default strategy was to insert the _METHOD_ tag bp upstream of the stop codon . this location minimizes disturbance of the contiguous protein sequence and protects the activity of _LOCATION_ anchoring signals typically found within a few c terminal amino acid residues . indeed the addition of a four amino acid farnesylation motif to the c terminus of _METHOD_ is sufficient to direct it to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and fusion of a tripeptide peroxisomal targeting signal to the c terminus of a reporter protein also allows specific localization . in cases where the default tag position overlapped with a predicted protein domain an alternative tag site near the c terminus was selected to meet our criteria of being within a hydrophilic region and not disrupting any predicted domain . over of the genes we tested had suitable primers within the last amino acid residues from the c terminus . to faithfully reproduce the _PROTEIN_ level and pattern of each target gene our constructs included the utr and promoter sequences the coding region with introns and the utr and downstream sequence . most intergenic distances in the arabidopsis genome are around kb suggesting that the promoter sequences are contained in a relatively small region . thus we included up to kb upstream of the translation initiation codon and kb downstream of the _PROTEIN_ codon in our constructs . we designed an efficient protocol for generation and in planta _PROTEIN_ of tagged genes . we first amplified the selected gene in two fragments one from the predicted start of the promoter to the _METHOD_ insertion site and the second comprising the rest of the coding sequence and . in addition to gene specific sequences primers and were tailed with sequences complementary to the gateway primers and and were tailed with sequences complementary to the _METHOD_ linkers . we also amplified the _METHOD_ coding sequence with flanking linkers . in a second round of pcr all three amplified fragments acted as overlapping templates for long flanking homology pcr . this reaction which we called triple template pcr used two common primers tailed with the and gateway sequences and complementary at their end to the and primers . thus tt pcr introduced the _METHOD_ tag into the selected site within the target gene without the need for conventional cloning and created an internally tagged full length gene ready for gateway recombination cloning . for stable _PROTEIN_ in transgenic plants each _METHOD_ tagged gene was cloned and transferred into an agrobacterium binary vector . for high throughput we used the gateway system which is based on bacteriophage site specific recombination . the gateway cloning first produced a donor construct containing the amplified tt pcr product in the donor vector . the tagged gene was next recombined in vitro into the destination vector . a binary destination vector was constructed by subcloning the gateway conversion cassette into the promoter less t dna region of resulting in the pbin gw vector . to augment native _PROTEIN_ of genes with relatively weak promoters we also constructed a binary destination vector with tetramerized camv enhancers in the t dna region of resulting in pmn gw . in our experiments the efficiency of the first recombination reaction into the donor plasmid was to whereas recombination into the binary destination vector was efficient . following recombination into the donor vector we completely sequenced all tagged gene clones to estimate the rate of sequence _LOCATION_ introduced by pcr . each amplified gene carried between zero and three amino acid substitutions corresponding to average amino acid substitution rate of to kb of amplified sequence . additional details and step by step experimental protocols for _PROTEIN_ can be found on our web site http _METHOD_ . as proof of concept for the _PROTEIN_ approach we _METHOD_ tagged a number of arabidopsis genes whose protein products have diverse known subcellular locations such as the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ . transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ these genes were produced by agrobacterium mediated transformation and examined for _PROTEIN_ of the tagged transgenes in various plant organs such as roots hypocotyls and cotyledons . on average to primary transgenic plants were screened per construct using a _METHOD_ dissecting microscope followed by detailed analysis by confocal laser scanning microscopy . in most cases to of plants exhibited _METHOD_ protein _PROTEIN_ . in the following sections we describe selected examples of patterns of subcellular localization and _PROTEIN_ of known proteins as well as several proteins with unknown function and unassigned subcellular localization . localization to _LOCATION_ was exemplified by two arabidopsis proteins the multifunctional protein _METHOD_ and peroxisomal targeting signal type receptor _PROTEIN_ . the corresponding genes were tagged with _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ from their native promoters with and without the enhancers . _PROTEIN_ was examined by confocal laser scanning microscopy in hypocotyls leaves and roots . in all these organs _METHOD_ localized to discrete subcellular structures that represent _LOCATION_ . while the enhancers clearly increased the levels of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ they did not alter its subcellular localization . similar _PROTEIN_ patterns were obtained with _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ . to demonstrate that the fidelity of subcellular targeting was not limited to protein tagging with _METHOD_ we also tagged _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ with _METHOD_ . figure illustrates that the _METHOD_ tagged _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ exhibited peroxisomal targeting identical to that of _METHOD_ tagged _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ in different plant tissues such as cotyledons hypocotyls leaves and roots . the _METHOD_ tagged genes also showed higher levels of _PROTEIN_ but the same subcellular targeting specificities in the presence of the enhancers . tonoplast _LOCATION_ targeting was examined using delta tonoplast intrinsic protein _PROTEIN_ an arabidopsis tonoplast protein and a homolog of aquaporins found in _LOCATION_ of storage _LOCATION_ in pea and barley . figure shows that _METHOD_ tagged delta _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ in hypocotyls leaves and roots and localized exclusively to the tonoplast _LOCATION_ . the use of a _METHOD_ tag or of the enhancers did not affect the subcellular localization of delta _PROTEIN_ but the enhancers slightly elevated its _PROTEIN_ level . in addition _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ signal was observed in bulb like structures previously reported to associate with the tonoplast _LOCATION_ and to contain another tonoplast protein gamma _PROTEIN_ . _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ intrinsic protein _PROTEIN_ of arabidopsis a channel protein was used to visualize protein targeting to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ from its native promoter in the absence or in the presence of enhancers localized exclusively at the extreme cell periphery in all plant tissues including hypocotyls cotyledons and roots . this localization pattern could be interpreted as either _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ or _LOCATION_ because the cytoplasm is typically displaced to the cell periphery by the large central _LOCATION_ . however the _LOCATION_ compartment is characterized by transvacuolar strands variations in _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ at the cell cortex and rapid remodeling over time due to _LOCATION_ streaming . the absence of these patterns together with the uniform and sharp pattern of peripheral labeling by _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ indicates that the localization was in _PROTEIN_ at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . we also distinguished _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ targeting from cell wall localization by plasmolysis experiments where the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signal associated with the displaced _LOCATION_ in plasmolysed cells . proline rich protein _PROTEIN_ resides in the cell wall . this specific subcellular localization was faithfully reproduced using the _PROTEIN_ gene tagged with _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ with enhancers in hypocotyls cotyledons and roots . the cell wall localization of the _METHOD_ signal remained after plasmolysis and was also observed using the _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ with and without enhancers . plasmodesmata play essential roles in cell to cell transport and communication . however little is known about the proteins comprising these channels which connect cells and regulate traffic of molecules as large as viral genomes . because native plasmodesmal proteins have not been definitively identified we used a plant viral protein the cell to cell movement protein of turnip vein clearing virus _PROTEIN_ as a plasmodesmal marker . viral cell to cell movement proteins _PROTEIN_ target to plasmodesmata and represent a classical tool in studies of plasmodesmal transport . thus we tagged tvcv _PROTEIN_ with _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ it from the full promoter . figure shows the characteristic punctate pattern of the tagged protein _PROTEIN_ in root tissues and accumulated at the cell periphery presumably in the cell wall . previously such puncta have been shown to represent plasmodesmal accumulation of _PROTEIN_ . arabidopsis fimbrin _PROTEIN_ cross links filamentous actin producing a fine reticulate network of filaments .we observed evidence of fine filaments of _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ around chloroplasts in leaf mesophyll cells . the _METHOD_ signal was stronger in plants with the enhancers constructs but the localization pattern was unchanged . treatment with latrunculin a a drug that disrupts actin filaments resulted in disruption of the filaments supporting the conclusion that the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was associated with actin . the pattern of _PROTEIN_ localization in green tissues was remarkably similar to that observed with another filamentous actin binding protein _PROTEIN_ which is thought to participate in chloroplast positioning . arabidopsis _METHOD_ associated _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ preferentially localizes to the _LOCATION_ envelope and to proplastids . _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ exactly reproduced this subcellular localization pattern in roots and leaves accumulating in a distinct perinuclear _PROTEIN_ as well as associating with proplastid like structures . again _PROTEIN_ from the construct with enhancers did not alter the subcellular targeting of the protein . interacting protein _PROTEIN_ of arabidopsis is homologous to yeast and drosophila rga proteins which are thought to mediate intranuclear interactions between chromatin proteins and the transcriptional complex . indeed gus fusions to _PROTEIN_ accumulate in the _LOCATION_ of tobacco and arabidopsis cells . here our analysis of transgenic arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ confirmed the _LOCATION_ targeting of this protein . virtually no signal was detected in the cytoplasm indicating efficient _LOCATION_ import . indeed because the predicted size of the citrine _PROTEIN_ fusion protein is substantially larger than the size exclusion limit of the _LOCATION_ pore its accumulation within the _LOCATION_ must result from the active process of _LOCATION_ import . the _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ gene had an intriguing cell specific pattern of _PROTEIN_ . figure shows that the tagged protein was detected only in megasporocytes and tapetum cells but it was not detected in seedling roots leaves or hypocotyls . this specificity of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was confirmed by reverse transcription pcr which detected _PROTEIN_ transcripts in the flower buds and mature flowers but not in roots leaves or _METHOD_ of wild type arabidopsis . in control experiments analysis of actin specific transcripts generated similar amounts of pcr products in all samples indicating equal efficiencies of the rt pcr reactions . thus transgenic _PROTEIN_ of the _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ revealed novel information about the native cell specific _PROTEIN_ pattern of this gene as well as subcellular localization of its protein product . another example of an arabidopsis _LOCATION_ protein is the interacting protein _PROTEIN_ a basic leu zipper protein thought to function in transcriptional complexes and during agrobacterium infection facilitate _LOCATION_ import of . _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ exhibited exclusively _LOCATION_ localization in roots leaves and stigmatic papillae of the transgenic plants . these _LOCATION_ patterns of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ subcellular localization remained unchanged when the proteins were _PROTEIN_ from the enhancer containing construct . recent data suggest that of the yeast proteins are _LOCATION_ . similarly many plant proteins may be cytoplasmic . to illustrate the patterns expected from cytoplasmic localization we used the _LOCATION_ gln synthetase of arabidopsis . figure shows the characteristic cytoplasmic pattern with transvacuolar strands that _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ tagged _METHOD_ in leaf and root cells . in this case the use of the enhancers construct did not significantly alter _METHOD_ levels and it had no effect on the _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ accumulation in roots or leaves . to examine whether this tagged gene showed its known transcriptional regulation we germinated the seedlings in light or in the dark . the _METHOD_ tagged exhibited the expected light induced _PROTEIN_ in the roots of transgenic plants . more than one third of arabidopsis genes have no predicted function . we propose that our _PROTEIN_ approach combined with the standardized image interpretation can be used to characterize arabidopsis proteins whose function is unknown and whose intracellular localization can not be predicted based on their amino acid sequence . the following genes of unknown function were randomly selected for these experiments and tagged with _METHOD_ _GENE_ _GENE_ _GENE_ _GENE_ and _GENE_ . the tagged proteins were _PROTEIN_ in transgenic plants from their native promoters and the subcellular localization patterns were compared to those of our reference genes . figure shows that _GENE_ augmented with enhancers was _PROTEIN_ predominantly in root tissues especially in _PROTEIN_ root primordia . the tagged protein exhibited perinuclear localization remarkably similar to that of _PROTEIN_ . some of the tagged protein also accumulated at the cell periphery in the cytoplasm . native _PROTEIN_ of was observed _PROTEIN_ in guard cells in the cytoplasm and in unidentified subcellular structures . _GENE_ was _PROTEIN_ in the root and accumulated in the cytoplasm but was not detected in other organs . _GENE_ was _PROTEIN_ specifically in the root tip _PROTEIN_ and was cytoplasmic . finally _GENE_ was exclusively _LOCATION_ in the leaf and in petioles .
the plasmid was digested with ecori and hindiii and the ends were filled in with klenow . into these blunted ends we ligated a blunt ended gateway conversion cassette . the resulting gateway destination vector designated pbin gw has the following structure in its t dna region t dna right border nos terminator < nptii < promoter > cat > ccdb > t dna left border . this vector has no regulatory sequences for _PROTEIN_ of cloned genes and thus is useful for producing native levels and patterns of gene _PROTEIN_ . using a similar strategy the activation tagging plasmid was converted to a gateway vector following digestion with hindiii . the resulting plasmid pmn gw has the following structure of its t dna region t dna right border > cat > ccdb > promoter nptii nos terminator t dna left border . this vector has tetramerized camv enhancers in its t dna region and thus is useful for producing elevated levels of gene _PROTEIN_ while retaining native _PROTEIN_ patterns . note that based vectors should be prepared from fresh bacterial stocks and used immediately after transferring them to agrobacterium because they tend to lose some copies of their enhancers due to recombination in escherichia coli or agrobacterium when stored at . both pbin gw and pmn gw vectors were propagated in the strain of e. coli strain carrying the _PROTEIN_ gene which confers resistance to the toxicity of the ccdb gene _PROTEIN_ . following gateway recombination ccdb is replaced by the _METHOD_ tagged gene allowing better selection for the recombinant clones in bacterial strains that do not carry _PROTEIN_ or f episome . _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ tags were amplified from the prsetb citrine and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ plasmids as templates using the extaq dna polymerase and the following pair of primers for both genes forward primer aaggccggcctggaggtggaggtggagctgtgagca and reverse primer _PROTEIN_ . these primers encode peptide linkers and alagly followed by recognition sites for rare cutting endonucleases fsei and sfii respectively . these restriction sites although not required for subsequent gene tagging may be useful in future application for easy replacement of the _METHOD_ by other protein tags . the amplified fragments were subcloned into a ptopo ta vector . using these constructs as templates dna fragments encoding _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ tags with linker sequences were amplified using the pfu turbo dna polymerase and gel purified using the gfx pcr purification kit for their subsequent use in tt pcr . for each gene two sets of primers and were designed by a perl script that takes into account the annealing temperature the position of each primer within the genomic and protein sequence and primer length and secondary structure in an iterative fashion until a suitable pair is detected it uses part of the program . for all unknown genes tigr 's genome release version was used . we obtained interpro functional domain mapping data from tigr and secondary structure mapping from structural classification of proteins . the sequences of the primers are shown in table i . besides to nucleotides long gene specific sequences and primers contained sequences _PROTEIN_ and cgtagcgagaccacagga respectively that partially overlap the gateway primers whereas and primers contained sequences cacagctccacctccacctccaggccggcc and tgctggtgctgctgcggccgctggggcc respectively that partially overlap the _METHOD_ tag linkers . for the first pcr reaction genomic dna was extracted from total leaf material of week old arabidopsis ecotype columbia plants using the dneasy plant mini kit according to the manufacturer 's instructions and used as template . the gene fragments were amplified in of the mixture containing ng template dna extaq reaction buffer mm dntp of each primer and extaq . the following pcr conditions were used cycle at for min touch down cycles at for s for s and for kb of the longest amplified sequence cycles at for s for s and for kb of the longest amplified sequence and cycle at for kb of the longest amplified sequence . the amplified fragments were gel purified using a gfx pcr gel purification kit and the extaq generated a overhangs were removed by incubation for min at in containing amplified dna reaction buffer mm dntp and pfu polymerase . tagged arabidopsis genes with known targeting specificities and sequences of dna primers used for their amplification for the second pcr reaction a pair of standard gene nonspecific gateway primers were designed . the forward primer ggggacaagtttgtacaaaaaagcaggctgctcgatccacctaggct contained the sequence and the reverse primer ggggaccactttgtacaagaaagctgggtcgtagcgagaccacagga contained the sequence . these primers were combined with three templates i.e . the _METHOD_ tag and two gene fragments in of a mixture containing ng long fragment ng short fragment ng _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ fragment extaq reaction buffer mm dntp of each gateway primer and extaq . tt pcr was performed under the following conditions cycle at for min cycles at for s for s and for kb of the longest amplified sequence and cycle at for kb of the longest amplified sequence . the tt pcr product was gel purified as described above and recombined into the gateway donor vector in _PROTEIN_ clonase reaction containing ng tt pcr fragment ng _PROTEIN_ clonase and _PROTEIN_ clonase buffer . following overnight incubation at proteinase k was added and the incubation continued for min at after which to of the reaction mixture was transformed into the or strain of e. coli and the recombinants were selected on a gentamycin containing medium . clones with the correct inserts were identified by colony pcr using a pair of vector specific attl primers i.e . forward primer tcgcgttaacgctagcatggatctc and reverse primer _PROTEIN_ . finally the tagged genes were transferred from their donor constructs to both of the binary destination vectors pbin gw and pmn gw in of a single lr clonase reaction containing to ng donor construct ng pbin gw and pmn gw units topoisomerase lr clonase and lr clonase buffer . after overnight incubation at of proteinase k was added and the incubation continued for min at following which of the reaction mixture was transformed into the or strain of e. coli and the pbin gw and pmn gw recombinants were selected on a kanamycin or spectinomycin containing medium respectively note that different antibiotic resistance markers of pbin gw and pmn gw allow simultaneous recombination of the tagged genes into both of these binary vectors in the same reaction mixture . the correct clones were identified by colony pcr using and primers . all gene amplification reactions were performed using extaq dna polymerase and the amplification products were verified by dna sequencing . the binary constructs were introduced into the a. tumefaciens strain and the resulting bacterial cultures were used to transform arabidopsis ecotype columbia by the standard flower dip method or its modified version . seed stocks for all transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ the tagged proteins described in this study are available from the arabidopsis biological resource center _PROTEIN_ . live seedlings and plant tissue samples were mounted in water between number coverglasses using silicon vacuum grease to create spacers between the glass surfaces . images were collected with one of three laser scanning confocal microscope _METHOD_ a leica tcs a zeiss lsm pascal or a bio rad mrc . in all cases a high numerical aperture water immersion objective was employed . a nm or a nm laser line from an argon ion was used to excited _METHOD_ and a nm line from a hecd laser or a nm line from an argon ion laser was used to excite _METHOD_ . total rna was extracted from g of roots leaves _METHOD_ flower buds and mature flowers of wild type arabidopsis using _PROTEIN_ reagent and reverse transcribed with m mulv reverse transcriptase using the primer . the resulting first strand cdnas were pcr amplified as described using a mixture of forward and reverse primers derived from _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ actin _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . rt pcr products were then detected by ethidium bromide staining of agarose gels . _PROTEIN_ forward and reverse primers aaacatggttggtggaggtaactt and ggagacgcaaatgtcttgtagaga respectively generated a bp product while actin forward and reverse primers accttgctggtcgtgacctt and _PROTEIN_ respectively generated a bp product . sequence data from this article have been deposited with the embl/genbank data libraries under
