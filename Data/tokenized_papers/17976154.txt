amongst the nine voltage gated k channel subunits _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ does not seem to form functional kv channels on its own and is therefore said to be silent . it has been proposed to be a regulatory subunit and to significantly influence the functional properties of heteromeric channels in which it participates along with other kv channel subunits . the _METHOD_ underlying these properties of _PROTEIN_ remain unknown . here the transient _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and/or _PROTEIN_ genes was obtained in tobacco mesophyll protoplasts which lack endogenous inward kv channel activity . our experimental conditions allowed both localization of _PROTEIN_ polypeptides _METHOD_ and recording of heterologously _PROTEIN_ kv channel activity . it is shown that _PROTEIN_ remains in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ unless it is co _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ . in these conditions heteromeric _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ channels are obtained and display functional properties different from those of homomeric _PROTEIN_ channels in the same context . in particular the activation threshold voltage of the former channels is more negative than that of the latter ones . also it is proposed that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ heterodimers are preferred to _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ homodimers during the process of tetramer assembly . similar results are obtained upon co _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ . the whole set of data provides evidence that _PROTEIN_ is a conditionally targeted kv subunit which probably downregulates the physiological activity of other kv channel subunits in arabidopsis .
when _PROTEIN_ alone in tobacco mesophyll protoplasts the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion was retained in the _LOCATION_ whereas in parallel experiments the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion was targeted to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ as indicated by the co localization of staining . interestingly when the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion was co _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ the _METHOD_ shifted to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . this suggested that some interaction between the two shaker channel subunits _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ occurred and enabled the latter to escape from the _LOCATION_ and to reach the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ probably as a component of heteromeric channels together with _PROTEIN_ . the patch clamp technique was used to study exogenous channel activity resulting from _PROTEIN_ and/or _PROTEIN_ coexpression in tobacco mesophyll protoplasts . when _PROTEIN_ alone _PROTEIN_ did not change the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ conductance _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ protoplasts displayed the same current pattern as control protoplasts transformed with the empty vector i.e . low currents with weak dependence on time and voltage . in the same conditions as previously reported _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ alone formed functional channels enabling large time and voltage dependent currents to flow through the protoplast _LOCATION_ upon hyperpolarization characterized by a voltage threshold close to mv . a variable feature displayed by the corresponding protoplasts was the current amplitude probably resulting from differences in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ level from one transformed protoplast to another . all the protoplasts _PROTEIN_ both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ displayed time and voltage dependent currents but in most cases the activation voltage threshold of these currents was more negative than mv . this voltage threshold was obtained as follows . in each _PROTEIN_ co _PROTEIN_ protoplast and for each imposed voltage we checked whether the recorded current was significantly larger than the endogenous current recorded in control protoplasts at the same voltage . stepping from mv with a mv _PROTEIN_ the first voltage step for which this occurred was taken as the threshold for activation of the exogenous current . activation voltage thresholds were thus estimated to within mv and with respect to this _PROTEIN_ co _PROTEIN_ protoplasts could be sorted into three categories corresponding to threshold values of mv mv and mv respectively . average current voltage curves with the different observed voltage thresholds are shown in figure . these different voltage thresholds for current activation corresponded to actual changes in the voltage dependence of the current as evidenced by g/gmax analyses . if _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ subunits are able to assemble in heteromeric channels several combinations are possible a priori . therefore in protoplasts co _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ the data probably reflect the activity of different types of heterotetramers rather than that of a homogenous population of a single type of channel . thus in such _METHOD_ the parameters shaping the boltzmann gating curves shown in figure are purely operational but can not be ascribed to a given type of channel . in contrast the voltage threshold for the whole cell current activation indicates that channels gating below this threshold are numerous enough to yield measurable macroscopic currents and that channels gating from a higher threshold were absent or few in number i.e . not detectable . as a consequence of these drastic changes in voltage dependence no exogenous outward hyperpolarization activated and time dependent k currents were recorded in mm external k in _PROTEIN_ co transformed protoplasts displaying mv or mv voltage thresholds . such outward currents were recorded however in the _PROTEIN_ transformed protoplasts . depending on which subunits were _PROTEIN_ the occurrence of the current patterns varied as is summarized in figure . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ protoplasts displayed a single current pattern no voltage threshold and mv voltage threshold respectively . thus none of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ protoplasts displayed time and voltage dependent currents and all the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ protoplasts displayed such currents below a threshold in the mv range . _PROTEIN_ co _PROTEIN_ protoplasts displayed one of the mv mv and mv voltage threshold current patterns the first one being the less frequently observed . we also investigated whether _PROTEIN_ was able to interact with and to change the channel activity of a kv subunit other than _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ has been found to interact with the c terminal part of _PROTEIN_ in two hybrid experiments . therefore _PROTEIN_ was co _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ in tobacco protoplasts and the resulting heterologous channel activity was compared with the one resulting from the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ alone in the same context . the results indicate that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ subunits are able to form heteromeric channels with negatively shifted activation voltages when compared with homomeric _PROTEIN_ channels .
analyses of channel subcellular localization and electrophysiological activity were carried out using transiently transformed tobacco leaf mesophyll protoplasts as described previously . the protoplasts were incubated for h at after transformation . subcellular localizations of channel _METHOD_ marker constructs and of labelling were performed using a zeiss confocal microscope _PROTEIN_ . electrophysiological analyses were carried out in parallel using protoplasts from the same batch but transformed using vectors allowing co _PROTEIN_ of one of the two channel subunits under investigation with _METHOD_ as a marker of the transformed cells . in this case the _METHOD_ sequence was not fused to the sequence of a channel subunit but was inserted separately in the transforming vector . to measure currents from only transformed protoplasts an _METHOD_ microscope allowing _METHOD_ detection was combined with a patch clamp set up . the _METHOD_ signal was detected between and nm using an emission filter _METHOD_ upon excitation at a wavelength of nm emitted by a monochromator . _METHOD_ positive protoplasts were analyzed for their exogenous inward k conductance . patch clamp pipettes were pulled from borosilicate capillaries to obtain a pipette resistance of about in the solutions used . electrophysiological analyses were performed only when seals with resistances higher than were obtained . whole cell recordings were made using an axopatch amplifier . the pclamp software was used for voltage pulse stimulation online data acquisition and data analysis . the standard protocol consisted of stepping the _LOCATION_ potential in mv _PROTEIN_ to voltages from to mv from a holding potential of mv . in some cases an offset of or mv was set on the amplifier to shift the accessible voltage range to mv or mv . the pipette solution contained mm mm egta mm mm k glutamate mm mgatp mm hepes naoh with its osmolarity adjusted to mosm with d mannitol . the perfused bath solution contained mm mm mm k glutamate mm ethanesulphonic acid hcl with the osmolarity adjusted to mosm with d mannitol . the junction potential was corrected but no leak correction was made . g/gmax analysis was made from the steady state value of the time dependent current . the currents recorded in protoplasts co _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ suggested that different kinds of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ heterotetramers were formed . this prompted us to model the assembly of tetramers from a given stock of monomeric _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ subunits _PROTEIN_ to predict the subunit composition of the resulting channels considering a number of assumptions as described in discussion . briefly once a dimer has been drawn its fate was as follows any _PROTEIN_ dimer was disassembled _PROTEIN_ an _PROTEIN_ homodimer _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was either kept for subsequent assembly of tetramers with an x probability or was disassembled with a x probability . disassembled dimers yielded monomers available for new pairing . in the preference for homodimers case x was times y . in the random assembly case x was equal to y . in the preference for heterodimers case y was times x . the absolute value of x had no consequence on the resulting dimer population only the x/y value was of consequence . one thousand drawings for dimers were performed the outcomes of which were averaged to yield a mean dimer stock . assembly of tetramers was simulated in silico by drawing pairs of the previously obtained dimers . any drawn pair of dimers was kept as a tetramer . one thousand drawings for tetramers were made and averaged to yield the results shown in figure d .
