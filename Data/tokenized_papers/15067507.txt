is a salt inducible ethylene receptor gene in tobacco . transgenic tobacco plants for this gene show reduced ethylene sensitivity . using cdna microarray analysis we were able to identify those genes that have different _PROTEIN_ levels between transgenic plants and wild type plants under salt stress conditions . one of these which encodes a receptor like kinase with an _LOCATION_ lectin like domain was characterized in detail in the present study . contains a signal peptide an _LOCATION_ lectin like domain a single transmembrane domain and a cytoplasmic protein kinase domain . is transcribed in the root flower and leaf but not in the stem . in wild type arabidopsis salt stress induced the transcription level of whereas in the transgenic arabidopsis induction of the transcript was inhibited and retarded . was constitutively overexpressed in the ethylene overproducer mutant _PROTEIN_ and could be induced by ethylene . however in the ethylene insensitive mutant _PROTEIN_ the salt induced _PROTEIN_ pattern of was the same as that in wild type plants . the results demonstrate that the induction of in response to salt stress is regulated by the ethylene signaling pathway . the induction was inhibited by the ethylene receptor while it was independent of _PROTEIN_ . the kinase activity of was also studied . we found that that can be autophosphorylated and has serine/threonine kinase activities . the subcellular localization of _METHOD_ in onion epidermal cells indicates that is localized on the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ .
by means of microarray analysis of salt stressed transgenic plants and wild type plants we identified an _PROTEIN_ gene being downregulated in transgenic plants under salt stress . belongs to a subfamily of putative plant receptor serine/threonine kinases and is characterized by an _LOCATION_ legume lectin like domain . in arabidopsis the lectin like domain receptor protein kinases comprise a small multigenic family . contains an open reading frame that encodes a protein of amino acids . the predicted protein has four putative distinct domains a signal peptide domain an _LOCATION_ lectin like domain a transmembrane domain and a kinase domain . the signal peptide domain located at the n terminal of consists of amino acids . following the signal peptide is the lectin like domain which is similar to that of legume lectins this domain binds to _LOCATION_ signals . the kinase domain is located at the c terminal of which is the general location of _PROTEIN_ in plants . there are conserved subdomains in the kinase domain and most of the subdomains of the kinase domain have conserved motifs that are identical to those of other members of the protein kinase superfamily . a hydrophobic transmembrane domain was also identified between the kinase domain and the lectin like domain suggesting that is a putative transmembrane protein . the amino acid sequence of was compared with those of three other lectin like _PROTEIN_ and ghlecrk . the degree of similarity of identity of with and was and for the full length amino acid sequence and and for kinase domain sequence respectively . the degree of sequence identity among the lectin like domains was relatively and . therefore the lectin like domains of these proteins are more divergent than the kinase domains . the transcription levels of were examined in the root stem leaf and flower by rt pcr . the same cdna was also used to amplify as an internal control . the results show that the strongest _PROTEIN_ of was found in the root and flower lower _PROTEIN_ was observed in the leaf and almost no _PROTEIN_ was detected in the stem . in order to investigate the different _PROTEIN_ of in transgenic and wild type plants we performed rt pcr using rna obtained from plant material exposed to mm nacl . our results show that in the wild type plants transcription was induced upon salt treatment reaching its highest level within h to h of initiation of the stress and falling thereafter to a normal level . in transgenic plants the _PROTEIN_ pattern was different . the transcription level of in transgenic plants was not significantly affected during the first h of salt stress . subsequently however was apparently induced . the induction was weaken and _PROTEIN_ in comparison to that in the wild type plants . ethylene overproducer mutant _PROTEIN_ and ethylene insensitive mutant _PROTEIN_ were also used to investigate the dynamic _PROTEIN_ of in response to salt treatment . the results indicate that in _PROTEIN_ was constitutively _PROTEIN_ at a relatively higher level and hardly at all influenced by salt stress . however the _PROTEIN_ level of in ethylene insensitive mutant _PROTEIN_ was almost the same as that of the wide type plants in response to salt stress . wild type arabidopsis plants were also exposed to acc and the results show that the transcription level of increased steadily upon this exposure to acc . because has a transmembrane domain we also looked at the subcellular localization of . the fusion gene _METHOD_ and the control _METHOD_ in driven by camv promoter were transformed into onion epidermal cells by particle bombardment . gene _PROTEIN_ was revealed by the green _METHOD_ of the _METHOD_ marker and observed under a confocal microscope . the _METHOD_ fusion protein was localized on the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ whereas the _METHOD_ control protein was _PROTEIN_ present in cytoplasm . in order to differentiate between the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and the cell wall the onion epidermal cells showing _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ were treated with m mannitol . this treatment induces plasmolysis and caused an internalization of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ while the cell wall remained unchanged . in plasmolyzed cells the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ on the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ was internalized and pulled away from the cell wall demonstrating that is localized on the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . since protein possesses a putative kinase domain we _PROTEIN_ this domain as a _PROTEIN_ fusion protein in yeast cells and tested its kinase activity . the _PROTEIN_ protein was purified by affinity resin and resolved by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . the fusion protein exhibited the predicted molecular _METHOD_ of kda . the kd protein was incubated with _PROTEIN_ subjected to _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and then transferred onto pvdf _LOCATION_ . it was apparent on the resulting autoradiograph that had been incorporated into the fusion protein and that there was only a single radioactive band . the position of this band matched that of the recombinant protein detected by _METHOD_ blue staining . therefore had the ability to autophosphorylate . the phosphorylated kd protein was transferred onto pvdf _LOCATION_ and the _LOCATION_ treated with n hcl or n naoh to examine the stability of the phosphorylated residues . the phosphorylated residues were found to be stable under and acid treatment but sensitive to base treatment indicating that the phosphorylated residues were phosphoserine phosphothreonine and/or phosphotyrosine but not phosphohistidine . phosphoamino acid analysis was carried out using two dimensional tlc electrophoresis . the phosphorylated kd was hydrolyzed with n hcl and analyzed together with the phosphoamino acid standards . phosphoserine and phosphothreonine were detected whereas phosphotyrosine was not detected .
