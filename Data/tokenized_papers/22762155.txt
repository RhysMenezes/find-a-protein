while various signalling networks regulate plant responses to heat stress the _METHOD_ regulating and unifying these diverse biological processes are largely unknown . our previous studies indicate that the arabidopsis monothiol glutaredoxin _PROTEIN_ is crucial for temperature dependent postembryonic growth in arabidopsis . in the present study we further demonstrate that _PROTEIN_ has conserved functions in anti oxidative stress and thermotolerance in both yeast and plants . in yeast _PROTEIN_ co localized with yeast in the _LOCATION_ and suppressed the sensitivity of yeast double mutant cells to oxidative stress and heat shock . in plants _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion proteins initially localized in the cytoplasm and the _LOCATION_ envelope but migrated to the _LOCATION_ during heat stress . ectopic _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in tomato plants minimized photo oxidation of chlorophyll and reduced oxidative damage of cell _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ under heat stress . this enhanced thermotolerance correlated with increased catalase enzyme activity and reduced accumulation in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ tomatoes . furthermore during heat stress _PROTEIN_ of the heat shock transcription _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and heat shock protein _PROTEIN_ genes was up regulated in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ transgenic plants compared with wild type controls . thus these findings suggest a specific protective role of a redox protein against temperature stress and provide a genetic engineering strategy to improve crop thermotolerance .
_PROTEIN_ has a conserved trx hd and three tandem grx hds which are similar to yeast and mammalian monothiol grxs while yeast have one grx hd and a mammalian has two repeated grx hds at their c termini . in yeast or deletions do not affect cell growth however deletion of both and significantly reduce cell growth . this impaired growth could be rescued by overexpression of or . to examine whether _PROTEIN_ could complement functions in yeast double mutant cells _PROTEIN_ and c terminal green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ fused _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were _PROTEIN_ in the double mutant strain respectively . both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ could restore mutant cell growth . yeast and are required for cell survival under oxidative stress . to determine whether _PROTEIN_ could suppress the sensitivity of cells to external oxidants both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were _PROTEIN_ in mutant cells and grown in media with or without mm mm diamide . in these conditions both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ like yeast were able to rescue the growth of mutant cells . moreover _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ co localized with yeast _METHOD_ in the _LOCATION_ when _PROTEIN_ in cells . given the conserved function of monothiol _PROTEIN_ in counteracting oxidative stress in yeast we sought to determine whether the effects of _PROTEIN_ on temperature stress responses are also conserved in yeast . in comparison with normal yeast growth conditions yeast mutant cells grown at for min displayed reduced survival rate and treatment at for min further limited their growth indicating that heat stress impaired the growth of yeast mutant cells . when yeast or _PROTEIN_ were _PROTEIN_ in the mutant cells the cells were more tolerant to the temperature stress indicating _PROTEIN_ may also play a crucial role in the protective effects against elevated temperatures . these data suggest that monothiol _PROTEIN_ participates in a conserved defence pathway against high temperature and oxidative stress . based on the yeast results and our arabidopsis data that _PROTEIN_ alleles are hypersensitive to high temperature and display dramatic growth defects under heat stress we hypothesize that enhancing _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ can improve thermotolerance in plants . to test this idea we introduced a construct containing _PROTEIN_ driven by the cauliflower mosaic virus promoter into tomato . more than independent transgenic lines were generated and morphologically normal lines appearing to contain single transgene insertions in southern blot analysis were selected and subjected to further analysis of response and _PROTEIN_ to heat stress _PROTEIN_ . consistent with a single insertion the seeds of these four lines showed a segregation pattern of for the kanamycin resistance marker gene . to obtain homozygous _PROTEIN_ lines segregation analysis on seeds from self pollinated _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plants was carried out on mg/l kanamycin selection medium and the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ was examined by reverse transcriptase pcr analysis . the phenotype of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ tomatoes was indistinguishable from the wild type plants under normal growth conditions . examination of plant height for the month old _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ tomato plants found that they were not significantly different from that of wild type plants . moreover _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ did not affect fruit shape and yield . to investigate the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ in plant cells n terminal _METHOD_ fused _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was transiently _PROTEIN_ in epidermal cells of tobacco leaves through agrobacterium infiltration . the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ signals were primarily detected in the cytoplasm and the _LOCATION_ envelope _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ under normal growth conditions . at increased temperature _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ signals were predominately _LOCATION_ in of cells examined . in contrast free _METHOD_ targeted to _LOCATION_ independent of heat treatment . to further investigate the _PROTEIN_ subcellular localization in tomato plants we generated four stable _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ tomato plants driven by the promoter . _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ from all four transgenic lines could be detected by immunoblot using a _METHOD_ antibody and three lines _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were subjected to subcellular localization analysis of _PROTEIN_ in the guard cells of stomata owing to the much more opaque _LOCATION_ that guard cells have in comparison with the epidermal cells of tomato . during a heat stress we observed that the majority of _METHOD_ signals were localized in the _LOCATION_ from all three lines while no _METHOD_ signals in the _LOCATION_ could be detected under normal growth conditions . together these data indicate that _PROTEIN_ translocate from the cytoplasm into the _LOCATION_ under heat stress . for heat tolerance experiments different homozygous _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plants derived from each of the four transgenic lines _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were analysed . the growth and development of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ tomato plants were indistinguishable from those of wild type plants before heat treatment . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ tomatoes displayed robust growth and heat tolerance after days at followed by days at whereas the wild type plants were severely damaged during these growth conditions . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ lines also displayed heat tolerance under the same growth conditions as compared to wild type plants . the enhanced heat stress tolerance of the transgenic plants was further verified by measuring changes in chlorophyll _METHOD_ . the chlorophyll _METHOD_ fv/fm ratio indicating the maximum quantum efficiency of photosystem ii were similar in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ transgenic plants and the wild type plants during the initial days at however following days at the fv/fm ratio of wild type plants was significantly _PROTEIN_ compared with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ transgenic plants . moreover heat stress caused severe electrolyte leakage in the wild type plants whereas the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ transgenic plants were significantly less damaged indicating increased _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ integrity and reduced disruption of cell _LOCATION_ in the transgenic lines . the enhanced heat stress tolerance of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ transgenic plants compared with wild type plants was also confirmed by measuring above ground fresh and dry weight of the plants . the fresh and dry weight of wild type and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ transgenic plants did not show significant difference when grown under normal temperature for months . however after being treated by heat stress the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ transgenic plants displayed significantly higher fresh and dry weight yields than those of the wild type plants . the transgenic plants demonstrated more robust recovery when transferred to and the yield of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ tomatoes was indistinguishable from that of wild type controls under normal growth conditions . heat stress is accompanied by the formation of ros such as and oh radical causing damage to _LOCATION_ and macromolecules . to investigate the potential mechanism by which _PROTEIN_ improved thermotolerance in tomato we measured accumulation by using diaminobenzidine staining of leaves from wild type plants and three different homozygous _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plants derived from each of transgenic lines _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . in both in vitro and in vivo tests the leaves of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plants displayed less brown spotting and diffuse staining than those of the wild type plants under the heat stress regime indicating less accumulation in the transgenic lines . the intensity and quantity of brown spots caused by accumulation in the leaves was analysed by image j after transforming the pictures to grey scale images . the statistical analysis further confirmed significantly less accumulation in the transgenic lines compared with the wild type plants after the heat treatment . we then investigated the effects of ectopic _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ on the activities of other antioxidant components . we measured peroxidase catalase and glutathione reductase _PROTEIN_ activities in both wild type controls and transgenic lines . the activities of cat but not those of _PROTEIN_ and pod were significantly increased in all _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ lines when compared to wild type controls under both normal and heat stress conditions . together these results suggest that the tolerance of the _PROTEIN_ overexpressing tomato plants against heat stress at least in part results from reducing ros accumulation through the enhancement of the antioxidant activity of cat . the induction of _PROTEIN_ is one of the predominant responses to temperature stress and these _PROTEIN_ perform important physiological functions as molecular chaperones for protein quality control such as preventing the aggregation of denatured proteins and promoting the renaturation of aggregated protein molecules caused by high temperature regimes . given that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ tomatoes are highly tolerant to heat stress a possible interaction between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ was further investigated . to evaluate how the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in heat stressed tomatoes influences the _PROTEIN_ levels of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and lemtshp were selected for real time qrt pcr analysis . after the initial days at both wild type and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ tomato plants _PROTEIN_ showed increased _PROTEIN_ of all three _PROTEIN_ . moreover after days of treatment at plus days of treatment at both wild type and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ tomato plants also showed significantly increased _PROTEIN_ of all three _PROTEIN_ exhibiting more than fold elevated _PROTEIN_ as compared to the _PROTEIN_ after only days of treatment at . most importantly _PROTEIN_ levels of all _PROTEIN_ in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ tomato plants were significantly higher than those of the wild type plants after day of treatment at extreme high temperatures exhibiting more than to fold elevated _PROTEIN_ . heat shock transcription _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ are the components of signal transduction regulating the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ and play an important role in heat stress responses and thermotolerance in plants . given that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ tomatoes showed highly elevated _PROTEIN_ levels of _PROTEIN_ under heat stress a possible interaction between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ was also further investigated . we examined the _PROTEIN_ of two tomato _PROTEIN_ and using qrt pcr analysis . in tomato _PROTEIN_ has been defined as a master regulator of heat stress response whereas _PROTEIN_ is an important _PROTEIN_ for thermotolerance . after days of treatment at _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ tomato _PROTEIN_ showed significantly increased _PROTEIN_ of both and as compared to wild type controls . furthermore after days of treatment at plus day of treatment at _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ tomato _PROTEIN_ displayed significantly increased _PROTEIN_ of both and as compared to wild type controls and _PROTEIN_ lines . these data suggest that up regulation of _PROTEIN_ may account for thermotolerance in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ tomato plants .
