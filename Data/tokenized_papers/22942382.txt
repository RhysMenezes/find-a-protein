the molecular chaperone heat shock _PROTEIN_ is required for acquired thermotolerance in plants and other _METHOD_ . to identify _PROTEIN_ that interact with _PROTEIN_ or that are involved in thermotolerance we screened for extragenic suppressors of a dominant negative allele of arabidopsis thaliana _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . one suppressor _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ encodes a mitochondrial transcription termination _PROTEIN_ related protein one of arabidopsis mterfs about which there is limited functional data . missense _PROTEIN_ and t dna insertion _PROTEIN_ mutants suppress the _PROTEIN_ heat hypersensitive phenotype . furthermore _PROTEIN_ suppresses other heat sensitive mutants and _PROTEIN_ alone is more heat tolerant than the wild type . _PROTEIN_ resides in mitochondria indicating it functions independently of _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ . microarray analysis suggests altered mitochondrial function and/or retrograde signaling in _PROTEIN_ increases transcripts of other _PROTEIN_ and alters _PROTEIN_ of redox related genes . reduced oxidative damage is the likely cause of _PROTEIN_ thermotolerance indicating _PROTEIN_ repairs protein oxidative damage and/or reduced oxidative damage allows recovery in the absence of _PROTEIN_ . changes in organelle encoded transcripts in _PROTEIN_ demonstrate that _PROTEIN_ is involved in organelle gene regulation . the heat tolerance of _PROTEIN_ emphasizes the importance of mitochondria in stress tolerance and defining its function may provide insights into control of oxidative damage for engineering stress resistant plants .
the sensitivity of arabidopsis plants to heat stress can be quantitatively measured in dark grown seedlings by the amount of hypocotyl elongation after heat stress . this hypocotyl elongation assay was used to screen for suppressors of the heat sensitive semidominant _PROTEIN_ mutant allele _PROTEIN_ . dark grown d old _PROTEIN_ seedlings are blocked in hypocotyl elongation after h of heat treatment while the wild type continues to grow . _METHOD_ mutagenized _PROTEIN_ seeds were screened for shot mutants under this condition . intragenic suppressors were analyzed and published previously . four extragenic suppressors were also identified here we report detailed analysis of the first of these suppressors _PROTEIN_ . in addition to suppressing the defect in hypocotyl elongation after heat stress the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutant has a short hypocotyl phenotype under optimal growth conditions . we determined that the short hypocotyl phenotype cosegregates with the suppressing phenotype as a single recessive trait and therefore used the short hypocotyl phenotype for map based cloning of the mutation . after localization to a segment of chromosome sequencing of genes in the mapped region revealed _PROTEIN_ to be a guanine to adenine transition converting a gly to asp at residue in an mterf related protein . the _PROTEIN_ protein is predicted to contain five mterf motifs and an n terminal transit peptide of amino acids . when the _PROTEIN_ protein sequence was used to query the _PROTEIN_ database which contains prediction _METHOD_ for subcellular localization seven out of eight _METHOD_ predicted mitochondrial localization . citation experimentally determined the localization of of arabidopsis mterf proteins using green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ fusions driven by the promoter in both transient assays and transgenic plants . their study concluded that _PROTEIN_ is a mitochondrial protein . we confirmed this result by making a translational fusion of _PROTEIN_ to the n terminus of _METHOD_ driven by the promoter . stable transgenic plants in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutant background were generated . homozygous plants carrying the mterf _METHOD_ fusion complemented the heat tolerant phenotype of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ indicating that the transgene is functional and that the correct gene was identified by map based cloning . protoplasts were isolated from the complemented transgenic plants to examine subcellular localization . to discriminate _METHOD_ _METHOD_ from chlorophyll _METHOD_ and mitotracker _METHOD_ microscopy was performed with spectral imaging followed by linear unmixing revealing _METHOD_ _METHOD_ restricted to mitochondria . these results along with data from citation support the conclusion that _PROTEIN_ is a _LOCATION_ localized mterf . the founding member of the mterf family is human which was originally identified as a _PROTEIN_ responsible for transcription termination by binding to a specific site downstream of the mt _PROTEIN_ gene encoding the mitochondrial rrna thereby regulating the ratio of mitochondrial rrna to mrna . this family of proteins shares an amino acid mterf motif which is composed of two helices followed by a helix . the _PROTEIN_ mutation is located upstream of the first mterf motif . a structural model of the _PROTEIN_ protein was created using i tasser . although _PROTEIN_ does not share significant amino acid sequence similarity with i tasser identified as the closest structural homolog and the _PROTEIN_ model shows an all helical repeat protein comparable to . this type of helical repeat arrangement is typical of rna and dna binding proteins containing repeats of armadillo heat and pum/puf motifs suggesting that _PROTEIN_ is also likely to have _LOCATION_ acid binding properties . we next identified a second allele of _PROTEIN_ designated _PROTEIN_ in the columbia background carrying a t dna insertion after the final mterf motif which would result in elimination of the last amino acids of the predicted protein . we found by rt pcr that the _PROTEIN_ mutant produced a truncated transcript and noticed that the t dna starts with an in frame stop codon . therefore the _PROTEIN_ mutant could produce a partially functional protein . we then created the double mutant _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ to determine if _PROTEIN_ would also suppress the _PROTEIN_ thermotolerance defect . _PROTEIN_ would not be expected to suppress _PROTEIN_ if suppression by the missense _PROTEIN_ mutation was allele specific due to direct physical interaction between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . however after heat stress _PROTEIN_ suppressed the heat sensitive phenotype of _PROTEIN_ even more strongly than the _PROTEIN_ mutation . thus it is unlikely that there is direct interaction between the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ proteins consistent with their different compartmentalization within the cell and the extent of suppression suggests that _PROTEIN_ is a stronger allele than _PROTEIN_ . like _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ seedlings also have a short hypocotyl phenotype in the presence or absence of the _PROTEIN_ mutation . both mutations in the _PROTEIN_ gene make plants grow slowly leading to small stature with _PROTEIN_ showing a more severe growth reduction consistent with the conclusion that this is a stronger allele . we could complement the growth phenotype and the heat stress phenotype caused by the _PROTEIN_ mutation by transformation with wild type _PROTEIN_ genomic dna providing independent confirmation that both phenotypes are caused by the same gene . for further analyses we used _PROTEIN_ the stronger _PROTEIN_ mutant allele . the _PROTEIN_ allele has a dominant negative phenotype which means that the _PROTEIN_ mutant protein is toxic and makes plants more sensitive to heat stress than an _PROTEIN_ protein null allele _PROTEIN_ . it is possible that the suppressing phenotype could result from reducing the dominant negative effect of the _PROTEIN_ mutant protein by downregulating the level of the toxic _PROTEIN_ protein . protein blot analysis of _PROTEIN_ protein levels either after the heat treatment or after recovery at did not show a significant difference between plants with and without the _PROTEIN_ mutations . the results indicate that the _PROTEIN_ mutations provide thermotolerance by a mechanism that is independent from the mechanism involving the chaperone function of _PROTEIN_ . to test whether the suppressing phenotype is dependent in any way on _PROTEIN_ a double mutant with the _PROTEIN_ protein null allele _PROTEIN_ was made . the double mutant _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ also was more thermotolerant than the _PROTEIN_ single mutant when assayed both for hypocotyl elongation and survival of heat treated light grown seedlings . thus the _PROTEIN_ mutation can suppress heat sensitivity in the absence of functional _PROTEIN_ protein . it is clear that other pathways besides those involving _PROTEIN_ contribute to thermotolerance . therefore we sought to determine if the _PROTEIN_ mutation could suppress two other heat sensitive mutants uv _PROTEIN_ and sensitive to hot _PROTEIN_ which impact very different aspects of cellular function . the _PROTEIN_ mutant was identified as a uv sensitive mutant but was _PROTEIN_ found to be defective in thermotolerance . the _PROTEIN_ gene encodes a homolog of human xeroderma pigmentosum d which is an integral part of the basal transcription _PROTEIN_ complex and belongs to the subfamily of helicases . the _PROTEIN_ gene encodes s nitrosoglutathione reductase which metabolizes the nitric oxide adduct s nitrosoglutathione . _PROTEIN_ mutants have increased nitric oxide species that are associated with heat sensitivity . the hypocotyl elongation assay shows that the heat sensitive phenotype of both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ is suppressed by the _PROTEIN_ mutation . suppression is also observed with light grown seedlings in the case of _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ mutant was not tested in this assay because this allele is not sensitive to heat when grown in the light . remarkably the _PROTEIN_ single mutant was more tolerant to heat stress than the wild type indicating that the _PROTEIN_ mutation is a general suppressor of heat sensitivity . enhanced thermotolerance of the _PROTEIN_ mutant was also observed when soil grown plants were subjected to prolonged chronic heat stress at . many studies have reported that increases in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ could enhance heat tolerance of diverse _METHOD_ including plants . therefore we checked the protein level of some major _PROTEIN_ other than _PROTEIN_ known to be important for thermotolerance . the _PROTEIN_ single and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutants when compared with wild type and _PROTEIN_ plants respectively show a minor increase in _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ and small _PROTEIN_ under the heat stress conditions used to assay heat sensitivity . _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ show a minor increase in _PROTEIN_ plants even without heat stress implying that _PROTEIN_ mutant plants may exhibit a stress response even without any heat treatment . it is well established that enhancement of the protein quality control network through increased _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is a major component of the thermotolerance mechanism . however even though the _PROTEIN_ mutants show a small increase in some _PROTEIN_ this subtle difference appears unlikely to account for _PROTEIN_ thermotolerance . therefore to identify other _METHOD_ that could enhance _PROTEIN_ thermotolerance we compared the transcriptional profile of the _PROTEIN_ single mutant with that of wild type plants both with and without heat treatment . microarray analysis was performed using arabidopsis oligonucleotide arrays with the two color dye method to compare the wild type to the mutant . rna samples were prepared from d old plate grown seedlings sampled with or without heat treatment . the microarray data can be found in supplemental data sets and online . for a general overview genes that were both differentially regulated more than fold _PROTEIN_ ratio and that had a false discovery rate adjusted p value of < were selected for analysis . this cutoff value resulted in and differentially regulated genes for the control and heat treatment respectively . gene ontology enrichment analyses performed with these gene subsets are shown for control samples in supplemental table online and heat stress samples in supplemental table online . the _PROTEIN_ mutant showed significant differences in transcripts of genes responsive to stress more specifically oxidative stress in both conditions . a similar observation was made relative to genes with redox related go _METHOD_ in the go category of molecular function . almost twice as many genes related to antioxidant activity were downregulated in _PROTEIN_ under control conditions compared with the wild type . genes with glutathione s transferase activity showed the opposite pattern with nine out of upregulated in _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ that the _PROTEIN_ pattern of many stress responsive genes is altered may indicate that the mutant plants experience stress even under normal growth conditions as is suggested by the increase in _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ proteins without heat treatment . another noticeable go term was not surprisingly differences in genes responsive to heat . supplemental table online lists the heat stress responsive genes that changed in both control and heat stress conditions . specific _PROTEIN_ transcripts were increased in the _PROTEIN_ mutant although the difference in _PROTEIN_ level compared with the wild type was for the most part small with a maximum of fold . from the microarray data it appeared that two possible _METHOD_ could contribute to higher thermotolerance in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . the first mechanism is enhancement of protein quality control through increased _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ other than _PROTEIN_ . the second mechanism is reduced oxidative stress . we observed a small fold increase in transcripts of _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ in the microarray experiment which correlates well with the immunoblot analysis in figure . in addition the transcripts of mitochondrial _PROTEIN_ and mitochondrial small _PROTEIN_ were shown to be higher in _PROTEIN_ than in the wild type with or without heat stress . to confirm results of the microarray experiments quantitative rt pcr was performed on these and other _PROTEIN_ genes . the microarray data were readily confirmed with the exception of transcript levels for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ ci which were not significantly different between wild type and mutant plants . related to the potential role of _PROTEIN_ in mitochondria transcripts of _PROTEIN_ targeted to mitochondria were increased but not transcripts of _PROTEIN_ targeted to _LOCATION_ . this differential mrna _PROTEIN_ was accompanied by related increases in protein levels as shown in figure mitochondrial _PROTEIN_ but not _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ increased in _PROTEIN_ mutants . these results indicate that the mutation causes an indirect effect on the level of mitochondrial _PROTEIN_ . the increased mitochondrial _PROTEIN_ may enhance thermotolerance by _PROTEIN_ protein quality in mitochondria . in the microarray experiment we also found that the alternative oxidase _PROTEIN_ transcript was increased fold in _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ genes have been described as markers for many different stresses . in the mitochondrial electron transport chain _PROTEIN_ proteins play a key role in preventing ros production by accepting electrons from the reduced quinone pool . to determine if this small change in _PROTEIN_ mrna level was reflected at the protein level protein blot analysis was performed . the _PROTEIN_ protein level was highly increased in plants with the _PROTEIN_ mutation with the increase in protein being much more dramatic than that of the transcript . the increase in _PROTEIN_ protein even without the heat treatment indicates that the _PROTEIN_ mutation triggers stress signaling as is also indicated by the increased _PROTEIN_ levels . _PROTEIN_ proteins show no significant further increase with heat treatment . to determine the potential contribution of _PROTEIN_ to the increased thermotolerance of _PROTEIN_ we tested transgenic plants that either under or overexpressed _PROTEIN_ protein . the overexpression line had even more _PROTEIN_ protein than the _PROTEIN_ mutant but it was as heat sensitive as the wild type . in addition over or underexpression of _PROTEIN_ in the _PROTEIN_ background did not affect the _PROTEIN_ heat stress phenotype suggesting that the changes in _PROTEIN_ protein level in the _PROTEIN_ mutant alone can not confer thermotolerance . the induction of _PROTEIN_ protein and go analysis of microarray data led us to look at the oxidative stress aspect of heat stress . we hypothesized that _PROTEIN_ is more tolerant to heat stress because it can better cope with the oxidative stress that occurs with heat treatment . we first examined ros levels using the _METHOD_ dye dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate . plate grown seedlings were treated at or for h and then incubated with before being observed by confocal microscopy . while the ros signal is clearly increased by the heat treatment there was consistently significantly less ros in the _PROTEIN_ mutant than in the wild type . this result predicts there should be also less oxidative damage in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . to test this prediction we measured both lipid and protein oxidation after heat treatment . in accordance with our expectation _PROTEIN_ mutant plants showed less lipid and protein oxidation than the wild type . these data further suggest that the _PROTEIN_ mutant would be more tolerant to oxidative stress . tolerance to oxidative stress was measured by root growth after transferring seedlings to paraquat containing medium . root growth of the _PROTEIN_ mutants was indeed more tolerant to paraquat and the _PROTEIN_ mutant was more tolerant than _PROTEIN_ again indicating that _PROTEIN_ is a stronger allele . consistent with the sensitivity to paraquat _PROTEIN_ had less protein oxidation than the wild type when treated with paraquat as shown in figure . to test the possibility that reduced ros in _PROTEIN_ correlated with increased ability to eliminate ros we checked the activities of the antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase and catalase . while _PROTEIN_ consistently showed a minor increase in mitochondria localized manganese superoxide dismutase a minor _PROTEIN_ in catalase activity was also detected in _PROTEIN_ . these minor changes in the antioxidant enzyme activities would not appear to explain the significant alteration in ros level . thus _PROTEIN_ may have reduced ros due to _PROTEIN_ production of ros rather than increased removal of ros by these enzymes . in summary _PROTEIN_ mutants show reduced accumulation of ros and have better tolerance to oxidative stress which likely contributes to their heat stress tolerance . mutants impaired in mitochondrial function tend to have slow growth rate and wrinkly rosette leaves . the _PROTEIN_ mutant shares these phenotypes which along with the mitochondrial localization of the protein and altered _PROTEIN_ levels indicate that _PROTEIN_ mutants may also be impaired in mitochondrial function . this led us to ask if the response of _PROTEIN_ mutants to heat stress is common to other mutants with mitochondrial dysfunction and if these mutants also have enhanced tolerance to heat stress . we selected two mutants rpotmp and to address these questions . the rpotmp gene encodes a phage type rna polymerase that _METHOD_ gene specific transcription in mitochondria and is targeted to both mitochondria and _LOCATION_ . the loss of function mutant rpotmp is known to have a reduced abundance of respiratory chain complexes i and iv . the gene encodes nadh dehydrogenase iron sulfur protein subunit which is a component of respiratory chain complex i . the null mutation prevents assembly of complex i without affecting other components of respiratory complexes . another loss of function allele of the same gene was shown to be sensitive to freezing and to have increased ros level . in thermotolerance assays with both hypocotyl elongation and light grown seedlings the rpotmp and mutants showed more sensitivity to heat stress in contrast with the _PROTEIN_ mutant . these results demonstrate that mitochondrial dysfunction does not necessarily result in the same heat tolerant phenotype . in addition the rpotmp and mutants had more ros production under heat treatment than the _PROTEIN_ mutant . however the levels of _PROTEIN_ were quite similar to the _PROTEIN_ mutants with heat treatment . in particular the mitochondrial _PROTEIN_ were notably increased in the rpotmp and mutants similar to the _PROTEIN_ mutants . these data indicate that low ros levels in the _PROTEIN_ mutant may be more critical for providing thermotolerance than the increased level of mitochondrial _PROTEIN_ . we noted that _PROTEIN_ is a mutation in an arabidopsis _LOCATION_ localized mterf protein and that it shows parallels to _PROTEIN_ in that it was isolated as a suppressor of the flu mutant which is highly sensitive to singlet oxygen induced cell death . furthermore like _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was subsequently found to be more stress tolerant even in the wild type background . we therefore tested _PROTEIN_ mutant seedlings for heat tolerance . however unlike _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ mutant was not more heat tolerant than the wild type . comparison of the genes upregulated in _PROTEIN_ compared with the genes reported to be upregulated in _PROTEIN_ also showed only eight common upregulated genes . thus the _METHOD_ leading to the different stress protection by these two mterf mutants are distinct and may partly reflect differences in responses to alterations in chloroplasts compared with mitochondria . in mitochondria mterf family proteins are involved in transcription termination as well as mitochondrial dna replication transcription initiation and translational control . since the _PROTEIN_ protein contains no defined motifs other than the mterf motif and it is readily modeled based on with features consistent with _LOCATION_ acid binding we considered that _PROTEIN_ may have a biochemical function similar to homologs in other _METHOD_ . to gain insight into potential roles of the _PROTEIN_ protein in _LOCATION_ acid interactions in mitochondria we assayed the level of transcripts using qrt pcr . the _PROTEIN_ mutant and the line complemented with wild type _PROTEIN_ genomic dna were compared with the wild type . as shown in figure the _PROTEIN_ mutation caused an overall twofold increase in levels of mitochondrial transcripts when normalized against a number of housekeeping genes . there were almost no changes in the transcripts of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . the only downregulated transcript in the _PROTEIN_ mutant was the ccmfc transcript which encodes a subunit of a protein complex reported to be involved in cytochrome c maturation . in contrast with mitochondrial transcripts the _PROTEIN_ mutation had the opposite effect on _LOCATION_ transcripts showing an overall twofold _PROTEIN_ with no significant variation between different genes . to confirm the qrt pcr results specific genes were chosen for rna gel blot analysis . the transcript of the mitochondrial gene _PROTEIN_ was increased but ccmfc was _PROTEIN_ in the _PROTEIN_ mutant as expected based on the qrt pcr data . the ccmfc transcript which contains an intron was correctly spliced in the mutant despite the reduced transcript levels . inconsistent with the qrt pcr data the _PROTEIN_ transcript was increased in the _PROTEIN_ mutant which may reflect the choice of primers for the qrt pcr measurement . changes in transcripts of the _LOCATION_ genes _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ confirmed the qrt pcr data _PROTEIN_ in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . thus the _PROTEIN_ mutation influences transcript levels of the two organelles in opposite ways and may have a specific role in determining the levels of mitochondrial ccmfc rna . to check if the _PROTEIN_ mutation also causes alterations in organelle genome copy numbers qpcr was performed to compare copy numbers of organelle genes in the _PROTEIN_ mutant and the wild type . five representative genes of the organellar and _LOCATION_ genome were selected for this experiment . values for the _LOCATION_ and mitochondrial gene amplifications were normalized to the _LOCATION_ gene amplifications . mitochondrial dna levels in _PROTEIN_ were fold higher than in the wild type and complemented line . the observed general increase in mitochondrial gene transcripts may reflect this increased gene copy number . however the copy number of ccmfc gene was also increased in contrast with the observed transcript _PROTEIN_ . _LOCATION_ dna levels in _PROTEIN_ were only slightly higher than in the wild type and the complemented line . in summary _PROTEIN_ function appears to be required for coordination of _LOCATION_ and mitochondrial gene copy number .
