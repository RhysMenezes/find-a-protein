under phosphate deprivation higher plants change their lipid composition and recycle phosphate from phospholipids . a phospholipase d _PROTEIN_ is involved in this recycling and in other cellular functions related to plant development . we investigated the localization of arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ by cell fractionation and in vivo _METHOD_ confocal imaging . localizes to the tonoplast and the nter regulatory domain is sufficient for its sorting . under phosphate deprivation remains located in the tonoplast but its distribution is uneven . we observed _PROTEIN_ enriched tonoplast domains preferentially positioned close to mitochondria and beside chloroplasts . in absence of _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ developments were visualized inside _LOCATION_ .
_PROTEIN_ protein has been detected as a possible _LOCATION_ protein by a single proteomic analysis . to verify this localization we performed several assays of _LOCATION_ fractionation from arabidopsis cells or plants . a protein was immunodetected at the expected size for _PROTEIN_ in the microsome fraction of arabidopsis cells . this signal was weak and increased in a tonoplast enriched fraction correlated with tonoplast markers such as _PROTEIN_ and v _PROTEIN_ . in contrast it did not show any correlation with chloroplast envelope _LOCATION_ or _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ markers . under pi deprivation the signal was stronger as expected from enhanced _PROTEIN_ and still enriched by purification of the tonoplast fraction . a protein was also immunodetected in a tonoplast fraction similarly prepared from arabidopsis plant leaves and was not present in a pld ko mutant confirming the identity of the _PROTEIN_ signal . several smaller proteins were immunodetected only in the wild type plant suggesting some _PROTEIN_ degradation . altogether immunodetection experiments indicated an association of _PROTEIN_ with the tonoplast . to find out the in vivo _PROTEIN_ localization we prepared a set of _PROTEIN_ constructs of green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ fused to the c terminus of either the entire _PROTEIN_ protein _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or the putative regulatory domain of _PROTEIN_ excluding the phospholipase activity domain _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . the fusion proteins were transiently _PROTEIN_ in pea leaves by biolistic transformation . by confocal imaging after _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ we observed _METHOD_ _METHOD_ at the tonoplast in different types of leaf cells e.g . stomata guard cells and epidermal cells . an additional but weak _METHOD_ was sometimes detected in the _LOCATION_ . for a better delineation of tonoplast dsred was co introduced as a soluble _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ control . _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was thus detected along the dsred _METHOD_ at expected position for tonoplast . when _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was co introduced with a tonoplast marker _PROTEIN_ dsred . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ co localized with _PROTEIN_ dsred _METHOD_ . these results altogether demonstrated a localization of _PROTEIN_ to the tonoplast . stronger _METHOD_ signal and similar sorting to the tonoplast were obtained with nter _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ indicating that the nter part of _PROTEIN_ was sufficient to address the _PROTEIN_ protein to the tonoplast and suggesting that _PROTEIN_ of the _METHOD_ fusion protein was stabilized in absence of the phospholipase activity domain . immunodetection and confocal imaging indicated the localization of _PROTEIN_ in the tonoplast . the presence of _PROTEIN_ in the tonoplast _LOCATION_ can be important for this _LOCATION_ . we checked the aspect of the tonoplast in the pld ko mutant . by electron microscopy we observed an unusual abundance of _LOCATION_ inside the _LOCATION_ . this result was confirmed by imaging of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ tonoplast marker . after biolistic transformation of day old plant leaves the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ indicated _LOCATION_ budding inside the _LOCATION_ of the pld ko mutant that was not apparent in the wild type _PROTEIN_ . electron microscopy and confocal imaging therefore indicated that in absence of _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ development was different . under pi deprivation the suppression of _PROTEIN_ reduces the lipid modification associated with pi deprivation . in order to analyze if the localization of _PROTEIN_ was affected by pi deprivation arabidopsis was stably transformed via agrobacterium transfection with binary vectors containing _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or n ter _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ downstream of the promoter . both in _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and nter _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ plants _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was located at the tonoplast as observed in pea . relative position of mitochondria and chloroplasts as determined respectively by mitotracker and chlorophyll _METHOD_ confirmed localization to tonoplast _PROTEIN_ . under pi deprivation _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was still located at the tonoplast in the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ plants as indicated by cell fractionation analysis . the same localization was observed with nter _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . the overall aspect of the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was however different from the pi sufficient condition . the distribution along the _LOCATION_ was rather uneven especially in young seedlings . when the nter _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ plants were grown on medium for days _METHOD_ _METHOD_ formed a dot pattern on tonoplast . this dot pattern was also observed in the control plants grown on pi medium but the number of highly _METHOD_ dots in the condition was times higher than in the pi condition . after days of culture the dots were brought back to low level in both conditions . we verified that level of _METHOD_ protein was similar in all conditions . the punctuate pattern of the tonoplast was moreover specific to _PROTEIN_ since we did not observed it with other tonoplast _METHOD_ markers . this therefore indicated transient formation of tonoplast domains enriched in _PROTEIN_ and some role of the n ter part of the protein in this formation . since dgdg synthesis induced by pi deprivation is located in the _LOCATION_ envelope and since mitochondria interact with _LOCATION_ at an early stage of pi deprivation we analyzed the possible interaction of these domains with chloroplasts and mitochondria . by chemical labeling with mitotracker we observed in root cells that most of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ domains were very close to mitochondria _PROTEIN_ . in the leaf tissue mitotraker labeling was difficult to obtain under pi deprivation . we however obtained some images showing that _METHOD_ domains were close to mitochondria too . we also observed that a relatively high proportion of _METHOD_ domains were beside chloroplasts _PROTEIN_ .
