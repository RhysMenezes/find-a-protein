to investigate localization and function in plants a _METHOD_ specific biosensor _METHOD_ was created . on lipid dot blots it bound specifically and with high affinity to . transient _PROTEIN_ in cowpea protoplasts labelled _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and highly motile structures undergoing fusion and fission . stable _PROTEIN_ in tobacco by cells labelled similar motile structures but labelled _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ hardly at all . _METHOD_ _METHOD_ strongly co localized with the pre _LOCATION_ marker _PROTEIN_ partially co localized with the endosomal tracer but showed no overlap with the _LOCATION_ marker _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . treatment of cells with wortmannin a _PROTEIN_ kinase inhibitor caused the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ to redistribute into the _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ within min . by cells _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ contained twice as much as _METHOD_ transformed cells but this had no effect on cell growth or stress induced phospholipid signalling responses . upon treatment with wortmannin levels were reduced by approximately within min in both cell lines . stable _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ in arabidopsis plants labelled different subcellular structures in root compared with shoot tissues . in addition labelling the motile structures common to all cells _METHOD_ strongly labelled the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ in leaf epidermal and guard cells suggesting that cell differentiation alters the distribution of . in dividing by cells _METHOD_ labelled vesicles surrounded the newly formed cell plate suggesting a role for in cytokinesis . together these data show that _METHOD_ may be used as a biosensor to specifically visualize in living plant cells .
prior to testing _METHOD_ as a biosensor in plant cells we first needed to confirm the lipid binding specificity of the construct . to this end a _PROTEIN_ fusion was _PROTEIN_ in escherichia coli and the purified fusion protein subjected to a protein lipid overlay assay a nitrocellulose _LOCATION_ with various phosphorylated inositol phospholipids spotted at different concentrations . as shown in figure it specifically bound without cross reacting with any of the other polyphosphoinositide isomers . _PROTEIN_ alone did not give any signal . cowpea protoplasts were transfected with a plasmid containing _METHOD_ under the control of a constitutive promoter . sixteen hours after transfection _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was seen as small punctated structures and also on the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . the small punctated structures were highly motile . occasionally protoplasts with very high _METHOD_ _METHOD_ revealed larger vesicular structures present inside the central _LOCATION_ . in general the protoplast appearance and viability seemed unaffected by the _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ compared with protoplasts _PROTEIN_ unfused _METHOD_ . the advantage of the transient protoplast system is that the _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ constructs can be quickly assessed . a limitation however is that protoplasts undergo excessive cell wall regeneration and are physiologically stressed . hence they are not ideal to monitor dynamics in vivo in response to a stimulus . therefore stably transformed tobacco by cells _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were generated . as a control by cells were transformed with a plasmid containing _METHOD_ only . both cell lines were identical in appearance to untransformed by cells and grew normally . while the _METHOD_ of the control cells was present throughout the _LOCATION_ and the _LOCATION_ the by cells _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ revealed numerous punctated structures that were rapidly moving resembling the structures observed in cowpea protoplasts . these vesicle like structures were of two different sizes smaller and larger vesicles . all labelled vesicles were excluded from the _LOCATION_ . in contrast to the cowpea protoplasts only faint labelling of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ was observed in _METHOD_ by cells . next the dynamics and characteristics of the _METHOD_ labelled vesicles were examined . this was performed by studying subsequent images taken from a time series . most _METHOD_ labelled vesicles were moving displaying kiss and run behaviour although some were found to be stationary for a while before moving out of the focal plane . in addition to kiss and run behaviour _METHOD_ labelled vesicles also appeared to fuse with and separate from each other . the fusion events seemed to be limited to the larger vesicles the smaller appeared to remain single . to determine whether movement of the _METHOD_ labelled vesicles depended on the actin or the microtubular _LOCATION_ two different drugs were used latrunculin a to disrupt the actin _LOCATION_ and oryzalin a microtubule depolymerizing agent . while oryzalin had no effect on the dynamics of the _METHOD_ labelled vesicles latrunculin a completely arrested all movement . these results suggest that _METHOD_ labelled vesicles are transported via the actin _LOCATION_ . wortmannin is a potent inhibitor of _PROTEIN_ kinase activity inhibiting the phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol to . to determine its effect on _METHOD_ labelling cells were treated with wortmannin and followed in time . as shown in figure within minutes of adding wortmannin the _METHOD_ label disappeared from the vesicles and simultaneously appeared in the _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ . after min most of the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was in the _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ . after h labelling reappeared on _LOCATION_ structures but now vesicles appeared larger . wash out of the wortmannin resulted in relocalization of the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ onto the vesicular structures just as in untreated cells . however wortmannin is labile in water so it is also possible that the reversible effect of is due to newly synthesized proteins escaping the inhibition . these results suggest that wortmannin reduces the levels in the vesicles and as a result the _METHOD_ sensor is released and diffuses throughout the _LOCATION_ and into the _LOCATION_ . the accumulation of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ in the _LOCATION_ seemed to be the result of active transport as its _METHOD_ was often much higher than in the _LOCATION_ . in yeast and mammalian cells is _PROTEIN_ localized in endocytic compartments . to investigate its location in plant cells _METHOD_ cells were incubated with the styryl dye which is a commonly used endocytic tracer in plant cell studies . figure shows a representative picture after a min pulse labelling with . typically only approximately of the _METHOD_ labelled vesicles were co labelled with . sometimes partial co labelling was observed . to further investigate the identity of the _METHOD_ labelled vesicles by cells were co transformed with _METHOD_ and either _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ an endosomal/pre _LOCATION_ marker or with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ a _LOCATION_ marker . most of the _METHOD_ labelled vesicles were found to co localize with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . in contrast there was no co labelling of _METHOD_ labelled vesicles and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ labelled _LOCATION_ stacks . frequently however _METHOD_ labelled vesicles appeared in close proximity to the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ labelled _LOCATION_ stacks suggesting a possible transient interaction between the two . as mentioned earlier _METHOD_ cells exhibited no apparent phenotype . however as _METHOD_ labelled endocytic/pre _LOCATION_ vesicles and endocytic transport is involved in various plant signalling processes e.g . auxin transport we wished to determine whether over _PROTEIN_ the biosensor affected the lipid content and associated signalling . to this end pi radiolabelling studies on untransformed _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ transformed cells were conducted . to activate different lipid signalling pathways cells were osmotically stressed or treated with mastoparan . a typical response to hyper osmotic stress is an increase in ptdins while a potent activator of plc and _PROTEIN_ signalling pathways results in the formation of phosphatidic acid and diacylglycerolpyrophosphate . as shown in figure untransformed _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ transformed cells exhibited very similar radiolabelled phospholipid pools and showed identical responses to salt and mastoparan . also lower concentrations of salt produced no differences . hence the transgenes did not seem to interfere with lipid signalling . to further analyse the content of these cells hplc headgroup analyses were performed . strikingly _METHOD_ cells were found to have a twofold higher level than the _METHOD_ cells . as a percentage of total phospholipids _METHOD_ cells contained as opposed to in _METHOD_ transformed cells . treatment with wortmannin reduced the contents by almost within min in both cell lines _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . the levels of hardly changed after the cell treatments . to investigate whether such a biosensor can be used in whole plants transgenic arabidopsis plants stably _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were generated . of the two lines generated homozygous lines grew normally and were indistinguishable from _METHOD_ transformed or untransformed plants . as shown in figure _METHOD_ was _PROTEIN_ throughout the plant and was localized on small highly motile vesicles and sometimes also on _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . the vesicles were similar to those observed in by cells and could also be divided into smaller and larger populations . in root cortical cells _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was only observed on small vesicles . in older root epidermal cells _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ were also labelled . in the tip area of growing root hairs many rapidly moving vesicles were observed . in leaf epidermal and guard cells _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was present on motile vesicular structures but also strongly present on the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . stomata often had large labelled vesicles inside the central _LOCATION_ resembling structures also occasionally observed in cowpea protoplasts . when analysing _METHOD_ transformed cells we occasionally observed cells that were in the middle of the process of division . in such cells containing vesicles strongly accumulated at the growing edges of the newly formed cell plate . a maximal projection of an image stack of a dividing _METHOD_ transformed cell is depicted in figure . it shows that the containing vesicles completely surround the newly formed cell plate as a _PROTEIN_ but importantly did not label the cell plate itself . earlier had been shown to be rapidly internalized into newly formed cell plates . when was added and dividing cells analysed a clear cloud of vesicles was visible as a belt surrounding the newly formed labelled cell plate . these results suggest that is involved in transport of vesicles to the new cell _LOCATION_ but is itself excluded from it .
