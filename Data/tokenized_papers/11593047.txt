we recently isolated the atbi gene the _PROTEIN_ of which suppressed bax induced cell death in yeast . to determine whether the same is true in the plant system transgenic arabidopsis plants overexpressing bax protein under a dexamethasone inducible promoter were generated . on dex treatment such transgenic plants exhibited marked cell death at the whole plant level cell shrinkage membranous destruction and other apoptotic phenotypes . transgenic bax plants were retransformed with a vector containing the atbi gene _METHOD_ under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus promoter . plants _PROTEIN_ both bax and atbi were able to _PROTEIN_ growth on dex treatment by sustaining intracellular integrity . thus we present here direct genetic evidence that the plant antiapoptotic protein atbi is biologically active in suppressing the mammalian bax action in planta .
we obtained several transgenic arabidopsis plants _PROTEIN_ either bax or bax under a dex inducible promoter . bax and bax proteins were detected immunologically in transgenic lines . the same protein was not detected in either wild type or control plants in which a luciferase gene was overexpressed under the same promoter . when transgenic week old plants were transferred to a medium containing variable concentration of dex etiolation at the whole plant level was observed at dex and higher whereas the same was not true for the line . as shown in fig . fig refd within days of and lines being transferred to a medium containing dex severe discoloration and growth retardation were observed whereas no such abnormalities were evident in other plants . the _PROTEIN_ of bax protein in transgenic lines did not affect plant growth . these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ of full length bax protein is essential for induction of plant cell death . time course analysis of leaf discoloration after dex treatment using and lines was also performed . immunoblot analysis revealed that a small amount of bax or bax protein was detected as early as h after dex treatment . as time progressed bax protein levels in dex treated plants rose and remained high until day . color changes of leaves were apparent in the vicinity of veins and extended to the periphery within days . an extensive fall in total protein level was evident by days after dex treatment . chlorophyll breakdown was noted until day . a dna laddering profile was confirmed in leaves of dex treated plants after days whereas no such phenomenon was observed in plants . to monitor the intracellular localization of atbi protein _METHOD_ fused to the c terminal region of atbi _METHOD_ was _PROTEIN_ in yeast and the ability of the fusion protein to suppress cell death was studied . the constructed plasmids atbi _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ were transformed into the yeast strain harboring a galactose inducible bax . in addition plasmids and atbi were also transformed into the same yeast strain . as shown in fig . fig refa when these were plated on the galactose medium cells transformed with atbi or atbi _METHOD_ survived whereas cells transformed with empty vectors _METHOD_ did not confirming that _METHOD_ tagged atbi conferred sufficient activity to suppress bax induced lethality . as shown in fig . fig refb atbi _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was associated with the perinuclear region . to _PROTEIN_ atbi _METHOD_ in plant cells the vector bin atbi _METHOD_ was constructed and introduced into tobacco suspension cells . transgenic cells _PROTEIN_ the atbi _METHOD_ fusion protein displayed a distinct _METHOD_ localization pattern in both perinuclear and reticulate cortical areas indicative of _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ which resembled the image obtained in yeast . treatment of cells with mitotracker red disclosed that atbi _METHOD_ did not always colocalize with mitochondria . as apparent in fig . fig refo atbi _METHOD_ appeared to be associated with the cell plate and the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ during mitosis where _LOCATION_ is known to be distributed . the transgenic plant line was retransformed by an agrobacterium harboring bin atbi _METHOD_ and new transgenic lines _PROTEIN_ both atbi and bax were selected on a medium containing both kanamycin and hygromycin . bax proteins were detected immunologically in the transgenic lines _PROTEIN_ atbi _METHOD_ at h after dex treatment . furthermore these lines exhibited _METHOD_ _METHOD_ in perinuclear and reticulate compartments in the cells which was identical to the pattern in yeast or cells . the distribution of atbi _METHOD_ did not change even after days of dex treatment . accordingly we were prompted to perform experiments to evaluate the effects of atbi _PROTEIN_ on dex induced cell death . as shown in fig . fig refc leaf discoloration was suppressed in plants _PROTEIN_ both bax and atbi which was also supported by the quantitative estimation of chlorophyll content . causal _PROTEIN_ associated with plant cell death are considered to be orchestrated by a variety of key genes engaged in defense responses . we examined the possibility that such coordination may exist in bax induced plant cell death in relation to pathogen related gene _PROTEIN_ as well as the endogenous atbi level . as shown in fig . fig refe accumulation of bax mrna was observed in and atbi _METHOD_ transgenic plants after dex treatment for day . a mrna for atbi _METHOD_ driven by the camv promoter was detected in the transgenic lines atbi _METHOD_ and atbi _METHOD_ . interestingly the level of endogenous atbi mrna was enhanced in and atbi _METHOD_ lines . in contrast we did not observe any apparent differences in the mrna levels of pathogen inducible genes _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . these results indicate that endogenous atbi mrna level coordinate with bax over _PROTEIN_ however this could be insufficient to warrant the survival of bax _PROTEIN_ plants . electron microscopic analysis was performed to examine the intracellular morphology of bax _PROTEIN_ cells . as shown in fig . fig ref cytoplasmic shrinkage was apparent in the mesophyll cells of plants _PROTEIN_ bax compared with those lacking such _PROTEIN_ . the former was characterized by destruction of chloroplasts with impaired lamella structure . as shown in fig . fig ref c and f no such cellular alteration was noted in bax transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ atbi _METHOD_ except an apparent accumulation of starch granules in chloroplasts .
the orf of mouse bax was inserted into the dex inducible vector . the xhoi and spei fragment of which contains sequences encoding the transactivation domain and a portion of the regulatory region of the rat _PROTEIN_ receptor was ligated to the xhoi spei tagged bax cdna . to examine the effect of the c terminal transmembrane region of bax protein pta bax in which the c terminal aa were deleted was also constructed . the resulting constructs pta bax and pta bax were used for agrobacterium mediated transformation of arabidopsis thaliana ecotype col as described by bechtold et al . . transformants were selected on murashige skoog medium containing hygromycin . protein extraction and western blot analysis were performed as described . briefly total protein electrophoresed on _PROTEIN_ gels was blotted to a poly _LOCATION_ which was then treated with anti bax antibody . bax protein was visualized with the enhanced chemiluminescence system according to the manufacturer 's instructions . seedlings treated with or without dex for days were ground in a mortar and pestle with liquid to a fine powder which was then subjected to the dna extraction as described . ten _METHOD_ of dna treated with rnase was electrophoresed on a agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide and photographed on a uv light box . _PROTEIN_ vector atbi _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was constructed by using the sali tagged coding sequence of atbi cdna by ligation in the sali site of cassette vector _METHOD_ possessing a replicon . the s. cerevisiae strain _PROTEIN_ containing the _PROTEIN_ marked mouse bax encoding plasmid bax was transformed with the plasmids _METHOD_ and atbi _METHOD_ by the lithium acetate method . the control plasmids and atbi were also introduced into the yeast as described . ura leu transformants were streaked either on a synthetic dropout _PROTEIN_ plate or on a sd galactose plate and incubated at . to _PROTEIN_ the _METHOD_ tagged atbi in plant cells the coding sequence of atbi amplified by pcr was cloned into the sali site of a _METHOD_ cassette plasmid containing the cauliflower mosaic virus promoter and nopaline synthase terminator . subsequently ecori hindiii fragments were ligated into the ecori/hindiii digested binary vector _PROTEIN_ which resulted in bin atbi _METHOD_ . transformation of tobacco cells was performed as described by shaul et al . by using agrobacterium tumefaciens strain . to obtain arabidopsis plants overexpressing both bax and atbi the transgenic lines were retransformed with the same agrobacterium possessing bin atbi _METHOD_ . transformants were selected on murashige skoog medium containing kanamycin . total rnas were isolated from transgenic lines by using guanidinium thiocyanate as described . total rna electrophoresed on a denaturing agarose gel was transferred to a nylon _LOCATION_ which was then hybridized to the labeled cdna fragments _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in dextran m _PROTEIN_ heat denatured salmon sperm dna . washing was performed at high stringency _PROTEIN_ . the _LOCATION_ was analyzed with an imaging plate scanner _PROTEIN_ . _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was examined at a nm excitation wavelength under a confocal laser scanning microscope or under a _METHOD_ microscope . mitochondria were stained with the _METHOD_ probe mitotracker red . stained cells were examined by using excitation light at a wavelength of nm . for electron microscopic analysis leaf sections obtained from week old plants treated with dex were fixed in glutaraldehyde in cacodylate buffer and treated with . the substituted samples were embedded in spurr 's resin and thin serial sections were prepared with an ultracut n or ultracut s microtome . sections were stained with uranylacetate and lead citrate and observed under an electron microscope .
