the complete sequence of the arabidopsis thaliana genome revealed thousands of previously unsuspected genes many of which can not be ascribed even putative functions . one of the largest and most enigmatic gene families discovered in this way is characterized by tandem arrays of pentatricopeptide repeats _PROTEIN_ . we describe a detailed bioinformatic analysis of members of the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ family plus genomic and genetic data on the _PROTEIN_ localization _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and general function of many family members . the basic picture that arises from these studies is that _PROTEIN_ proteins play constitutive often essential roles in mitochondria and chloroplasts probably via binding to organellar transcripts . these results confirm but _METHOD_ extend the very sparse observations previously obtained from detailed characterization of individual mutants in other _METHOD_ .
with the completion of the sequencing of the arabidopsis genome we were able to search for all the _PROTEIN_ genes in arabidopsis . we first used the alignment of previously identified _PROTEIN_ motifs to obtain a consensus model using the hmmer package . this _PROTEIN_ signature _PROTEIN_ was subsequently used to search for _PROTEIN_ motifs in the six reading frames of the whole arabidopsis genome . because _PROTEIN_ motifs are highly degenerate a fairly large number of false positive hits were expected . however because _PROTEIN_ motifs are almost always observed in proteins as tandem repeats we could remove most random uninteresting matches by omitting all orphan _PROTEIN_ motifs that were found farther than nucleotides from any other _PROTEIN_ motif . the _PROTEIN_ motifs retained formed clusters each of which comprises a putative _PROTEIN_ gene . each _PROTEIN_ motif cluster was then investigated in detail by manually analyzing the positions and reading frames of the _PROTEIN_ motifs compared with arabidopsis genome initiative _PROTEIN_ open reading frame models in the same region sequenced cdnas or ests matching to the same region and predicted n terminal mitochondrial and _LOCATION_ targeting sequences within potential coding sequence in the region . from this analysis putative _PROTEIN_ orf models were constructed . as of release of the institute for genomic research annotations of arabidopsis proteins of the _PROTEIN_ orfs are annotated as _PROTEIN_ containing proteins based on matches with the pfam profile or interpro profile . three other _PROTEIN_ models are annotated as homologs of known _PROTEIN_ proteins . of the two sets of orf models are identical _PROTEIN_ . twenty four _PROTEIN_ models do not have equivalents in our set nine because we do not consider them to be _PROTEIN_ containing proteins by our criteria _PROTEIN_ and because we consider them to be probable pseudogenes . six of our models have no _PROTEIN_ equivalent and correspond to genes apparently overlooked during the _PROTEIN_ annotation or considered to be pseudogenes . in three more cases we split _PROTEIN_ models into two to form six new models because we felt that the tigr annotations had fused tandemly duplicated _PROTEIN_ genes . we also found six other cases of probable fusions of orf models this time between _PROTEIN_ genes and members of completely unrelated families . in all of our models differ in at least some respects from the corresponding _PROTEIN_ model . it should be noted that in very few of these cases are molecular data available that can be used to decide between the two discordant models . our choice has been generally made by comparison with other genes in the family and a general familiarity with these proteins . this manually annotated version of the _PROTEIN_ family from the arabidopsis genome is available in the supplemental data online . the _PROTEIN_ motifs are usually present in proteins as tandem arrays of about a dozen repeats . in about one half of the family these _PROTEIN_ motifs are adjacent to each other without gaps between the motifs . in the other half of the family we observed regular gaps between _PROTEIN_ motifs of to amino acids . we extracted and aligned the fragments found separating _PROTEIN_ motifs and these alignments were used to define models using the hmmer package . this analysis allowed us to define two new motifs of and to amino acids . these consensus sequences were compared with _PROTEIN_ consensus showing that the two motifs are clearly related to the _PROTEIN_ motif . in particular the secondary structure predictions for the two motifs strongly suggested a pair of helices as already proposed for the _PROTEIN_ motif . these two motifs were named the _PROTEIN_ like s and _PROTEIN_ like l motifs . the l motifs in particular are variable in size and sequence and several variants could be defined . the two major variants described in figure have been used in this study . the hmmer _PROTEIN_ for these motifs were used to search for _PROTEIN_ like motifs in the six frames of the arabidopsis genome _PROTEIN_ . because all these _PROTEIN_ like motifs are related many overlapping or coincident matches were obtained . in these cases the arrangement of nonoverlapping motifs giving the highest cumulative _METHOD_ scores was retained . after removing redundant motifs in this way l type and s type motifs were found in > proteins to add to the p type classical _PROTEIN_ motifs . it is noticeable that these motifs were only found in previously identified _PROTEIN_ proteins reinforcing the idea that these motifs are highly related to _PROTEIN_ motifs . by contrast these motifs were not found in all the _PROTEIN_ proteins identified in arabidopsis . slightly less than half of the _PROTEIN_ proteins present an organized pattern of triple motifs repeated along the protein sequence . this subclass of the _PROTEIN_ family corresponds to the arabidopsis plant combinatorial and modular protein _PROTEIN_ family previously discovered by bioinformatic analysis of the arabidopsis genome . they described proteins characterized by a combinatorial organization of a b and c motifs . these motifs identified on the basis of sequence similarity rather than structural considerations match to parts of the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ related motifs that we describe here . the a b and c motifs correspond to the n terminal part of the l motif an internal peptide of the s motif and a peptide overlapping with s and _PROTEIN_ motifs respectively . aubourg et al . considered that the sequence similarity between pcmp proteins and _PROTEIN_ proteins was not significant but the structural and organizational similarities highlighted by this genome wide study strongly suggest that they are related and belong to the same superfamily . _PROTEIN_ proteins contain from to at least copies of the _PROTEIN_ motif or its variants with an average of motifs per protein usually in a single unbroken tandem array that _METHOD_ at least two thirds of the protein sequence . there are clear indications that polymorphism within the family can be because of deletion or duplication of tandem repeats and this coupled with the difficulty in obtaining unambiguous alignments given the number of repetitions of similar sequence makes sequence homology based _METHOD_ of the family difficult or impossible to interpret . many _PROTEIN_ proteins contain sequences unrelated to _PROTEIN_ motifs either before or after the tandem arrays of _PROTEIN_ motifs . the sequences before are mostly comprised of organelle targeting sequences and show little sequence similarity . however the sequences following the _PROTEIN_ motifs show considerable sequence conservation in many cases . to characterize c terminal motifs in the _PROTEIN_ family we aligned the polypeptide sequences c terminal of the last _PROTEIN_ related motif from all of the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ proteins . this alignment allowed us to define three motifs that were defined in more detail using the hmmer package . the e e and dyw motifs were found in and arabidopsis proteins respectively . they roughly correspond to the e f g and h motifs defined by citation from _PROTEIN_ proteins . despite the _PROTEIN_ that these new motifs are not related in sequence to the _PROTEIN_ motifs the three motifs were only found in members of the _PROTEIN_ family and not in any other arabidopsis protein with the exception of _GENE_ which contains a lone dyw motif . interestingly they were only found in the subfamily defined by p l s repeats . the relative organization of the three c terminal motifs follows several quasi absolute rules the motifs are never observed in multiple copies in the same protein when the motifs are observed in the same protein they are ordered colinearly e e dyw dyw being the c terminal tripeptide proteins carrying the dyw motif almost always have preceding e and e motifs similarly proteins carrying e motif always have a preceding e motif . the identification of these motifs allowed us to define four subclasses in the p l s subfamily proteins that do not have any of the three c terminal motifs proteins with the e motif alone proteins with e and e motifs and proteins with the e e and dyw motifs named the p l s e e and dyw subclasses respectively . these subclasses of the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ family contain and proteins respectively . in contrast with _PROTEIN_ motifs that appear to be tpr related motifs the three c terminal motifs do not resemble any previously described polypeptide motif . the e and e motifs are highly degenerate motifs but the high conservation in the amino acid sequences and the presence of invariant cys and his in the dyw motif may imply a catalytic function for this domain . _PROTEIN_ genes are fairly evenly distributed throughout the chromosome _METHOD_ with little in the way of obvious clusters . the densest grouping of _PROTEIN_ genes lies on the long arm of chromosome where genes and several probable pseudogenes lie within little more than one megabase . many of the genes in this cluster are closely related and they include the closest arabidopsis homologs of the recently cloned _METHOD_ restorer genes from petunia radish and rice . the radish restorer rfo lies in a region that is very clearly syntenic to this arabidopsis cluster . a noticeable characteristic of _PROTEIN_ genes is that they rarely contain introns within the coding sequence . more than of our _PROTEIN_ orf models contain a single exon and only contain more than one intron . these figures are astonishingly low compared with the average of five introns or more for other arabidopsis genes . this characteristic explains why _PROTEIN_ genes are relatively short _PROTEIN_ despite the _PROTEIN_ that _PROTEIN_ proteins are comparatively large proteins . to characterize the _PROTEIN_ family in a variety of other _METHOD_ we collected data on several fully sequenced and annotated genomes or almost completely annotated genomes . using the hmmer _PROTEIN_ defined using arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ e and dyw motifs we searched for these motifs in the collected genomes . the criteria for the motif search were an _METHOD_ e value < and at least one pair of _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ like repeats in any protein hit . using these criteria no _PROTEIN_ proteins were identified in any of the prokaryotic genomes that we analyzed except for a single protein from r. solanacearum . this _PROTEIN_ like protein appears to be a fairly recent capture by horizontal transfer . by contrast _PROTEIN_ motifs were found in all eukaryotes analyzed but with an extraordinary discrepancy in numbers between plant and nonplant _METHOD_ . thus whereas arabidopsis and rice have several hundreds of _PROTEIN_ genes in their genome the human genome encodes only six putative _PROTEIN_ proteins . trypanosomes recently linked to the plant kingdom and the red alga c. merolae have more _PROTEIN_ proteins than humans but many fewer than the two plant genomes . the list of putative nonplant _PROTEIN_ proteins is given in supplemental table online . we also looked for e and dyw motifs and for l and s variants of _PROTEIN_ motifs but we were unable to find conclusive examples of any of them outside the higher plant genomes indicating that the p l s half of the family is strictly restricted to plants . _PROTEIN_ proteins are specific to eukaryotes most of the few known _PROTEIN_ proteins have roles in mitochondria or _LOCATION_ and the _PROTEIN_ family was discovered while systematically screening arabidopsis proteins for those predicted to be targeted to mitochondria or chloroplasts . we therefore checked for predicted targeting signal peptides at the n terminus of _PROTEIN_ proteins using the targetp and predotar prediction _METHOD_ . both _METHOD_ assigned most of the proteins of the family to either mitochondria or _LOCATION_ . using the predotar program and a threshold probability of and of the _PROTEIN_ proteins were predicted to be targeted to mitochondria or _LOCATION_ respectively . targetp gave similar results . differences were observed in the proportion of the different targeting predictions between the various subclasses . for example whereas pure _PROTEIN_ proteins are mostly predicted to be targeted to mitochondria dyw proteins are almost as likely to be predicted to be targeted to _LOCATION_ as to mitochondria . furthermore the percentage of predicted untargeted proteins in the e e and dyw subclasses is significantly higher than in the pure _PROTEIN_ subfamily . these differences might reflect fundamental differences in the function of these proteins but they may simply be because of major differences in orf model quality members of the pure _PROTEIN_ subfamily being better known and more _PROTEIN_ than the other subclasses . overall the percentage of observed false negative results using predotar or targetp is to _PROTEIN_ . furthermore because less than half of the _PROTEIN_ orf models could be validated by cdna sequences and because small exons were found at the end of a few cdna validated _PROTEIN_ orf models some of the models are undoubtedly lacking the correct initiation codon and thus are missing a potential targeting peptide . although it is not possible to definitively conclude our targeting prediction results are consistent with the idea that very few if any _PROTEIN_ proteins are localized outside the organelles of plant cells . to further characterize the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ proteins we experimentally analyzed the localization of several _PROTEIN_ green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion proteins . a set of _PROTEIN_ proteins representing each subclass of the _PROTEIN_ family was chosen for the targeting experiments . the corresponding full length orfs and the n terminal targeting signal coding sequences were systematically cloned into a gateway entry vector . this recombinational cloning system was subsequently used to further subclone _PROTEIN_ orfs and _PROTEIN_ presequences into several _METHOD_ or destination vectors . pol type vectors were used for electroporation of tobacco protoplasts . agrobacteria carrying binary vectors were used for agroinfiltration of nicotiana benthamiana leaves . the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ proteins was analyzed in these experiments . we were able to observe _METHOD_ for out of these _PROTEIN_ protein fusions . for the remaining _PROTEIN_ proteins we were unable to detect any interpretable _METHOD_ signal for any of the constructs tested the fusion proteins either aggregating or not accumulating to detectable levels . subcellular localization of selected _PROTEIN_ proteins when several different constructs or transformation methods were used for the experimental localization of the same _PROTEIN_ protein the results were always consistent . in summary as shown in table _PROTEIN_ proteins were shown to be targeted to mitochondria and eight were shown to be targeted to _LOCATION_ . the results were in general consistent with the bioinformatics predictions for the proteins tested which implies that the predictions for the family as a whole are likely to be not far wrong . whereas some _PROTEIN_ proteins were predicted to be nonorganellar mitochondria and _LOCATION_ were the only subcellular localization that we observed in our experiments . in addition no cases of dual targeting to mitochondria and _LOCATION_ were observed for any of the _METHOD_ fusions . one of the reasons why such a huge family of proteins was discovered only very recently in arabidopsis is that few ests corresponding to _PROTEIN_ genes were previously identified . among the cdna and est sequences available from _PROTEIN_ only transcripts are from _PROTEIN_ genes corresponding to only out of the genes described here . using the same database of all predicted arabidopsis genes have proof of _PROTEIN_ from est or cdna data . this implies that _PROTEIN_ genes are _PROTEIN_ at low levels and could even mean that many are not _PROTEIN_ at all . to investigate this further we analyzed _PROTEIN_ transcripts in rna from two organs expected to show high _PROTEIN_ of genes for mitochondrial and _LOCATION_ proteins namely flowers and leaves . this was performed by systematic rt pcr amplification using primer pairs from the complete arabidopsis transcriptome microarray project each corresponding to a different _PROTEIN_ transcript and also by microarray experiments using the full set of catma gene specific probes . each technique detected _PROTEIN_ of to of _PROTEIN_ genes but taken together evidence of _PROTEIN_ of the vast majority of _PROTEIN_ genes could be obtained . interestingly all three methods of transcript analysis detected a much higher proportion of transcripts from _PROTEIN_ subfamily genes than from p l s subfamily genes . this difference is highly significant . the same tendency toward higher _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ subfamily genes was found in a quantitative analysis of the microarray data . we found that members of the pure _PROTEIN_ subclass were in general _PROTEIN_ at higher levels than the other members of the family . although hybridization signals between different genes on microarrays are not strictly comparable because of variations in probe efficiency the large number of genes in the family allows broad conclusions to be drawn . taken together these results confirm the low overall level of _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ gene family and the extremely low _PROTEIN_ levels of the p l s subfamily . we looked at various experiments comparing different plant organs and we never observed any obvious deviation of the _PROTEIN_ cloud from the central diagonal indicating that these genes are _PROTEIN_ generally constitutively . this is illustrated in figures and where the genes encoding predicted _LOCATION_ targeted _PROTEIN_ proteins fail to show the bias toward higher _PROTEIN_ in leaves exhibited by the bulk of genes encoding predicted chloroplast proteins and in _PROTEIN_ behave indistinguishably from genes encoding predicted mitochondrial _PROTEIN_ proteins . _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ genes detected by different methods reverse genetics and especially sequenced insertion mutant collections are valuable resources for obtaining information about the function of unknown genes . the collections from versailles from gabi and from the salk institute were screened to look for insertions in arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ genes . not surprisingly given the large size of the family many putative insertion mutants are listed in these databases . we further characterized some of these mutants corresponding to different subclasses of the _PROTEIN_ family . among the mutants we have genetically characterized so far we were unable to find homozygous plants for six mutants when we looked at progeny from heterozygous plants . dissection of the siliques of heterozygous mutant plants showed that about one fourth of the embryos aborted at an early stage indicating that the homozygous mutation was lethal in early stages of embryo development . furthermore in direct genetic screens for embryo lethal mutations the arabidopsis seedgenes project has identified many _PROTEIN_ mutants . taken together these results indicated that many _PROTEIN_ genes have an essential function in plant embryos that leads to the abortion of the embryos if the genes are mutated . for the remaining _PROTEIN_ mutants homozygous plants were found . most of them did not have any obvious macroscopic phenotype . five mutant lines were found with a clear visible phenotype on homozygous plants three of these present short siliques containing many deformed embryos . two of these lines carry an insertion in the same gene . a fourth line with a clear slow growth phenotype carries an insertion in a gene that when knocked out by an independent insertion gives rise to an embryo lethal phenotype . twelve out of fourteen genes encoding proteins predicted to be targeted to _LOCATION_ give rise to a phenotype when the mutation is homozygous but of the mutations in genes encoding predicted mitochondrial proteins generate no observable macroscopic phenotype . list of arabidopsis t dna mutants with insertions in _PROTEIN_ genes as a preliminary study of the rna binding capacity of the _PROTEIN_ protein family the proteins _GENE_ _GENE_ and representing different subclasses of the family were synthesized in vitro and incubated with homoribopolymers ssdna and dsdna . all four _PROTEIN_ proteins preferentially bound poly homoribopolymers whereas the previously characterized rna recognition motif containing protein which was used as a positive control in this study bound poly and poly rna . consistent with these data competition experiments indicated that for each of the four _PROTEIN_ proteins analyzed the addition of of either poly rna or total rna competed for their poly binding capacity . in conclusion these results demonstrate that the four _PROTEIN_ proteins tested show a much higher affinity to poly rna than to the other three homoribopolymers and dna . the biological significance of these findings remains to be elucidated in future experiments hopefully via the identification of physiological rna targets .
arabidopsis thaliana genomic sequences predicted protein sequences and functional annotations were obtained from tigr . clustalw version was used for aligning multiple peptide sequences to construct alignments as input to the hmmer package versions which was used to construct models of different _PROTEIN_ motifs and then to search peptide sequences for these motifs . the _METHOD_ hmmbuild and hmmcalibrate were used to construct _PROTEIN_ describing the motifs and _METHOD_ was used for discovering motifs within protein sequences . the default parameters were used in all cases . a modified version of the _PROTEIN_ database and interface was used for much of the visualization needed for manual annotation including display of _PROTEIN_ motifs _PROTEIN_ orf models known mrnas and predicted mitochondrial and _LOCATION_ targeting sequences . predotar version and targetp version were used for prediction of organelle targeting from protein sequences . a modified version of predotar was used to predict regions encoding putative targeting sequences in genomic dna . secondary structure predictions of _PROTEIN_ motifs were performed with the predictprotein server using the alignments of motifs described previously . the complete predicted proteomes of various _METHOD_ used to create table were obtained from the national center for biotechnology information refseq database apart from trypanosoma brucei sequences and cyanidiodschyzon merolae sequences . the alignment files hmm _PROTEIN_ and search results are available in the supplemental data online . the microarray analysis has been performed with the catma array containing gene specific tags _PROTEIN_ from arabidopsis . the _PROTEIN_ amplicons were purified on multiscreen plates and resuspended in te _METHOD_ at . the purified probes were transferred to well plates with a genesis workstation and spotted on ultragaps slides using a microgrid ii . the catma array printed at the de recherche en consists of three metablocks each composed of blocks of spots . a block is a set of spots printed with the same print tip . in these arrays a print tip is used three times to print a block in each metablock . for the transcriptome studies eight sets of arabidopsis columbia plants were grown on horticultural potting soil under cool white light at with a h photoperiod at humidity . four pooled samples of young leaves were harvested at stage and four pooled samples of flower buds harvested at stage the material being collected to h into the light period . rna was extracted from these samples using _PROTEIN_ extraction followed by two ethanol precipitations and then checked for rna integrity with the bioanalyzer from agilent . crnas were produced from of total rna from each sample with the message amp arna kit . then of crnas were reverse transcribed in the presence of units of superscript ii dutp and dutp according to citation for each slide . samples were combined purified and concentrated with microcon columns . slides were prehybridized for h and hybridized overnight at in formamide . slides were washed in ssc _PROTEIN_ for min ssc for min ssc for min and ssc for min and dried by centrifugation . four hybridizations were performed . the arrays were scanned on a genepix scanner and images were analyzed by genepix pro . for rt pcr validation mrnas were purified from the extracts described above with dynabeads according to the manufacturer 's specifications . fifty _METHOD_ of mrna per reaction were reverse transcribed in the presence of units of superscript ii . pcr reactions for each sample were performed in well plates each with of the rt reaction and the corresponding set of specific catma primers for each of _PROTEIN_ genes in presence of units of platinum taq dna polymerase . the pcr conditions were for min followed by cycles of for s for s and for s _PROTEIN_ followed by cycles of for s for s for s and finally for min . additional pcr reactions were performed on rt minus samples as negative controls . the rt pcr products were validated by size verification after electrophoresis on agarose gels . the statistical analysis was based on two dye swaps _PROTEIN_ . the controls were used for assessing the quality of the hybridizations but were not included in the statistical tests or the graphical representation of the results shown in the results . for each array the raw data comprised the logarithm of median feature pixel intensity at wavelengths nm and nm . no background was subtracted . in the following description log ratio refers to the differential _PROTEIN_ between leaves and flowers . it is either _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ according to the experiment design . an array by array normalization was performed to remove systematic biases . first we excluded spots that were considered badly formed features . then we performed a global intensity dependent normalization using the loess procedure to correct the dye bias . finally for each block the log ratio median calculated over the values for the entire block was subtracted from each individual log ratio value to correct print tip effects on each metablock . to study the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ genes we first tested if the distribution of the maximum signal intensity of the leaf and the flower samples differed between _PROTEIN_ subfamilies . for each array and for each gene we calculated according to the method of citation a normalized logarithm of median feature pixel intensity . we kept the maximum of these normalized intensities for each gene . the statistical test used was a one tailed wilcoxon rank sum test . to determine differentially _PROTEIN_ genes we performed a paired t test on the log ratios . the number of observations per spot varies between two and four and is inadequate for calculating a gene specific variance . for this reason we assume that the variance of the log ratios is the same for all genes and we excluded spots displaying extremes of variance . the raw p values were adjusted by the bonferroni method which controls the family wise _LOCATION_ rate . a total of genes were found to be differentially _PROTEIN_ between flowers and leaves taking a fwer of . amongst these only are _PROTEIN_ genes out of the represented by _PROTEIN_ in the array _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . the relative stability of _PROTEIN_ gene _PROTEIN_ was confirmed by applying wilcoxon rank sum tests on the normalized log ratios to determine whether the _PROTEIN_ differs or not between leaves and flowers . after the removal of badly formed features we retained four replications of the normalized log ratios for _PROTEIN_ three observations for _PROTEIN_ and two observations for _PROTEIN_ . the absolute value of log ratio threshold corresponding to a fwer of is when four observations are available . it increases respectively to and when three and two observations are available . in figure we indicate the thresholds of the log ratios corresponding to a fwer of when four observations are available . the orfs of intronless _PROTEIN_ genes were pcr amplified from arabidopsis genomic dna using pfx dna polymerase and primers flanked with and sites and cloned into the entry vector by gateway recombination . for targeting experiments either the whole orf or just the first codons were cloned in this way . for the _LOCATION_ acid binding assays the orfs were cloned starting from the predicted start of the mature protein to remove most or all of the putative targeting sequences . targetp was used for predicting the extent of the targeting sequences . in all cases the primer included kozak and shine dalgarno consensus sequences to maximize translation in eukaryotic or prokaryotic _METHOD_ . details on the cloning procedures including the primer sequences are available in the supplemental data online . two types of experiments were performed . the sequences coding for precursor _PROTEIN_ proteins or putative targeting sequences were shuttled into greengate or redgate vectors from the corresponding vector using gateway recombination . these constructs were used to _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or fusion proteins in electroporated tobacco protoplasts using previously described protocols . binary destination vectors _METHOD_ _METHOD_ were created by transferring the _METHOD_ or cassettes respectively from greengate or redgate into pgreenii and the sequences coding for precursor _PROTEIN_ proteins or putative targeting sequences were shuttled into these vectors from the corresponding as before . in this case _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ fusion proteins were transiently _PROTEIN_ in nicotiana benthamiana leaves via agroinfiltration . agrobacterium tumefaciens strain harboring the transformation helper psoup and the _METHOD_ or constructs were grown overnight and resuspended in infiltration media at an od of . protoplasts were prepared from leaf material cut into small pieces and incubated in enzyme solution at for to h. _METHOD_ proteins were visualized using an eclipse inverted microscope a _METHOD_ b filter block and a custom filter block for detection of _METHOD_ . the sequences coding for the mature _PROTEIN_ proteins and _PROTEIN_ were shuttled into from the corresponding vector using gateway recombination . proteins were synthesized by coupled transcription translation in the presence of met . homoribopolymers cross linked to agarose beads were obtained from sigma aldrich . concentrations were equilibrated to mg per ml packed gel by dilution with the appropriate volume of sepharose _PROTEIN_ . single and double stranded dna cellulose were obtained from sigma aldrich . the _LOCATION_ acid binding assay was performed as described by citation . a fold excess of competitor rna was used for competition experiments . the bound fraction of proteins was analyzed by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and the relative protein amounts were calculated by a phosphor imager . arabidopsis plants were grown on soil in a growth chamber under the following conditions photoperiod h day h night temperature night humidity . plants were genotyped by pcr . two specific primers from each side of the insertion site were used to detect wild type loci . one primer specific to the genomic sequence near the insertion site and one primer from the t dna border were used to amplify a fragment flanking each insertion . these fragments were sequenced for precise localization of the insert . in all mutants described here the insertion is within the coding sequence . plants from at least seeds of each initial stock were genotyped to obtain at least one heterozygous plant . twenty four seeds from each heterozygote were grown for genotyping to detect plants homozygous for the t dna insertion . the complete set of microarray data from these experiments has been submitted to arrayexpress .
