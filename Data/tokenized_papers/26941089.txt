the endomembrane system plays essential roles in plant development but the proteome responsible for its function and organization remains largely uncharacterized in plants . here we identified and characterized the hypersensitive to latrunculin _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ protein isolated through a forward genetic screen in arabidopsis thaliana for mutants with heightened sensitivity to actin disrupting drugs . _PROTEIN_ is a plant specific tetratricopeptide repeat domain containing protein of unknown function encoded by a single arabidopsis gene . _PROTEIN_ associated with the trans _LOCATION_ network /early endosome and tracked along filamentous actin indicating that it could link post _LOCATION_ traffic with the actin _LOCATION_ in plants . _PROTEIN_ was found to interact with the adp ribosylation _PROTEIN_ guanine nucleotide exchange _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ by coimmunoprecipitation . the mutant phenocopied the mild root developmental defects and latrunculin b hypersensitivity of and analyses of a double mutant showed that and operate in common genetic pathways . based on these data we propose that _PROTEIN_ together with form a complex with actin to modulate the function of the tgn/ee at the intersection of the exocytic and endocytic pathways in plants .
approximately t dna activation tagged seedlings in the col background were grown on media supplemented with nm latb . seedlings with significantly reduced primary root length were isolated and their progeny were retested for increased latb sensitivity . three nonallelic mutants whose primary roots were hypersensitive to latb were identified and was selected for further study . hypocotyls of grown in the dark and root hairs of light grown seedlings were also hypersensitive to latb . moreover primary roots displayed increased sensitivity to cytochalasins another class of actin disrupting compounds . analysis of seedlings revealed a segregation of wild type mutant for a ratio indicating that is recessive in a single mendelian locus . homozygous plants were backcrossed at least three times with col to reduce the frequency of extraneous mutations . osmotic stress salt stress and the auxins indole acetic acid and naphthaleneacetic acid inhibited primary root growth in to a similar extent as in the wild type indicating that is hypersensitive only to latb and cytochalasin compounds that directly interfere with actin polymerization . the response of other mutants to genes encoding actin regulatory proteins including single mutants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and and quadruple mutant _PROTEIN_ to latb was also compared with . these mutants exhibited wild type sensitivity to latb . _PROTEIN_ a mutant of a root _PROTEIN_ vegetative actin isoform also showed wild type sensitivity to latb . although _PROTEIN_ a mutant of another root _PROTEIN_ vegetative actin isoform was hypersensitive to latb its heightened sensitivity to the chemical was not as severe as that of . we asked whether the increased sensitivity of roots to latb could be explained by inhibition of cell division cell expansion or both . to address this question cortical cell length in the root elongation zone and cortical cell number in the meristem was obtained from confocal microscopy analyses of propidium iodide stained roots d after transplanting seedlings on media with or without nm latb . both cortical cell number in the root meristem and cortical cell length in the elongation zone were reduced in latb treated seedlings compared with the wild type indicating that inhibition of both processes contributed to the hypersensitivity of the mutant to the drug . we next analyzed f actin organization in cells of the elongation zone of wild type and seedlings _PROTEIN_ the live cell f actin reporter _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ transplanted to growth media with or without nm latb . cells in the root elongation zone of both genotypes on control medium showed dense and random f actin arrays a feature typical of cells within this region . when transplanted on latb wild type cells _PROTEIN_ their dense network of f actin that roughly mirrored the controls with the exception of a few _METHOD_ aggregates . by contrast cells in the root elongation zone of latb treated had mostly diffuse _METHOD_ fewer distinct f actin arrays and more numerous _METHOD_ aggregates compared with the wild type . to quantify the effect of latb on f actin integrity filament density in cells from the elongation zone was measured using an algorithm developed earlier . whereas the wild type and on the control medium and wild type on latb supplemented medium had similar occupancy values latb treated had significantly lower f actin occupancy values indicating that f actin structures of were indeed more sensitive to the chemical . close examination of seedlings revealed that they had mild growth defects even when latb was excluded from the growth medium . primary roots of were slightly shorter than the wild type at and d after planting . root hairs were also shorter than those of the wild type . furthermore differential interference contrast microscopy showed that root hairs were wider and had subtle shape distortions when compared with wild type root hairs . as noted distinct qualitative and quantitative differences in f actin organization in cells of the root elongation zone were observed between wild type and seedlings but only when treated with nm latb . we therefore evaluated f actin dynamics in root hairs where growth differences between the wild type and appeared to be more pronounced . in wild type seedlings the majority of the actively elongating root hairs were characterized by a distinct enrichment of fine and dynamic meshwork of f actin at the extreme apex . in root hairs the tip focused fine meshwork of f actin was not always observed and in cases where it was present it would often dissipate rapidly . similar results were obtained with wild type and root hairs _PROTEIN_ the f actin marker _PROTEIN_ lifeact _METHOD_ which was previously reported to clearly label apical f actin meshwork at the apex of pollen tubes and moss protonema . using a oil immersion objective on the spinning disc confocal microscope wild type root hairs _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ lifeact _METHOD_ had distinct filamentous meshwork at the tip that would often dissipate in the tips of root hairs . f actin tip dynamics in the wild type and were quantified from min time lapse movies of growing roots hairs by obtaining the ratio of the total time where the apical meshwork of f actin was clearly visible to the total time elapsed . this ratio provided an indication of the percentage of time that the root hair was able to _PROTEIN_ its tip focused fine meshwork of f actin as it elongated . these analyses showed that root hairs had a significantly lower ratio value than the wild type indicating that the mutant largely failed to _PROTEIN_ its tip focused fine meshwork of f actin . we also asked whether mutants had any measureable differences in global f actin dynamics when compared with the wild type . global f actin dynamics was quantified from time lapse movie sequences obtained from a spinning disc confocal microscope using the metrics of pixel difference and correlation values developed earlier . for this type of analysis we focused our imaging on cortical f actin in root epidermal cells in the mature zone and the center of growing root hairs because cells in these areas of the root stayed within the same field of view during the entire min time lapse sequence . time lapse data sets from epidermal cells of the root transition or elongation zone were significantly displaced as the primary root grew in the medium and therefore were not suitable for the global f actin analysis described here . based on changes in pixel difference and correlation coefficient decay there were no dramatic differences in global f actin dynamics between the wild type and . because attempts to identify the mutation responsible for the phenotype by standard thermal asymmetric interlaced pcr were unsuccessful we conducted map based cloning to identify the _PROTEIN_ gene . we found that the _PROTEIN_ gene had a bp deletion in the first exon corresponding to amino acid in the mutant . this frameshift mutation resulted in a premature stop codon at amino acid which may possibly lead to a truncated protein . to confirm whether loss of _PROTEIN_ corresponds to we searched the publicly available salk collection for t dna insertions in the _PROTEIN_ gene . we genotyped the segregating progeny by pcr and identified homozygous plants for three salk lines which had insertions in the exon the intron and the intron of _PROTEIN_ respectively . seedlings of these three t dna insertion mutants exhibited similar hypersensitivity to latb and root hair growth defects as indicating that these were mutant alleles of . the original mutant was designated as whereas and were named and respectively . the average primary root length was significantly less than that of the wild type only in which had an insertion in an exon suggesting that and are weaker alleles . the mutant allele was used for the analyses detailed below . further evidence showing that is linked to _PROTEIN_ was obtained from functional complementation of by _PROTEIN_ of an _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein that restored the wild type phenotype . _PROTEIN_ encodes a amino acid protein of unknown function . we analyzed _PROTEIN_ homologs from plant species to understand their phylogenetic relationship . phylogenetic relationships were inferred by the maximum likelihood method using software . based on this analysis _PROTEIN_ appears to be well conserved across the land plant lineage . sequence alignment of _PROTEIN_ homologs from six plant species representing moss monocots and eudicots showed that _PROTEIN_ has a highly variable n terminus six tetratricopeptide repeat motifs and a well conserved c terminus predicted to form a helical structure . the conservation of amino acids at the c terminus of several plant _PROTEIN_ proteins suggests that _PROTEIN_ has functional domains that have yet to be characterized . including _PROTEIN_ the arabidopsis genome has proteins containing a total of tpr motifs that are predicted to function in a range of biological processes and localize to a variety of subcellular compartments . however _PROTEIN_ has no paralogs among any of the tpr motif containing arabidopsis proteins indicating that it exists as a single gene . furthermore _PROTEIN_ is specific to land plants as no homologous sequences were identified in fungi and animals . tpr domains mediate protein protein interactions and proteins containing these domains are part of protein complexes with diverse functions including transcriptional repression protein import heat shock and cell cycle regulation . tpr domain containing proteins in plants have been implicated in responses to various hormones assembly of the photosynthetic machinery _LOCATION_ partitioning and root development . _PROTEIN_ fusions to _METHOD_ under the control of the native _PROTEIN_ promoter _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and the camv promoter _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ were generated to gain more insight into _PROTEIN_ function . both _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ complemented the latb hypersensitive and root hair phenotypes of in young seedlings indicating that the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein fusions are functional . confocal microscopy of cells from the elongation zone and root hairs of seedlings _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ revealed that the fusion protein localized to the cytoplasm and decorated distinct and dynamic foci . the _METHOD_ bodies decorated by _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were reminiscent of those observed in plant cells _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ tagged compartments of the endomembrane system . endomembrane compartments such as endosomes visualized with _METHOD_ have been shown to form large intracellular _METHOD_ agglomerates when treated with the fungal metabolite brefeldin a . consistent with the hypothesis that the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ bodies were associated with the endomembrane system seedlings _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ treated with bfa for h developed intracellular _METHOD_ agglomerates . to determine the identity of the endomembrane compartment with which _PROTEIN_ is associated _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ lines were crossed with a set of marker lines _PROTEIN_ mcherry and _METHOD_ endomembrane markers . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ overlapped substantially with the tgn markers mcherry _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and an early/recycling endosomal marker mcherry _PROTEIN_ but not with the _LOCATION_ marker mcherry . although the bodies decorated by _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and mcherry were clearly distinct many _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ bodies were adjacent to the larger _LOCATION_ bodies and often moved alongside _LOCATION_ stacks a feature typical of tgn dynamics . a number of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ bodies were also observed to move independently of mcherry . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ did not overlap substantially with mcherry _PROTEIN_ a marker for the _PROTEIN_ endosomes/prevacuolar compartment . the extent of colocalization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ with selected endomembrane markers was quantified by extracting pearson s correlation coefficients from scatterplots of green red image pairs . the pearson s correlation coefficient was higher in the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ mcherry _PROTEIN_ pair when compared with the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ mcherry _PROTEIN_ pair . the higher value for the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ mcherry _PROTEIN_ pair indicates that _PROTEIN_ foci are associated more closely with the _PROTEIN_ resident tgn/ee population and to a lesser extent with recycling endosomes decorated by _PROTEIN_ . lower pearson s correlation coefficients were obtained from the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ mcherry _PROTEIN_ pair consistent with visual observations of minimal overlap between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ endosomes/pvc . together these data strongly support the conclusion that _PROTEIN_ is a tgn/ee localized protein . as noted above _PROTEIN_ contains six tpr motifs and a conserved c terminal domain of unknown function . to determine whether these domains target _PROTEIN_ to the tgn/ee we generated _METHOD_ fusions to truncated _PROTEIN_ where either the six tpr motifs _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ or the conserved c terminus _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was deleted . when _PROTEIN_ in seedlings the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion that had the intact tpr motifs localized exclusively to the cytoplasm . by contrast the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ with the conserved c terminus localized to both the cytoplasm and tgn/ee bodies similar to the localization of full length _PROTEIN_ . taken together the data indicate that the c terminus of _PROTEIN_ is responsible for its localization to the tgn/ee . given that the mutant is hypersensitive to latb we tested the association of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ tgns with f actin in planta . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ plants were crossed with plants _PROTEIN_ the red _METHOD_ f actin construct _PROTEIN_ mcherry mcherry . it was difficult to obtain clear images of mcherry mcherry and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ bodies together in root cells that were highly cytoplasmic because the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ cytoplasmic component would often obscure the red f actin label . thus imaging of mcherry mcherry and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was conducted on vacuolated epidermal cells of the root maturation zone and fully mature root hairs where signal from the cytoplasm was minimal . in these cell types _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ bodies aligned with and tracked along f actin bundles in a beads on a string like localization typical of actin _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ such as the net proteins which are associated with the actin _LOCATION_ in vivo . the increased sensitivity of to latb prompted us to ask whether the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ bodies _METHOD_ responded to latb treatment . we found that roots of seedlings formed intracellular _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ agglomerates within min of latb application . however other tgn markers including _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ formed similar aggregates as _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ after latb treatment indicating that the compound has a global effect on tgn distribution in root cells . bioinformatic analyses indicated that _PROTEIN_ is a highly conserved protein that did not diverge much during the split between eudicots and monocots . to test whether an _PROTEIN_ ortholog from a monocot could have similar functions as the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ the rice _PROTEIN_ gene _PROTEIN_ was cloned and a _METHOD_ construct was generated . the _METHOD_ fusion partially complemented the latb hypersensitive phenotype of arabidopsis but fully complemented its short primary root defects . furthermore _METHOD_ localized to the cytoplasm and labeled similar dynamic punctate bodies as the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in the mutant background . the partial complementation of by _METHOD_ and similar localization patterns as the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ supports the conclusion that the role of _PROTEIN_ in endomembrane traffic is likely conserved in land plants . because tpr domains are known to mediate protein protein interactions coimmunoprecipitation experiments were performed to identify proteins interacting with _PROTEIN_ using roots of seedlings complemented with the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ construct . seedlings _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ served as control plants . _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and its putative interactors were coimmunoprecipitated using anti _METHOD_ serum . coimmunoprecipitated proteins from _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ seedlings were analyzed with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and the components were identified by _METHOD_ _METHOD_ based proteomic analysis . peptides corresponding to both _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ were readily detected in the coimmunoprecipitates from the roots of the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ line indicating successful isolation of chimeric _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ from the root extracts . two independent co ip experiments were conducted and proteins present in _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ immunoprecipitates but not in _METHOD_ controls were considered for further analyses . surprisingly the first co ip experiment yielded a limited number of proteins with only proteins unique to _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . by contrast the second co ip experiment yielded proteins unique to _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . it is unclear why there was a large discrepancy in the protein list between two independent co ip experiments . in both co ip experiments however peptides of hopm a visualized endocytic trafficking _PROTEIN_ were detected as unique to _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ root extracts . to validate the results of the two co ip experiments a reciprocal co ip was conducted with root extracts of _METHOD_ . consistent with the possibility that interacts with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ peptides were identified in the immunoprecipitates of _METHOD_ but not in the _METHOD_ controls . has been previously shown to localize to the tgn/ee and function in endocytosis of pm proteins . therefore its connection to _PROTEIN_ was evaluated in more detail . genetic and pharmacological evidence that is biologically relevant to _PROTEIN_ function was obtained from analyses of mutants which we refer to here as _PROTEIN_ for simplicity . roots of the _PROTEIN_ mutant were hypersensitive to latb as much as . even in the absence of latb _PROTEIN_ had short primary roots and root hairs mirroring phenotypes . to determine if _PROTEIN_ and colocalized in planta we generated an _PROTEIN_ mcherry fusion and _PROTEIN_ it in plants harboring _METHOD_ . spinning disc confocal microscopy observations followed by quantitative colocalization analyses revealed that _PROTEIN_ mcherry bodies overlapped significantly with _METHOD_ foci providing support to our co ip results that the two proteins indeed interact in vivo . a mutant allele of _PROTEIN_ was isolated from a confocal microscopy based forward genetic screen for defects in the internalization of the _PROTEIN_ formed _PROTEIN_ pm localized auxin efflux carriers . _PROTEIN_ was found to be defective in endocytic trafficking as it had diminished ability to form _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ agglomerates when treated with bfa . because _PROTEIN_ mirrored the latb hypersensitivity and root hair phenotypes of we hypothesized that could also have defects in the formation of intracellular _PROTEIN_ agglomerates when exposed to bfa . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was therefore _PROTEIN_ in and treated with bfa . like wild type roots roots accumulated intracellular _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ agglomerates after h exposure to bfa . although the number of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ agglomerates per cell in and the wild type was not statistically different _METHOD_ of bfa induced agglomerates was more intense in compared with the wild type when imaged under similar confocal microscopy settings . the stronger _METHOD_ intensity of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ agglomerates in prompted us to ask whether the mutation might be affecting the recycling of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ to the pm . to address this question bfa washout experiments were conducted on wild type and seedlings _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . after to h of bfa washout the number of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ agglomerates in wild type roots _PROTEIN_ significantly whereas those in the mutant background persisted . the _PROTEIN_ trafficking phenotypes observed in were surprisingly opposite to those reported for _PROTEIN_ but strikingly similar to those described for a class of dominant _LOCATION_ trafficking mutants called bex . in addition to the persistence of _PROTEIN_ agglomerates after bfa washout and _PROTEIN_ mutants formed intracellular _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ agglomerates in response to low concentrations of bfa whereas the wild type showed only minor agglomerate formation . seedlings _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were therefore treated with bfa for and h to determine if trafficking defects mirrored those reported for and _PROTEIN_ . consistent with previous studies bfa induced only minor intracellular accumulation of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in wild type seedlings . by contrast roots exposed to bfa for the same time periods as the wild type showed significant formation of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ agglomerates that were reminiscent of the bex mutants . taken together the data indicate that _PROTEIN_ functions in protein recycling to the pm . because is hypersensitive to latb and the actin _LOCATION_ has been implicated in the intracellular trafficking of _PROTEIN_ proteins we hypothesized that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ recycling in the background could also exhibit heightened sensitivity to concentrations of latb that only minimally affected _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ recycling in the wild type . to test this hypothesis the wild type and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were treated with nm latb . at this latb concentration _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in roots of the wild type formed a few weakly fluorescing intracellular _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ agglomerates within h of exposure to the drug . on the other hand roots of seedlings formed bright and numerous _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ intracellular agglomerates that were reminiscent of bfa induced _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ bodies . these results indicate that the recycling of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ to the pm in is more sensitive to latb compared with the wild type and consistent with the heightened response of its roots and f actin structures to the chemical . we next asked if the localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was altered in root cells without bfa or latb treatment . live cell microscopy and corresponding quantitative analyses showed that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signal in the background was higher in the pm and in the cell interior compared with the wild type when imaged with similar confocal microscopy settings . the stronger _METHOD_ in the cell interior of root cells was due to brighter and more distinct _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ foci . the more intense _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signals in the pm and cell interior of roots was reminiscent of observations made in _PROTEIN_ which showed similar _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ recycling defects as . given the defects in _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ recycling in we asked whether the distribution of a tgn/ee marker was altered in the mutant . to address this question we _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in the background . the distribution of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ foci in peripheral root cap cells was similar in the wild type and . furthermore global analyses of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ dynamics in root hairs revealed no appreciable differences between the wild type and . because we established that is an _PROTEIN_ interactor at the tgn/ee we also looked at the distribution of _METHOD_ in the background . unfortunately lines _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in and the wild type were extensively silenced and we could observe _METHOD_ signal only from cells in the peripheral root cap . like _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ the distribution of _METHOD_ in these cells was similar between the wild type and . although we did not detect any substantial differences between the wild type and with _PROTEIN_ to _PROTEIN_ or distribution at the light microscope level we can not discount the possibility that tgn/ee ultrastructure might be affected in the mutant as has been reported in _PROTEIN_ . because conspicuous differences between the wild type and were noted with _PROTEIN_ to _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ intensity in the pm and cell interior we next asked if displayed any _PROTEIN_ like phenotypes in _PROTEIN_ to seedling root development . consistent with previous reports _PROTEIN_ seedlings had distinct root agravitropic defects as evident from their high deviation from vertical growth . by contrast the deviation from vertical growth of roots was similar to the wild type . moreover although the deviation from vertical growth of _PROTEIN_ roots appeared to be enhanced by latb their primary roots exhibited wild type growth sensitivity to latb . root deviation from vertical growth of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ was similar to and the wild type . these data indicate that the _PROTEIN_ resident tgn complex is not required for full functionality of _PROTEIN_ . because _PROTEIN_ recycling is defective in and post _LOCATION_ traffic of some _PROTEIN_ proteins is a crucial component of the root gravitropic response we next asked whether roots were compromised in gravitropism . seedlings of the wild type and with roots growing vertically were rotated by degrees and the kinetics of root curvature was monitored at various time points for a h period . no measureable differences in root gravitropic response between wild type and seedlings under our growth conditions were noted . the impaired trafficking of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ to the pm in could be due to defects in protein secretion or recycling . we therefore _PROTEIN_ the secreted _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion a bulk flow secretion reporter in to determine whether the mutant has defects in constitutive secretion _METHOD_ . we first examined _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in actively elongating root hairs because the tips of these cell types are characterized by active secretion and the most obvious growth and f actin organizational defects of seedlings were observed in root hairs . using spinning disc confocal microscopy we found that growing root hairs of the wild type had intense _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ at the extreme tip . by contrast most root hairs had weak _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ at the tip or failed to _PROTEIN_ a distinct tip focused _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ gradient . the tip focused _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ gradient was quantified by obtaining the ratio of the average _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ at the tip apex to the average _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ at the subapex from min time lapse movie sequences . we found that ratio values at every s time point were higher in the wild type compared with verifying our visual observations that secretion in root hair tips of is altered . furthermore retention of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in the _LOCATION_ appeared to be more pronounced in cotyledons compared with the wild type . however like in the wild type strong _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was still observed in the apoplast of various cell types of seedlings . taken together our results indicate that bulk flow secretion in is only partially affected a defect that is most strongly manifested in growing root hairs which have measurable f actin defects . the localization of _PROTEIN_ to the tgn/ee suggests that other post _LOCATION_ trafficking pathways such as trafficking to the _LOCATION_ might be affected in the mutant . to address this question we _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ afvy a fusion to the c terminal of phaseolin that accumulates in the _LOCATION_ lumen . because _METHOD_ afvy was strongly silenced in root cells we focused our analyses on hypocotyls and cotyledons . we found that _METHOD_ afvy in hypocotyl and cotyledon epidermal cells of seedlings appeared to be mis sorted to the apoplast . mis sorting of _METHOD_ afvy was quantified by obtaining the ratio of _METHOD_ from a fixed region of the apoplast to an equivalent area within the _LOCATION_ lumen in epidermal cells of the hypocotyl . the higher ratio values for compared with the wild type support that _METHOD_ afvy is mis sorted in the mutant . however _METHOD_ afvy still accumulated in the _LOCATION_ lumen of several cell types in similar to the wild type indicating that _LOCATION_ targeting defects in the mutant are only partial . other evidence showing that trafficking to the _LOCATION_ in is not completely compromised was obtained from incubating wild type and seedlings _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in the dark for h. under such conditions _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in the wild type was shown to accumulate in lytic _LOCATION_ . here we observed that both the wild type and accumulated _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in lytic _LOCATION_ in the dark . in addition the styryl dye labeled the tonoplast in elongating root cells of light grown seedlings indicating that trafficking to the _LOCATION_ can still proceed in the mutant . labeling of root cells in the elongation zone and dic microscopy of peripheral root cap cells also did not reveal dramatic differences in _LOCATION_ morphology between the wild type and . however the possibility that there are subtle differences in _LOCATION_ dynamics and morphology between the wild type and can not be ruled out . furthermore differences in _LOCATION_ morphology between the wild type and could be more apparent in other cell types or amplified under certain growth conditions . as noted above it was previously shown that _PROTEIN_ had reduced intracellular accumulation of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ following treatment with bfa a phenotype opposite to that of . the opposite trafficking phenotypes of _PROTEIN_ and were surprising given their similar root developmental phenotypes and latb hypersensitivity . to better understand the genetic relationship between and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutants were generated and their phenotypes were compared with and _PROTEIN_ single mutants . the extent of hypersensitivity of _PROTEIN_ double mutants to latb was similar to single and _PROTEIN_ mutants . furthermore root hair length of _PROTEIN_ in the absence of latb was slightly shorter than single mutants but similar to _PROTEIN_ single mutants . in addition _PROTEIN_ had slightly shorter primary roots in latb free media compared with and _PROTEIN_ single mutants . we next asked how trafficking of pm markers is affected in _PROTEIN_ double mutants compared with and _PROTEIN_ single mutants . for these assays we used the endocytic styryl tracer dye . consistent with the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ assays in the wild type and formed _METHOD_ agglomerates after a h treatment with bfa . also in agreement with the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ assays was the observation that agglomerates persisted in compared with the wild type after bfa washout . by contrast _PROTEIN_ had diminished accumulation of agglomerates after bfa treatment in agreement with previous reports . in _PROTEIN_ accumulation was diminished to a similar extent as _PROTEIN_ single mutants . the similar latb hypersensitive response and root growth defects of _PROTEIN_ to single and _PROTEIN_ mutants indicate that and _PROTEIN_ function in common genetic pathways . because _PROTEIN_ trafficking and root hair defects mirrored those of the _PROTEIN_ single mutant _PROTEIN_ likely functions upstream of . another phenotype reported for _PROTEIN_ seedlings is their hypersensitivity to growth on moderate concentrations of bfa . given that both _PROTEIN_ and phenocopied each other in _PROTEIN_ to root development and hypersensitivity to latb the response of to bfa was examined . consistent with previous reports _PROTEIN_ seedlings displayed heightened sensitivity to low doses of bfa compared with the wild type . by contrast seedlings showed wild type sensitivity to bfa . furthermore seedlings of the _PROTEIN_ double mutant displayed similar hypersensitivity to bfa compared to seedlings of _PROTEIN_ single mutants providing additional genetic evidence that _PROTEIN_ functions upstream of .
an arabidopsis thaliana activation tagged t dna seed stock from the _PROTEIN_ was sterilized in ethanol and bleach according to citation . sterilized seeds were suspended in an autoclaved solution of murashige and skoog _METHOD_ medium supplemented with sucrose nm latb and agar after the solution had cooled to . the seed suspension was gently swirled in a ml _LOCATION_ flask to disperse the seeds uniformly and poured into cm square petri plates before the agar solidified . petri dishes were left at for d and transferred to a growth chamber with light intensity supplied with _METHOD_ bulbs and set to a h light and h dark cycle . temperature in the chamber was _PROTEIN_ at while keeping plates in a vertical position . after to d seedlings with severely inhibited primary root growth were selected . primary root growth of the progeny of selected seedlings was compared with the wild type on a range of latb concentrations . homozygous was crossed to the landsberg _LOCATION_ ecotype and seedlings were selected based on their enhanced sensitivity to nm latb . simple sequence length polymorphism and cleavage of amplified polymorphic site markers were used to map to a kb region on the lower arm of chromosome . dna was extracted from root tissue of week old seedlings by grinding in liquid nitrogen with a mortar and pestle followed by mixing with an equal volume of plant dnazol reagent and chloroform . after precipitation with ethanol dna was washed multiple times and then dissolved in water . full length genomic dna of various genes in the kb region was sequenced and compared with the arabidopsis reference genome until the bp deletion was found in _PROTEIN_ . three salk lines with predicted insertions in _PROTEIN_ were obtained from _PROTEIN_ and genotyped to ensure homozygosity using the following primers _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . the primer pair used for was the same as . one salk line with a predicted exon insertion in _PROTEIN_ was obtained from _PROTEIN_ . homozygous _PROTEIN_ mutants were isolated using the following primers and . working solutions of latb bfa cytochalasin b and d _PROTEIN_ indole acetic acid and naphthaleneacetic acid were diluted from stock solutions in _METHOD_ . working solutions of sodium chloride and mannitol were prepared directly from solids from the manufacturer s containers . seedling growth assays were conducted by transplanting to d old seedlings grown on solid onto _METHOD_ medium supplemented with the various chemicals . seedlings were grown vertically for an additional to d after transplanting in a h light and h dark cycle or in complete darkness in a growth chamber set to . in another set of experiments d old seedlings with straight primary roots were transplanted on new petri plates with _METHOD_ medium . after h of vertical growth plates were reoriented by degrees and primary roots were photographed every hour for h. images of seedlings were captured using a digital camera mounted on a copy stand or an stereomicroscope . hypocotyl primary root and root hair lengths and root curvature were measured using the image j software . the to d old wild type and seedlings _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were incubated on bfa or latb diluted with _METHOD_ medium on welled plates for various time periods and mounted on glass slides prior to imaging with a leica tcs _PROTEIN_ confocal scanning laser microscope _METHOD_ . for endocytic assays a working solution of was prepared in _METHOD_ medium from a mm aqueous solution . after incubating for min in liquid _METHOD_ medium to d old seedlings were pulse labeled with for min at room temperature . seedlings were then treated with bfa for h prior to confocal imaging . in a separate set of seedlings _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or pulse labeled with bfa was washed out by transferring seedlings to liquid _METHOD_ medium prior to imaging . the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ construct was generated from full length _PROTEIN_ gdna extracted from roots of week old wild type arabidopsis seedlings using the plant dnazol reagent . full length _PROTEIN_ gdna including bp immediately preceding the start codon was amplified using the following primers _PROTEIN_ f xmai and _PROTEIN_ r xmai . the product was cloned into a modified vector as described . _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was generated from full length _PROTEIN_ cdna amplified using the following primers _PROTEIN_ f ncoi and _PROTEIN_ r spei . the resulting product was digested with ncoi and spei and cloned into a modified vector behind the camv promoter driving _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ . to generate the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion a truncated _PROTEIN_ cdna fragment from position to bp was amplified using the primers _PROTEIN_ f ncoi and _PROTEIN_ r spei and the resulting product was digested with ncoi and spei and cloned into a modified vector . similarly the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion was created by first amplifying _PROTEIN_ cdna from position to bp with the following primers _PROTEIN_ f ncoi and _PROTEIN_ r spei . this fragment was digested with ncoi and spei and cloned into a modified vector to created _PROTEIN_ . next an _PROTEIN_ cdna fragment was amplified from position to bp with the following primers _PROTEIN_ f spei and _PROTEIN_ r pmli . this fragment was digested with spei and pmli and cloned into the _PROTEIN_ construct . the _METHOD_ construct was generated by amplifying full length cdna with the primers f sali and r ecori _PROTEIN_ . the product was digested with sali and ecori and again cloned into a modified vector . constructs were introduced into via agrobacterium tumefaciens mediated transformation using the floral dip method . seedlings _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were crossed with various red or cyan emitting marker lines . the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ mcherry _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ mcherry _PROTEIN_ mcherry _PROTEIN_ mcherry _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ mcherry mcherry _METHOD_ _METHOD_ afvy and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ lines were described previously . to generate the _PROTEIN_ lifeact _METHOD_ construct _METHOD_ with the bp lifeact sequence directly upstream was amplified from plasmid dna described by citation using the following primers lifeact f ecori and lifeact r spei . the resulting product was digested with ecori and spei and cloned behind the _PROTEIN_ promoter in a modified vector . five day old seedlings coexpressing _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and various red or cyan emitting markers were imaged with a leica confocal microscope or perkin elmer ultraview _LOCATION_ spinning disc confocal microscope . for quantification of f actin and tgn/ee dynamics images of epidermal cells in the root maturation zone or root hairs growing along the bottom of mm cover slips coated with _METHOD_ medium in agar were captured every to s for to min with a perkin elmer spinning disc confocal microscope equipped with a zeiss c apochromat water or a oil immersion objective . percentage of occupancy of f actin was determined using the algorithm described by citation . prior to applying the higaki algorithm single cells from the root elongation zone were converted into binary images and filaments skeletonized by software that was developed using matlab as described . intensity of bfa agglomerates was obtained using custom software written in matlab . the original images from the confocal microscope were first converted to gray scale and separated into layers by intensity values from zero to maximum and a binary image was created . the circle hough transform method was used to trace areas occupied by bfa and latb induced _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or agglomerates in the binary images . the average intensity in grayscale images in each of marked agglomerate was calculated . from the same set of images used to calculate agglomerate _METHOD_ intensity the number of agglomerates per cell was manually counted . quantification and statistical analyses of global f actin and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ dynamics were conducted following the methods of citation and citation using images of root epidermal cells and root hairs from at least time lapse movie sequences . to adopt the method used for global analysis of f actin to dynamics of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ foci in root hairs we first created an algorithm that utilized the hough transform method to detect individual organelles from binary images obtained from time lapse movies . this algorithm allowed us to set a threshold so that _METHOD_ originating from the cytoplasm was excluded from our analysis . to quantify _METHOD_ in the pm and cell interior of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ root cells we created another algorithm . after converting images to gray scale binary images were generated after separating the image into layers and classifying the layers based on their intensity values . this allowed us to separate _METHOD_ of the pm from the cell interior where the white area in the binary image corresponded to pm signals and the black area corresponded to the cell interior . _METHOD_ intensity was calculated by accumulating the intensity value of each pixel from the pm and cell interior . to quantify the extent of colocalization between _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and other mcherry tagged tgn/ee markers spinning disc confocal images were first thresholded using the volocity quantitation software . the colocalization function of volocity allows automated thresholding and statistical analyses of red and green channels according to the methods of citation and citation . from the colocalization menu of volocity quantitation a region of interest representing a single cell was selected and from generated scatterplots pearson s correlation coefficient values were calculated . to deduce phylogeny of _PROTEIN_ sequences for homologous proteins from species were obtained from genbank . the amino acid sequences were aligned by muscle algorithm and unreliable sequences with confidence score lower than were removed . the alignment is available as supplemental data set . subsequent phylogenetic analyses were conducted in based on the maximum likelihood method . a _PROTEIN_ of pairwise distances was estimated by the jtt model and the tree with the highest log likelihood was chosen with the neighbor join and bionj algorithm . a discrete gamma distribution was used to model evolutionary rate differences among sites . all positions with < site coverage were eliminated . to find tpr containing proteins the arabidopsis genome was scanned with tprpred . the resulting proteins were compared against the conserved domain database . the arabidopsis proteins were identified to have more than one tpr motifs . predicated subcellular localization for the tpr proteins was obtained from the subcellular proteome database and presented in supplemental data set . co ip experiments were conducted using the pierce classic ip kit . briefly proteins were extracted by grinding roots of week old arabidopsis seedlings _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ in liquid nitrogen . the fine powder was then mixed with extraction/wash solution supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail by vortexing . the protein extracts were centrifuged at for min at . the supernatant was mixed with control resin via end over end shaking in a ml falcon tube for h at . the mixture was then added to a spin column and centrifuged at for s at . rabbit anti _METHOD_ monoclonal antibody _PROTEIN_ was added to the cleared protein lysate and mixed by end over end shaking overnight at . protein a/g plus agarose resin was then added and allowed to mix for h at . the mixture was again added to a spin column and centrifuged at for s at . the columns were washed five times with extraction/wash solution and then one time with conditioning buffer . the proteins were eluted by adding nonreducing lane marker sample buffer with mm dtt and heating for min at . once cooled the columns were placed inside eppendorf tubes and centrifuged at for s at . composition of the eluent was analyzed by tandem _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . briefly the samples were digested with trypsin overnight at . the resulting peptides were dried and redissolved in acetonitrile with trifluoroacetic acid . the peptides were resolved with thermo easy column ionized with thermo easy spray and then analyzed with a thermo q exactive quadrupole orbitrap _METHOD_ spectrometer . the spectra were assigned to peptides using the _METHOD_ x ! tandem and x ! hunter _METHOD_ . sequence data from this article can be found in the
