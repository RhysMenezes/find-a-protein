the arabidopsis aaa _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was fused to cerulean _METHOD_ protein and yellow _METHOD_ protein . aaa _PROTEIN_ like _PROTEIN_ are only active in hexameric form . resonance energy transfer based _METHOD_ lifetime imaging microscopy using _PROTEIN_ cerulean _METHOD_ protein and _PROTEIN_ yellow _METHOD_ protein showed interaction between two adjacent protomers demonstrating homo oligomerization occurs in living plant cells . interaction between _PROTEIN_ and the _PROTEIN_ embryogenesis receptor like _PROTEIN_ transmembrane receptor occurs in very restricted domains at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . in these domains the predominant form of the _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ protein is a hexamer suggesting that _PROTEIN_ is associated with the active form of _PROTEIN_ in vivo . _PROTEIN_ trans phosphorylates _PROTEIN_ on ser . resonance energy transfer _METHOD_ lifetime imaging microscopy was used to show that in vivo the c terminal domains of _PROTEIN_ stay in close proximity . employing _METHOD_ correlation spectroscopy it was shown that _PROTEIN_ hexamers are part of larger complexes .
the _PROTEIN_ protein and various mutants used in this study are depicted in figure . _PROTEIN_ consists of the n domain the and domains connected by a linker and the c terminal tail . the _METHOD_ tag is shown here as a c terminal fusion and in appropriate constructs it was replaced by _METHOD_ and/or placed at the n terminus . the _PROTEIN_ mutant contains the and mutations in the walker a motifs of the and domains which inhibit _PROTEIN_ binding and in vitro severely delay hexamerization in the mammalian homolog . the n deletion _PROTEIN_ mutant lacks the n domain which in other homologs is responsible for binding to cofactors like _PROTEIN_ and ubiquitinated substrates . the _PROTEIN_ mutant lacks the domain and the linker region between and . the linker was shown to be important for hexamerization of vcp in vitro . to investigate whether the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ proteins are indeed capable of forming a hexameric complex the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and mutant genes were transiently _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis protoplasts and analyzed on denaturing and nondenaturing _PROTEIN_ . western blot analysis shows that in protoplasts the various proteins confirm the expected sizes of approximately kd for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ kd for _PROTEIN_ and kd for _PROTEIN_ . the estimated size of the full length _PROTEIN_ protein after native _PROTEIN_ is about to kd in line with the calculated size of to kd the difference depending on the number of _METHOD_ tags present . however about to of the _METHOD_ tagged protein appears to remain as monomers . surprisingly the _PROTEIN_ protein is also predominantly found as a hexamer on native _PROTEIN_ despite the mutations delaying hexamerization . in a longer exposure of the western blot _PROTEIN_ does show a monomeric protein fraction . _PROTEIN_ shows bands of various sizes but most prominently the monomeric band . in a study by wang and coworkers a vcp mutant lacking amino acids to of the n domain is still able to hexamerize in vitro . our data show that the _PROTEIN_ protein lacking the complete n domain is most likely in the monomeric form . the _PROTEIN_ protein runs as a monomer in line with the results presented by citation . to compare the localizations of the different _PROTEIN_ mutant proteins they were coexpressed with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ shown to localize solely to the _LOCATION_ . the localization of the _PROTEIN_ protein is at the pm in the cytoplasm and in the _LOCATION_ but a small fraction also was observed in the _LOCATION_ . in figure images of the _LOCATION_ of _PROTEIN_ are shown in the focal plane . _PROTEIN_ colocalizes with _PROTEIN_ in the _LOCATION_ and also localizes to the pm and the cytoplasm . the pm is not in the focal plane and can therefore not be seen . the merge shows an overlay of the cells containing chloroplasts in red _PROTEIN_ in yellow and the _LOCATION_ in cyan . the _PROTEIN_ protein is found in the cytoplasm but not in the _LOCATION_ . this can be explained by the tyr residue comparable to tyr in yeast _PROTEIN_ and shown to be required for _LOCATION_ translocation and that is present in the deleted part of _PROTEIN_ . apparently although the two _LOCATION_ localization signals are still present in the mutant these are not sufficient for _LOCATION_ targeting . a similar observation was made for the mammalian _PROTEIN_ ortholog vcp . to our surprise the _PROTEIN_ protein lacking the _LOCATION_ localization signal sequences still localizes to the _LOCATION_ . for vcp cytoplasmic localization was described when the n domain of the protein was removed and citation found that hexamerization of this protein in vitro could still take place . the _PROTEIN_ protein is found in the cytoplasm as well as in the _LOCATION_ . we conclude based on the hexamerization status in vitro and the localization of the mutant proteins in cells that complete hexamerization of _PROTEIN_ is not required for _LOCATION_ localization . to investigate if the _PROTEIN_ receptor interacts in vivo with the hexameric or the monomeric form of _PROTEIN_ the oligomerization of _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ fused _PROTEIN_ protomers in vivo was studied . the _PROTEIN_ protein was fused at the c terminus with _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis protoplasts . for the flim measurements _PROTEIN_ protomers c terminally fused to _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ were coexpressed hypothetically leading to a hexamer as shown in the model in figure . only four of the six fluorophores are drawn at adjacent positions at the c terminus but in _PROTEIN_ these can be randomly positioned at each c domain . the other combinations used are depicted in figure c to f. figure shows a hexamer with the donor at the c terminus and the acceptor at the n terminus figure shows a hexamer of _PROTEIN_ tagged to _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ and figure e and f shows a monomer of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ with tags only at the c terminus . a maximum energy transfer efficiency of around can only be achieved when fluorophores are approximately nm apart . the distance between two adjacent c termini is not known but the inner pore diameter of the hexamer is nm based on the crystal structure of . interaction not only between two adjacent fluorophores but also between two fluorophores on either side of the pore should therefore theoretically be possible . to measure significant energy transfer the amount of labeled protein has to be relatively high as compared to the amount of endogenous _PROTEIN_ . based on the previous observation that in transfected protoplasts the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ level is around times higher than the endogenous level we assume that in a hexamer most of the _PROTEIN_ protomers contain a _METHOD_ tag . first we investigated if at the locations where _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ interaction takes place also oligomerization of the _PROTEIN_ proteins occurs . in figure the intensity image of the donor molecule _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ is shown . in the false color image the average lifetime at the pm is shown to be approximately to ns . as reported previously coexpression of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ resulted in a reduction of the _METHOD_ lifetime in a punctuate pattern at the _LOCATION_ . part of the areas where _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ interacted colocalized with an _LOCATION_ marker but not with an endocytic marker . after coexpression of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ interaction was found in a comparable but more widespread area at the pm . we therefore propose that in those _LOCATION_ areas where interaction between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ occurs a substantial amount of _PROTEIN_ is in oligomeric form . in table i the results of all the measurements are listed . in the top portion the average lifetimes of the full length _PROTEIN_ proteins are listed in the middle portion the lifetimes of the monomeric mutant _PROTEIN_ and in the lower portion the lifetimes of _PROTEIN_ . the left side refers to the measurements at the pm the right side refers to the measurements in the _LOCATION_ . the unquenched lifetime of the donor _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein is ns in the _LOCATION_ as well as at the pm . figure shows a false color image of the _LOCATION_ of a protoplast _PROTEIN_ only the donor molecule _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . in the left upper corner the corresponding intensity image is shown . fret flim analysis of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutant and _PROTEIN_ fused to _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ d diameter eff. efficiency . lifetime is determined as described in materials and methods. the distance d and the fret efficiency between the _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ fluorophores are calculated via equations and . n proteins are not localized in the _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ proteins not at the pm . a cr is _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ a cr/y a is _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ cr a/y a is _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ a cr/a y is _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ n cr is n _METHOD_ n cr/y is n _METHOD_ _METHOD_ cr c is _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ c cr/y c is _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ cr c/y c is _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and c cr/c y is _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . subsequently _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ tagged proteins were coexpressed . in figure an example of a false color image is shown for the _LOCATION_ . this combination shows a significant reduction in lifetime at the pm as well as in the _LOCATION_ . from the differences in lifetime between donor alone and donor plus acceptor the distance between the fluorophores can be calculated . the average distance between two fluorophores both at the c terminus is nm with a fret efficiency of . the distances between the n domains and c domains in the _PROTEIN_ protein as calculated from the crystal structure of the mammalian homolog are approximately nm which is just outside the range at which fret can be detected between two fluorophores . to determine this distance for the _PROTEIN_ protein a combination of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ . the mixed protomers showed a minor reduction in the _METHOD_ lifetime at the pm and ns in the _LOCATION_ . based on the fret efficiencies between the _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ fluorophores the estimated distance between the n terminus and c terminus using equations and is between nm and nm _LOCATION_ which is in agreement with the estimated value for of nm . the crystal structure of also showed that at the plane of the n domains the hexameric protein has a diameter of approximately nm . therefore _METHOD_ molecules at opposite positions in _PROTEIN_ can not show fret so any interaction resulting in a reduction in lifetime would have to originate from adjacent protomers . _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ proteins were coexpressed and the _METHOD_ lifetimes were compared with the donor . no significant reduction in lifetime was measured at the pm or in the _LOCATION_ . the distance between the n domains is calculated to be between nm and nm _LOCATION_ again confirming the structure as determined for . the fret efficiency is only meaning that there is no interaction at all . the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ combination did not show a reduction in the _METHOD_ lifetime compared to the donor alone . the fret efficiency was only confirming the monomeric nature of this mutant and demonstrating the importance of the linker and/or the domain in the oligomerization . in general the reduction in lifetime between the donor group _METHOD_ alone and the donor plus the acceptor group _METHOD_ was less in the _LOCATION_ than in the pm . the reason for differences in lifetimes at the pm or in the _LOCATION_ of the same protein could be due to the difference in refractive indices of the environment . to confirm the relevance of our protein protein distance measurements using fret flim we next investigated the characteristics of _PROTEIN_ another member of the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ family that in contrast with _PROTEIN_ is only present in the _LOCATION_ . based on the presence of walker a and b motifs _PROTEIN_ is classified as an aaa _PROTEIN_ as well and therefore the same hexameric structure is expected . the average donor lifetime of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was . the combination of _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ showed a lifetime of ns a significant reduction compared to the donor alone . the fret efficiency was . the combination of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ protomers also showed a minor but significant reduction in lifetime comparable with the same combination for _PROTEIN_ . coexpressed _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ proteins showed a large reduction in donor lifetime comparable to that of the _PROTEIN_ proteins . the distance between the fluorophores was nm with a fret efficiency of . when analyzing fret flim measurements average lifetimes are calculated from lifetime distributions in order to compare different combinations . however spatial distributions may be more illustrative for changes in interactions . in figure examples of lifetime distribution _METHOD_ at the pm are shown for _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ alone _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in combination with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and a combination of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ . these _METHOD_ are examples recorded from protoplasts displaying _METHOD_ lifetimes as in images figure b f and l respectively . the _LOCATION_ in image figure is surrounded by chlorophyll which has a very short lifetime and is indicated in a red color . these lifetimes were not taken into account in the _METHOD_ shown in figure and for the calculations of the average lifetimes . the lifetime distribution _METHOD_ clearly show the shift to lower lifetime values when _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were coexpressed while the lack of interaction between the n terminally placed _METHOD_ groups is also clearly reflected in the absence of a shift to lower lifetime values . for comparison of the various combinations of proteins combined distribution _METHOD_ of five representative experiments for each protein combination were plotted . taken together our observations show _METHOD_ proteins fused at the c terminus of _PROTEIN_ are within the maximal distance for measuring fret and do interact which is only possible when the protomers homo oligomerize and the c termini stay close together rather than protruding out of the molecule . this oligomerization takes place in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ based regions at the pm where _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ interaction takes place . a combination of _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ proteins shows no reduction in lifetime suggesting that the n domains of _PROTEIN_ in line with the mushroom like shape structure of are not within fret distance and can not interact . the n termini of _PROTEIN_ in contrast with _PROTEIN_ are within fret distance and do interact suggesting that the n terminal domains of _PROTEIN_ are differently organized and probably closer to each other . in previous work it was shown that _PROTEIN_ interacts both with the n domain as well as with the c terminus of _PROTEIN_ . to investigate if this interaction involves trans phosporylation of _PROTEIN_ by the _PROTEIN_ kinase an in vitro kinase experiment was performed . the _PROTEIN_ kinase domain and full length _PROTEIN_ were produced in escherichia coli as fusions to glutathione s transferase _PROTEIN_ purified and incubated with _PROTEIN_ . after incubation the mixture was analyzed by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and labeled proteins were detected with a phosphorimager . the _PROTEIN_ kinase domain is heavily autophosphorylated but also trans phosphorylates _PROTEIN_ . next the experiment was repeated with cold _PROTEIN_ . the kd _PROTEIN_ proteins were isolated from the gel digested with trypsin and the resulting peptides analyzed by liquid chromatography tandem _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . only in the sample containing the _PROTEIN_ kinase one phosphorylated ser residue was found at position of _PROTEIN_ which is located in the n domain . unfortunately we did not have any peptide coverage in the c terminal tail where three sers three thrs and one tyr are present so there may be additional targets for _PROTEIN_ phosphorylation . to investigate the size of _PROTEIN_ complexes in living cells _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ constructs were _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis protoplasts . fcs was used to measure the diffusion times of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ proteins _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in the cytoplasm close to the pm and in the _LOCATION_ . to estimate cellular viscosities via the stokes einstein equation the diffusion time of free _METHOD_ in cells was first measured . differences in the diffusion times of protein molecules can point to _METHOD_ differences between them and so the diffusion time of _PROTEIN_ in cells was measured . the results of the fcs measurements are based on nine independent transfections and summarized in table ii . in figure examples of autocorrelation curves are shown for _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and free _METHOD_ in the cytoplasm . mean of the diffusion constant d of various proteins measured by fcs in the cytoplasm and _LOCATION_ of protoplasts in the two sample t test comparing _PROTEIN_ with one of the other proteins the null hypothesis that the mean of the diffusion constants are the same is rejected when the absolute value of p is lower than the significance level and accepted when p is higher . values for d and rh were calculated via equations and . n is not _PROTEIN_ in the _LOCATION_ . sd is the sd of the d value n is the number of curves . first the diffusion time of free _METHOD_ in protoplasts was determined in the cytoplasm close to the pm and in the _LOCATION_ . the average values for the diffusion times for the cytoplasm and for the _LOCATION_ are listed in table ii . from the values of each curve the average diffusion coefficient d and the hydrodynamic radius rh were calculated . the diffusion coefficients can be directly compared because in contrast to the diffusion time the diffusion coefficient is independent of the structural parameter or the shape of the volume . the hydrodynamic radius rh is a measure for the size of the protein . the diffusion coefficient for free _METHOD_ in protoplasts was determined to be in the cytoplasm and in the _LOCATION_ . the calculated hydrodynamic radii were nm and nm close to the theoretical rh for free _METHOD_ of nm . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in cells diffuses extremely slowly . a diffusion coefficient of was found for _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in the cytoplasm . to answer whether this is due to the hexameric nature of the _PROTEIN_ protein the monomeric _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ mutant construct was also introduced into protoplasts . the diffusion coefficient of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was found to be which is clearly faster than the _PROTEIN_ full length protein . however based on the crystal structure for vcp _PROTEIN_ should have a rh of approximately nm instead of the calculated nm . therefore we hypothesized that the n domain which is considered to be the domain responsible for most of the interactions of _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ proteins like ufd and ubiquitinated proteins associated with some of these proteins in the full length _PROTEIN_ as well as in the monomeric _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . therefore we deleted the n domain from _PROTEIN_ and measured diffusion times of the mutant _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein . indeed the diffusion coefficient of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in the cytoplasm is significantly higher than that of _PROTEIN_ . this could be explained by the lack of the interactive n domain . unlike _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was not predominantly found in the hexameric form on native _PROTEIN_ which might also explain the faster diffusion of this mutant . the diffusion coefficient of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein the mutant which is reported to be severely delayed in hexamerization in vitro for was significantly higher than the diffusion coefficient of the _PROTEIN_ protein . native _PROTEIN_ showed that the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein in cells is predominantly in the hexameric form as well as _PROTEIN_ . although the oligomerization of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein was not tested in the fret flim experiments the fcs results suggest that fewer proteins associate with this mutant resulting in faster diffusion of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . this implies that inhibition of _PROTEIN_ binding also inhibits complex formation with other proteins . surprisingly no significant difference in diffusion coefficient between _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was measured in the _LOCATION_ . in general the diffusion coefficient in the _LOCATION_ was the same as in the cytoplasm for all proteins except for _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . the diffusion coefficient of _PROTEIN_ is much slower in the cytoplasm suggesting that in contrast with the situation in the _LOCATION_ the protein is bound to a larger or different complex . there is a discrepancy between the complex size estimated on native _PROTEIN_ and the size calculated from the fcs analysis . an explanation might be that the _PROTEIN_ complex is associated with _LOCATION_ or large molecules like the proteasome and therefore shows a very slow diffusion . for the native _PROTEIN_ procedure however _LOCATION_ are solubilized and connections of _LOCATION_ with protein complexes can be lost . from these data we propose that in vivo _LOCATION_ located _PROTEIN_ is found in larger protein complexes rather than in hexameric configuration only while the n domain could be responsible for the interactions that lead to these large complexes .
plasmid is a plant _PROTEIN_ vector that contains the enhanced cauliflower mosaic virus promoter followed by a multiple cloning site and the terminator of the nopaline synthase gene . this plasmid containing the cdna of _METHOD_ enhanced _METHOD_ or a fusion construct of _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ c terminally linked to _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ was used for transfection of protoplasts . also a mutant of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ was constructed the deletion mutant _PROTEIN_ missing the domain from to the end of the _PROTEIN_ sequence by restriction with ncoi and subsequent ligation of the template . a second mutant of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was constructed missing the n domain . using the quikchange xl site directed mutagenesis kit mutations and were introduced in the walker a motifs of the domain and the domain respectively . a combination of the two mutations in a fusion protein with either _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ resulted in the mutant . all constructs were checked by restriction enzyme analysis and the size of the protein was determined by western blotting . all constructs were verified by sequencing . protoplast isolation and transfection were performed as described before . fret flim was measured h after transfections . for fcs measurements a low amount of _METHOD_ molecules in the detection volume is essential therefore cells were measured h after transfections . arabidopsis mesophyll protoplasts were prepared and transfected according to a protocol described by citation with modifications as described before . sixteen to h after transfection protoplasts were lysed in ripa buffer for min on ice . extracts were centrifuged for min at rpm at and soluble fractions were supplemented with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ loading buffer denatured at for min before loading on an gel next to a prestained marker . gels were blotted on nitrocellulose . for native _PROTEIN_ the soluble fractions were supplemented with native _PROTEIN_ loading buffer and loaded on a native gel of to acrylamide . gels were blotted on pvdf _LOCATION_ . the marker part of the blot was stained with _METHOD_ immediately after blotting . anti _METHOD_ was generated by isogen according to standard procedure . the serum was purified on a _METHOD_ prota column . as a marker for native _PROTEIN_ a mixture of thyroglobuline ferritine and serum albumin was used . for the in vitro trans phosphorylation of _PROTEIN_ kd was added to of _PROTEIN_ in kinase buffer plus mm cold _PROTEIN_ and of _PROTEIN_ in a total reaction of . after incubation of min at sample buffer was added . the sample was heated for min at and loaded on _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . after drying the gel the radioactivity was detected with a phosphorimager using the imagequant program . for _METHOD_ analysis the in vitro phosphorylation was performed as described without _PROTEIN_ . the gel was not dried . the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ kd bands were excised from the gel after staining with the colloidal _METHOD_ staining kit and cut into mm pieces . in gel digestion was performed as described by citation . after destaining with water cys reduction and alkylation the gel pieces were washed three times with of mm and dried in a vacuum centrifuge . for proteolytic digestion the gel was treated overnight with trypsin . finally peptides were extracted from the gel pieces using to of trifluoroacetic acid in water followed by sonication for min . a second gel extraction was done using to acid/water mixture and sonication for min . extracted peptides were subjected to lc _METHOD_ analysis . each run with all spectra obtained was analyzed with bioworks . for identification of the peptides the following proteins were added to a database arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ trypsin trypsin _PROTEIN_ keratin and keratin . the searches were done allowing met oxidation and phosphorylation of ser thr and tyr . the peptide identifications obtained were analyzed with bioworks with the following filter criteria > xcorr > for charge state xcorr > for charge state and xcorr > for charge state as described previously . fret takes place when two proteins coupled to appropriate fluorophores are in close distance from each other . fret measurement is very sensitive since the rate of energy transfer is inversely proportional to the donor acceptor distance to the power of . fret can reveal distances between fluorophores that are typically in the range of to nm . flim is one method to measure fret by estimating the reduction of _METHOD_ donor lifetime in case of interaction with a _METHOD_ acceptor molecule . flim was performed on a bio rad radiance _PROTEIN_ system in combination with a nikon te inverted microscope as described by citation . from the _METHOD_ intensity image the _METHOD_ lifetime is determined for each pixel . the full _METHOD_ decay per pixel was calculated for the donor molecule using a double exponential decay model . the _METHOD_ lifetime can then be presented as a false color image . first the _METHOD_ lifetime of only the donor molecule was determined by analyzing all the measured pixels in the pm . the resulting average lifetime was subsequently used in the analysis where all decays were fit using two exponentials with one lifetime fixed to the value for of the donor . this two exponent model assumes two populations of donors one that does not have an acceptor nearby and therefore has the unquenched lifetime and one that has an acceptor near enough for energy transfer to occur and therefore has a reduced lifetime . _METHOD_ lifetime decays were fitted per pixel with a binning _PROTEIN_ of . a double exponential decay model was used with the lifetime of one component fixed to the value found for the unquenched lifetime of the donor . fits were judged by the values . the amount of photon counts in the peak channel was normally around . at least cells were measured for each combination and location in two to five independent experiments . after measurements the distribution _METHOD_ of five representative cells were combined and plotted for each combination of proteins . average lifetime per combination was determined and sds calculated . the distance between donor and acceptor were calculated via the following where e is the transfer efficiency r is the actual distance and is the radius indicating the distance where one observes fret efficiency . the for the fret pair _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ was determined to be nm based on the excitation and emission spectra of the in vitro produced proteins . fcs makes use of a focused laser beam continuously illuminating a sample . only the _METHOD_ from particles excited in a small observation volume is detected . the observation volume is defined by the focused laser beam in the x and y direction and by the pinhole in the z direction which makes monitoring of a subfemtoliter volume possible . the entrance of a fluorophore into this volume gives rise to a burst of detected photons . the duration of this burst reflects the time the particle needs to diffuse through the observation volume while the amplitude represents the molecular brightness . the intensity trace is correlated with itself at a _PROTEIN_ time point to yield the autocorrelation curve g from which the diffusion coefficient d and the average number of particles in the observation volume n can be obtained . fcs measurements were performed on a confocor lsm combination setup . the nm argon laser line was used to excite _METHOD_ . the system was calibrated with rhodamine green solution and aligned using a rhodamine film . the fcs observation volume was positioned in the cytoplasm adjacent to the pm to avoid measuring in chloroplasts . after a prebleach of s with high laser power three measurements of s each were performed with low laser power . fcs data were analyzed using fcs data processor . since measurements were performed in the cytoplasm we fit the data with a model assuming free diffusion of protein and protein complexes in three dimensions although interaction with the pm in some cases can not be ruled out . an additional triplet state term was used to describe the fast photophysics of _METHOD_ . here g is the autocorrelation function n is the number of molecules in the detection volume is the diffusion time of the molecules ftrip is the fraction of molecules in the triplet state and ttrip is the triplet state relaxation time . and are the equatorial radius and axial radius of the gaussian shaped observation volume respectively . the ratio is also called the structural parameter and was found to be between and in our measurements . the structural parameter was fixed to the value obtained with the rhodamine green solution . the diffusion constants were calculated from the value for each curve and listed in a table for the pm and the _LOCATION_ . ses on the d value were calculated and a two sample t test with significance was performed to compare the mean d value of _PROTEIN_ with the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants . the time a molecule on average spends in the observation volume is linked to the translational diffusion coefficient d by equation . the diffusion coefficient of a spherical particle is inversely proportional to the hydrodynamic radius rh according to the stokes einstein relation in which k is the boltzmann constant t is the absolute temperature and is the viscosity of the solution . assuming a globular particle the molecular _METHOD_ m is proportional to the hydrodynamic radius to the power of where is the mean density of the molecule and na is avogadro 's number . combination of equations and yields equation which shows that the diffusion constant scales only to the cubic root of the molecular _METHOD_ and is independent of the observation volume . hence the larger the molecule is the lower the diffusion constant . to distinguish particles of different size with fcs the diffusion times have to differ at least by a _PROTEIN_ of which corresponds to a fold _METHOD_ difference . sequence data from this article can be found in the genbank/embl data libraries under accession numbers or _GENE_ _PROTEIN_ and or _GENE_ _PROTEIN_ . the following materials are available in the online version of this article . supplemental figure . lifetime distributions of _PROTEIN_ .
