the function of the rab e subclass of plant rab _PROTEIN_ in _LOCATION_ traffic was investigated using a dominant inhibitory mutant _PROTEIN_ of arabidopsis thaliana _PROTEIN_ and in vivo imaging approaches that have been used to characterize similar mutants in the plant rab and rab subclasses . _PROTEIN_ inhibited the transport of a secreted green _METHOD_ protein marker _METHOD_ but in contrast with dominant inhibitory _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ mutants it did not affect the transport of _LOCATION_ or _LOCATION_ markers . quantitative imaging revealed that _PROTEIN_ caused less intracellular _METHOD_ accumulation than _PROTEIN_ a dominant inhibitory mutant of a member of the arabidopsis rab subclass . furthermore whereas _PROTEIN_ caused _METHOD_ to accumulate exclusively in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ caused _METHOD_ to accumulate additionally in the _LOCATION_ apparatus and a prevacuolar compartment that could be labeled by and yellow _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ tagged arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ . using the _LOCATION_ protease inhibitor d it was shown that some _METHOD_ was transported to the _LOCATION_ in control cells and in the presence of _PROTEIN_ . consistent with the hypothesis that _METHOD_ carries a weak _LOCATION_ sorting determinant it was shown that a secreted form of dsred reaches the apoplast without appearing in the prevacuolar compartment . when fused to _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was targeted specifically to the _LOCATION_ via a saturable nucleotide and prenylation dependent mechanism but was never observed on the prevacuolar compartment . we propose that _PROTEIN_ inhibits the secretory pathway at or after the _LOCATION_ causing an accumulation of _METHOD_ in the upstream compartments and an increase in the quantity of _METHOD_ that enters the _LOCATION_ pathway .
to investigate the trafficking functions of the plant rab e subclass we generated a dominant negative mutant allele of one member of the arabidopsis rab e subclass _PROTEIN_ . this mutant _PROTEIN_ carries a single amino acid substitution _PROTEIN_ to ile in the conserved _PROTEIN_ binding motif _PROTEIN_ . the corresponding substitution in many rab and other ras like _PROTEIN_ reduces affinity for nucleotide resulting in dominant negative alleles that have provided valuable information on the trafficking functions of the respective rab proteins in yeasts mammals and plants . the corresponding mutation in the yeast ortholog of rab has been extensively characterized and shown to be a specific dominant inhibitor of function in transport from the _LOCATION_ to pm and to interact with the nucleotide exchange _PROTEIN_ . the effect of _PROTEIN_ on biosynthetic _LOCATION_ traffic was analyzed in a transport assay previously used to characterize dominant mutants of arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and a tobacco syntaxin . this assay is based on a secreted green _METHOD_ protein marker _METHOD_ which is transported from the _LOCATION_ to the apoplast where it accumulates poorly and exhibits weak _METHOD_ . under conditions that inhibit biosynthetic traffic to the apoplast _METHOD_ _METHOD_ protein accumulates inside the cells and can be readily visualized in the endomembrane compartments . both the wild type and mutant cdnas of _PROTEIN_ were coexpressed with _METHOD_ by agrobacterium mediated transfection of tobacco lower epidermal cells as described previously . sixty five to h after infiltration _METHOD_ _METHOD_ intensity was examined by confocal laser scanning microscopy at low magnification . at this time control cells _PROTEIN_ only _METHOD_ exhibited very dim _METHOD_ in comparison with cells _PROTEIN_ an _LOCATION_ resident _METHOD_ marker _METHOD_ hdel . coexpression of _METHOD_ with a dominant inhibitory allele of arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ that has been shown to inhibit transport between the _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ apparatus resulted in an increase in _METHOD_ _METHOD_ owing to intracellular accumulation of _METHOD_ . when _METHOD_ was coexpressed with wild type _PROTEIN_ the _METHOD_ appeared to be unaltered relative to _METHOD_ alone suggesting that wild type _PROTEIN_ did not affect biosynthetic traffic of _METHOD_ under these conditions . by contrast in the presence of _PROTEIN_ a significant increase in _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and intracellular accumulation was detected . quantitative analysis of confocal images confirmed that tissues cotransfected with _PROTEIN_ had approximately five times the _METHOD_ intensity of tissues coexpressing _PROTEIN_ but approximately half the intensity measured in the presence of _PROTEIN_ . these data suggest that _PROTEIN_ inhibited _METHOD_ traffic but less efficiently than _PROTEIN_ . to establish whether or not _PROTEIN_ caused _METHOD_ to accumulate in the same compartments as _PROTEIN_ we examined tissues _PROTEIN_ each mutant at higher resolution by confocal laser scanning microscopy . in most epidermal cells of leaf tissues infiltrated with _METHOD_ alone _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was barely detectable but in a few cells _METHOD_ was seen either in the apoplast in a network interpreted as _LOCATION_ by comparison to _METHOD_ hdel or in unidentified mobile punctate structures in addition to the _LOCATION_ . in the presence of _PROTEIN_ however intracellular _METHOD_ appeared to have accumulated exclusively in the _LOCATION_ network as reported previously . by contrast in cells that accumulated most _METHOD_ in the presence of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was observed in numerous small mobile punctate structures of unknown identity in addition to the _LOCATION_ network . control cells _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ alone occasionally accumulated _METHOD_ _METHOD_ in the _LOCATION_ and in similar punctate structures . therefore to determine the effect of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants more precisely we counted the number of visibly _METHOD_ cells per field of view in tissues infiltrated with _METHOD_ alone or with _METHOD_ plus either _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ and determined the subcellular distribution of _METHOD_ in each _METHOD_ cell with a numerical aperture objective lens . as shown in figure the presence of _PROTEIN_ increased the number of _METHOD_ cells and the proportion of cells that accumulated _METHOD_ in punctate structures as well as in the _LOCATION_ . by contrast _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ resulted in a pronounced reduction in the percentage of cells that exhibited _METHOD_ _METHOD_ in punctate structures despite a marked increase in the total number of _METHOD_ cells . these results confirmed that _PROTEIN_ resulted in a mild but significant increase in intracellular _METHOD_ accumulation and indicated that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ had opposite effects on the accumulation of _METHOD_ in the small punctate structures . to investigate the identity of the small punctate structures that accumulated _METHOD_ in the presence of _PROTEIN_ we first asked whether they represented either a domain of the _LOCATION_ or a sorting compartment between the _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ . to do this we examined cells that accumulated _METHOD_ after cotransfecting leaf tissues with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and the _LOCATION_ marker yellow _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ hdel constructs . _METHOD_ hdel contains a c terminal hdel tetrapeptide that promotes receptor mediated retrieval to the _LOCATION_ so if the punctate structures that accumulate _METHOD_ in the presence of _PROTEIN_ are part of the _LOCATION_ or the retrieval pathway they should also accumulate _METHOD_ hdel . we found that _METHOD_ hdel colocalized with _METHOD_ in the _LOCATION_ network but did not mark the small punctate _METHOD_ structures indicating that these structures were distinct from the _LOCATION_ and were unlikely to represent an intermediate on the _LOCATION_ retrieval pathway . to test whether the _METHOD_ labeled punctate structures represented an _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ intermediate that was incompatible with _METHOD_ _METHOD_ the _LOCATION_ markers _METHOD_ hdel and _METHOD_ hdel were coexpressed with _PROTEIN_ and in all cells examined _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ fully colocalized . this confirmed that _METHOD_ hdel does not label a compartment that is incompatible with _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and further suggested that the punctate structures that are labeled by _METHOD_ were not derived from the _LOCATION_ retrieval pathway . coexpression of _METHOD_ hdel with _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ highlighted the existence of a second type of punctate structure that was faintly labeled by _METHOD_ in the presence of _PROTEIN_ . as with the small punctate structures initially observed these structures excluded _METHOD_ hdel indicating they were also post _LOCATION_ compartments and were mobile . however they were apparently larger and exhibited dimmer _METHOD_ than the other punctate structures . in contrast with the complex distribution of _METHOD_ in the presence of _PROTEIN_ when _METHOD_ was coexpressed with _PROTEIN_ it accumulated exclusively in the reticular network where it colocalized precisely with _METHOD_ hdel consistent with the previous conclusion that _PROTEIN_ inhibits _LOCATION_ traffic between the _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ apparatus . these observations suggested that _PROTEIN_ behaves differently from _PROTEIN_ on biosynthetic _LOCATION_ traffic acting downstream of the _LOCATION_ and probably not upstream of the _LOCATION_ retrieval compartment . one possible explanation for the accumulation of _METHOD_ in the _LOCATION_ and post _LOCATION_ compartments in the presence of _PROTEIN_ is that _PROTEIN_ might act directly in both _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ traffic and in a subsequent trafficking step . alternatively _PROTEIN_ might act specifically at a _PROTEIN_ stage of biosynthetic traffic causing _METHOD_ to accumulate initially in post _LOCATION_ compartments with accumulation upstream arising as a secondary effect . to test if _PROTEIN_ directly inhibits _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ trafficking we next examined whether it inhibited _LOCATION_ targeting of sialyltransferase _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ a _METHOD_ based _LOCATION_ marker . consistent with previous observations when _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was coexpressed with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ redistributed from a punctate pattern typical of the _LOCATION_ apparatus to the _LOCATION_ though residual labeling of _LOCATION_ stacks was still evident . by contrast coexpression of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ with _PROTEIN_ had little if any effect on the localization of the _LOCATION_ marker . moreover the _METHOD_ labeled _LOCATION_ stacks were similar in apparent size and number to those of control cells . these observations provided further evidence that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ have distinct effects on biosynthetic _LOCATION_ traffic and suggested that unlike _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ might not act directly in _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ transport . to identify the post _LOCATION_ punctate structures that accumulated _METHOD_ in the presence of _PROTEIN_ a variety of endomembrane markers were coexpressed with _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ . because the larger fainter punctate structures that accumulated _METHOD_ in the presence of _PROTEIN_ were reminiscent of _LOCATION_ stacks with respect to their number motility and morphology in the confocal microscope _METHOD_ was coexpressed with _PROTEIN_ and the _LOCATION_ marker _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . because the larger _METHOD_ labeled punctate structures were often slightly brighter than the associated _LOCATION_ network they could be identified by careful examination even in the absence of _METHOD_ hdel . strikingly _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ colocalized with these large faint punctate structures but not with the smaller brighter ones . when control cells coexpressing _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ without _METHOD_ were imaged with identical imaging parameters there was no visible signal in the _METHOD_ image excluding the possibility that the _LOCATION_ sized faint punctate structures represented bleed through of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ into the _METHOD_ detection channel . the small punctate structures that accumulated _METHOD_ in the presence of _PROTEIN_ were amongst those structures labeled by a dye that can label a variety of _LOCATION_ prevacuolar and endosomal or putatively endosomal compartments in a variety of plant cells . to further clarify the identity of the small punctate structures we performed a double labeling experiment with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is involved in the sorting of proteins with sequence specific _LOCATION_ sorting signals and tagged _PROTEIN_ is known to localize predominantly to a prevacuolar compartment that can be labeled by by markers derived from plant _LOCATION_ sorting receptors and by soluble _LOCATION_ targeted markers . when _METHOD_ was coexpressed with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ the small bright punctate structures labeled by _METHOD_ were also marked by _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ indicating that these structures represent a pvc . because _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ caused _METHOD_ to accumulate in both _LOCATION_ and pvcs it raised the question whether _PROTEIN_ inhibited only the biosynthetic pathway to the pm or also _LOCATION_ traffic . to clarify this we tested the effect of _PROTEIN_ on the _LOCATION_ transport of spo _METHOD_ a _METHOD_ variant that travels from the _LOCATION_ to the central lytic _LOCATION_ via the _LOCATION_ apparatus and a pvc . when spo _METHOD_ was _PROTEIN_ alone in tobacco epidermal cells _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was dim but could be seen in punctate structures that represent a pvc . _METHOD_ was not observed in the central _LOCATION_ suggesting that spo _METHOD_ may not be sufficiently stable or _METHOD_ in this compartment under our growth conditions . as expected cells that were cotransfected with spo _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ exhibited markedly increased _METHOD_ _METHOD_ in a reticulate network typical of the _LOCATION_ consistent with the view that spo _METHOD_ is normally transported rapidly from the _LOCATION_ via the _LOCATION_ apparatus to the _LOCATION_ where it fails to accumulate . by contrast coexpression with _PROTEIN_ did not alter spo _METHOD_ _METHOD_ intensity or distribution and the _METHOD_ labeled pvc compartments were similar in apparent size and number to those of control cells . moreover we did not observe _LOCATION_ accumulation of spo _METHOD_ in the presence of _PROTEIN_ as reported when dominant negative rab or rab mutants were coexpressed with _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ markers in arabidopsis protoplasts or tobacco leaves . thus _PROTEIN_ appears not to affect spo _METHOD_ transport to the _LOCATION_ along the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ pvc pathway . these observations are also consistent with the previous conclusion that _PROTEIN_ does not act directly in _LOCATION_ to _LOCATION_ transport and suggest rather that _PROTEIN_ acts specifically in the _PROTEIN_ secretory pathway to the apoplast . the presence of _METHOD_ in a _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ positive pvc in some control cells suggested that at least a portion of the _METHOD_ protein enters the _LOCATION_ pathway . the increased labeling of the pvc in the presence of _PROTEIN_ could be explained if the rab mutant inhibits _METHOD_ trafficking between the _LOCATION_ and apoplast resulting in more _METHOD_ entering the _LOCATION_ pathway . alternatively _PROTEIN_ may act at the pvc to inhibit _METHOD_ traffic from pvc to _LOCATION_ or pm . to investigate these possibilities we first asked whether _METHOD_ indeed traffics to the _LOCATION_ in the absence and presence of _PROTEIN_ . if a proportion of _METHOD_ is transported to the _LOCATION_ from the pvc its presence there may be difficult to determine owing to the large volume low ph and proteolytic activity of this compartment . it has been reported that _METHOD_ can be stabilized in the _LOCATION_ of arabidopsis and tobacco cells by treatment with the _LOCATION_ permeant protease inhibitor d particularly in the dark . therefore we investigated the accumulation of _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ hdel in d treated tissues . in these experiments infiltration was performed with agrobacterium harboring pvkh _METHOD_ at to ensure high rates of _METHOD_ synthesis and transport . thirty six hours after infiltration with agrobacterium shortly after the onset of _METHOD_ accumulation transfected areas of the leaf were infiltrated with d then excised from the plant and floated on a solution of d in darkness for h. confocal imaging revealed that _METHOD_ was clearly detectable in the _LOCATION_ of infected epidermal cells whereas _METHOD_ hdel was largely excluded . we used the same method to investigate the effect of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ on the transport and accumulation of _METHOD_ in tissues treated with d. all confocal images were acquired with the same imaging parameters which were chosen to allow detection of the _LOCATION_ signals in the control samples without excessive saturation of signal from the _PROTEIN_ sample . coexpression of _PROTEIN_ did not inhibit _METHOD_ accumulation in the _LOCATION_ but rather enhanced it relative to controls _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or _METHOD_ alone whereas _PROTEIN_ prevented _METHOD_ from reaching the _LOCATION_ . consistent with these findings quantitative estimates of _METHOD_ accumulation in the _LOCATION_ indicated a twofold increase in the presence of _PROTEIN_ relative to controls _PROTEIN_ wild type _PROTEIN_ or _METHOD_ alone . to further investigate transport to the _LOCATION_ in the presence of _PROTEIN_ we used d to investigate _LOCATION_ accumulation of aleu _METHOD_ . this is a _METHOD_ derivative that carries a _LOCATION_ sorting signal from petunia hybrida aleurain and that has recently been shown to reach the _LOCATION_ via a _PROTEIN_ dependent pathway in tobacco epidermal cells . using conditions described by citation aleu _METHOD_ was _PROTEIN_ in tobacco epidermal cells either alone or with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or a dominant negative _PROTEIN_ mutant _PROTEIN_ . thirty three to h after infiltration infected areas of leaf tissue were treated with d in darkness and to h _PROTEIN_ confocal images were collected . imaging parameters were chosen to allow detection of the _LOCATION_ signals in the control samples without excessive saturation of signal from the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ samples . in control cells aleu _METHOD_ was visible in the _LOCATION_ and punctate pvcs as well as in the apoplast of some cells owing most probably to saturation of the _LOCATION_ sorting receptors under these conditions _METHOD_ . in the presence of _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ and prevacuolar _METHOD_ of aleu _METHOD_ was still clear and peripheral staining in the apoplast was significantly reduced . by contrast accumulation of aleu _METHOD_ in the _LOCATION_ was inhibited by _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ caused a dramatic increase in aleu _METHOD_ _METHOD_ in the apoplast and in punctate structures as described previously whereas _PROTEIN_ caused aleu _METHOD_ to accumulate in the _LOCATION_ in accordance with our observations with the _LOCATION_ marker spo _METHOD_ . examining samples at higher magnification confirmed that _PROTEIN_ did not cause aleu _METHOD_ to accumulate in the _LOCATION_ consistent with our previous observations with spo _METHOD_ . the marked differences in the distribution of aleu _METHOD_ caused by dominant negative mutants of the rab e rab and rab subclasses provide further evidence of the distinct and specific action of each class of mutant in tobacco epidermal cells . these observations confirmed that a proportion of the _METHOD_ molecules can be transported to the _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ does not inhibit transport of _METHOD_ or aleu _METHOD_ to the _LOCATION_ and _PROTEIN_ appears to increase the proportion of _METHOD_ that accumulates in the _LOCATION_ relative to the cell wall . thus the accumulation of _METHOD_ in pvc in the presence of _PROTEIN_ could reflect an increase in the proportion of _METHOD_ that enters the _LOCATION_ to _LOCATION_ pathway . however we also considered the possibility that the pvc may lie on the pathway between _LOCATION_ and apoplast and that _PROTEIN_ may act at or beyond this compartment to inhibit the transport of _METHOD_ to the apoplast . to test these possibilities we investigated the _LOCATION_ targeting specificity of _PROTEIN_ and asked whether the pvc lies on the default pathway to the apoplast . because rab proteins must be targeted to specific compartments to perform their function we asked whether _PROTEIN_ carried information for targeting heterologous proteins to either the _LOCATION_ or pvc . _METHOD_ was fused to the n terminus of wild type _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ which lacks the conserved cys residues that are required for c terminal prenylation and _LOCATION_ attachment . the resulting fusions were coexpressed in tobacco epidermal cells with the _LOCATION_ marker _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . as shown in figure _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was exclusively localized to the cytoplasm and punctate structures positive for _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ indicating that _PROTEIN_ has specific targeting information for _LOCATION_ stacks . labeling of the _LOCATION_ was most evident in cells that exhibited the lowest _PROTEIN_ levels becoming increasingly difficult to distinguish from the _LOCATION_ pool as _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ levels increased . this suggests that _LOCATION_ labeling was a saturable process . moreover the two mutant alleles _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ were exclusively _LOCATION_ strongly suggesting that _PROTEIN_ requires both normal nucleotide binding and c terminal prenylation to target _METHOD_ to the _LOCATION_ apparatus . in contrast with the precise colocalization of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ to the _LOCATION_ apparatus _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ labeled _LOCATION_ associated punctate structures that were also observed in complete isolation from _LOCATION_ stacks . again targeting was dependent on normal _PROTEIN_ binding as the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ mutant was _LOCATION_ . to examine if there was any fraction of _PROTEIN_ associated with the _METHOD_ labeled pvc compartment we coexpressed _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . in cells where intracellular _METHOD_ could be identified in small bright and large faint punctate structures _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ colocalized to the latter but not to the former indicating that _PROTEIN_ did not associate with the pvc and confirming its location on _LOCATION_ stacks . images of cells _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in the absence of intracellular _METHOD_ excluded the possibility that the weak _METHOD_ signal in the large punctate structures in figure was bleed through from _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ to the _METHOD_ channel . these observations indicate that _PROTEIN_ has the capacity to target _METHOD_ specifically to the _LOCATION_ apparatus and suggest that this organelle is its likely site of action . finally we investigated why _METHOD_ was detected in the _PROTEIN_ positive pvc . although _METHOD_ has previously been observed in and isolated from the apoplast it is nevertheless possible that it carries a cryptic _LOCATION_ sorting determinant that promotes the entry of some proportion of the _METHOD_ into the _LOCATION_ pathway . alternatively it may be that the default pathway to the apoplast includes the _PROTEIN_ positive pvc from which _LOCATION_ and secreted proteins are sorted . if the pvc does lie on the default pathway it should be labeled by other secreted proteins . to test this hypothesis we constructed a secreted form of monomeric red _METHOD_ _METHOD_ a monomeric derivative of dsred that is unrelated to _METHOD_ and foreign to plants . this marker _METHOD_ was coexpressed with _METHOD_ in tobacco epidermal cells which were imaged h after infiltration when the rate of marker _PROTEIN_ and transport was at its highest . in cells with the highest steady state levels of _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ transport both proteins were visible in the _LOCATION_ but the pvc was labeled by _METHOD_ only . nevertheless _METHOD_ was clearly observed in the apoplast where it was stable and accumulated in a _METHOD_ form . this demonstrates that not all secreted proteins accumulate in the pvc en route to the apoplast and argues in favor of a cryptic _LOCATION_ sorting signal within _METHOD_ that diverts a portion of the protein to the _PROTEIN_ positive pvc .

and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ which created a hpai site by silent substitution . the coding sequences of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were obtained by digestion with xhoi and bamhi _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and cloned between the sali and bamhi sites of _PROTEIN_ a derivative of gus . _PROTEIN_ was generated as follows the _PROTEIN_ coding sequence was cloned as an xhoi bamhi fragment in the corresponding sites of pu bop an nhei bamhi fragment was isolated and inserted into gus at the xbai and bamhi sites upstream of uida the uida coding sequence was removed by digestion with and bamhi treatment with klenow fragment of dna polymerase i and religation to regenerate the bamhi site and produce _PROTEIN_ . to generate the plasmid spo _METHOD_ the xbai saci fragment of spo _METHOD_ in the plasmid spo _METHOD_

in tobacco leaf lower epidermal cells was performed according to citation except that plants were cultivated in constant light unless otherwise stated . unless otherwise stated the bacterial used for infiltration of the lower epidermis was for untagged _PROTEIN_ wild type and mutant for _PROTEIN_ and for _METHOD_ constructs . thirty three to h after infiltration with agrobacterium tumefaciens shortly after the onset of _METHOD_ accumulation infected areas of the leaf were infiltrated with d . the d infiltrated leaves were excised from the plant and floated on a solution of d at in darkness . cells were imaged h _PROTEIN_ when steady state _METHOD_ accumulation and transport was at its maximum . staining of cells coexpressing _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ was performed by submerging pieces of transfected leaves in for to min . quantitative estimates of the degree of _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ in medial optical sections through epidermal cells were made using the histogram function of the zeiss lsm software version to determine the average pixel intensity in regions of interest defined within the _LOCATION_ . the average pixel intensity in uninfected cells was used to determine the background signal which was subtracted from each datum . depending on the transfection efficiency and the magnification at which images were acquired in each of the four quantified experiments the brightest to cells in each image were quantified . unusually small cells with low _LOCATION_ volumes were excluded from the analysis because these tended to show very high _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ relative to other cells in all samples . in each experiment the average _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ in each sample was normalized to the value calculated for _METHOD_ d. unless otherwise stated to h after infiltration of leaves with agrobacterium strains lower epidermis was analyzed with an upright zeiss lsm laser scanning microscope using a objective for low magnification imaging and either a c apochromat water immersion or a plan apochromat oil immersion lens for higher magnification images . pieces of leaf were sampled randomly from the infected area and mounted in water for simple observation or in a
