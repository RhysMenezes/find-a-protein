arabidopsis thaliana has a number of response regulators implicated in the histidine phosphorelay signal transduction . according to the current consistent model both the type a and type b arr family members play crucial roles in the cytokinin signaling circuitry . however this higher plant has a few extra arrs on which no attention has been paid so far . characterization of these extra arrs might provide us with new insight into the phosphorelay signal transduction in plants . for this reason in this study we extensively examined the natures of such a representative _PROTEIN_ . transcripts of _PROTEIN_ were _PROTEIN_ predominantly in reproductive organs and a _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion protein was localized in the cytoplasmic space in onion epidermal cells . the purified _PROTEIN_ protein had the ability to undergo phosphorylation in vitro when incubated with phospho _PROTEIN_ indicating that _PROTEIN_ has the fundamental ability to participate into a his asp phosphorelay pathway in its own right . in plants transgenic lines overexpressing _PROTEIN_ were characterized _PROTEIN_ which showed the characteristic dwarf phenotypes with poorly developed root _METHOD_ . the results of northern blot hybridization with selected sets of hormone responsive genes suggested that cytokinin responses are selectively attenuated in _PROTEIN_ ox while other hormone responses occur normally . the results of microarray analyses with cytokinin treated wild type and _PROTEIN_ ox plants further supported the view that cytokinin responses are globally attenuated in _PROTEIN_ ox at least at the level of gene regulation . finally we demonstrated that the dwarf phenotypes of _PROTEIN_ ox are very similar to those of the wooden leg mutant which has a severe lesion in the _PROTEIN_ cytokinin receptor of histidine protein kinase . these results suggested that _PROTEIN_ might also be implicated directly or indirectly in the cytokinin responsive phophorelay signal transduction .
the common feature of arrs is the so called receiver domains of about amino acids in which a phospho accepting invariant aspartate residue is located . type a and type b arrs have such typical receiver domains at their n terminal ends . however the type b arr family members have long c terminal extensions in which the dna binding domains are commonly found . such a receiver domain is also found in some histidine protein kinases _PROTEIN_ . in any case a receiver domain is assumed to serve as an essential phospho acceptor in a phosphorelay . when the amino acid sequences of these receiver domains were aligned it appears that three amino acids are invariantly conserved . however the overall amino acid sequences are highly divergent from one family to another . this is further evident when a phylogenetic tree was constructed with the amino acid sequences of these receiver domains . more interestingly the results of these analyses indicated that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are obviously excluded from both the type a and type b family members albeit that the apparent structural designs of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are very similar to those of type a arrs . therefore it is tempting to speculate that these outsider arrs might play certain roles different from those of type a and type b arrs in plants . it may also be noteworthy that some predicted proteins highly homologous to _PROTEIN_ and/or _PROTEIN_ are found in the databases for other plant species . considering these in this study we focused on these outsider arrs . as the first step we cloned each cdna for the predicted _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ genes in order to make sure that they are indeed functional genes . we succeeded in doing so and the amino acid sequences of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and the exon intron alignments of their genes were confirmed as predicted . a hallmarked feature of type a arrs is that the corresponding genes are very rapidly activated in plants at the level of transcription in response to cytokinin . it is first critical to examine whether or not _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are also induced in response to cytokinin . the results showed that this is not the case . the transcript of _PROTEIN_ was accumulated rapidly when young seedlings were treated with cytokinin but the _PROTEIN_ levels of _PROTEIN_ never fluctuated in response to other plant hormones as expected . under these conditions the _PROTEIN_ levels of _PROTEIN_ were not affected at all in response to any hormones including cytokinin . even when we examined such hormone responsiveness at different time points the _PROTEIN_ levels of _PROTEIN_ did not fluctuate in response to cytokinin . the _PROTEIN_ levels of _PROTEIN_ were too low to quantitatively detect in young seedlings . as judged by the cytokinin responsiveness _PROTEIN_ is clearly distinctive from authentic type a arrs . for these reasons together we focused on _PROTEIN_ in the hope of gaining new insight into the arabidopsis phosphorelay signal transduction in which _PROTEIN_ might play an important role . the accumulation profiles of _PROTEIN_ were examined with rna prepared from various organs at different developmental stages of plants . transcripts of _PROTEIN_ were predominantly detected in certain reproductive organs including flowers and siliques . we also examined the intracellular localization profile of _PROTEIN_ by employing a _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ recombinant gene . the result of a bombardment _PROTEIN_ assay with onion epidermal cells showed that _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ displayed a localization profile very similar to _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ suggesting _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was localized _PROTEIN_ in the cytoplasmic space . under the same experimental conditions _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was localized at a confined region that most likely represents the _LOCATION_ as previously demonstrated . we then asked the critical question of whether or not _PROTEIN_ does indeed have the ability to undergo phosphorylation at the essential aspartate residue . this was also demonstrated to be the case . to carry out an in vitro phosphorylation experiment the purified _PROTEIN_ polypeptide was prepared . a mutant _PROTEIN_ polypeptide was also prepared in which the phospho accepting aspartate residue has been changed to an aspargine residue _PROTEIN_ . these purified polypeptides were incubated in vitro with the purified _PROTEIN_ polypeptide that has previously been radioactively phosphorylated at its histidine site . when phospho _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were mixed together the radioactive phosphoryl group on _PROTEIN_ disappeared within min while nothing happened when _PROTEIN_ was used . these events were best interpreted by assuming that a phosphoryl group on _PROTEIN_ was transiently transferred onto _PROTEIN_ and then it was released rapidly from _PROTEIN_ . in other words _PROTEIN_ has a strong phospho histidine phosphatase activity in which the phospho accepting aspartate residue is critically involved . it may be worth mentioning that many other response regulators also display such an apparent phosphatase activity as previously demonstrated for the type a _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . these results showed that _PROTEIN_ has the fundamental ability to participate into a his asp phosphorelay pathway in its own right . we then took genetic approaches to gain insight into the function of _PROTEIN_ . first of all we attempted to search for an appropriate mutant line that carries a t dna insertion in the _PROTEIN_ gene . unfortunately no appropriate _PROTEIN_ mutant is available in the public arabidopsis mutant banks including the kazusa dna research institute the salk institute genomic analysis laboratory and elsewhere . therefore we decided to establish transgenic lines overexpressing _PROTEIN_ based on the assumption that _PROTEIN_ might play a role at a rate limiting regulatory step of a phosphorelay pathway . to do so a recombinant _PROTEIN_ gene connected to the cauliflower mosaic virus promoter was employed . on the first screening of _PROTEIN_ overexpressing transgenic lines _PROTEIN_ many hygromycin resistant young seedlings appeared on the selection _METHOD_ agar plates . however we noticed that their morphologies were considerably different from those of wild type seedlings . these putative _PROTEIN_ ox young seedlings all displayed considerably smaller cotyledons with normal morphologies . more strikingly the development of their primary roots was markedly delayed as compared with those of wild type seedlings . we carefully followed their developmental stages further and it was revealed that these putative _PROTEIN_ ox plants eventually showed dwarf phenotypes . at this stage we confirmed that these putative transgenic plants accumulated a large amount of transcripts that hybridized with a probe specific to _PROTEIN_ . during the prolonged incubation of these dwarf plants they developed primary inflorescences but they set neither normal flowers nor siliques resulting in sterility . to confirm these intriguing phenotypes of _PROTEIN_ ox transgenic plants we repeated the transformation experiment once again . at this time we employed appropriate mutant _PROTEIN_ genes as references . they were _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ each of which was designed so as to encode a mutant protein lacking the essential aspartate residue the aspartate residue at the position of was replaced with asparagine _PROTEIN_ or glutamate _PROTEIN_ . these gene products are most likely inactive as far as the phospho accepting ability was concerned as demonstrated . in this second experiment most of the _PROTEIN_ ox transgenic lines showed the dwarf phenotypes while both the resulting _PROTEIN_ ox and _PROTEIN_ ox plants were indistinguishable from wild type plants . we repeated the same experiments independently three more times in order to statistically confirm the dwarf phenotypes of _PROTEIN_ ox as summarized in table . we then concluded that an aberrant and ectopic _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in transgenic plants results in a severe defect of plant development . in particular the development of roots is severely impaired in _PROTEIN_ ox . considering the _PROTEIN_ that _PROTEIN_ ox and _PROTEIN_ ox showed no phenotype it was suggested that an accumulation of _PROTEIN_ with the phospho accepting activity is critically relevant to the characteristic dwarf phenotypes . in this respect certain transgenic plants overexpressing type a arrs have been characterized showing that they play a negative role in the cytokinin signal transduction circuitry . their morphological phenotypes were subtle in that no apparent morphological change was seen although they were less sensitive to cytokinin in callus formation assays . in the case of _PROTEIN_ ox interestingly its phospho accepting asp residue appears to be not necessary for the negative action of _PROTEIN_ . this may suggest the modes of action are different between type a arrs and _PROTEIN_ . in any case to address these issues further we _PROTEIN_ employed _PROTEIN_ ox young seedlings because of the sterility . _PROTEIN_ ox plants showed a global defect of plant development resulting in the dwarf phenotypes . in general these phenotypes are indicative of plant hormone associated events . thus we examined _PROTEIN_ ox with reference to hormone responsiveness at the level of gene regulation . the examined hormones were auxin abscisic acid ethylene and cytokinin . we examined the _PROTEIN_ of certain selected genes each of which has been documented to rapidly respond to each hormone in question at the level of transcription . the hallmarked genes tested were followings _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . both the wild type and _PROTEIN_ ox young seedlings were treated with each hormone and then rna was prepared at appropriate intervals followed by analyses with semi quantitative reverse transcriptase based polymerase chain reaction with each set of specific primers . as far as the responses of these genes to the respective hormones were concerned it was demonstrated that _PROTEIN_ ox could respond to auxin aba and ethylene as normally and remarkably as in the case of wild type plants . however _PROTEIN_ ox failed to respond to cytokinin . here it may also be worth mentioning that we treated _PROTEIN_ ox young seedlings by spraying with cytokinin but the resultant phenotypes were essentially the same as those of _PROTEIN_ ox seedlings without cytokinin treatment . taken together it was suggested that cytokinin responses might severely be attenuated in _PROTEIN_ ox whereas other hormone responses occur normally . although gibberelin and brassinosteroid were not concerned in these experiments this finding now led us to further examine _PROTEIN_ ox with special reference to cytokinin responses . although we showed that _PROTEIN_ ox could not respond to cytokinin when the hallmarked cytokinin inducible _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ genes were examined this result does not necessarily justify the assumption that cytokinin responses are widely attenuated in _PROTEIN_ ox . to gain a more comprehensive view in this particular aspect we adopted a microarray analysis of _PROTEIN_ ox in _METHOD_ of cytokinin responses . in other words cytokinin responsive genes were comprehensively compared between wild type and _PROTEIN_ ox plants with a genome wide viewpoint . we adopted the well established microarray system of affymetrix genechip _PROTEIN_ containing more than probe sets representing approximately genes . first of all we collected such microarray data for wild type plants . the wild type plants treated with and without cytokinin were intensively subjected to microarray analyses and the statistically meaningful data were collected . with _PROTEIN_ to such complicated data in general we must somehow evaluate the reliability . to do so we first analyzed certain selected data for those genes involved in the his asp phosphorelay which included histidine protein kinase genes ahp related genes type b arr genes type a arr genes and both the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ genes . fig . shows the fold change of these transcripts . the results indicated that most of the cytokinin inducible type a arr genes were indeed upregulated in the cytokinin treated plants while other genes were not significantly fluctuated except for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . the upregulation of _PROTEIN_ was as expected . the fluctuations of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ might also be intriguing . in any event the microarray data selectively highlighted the cytokinin inducible type a arr genes indicating that our collected data are highly reliable in a statistic sense . in addition to these phosphorelay associated genes of course many other genes were either upregulated or downregulated in response to cytokinin . however the detailed analyses of these will be described elsewhere _PROTEIN_ . meanwhile we collected such microarray data for _PROTEIN_ ox plants under essentially the same conditions as those adopted for wild type plants . the experimental data of _PROTEIN_ ox were listed in table in comparison with those of wild type plants . in this list the upregulated genes were lined up in the order of their fcs in the way that the most highly upregulated gene in wild type plants was listed at the top . it was revealed that most of the cytokinin upregulated genes in wild type plants did not significantly fluctuate in _PROTEIN_ ox in response to cytokinin . among all the upregulated genes in wild type plants only were upregulated in _PROTEIN_ ox . more strictly among of the putative cytokinin inducible genes only a few genes were upregulated in _PROTEIN_ ox . these results of genome wide analyses strongly supported the view that cytokinin responses are globally attenuated in _PROTEIN_ ox at least at the level of gene regulation . in the listed cytokinin upregulated genes in wild type plants there were many intriguing genes in _METHOD_ of cytokinin actions in general . they include putative transcription _PROTEIN_ and putative signal transduction associated _PROTEIN_ and etc . as mentioned above however the close inspection of these genes will be conducted in detail in elsewhere . it should be at least noted here that a microarray analysis of cytokinin regulated genes has recently been carried out using the element affymetrix arabidopsis genechips by other researchers . other microarray data which are closely relevant to cytokinin action also became available recently . detailed comparisons between out data and others remain to be conducted . the above findings finally led us to remember the well documented arabiodpsis mutant named wooden leg which carries a mutant allele of the _PROTEIN_ cytokinin receptor gene . it was reasonably assumed that in the wol mutant cytokinin responses are attenuated at least in part because wol appears to represent a loss of function mutant of the _PROTEIN_ cytokinin receptor . so we obtained the original wol seeds and compared the growth profiles of wol with those of _PROTEIN_ ox under same growth conditions . both the wol and _PROTEIN_ ox plants showed very similar developmental morphologies on _METHOD_ agar plates displaying the dwarf phenotypes with poorly developed root _METHOD_ . the most striking phenotype of wol is that the wol roots show an extremely reduced cell number and exclusive xylem differentiation within the vascular tissue . interestingly the _PROTEIN_ ox roots also displayed essentially the same characteristics as those of wol . when cross sections of primary roots were compared the vascular tissue of _PROTEIN_ ox contained an extremely reduced number of cells as in the case of wol . concomitantly the numbers of pericycle cells were also reduced in both the wol and _PROTEIN_ ox roots whereas the organization of other root cells appeared to be normal . more strikingly the residing cells in the altered vascular tissue of both the wol and _PROTEIN_ ox roots showed an exclusively xylem like nature when they were stained with basic fuchsin followed by examination with a confocal scanning laser microscope . taken together the phenotypes of _PROTEIN_ ox were found to be quite similar to those of wol which has a severe defect in the _PROTEIN_ cytokinin receptor . we further compared the phenotypes of _PROTEIN_ ox and wol with each other with special reference to cytokinin actions . employing their explants green callus formation assays were carried out on _METHOD_ agar plates each of which contained varied concentrations of cytokinin and auxin according to the established procedures . after incubation for d when green callus and shoot formation on the plates were observed it was shown that both the _PROTEIN_ ox and wol explants were far less sensitive to cytokinin as compared with wild type and _PROTEIN_ ox explants . these results are also compatible with the view that as in wol cytokinin responses are attenuated in _PROTEIN_ ox at least in part . based on the results of this study we conclude that a. thaliana has a unique response regulator named _PROTEIN_ the amino acid sequence of which is considerably divergent from those of type a arrs while their structural designs are similar to each other . unlike type a arrs the _PROTEIN_ gene is not activated at the level of transcription in response to cytokinin suggesting that _PROTEIN_ plays a role distinctive from those of type a arrs . surprisingly the results of intensive examinations consistently supported the idea that _PROTEIN_ plays a role in close to the cytokinin responsive signaling circuitry . it was demonstrated that cytokinin responses are globally attenuated in _PROTEIN_ ox at least at the level of gene regulation . more specifically _PROTEIN_ ox transgenic plants look like wol which has a sever lesion in the _PROTEIN_ cytokinin receptor . however these results came from _PROTEIN_ the analyses of transgenic plants overexpressing _PROTEIN_ . furthermore the transcript of _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ predominantly in reproductive organs while the effect of ectopic _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ was seen in vegetative tissues . therefore it is not certain whether _PROTEIN_ is directly integrated into the cytokinin signaling circuitry . the well documented histidine protein kinase _PROTEIN_ is reminiscent in this sense that transgenic explants overexpressing _PROTEIN_ show the phenotypes that mimic cytokinin action . nevertheless it has not yet been proven that _PROTEIN_ is the primary component of the cytokinin signal transduction . thus clarification of this issue must await further examination which should include characterization of loss of function mutants . however it is at least assumed that _PROTEIN_ is integrated in its own right into a certain phosphorelay pathway which might be closely linked to the ahk mediated cytokinin signaling circuitry . one of the intriguing findings of this study is that the phenotypes of _PROTEIN_ ox are very similar to those of wol as mentioned above . in both _PROTEIN_ ox and wol the characteristic anomalies were observed in the vascular tissue in roots . in addition it was reported that the wol mutant _METHOD_ side roots from the upper hypocotyls . in this respect _PROTEIN_ ox transgenic plants also occasionally formed a premature side root like structure from the upper hypocotyls . however the phenotypes of _PROTEIN_ ox are not exactly the same as those of wol in detail _PROTEIN_ . in this sense it is not certain whether or not _PROTEIN_ ox is a phenocopy of wol . in any case this interesting issue remains to be addressed further by taking the recent report for the wol mutant into consideration in which it was suggested that the wol phenotypes might be due to a separate function of the _PROTEIN_ his kinase cytokinin receptor . the mechanism by which the ectopic _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ results in an apparent interference with the cytokinin signaling circuitry is also not known . _PROTEIN_ may interact through direct protein protein interaction with one of the crucial his asp phosphorelay components that are directly involved in the cytokinin signaling circuitry or _PROTEIN_ may act indirectly by increasing the function of an as yet identified negative regulator that is implicated in the cytokinin signaling circuitry . however a more likely model is that _PROTEIN_ inhibits an activation process of type b arr transcription _PROTEIN_ by competing for phosphotransfer from upstream phosphotransfer _PROTEIN_ . two lines of evidence in this study supported this view . _PROTEIN_ has the in vitro ability to undergo phosphorylation through interacting with an ahp phosphotransmitter displaying a strong phospho histidine protein phosphatase activity . transgenic plants overexpressing a mutant _PROTEIN_ protein lacking the phospho accepting site displayed no apparent phenotype . in any case it is tempting to speculate that _PROTEIN_ exerts a negative regulatory function in a given his asp phosphorelay pathway which might have a close link to the cytokinin signaling circuitry . in plants transcripts of _PROTEIN_ are accumulated predominately if not exclusively in reproductive organs . unfortunately _PROTEIN_ ox transgenic plants did not normally develop such organs including flowers and siliques . so we could not inspect any defects of _PROTEIN_ ox in these organs . to clarify the exact biological event in plants into which _PROTEIN_ is directly implicated we must therefore characterize loss of function mutants of _PROTEIN_ as mentioned above . to this end a close relative of _PROTEIN_ named _PROTEIN_ must also be taken into consideration because it is possible that both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ act redundantly in concert with each other . in any case in addition to relatively well characterized type a and type b arrs this new class of response regulators must be taken into consideration for a better understanding the whole picture of his asp phosphorelay signaling network in a. thaliana .
a. thaliana plants _PROTEIN_ used in this study are columbia ecotype . the wol mutant is a gift form yka helariutta . plants were grown with h h dark _METHOD_ illumination at on agar plates containing _METHOD_ salts and sucrose _METHOD_ unless otherwise noted . for preparation of total rna from various organs plants were grown with h h dark _METHOD_ illumination at on soil for d. if necessary hygromycin b was added to agar plates . e. coli k strain _PROTEIN_ carrying the plasmid born multicopy arcb gene was used to prepare cytoplasmic _LOCATION_ . e. coli cells were grown in luria broth and the urea treated cytoplasmic _LOCATION_ were purified as described previously . the cytoplasmic _LOCATION_ were used to phosphorylate the _PROTEIN_ phosphotransmitter protein in vitro as described previously . e. coli strain was used as a host for preparations of plant polypeptides as also described previously . total rna was isolated by the method described by carpenter and simon with slight modifications as described previously . when rna samples were used for rt pcr amplification and microarray they were treated with dnase i . to amplify cdnas from an arabidopsis total rna preparation an rt pcr kit was used according to the instructions with specific primers . the resultant pcr fragments were cloned and sequenced with an automated dna sequencer _METHOD_ with the recommended sequencing kits according to the instructions . following primers were used for each cdna amplification _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . for northern blot hybridization rna was separated in agarose gels containing m formaldehyde then transferred to hybond n nylon _LOCATION_ . the fixed _LOCATION_ were hybridized with labeled dna fragments in standard saline phosphate and edta _PROTEIN_ denhardt s solution and _PROTEIN_ buffer containing dextran sulfate and ml salmon sperm dna at for h. the _LOCATION_ were washed twice with _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ for min at room temperature twice with _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ for min at and then with _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ for min at . the washed _LOCATION_ were exposed and analyzed with _PROTEIN_ . an rt pcr kit was used according to the instructions . to perform semi quantitative rt pcr the procedures were slightly modified in which the conditions used were primarily for s for s and for s . it should also be noted that the cycles of pcr were varied for each rna sample and several different cycles were adopted for a given rna sample in order to amplify dsdna in a semi quantitative manner . in such semi quantitative rt pcr the following primers were used _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . for _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in e. coli the cdna fragment encoding the entire _PROTEIN_ coding region was inserted at appropriate restriction sites of _PROTEIN_ plasmid that contains an iptg inducible promotor . this plasmid _PROTEIN_ allowed us to produce _PROTEIN_ with a his tag at the n terminus . this plasmid was also subjected to a site directed mutagenesis to yield pqe _PROTEIN_ by means of an pcr aided method with an appropriate primer . the resulting plasmid carries the mutant _PROTEIN_ gene which encodes the altered _PROTEIN_ with the amino acid substitution at the position of . similarly pqe _PROTEIN_ was also constructed in this case with an appropriate primer . the strain of e. coli harboring was used as the host to produce proteins in question . the transformants of pqe _PROTEIN_ and pqe _PROTEIN_ were grown in luria bertini medium with appropriate antibiotics . cleared cell lysates were obtained by use of french pressure cell press . the lysates were subjected to purification with the use of qiaexpress system . the _PROTEIN_ polypeptides were purified as described previously . urea treated _LOCATION_ were incubated with the purified _PROTEIN_ polypeptide at in the presence of mm _PROTEIN_ mm kcl and mm in tedg buffer then an excess amount of cold _PROTEIN_ was added to the reaction mixture . the reaction mixture was incubated on ice with purified arr polypeptides for short periods in tedg buffer containing mm kcl and mm . after incubation the samples were immediately subjected to sodium dodecylsulfate _PROTEIN_ polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis . the gel was exposed and analyzed with _PROTEIN_ . the recombinant genes each encoding appropriate _METHOD_ fusion proteins were constructed as described previously . these genes are under control of the camv promoter . the dna fragments encompassing each recombinant gene were used to bombard into onion epidermal cells . after incubation for h the _PROTEIN_ profile of each product was observed with a _METHOD_ microscope as described previously the entire coding sequence of the _PROTEIN_ cdna was amplified by pcr with the following set of primers which will create xbai and noti site ggtctagaatggcaacaaaatccaccgg and aagcggccgctcaagcatcgaagaggtggct . the isolated dna fragment was inserted into the _PROTEIN_ binary vector at xbai/noti site downstream of the camv promoter . the site directed mutants of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ which had aspartate substituted to asparagine and aspartate to glutamate respectively were also made by pcr with the substitution introduced primers and inserted in to the _PROTEIN_ binary vector . the pcr primers used for site directed mutagenesis were as follows _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . these constructs were transformed into agrobacterium tumefaciens strain and then wild type plants were transformed by vacuum infiltration procedures as described previously . transgenic seeds were germinated on _METHOD_ agar plate supplemented with ml hygromycin b ml cefotaxime sodium salt and grown for d and hygromycin resistant plants were selected . the selected young seedlings overexpressing _PROTEIN_ were _PROTEIN_ characterized in this study _PROTEIN_ . it should be noted that transgenic plants transformed with an empty vector were used as proper references . plants were germinated on _METHOD_ agar plates and grown for d. in the case of transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ they were germinated on _METHOD_ agar plates containing hygromycin b and grown for d. they were then transferred to _METHOD_ agar plates without hygromycin b and grown for further d. the plants were sprayed with the solution containing the following hormones dimethyl sulfoxide _METHOD_ benzylaminopurine t zeatin d indole acetic acid aminocyclopromane _PROTEIN_ acid giberellic acid _PROTEIN_ brassinolide abscisic acid methyl salicylate methyl jasmomate . at appropriate intervals the treated plants were harvested and rna was extracted . hypocotyl segments were excised from day old etiolated young seedings . wild type and wol seedlings were grown on _METHOD_ agar plates whereas _PROTEIN_ ox and _PROTEIN_ ox young seedlings were grown on _METHOD_ agar plates containing hygromycin b. explants were cultured on _METHOD_ agar plates each containing varied concentrations of t zeatin and d. after incubation for d each representative callus was collected and photographed after arranging appropriately . total rna samples were prepared from wild type plants and _PROTEIN_ ox plants treated with cytokinin . total rna samples from plants without treatment were also prepared . detailed conditions of plant growth and hormone treatment are as follows wild type plants were grown on _METHOD_ agar plates for weeks and then sprayed with t zeatin and further incubated for h. _PROTEIN_ ox plants selected on _METHOD_ agar plates containing ml hygromycin b for d and then transferred onto _METHOD_ agar plates without hygromycin . after incubation for further d they were treated with cytokinin as described for wild type plants . total rna samples were processed as recommended by affymetrix _PROTEIN_ . double stranded cdna was synthesized from the isolated rna using the superscript double stranded cdna synthesis kit and oligo primer primers containing a sequence recognized by rna polymerase . a portion of the resulting double stranded cdna was used as a template to generate biotin tagged crna from an in vitro transcription reaction using the bio array high yield rna transcript labeling kit . the reaction product was purified with the use of the rneasy rna purification kit . the biotin tagged crna was fragmented and hybridized with dna _PROTEIN_ of affymetrix _PROTEIN_ array at for h. the standard post hybridization wash and double stain protocols were adopted on an affymetrix genechip fluidics station . arrays were scanned on an affymetrix genearray scanner . the results were quantified using microarray suite software . it should be noted that rna processing hybridization and scanning were carried out independently three times for each rna sample . finally such collected raw data of cytokinin treated samples were compared with those of non treated samples using a comparative analysis argorithm in microarray suite software by which fold change was calculated . the differences were classified into increased _PROTEIN_ not changed marginal increase marginal _PROTEIN_ . to identify cytokinin upregulated genes those genes showing fc greater than were selected . to select more properly only those genes assigned as p were selected and only those genes giving raw values greater than in the cytokinin treated data were selected . we applied the similar criteria to identify cytokinin downregulated genes . further more only those genes were selected which fulfilled the above criteria in three independent hybridization _PROTEIN_ assays . essentially the same analyses were carried out for _PROTEIN_ ox plants with and without cytokinin treatment . young seedlings were fixed and embedded according to the method of dolan et al . . sections were made on a sorvall _PROTEIN_ microtome mt using a glass knife . the resulting samples were stained in a toluidine blue solution and photographed on a nikon eclipse using nikon _PROTEIN_ camera . for confocal scanning experiments the roots were stained with basic fuchsin solution as previously described . images were taken on an olympus confocal microscope with an argon ion laser .
