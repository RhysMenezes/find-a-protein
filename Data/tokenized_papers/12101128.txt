the _PROTEIN_ protein is a _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ located lrr receptor like serine threonine kinase that is transiently _PROTEIN_ during plant embryogenesis . our results show that _PROTEIN_ interacts with the kinase associated protein phosphatase _PROTEIN_ in vitro . the kinase interaction domain of _PROTEIN_ does not interact with a catalytically inactive kinase mutant . using proteins in which thr thr and thr in the a loop of the _PROTEIN_ kinase domain were replaced by alanines we show that phosphorylation status of the receptor is involved in interaction with _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ cdnas were fused to two different variants of green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ the yellow _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ or the cyan _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ . both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ proteins are found at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . our results show that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ becomes sequestered into intracellular vesicles when transiently coexpressed with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ proteins . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ proteins were partially sequestered intracellularly in the absence of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein suggesting an active role for _PROTEIN_ dephosphorylation of threonine residues in a loop in receptor internalization . the interaction between the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion proteins was investigated with _METHOD_ spectral imaging microscopy . our results show that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ proteins are colocalized at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ but only show _METHOD_ energy transfer indicative of physical interaction in intracellular vesicles . these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ is an integral part of endocytosis mechanism .
the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ constructs used are shown in . to determine whether the _PROTEIN_ ki domain biochemically and physically interacted with _PROTEIN_ in vitro both the kinase domain of _PROTEIN_ and the ki domain of _PROTEIN_ were _PROTEIN_ as _PROTEIN_ fusion proteins in e. coli . the affinity purified _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ proteins were then used in phosphorylation assays . increasing phosphosphorylation was seen on increasing its concentration . _PROTEIN_ was phosphorylated in the presence of _PROTEIN_ protein . since both proteins are substrates for phosphorylation the level of phosphorylation was determined as a function of protein concentration . above an approximately equimolar ratio increasing amounts of _PROTEIN_ led to an increase in the phosphorylation of _PROTEIN_ and a _PROTEIN_ phosphorylation . the _PROTEIN_ phosphorylation was less affected when protein concentration was _PROTEIN_ in the incubation mix . _PROTEIN_ protein was unable to phosphorylate alone . this demonstrates that _PROTEIN_ is a substrate and that the two proteins biochemically interact in vitro . _PROTEIN_ a loop that is formed from subdomains vii and viii has three threonine residues that are potential phosphorylation sites . to determine whether the interaction and _PROTEIN_ is phosphorylation dependent we tested the catalytically and mutant proteins in which three threonine residues in the _PROTEIN_ a loop have been mutated for their association with _PROTEIN_ by in vitro binding assays . the _PROTEIN_ proteins were incubated in the presence of unlabeled _PROTEIN_ and transferred after electrophoresis onto a _LOCATION_ and incubated with _PROTEIN_ labeled _PROTEIN_ probe . _PROTEIN_ interacted with _PROTEIN_ probe and no interaction was observed between the _PROTEIN_ and and _PROTEIN_ . to further test whether the interaction between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ dependent on the phosphorylation state of protein was treated with alkaline phosphatase alone or with ap in addition to the ap inhibitor and incubated in the presence of unlabeled _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ showed a reduced interaction with the dephosphorylated _PROTEIN_ compared to the phosphorylated _PROTEIN_ or both the ap and api treated _PROTEIN_ . the phosphoaminoacid analysis performed on the _PROTEIN_ by _PROTEIN_ protein showed that it was phosphorylated on serines . these results show that _PROTEIN_ interacts in a phosphorylation dependent manner . furthermore the threonine residues in the _PROTEIN_ a loop seem to play an essential role in the transphosphorylation of the _PROTEIN_ protein . in a previous work we showed that the effect on the phosphorylation activity was similar when _PROTEIN_ a loop threonines were mutated to either glutamic acid residues or to alanine residues . to investigate the role of individual threonine residues in the _PROTEIN_ a loop _PROTEIN_ transphosphorylation all four threonine residues in the _PROTEIN_ a loop that is thr thr thr and thr were mutagenized individually to alanine residues . the transphosphorylation assays with affinity purified _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutant proteins showed that there was a reduced transphosphorylation of _PROTEIN_ when incubated compared to _PROTEIN_ phosphorylation by _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ was not phosphorylated when incubated with _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ . the transphosphorylation assays with _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ show results comparable to those obtained . these results show that thr in the _PROTEIN_ a loop has a major role in both the autophosphorylation activity of _PROTEIN_ and transphosphorylation activity on the ki domain of _PROTEIN_ . this _METHOD_ previous work using casein and myelin basic protein as artificial transphosphorylation targets for _PROTEIN_ . in addition thr also influences the transphosphorylation of the ki domain of _PROTEIN_ . this is a different observation than that obtained with _PROTEIN_ transphosphorylation on casein and mbp where only thr and thr have any influence on the transphosphorylation . this finding implies a role of other threonine residues in a loop in substrate phosphorylation . to determine the protein phosphatase catalytic activity of _PROTEIN_ the full length _PROTEIN_ cdna missing only the n terminal signal anchor was fused to _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in e. coli . the affinity purified _PROTEIN_ protein _PROTEIN_ was incubated with _PROTEIN_ bound _PROTEIN_ phosphorylated _PROTEIN_ and aliquots were taken out at different time intervals . the phosphorylated was dephosphorylated by _PROTEIN_ with increased incubation time . phosphorylated _PROTEIN_ protein was almost completely dephosphorylated by _PROTEIN_ after h . we were also interested in knowing whether protein would phosphorylate in the presence of _PROTEIN_ protein . this led us to perform experiments in which we incubated affinity alone with _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ or with both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ proteins in the presence of _PROTEIN_ . in the presence of the _PROTEIN_ protein there was a reduced phosphorylation or and _PROTEIN_ . these results demonstrate that _PROTEIN_ protein not only protein but also actively prevents autophosphorylation of the receptor suggesting that the _PROTEIN_ protein can _PROTEIN_ the dephosphorylated state of _PROTEIN_ . because _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ interact in vitro it was of interest to determine whether the two proteins are colocalized and can interact in plant cells . for this we transiently _PROTEIN_ in plant protoplasts two different variants of the _METHOD_ the cyan _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ and the yellow _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ that are fused to the c terminal end of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ protein .the _PROTEIN_ type signal anchor acts as an uncleaved signal peptide resulting in cytoplasmic orientation of the _LOCATION_ anchored protein . to study the localization of the _PROTEIN_ protein in plant protoplasts we performed transient transfections with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ constructs . after transfection and incubation for h total protein was isolated fractionated by denaturing _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and immunoblotted using an antiserum against _METHOD_ . the results show that all _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion proteins of the correct size are _PROTEIN_ in plant protoplasts . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein showed localization in the cytoplasm whereas _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein was _PROTEIN_ in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and in the _LOCATION_ . when the protoplasts were transfected with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ a construct in which the _PROTEIN_ protein lacks the sai signal peptide the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein was observed in the cytoplasm compartments . this shows the importance of the _PROTEIN_ sai peptide in _LOCATION_ anchoring of the _PROTEIN_ protein . in our previous studies with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein in plant protoplasts we showed that most of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein is found in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and in a very small amount in endomembranes . in a protoplast _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ is shown . _METHOD_ is represented by the cyan color and _METHOD_ the previously noted location of the _PROTEIN_ protein . the same protoplast was cotransfected with an _LOCATION_ marker _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ that contains a c terminal hdel _LOCATION_ retention signal fused to _METHOD_ . for comparison the chlorophyll _METHOD_ is shown in red . from the combined image it is clear that _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ have different localizations in the _METHOD_ is seen _PROTEIN_ in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ whereas the _LOCATION_ at this stage is almost depleted of protein . the _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ localization is visible as a complex pattern that covers most of the cytoplasm containing area and extends right up to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . it is notably excluded from the chloroplasts and the _LOCATION_ . to examine the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ proteins together we transiently _PROTEIN_ both _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion proteins . when coexpressed striking differences were noted in the localization pattern of both proteins . substantial amounts of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ proteins are now seen internally . at the periphery of the protoplast _PROTEIN_ is found in the areas that coincide with the presence of _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . substantial _METHOD_ _METHOD_ is also seen in a rather diffuse dotted pattern almost in the center of the cell . the _PROTEIN_ protein is found _PROTEIN_ in the center of the cell and less in the peripheral areas . the superimposed image shows that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ only substantially overlap in the central area and in the _LOCATION_ . the comparison of the localization and _PROTEIN_ proteins with the _LOCATION_ marker suggests that the diffuse punctate pattern observed in the colocalization experiment might represent intracellular vesicles such as endosomes containing internalized _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ proteins . we next investigated whether _PROTEIN_ threonine residues and involved in the interaction with _PROTEIN_ and in the transphosphorylation reaction in vitro were involved in the observed internalization of the _PROTEIN_ protein . a construct containing the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion was localized in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ with a rather higher signal seen in a diffuse area in the cytoplasm compared to the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein . when _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was transiently coexpressed with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ substantial amounts of both proteins were found to be sequestered intracellularly . _METHOD_ protein alone localizes at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ but is also seen internally similar to what was seen for the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein . _METHOD_ protein was also seen to be present in the _LOCATION_ suggesting an additional effect of removing the three threonines on the correct secretion of the receptor via the _LOCATION_ . cotransfection of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ did not change the pattern seen for _METHOD_ mutant alone . however the amount of _METHOD_ protein was increased compared with the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ alone . we conclude that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ colocalize to a certain extent . preventing a biochemical or physical interaction by removing the potential _PROTEIN_ substrate threonines in the a loop resulted in a marked intracellular localization of the receptor . coexpressing the mutant fusion proteins along with _PROTEIN_ protein enhanced the fraction of internalized receptors . this suggests that _PROTEIN_ mediated dephosphorylation of the receptor is an essential step in the internalization of the entire receptor complex . to verify that the punctate localization pattern of the mutants and of _PROTEIN_ when coexpressed with _PROTEIN_ protein represents true endosomal localization we simultaneously labeled the cells with . is a lipophilic dye that is taken up by endocytosis when added to yeast or plant cells . protoplasts transiently _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein were incubated with and viewed by confocal microscopy after min . at this timepoint stained only the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ where it overlaps _METHOD_ localization . when incubated for h was internalized and localized in small punctate structures similar to the early endosomal structures reported by citation . as shown in figure h nearly all structures stained by also contained _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . this suggests that the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein is internalized via an endocytotic pathway . to directly study the physical interaction between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ proteins in living plant cells the _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ fusion proteins were used as a donor acceptor pair in fret studies . all constructs used in this study are described in figure . our experiments were based on _METHOD_ spectral imaging microscopy as a detection system . spectral images were taken from small regions of the protoplasts coexpressing _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ fusion proteins and a _METHOD_ emission spectrum corrected for _METHOD_ was then generated . in the case of fret the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ will be quenched and the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ will be increased . for fret to be detected reliably using fspim certain prerequisites must be satisfied . these are that donor and acceptor fluorophores must be present in a ratio close to the absorption of the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ by chlorophyll should be minimized fusion proteins should be properly targeted and finally the fluorophores must be oriented so as to allow close proximity when the target proteins fused to the _METHOD_ interact . we performed fret experiments with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ fusion proteins fused to either the donor _METHOD_ or the acceptor _METHOD_ molecules . in all experiments where fret was observed similar changes in the _METHOD_ intensity ratios were observed _PROTEIN_ of the donor _METHOD_ being fused to _PROTEIN_ or to the _PROTEIN_ . this indicates that the observed increased donor/acceptor ratio is due the energy transfer between the _METHOD_ and the _METHOD_ molecules fused or _PROTEIN_ proteins and not due to an unbalanced _PROTEIN_ ratio . to avoid interference by chlorophyll absorption fret measurements were performed exclusively over the regions lacking chloroplasts . because the fluorophore orientation _PROTEIN_ can not be corrected for any results showing absence of fret may not completely guarantee that no interaction occurred between those proteins . protoplasts were first cotransfected with _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ constructs . the equal _PROTEIN_ of the _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ fusion proteins in protoplasts was demonstrated by immunoblotting of the solubilized proteins using anti _METHOD_ antisera . the spectral images were recorded from the different regions of the protoplasts _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion proteins . the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ intensity ratio deduced from these spectra is over in every of measurements . the _METHOD_ intensity ratio obtained from _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ cotransfected protoplasts was similar to the _METHOD_ intensity ratio shown by _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ coexpressing protoplasts . when the spectra were recorded from protoplasts each _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ the increased _METHOD_ _METHOD_ intensity ratio of more than was seen in about of the measurements . these results show that when the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are in the cytoplasm they interact physically supporting the in vitro experiments performed on bacterially _PROTEIN_ proteins to determine whether physical interaction occurs between _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ proteins we cotransfected protoplasts with either _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ constructs . the immunoblot of the coexpressed proteins using anti _METHOD_ antisera is shown in figure . the near identical size of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion proteins prevents a clear distinction between two proteins on the blot . however no gross imbalance in _PROTEIN_ ratios is evident . we separated the fret experiments performed on the proteins that were coexpressed at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and the proteins that were present intracellularly . an example of an area that was selected for recording is shown in figure where _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are colocalized in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and in the area where vesicular structures are seen . these vesicular structures are present in the cytoplasm and are distinct from the _LOCATION_ and may represent endosomes as suggested by staining . in figure spectra are shown that were obtained from protoplasts coexpressing _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ intensity ratio deduced from these spectra was close to in all of the measurements suggesting that no interaction occurs and _PROTEIN_ at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . the same _METHOD_ intensity ratios of were obtained when protoplasts were cotransfected with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . in about of the protoplasts the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ intensity ratio was close to when the spectra were recorded at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ from protoplasts coexpressing either _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ proteins or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ proteins . however when the spectra were recorded on _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ proteins _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ proteins present intracellularly there was a clear shift in the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ intensity ratio to above and extending to in of measurements . about of the protoplasts showed an increased _METHOD_ _METHOD_ intensity ratio of about when the spectra were recorded from protoplasts coexpressing either _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ proteins or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ proteins intracellularly . taken together these results led us to conclude that the kinase domain of _PROTEIN_ and kinase interaction domain of _PROTEIN_ protein can physically interact in the cytoplasm but also do so when they are attached to their respective complete proteins as present in the internalized vesicles . notably no interaction appears to take place when both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are present in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ .
