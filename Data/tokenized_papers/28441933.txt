fructose is an abundant sugar in plants as it is a breakdown product of both major sucrose cleaving enzymes . to enter metabolism fructose is phosphorylated by a fructokinase . known frks are members of a diverse family of _PROTEIN_ kinases known as the phosphofructokinase b family . the complete complement of active fructokinases has not been reported for any plant species . protein sequence analysis of the arabidopsis thaliana pfkb members identified eight highly related predicted proteins including one with previously demonstrated frk activity . for one the predicted open reading frame is half the size of active frks and only incompletely spliced rnas were identified which led to a premature stop codon both indicating that this gene does not produce active frk . the remaining seven proteins were _PROTEIN_ in e. coli and phosphorylated fructose specifically in vitro leading us to propose a unifying nomenclature _PROTEIN_ . substrate inhibition was observed for fructose in all frks except _PROTEIN_ . fructose binding was on the same order of magnitude for _PROTEIN_ between and . was an outlier with a fructose km of . _PROTEIN_ binding was similar for all frks and ranged between and . _METHOD_ tagged atfrks were _LOCATION_ except _LOCATION_ . t dna alleles with non detectable wild type rnas in five of the seven active frk genes produced no overt phenotype . we extended our sequence comparisons to include putative frks encoded in other plant sequenced genomes . we observed that different subgroups expanded subsequent to speciation . arabidopsis thaliana as well as all other plant species analyzed contain multiple copies of genes encoding frk activity . sequence comparisons among multiple species identified a minimal set of three distinct frks present on all species investigated including a _LOCATION_ localized form . the selective expansion of specific isozymes results in differences in frk gene number among species . atfrks exhibit substrate inhibition typical of their mammalian counterparts with the single lacking this property suggesting it may have a distinct in vivo role . results presented here provide a starting point for the engineering of specific frks to affect _METHOD_ production .
arsova et al . determined that one member of the pfkb family of proteins in arabidopsis thaliana ecotype col encoded in therein named was an active frk after _PROTEIN_ of the recombinant protein in e. coli . to determine whether other pfkb enzymes in arabidopsis are active frks we first generated a phylogenetic tree based on an alignment of the amino acid sequences of the putative pfkb family members in arabidopsis to determine whether and which other pfkb proteins clade with . several clades with members and one large sub family were apparent . one clade contained the two characterized adenosine kinases _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . approximately half of the arabidopsis pfkb proteins are un characterized so the functional significance of these phylogenetic groupings remains uncertain . the one large sub family contained sequences from nine proteins divided into two branches . one branch within this clade comprised the two fructokinase like proteins _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ for which no kinase activity has been detected . the other branch comprised seven proteins including . an eighth putative pfkb family member was excluded from these analyses because it was found to be a pseudogene . two peptide sequences that were present in the inclusive branch and were both designated in different publications . we have chosen to denote as because of its similarity to the tomato as previously noted . is designated here . _PROTEIN_ and were previously annotated due to their similarity to the tomato isozymes . to visualize specific regions of highest identity we aligned the peptide sequences of the seven putative arabidopsis frk proteins . was predicted to contain a chloroplast transit peptide by the chlorop software and the predicted ctp was removed for the alignment . of the amino acids are identical between all seven members of the putative frk branch . both the gg and g/axgd motifs underlined in red and green respectively were conserved in all members and notably the g/axgd motif was in the form gagd in all members.fig . of seven putative arabidopsis thaliana frk enzymes . a consensus bootstrap phylogenetic tree of the pfkb proteins in arabidopsis . the seven

protein is only kda while other frks range from kda . the kda protein is missing at least half of the lid domain and alpha helices in the large domain . in addition there is no evidence that this gene is _PROTEIN_ based on data from tair and genvestigator . according to the gene model includes three introns but two independent cdnas synthesized from total arabidopsis ecotype col seedling rna contained sequences identical to the predicted first intron . as a result the cdna contains an in frame stop codon encoded in the unspliced first intron . if this mrna were translated the protein would be kda and lack a functional lid and the catalytic residues . based on these data we conclude that does not _PROTEIN_ a functional protein in col and thus have not included it in our phylogenetic or biochemical analyses.fig . produces an mrna encoding a non functional protein . a schematic of the predicted gene model and experimentally determined cdna . exons and introns are

underlined in green cdnas for the remaining seven predicted proteins were either isolated from col cdna or obtained from the arabidopsis biological resource center and sequenced to verify the predicted orfs . all seven orfs matched the representative gene models and contained both signature motifs characteristic of pfkb proteins . to verify whether the seven members of the putative frk clade exhibit frk activity we _PROTEIN_ each protein in e. coli with and _PROTEIN_ epitope tags and purified them using ni agarose resin . since the substrate specificity of known pfkb family proteins varies greatly we measured nadh oxidation as a proxy for frk activity in the presence of an _PROTEIN_ regeneration system in pools of _PROTEIN_ substrates . no change in nadh concentration was seen for any of the proteins in a reaction mixture containing fructose phosphate sucrose and n acetyl mannosamine suggesting that none of the putative frks could phosphorylate any of these _PROTEIN_ . similarly the proteins were not active in the presence of ribose xylose and arabinose . in contrast nadh oxidation was observed in the presence of _PROTEIN_ fructose fucose and tagatose suggesting that one or more of these sugars is a substrate . when these _PROTEIN_ were parsed fucose _PROTEIN_ or tagatose alone produced no change in nadh concentration . however all seven enzymes were active in the presence of fructose suggesting that each of the seven enzymes possesses frk activity and that their activity is specific for fructose . the two proteins that comprise the most closely related phylogenetic branch _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ lack detectable fructokinase activity and the only biochemically characterized enzyme in the unresolved polytomy of proteins related to the frk clade specifically phosphorylates ribose suggesting that the seven frks identified herein likely comprise the arabidopsis frk family . as such we propose the nomenclature in table based on previously defined nomenclature and degree of similarities among the arabidopsis proteins and we will use it in the remainder of this manuscript.fig . of putative arabidopsis frk enzymes from e. coli . _METHOD_

. points represent the mean of three technical replicates and _LOCATION_ bars indicate _PROTEIN_ we then assessed the cofactor requirements of a subset of arabidopsis frks _PROTEIN_ . unlike other pfkb proteins most notably the ribokinases and adenosine kinases arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ were not significantly sensitive to the absence of inorganic phosphate from the reaction mixture . because potassium ions activate pfkb family members via creation of an anion hole in their active site we tested whether arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ were activated to the same extent upon the substitution of sodium for potassium as the monovalent cation in the reaction mixture . replacement with sodium resulted in the reduced activity of _PROTEIN_ by roughly of their respective activities in the presence of potassium . since magnesium is known to be required for _PROTEIN_ dependent phosphorylation reactions we next tested whether or not magnesium is required for frk activity . magnesium was omitted from the reaction mixture and edta was added to chelate any magnesium that may have co purified with the enzymes . _PROTEIN_ activity was completely lost in the reaction mixture containing edta . other frk enzymes can use other nucleotide triphosphates besides _PROTEIN_ as kinase substrates albeit with _PROTEIN_ effectiveness . accordingly _PROTEIN_ activity _PROTEIN_ by activity in the presence of mm _PROTEIN_ while activities were approximately halved . substitution of _PROTEIN_ with mm utp resulted in the loss of and approximately of _PROTEIN_ and activities respectively .fig . subset of

arabidopsis we acquired arabidopsis plants harboring t dna mediated gene disruption mutants for five of the seven frks . each mutant line was confirmed homozygous for the t dna insertion in the respective gene and none of the t dna insertional mutants made authentic transcripts for their respective disrupted frk gene . after days of growth on soil there was no difference in rosette diameter among any of the single frk mutants or wt control plants suggesting a lack of vegetative phenotype and possible redundancy between some of the frks.fig . t dna insertional mutants exhibit no growth

visualized the intracellular localization of frks _PROTEIN_ as c terminal yellow _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ fusions transiently in tobacco leaves and examined by confocal microscopy . the majority of a plant cell s cytoplasm comprises the _LOCATION_ such that the _LOCATION_ is compressed between the _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . _LOCATION_ proteins therefore appear around the edges of cells by microscopy as seen for a known _METHOD_ tagged _LOCATION_ protein _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was observed in the _LOCATION_ as the _METHOD_ signal was most abundant around the edges of cells with apparent _LOCATION_ bridges connecting parts of the cell . the same was true for _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ . as mentioned previously was predicted to contain a ctp and therefore predicted to be

frks with those of other plant species with sequenced genomes including medicago truncatula oryza sativa solanum lycospersicum populus trichocarpa zea mays brachypodium distaychon and physcomitrella patens . we then created a phylogenetic tree using all protein sequences along with all arabidopsis pfkb sequences . we included all proteins that were within one branch from any of the seven active arabidopsis frks . this yielded protein sequences comprised of seven from arabidopsis from medicago three from rice four from tomato four from populus four from brachypodium eight from maize and eight from physcomitrella . several interesting relationships were apparent from the resulting phylogenetic tree comprised of the confirmed and putative frks . all physcomitrella sequences were confined to two clades and interestingly those clades included physcomitrella sequences only indicating that physcomitrella frk sequences are more similar to each other than they are to frks from other species . there were two clades that included a single sequence from all other species excluding physcomitrella . one clade contains and the second includes . another large clade includes four arabidopsis proteins as well as sequences from poplar tomato and medicago but does not include any sequences from a monocot species . similarly another clade contains _PROTEIN_ and a tomato sequence as well as two poplar sequences and six medicago sequences that are more distantly related and no monocot proteins . there is one weakly separated monocot specific clade with four maize sequences and one each from rice and brachypodium . a few monocot proteins seem equidistant from all other pfkbs.fig . of putative frk enzymes from multiple species . consensus bootstrap phylogenetic tree of putative frk
