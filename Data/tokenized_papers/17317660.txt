perception of general elicitors by plant cells initiates signal transduction cascades that are regulated by protein phosphorylation . the earliest signaling events occur within minutes and include ion fluxes across the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ activation of mapks and the formation of reactive oxygen species . the phosphorylation events that regulate these signaling cascades are largely unknown . here we present a _METHOD_ _METHOD_ based quantitative phosphoproteomics approach that identified differentially phosphorylated sites in signaling and response proteins from arabidopsis cells treated with either or xylanase . our approach was sensitive enough to quantitate phosphorylation on low abundance signaling proteins such as calcium dependent protein kinases and receptor like kinase family members . with this approach we identified one or more differentially phosphorylated sites in _LOCATION_ associated proteins including a number of defense related proteins . our data on phosphorylation indicate a high degree of complexity at the level of post translational modification as exemplified by the complex modification patterns of respiratory burst oxidase protein d. furthermore the data also suggest that protein translocation and vesicle traffic are important aspects of early signaling and defense in response to general elicitors . our study presents the largest quantitative arabidopsis phosphoproteomics data set to date and provides a new resource that can be used to gain novel insight into plant defense signal transduction and early defense response .
perception of general elicitors occurs at the external side of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and sets in motion a signal transduction cascade . we used flagellin peptide and xylanase as general elicitors to activate early signal transduction in arabidopsis suspension cultured cells . perception of or xylanase activates map kinases in arabidopsis suspension cultured cells within minutes map kinase activity peaks within min and diminishes after min . based on these activation kinetics we chose min incubation with or xylanase for our further experiments . the initial signaling events are likely to occur at the _LOCATION_ face of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ so we set out to identify signal transduction proteins associated with the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . this strategy resulted in a considerable reduction in complexity of the proteome and allowed us to focus on the earliest signaling events . we used aqueous two phase partitioning to obtain purified _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ vesicles . to verify the efficiency of the method we analyzed the crude microsomal samples and purified pm samples by western blot probed with antibodies specific for marker proteins of different cellular compartments . this showed a significant enrichment for pm proteins whereas mitochondrial and _LOCATION_ proteins were almost entirely absent from the pm sample . from these pm vesicles we prepared a tryptic digest of the _LOCATION_ domain using the vesicle shaving method .to obtain further reduction in complexity of the sample trypsin digested peptides were fractioned using scx under acidic conditions which separates phosphopeptides from the majority of the non phosphopeptides due to differences in solution state charge . subsequently each fraction was separately enriched for phosphopeptides using affinity chromatography in the presence of high concentrations of dihydroxybenzoic acid . fig . shows that early scx fractions consisted almost entirely of singly phosphorylated peptides after enrichment whereas _PROTEIN_ fractions also contained a significant number of multiple phosphorylated as well non phosphorylated peptides . of the detected phosphopeptides we identified mostly phosphorylated ser and thr residues thr supplemental table v and only a few phosphorylated tyr residues . a more detailed description of the analytical performance of the enrichment strategy and the physiochemical properties of all identified peptides is provided in the supplemental data . the comparative analysis of protein sample by _METHOD_ is hampered by the _PROTEIN_ that sample preparation purification strategies and _METHOD_ analysis results in semiquantitative data at best . to overcome these limitations two different samples can be tagged with different _METHOD_ labels and analyzed together . this allows for a pairwise comparison of signal intensities for each peptide in the sample similar to the use of different _METHOD_ dyes during competitive hybridization in microarray experiments . as extraction efficiencies can be different between samples optimal quantitative accuracy is achieved when the two samples are tagged and combined prior to the extraction . this can be achieved by growing cells on medium containing specific amino acids or on a basal salt medium containing as a sole nitrogen source so called metabolic labeling . silac a metabolic labeling method that uses labeled lysine and arginine is an elegant method to achieve in vivo tagged proteins where the _METHOD_ shift between the two isotopic _METHOD_ of the peptide is independent of their size or sequence this strongly simplifies the quantitation procedure . however due to autonomous production of these amino acids in plant cells only partial incorporation can be achieved in arabidopsis . in contrast krijgsveld et al . achieved incorporation in caenorhabditis elegans fed with escherichia coli grown on medium enriched in . metabolic labeling with is even better suited for labeling of plant cell cultures which can be grown directly on a basal salt medium containing as a sole nitrogen source . to test this we grew arabidopsis cell cultures in liquid medium containing or and analyzed isotope incorporation rates by _METHOD_ four subculture periods of days resulted in almost complete incorporation of into randomly selected proteins . to identify phosphorylated proteins involved in early elicitor signaling and defense response in arabidopsis we induced cells grown on medium with or xylanase for min and pooled the cells with an equal amount of grown cells that where mock treated . the pooled cells were homogenized pm vesicles were purified and phosphopeptides were isolated as described above . to obtain biologically relevant high confidence data we also performed an inverse labeling experiment with elicitor induction of the grown cells and mock treatment of the grown cells for both elicitors . individual scx fractions enriched in phosphopeptides with titanium oxide were analyzed by lc _METHOD_ . analysis of phosphopeptides by tandem _METHOD_ is often hindered by the preferential loss of phosphoric acid upon fragmentation of precursor ions often resulting in a predominant neutral loss ion n . this hinders sequence annotation and prevents the identification of phosphopeptides and phosphorylation sites . to overcome these limitations we performed _METHOD_ spectrometric analysis on an ltq _PROTEIN_ icr _METHOD_ spectrometer . such an instrument provides several advantages when required to perform identification and localization of phosphorylated residues including high dynamic range and _METHOD_ accuracy as well as allowing multiple levels of tandem _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . this latter feature allows the further sequencing of dominant neutral loss peak by _METHOD_ . recently _METHOD_ has been used to good effect to identify phosphorylated peptides in yeast . each of our phosphopeptide enriched samples was subjected to an lc _METHOD_ analysis that included _METHOD_ scans that were initiated when the neutral loss of phosphoric acid was detected . analyses including _METHOD_ scans can significantly reduce the number of peptides that are sequenced during an lc run and so to acquire the most comprehensive analysis of each sample a regular _METHOD_ analysis was also performed . fig . shows an example of an _METHOD_ analysis of a phosphopeptide with neutral loss dependent _METHOD_ scan . the left spectrum shows an _PROTEIN_ icr _METHOD_ scan containing the and peaks for rgnpssndhelgilr of _PROTEIN_ from an sample . from this spectrum the ratio between and labeled versions of the peptide can be determined it reflects the relative level of phosphorylation in the treated culture as compared with the mock treated culture . the middle spectrum shows the _METHOD_ of precursor ion that was isolated and fragmented in the ltq . the predominant _METHOD_ in this spectrum corresponds to the neutral loss ion . the right spectrum shows the corresponding _METHOD_ after isolation and fragmentation of the neutral loss ion in the ltq . from this spectrum the amino acid sequence and position of the phosphorylated residue were determined . the corresponding peak was analyzed in an identical manner by independent _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ providing independent amino acid sequence information and annotation of the phosphorylated residue . a general survey of our induced and xylanase induced data sets shows that we identified a total of arabidopsis proteins from our _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ enriched fractions . a little less then half of these were predicted to have at least one transmembrane domain . comparison of the data with three other proteomics data sets obtained from purified _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ vesicles isolated with aqueous two phase partitioning showed about overlap with the data set that also used arabidopsis suspension cells . _LOCATION_ extracts from whole plants show only a overlap with data presented here . a comparison against a recent large scale localization study of arabidopsis organelle proteins showed an overlap of proteins with our data set . of these proteins were classified as pm were classified as _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ were classified as _LOCATION_ were classified as _LOCATION_ and another were not classified in this lopit analysis . overall this comparison correlates well with the data presented in fig . and indicates that our samples are highly enriched in pm proteins . in addition to the observed overlap with these four published proteomics data sets we also identified a substantial number of novel _LOCATION_ associated proteins . despite the high level of enrichment of our _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ preparations we like nuhse et al . also did observe a small number of potential contaminants such as dna binding proteins . in our data sets we identified a total of phosphopeptides including new phosphopeptides each with one or more phosphorylated residues . we observed a substantial overlap in identified phosphopeptides between our two data sets . almost of all phosphopeptides identified in the xylanase treated cells were also found in the treated cells . however there were also a considerable amount of phosphopeptides found in only one of the data sets . this is likely due to the _PROTEIN_ that _METHOD_ analysis of complex peptide samples is unlikely to give full coverage of all peptides in the mixture . comparison of the data with another proteomics data set obtained from purified _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ vesicles isolated with aqueous two phase partitioning and selective phosphopeptide enrichment also showed about overlap . min exposure of arabidopsis cells to general elicitors resulted in significant induction of map kinase activity . with a short induction time we aimed to induce only post translational modifications and expected to limit the contribution of transcription and translation to any observed changes in protein phosphorylation and protein abundance . we analyzed the changes in protein abundance by calculating the ratio of each peptide in the elicitor treated samples versus mock treated samples . a total of peak pairs were compared using _METHOD_ and a ratio of elicitor treated versus mock treated was determined for all of these . for peptides we were able to identify a ratio in both biological replicas and of these peptides had one or more phosphorylated residues . to identify proteins that were differentially phosphorylated in response to either xylanase or both elicitors we normalized the ratios of the non phosphorylated peptides and phosphopeptides found in both biological replicas of the inverse labeling experiment . as a result of the normalization the average ratios of non phosphorylated peptides in both data sets were distributed around . more than of non phosphopeptides had a ratio that remained within standard deviations of the mean .this indicates that at min after elicitation only a very few proteins changed in abundance . we detected five proteins with a significant change in abundance in both replicas in the sample . as none of these proteins are obvious transmembrane proteins the observed change in abundance is likely due to translocation to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ or de novo protein synthesis . we presuppose that translocation of protein to or from the _LOCATION_ is the major contributor to this phenomenon because dramatic increases in de novo protein synthesis are unprecedented at min after addition of an elicitor . translocation of _LOCATION_ proteins to the _LOCATION_ has been reported previously in response to both race specific and general elicitors . our data suggest that translocation of these proteins to _LOCATION_ is an immediate response that may be integral to elicitor signal transduction or elicitor induced immediate defense response in plants . more importantly our data showed that the overwhelming majority of the proteins present in both biological replicas show no changes in abundance at min after induction with elicitors . the normalized average ratios of the phosphopeptides were also distributed around but the fraction of phosphopeptides with a ratio that remained within standard deviations of the mean was much smaller especially for the data set . this data distribution together with the data distribution of the non phosphopeptides suggested that the observed ratios for the phosphopeptides are almost entirely due to changes in phosphorylation status and not due to changes in protein abundance . this was further evaluated by comparing the ratios of the phosphopeptides to ratios of non phosphopeptides from the same proteins when these were available . of the comparisons we were able to do only three comparisons indicated that the observed differential ratio for the phosphopeptide could also have been due to an increase in protein abundance . the three corresponding proteins were therefore not considered to be differentially phosphorylated . together the distribution analysis and the ratio comparison show that the vast majority of differential ratios for the phosphopeptides are caused by differential phosphorylation of the corresponding proteins . from our two data sets we identified proteins that were phosphorylated on one or more residues . the majority of these proteins were not identified previously as phosphoproteins . when compared with the only other large scale protein phosphorylation analysis study we found a significant number of proteins present in their data set that are also present as phosphoproteins in our data set . this was anticipated as nuhse et al . extracted phosphopeptides from uninduced cells combined with cells induced with for min . however these authors were unable to distinguish between phosphorylated residues from untreated and elicitor induced cells . using our metabolic labeling strategy we could identify one or more differentially phosphorylated residues in at least phosphopeptides corresponding to proteins . we considered peptides to be differentially phosphorylated when we were able to identify the corresponding phosphopeptides in both biological replicas and when these phosphopeptides had a normalized ratio that was at least standard deviations away from the mean . these selection criteria were used to ensure that we obtained high confidence data sets with differentially phosphorylated peptides . a further measure of the confidence level of these data sets is the consistent reproducibility of the ratios in the two biological replicas as visualized in a x y scatter plot . overall the ratios from biological replica match the amplitude and direction of change of the ratios from biological replica for both elicitor treatments with only a few outliers in each set . furthermore this consistent reproducibility is also evident from the small s.e . values of the ratios in table ii . functional classification of the differentially phosphorylated proteins identified a substantial number of proteins involved in signal transduction . these include ion channels calcium _PROTEIN_ calmodulins protein kinases protein phosphatases and receptor like kinases . a substantial number of the differentially phosphorylated proteins are enzymes involved in protein phosphorylation/dephosphorylation including members of different families of kinases receptor like kinases _PROTEIN_ and protein phosphatases . among these we could identify proteins that have been implicated previously in defense responses . one such example is botrytis induced _PROTEIN_ which codes a _LOCATION_ anchored protein kinase that was shown recently to be required for basal defense . in the present study we showed that this protein is phosphorylated on ser and dephosphorylated at ser in response to suggesting that the changes in phosphorylation status of these residues are important for elicitor induced activation and by inference for basal defense . our screen identified at least three cdpks that are differentially phosphorylated in response to . previously cdpks have been shown be activated in response to fungal elicitors in french bean cells and in nicotiana benthamiana in response to race specific elicitor . the _PROTEIN_ that three different cdpks were differentially phosphorylated in response to points to the central role this class of protein kinases plays in defense signal transduction . it is also interesting to note that four _PROTEIN_ were differentially phosphorylated in response to . these four _PROTEIN_ do not include _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ that is required for perception . we did not identify any phosphopeptides corresponding to _PROTEIN_ although we did identify one non phosphorylated _PROTEIN_ peptide in our data set . phosphorylated _PROTEIN_ is rapidly internalized and degraded upon binding as recently described by robatzek et al . . perhaps this prevented detection of _PROTEIN_ phosphopeptides in our study and resulted in detection of unmodified _PROTEIN_ only . however it is equally likely that we could not detect the _PROTEIN_ phosphopeptides due to incomplete peptide coverage . nevertheless what could be the significance of the observed increased phosphorylation of multiple other _PROTEIN_ ? by phosphorylating multiple _PROTEIN_ in response to the perception of the cell may prepare for the perception of other general elicitors and go into a primed state that will allow a faster defense response resulting in enhanced resistance . was recently shown to induce enhanced resistance to p. syringae pv . tomato in arabidopsis plants with a functional _PROTEIN_ protein . priming of basal defense has been described previously for resistance induced by root colonizing non pathogenic pseudomonads in arabidopsis . several bacterial determinants inducing induced systemic resistance like resistance in arabidopsis have been described previously and include lipopolysaccharide and flagellin isolated from induced systemic resistance inducing pseudomonads . however the molecular mechanism behind this priming for enhanced resistance has so far not been elucidated . we postulate that perception of a general elicitor like induces local priming through the phosphorylation of multiple _PROTEIN_ resulting in enhanced _PROTEIN_ mediated detection of pathogens that ultimately leads to the described enhanced defense response . other proteins that were differentially phosphorylated and have an established link with defense response include the respiratory oxidative burst proteins _PROTEIN_ abc transporter _PROTEIN_ and cellulose synthase _PROTEIN_ . most proteins identified as differentially phosphorylated in this study however have no known link with defense responses or have been characterized previously to be involved in other signaling pathways or responses . among these are a number of proteins that are involved in mediating auxin response including _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and abc transporter _PROTEIN_ . from our data it is not apparent what the physiological significance of the differential phosphorylation of these proteins is however recently has been shown to modulate auxin response . in arabidopsis suspension cells and seedlings a min induction with has been shown to cause down regulation of many auxin signaling related genes . furthermore down regulation of auxin signaling was shown to enhance resistance to virulent pseudomonas suggesting that down regulation of the auxin signaling is part of the plant immune response . it was suggested by the authors that mediated down regulation of auxin responses could be responsible for the induced growth inhibition in arabidopsis seedling roots . it has been reported previously that activation of a mapk pathway involving mapk kinase kinase and unidentified mapks negatively regulates auxin responsive gene _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis . because induces the activation of multiple mapk activities the differentially phosphorylated auxin response proteins may be direct or indirect targets of map kinases . map kinases phosphorylate serine or threonine residues followed by a proline in both plant and animal _METHOD_ . three of the differentially phosphorylated auxin signaling proteins _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ have phosphorylated ser or thr residues followed by pro suggesting that these proteins may qualify as direct mapk targets . thus mapk dependent induced phosphorylation of one or more of these auxin signaling proteins could possibly play a role in the negative regulation of auxin signaling in arabidopsis to enhance the plants immune response . in addition to the elicitor induced phosphorylation described above we also detected elicitor induced dephosphorylation of a substantial number of proteins . most notably two h _PROTEIN_ showed a fold reduction in phosphorylation upon treatment . furthermore two cellulose synthase proteins _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were also dephosphorylated in response to . in almost all of these proteins other non phosphorylated peptides were also detected and showed no change in abundance indicating that these proteins are dephosphorylated in response to elicitor . previously a reduction in _PROTEIN_ levels or _PROTEIN_ activity was shown to induce jasmonate and ethylene accumulation and invoke defense gene _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis linking reductions in cellulose synthesis to defense responses . because perception of also induces the deposition of callose in arabidopsis seedlings the observed dephosphorylation of _PROTEIN_ proteins could indicate that the modulation of cellulose synthesis is related to a switch to defensive callose synthesis . we detected proteins in both biological replicas that showed differential phosphorylation upon treatment with either xylanase or . significantly three of the six proteins that were differentially phosphorylated in response to xylanase were also differentially phosphorylated in response to . an additional proteins were identified that were potentially differentially phosphorylated in response to xylanase and of these were also potentially differentially phosphorylated in response to . however the corresponding phosphopeptides could not be verified in both biological replicas . this could be due to technical limitations as _METHOD_ analysis of complex peptide mixtures results in partial coverage of the sample and preferential detection of some peptides but not others . however two of the three differentially phosphorylated proteins _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ have well established links to defense responses and their differential phosphorylation in response to both elicitors indicates their conserved function in different defense signal transduction cascades . the abc transporter _PROTEIN_ was originally isolated as a mutant locus that permitted penetration and infection by non _PROTEIN_ fungi . this protein was differentially phosphorylated on two residues in response to both elicitors . significantly a related abc transporter was also differentially phosphorylated in response to on an almost identical location . recently it has been suggested that _PROTEIN_ protein functions to export toxic compounds at the site of pathogen infection and the phosphorylation sites we identified here may very well be involved in the activation of _PROTEIN_ like abc transporters in response to general elicitor perception . the majority of the differentially phosphorylated proteins we identified have no experimentally defined function . however a small number of the proteins we identified as differentially phosphorylated in response to or xylanase have been described previously as required for defense signaling or defense response . one of these proteins is the respiratory oxidative burst protein _PROTEIN_ . respiratory oxidative burst is defined as the production of apoplastic reactive oxygen intermediates which is mediated by nadph oxidases and apoplastic peroxidase and is a hallmark of successful pathogen recognition in plants . nadph oxidases represented in a small family in arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ are implicated as one of the sources of roi production . rboh genes are transcriptionally up regulated upon pathogen attack and antisense reduction of _PROTEIN_ in nicotiana led to reduced production of rois and higher susceptibility to infection . although rois were originally proposed to orchestrate cell death upon infection recent evidence showed that mutations in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ required for roi production in arabidopsis leaves have only a small effect on the hypersensitive response and roi production can even suppress cell death rather than induce it . in response to arabidopsis leaves with functional _PROTEIN_ produce reactive oxygen species within minutes and this oxidative burst peaks around min . in response to a min incubation with and xylanase we observed phosphorylation on seven different residues in _PROTEIN_ three of which showed increased phosphorylation upon xylanase and treatment . as multiple non phosphorylated peptides were also detected for this protein the changes in phosphorylation can safely be attributed to phosphorylation rather than increased amount of protein . in general both elicitors induce phosphorylation at similar locations although tends to induce a stronger quantitative phosphorylation . these data show that _PROTEIN_ is very tightly regulated by phosphorylation as many residues were differentially phosphorylated in response to or xylanase and three residues were differentially phosphorylated in response to both . a further four potential differentially phosphorylated residues were identified in one biological replica but could not be verified in the other biological replica . detailed characterization of _PROTEIN_ point mutation versions of the protein _PROTEIN_ in a _PROTEIN_ mutant background will be required to fully characterize the significance of the differentially phosphorylated residues in response to general elicitors or pathogen infection . because there are multiple residues in _PROTEIN_ that become quantitatively phosphorylated in response to general elicitors it is likely that the activity of _PROTEIN_ is regulated by several different kinases acting in sequential or parallel pathways activated in response to general elicitor perception . another class of proteins associated with defense response and differentially phosphorylated in response to is syntaxins . syntaxin _PROTEIN_ also known as _PROTEIN_ is required for non host resistance against non _PROTEIN_ fungi . non host resistance to non _PROTEIN_ fungi was shown recently to be comprised of pre and postinvasion defense . the postinvasion defense is dependent on the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ signaling complex whereas preinvasion defensive layers where shown to require _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . lipka et al . suggested that both preinvasion defense and postinvasion defense are probably inducible upon pathogen perception and may be mediated through pathogen associated molecular pattern or general elicitor receptors . this was in part based on the observation that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is induced in response to perception . our data on differential phosphorylation of abc transporter _PROTEIN_ in response to both and xylanase suggest that preinvasion defense may also be regulated at the post translational level . furthermore we found that _PROTEIN_ is also phosphorylated on the n terminus upon treatment . phosphorylation of the same peptide was not increased upon xylanase treatment . for a related syntaxin _PROTEIN_ we identified three phosphorylated peptides with a total of four phosphorylation sites in the treated cells . syntaxin _PROTEIN_ was shown previously to be phosphorylated on a specific residue in response to treatment . we also observed a differentially phosphorylated peptide in which two residues were phosphorylated . in addition we also observed a phosphopeptide in which only ser was phosphorylated but this peptide did not have a differential ratio . this suggests that under our conditions ser may not be differentially phosphorylated in response to but that it is ser that becomes phosphorylated in response to . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ encode soluble n ethylmaleimide sensitive _PROTEIN_ attachment protein receptor domain containing and _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ resident syntaxins which become recruited into _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ microdomains beneath incipient fungal entry sites . _PROTEIN_ was originally isolated as a mediator in fungal penetration and was reported recently to have a basal function in secretion and a specialized defense related function . because snare proteins play a key role in vesicle trafficking in eukaryotic cells these findings have been interpreted as evidence for the existence of a vesicle associated resistance mechanism preventing powdery mildew ingress . in addition to _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ we also identified other proteins involved in vesicle transport to be differentially phosphorylated in response to and or xylanase . both elicitors induced phosphorylation of a kinesin motor protein and a second kinesin was also phosphorylated in response to xylanase treatment . kinesin motor proteins have been described to be involved in vesicle transport along microtubules . furthermore the dynamin like protein _PROTEIN_ was also phosphorylated in response to xylanase and _PROTEIN_ was phosphorylated in response to . dynamins are mechanochemical _PROTEIN_ that form multimeric _PROTEIN_ around the necks of budding clathrin coated vesicles . taken together the data on differential phosphorylation of vesicle transport associated proteins implicate vesicle traffic as an important response upon general elicitor perception and some of these proteins may turn out to be part of the preinvasive defensive layer described by lipka et al . . the recently reported ligand induced endocytosis of the receptor _PROTEIN_ further illustrates the importance of vesicle traffic in elicitor induced responses . binding induces the internalization of _PROTEIN_ and its subsequent degradation and this process is dependent on protein kinase activity . we did not observe any changes in _PROTEIN_ protein abundance in our experiments but this may be due to the earlier time point we chose as compared with the earliest time reported for _PROTEIN_ internalization . however our combined data point to the phosphorylation dependent regulation of endocytosis and vesicle traffic in response to general elicitor perception . using a stable isotope metabolic labeling strategy combined with selective purification of phosphopeptides and lc _METHOD_ we were able to identify a large number of protein phosphorylation events in arabidopsis cells . with this newly established method we identified novel phosphorylation sites in many pm associated proteins and showed that some of these are differentially phosphorylated in response to general elicitors . these differentially phosphorylated proteins are all potential new signal transduction components or early response regulators and provide a wealth of information on early signaling and response in arabidopsis cells . functional analysis of these proteins by site directed mutagenesis of the identified phosphorylation residues or reverse genetic approaches will now be required to validate their role in elicitor signaling . our strategy can also be applied to other stress conditions or responses to environmental changes to identify possible early signal transduction proteins thereby elucidating other signal transduction networks in plants . our study has provided the largest quantitative arabidopsis phosphoproteomics data set to date and reveals that the plant 's early response at the protein level is primarily at the level of post translational modifications . by just zooming in on phosphorylation the data set reveals that the response to an elicitor by the plant is a complex multifaceted interplay of many signaling pathways indicating that a comprehensive system biology approach is needed to understand the full mechanism . quantitative phosphoproteomics as described in this study is a novel tool that can complement ongoing genomics and reverse genetic approaches to identify the molecular mechanism of regulation of newly discovered and established plant signal transduction components and early response proteins .
