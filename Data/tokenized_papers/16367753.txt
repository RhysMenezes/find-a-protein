sulfotransferases catalyse the transfer of a sulfate group from _PROTEIN_ to an appropriate hydroxy group of various substrates with the parallel formation of . in arabidopsis thaliana sot proteins _PROTEIN_ have been identified . three of them _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ catalyse the sulfation of desulfoglucosinolates . the proteins were _PROTEIN_ in escherichia coli purified by affinity chromatography and used for enzyme kinetic studies . by establishing two types of enzyme assay using both and unlabelled _PROTEIN_ separation of the products by hplc and detection of the products by monitoring radioactivity or uv absorption the substrate specificities of the three _PROTEIN_ proteins were determined . they show different maximum velocities with several desulfoglucosinolates as substrates and differ in their affinity for desulfobenzylglucosinolate and _PROTEIN_ . the sequences encoding _PROTEIN_ were amplified from arabidopsis ecotypes _PROTEIN_ and the two _PROTEIN_ proteins differ in two out of amino acids . these variations led to different substrate specificities . exchange of one of the two amino acids in _PROTEIN_ from _PROTEIN_ to the respective amino acid in _PROTEIN_ from gave the _PROTEIN_ protein the same substrate specificity as the _PROTEIN_ protein from . all three desulfoglucosinolate _PROTEIN_ proteins are localized in the cytoplasm as demonstrated by transient _PROTEIN_ of fusion constructs with the green _METHOD_ protein in arabidopsis protoplasts . northern blot analysis indicated differential _PROTEIN_ of the three _PROTEIN_ genes in plant organs and tissues at different developmental stages and during a light/darkness cycle . high and low sulfate concentrations in the medium did not influence the levels of _PROTEIN_ .
the _PROTEIN_ pattern differs among the various arabidopsis ecotypes . as the ecotype _PROTEIN_ has the broadest variety of _PROTEIN_ representing all chemical groups except aromatic we decided to study the three putative sot proteins from ecotype _PROTEIN_ and for comparison one sot protein from ecotype . the dna sequence encoding the _PROTEIN_ protein isolated from ecotype _PROTEIN_ showed identity with the available sequences in the databases . each sequence encoding the _PROTEIN_ proteins from ecotype _PROTEIN_ revealed one transition in comparison with published sequences from ecotype and _PROTEIN_ and also had one transversion . these replacements led to either one or two changes at the level compared with the primary sequences in ecotype . in _PROTEIN_ was replaced by l in _PROTEIN_ was replaced by r and by t and in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was replaced by g and by n. the replacement of v with l _PROTEIN_ and of s with t _PROTEIN_ should not cause any significant changes in the _PROTEIN_ structure of the proteins whereas the replacement of the nonpolar w with the _PROTEIN_ r and the charged d with the small g and the _PROTEIN_ l with the charged n may affect the _PROTEIN_ structure or the cavities . the putative _PROTEIN_ site was not changed . four conserved regions i iv which were speculated to have functional roles in soluble sot proteins have previously been defined . the amino acids in _PROTEIN_ and in _PROTEIN_ and in _PROTEIN_ are located after region iv at the of the protein . the replacement of by r in _PROTEIN_ is located in region ii and that of _PROTEIN_ by g in _PROTEIN_ between region iii and iv parts of the protein thought to be responsible for substrate binding . the predicted molecular _METHOD_ of the three _PROTEIN_ proteins from ecotype were kda for _PROTEIN_ consisting of amino acids kda for _PROTEIN_ and kda for _PROTEIN_ . at the level _PROTEIN_ showed identity with _PROTEIN_ and identity with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ shared identity with _PROTEIN_ . all four recombinant _PROTEIN_ proteins could be purified to homogeneity as estimated by the analysis of protein fractions on _PROTEIN_ polyacrylamide gels . to analyse the substrate specificities in vitro sot assays were performed as described by glendening poulton . the assay mixtures contained purified recombinant protein in mm tris/hcl ph mm and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and mm desulfoglucosinolate and were incubated for min at . the results of the assays using _PROTEIN_ have been published . only in the presence of nondenatured _PROTEIN_ and both substrates _PROTEIN_ and desulfoallyl _PROTEIN_ could the formation of the product the sulfated allyl _PROTEIN_ be detected by hplc analysis . the product was analysed by _METHOD_ which confirmed its identity . vmax was calculated as times higher than previously obtained using the same substrate . when the assay conditions described by glendening poulton were followed exactly only the recombinant _PROTEIN_ out of the four _PROTEIN_ and purified _PROTEIN_ proteins was shown to be active . furthermore it was only active with desulfoallyl _PROTEIN_ as substrate out of desulfoglucosinolates tested . therefore two strategies were applied optimizing the assay conditions for all four recombinant _PROTEIN_ proteins and increasing the sensitivity of the detection by using _PROTEIN_ . to determine the ph optimum activities in the ph range were tested the highest activities were measured at ph . a higher incubation temperature of instead of led to the formation of larger product peaks . in the absence of the enzyme activity itself was not impaired but hplc separation and peak shape were for unknown reasons negatively influenced therefore was always included in the assay buffer . in the first experiments inhibitory effects of higher _PROTEIN_ concentrations were observed . it was found that the _PROTEIN_ preparation also contained phosphoadenosine _PROTEIN_ which is known to inhibit the sot reaction . therefore almost pure _PROTEIN_ from another source was used in subsequent experiments . the concentration of the desulfoglucosinolates was reduced from mm to the same concentration as the cosubstrate because substrate concentrations close to mm were also found to have inhibitory effects . in parallel we attempted to increase the sensitivity of the enzyme assay by including _PROTEIN_ in addition to unlabelled _PROTEIN_ and to analyse the products with a radioactivity monitor connected in series with a uv detector . twelve desulfoglucosinolates were used as substrates in the assay in which _PROTEIN_ was included . for all of them product formation could be unequivocally detected . in the optimized nonradioactive assay product formation could be shown for eight substrates . therefore the sensitivity of the assay using _PROTEIN_ was slightly higher than the nonradioactive assay . the four different desulfoglucosinolate _PROTEIN_ proteins may exhibit different enzyme kinetics and/or different substrate specificities . comparisons of kinetic properties with a single substrate were performed using desulfobenzylglucosinolate because all four proteins showed catalytic activity with this substrate . the kinetic data were determined with either _PROTEIN_ or desulfobenzyl _PROTEIN_ as the variable substrate . for the determination of the km values data points using substrate concentrations in the range were included . for _PROTEIN_ the range was extended to . the results were obtained by fitting data to the michaelis menten equation . no enzyme inhibition was observed over the ranges of _PROTEIN_ and desulfobenzylglucosinolate concentration used . typical hyperbolic saturation was observed when _PROTEIN_ was the variable substrate . the vmax for desulfobenzylglucosinolate of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are in the same range whereas that of _PROTEIN_ is times lower . the results also reveal that the binding affinity of the donor substrate _PROTEIN_ and the acceptor substrate desulfobenzylglucosinolate to _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are the same whereas _PROTEIN_ has a higher affinity for _PROTEIN_ . it was not possible to determine a reliable km value for _PROTEIN_ because a sigmoid curve was obtained in the low concentration range . higher substrate and cosubstrate concentrations were inhibitory . to determine the substrate specificities enzyme assays were performed under identical conditions with the nonradioactive assay using the four recombinant _PROTEIN_ proteins and eight different purified desulfoglucosinolates . as an example hplc _METHOD_ with as substrate are shown in fig . . the peaks on the right represent the substrate peak the peaks on the left the product peaks . the four recombinant _PROTEIN_ proteins show different activities with as substrate using the same assay conditions . the results of the enzyme assays with the full range of substrates are summarized in table . _PROTEIN_ has a very broad substrate specificity and can sulfate all desulfoglucosinolates offered . both the and desulfoglucosinolates are accepted equally . _PROTEIN_ principally shows activity with the substrate desulfobenzylglucosinolate and to a much lower extent with the . _PROTEIN_ shows low activity with and with both aromatic desulfoglucosinolates tested . the _PROTEIN_ protein shows the highest activity with desulfobenzylglucosinolate and sulfates all desulfoglucosinolates and also the . in summary _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ possess broad substrate specificities whereas the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are active only with a small number of desulfoglucosinolates . to investigate the differences between _PROTEIN_ from ecotype _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ from ecotype the two amino acids in _PROTEIN_ were replaced separately by the respective amino acids in _PROTEIN_ resulting in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ protein showed a times higher specific activity with desulfobenzylglucosinolate than _PROTEIN_ comparable to the specific activity of _PROTEIN_ . the protein sulfated the same desulfoglucosinolates with velocities comparable to _PROTEIN_ . to date we have been unable to purify the _PROTEIN_ protein under native conditions . the results indicate a critical role for the glycine residue at position in substrate recognition . several publicly available _METHOD_ have been used to predict the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ and . for all three proteins localizations in _LOCATION_ were predicted with the highest probabilities whereas the second highest scores were given for a localization in the cytoplasm _PROTEIN_ and the chloroplast _PROTEIN_ . to confirm the in silico prediction results of all three _PROTEIN_ proteins fusions of the sequences encoding the proteins with the green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ encoding sequence were transformed in arabidopsis protoplasts . _PROTEIN_ has already been shown to remain in the cytoplasm . in the present study _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ also remained in the cytoplasm . transformations with fusion constructs encoding _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ proteins resulted in completely different images . therefore it can be concluded that none of these proteins contain a targeting peptide at either the or . in addition to different substrate specificities the three desulfoglucosinolate _PROTEIN_ genes investigated may have different roles in _PROTEIN_ metabolism because of their different _PROTEIN_ patterns . mrna transcript levels were assessed by northern blotting . as the dna sequences showed a high degree of similarity the specificity of the probes was tested by analysing reactions in southern blots using the respective plasmid dna . was almost undetectable among the three different desulfoglucosinolate _PROTEIN_ genes . the highest mrna amounts for _PROTEIN_ and were found in roots mrna coding for _PROTEIN_ was also easily detectable in roots but the _PROTEIN_ was much higher in mature leaves of the primary rosette . in young leaves the mrna levels for all three genes were about half those of the mature rosette leaves and _METHOD_ . in flowers the _PROTEIN_ levels were lower than in the other tissues analysed and even more reduced in siliques . in summary the _PROTEIN_ patterns of all three desulfoglucosinolate _PROTEIN_ genes show small but distinctive differences . a comparison of developmental stages of up to arabidopsis plants showed the mrna levels of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ to be maximum in the plants whereas in older plants the _PROTEIN_ levels _PROTEIN_ reaching a minimum in flowering plants . in contrast the mrna levels of _PROTEIN_ were low in the younger plants and were slightly elevated in the oldest plants harvested in weeks and . the influence of light on the _PROTEIN_ was investigated by following a h h darkness cycle of arabidopsis plants . a cycling of the _PROTEIN_ mrna levels was observed the highest mrna levels were determined at the end of the light phase and the lowest at the end of dark phase . the effects of a different sulfate concentration in the medium were investigated by germinating seeds in _METHOD_ medium with and sulfate concentrations and growing them for days . the arabidopsis plants grown at high and low sulfate were phenotypically identical . the levels of mrna encoding _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were almost the same at both sulfate concentrations .

pots containing substrate after days . plants were grown in the greenhouse in a h h darkness rhythm at a temperature of . when necessary additional light was provided for h a day to obtain a constant quantum fluence rate of . to obtain plant material from different tissues arabidopsis plants were grown for weeks in the greenhouse counted from the transfer into pots . plants were harvested and split into roots mature leaves of the primary rosette young leaves of the rosette _METHOD_ siliques and flowers . to investigate natural senescence arabidopsis plants were grown in the greenhouse for up to weeks and the parts above ground were cut every week . the oldest leaves were comparable to the stage as defined by lohmann et al . . plants were grown in a h h darkness cycle in a growth chamber at a quantum fluence rate of and a constant temperature of . to follow one complete diurnal cycle plant parts above ground were harvested every h for nearly days starting h after the onset of light . to investigate the influence of high and low sulfate concentrations in the growing medium arabidopsis seeds ecotype were germinated under sterile conditions and grown for days in a hydroponic culture system under sterile conditions in _METHOD_ medium prepared as described by murashige skoog . the medium contained modified sulfate concentrations of and respectively . the three genes under investigation _GENE_ _GENE_ and _GENE_ encoding _PROTEIN_ from arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ respectively do not contain any introns . therefore the coding sequences could be amplified from genomic dna isolated from arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ leaves with the qiagen dna extraction kit . the following primer pair was used to amplify a coding sequence for _PROTEIN_ primer extended by a kpni restriction site and primer extended by a psti restriction site . for the amplification of the coding sequence for _PROTEIN_ primer extended by a bamhi restriction site and primer extended by a sali restriction site were used . a cdna encoding _PROTEIN_ was amplified from genomic dna of arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ and also from the genomic library of arabidopsis as described . two amino acids in _PROTEIN_ were replaced as described . for the replacement of _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ the following primers were used and . for the replacement of with the following primers were used and . to obtain fusions with _METHOD_ either with the end of the _METHOD_ coding sequence _METHOD_ or with the end _METHOD_ the following primer pairs were used for the _PROTEIN_ fusion with the end of the _METHOD_ primer extended by a ncoi restriction site and primer extended by a bglii restriction site and for fusion of the _PROTEIN_ cdna with the end of the _METHOD_ primer extended by a ncoi restriction site and primer extended by a bglii restriction site . the following primer pairs were used for _PROTEIN_ fusions with the _METHOD_ sequence primer extended by a ncoi restriction site and primer extended by a bglii restriction site . the pcr contained mm dntps each primer mm redtaq and about template dna in a final volume of . before the start of the first pcr cycle the dna was denatured for s at followed by pcr cycles conducted for s at s at _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ and s at . the amplified pcr fragments were ligated into the _PROTEIN_ vector or into the _METHOD_ vectors and the vectors were introduced into the escherichia coli strain . all clones were sequenced at least twice from both sides to obtain overlapping sequences . the four different _PROTEIN_ proteins _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were _PROTEIN_ in e. coli and purified as described . the purity of the protein preparations was checked by _PROTEIN_ and subsequent _METHOD_ brilliant blue and silver staining . protein contents were determined by the method of bradford with bsa as a protein standard . the desulfo _METHOD_ of the parent _PROTEIN_ derived from methionine tryptophan and phenylalanine were prepared as described by graser et al . . in short the _PROTEIN_ were extracted by methanol from seeds of different plant species and purified on . the bound _PROTEIN_ were treated with sulfatase overnight and the desulfoglucosinolates obtained were eluted with methanol . individual desulfoglucosinolates were isolated by preparative hplc with fraction collection . the following _PROTEIN_ were used in the experiments in their desulfo _METHOD_ from b. napus from a. thaliana from _LOCATION_ sativa from alyssum maritimum from isatis tinctoria from nasturtium officinale from b. napus from a. thaliana from a. thaliana from a. thaliana and benzylglucosinolate from tropaeolum majus . in addition sinigrin also called allyl _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ and desulfated as described above . and were only used as substrates in the assays including _PROTEIN_ as cosubstrate whereas all other _PROTEIN_ were used in both assay types . structures of all arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ are shown in . the enzyme assays with recombinant proteins were set up in a modified way from that described by glendening poulton . during the optimization of the enzyme assay conditions of the purified recombinant proteins was used . different ph values and the effects of the addition of mm were tested . different _PROTEIN_ preparations were used and _PROTEIN_ was mixed in a molar ratio of with nonradioactive _PROTEIN_ . finally the assays contained mm tris/hcl ph mm _PROTEIN_ the respective substrate and purified protein . for the determination of the km values for desulfobenzylglucosinolate at least different substrate concentrations were used depending on their inhibitory effects in these assays the _PROTEIN_ concentrations were increased by various amounts to avoid limitation of the cosubstrate . the reaction was started by the addition of _PROTEIN_ incubated for min at and stopped by incubation for min at . the formation of the respective sulfated product was analysed by hplc as described by mellon et al . . separation was achieved with a gradient of trifluoroacetic acid and acetonitrile with trifluoroacetic acid on an column with a flow rate of . the eluent was monitored by diode array detection between and nm . desulfoglucosinolates and the respective intact _PROTEIN_ were identified by comparison of retention time and uv spectra with those of purified standards previously extracted from arabidopsis and quantified at relative to the internal standard . when _PROTEIN_ was included the assay products were separated as described above except that the flow was reduced to and the column diameter was mm . in addition to uv absorption at products were detected by a radioactivity monitor with a flow cell and ap scintillation fluid in a ratio of to column eluent . all data reported are means of at least three independent measurements . preparation and transformation of protoplasts from arabidopsis plants
