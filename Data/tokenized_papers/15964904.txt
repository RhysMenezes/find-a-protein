tonsoku _PROTEIN_ from arabidopsis thaliana which plays an important role in the _PROTEIN_ of meristem organization contains an lgn repeat motif similar to that found in animal proteins involved in asymmetric cell division . one protein that interacts with the lgn motif of _PROTEIN_ in a yeast two hybrid screen _PROTEIN_ associating protein _PROTEIN_ contains a fold repeat of a unique amino acid sequence . the repeat sequence with a glutamic acid phenylalanine glutamic acid _PROTEIN_ conserved core sequence is enriched with acidic amino acids . _PROTEIN_ also contains an n terminal putative signal peptide and it interacts with the lgn motif of _PROTEIN_ through a c terminal region separated from the _PROTEIN_ repeats by a putative _LOCATION_ spanning region . the recombinant protein consisting of _PROTEIN_ repeats was rich in helical structure and possessed binding activity . unlike _LOCATION_ localization of _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ fused with green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in tobacco by cells was localized in small cytoplasmic vesicles during interphase . however cellular localization of both _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ changed dynamically during mitosis . in particular both _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were concentrated in limited areas that are close to the ends of spindle microtubules ahead of separating chromatids . these results are discussed in _METHOD_ of the possible involvement of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in mitosis .
yeast two hybrid screening was used to identify proteins able to interact with the lgn repeats of _PROTEIN_ . the coding region of _PROTEIN_ corresponding to exons which covers three of four lgn repeats was fused with the coding sequence of lexa and used as a bait . the _METHOD_ without _PROTEIN_ cdna served as a negative control . the yeast strain with lacz and reporter genes under the control of promoter containing the lexa binding sequence was used as a host in our screening . the strain was transformed with then further transformed with the arabidopsis cdna library in the vector in which the coding sequence of cdna was fused to the activation domain of herpes simplex virus protein . approximately million transformants were plated on selection plates containing mm aminotriazole and colonies that grew on selection plates were assayed for galactosidase activity . plasmid dna isolated from a positive clone was used to retransform yeast host cells with _METHOD_ or clones that allowed the growth of cells with but not cells with _METHOD_ on selective plates were chosen for further analysis . among the positive clones > clones contained partial cdna derived from the same mrna with varying lengths . the growth of yeast cells harboring one of these positive clones on selective plates is shown in fig . . the enabled yeast host cells to grow on selective plates only with . the transcript covered by and other clones was derived from the predicted arabidopsis gene _GENE_ which was named _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . other cdna clones contained the terminal portion of _PROTEIN_ mrna in common with varying lengths toward the terminus . the public database contained one full length cdna for _PROTEIN_ which was bp in length and coded for a protein with amino acid residues . comparison of the sequences of the full length cdna and genomic dna indicated that the _PROTEIN_ gene was split into exons interrupted by introns . another predicted cdna for one splicing variant of _PROTEIN_ mrna was also present in the database . in this cdna selection of an alternative splice acceptor site of the intron resulted in a nucleotide extension of the exon compared with . the occurrence of alternative splicing of the _PROTEIN_ transcript was verified by sequencing the reverse transcription pcr products with the longer transcripts being more abundant . the amino acid sequence of _PROTEIN_ predicted from cdna begins with the n terminal hydrophobic signal peptide like sequence followed by times repeats of similar sequences occupying the n terminal half of the molecule . most of the repeated sequences are amino acids long except for the c terminal unit consisting of amino acids . each repeat sequence is encoded by two exons and the intron insertion sites are highly conserved . the repeat sequence is enriched with acidic amino acids and the predicted pi of _PROTEIN_ is . the repeat sequence was named _PROTEIN_ repeat after the highly conserved core amino acid sequence of the repeats . several computer _METHOD_ indicated that the repeat sequence in particular the sequence around the _PROTEIN_ core motif exists as an helix . the consensus sequence of _PROTEIN_ repeats contained hydrophobic amino acids with intervals of amino acids which suggests the participation of _PROTEIN_ repeats in the formation of a coiled coil structure . a database search for a homolog of _PROTEIN_ indicated the presence of another arabidopsis gene coding for a protein highly similar to _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ like protein encoded by this gene consisted of amino acids and contained _PROTEIN_ repeats similar to _PROTEIN_ . the intron exon organization of the _PROTEIN_ like gene was also similar to that of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ like were located on a large duplicated segment between chromosomes and . in addition to these two arabidopsis proteins only one _PROTEIN_ sequence tag sequence of chinese cabbage coded for a protein containing at least three _PROTEIN_ repeats . these results suggest that the _PROTEIN_ repeat is conserved at least in brassicaceae and can be considered to be a novel repeat sequence unique to plants . the _PROTEIN_ gene is _PROTEIN_ predominantly in the _METHOD_ . _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ like genes in various organs of arabidopsis was examined and compared with that of _PROTEIN_ by quantitative real time rt pcr . the _PROTEIN_ levels of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ like and _PROTEIN_ were normalized to the level of actin mrna . the _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ gene was most abundant in the flower and slightly less abundant in the shoot apex . similar to _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was preferentially _PROTEIN_ in the flower and shoot apex . the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ like was different from that of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and was greatest in the roots . these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are _PROTEIN_ under similar developmental control _METHOD_ while _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ like is differentially controlled . to confirm the interaction between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in vitro the lgn repeat region of _PROTEIN_ encoded by exons used in two hybrid screening was _PROTEIN_ in escerichia coli as a fusion with the tag at the n terminus and with the his tag at the c terminus _PROTEIN_ . the c terminal region of _PROTEIN_ encoded by exon was similarly _PROTEIN_ in e. coli as a fusion with the his tag at the c terminus _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ proteins partially purified from cell lysates with an ni _PROTEIN_ resin column were separated by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ blotted onto the _LOCATION_ and detected with anti his tag antibody . the _PROTEIN_ appeared as a single band of kda as expected from the sequence . in contrast the preparation of _PROTEIN_ showed a major band of kda which is similar to the size expected from the sequence and an additional band of kda which could be a degradation product . in the co precipitation assay _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were mixed and incubated followed by immunoprecipitation of _PROTEIN_ with anti tag antibody conjugated to agarose . the precipitated fraction contained in addition to _PROTEIN_ the kda band of _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ was not detected in the immunoprecipitated fraction when either _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ was omitted from the reaction mixture . these results indicate that the c terminal region of _PROTEIN_ interacts with the lgn repeat region of _PROTEIN_ in vitro . to define further the domains of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ that participate in the interaction a yeast two hybrid assay was performed . first various deletions from the n terminal region of _PROTEIN_ were created and fused with the lexa dna binding domain followed by an examination of their ability to interact with the c terminal region of _PROTEIN_ fused with the transcription activation domain by the growth of yeast cells on selective medium . the _PROTEIN_ of various deletion derivatives of the _PROTEIN_ bd fusion protein was verified by western blotting of the yeast cell lysate with anti lexa antibody . _PROTEIN_ contained four lgn repeats and three of the four lgn repeats are covered in _PROTEIN_ bd . deletion of the region outside of the lgn repeats did not abolish interaction with _PROTEIN_ ad _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . in contrast _PROTEIN_ with partial deletions of the lgn repeats did not bind to _PROTEIN_ . these results indicate that the lgn repeats of the _PROTEIN_ protein are necessary and sufficient to interact with _PROTEIN_ . the c terminal region of _PROTEIN_ was cloned into the _METHOD_ vector to be _PROTEIN_ as a fusion with bd in yeast _PROTEIN_ and the region of _PROTEIN_ used in the yeast two hybrid screening was cloned into the vector to be _PROTEIN_ as a fusion with ad _PROTEIN_ . various deletions from _PROTEIN_ bd were examined for the ability to interact with _PROTEIN_ ad . western blotting of the yeast cell lysate with anti lexa antibody verified _PROTEIN_ of these deletion derivatives of _PROTEIN_ bd fusion protein in yeast cells . in addition to _PROTEIN_ two deletion derivatives _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ interacted with _PROTEIN_ ad . all the other deletion derivatives of _PROTEIN_ bd failed to interact with _PROTEIN_ ad . these results indicate that the c terminal amino acid sequence from to of _PROTEIN_ is necessary and sufficient to interact with the lgn repeats of _PROTEIN_ . the most characteristic feature of _PROTEIN_ is the _PROTEIN_ motif repeated times consecutively . the _PROTEIN_ repeat sequence is highly enriched with charged amino acids and of amino acid residues in the repeat region are acidic and basic amino acids respectively . this high ratio of acidic amino acids in the _PROTEIN_ repeats and the localization of _PROTEIN_ to small cytoplasmic vesicles as described below suggested that the _PROTEIN_ repeats may bind cations in particular . the portion of _PROTEIN_ corresponding to the sequence covered by exons _PROTEIN_ that encompassed all _PROTEIN_ repeats was fused with a tag at its n terminus and a his tag at its c terminus and _PROTEIN_ in e. coli . _PROTEIN_ was purified from the cell lysate with ni _PROTEIN_ resin and anti ag antibody . upon _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and staining with _METHOD_ brilliant blue _PROTEIN_ migrated as a single band with an apparent size of kda which is larger than the molecular _METHOD_ of kda predicted from the sequence . the band of _PROTEIN_ was clearly stained blue by stains all which specifically stains calcium binding protein blue . bovine serum albumin used as a negative control was not stained by stains all . the calcium binding activity of _PROTEIN_ was directly examined by overlay assay . _PROTEIN_ was blotted on the _LOCATION_ and incubated with a solution containing . after washing with ethanol bound to the _LOCATION_ was detected by autoradiography . _PROTEIN_ gave a clear positive signal of . calmodulin blotted on the _LOCATION_ also showed a strong positive signal while bsa did not show significant binding . binding of to _PROTEIN_ was abolished by the addition of mm in the reaction mixture while the addition of mm na and k did not abolish the binding . these results indicate that the _PROTEIN_ repeat is a novel motif that specifically binds calcium . the secondary structure prediction program suggested that a large part of the _PROTEIN_ repeat sequence assumes an helix with a spacer of variable length . the circular dichroism spectrum of purified _PROTEIN_ showed a peak at nm with a shoulder near nm supporting that the _PROTEIN_ repeat region of _PROTEIN_ is rich in helical structure . under the conditions employed the cd spectrum of _PROTEIN_ did not change significantly in the presence or absence of calcium . to examine whether _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ a multimer which was anticipated from the regularly spaced hydrophobic amino acids in the helix of the _PROTEIN_ repeat the n terminally truncated _PROTEIN_ corresponding to exons was _PROTEIN_ in e. coli as a fusion protein with a tag at its n terminus and a his tag at its c terminus _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ purified from the cell lysate was applied to a superose gel filtration column . although the molecular _METHOD_ of _PROTEIN_ estimated from the sequence was kda it migrated on _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ as a band of kda probably due to a high proportion of acidic amino acids . upon column chromatography the _PROTEIN_ band eluted in fractions and . from elution profiles of size marker proteins the molecular _METHOD_ of the eluted protein was estimated to be kda suggesting that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ a hexamer or heptamer . under these conditions calcium did not affect the multimerization of _PROTEIN_ . similar results were obtained from the gel filtration assay using _PROTEIN_ indicating that multimerization was mediated by the _PROTEIN_ repeats . in plant cells the major calcium storage organelles are the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ . since the _PROTEIN_ protein was expected to have a signal peptide and bind calcium the cellular localization of _PROTEIN_ was examined by fusion with _METHOD_ . the full length cdna of _PROTEIN_ was cloned into binary vector to _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ fused with _METHOD_ at its c terminus under the promoter . arabidopsis plant and tobacco cell culture line by was transformed by agrobacterium mediated transformation . transformed arabidopsis plant and tobacco by cells _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were selected and observed under confocal laser scanning microscopy _METHOD_ . in both cells the _METHOD_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ appeared as many spots in the cytoplasm suggesting that _PROTEIN_ is associated with cytoplasmic vesicles possibly in the _LOCATION_ or the _LOCATION_ but is not localized in _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ or the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . the _METHOD_ of _METHOD_ alone was observed in the cytoplasm and _LOCATION_ . since the _PROTEIN_ protein was localized to the _LOCATION_ the association of _PROTEIN_ with cytoplasmic vesicles is not readily consistent with an interaction between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . to investigate this apparent contradiction the cellular localization of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ during cell division cycle was examined in tobacco by cells . cell division of tobacco by cells _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was synchronized by treatment with aphidicolin followed by propyzamide . cells at each stage of the cell cycle were fixed stained with anti tubulin antibody and observed under _PROTEIN_ . in cells arrested in interphase by propyzamide many spots of _METHOD_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were observed in the cytoplasm around the _LOCATION_ envelope along the cytoplasmic strand and near the cell periphery . at this stage microtubules were also observed around the _LOCATION_ envelope and they extended from the _LOCATION_ to the cell cortex . in the prophase cells when the _LOCATION_ envelope disappears and chromatins appear both _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and microtubules were assembled around the periphery of chromatids . when the cell cycle proceeds to the metaphase _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was largely concentrated at external ends of spindle microtubules where spindle poles are supposed to be formed . the other ends of spindle microtubules surrounded chromatins . in the anaphase cells _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ appeared as clear disc like structures ahead of separated chromatids while microtubules appeared between two chromatids where phragmoplast are to be formed . during the telophase _METHOD_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ resumed its spotty appearance around the _LOCATION_ envelope . cell division of tobacco by cells _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was also synchronized with aphidicolin and propyzamide stained with propidium iodide for the cell wall and dna and observed under _PROTEIN_ . in interphase cells _METHOD_ of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ appeared uniformly in the nucleoplasm . however cellular localization of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ also changed dynamically during the cell division cycle . in metaphase cells most of the _METHOD_ of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ appeared as spots and these spots gathered ahead of the separated chromatids in anaphase cells . similar to _METHOD_ _METHOD_ of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was not detected between the separated chromatids . this appearance of _METHOD_ of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was quite different from that of free _METHOD_ in anaphase cells . the spotty appearance of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ dissappered when cells entered telophase . it was noteworthy that both _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ showed dynamic relocalization during the cell cycle and a similar localization ahead of the separation of chromatids during anaphase .
