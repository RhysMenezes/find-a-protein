during leaf senescence plants degrade chlorophyll to colorless linear tetrapyrroles that are stored in the _LOCATION_ of senescing cells . the early steps of chlorophyll breakdown occur in _LOCATION_ . to date five chlorophyll catabolic enzymes nonyellow _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ like pheophytinase pheophorbide a oxygenase _PROTEIN_ and red chlorophyll catabolite reductase have been identified these enzymes catalyze the stepwise degradation of chlorophyll to a _METHOD_ intermediate pfcc which is then exported from the _LOCATION_ . in addition _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mendel s green cotyledon gene encoding a chloroplast protein is required for the initiation of chlorophyll breakdown in _LOCATION_ . senescence induced _PROTEIN_ binds to light harvesting complex ii but its exact role remains elusive . here we show that all five cces also specifically interact with lhcii . in addition _PROTEIN_ and cces interact directly or indirectly with each other at lhcii and _PROTEIN_ is essential for recruiting cces in senescing chloroplasts . _PROTEIN_ which had been attributed to the inner envelope is found to localize in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . these data indicate a predominant role for the _PROTEIN_ cce lhcii protein interaction in the breakdown of lhcii located chlorophyll likely to allow metabolic channeling of phototoxic chlorophyll breakdown intermediates upstream of nontoxic pfcc .
during leaf senescence _PROTEIN_ and five cces _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ have been identified as essential components of chlorophyll degradation . for this study we produced arabidopsis transgenic lines that constitutively _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or one of the five cces as fusion proteins with green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ tandem affinity purification or glutathione s transferase _PROTEIN_ tags . transgenic lines with the highest levels of transgene _PROTEIN_ were selected and correct sizes of fusion proteins were verified by immunoblot analysis using antibodies against _METHOD_ _METHOD_ myc and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . all the _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ and cces were mostly detected in _LOCATION_ enriched fractions and barely in soluble fractions of total protein extracts . to examine the effects of constitutive _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ tagged cces on chlorophyll degradation during leaf senescence we used week old plants to dark induce senescence in either whole plants or detached leaves . before dark incubation chlorophyll levels and chlorophyll a/b ratios of these transgenic plants were almost indistinguishable from the wild type plants . however accelerated leaf yellowing and reduced levels of chlorophyll were observed at ddi in both whole plants and detached leaves compared with the wild type plants . in addition because of an assumingly enhanced chlorophyll b reductase activity _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ plants exhibited higher chlorophyll a/b ratios . these plants exhibited a similar phenotype under natural senescence conditions . furthermore using the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ line we analyzed mrna levels of _PROTEIN_ and the other chlorophyll catabolic genes in green and senescence induced leaves . after senescence induction _PROTEIN_ rccr _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ but not _PROTEIN_ were significantly higher _PROTEIN_ in the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ overexpressing plants than in the wild type plants . these results indicate that constitutive _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ tagged cces is not sufficient to activate chlorophyll degradation during vegetative growth but significantly accelerates chlorophyll degradation during leaf senescence likely through transcriptional coactivation of other genes of the pathway . chlorophyll levels of week old transgenic arabidopsis plants _PROTEIN_ tagged versions of _PROTEIN_ and cces previously we showed that _PROTEIN_ interacts with lhcii in vitro and in vivo . using _METHOD_ conjugated beads for in vivo pull down assays with _LOCATION_ enriched fractions of nonsenescent or senescence induced _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ plants we found that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ which is constitutively present in this line interacts with lhcii _PROTEIN_ of the senescence conditions . we extended this analysis by testing whether cces also interact with lhcii and/or other photosystem proteins . for this we performed in vivo pull down assays with nonsenescent _METHOD_ or _PROTEIN_ tagged transgenic plants using _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ conjugated beads respectively followed by immunoblot analysis with antibodies against three photosystem proteins _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . like _PROTEIN_ all five cce proteins were coimmunoprecipitated with _PROTEIN_ but not with _PROTEIN_ or indicating that not only _PROTEIN_ but also chloroplast located cces bind to lhcii at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . the interaction of _PROTEIN_ and the five cces with lhcii indicated the formation of a large chlorophyll catabolic complex for chlorophyll breakdown during leaf senescence . to investigate this possibility _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ plants were employed for in vivo pull down assays . to this end intact plants were senescence induced by ddi and the _LOCATION_ enriched fractions were treated with _METHOD_ conjugated beads . as revealed using _PROTEIN_ rccr _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ we found that all tested endogenous proteins _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were coimmunoprecipitated with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . although the results shown in figure supported the possibility of multiprotein complex formation they left the question open whether the observed coimmunoprecipitation between _PROTEIN_ and cces solely occurred through their interaction with lhcii or through sole bilateral interaction between pulled _PROTEIN_ and the other proteins or whether more complex patterns of direct interaction might exist among _PROTEIN_ and cces . for example in vitro interactions of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ rccr have been reported . to address this we first examined pairwise interactions among them by measuring galactosidase activity in yeast two hybrid assays . we found significant interactions between _PROTEIN_ and each of the five cces and between rccr and the other four cces . among the latter cces _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ only interactions of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were significant . to eliminate possible interference of the n terminal chloroplast targeting sequences of the proteins investigated in the yeast two hybrid assays we further examined pairwise interactions by in vitro pull down assays using the _LOCATION_ enriched fractions of _METHOD_ tagged transgenic lines . the results were consistent with the yeast two hybrid interactions . together these data strongly suggested that _PROTEIN_ may act as key players to recruit other cces into a possible multiprotein complex for rapid and safe chlorophyll breakdown during leaf senescence . next we used bifc as an alternative method to analyze pairwise interactions among _PROTEIN_ and cces in vivo . different combinations of _PROTEIN_ cce proteins that were fused to either the n or c terminal half of yellow _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ _METHOD_ were cotransformed into mesophyll protoplasts isolated from ddi green or ddi senescent leaf tissues . as a positive control for protein protein interaction that is unrelated to chlorophyll breakdown we used the two halves of _METHOD_ fused to either phosphoribulokinase _PROTEIN_ or chloroplast protein _PROTEIN_ two proteins that have been shown to form a complex in chloroplasts . most positive interactions among _PROTEIN_ and cces described above including _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ also gave positive bifc _METHOD_ signals . however we were unable to verify the in vitro interaction of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ notably combinations that resulted in rather weak interaction in yeast two hybrid assays . surprisingly _METHOD_ _METHOD_ signals were only obtained in protoplasts isolated from senescent leaves but not in nonsenescent protoplasts . based on yeast two hybrid and in vitro pull down analysis we suggested that _PROTEIN_ may act as a key player for protein interaction . in order to address this possibility we analyzed in vivo interaction between _PROTEIN_ and rccr in the arabidopsis sgr mutant _PROTEIN_ by bifc . in contrast with the wild type _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was absent in senescent protoplasts of _PROTEIN_ . functionality of the _PROTEIN_ protoplasts was confirmed by positive _METHOD_ _METHOD_ when using the _PROTEIN_ control . these results indicated that presence of _PROTEIN_ in senescing chloroplasts is a prerequisite for cce protein interaction . taking all the results together we propose that _PROTEIN_ and cces interact directly and indirectly with each other to possibly form a large _PROTEIN_ cce lhcii multiprotein complex at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ during leaf senescence . based on their primary structures all cces except _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are soluble proteins . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ have been shown to localize at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ in rice . by contrast _PROTEIN_ activity was attributed to the chloroplast envelope in barley and proteome analyses also favored envelope localization for _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis . however this proposed envelope localization of _PROTEIN_ conflicted with its proposed interaction with lhcii _PROTEIN_ and other cces at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ as described here . therefore we readdressed the subchloroplast localization of _PROTEIN_ in mesophyll protoplasts by transiently _PROTEIN_ a _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein . as a positive control for inner envelope localization we used a _METHOD_ tagged translocon at the inner chloroplast envelope _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ a component of the chloroplast protein import machinery . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ signals entirely overlapped with chlorophyll _METHOD_ whereas _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ specifically labeled the chloroplast envelope . in addition using the wild type plants we separated chloroplast _LOCATION_ by suc density gradient centrifugation and investigated the distribution of _PROTEIN_ along with chloroplast _LOCATION_ marker proteins by immunoblot analysis of individual density gradient fractions . _PROTEIN_ clearly comigrated with chlorophyll a/b binding proteins but not with an envelope or a plastoglobule _PROTEIN_ marker . together these data indicate a _LOCATION_ rather than an envelope localization of _PROTEIN_ which is in agreement with the finding presented here that _PROTEIN_ is a component of a possible chlorophyll degrading protein complex at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ .
