the disulfide relay system of the mitochondrial intermembrane space has been extensively characterized in saccharomyces cerevisiae . it contains two essential components _PROTEIN_ and _LOCATION_ . the genome of arabidopsis thaliana contains a single gene for each of these components . although insertional inactivation of _LOCATION_ leads to a lethal phenotype inactivation of _PROTEIN_ results in no detectable deleterious phenotype . a. thaliana _PROTEIN_ is targeted to and accumulates in mitochondria and _LOCATION_ . inactivation of _PROTEIN_ results in an alteration of several proteins in mitochondria an absence of copper/zinc superoxide dismutase _PROTEIN_ the chaperone for superoxide dismutase that inserts copper into _PROTEIN_ and a _PROTEIN_ in capacity and amount of complex i . in _LOCATION_ the absence of _PROTEIN_ leads to an absence of _PROTEIN_ and a _PROTEIN_ in abnormal inflorescence meristem _PROTEIN_ a oxidation pathway enzyme . inactivation of _PROTEIN_ leads to an alteration of the transcriptome of a. thaliana with genes encoding peroxisomal proteins redox functions and biotic stress significantly changing in abundance . thus the mechanistic operation of the mitochondrial disulfide relay system is different in a. thaliana compared with other _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ has taken on new roles in _LOCATION_ and mitochondria .
to determine the role of _PROTEIN_ and _LOCATION_ in a. thaliana t dna insertion lines that disrupt the genes and thus do not produce functional proteins were screened . in the case of _PROTEIN_ one line with a t dna insert that disrupted the gene was obtained from screening all lines annotated as having insertions in _PROTEIN_ . the absence of the protein was confirmed by western blot analysis against purified mitochondria from col and plants . the lack of _PROTEIN_ had no discernable effect on growth with normal seed set production observed compared with col growth under identical conditions . even though a single insertional mutant could only be obtained for _PROTEIN_ the absence of the protein was confirmed by western blotting and it is the lack of expected phenotype that is reported . furthermore backcrossing and southern blot analysis indicate a single insertion in the line characterized . in contrast despite screening three t dna lines for _LOCATION_ no homozygous t dna inactivated lines for _LOCATION_ could be obtained . in addition to back crossing the t dna lines to remove any other t dna inserts or mutations that may be present analysis of the seed from self fertilized heterozygous plants _LOCATION_ consistently resulted in of the seed being aborted for all lines analyzed . this is consistent with a lethal phenotype due to the absence of a functional gene encoding this protein . the lethality of was not surprising as it is an essential protein in yeast . in yeast it is required for the import and assembly of small intermembrane space proteins specifically the small _METHOD_ that in turn are required for the import of carrier proteins to the inner _LOCATION_ . they also play a role in barrel protein assembly in the outer _LOCATION_ . therefore a similar phenotype would be predicted for plants based on extensive studies in yeast and mammalian _METHOD_ . examination of the sequences for both predicted proteins in a. thaliana revealed that they differed compared with their yeast orthologues . in the case of a. thaliana _PROTEIN_ it was a much smaller protein of amino acids . the mammalian _PROTEIN_ protein is also shorter than the yeast orthologue and the smaller core conserved region of _PROTEIN_ has been shown to be functional in the disulfide relay system . the only noticeable unique feature of the a. thaliana _PROTEIN_ was the presence of a putative peroxisomal _PROTEIN_ targeting signal skl at the c terminus . examination of the a. thaliana _LOCATION_ protein sequence revealed that it differed in its arrangement of cysteine pairs to that of yeast and humans . in all _LOCATION_ sequences analyzed to date two pairs of cysteine motifs are conserved in all _METHOD_ the cxxc and motifs . in _PROTEIN_ to the third cysteine pair yeast and human _LOCATION_ proteins have an n terminal cxxc motif whereas a. thaliana has a c terminal located cxxxxc motif . this cysteine motif shows distinct similarities to the yeast _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and the trypansome _LOCATION_ both of which also have their third cysteine pair at the c terminus . phylogenetic analysis of all _LOCATION_ and _PROTEIN_ protein sequences revealed that the plant proteins formed distinct groups noticeably the trypanosome _LOCATION_ branches closest to the plant group this group being the only group containing the third cysteine pair at the c terminal end of the protein . we fused a. thaliana _PROTEIN_ to _METHOD_ at its n and c termini to determine whether the predicted peroxisomal _PROTEIN_ targeting signal was functional . when _METHOD_ was fused to the n terminus a pattern identical to peroxisomal targeted _METHOD_ was seen _METHOD_ . as _PROTEIN_ has been characterized as an exclusively mitochondrial protein in yeast and mammalian _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _LOCATION_ it was investigated if the peroxisomal targeting ability of a. thaliana _PROTEIN_ was a general feature of plant _PROTEIN_ proteins by testing the targeting of the rice _PROTEIN_ . a similar result was observed in that rice _PROTEIN_ was targeted to _LOCATION_ when _METHOD_ was placed at its n terminus _METHOD_ . when _METHOD_ was fused to the c terminus of both a. thaliana and rice _PROTEIN_ a mitochondrial pattern of florescence was observed . noticeably the _METHOD_ produced _PROTEIN_ like structures which we have previously observed for mitochondrial proteins linked to _METHOD_ . they may represent _METHOD_ that has been targeted to mitochondria but not translocated across the outer _LOCATION_ possibly due to the lack of any pulling force by an intermembrane space protein such as _PROTEIN_ . high background _METHOD_ in the cell _LOCATION_ was always evident with both a. thaliana and rice _PROTEIN_ with _METHOD_ fused to the c terminus despite testing in several cell types including onion a. thaliana leaf and root . this high background _METHOD_ is not observed for a variety of other mitochondrial targeting signals and is unlikely to be a technical limitation of the system . additionally the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ to both mitochondria and _LOCATION_ was confirmed using western blotting on highly purified mitochondrial and peroxisomal fractions using an antibody raised against a. thaliana _PROTEIN_ . this antibody detected a specific protein in both highly purified mitochondria and _LOCATION_ purified by free flow electrophoresis . no _PROTEIN_ protein or subunit of pyruvate dehydrogenease was detected in _LOCATION_ indicating the purity of the peroxisomal fractions thus verifying this novel peroxisomal location for _PROTEIN_ . the absence of significant _LOCATION_ contamination in the mitochondrial fraction was confirmed using two peroxisomal markers _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . both markers show that the mitochondrial fraction was free of any significant _LOCATION_ contamination . as a. thaliana _PROTEIN_ appeared to target _METHOD_ poorly to mitochondria we investigated the import of a. thaliana _PROTEIN_ into isolated mitochondria . a. thaliana _PROTEIN_ was imported into a protease protected location in a _LOCATION_ potential independent manner consistent with a location in the intermembrane space . rupture of the outer _LOCATION_ before adding protease resulted in digestion of imported _PROTEIN_ . import of a. thaliana as a control verified that the _LOCATION_ potential was collapsed as import of was inhibited in the presence of valinomycin and that the inner _LOCATION_ was intact as evidenced by the presence of a characteristic _LOCATION_ protected fragment of upon the addition of protease when the outer _LOCATION_ was ruptured . analysis of human _PROTEIN_ showed that it was only targeted to mitochondria when _METHOD_ was fused to the c terminal end of human _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . fusing _METHOD_ to the n terminal end of human _PROTEIN_ resulted in no targeting of _METHOD_ as evidence by _METHOD_ throughout the cytoplasm _METHOD_ . notably analysis of the targeting ability of a. thaliana _LOCATION_ revealed that it is only targeted to mitochondria . as a. thaliana _PROTEIN_ is not an essential protein in a. thaliana we investigated the abundance of various mitochondrial and peroxisomal proteins to gain insight into the function of _PROTEIN_ . analysis of the abundance of a variety of protein import components in plants revealed that _LOCATION_ and had increased in abundance but many other components were unchanged . examination of a variety of other mitochondrial proteins revealed that although many were essentially unchanged in abundance there were notable exceptions . first there was a lack of _PROTEIN_ the intermembrane space located copper/zinc superoxide dismutase and the chaperone protein associated with _PROTEIN_ which plays a role in inserting copper into the active site of _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ subunit of complex i also _PROTEIN_ in abundance significantly . the reduced amount of _PROTEIN_ on _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ gels was confirmed by bn _PROTEIN_ which indicated that the reduction of the amount of _PROTEIN_ was linked to a reduction in the amount of complex i in mitochondria . the capacity of complex i was measured using deamino nadh with mitochondria that had been subjected to freezing and thawing to allow deamino nadh access to the _PROTEIN_ side of the inner _LOCATION_ in the presence of cccp to ensure unrestricted flow of electrons . the rotenone sensitive deamino nadh dependent oxygen consumption was nmol of of protein in mitochondria from wild type plants compared with nmol of of protein in mitochondria from plants . this indicated that complex capacity was reduced by in mitochondria from plants consistent with the percentage reduction of the _PROTEIN_ protein from complex i . the availability of antibodies to peroxisomal proteins in plants is limited . nevertheless western blot analysis using three antibodies revealed that two proteins were altered in abundance . although levels of _PROTEIN_ were unchanged in abundance _PROTEIN_ was completely absent in _LOCATION_ from plants whereas _PROTEIN_ was reduced in abundance by . to investigate if the changes observed in the amount of mitochondrial proteins were due to changes in the rate of import or stability of imported proteins in vitro import assays were carried out with a number of mitochondrial proteins into mitochondria isolated from wild type and plants . a variety of precursor proteins were used the alternative oxidase alternative nad h dehydrogenase _PROTEIN_ a subunit of complex that has been labeled as _PROTEIN_ along with _PROTEIN_ and . _PROTEIN_ was used to test the uptake of small tim proteins into the intermembrane space . finally we analyzed the import of the phosphate carrier which is imported via the carrier import pathway utilizing the small tim proteins of the intermembrane space . although the uptake of alternative oxidase and _PROTEIN_ was reduced to compared with wild type the import of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ was unaffected with the import of the former slightly higher in mitochondria from plants . import of was reduced by in mitochondria from plants compared with wild type . thus although the abundance of some proteins was reduced this did not result from alternations the rate of import . note that as _PROTEIN_ is a mitochondrially encoded subunit in a. thaliana its rate of import could not be tested . the import of both _PROTEIN_ and pic were unaffected . the latter two proteins would be expected to be affected by a. thaliana mitochondria as _PROTEIN_ is a direct substrate of _PROTEIN_ in yeast and the import of carrier proteins depends on the function of small tim proteins . it has been previously demonstrated in plants that small intermembrane space proteins are involved in the import of carrier proteins . thus the lack of a phenotype for plants and the lack of an effect on protein import via the carrier import pathway suggests that _PROTEIN_ in a. thaliana does not play an essential role in the disulfide relay system for small tim proteins as observed in yeast . the reduction in the amounts of the proteins outlined above can be explained by either a failure to correctly assemble these proteins altered _PROTEIN_ of the genes that encode these proteins or a combination of both . to investigate both of these possibilities the assembly of proteins into mitochondria after import was investigated and alterations in transcript abundance were analyzed . to investigate the assembly of protein after import the assembly of a complex i protein was analyzed . assembly of imported _PROTEIN_ into complex i was investigated using bn _PROTEIN_ to assess the location of newly imported radiolabeled proteins as previously carried out for a number of studies investigating assembly into multisubunit protein complexes in mitochondria . it was evident that incorporation of _PROTEIN_ into complex i especially the supercomplex of complex i and iii was reduced in mitochondria from plants compared with wild type plants . in addition to observing reduced radiolabeling into this higher molecular _METHOD_ complex the intensity of radiolabeling at the lower regions of the gel was also altered . although the intensity of radiolabeling at the lower regions was higher in mitochondria from plants compared with wild type at and min it was substantially _PROTEIN_ at and min . this suggests that it is the assembly of subunits into complex i that is affected in mitochondria from plants compared with wild type plants . furthermore the unassembled imported radiolabeled _PROTEIN_ appeared to be degraded in mitochondria from plants as evidenced by the _PROTEIN_ in the intensity of lower molecular _METHOD_ products with time . to gain further insight into the effects of deleting _PROTEIN_ the transcriptome of was compared with that of wild type plants . transcripts were altered in abundance in the plants and were significantly overrepresented in the go annotation response to stress representing of the changes observed compared with in the genome . furthermore analysis of the predicted location of the proteins of genes whose transcripts changed in abundance revealed that proteins predicted to be located in _LOCATION_ were significantly overrepresented by compared with the observed in the genome . a mapman overview of differentially _PROTEIN_ genes revealed that transcripts involved in responses to biotic stresses were overrepresented including four superoxide dismutase genes . thus overall peroxisomal function seemed to be affected to a greater extent than mitochondrial function at a transcript level . specifically transcripts from genes encoding _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and were _PROTEIN_ in abundance by more than fold with significant _PROTEIN_ also observed for _PROTEIN_ . this correlated with the _PROTEIN_ in protein observed by western blotting .
