plant mitochondria _PROTEIN_ metabolic communication with the _LOCATION_ through a family of carrier proteins . in arabidopsis a subset of putative genes encoding members of this family have been identified based on generalized mitochondrial carrier features . no gene clusters are apparent and few of the predicted protein products have mitochondrial targeting sequences recognized by bioinformatic predictors . only nine genes are currently represented by more than _PROTEIN_ sequence tags at the institute for genomic research . analyses of public microarray experiments reveal differential _PROTEIN_ profiles of the more highly _PROTEIN_ members of this gene family in different plant organs and in response to plant hormone application and environmental stresses . a comparison of this arabidopsis carrier subset to the yeast gene family reveals orthologous groups between the two species . recent surveys of the arabidopsis mitochondrial proteome by two dimensional gel separations have not identified any of these carrier proteins presumably because of their hydrophobicity and basicity . isolating integral _LOCATION_ proteins from arabidopsis mitochondria using one dimensional electrophoresis for protein separation and tandem _METHOD_ _METHOD_ based sequencing of doubly charged peptides we have unequivocally identified specific carrier gene products located in mitochondria . this approach has identified six of the nine carriers represented highly in _PROTEIN_ sequence tag databases adenine nucleotide translocator dicarboxylate/tricarboxylate carrier phosphate carrier uncoupling protein and a carrier gene of unknown function . overall the combined transcript and protein _PROTEIN_ data indicates that only a small subset of the carrier family of genes provide the majority of carrier proteins of arabidopsis mitochondria .
many of the various substrate carriers in the inner _LOCATION_ of yeast and mammalian mitochondria contain up to three copies of a amino acid sequence motif known as the mitochondrial energy transfer signature p x x x . analysis of the complete arabidopsis genome with this mets homology motif reveals a set of genes that encode putative proteins containing at least one copy of this motif . in this set of a total of protein products contained some common attributes of the mitochondrial carrier protein family . these genes encode to amino acid proteins with nine to basic pis and six putative _LOCATION_ spanning domains . each member of this set of genes shared a higher degree of sequence identity with at least one other member of the carrier family than to any other arabidopsis gene based on blast analysis . this subset of carrier genes likely excludes some related members that would be included if the selection criteria were changed in some manner . for example by widening the amino acid residue window a putative peroxisomal carrier would be included . however we consider that this set of carrier genes represents a generalized mitochondrial carrier structure with a low probability of excluding such carriers and a low probability of arbitrary inclusion of non mitochondrial carrier genes . clearly putative carriers that do not contain the mets motif and that are longer than amino acids have not been included in this analysis . for this work the above set of proteins are designated as set a. chromosome number and gene number in table i form the unique identifier of arabidopsis genes the arabidopsis genome initiative gene code . gene in table i has an arabidopsis genome initiative gene code of _GENE_ representing a physical gene locus on chromosome at position . this gene would be physically flanked by and . using this information the genes in set a appear evenly distributed across the five chromosomes of the arabidopsis genome . no physical clusters of two or more genes at one physical locus are evident in set a . the closest carrier gene pairs are found on chromosome and are genes apart . most members of set a are separated by hundreds of genes . this means that there is no evidence of the very recent duplication of genes leading to physical clusters often observed in other arabidopsis large gene families . only two genes are found to be duplicates residing in recent segment duplications between chromosomes and and chromosomes and based on the annotation of chromosome duplication segments . in the latter pair the second gene is not included in set a because it only represents the first exon of a carrier protein encoding a amino acid protein and does not contain a mets . members of the mitochondrial carrier superfamily from arabidopsis annotation of the set a protein sequences reported by the institute for genomic research and munich information centre for protein sequences revealed a series of subfamilies predicted on the basis of sequence similarity to transport adenine nucleotides inorganic phosphate protons/fatty acids carnitine/acylcarnitine and dicarboxylates . one of the dicarboxylate carrier family members currently annotated as an omt has recently been experimentally identified as a dicarboxylate/tricarboxylate carrier of broad substrate specificity . a new annotation of this carrier as dtc has been added to table i . a total of genes of set a were annotated in tigr and mips simply as carriers without any known or putative function . no link between physical chromosome location and annotated function was apparent . to further assess the relationships and the possible function of these proteins an unrooted similarity tree of the set a sequences was constructed using clustalx and phylip . to further extend similarity analysis cross species orthologs and in species paralogs were predicted between the arabidopsis gene family and the yeast carrier protein family using inparanoid . orthologs are defined as genes in different species that originate from a single gene in the last common ancestor of both species whereas paralogs are genes in a single species that originated from a single gene in an ancestral species . the similarity analysis revealed clustering of annotated subfamilies for _PROTEIN_ pic carnitine/acylcarnitine a group of two _PROTEIN_ and a group containing two dcs and a putative _PROTEIN_ . although it is tempting to speculate on the apparent overlap between subgroups and they are annotated as distinct groups for historical reasons based on differences in putative function . a further nine subgroups were apparent for which no function is currently known . a total of eight genes from set a fell outside these distinct groups . the inparanoid analysis revealed orthologous groups between arabidopsis and yeast containing approximately one half the carrier genes in each species family . the three most related arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ were in a single grouping with _PROTEIN_ carriers from yeast . the three arabidopsis pics were grouped with the single yeast pic . five orthologous groups were identified for which no function is known in either yeast or arabidopsis . interestingly three arabidopsis genes currently annotated as a putative _PROTEIN_ a putative dc and an unknown carrier all grouped with the dc from yeast . as noted these three genes also clustered on the similarity tree of arabidopsis sequences . a new annotation of all three genes as putative dc has been added to table i . the gene _GENE_ of unknown function grouped with the yeast succinate/fumarate carrier and is not closely associated with the above set of like proteins on the unrooted tree . the known dtc from arabidopsis does tentatively cluster with the like proteins . this suggests a broad family of putative dicarboxylate carrier proteins in arabidopsis that may differentially function in tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediate transport both into mitochondria and out of mitochondria for the aneropleurotic functions known in plant mitochondria . interestingly known specific transporters for oxaloacetate flavin and tricarboxylates in yeast do not have clear orthologs in arabidopsis . the number of ests representing each of the carrier proteins was calculated using est numbers that compose tentative consensus sequences at the tigr arabidopsis gene index database . numbers obtained from this database will differ over time because of their use of different est libraries as sources and the frequency with which they update their information . numbers of ests in nonredundant sets have been used in a variety of _METHOD_ as crude estimates of transcript abundance and thus they provide a baseline for assessment of which genes in a set predominate in the mrna pool . of the set a predicted products are presently represented by ests and of this set only nine are represented by more than ests . this set of nine now referred to as set b contained two different _PROTEIN_ two _PROTEIN_ a pic a dc the dtc and two carriers of unknown function . from est data alone it could be predicted that this subset of genes represents the majority of the mitochondrial carrier capacity . interestingly one _PROTEIN_ is represented by more than ests more than three times the number of the second most abundant member of set a . assessment of the available data at the stanford microarray database revealed that only of the set a carrier genes were represented on current collections of microarray slides . of this a total of eight were from our set b those with highly abundant transcripts numbers from est data . only eight of the carrier genes significantly changed in abundance during any of the microarray slides available and were consistently present on arrays for data analysis . this set of eight contained seven of the set b carriers along with _GENE_ for which only three ests were found . to assess the _PROTEIN_ pattern of this set of eight a series of experiments based on specific treatments of wild type plants were selected for further analysis . this selection included treatments with plant hormones compared with control plants comparison of different plant organs compared against a reference mix of whole plant mrna and a series of stress treatments compared with controls _PROTEIN_ . the carrier _PROTEIN_ pattern clustered into two broad groups . group contained dtc _PROTEIN_ a carrier of unknown function and the low abundance putative _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ of this group was increased in stress conditions such as application of cadmium or auxin exposure to cold and induction of cell death . aba application on the other hand _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ of this group . _PROTEIN_ was also down regulated to some extent in leaves but no trend was obvious in the other plant organs relative to whole plant mrna . genes in group contained pic and the eight clones representing the abundant _PROTEIN_ . this group was _PROTEIN_ by the stress treatments that induced group increased by aba treatment and somewhat up regulated in flowers siliques and roots compared with whole plant mrna . two clones did not fit well into either grouping dc _GENE_ and _PROTEIN_ _GENE_ . the co _PROTEIN_ of pic and _PROTEIN_ in group is interesting given the closely tied function of these proteins in phosphate transport and _PROTEIN_ transport both functions essential for the synthesis and export of _PROTEIN_ for the mitochondrial _PROTEIN_ . the biochemical link between group members remains more elusive exacerbated by the unknown function of _GENE_ and the unclear role of the low abundance _PROTEIN_ . however co _PROTEIN_ patterns may reflect similarity in promoter regions between carriers that need to be further investigated.citation have already highlighted the value of transcript analysis for the elucidation of yeast carrier functions by correlating _PROTEIN_ profiles with those of other known proteins to predict substrates likely to need transport under different _METHOD_ . this family of carrier proteins are all presumed to be targeted to the mitochondrial inner _LOCATION_ . in yeast this is achieved without a cleavable presequence via a specialized import pathway . cleavable presequences do occur in some known mammalian and plant carrier proteins _PROTEIN_ but are clearly absent in others _PROTEIN_ . the exact function of these cleavable regions in targeting is uncertain but a role in import efficiency or sorting between organelles has been proposed . in general the presequences in these cases are to amino acids in length . analysis of the hydrophobicity plots of set a predicted proteins reveals that have extended n terminal regions greater than approximately amino acid before the first transmembrane domain . these extensions could possibly function as targeting presequences . similarity studies reveal _GENE_ is a homolog of the maize adenylate translocator brittle which is targeted to amyloplasts not mitochondria in this monocot . the protein encoded by _GENE_ is a homolog of the known rabbit dependent carrier that is a member of the mitochondrial carrier superfamily but resides predominantly in the peroxisomal _LOCATION_ and only at low levels in the mitochondrial _LOCATION_ . targeting prediction program based on neural networks to identify mitochondrial proteins in plants were used to further assess the likely intracellular location of these proteins in cells . neither targetp nor predotar were able to offer complementary predictions of protein targeting for the set of carrier proteins . the divergent import pathway used by mitochondrial carriers and the possibility that n terminal extensions have roles in import distinct from targeting may be the reason for this lack of predictability . further several n terminal extensions on yeast carriers were recently postulated and/or shown to be non cleaved functional additions involved in binding and _LOCATION_ acid metabolism suggesting that not all such n terminal extensions need be evidence of targeting or import functions at all . to clarify which carrier proteins are targeted and accumulate in plant mitochondria and to possibly define an essential complement of carriers that might be required for mitochondrial operation in plants we used a proteomic approach to determine which gene products are detectable in purified arabidopsis mitochondria . previous attempts to define the mitochondrial proteome in arabidopsis by ourselves and others failed to identify any members of the carrier protein family . this was most likely attributable to the hydrophobicity of these carriers which makes them intractable for isoelectric focusing /sds _PROTEIN_ based separation . here we used a protocol developed for microsomes that used a ph wash to strip peripheral proteins from the _LOCATION_ leaving a subset of integral _LOCATION_ proteins . a complementary approach using chloroform methanol solubility for selective purification of integral _LOCATION_ proteins was recently published by citation . we decided to compare these two methods for the selective solubilization of plant mitochondrial carrier proteins . arabidopsis cell culture mitochondria were purified by two percoll gradients as outlined by citation . a _LOCATION_ fraction was isolated by repeated freeze thawing and centrifugation . integral _LOCATION_ proteins were initially separated from the bulk peripheral _LOCATION_ protein by treatment . comparison of whole mitochondria soluble _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ and integral _LOCATION_ proteins by one dimensional _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ revealed that a series of to kd protein bands were selectively retained . _LOCATION_ fractions were also treated with chloroform methanol ratios of and . insoluble proteins were removed by centrifugation and soluble proteins dried from the organic solvents by a stream of and then solubilized with _PROTEIN_ based sample buffer . the majority of proteins were found in the insoluble fractions . there was little difference between the different ratios of organic solvents used . figure shows the protein pattern from the ratio of chloroform methanol . there is notably little retention of the to kd proteins but some selective solubilization of two proteins at and kd . the to kd proteins bands present in the stripped _LOCATION_ fraction were excised in approximately kd steps from the one dimensional _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and labeled as bands to respectively . putative carriers greater than kd were consequently excluded from this analysis . we expected each of these protein bands to contain a variety of mitochondrial proteins . our previous experience with peptide _METHOD_ fingerprinting _METHOD_ in arabidopsis indicated that such data would be difficult to decipher . we chose an alternative _METHOD_ based approach to identify individual tryptic peptides from each protein band and matched these data back to the arabidopsis databases to develop a picture of the proteins present in each band . spectra of trypsinated samples from each band were generated by electrospray ionization tof and a list of doubly charged peptide peaks selected from each tof spectra . _METHOD_ data was then obtained from these peptides by collision induced dissociation of selected peptides using electrospray ionization q tof . a total of peptides were characterized in this manner and used in searches of the arabidopsis predicted proteome using blast with the de novo sequencing data from _METHOD_ spectra at ncbi and direct searches using _METHOD_ spectra at mascot . identification of carrier proteins from _METHOD_ data a total of nine peptides from spot could be matched to two related _PROTEIN_ gene products of these five were specific to _GENE_ one was specific to _GENE_ and two peptides were found in both sequences . this provided clear evidence that both of these gene products were present in mitochondria . seven unique peptides matched to a pic gene product four to the dtc carrier and five to a _PROTEIN_ . a total of five unique peptides that matched a putative carrier protein were identified in spot and at to kd . the and kd proteins solubilized by chloroform methanol in figure were also sequenced and found not to encode any carrier proteins . comparison of apparent molecular _METHOD_ and the predicted molecular _METHOD_ from the matched gene products revealed that _PROTEIN_ dtc and _GENE_ were all within to kd of predicted size of the precursor protein suggesting these proteins contain no or a very small cleaved targeting presequences . only the _PROTEIN_ and dtc contain several amino acids before the first transmembrane domain . interestingly _GENE_ contains amino acids at the n terminus but its apparent molecular _METHOD_ clearly indicates that this is unlikely to have been cleaved on import . in contrast both the _PROTEIN_ and the pic proteins found were to kd smaller than predicted . both of these members of the carrier family have been reported to contain extended n terminal presequences in other plant and mammalian species . most of the carrier proteins identified had positive grand average of hydropathicity _PROTEIN_ scores indicating their hydrophobicity . very few proteins with positive _PROTEIN_ scores were identified in our previous study of the arabidopsis mitochondrial proteome . this set of six identified carrier proteins located in the mitochondrial _LOCATION_ set c were all members of set b derived from representation in est databases and of course all members of set a derived from genome sequencing information . during the sequencing of these carrier proteins a variety of other noncarrier mitochondrial proteins were identified these included prohibitins voltage dependent anion carriers _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ nadh uq oxidoreductase translocase of the outer _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ malate dehydrogenase _PROTEIN_ synthase subunit and fad _PROTEIN_ synthase subunit . these _PROTEIN_ known _LOCATION_ hydrophobic components further confirm the _PROTEIN_ extraction as a valuable purification step and also provide direct evidence of the purity of the mitochondrial _LOCATION_ fractions used for the carrier analysis . hydrophobic proteins are rarely identified in proteomic analysis . this is potentially attributable to a number of _PROTEIN_ including their insolubility in ief experiments and the difficulty of extracting hydrophobic peptides from gel _PROTEIN_ and ionizing them by electrospray or laser desorption . taking the carrier proteins as a model set of proteins with a very similar six transmembrane domain structure we investigated whether we could relate the positional information of peptide matching to the location and relative hydrophobicities of the transmembrane segments in set c proteins . these identifications were made from one dimensional _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and therefore we could isolate the effect of gel _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ ionization from ief related protocols . figure shows that peptide hits across the six transmembrane structures of the carrier proteins were not entirely random . there were no hits between amino acid positions and which correspond to the segments surrounding transmembrane regions and . we used a new hydrophobicity indicator based on an experimentally determined whole residue hydropathy scale including a constraint for the peptide backbone to score the hydrophobicity of the six transmembrane domains of set c proteins across a amino acid window . the greater the score the greater the relative hydrophobicity . where a peptide directly traversed this amino acid window is shown in bold in . region was consistently the most hydrophobic across the set c protein sequences and no peptides were identified that traversed this region . highly hydrophobic domains at position were present in a number of the proteins . two peptides were identified that traversed this domain but these were from dtc and _PROTEIN_ where hydrophobicity of domain was unusually low . the highest hydrophobicity of a transmembrane domain across which a peptide traversed was domain of pic . this degree of hydrophobicity may represent an approximate upper limit for extraction and ionization . low hydrophobicity transmembrane helices in the carrier family of yeast have been proposed to form the transmembrane path in the transport of _PROTEIN_ molecules . the diversity of position and the number of such low hydrophobic transmembrane domains may be valuable in the future for predicting targets for mutagenesis to identify transport function and further classify functional groups within the carrier superfamily . understanding the complexity from genome sequencing and then assessing the dominant active members of gene families for directed study is a vital activity in post genomics research . at first glance the array of mitochondrial carrier genes identified by arabidopsis genome sequencing suggested a very complex set of functions many of which were unknown based on annotation . however further analysis of the _PROTEIN_ of this gene family through est databases microarrays and proteomic approaches coupled with ortholog/paralog studies of similarity indicates that a small subset of these genes predominate . of set b a collection of nine genes that were highlighted by est analysis seven were present in microarray databases and another six were clearly identified by _METHOD_ . the putative carrier _GENE_ of unknown function is an immediate target for future work . we show here that this carrier which has a yeast ortholog also of unknown function is induced by stress conditions suppressed by plant hormones and is present in the inner mitochondrial _LOCATION_ . it should be noted that this investigation was limited to carriers _PROTEIN_ under cell culture conditions and further members may be present in whole plants . the systematic analysis that reduced the diversity of set a to a manageable experimental set of abundant proteins provides the basis for future analysis of knock out and knock down arabidopsis lines .
putative carrier proteins were initially identified by searches for prosite motif at the mips annotated arabidopsis database . unrooted similarity trees were made using clustalx and phylip program . orthologs between yeast and arabidopsis carrier sequences and in paralogs within the sequences from each species were determined using the fully automated inparanoid program that bypasses _LOCATION_ prone multisequence alignment and phylogenetic roots to ortholog assignment by using two way best pair wise matches for clustering . transmembrane domains were identified in carrier proteins using sliding window hydrophobicity analysis with the augmented wimley white scale athttp //blanco.biomol.uci.edu/mpex for consistent identification of the six transmembrane regions _PROTEIN_ was set to . the hydrophobicity values presented in figure were obtained using _PROTEIN_ . estimates of the number of ests representing each carrier gene were made using tc sequence coverage at tigr gene index for arabidopsis release date september . carrier sequences were aligned to a tc using blast . the stanford microarray database was analyzed using the advanced search function to identify clone numbers for the carrier gene family and then selecting and reporting on spot intensities in arabidopsis microarray comparisons based on tissue specific _PROTEIN_ hormone treatments and stress response . intensities were reported as red or green compared with control samples . averaged differences were subjected to _PROTEIN_ processed data was subjected to a self organizing map algorithm followed by complete linkage hierarchical clustering of both genes and experiments using pearson correlation through cluster/treeview . subcellular targeting of predicted protein sequences were performed with targetp as directed by and by predotar as directed on this web site . mitochondria were isolated from dark grown arabidopsis cell suspension cultures according to citationusing percoll density gradient centrifugation . subfractionation of mitochondria was done as follows . mitochondria were resuspended to a final protein concentration of mg in mm _PROTEIN_ koh freeze thawed in liquid times and the suspension was centrifuged for min at yielding a supernatant containing soluble proteins and a pellet containing _LOCATION_ associated and integral _LOCATION_ proteins . the pellet was resuspended in and then centrifuged for min at yielding a supernatant containing _LOCATION_ associated proteins and a pellet containing integral _LOCATION_ proteins . one dimensional _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was performed according to standard protocols using polyacrylamide gels and a tris gly buffer system . q tof _METHOD_ was performed on a q tof _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ using an ionspray source . proteins to be analyzed were cut from the one dimensional _PROTEIN_ gel and digested with trypsin according to citation injected in methanol formic acid selected doubly charged peptides fragmented by collision and analyzed by _METHOD_ . _METHOD_ spectra and collision _METHOD_ data were analyzed with analyst _PROTEIN_ software _METHOD_ . _METHOD_ of collision induced ion fragments were searched against the equivalent theoretical _METHOD_ derived from the ncbi protein database using mascot or used for prediction of amino acid sequence with bioanalyst and subjected to near exact match blastp analysis at http //www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/ .
