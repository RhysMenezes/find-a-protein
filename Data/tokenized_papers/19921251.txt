the de novo biosynthesis of the triphosphopyridine nadp is catalyzed solely by the ubiquitous nad kinase family . the arabidopsis genome contains two genes encoding nad kinases annotated as _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and one gene encoding a nadh kinase _PROTEIN_ the latter isoform preferring nadh as a substrate . here we examined the tissue specific and developmental _PROTEIN_ patterns of the three nadks using transgenic plants stably transformed with nadk promoter _PROTEIN_ reporter gene constructs . we observed distinct spatial and temporal patterns of gus activity among the nadk gus plants . all three nadk gus transgenes were _PROTEIN_ in reproductive tissue whereas _PROTEIN_ gus activity was found _PROTEIN_ in the roots _PROTEIN_ gus in leaves and _PROTEIN_ gus was restricted primarily to leaf vasculature and _PROTEIN_ root primordia . we also examined the subcellular distribution of the three nadk _METHOD_ using nadk green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ fusion proteins _PROTEIN_ transiently in arabidopsis suspension cultured cells . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were found to be localized to the _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ stroma respectively consistent with previous work whereas _PROTEIN_ localized to the peroxisomal _PROTEIN_ via a novel type peroxisomal targeting signal . the specific subcellular and tissue distribution profiles among the three nadk _METHOD_ and their possible non overlapping roles in nadp biosynthesis in plant cells are discussed .
to date there has been only a very limited examination of nadk isoform _PROTEIN_ patterns in arabidopsis tissues during plant development . as _PROTEIN_ is not represented on the affymetrix arabidopsis array _PROTEIN_ details on its _PROTEIN_ profile are not well documented . in order to provide a more detailed picture of tissue and cell type nadk distribution we conducted promoter analysis using nadk gus transgenic plants . these studies revealed distinct developmental and tissue specific _PROTEIN_ patterns among the three nadk _METHOD_ . a total of independent lines were generated for _PROTEIN_ gus lines for _PROTEIN_ gus and lines for _PROTEIN_ gus . gus activity was followed from approximately stage seedlings to _PROTEIN_ in principal growth stage . while quantitative differences in the intensity of gus activity were seen between individual lines the same qualitative patterns were observed . no gus activity was observed in any control nontransformed plants . in germinating seedlings at stage _PROTEIN_ gus activity was detected in the emerging radicle and developing roots whereas _PROTEIN_ gus activity was undetectable in these early stages . _PROTEIN_ gus activity was first observed in stage most notably in the procambium and vasculature of cotyledons . during this period clear differences in the _PROTEIN_ of the nadk gus transgenes corresponding to the three nadk _METHOD_ became evident . while _PROTEIN_ gus activity was very weak in leaves it was much stronger in actively growing root tissue . conversely _PROTEIN_ gus activity was strongest in photosynthetic tissue while limited to vasculature of emerging root primordia . the most striking nadk _PROTEIN_ pattern was seen in the leaf vasculature of _PROTEIN_ gus plants . interestingly _PROTEIN_ gus activity was strong in developing vascular tissue and weakest in more mature veins . in addition strong but localized _PROTEIN_ gus root _PROTEIN_ was observed in the emerging _PROTEIN_ root primordia and root caps up to the quiescent center but not in the columella . in mature plants at stage _PROTEIN_ gus activity was distributed throughout leaf parenchyma and was weak in the rosette and cauline leaves whereas _PROTEIN_ gus activity was much stronger in these tissues particularly in rosette leaves . consistent with the pattern observed in younger leaves _PROTEIN_ gus activity was absent from the primary vasculature in mature leaves but was restricted to in the secondary _PROTEIN_ and quaternary vasculature and leaf marginal hydathode cell regions . in flowers weak gus activity was observed in the anthers of _PROTEIN_ gus plants at floral growth stages and whereas _PROTEIN_ gus plants showed much stronger activity in both anthers and carpels at growth stages and . in contrast _PROTEIN_ gus activity was evident just below the stigma at growth stage the carpel vasculature at growth stages and pollen and ovaries at floral stage . in stage flowers weak but localized _PROTEIN_ gus activity was observed within ovaries whereas _PROTEIN_ gus activity in this tissue was more diffuse . in contrast _PROTEIN_ gus activity in stage flowers was strong in the stigma pollen carpel vasculature and was also observed in the funiculus of the ovary . examination of gus activity in stage siliques revealed additional differences among nadk isoform _PROTEIN_ patterns although _PROTEIN_ gus and _PROTEIN_ gus plants displayed some overlap in the distribution of gus activity in developing seeds . interestingly _PROTEIN_ gus activity was absent from seeds and was restricted to the funiculus and central vasculature . all nadk gus activity was below detection limits in mature seeds . in summary _PROTEIN_ exhibits strongest _PROTEIN_ in roots _PROTEIN_ in the leaves and _PROTEIN_ in the vasculature while all nadks exhibit some level of _PROTEIN_ in the reproductive tissues . in an effort to shed additional light on the roles that nadks may be playing in plants we investigated their subcellular compartmentalization using nadk reporter fusion proteins transiently _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis suspension cultured cells . toward this end we initially confirmed previous reports on the _LOCATION_ and chloroplast localizations of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ respectively . in addition using differential detergent permeabilization assays we demonstrated that _PROTEIN_ is a chloroplast stromal enzyme and not a _LOCATION_ facing chloroplast associated protein as has been previously reported for this enzyme in pea . the differential detergent permeabilization assays function by selectively permeabilizing either the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ or both the _LOCATION_ and organellar _LOCATION_ by digitonin and triton x respectively . digitonin permeabilization will allow the primary antibodies to enter the _LOCATION_ and bind to exposed protein epitopes in the _LOCATION_ or on the _LOCATION_ facing organelle exteriors e.g. the _LOCATION_ outer envelope . triton x permeabilization will allow primary antibodies to enter the _LOCATION_ as well as to access any organelle s interior compartments to bind protein epitopes e.g. in the _LOCATION_ stroma or peroxisomal _PROTEIN_ . with _PROTEIN_ to _PROTEIN_ this protein has been suggested to be localized to mitochondria based on the mitoprot targeting prediction algorithm and the localization of yeast nadhk . however using immunoblotting on arabidopsis subcellular fractions we previously excluded the possibility that _PROTEIN_ was associated with mitochondria or _LOCATION_ and instead is localized to the _LOCATION_ . indeed evidence in support of this conclusion comes from another study by chai et al . whereby _PROTEIN_ was demonstrated to be a _LOCATION_ enzyme based on the localization of a transiently _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ fusion construct consisting of _METHOD_ fused to the c terminus of _PROTEIN_ . it is also notable however that the c terminal sequence of _PROTEIN_ consists of the tripeptide _PROTEIN_ which is similar to a consensus sequence for a type peroxisomal targeting signal _PROTEIN_ i.e. small basic large and hydrophobic residues and thus this sequence when in the context of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein employed by chai et al . may have been sterically masked by the appended _METHOD_ moiety . to address this possibility and determine whether _PROTEIN_ is actually localized to _LOCATION_ and does so via a _PROTEIN_ we initially examined arabidopsis cells transiently _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ with _METHOD_ fused to either its n or c terminus . as shown in fig . h when _METHOD_ was appended to the n terminus of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ thereby leaving exposed the protein s putative c terminal _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ fusion protein specifically co localized with the endogenous peroxisomal marker protein catalase . in contrast when _METHOD_ was appended to the c terminus of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and thereby masked its putative _PROTEIN_ the fusion protein was similar to that reported by chai et al . localized exclusively throughout the _LOCATION_ and did not co localize with endogenous peroxisomal catalase . using differential detergent permeabilization assays similar to those described above for _PROTEIN_ we also demonstrated that _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ is actually imported into the peroxisomal _PROTEIN_ consistent with the notion that the protein possesses a _PROTEIN_ destined _PROTEIN_ motif . specifically we showed that whereas the _METHOD_ attributable to the _METHOD_ moiety in _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was observed in both digitonin and triton x permeabilized _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ transformed cells the _METHOD_ attributable to the immunostaining of _METHOD_ in _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was only observed when cells were permeabilized with triton x . likewise endogenous _PROTEIN_ catalase was not immunodetectable in digitonin permeabilized _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transformed cells whereas endogenous _LOCATION_ tubulin was immunodetectable in cells permeabilized with triton x or digitonin as expected . overall these results indicate that the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was imported into the peroxisomal _PROTEIN_ and not simply bound to the _LOCATION_ face of the peroxisomal boundary _LOCATION_ given that triton x permeabilizes all cellular _LOCATION_ whereas digitonin exclusively permeabilizes the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . although the c terminal tripeptide _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ matches the consensus sequence for a _PROTEIN_ i.e. small basic large and hydrophobic residues this sequence has not been tested experimentally to function as a _PROTEIN_ in plant cells . we therefore generated a mutant version of the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion construct lacking the _PROTEIN_ sequence _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ to investigate whether this sequence was necessary for the targeting of _PROTEIN_ to _LOCATION_ . as shown in fig . c _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was localized to the _LOCATION_ and did not co localize with endogenous catalase in transiently transformed arabidopsis cells . in contrast when the _PROTEIN_ tripeptide alone was fused to the c terminus of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ it directed _METHOD_ from the _LOCATION_ to the _LOCATION_ indicating that the _PROTEIN_ sequence is sufficient for peroxisomal targeting . however _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was not as efficiently targeted to _LOCATION_ as the full length _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ since a proportion of the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion protein was also localized to the _LOCATION_ in transiently transformed cells _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . since a number of previous studies have demonstrated that the functionality of a _PROTEIN_ can be affected by the context conveyed by upstream amino acid residues or so called _PROTEIN_ accessory sequences we next tested the effect of residues adjacent to the _PROTEIN_ tripeptide in _PROTEIN_ on peroxisomal targeting . specifically we generated a fusion protein _METHOD_ consisting of the ten c terminal residues from _PROTEIN_ fused to _METHOD_ . as shown in fig . i _METHOD_ hgisqirsry compared to _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was efficiently targeted to the _LOCATION_ indicating that the residues upstream of the _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ function as accessory sequences that enhance the efficiency of peroxisomal targeting .
