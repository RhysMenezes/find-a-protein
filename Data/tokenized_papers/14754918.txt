_LOCATION_ stromules are _LOCATION_ protrusions of the _LOCATION_ envelope that contain soluble stroma . stromules are often found connecting _LOCATION_ within a cell and _METHOD_ recovery after photobleaching experiments have demonstrated that green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ can move between _LOCATION_ via these connections . in this report the ability of endogenous _LOCATION_ proteins to travel through stromules was investigated . the motility of _METHOD_ _LOCATION_ aspartate aminotransferase and the rubisco small subunit was studied in stromules by frap . both fusion proteins assemble into protein complexes that appear to behave similarly to their endogenous counterparts . in addition both enzymes are capable of trafficking between _LOCATION_ via stromules .
to study the movement of _LOCATION_ proteins in stromules two _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ proteins of different sizes were selected for fusion to _METHOD_ proteins the major _LOCATION_ aspartate aminotransferase and the rubisco small subunit . in a. thaliana the _PROTEIN_ gene encodes _PROTEIN_ activity . rubisco ss is coded in the _LOCATION_ by a small gene family in most plants including n. tabacum . transgenic n. tabacum plants were generated using a pgptv binary vector that carries a kanamycin resistance marker for selection in plants . coding regions for fusion proteins were inserted downstream of a double cauliflower mosaic virus promoter and alfalfa mosaic virus translation enhancer . the coding regions were followed by a nopaline synthase untranslated region . constructs were introduced into n. tabacum cv . _METHOD_ nn via transformation of leaf strips . constructs for plant transformation are shown in fig . . the aspartate aminotransferase construct consisted of the a. coding region followed by _METHOD_ . this construct was designated _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . _METHOD_ was fused to the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ to preserve the cleavage site between the _PROTEIN_ transit peptide and mature protein thus ensuring proper _LOCATION_ import and processing . a five amino acid linker peptide was inserted between _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ to promote proper folding and activity of both proteins . the rubisco small subunit construct consisted of the coding region of p. sativum followed by cyan _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ . this construct was designated ss _METHOD_ . the coding region includes a _LOCATION_ transit peptide sequence . as with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ a five amino acid linker peptide was used to join ss and _METHOD_ . a control construct in which _METHOD_ alone was targeted to _LOCATION_ via the transit peptide was also made . this construct was designated tp _METHOD_ . stable transgenic lines that showed both high and low levels of _METHOD_ were regenerated for each construct . none of the plants showed any obvious changes in growth or morphology relative to the wild type when grown on soil or in culture . in all transgenic lines _METHOD_ was detected specifically in chloroplasts and _LOCATION_ . _METHOD_ and confocal _METHOD_ microscopy also revealed _METHOD_ in _LOCATION_ stromules in all tissues and organs known to have high frequencies of stromules namely hypocotyl epidermis cultured suspension cells flower _PROTEIN_ and root epidermis and hair cells . thus _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and ss _METHOD_ are present in stromules of n. tabacum . in most transgenic lines an even _METHOD_ signal was observed in all tissues and organs . the single exception was found in roots of ss _METHOD_ plants . ss _METHOD_ _METHOD_ in roots was extremely low relative to the _METHOD_ signal seen in other parts of the same transgenic plant . this difference in _METHOD_ may be due to regulation of rubisco subunits . before testing the fusion proteins for stromule trafficking it was necessary to assess whether the fusion proteins behaved as their endogenous counterparts and could therefore serve as indicators of native protein activity in stromules . to this end _PROTEIN_ of the two proteins in n. tabacum tissues and organs that are rich in stromules was examined . fusion proteins were also tested for their ability to assemble into the expected higher order molecular complexes . aspartate aminotransferase activity assays were performed on untransformed n. tabacum to determine the distribution of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . in a. thaliana _PROTEIN_ activity resolves into three distinct bands on native _PROTEIN_ . the _LOCATION_ isozyme _PROTEIN_ migrates fastest on these gels with mitochondrial and _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ running significantly slower . a similar pattern was observed in n. tabacum . although it was not always possible to resolve the mitochondrial from the _LOCATION_ bands a band specific to chloroplasts was visible . analysis of extracts from various organs and tissues confirmed that n. tabacum _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ is present in all tissues that carry high numbers of stromules . _PROTEIN_ like all other plant aspartate aminotransferases assembles into homodimers in vivo . monomeric _PROTEIN_ has been demonstrated to be in vitro . to investigate the assembly of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion proteins protein extracts of transgenic plants were assayed for _PROTEIN_ activity and _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . _PROTEIN_ gels stained for _PROTEIN_ activity indicate that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ is able to dimerize with itself and also _METHOD_ heterodimers with the endogenous n. tabacum _PROTEIN_ . extracts from transgenic plants contain two additional _PROTEIN_ activity bands that migrate between the endogenous _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ bands . the presence of two additional activity bands indicates the fusion protein is able to form dimers with itself and also with the endogenous _PROTEIN_ protein to give the functional enzyme . comparison of activity staining in the wild type and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ shows a relative loss of endogenous _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ activity with respect to _LOCATION_ and mitochondrial _PROTEIN_ activity in the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ plants . this is due to the diversion of some of the endogenous _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ into the formation of heterodimers with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusions . _METHOD_ analysis of the activity gels confirmed the presence of _METHOD_ in the bands containing fusion proteins . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ homodimers and heterodimers were found in all organs and tissues . thus a. thaliana _PROTEIN_ with _METHOD_ fused to its _PROTEIN_ can interact with itself and with the n. tabacum _PROTEIN_ to form enzymes that are functional in vitro . high level _PROTEIN_ of rubisco ss is normally limited to chloroplasts in green tissue as expected for a protein involved in photosynthesis . experiments on n. tabacum indicate that both ls and ss accumulate to low levels in flower _PROTEIN_ and seedlings . protein extracts of n. tabacum were separated by _PROTEIN_ and blotted to nitrocellulose . immunodetection with a polyclonal antibody directed against rubisco detected both ls and ss in leaf _PROTEIN_ and hypocotyls . rubisco was undetectable in roots and suspension cells . ss normally _METHOD_ a kda holoenzyme with _LOCATION_ ls . in ss _METHOD_ transgenic plants the ss _METHOD_ fusion assembles into the holoenzyme in leaves and seedlings of transgenic plants . extracts of leaf proteins were separated by _PROTEIN_ preserving the holoenzyme assembly of rubisco . transgenic protein extracts from leaves and seedlings contain a single protein band . ss _METHOD_ transgenic _PROTEIN_ contain a similarly band as well as a significantly faster migrating _METHOD_ band . leaf extracts of tp _METHOD_ plants contain a single protein band . the similar mobility of the tp _METHOD_ band and the band of ss _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ suggests this ss _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ protein is unassembled ss _METHOD_ fusion protein . the _PROTEIN_ that ss _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ extracts contained both assembled ss _METHOD_ and an unassembled ss _METHOD_ protein made it unsuitable for further analysis since the unassembled protein would not accurately represent endogenous rubisco . leaf extracts showed no _METHOD_ protein bands as expected . to identify the proteins contained in the _METHOD_ bands the _METHOD_ bands from leaf extracts of ss _METHOD_ and tp _METHOD_ as well as the gel region in the sample at the same position as the ss _METHOD_ band were cut from the gels and introduced into the lanes of _PROTEIN_ gels . denatured and separated proteins from the gel slices were probed with antibodies for rubisco . samples contained both ls and ss confirming that the gel slices excised from native gels in fig . contained the rubisco holoenzyme and indicating that ss _METHOD_ fusion protein _METHOD_ a complex that migrates identically to the endogenous rubisco holoenzyme . this was confirmed by the presence of ls and ss in the ss _METHOD_ sample . the ss _METHOD_ sample also contained an additional band migrating slightly faster than ls that corresponds to the predicted size of the ss _METHOD_ fusion protein . thus the _METHOD_ in ss _METHOD_ plants is due to ss _METHOD_ fusion protein that is assembled with endogenous ss and ls to form the rubisco holoenzyme . the tp _METHOD_ sample contained no rubisco protein confirming that _METHOD_ by itself does not interact with rubisco ss or ls . the above experiments confirmed that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and ss _METHOD_ assembled into their respective complexes and could accumulate in stromules . it was next determined whether these fusion proteins could also traffic between _LOCATION_ via stromules as had been demonstrated for unfused _METHOD_ . _METHOD_ recovery after photobleaching was used to monitor the movement of the fusion proteins between _LOCATION_ in hypocotyls . frap was conducted on hypocotyls because stromules are numerous in these organs and often connect pairs of _LOCATION_ . in addition both _PROTEIN_ and rubisco are normally _PROTEIN_ in these cells and the fusion proteins had been shown to assemble correctly here . when _LOCATION_ containing ss _METHOD_ or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were bleached of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ gradually recovered at the expense of _METHOD_ in a connected _LOCATION_ . recovery was generally complete within the min observation period . control experiments in which a single _LOCATION_ without stromules was bleached and then monitored over time showed no significant recovery of _METHOD_ confirming that bleaching was due to the irreversible destruction of the _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ fluorophore . likewise unbleached _LOCATION_ that were monitored over time showed no significant loss of _METHOD_ confirming that _METHOD_ is not lost by photobleaching under these experimental conditions . the observation of _METHOD_ recovery for the fusions in hypocotyl epidermal cells demonstrates that ss _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ can traffic between _LOCATION_ via stromules .
