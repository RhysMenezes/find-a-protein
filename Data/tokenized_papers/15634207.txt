transgenic arabidopsis plants were constructed to _PROTEIN_ a range of _METHOD_ fusion proteins under the companion cell specific _PROTEIN_ promoter . these plants were used to monitor the trafficking of these _METHOD_ fusion proteins from the ccs into the sieve elements _PROTEIN_ and their subsequent translocation within and out of the phloem . the results revealed a large size exclusion limit _PROTEIN_ for the plasmodesmata connecting _PROTEIN_ and ccs in the loading phloem . _LOCATION_ anchored _METHOD_ fusions and a _METHOD_ variant targeted to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ remained inside the ccs and were used as zero trafficking controls . in contrast free _METHOD_ and all soluble _METHOD_ fusions moved from the ccs into the _PROTEIN_ and were subsequently translocated through the phloem . phloem unloading and post phloem transport of these mobile _METHOD_ fusions were studied in root tips where post phloem transport occurred only for the free form of _METHOD_ . all of the other soluble _METHOD_ fusion variants were unloaded and restricted to a narrow zone of cells immediately adjacent to the mature protophloem . it appears that this domain of cells which has a peripheral _PROTEIN_ of about kda allows protein exchange between protophloem _PROTEIN_ and surrounding cells but restricts general access of large proteins into the root tip . the presented data provide additional information on phloem development in arabidopsis in relation to the formation of symplasmic domains .
