the arabidopsis thaliana genome _PROTEIN_ five evolutionarily conserved prohibitin _PROTEIN_ genes that are divided into type i _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and type ii _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ classes based on their phylogenetic relationships with yeast _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ respectively . yeast and animal _PROTEIN_ are reported to have diverse roles in the cell cycle mitochondrial electron transport aging and apoptosis . all transcribed arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ genes are primarily _PROTEIN_ in both shoot and root proliferative tissues where they are present in mitochondrial multimeric complexes . loss of function of the type i _PROTEIN_ had no phenotypic effects while loss of function of the homologous _PROTEIN_ caused mitochondrial swelling _PROTEIN_ meristematic cell production increased cell division time and reduced cell expansion rates leading to severe growth retardation . double knockout _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plants were not viable but transgenic lines overexpressing _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ showed leaf shape aberrations and an increased shoot branching phenotype . genome wide microarray analysis revealed that both knockout and overexpression perturbations of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ provoked an altered abundance of mitochondrial and stress related transcripts . we propose that plant type i _PROTEIN_ take part in protein complexes that are necessary for proficient mitochondrial function or biogenesis thereby supporting cell division and differentiation in apical tissues .
prohibitins are strongly conserved across different taxa . a phylogenetic analysis revealed that the _PROTEIN_ protein family is split into two major groups that we designated type i and type ii with respect to their homology with yeast _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . all analyzed _METHOD_ contain at least one member of both types suggesting that type i and type ii _PROTEIN_ are functionally interdependent . generally type i _PROTEIN_ are smaller than their type ii counterparts in the same species and have more acidic pi values . the arabidopsis genome contains three type i and four type ii _PROTEIN_ genes which probably originate from ancestral duplications as suggested by their conserved intron/exon composition type i and type ii _PROTEIN_ genes have one and four introns respectively . phylogenetically _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are more divergent and are outliers in the set of plant _PROTEIN_ . as no _PROTEIN_ sequence tags have been identified for both genes they are probably pseudogenes or only _PROTEIN_ at very low levels under unidentified specific conditions . no canonical mitochondrial transit peptide or _LOCATION_ localization signals were detected in the _PROTEIN_ protein sequences although the prediction tool suggested a putative n terminal transmembrane helix between the and amino acid . to experimentally assess the function of this n terminal domain in the subcellular targeting of _PROTEIN_ for all seven _PROTEIN_ genes we produced transgenic arabidopsis plants containing the respective _PROTEIN_ promoter the first _PROTEIN_ exon translationally fused to a green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ reporter cassette . the first _PROTEIN_ exons were expected to contain the putative targeting domains . the gus histochemical stainings on the proatphb _METHOD_ gus lines revealed that the _PROTEIN_ promoters drive _PROTEIN_ predominantly in proliferative tissues except for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in which no _PROTEIN_ was visible . at the subcellular level the _METHOD_ signal was observed in a punctate pattern . co localization experiments with the mitotracker mitochondrial marker demonstrated that this pattern matched that of the mitochondria for all five _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ gus fusion proteins . the full length open reading frames of _PROTEIN_ were amplified by pcr translationally fused upstream and downstream of a _METHOD_ coding sequence and stably transformed into tobacco bright yellow suspension cells . the corresponding cdnas for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ could not be cloned . for the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion constructs the _METHOD_ signal was diffused throughout the cytoplasm but for the c terminal _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusions it clearly matched the mitotracker marker . taken together these results indicate that _PROTEIN_ are targeted to the mitochondria by an n terminal peptide . in both yeast and animal mitochondria _PROTEIN_ have previously been demonstrated to form complexes of mda that possibly function as chaperones for components of the respiration chain . to assess whether _PROTEIN_ are also part of a multimeric complex we identified the interacting proteins within such a complex with a tandem affinity purification _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ based approach . arabidopsis cell suspension cultures were stably transformed by agrobacterium tumefaciens mediated co cultivation with a _PROTEIN_ tap cassette . the tap tag consisted of two igg binding domains of the staphylococcus aureus protein a and a calmodulin binding peptide separated by a tobacco etch virus protease cleavage site . based on the presence of the double tag two step affinity purification was performed . in two independent experiments with _PROTEIN_ as bait _PROTEIN_ and the type ii _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were isolated . in addition _PROTEIN_ occurred in the tagged and untagged form indicating that it can directly or indirectly bind itself . the _PROTEIN_ were detected at their predicted molecular _METHOD_ and peptides were found close to the n termini suggesting that as in other _METHOD_ no leader peptide is cleaved during import of _PROTEIN_ into the mitochondria . the other proteins included the mitochondrial isocitrate dehydrogenase _PROTEIN_ a phosphoglycerate kinase a dead box rna helicase and three _PROTEIN_ proteins . from these in vivo interaction experiments we can conclude that all _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ are present within a multimeric complex . to obtain an initial insight into the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ characteristics we surveyed publicly available _PROTEIN_ data accessible through the genevestigator toolbox . the highest _PROTEIN_ transcript levels were found particularly in proliferative tissues such as the shoot apex the root tip young leaves and cell suspensions . tissue specific _PROTEIN_ was further explored by gus histochemical staining on transgenic plants containing the promoter _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ gus fusion constructs in which the first _PROTEIN_ exon intron and part of the second exon were translationally fused to _METHOD_ gus . very similar results were obtained with all _PROTEIN_ promoter constructs with the exception of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ for which no staining was observed . we describe the results for _PROTEIN_ that are representative for all five _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ promoters . sometimes gus staining was observed in vasculature but was most prominent in both shoot and root apical tissues . longitudinal sections through the shoot apex of young seedlings revealed strong staining in the young leaf primordia . in cotyledons hypocotyls and differentiating rosette leaves _PROTEIN_ promoter activity was also detectable in stomatal meristemoid cells guard mother cells and trichomes . in mature leaves gus staining was hardly detectable . in inflorescences the _PROTEIN_ promoter was also primarily active in the apical region young leaves emerging axillary buds and young flowers . within the anthers gus staining was located in the proximity of the sporogenous tissue and disappeared shortly after maturation . in immature seeds globular embryos though not the suspensor cells were significantly stained . in roots the _PROTEIN_ promoter was predominantly active in the meristematic zone . the _PROTEIN_ diminished in the elongation zone and did not exceed background levels in the differentiation zone . in cross sections through the meristematic zone the _PROTEIN_ levels were lower in protophloem cells than in surrounding tissues . no promoter activity was observed in root cap cells . in the elongation zone _PROTEIN_ was highest in epidermal cells particularly in the trichoblasts . the _PROTEIN_ promoter was also highly active in developing adventive and _PROTEIN_ root _METHOD_ . _PROTEIN_ root initiation is induced by auxin mediated cell cycle activation . to assess the auxin responsiveness of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ proatphb _METHOD_ gus seeds were germinated on medium containing the auxin transport inhibitor naphthylphthalamic acid . no _PROTEIN_ root initials were formed and no clear staining was discernible in root pericycle cells h after germination . six hours after transfer to medium containing the auxin naphthaleneacetic acid elevated _PROTEIN_ was observed in pericycle cells at the protoxylem poles indicating that the _PROTEIN_ promoter is already active during the first asymmetrical cell divisions of _PROTEIN_ root initiation . this auxin inducible promoter activity is in line with increased _PROTEIN_ transcript abundance in a microarray analysis in which _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ transcripts accumulated within h of the application of auxin . the abundance of _PROTEIN_ transcript was also monitored by real time reverse transcriptase pcr in a leaf development time series . transcript levels of all _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ genes were highest in proliferating leaf tissue _PROTEIN_ during the expansion phase and reached minimal levels in mature leaf tissue . this observation is consistent with the proatphb histochemical staining patterns in which _PROTEIN_ was highest in the youngest leaves and faded toward leaf maturity . thus _PROTEIN_ genes are primarily _PROTEIN_ in proliferative tissues and dividing cells . a loss of function mutant _PROTEIN_ contained a t dna insertion at the end of exon . rna gel blot analysis showed that in homozygous _PROTEIN_ plants the kb sized _PROTEIN_ transcript levels were strongly reduced but that a transcript of approximately kb accumulated . the _PROTEIN_ plants had obvious developmental phenotypes with severe growth retardation throughout their development . germination of _PROTEIN_ seeds was delayed by days compared with wild type and _PROTEIN_ plants . the _PROTEIN_ plants were severely retarded in growth throughout their development . sections through the shoot apex of day old seedlings showed a significant delay in the development of leaf structures . after weeks of growth the rosette of _PROTEIN_ plants had a leaf area that was more than fold smaller than that of wild type plants and had developed fewer leaves than did the wild type . rosette leaves of _PROTEIN_ plants were often curled and inflorescence growth was _PROTEIN_ . these growth related phenotypes were complemented by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ because introduction of a _PROTEIN_ construct restored their growth rate . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ had a t dna insertion in the second exon of _PROTEIN_ and rna gel blot analysis consolidated the absence of _PROTEIN_ transcript in homozygous plants . the _PROTEIN_ plants had no aberrant phenotypes compared with wild type plants . the lack of a phenotype in _PROTEIN_ is probably due to a functional redundancy with _PROTEIN_ that is _PROTEIN_ at higher levels . accordingly in _PROTEIN_ protein levels of type i _PROTEIN_ had not _PROTEIN_ compared with those of wild type plants on protein gel blots with an antibody that recognizes type i _PROTEIN_ while in _PROTEIN_ a drastic reduction in protein levels was observed . the significant developmentally related defects of _PROTEIN_ plants prompted us to investigate the effects of the _PROTEIN_ mutation on growth rates at the cellular level . therefore we monitored the growth characteristics of the cortex cells in the root apical meristem . these cells are well suited to a kinematic growth analysis because they provide a linear model to study plant cell division and expansion rates . table presents the average root cortex cell growth parameters of _PROTEIN_ and col plants week after germination . the overall rate of root growth in wild type plants was approximately whereas in _PROTEIN_ roots it was less than . despite a reduction in cellular diameter _PROTEIN_ the diminished growth rate was not due to a significant _PROTEIN_ in the length of mature cells but rather to a _PROTEIN_ in production of meristem cells and the rate of cell expansion . the size of the root meristem was reduced from in col to in _PROTEIN_ . furthermore the number of cells in the _PROTEIN_ root meristem was more than two fold lower than that in wild type plants and the average duration of cell division was significantly increased from h to h _PROTEIN_ . as a result the _PROTEIN_ root meristem produced only cells as opposed to cells for the wild type . besides the cell division rate cell expansion was also influenced . root meristem cells spend most of their growth in the division zone and once they leave the actual meristem they expand very rapidly to their mature size in a matter of hours . in a wild type root tip approximately eight cells were in the expansion phase compared with only five in _PROTEIN_ . moreover the rate of cell expansion itself in _PROTEIN_ roots was less than half of that in wild type roots . this loss was largely compensated in _PROTEIN_ roots by allowing the cells to spend twice as long in the expansion phase _PROTEIN_ so in the end the cells could reach a normal mature cell length . in conclusion _PROTEIN_ is required to support proficient cell division and expansion rates in growing plant tissues . n.s. not significant . the root tips of wild type and _PROTEIN_ seedlings were examined by transmission electron microscopy . a striking difference in _PROTEIN_ sections was the presence of large sized mitochondria . to quantify this difference we measured the section plane of mitochondria in multiple sections . a more than two fold increase in the section plane was noticed _PROTEIN_ . qualitatively _PROTEIN_ mitochondria had a rounder egg like morphology together with a smoother surface than those of the more ruffled wild type mitochondrial _LOCATION_ . by crossing _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ t dna insertion lines we attempted to generate _PROTEIN_ plants . however within the progeny no plants homozygous for the two t dna insertions could be found with pcr based genotyping nor homozygous for one insertion and hemizygous for the other . to further address the functional redundancy between the type i _PROTEIN_ genes we tested whether the _PROTEIN_ growth retardation phenotype could be complemented by the introduction of _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ . therefore _PROTEIN_ plants were transformed with a _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ construct respectively . transformants were selected and homozygous lines were produced . in both complementations germination and root elongation rates were restored indicating that type i _PROTEIN_ are exchangeable for their role in supporting meristem activities . taken together these complementation experiments and the inability to retrieve a double mutant indicate that an undefined threshold level of type i _PROTEIN_ is necessary to obtain viable plantlets and to support proficient meristematic activities . _PROTEIN_ appears to be the predominant type i _PROTEIN_ acting in the mitochondria because these threshold levels are jeopardized by loss of function of _PROTEIN_ and not _PROTEIN_ and total type i _PROTEIN_ protein levels are appreciably reduced only in _PROTEIN_ plants . we also transformed _PROTEIN_ plants with driven _PROTEIN_ constructs containing the type ii _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . none of the transformants had root growth or germination speed restored indicative of a distinct functionality of the type ii _PROTEIN_ . transgenic lines overproducing type i _PROTEIN_ were produced by transforming arabidopsis with _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ constructs . independent transformants with single locus transgene insertions were retained for further analysis . increased levels of _PROTEIN_ genes in the selected lines were confirmed by rna and protein blot analyses . ectopic _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ did not lead to aberrant phenotypes early in development and root growth rates were identical to those of wild type plants . however at _PROTEIN_ developmental stages both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ had irregularly shaped leaves and after emergence of the inflorescence increased shoot branching . in _PROTEIN_ plants the irregular rosette shapes were most apparent leading to a reduction in _METHOD_ while shoot branching was most prominent in _PROTEIN_ plants . occasionally inflorescence fasciations were noted . overexpressing lines had a shorter stature than wild type plants . to obtain further insights into the downstream effects provoked by _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ perturbations we used gene _PROTEIN_ data as a molecular phenotype . wild type _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plants were analyzed by genome wide microarrays . transcriptomes of the different transgenic lines were compared at developmental stage . except for the growth retardation of _PROTEIN_ seedlings no phenotypical differences were detectable between wild type and transgenic plants at this stage . three independent samples per genotype of pooled seedlings grown in vitro were harvested rna was prepared and hybridized to full genome affymetrix _PROTEIN_ genechip microarrays . probe sets with a fold change greater than were considered as differentially _PROTEIN_ . the complete inventory of differential probe sets can be found in supplementary table . reproducibility of the _PROTEIN_ microarray hybridizations was assessed by monitoring the _PROTEIN_ of a representative set of genes by real time rt pcr on biological replicate experiments . in the _PROTEIN_ seedlings and probe sets were upregulated and downregulated respectively . a strong effect of the _PROTEIN_ mutation on mitochondrial metabolism as noted earlier by aberrant mitochondrial phenotypes was also reflected at the transcriptional level . of the differentially _PROTEIN_ probe sets were known or predicted to be imported in the mitochondria _PROTEIN_ of which seven were involved in oxidative phosphorylation . other upregulated probe sets included genes associated with transport and glycolysis . several genes involved in cell wall metabolism and disease resistance were downregulated in _PROTEIN_ seedlings . a breakdown into functional categories of the differential probe sets in _PROTEIN_ seedlings can be found in supplementary table . transcriptional changes in _PROTEIN_ plants were minor only one probe set was upregulated and three were downregulated _PROTEIN_ . a high affinity nitrate transporter was detected in the upregulated probe set which was also upregulated in _PROTEIN_ plants . _PROTEIN_ and an _PROTEIN_ protein were downregulated . in _PROTEIN_ seedlings probe sets were upregulated and were downregulated . six genes involved in disease resistance were upregulated and genes predicted or annotated to be imported into the chloroplasts were downregulated . in _PROTEIN_ seedlings probe sets were upregulated and were downregulated . remarkably comparison of the differentially _PROTEIN_ probe sets from all four configurations revealed that out of probe sets up or downregulated in _PROTEIN_ lines had similar _PROTEIN_ characteristics in _PROTEIN_ plants . mate multidrug and toxin extrusion aaa _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ associated with a variety of activities abc _PROTEIN_ binding cassette udp uridine diphosphate . with the genevestigator toolbox the _PROTEIN_ pattern of the _PROTEIN_ specific probe sets was assessed in more than publicly available microarray experiments . most of these genes were significantly upregulated under several abiotic stress conditions _PROTEIN_ salt uv b heat and oxidative stress . in addition a spearman correlation analysis on the microarray data sets from the publicly available atgenexpress time course experiments of cold osmotic salt oxidative and uv b stress _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ indicates that these _PROTEIN_ specific probe sets are co regulated during abiotic stress conditions . remarkably a set of at least five genes had very high mutual correlation coefficients and was thus strongly co _PROTEIN_ _GENE_ _GENE_ _PROTEIN_ _GENE_ _PROTEIN_ _GENE_ _PROTEIN_ and _GENE_ .
