cyclic nucleotide gated channels _PROTEIN_ form non selective cation entry pathways regulated by calmodulin a universal sensor in eukaryotes . although cam binding has been shown to be important for dependent feedback regulation of _PROTEIN_ activity the cam binding properties of these channels have been investigated in a few cases only . we show that _PROTEIN_ from arabidopsis thaliana binds cam in a dependent manner and interacts with all atcam _METHOD_ but not with the cam like proteins _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . cam interaction with the full length channel was demonstrated in planta using bimolecular _METHOD_ complementation . this interaction occurred at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ in accordance with our localization data of green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ fused _PROTEIN_ proteins . the cam binding site was mapped to an isoleucine glutamine motif which has not been characterized in plant _PROTEIN_ so far . our results show that compared with the overlapping binding sites for cyclic nucleotides and cam in _PROTEIN_ studied so far they are sequentially organized in _PROTEIN_ . the presence of two alternative cam binding modes indicates that ligand regulation of plant _PROTEIN_ is more complex than previously expected . since the iq domain is conserved among plant _PROTEIN_ this domain adds to the variability of dependent channel control _METHOD_ underlining the functional diversity within this multigene family .
we used the c terminus of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ to study its interaction with cam _METHOD_ and cmls in pairwise yeast two hybrid interaction assays . this approach allowed the qualitative and quantitative analysis of the interaction resulting in his auxotrophic growth and transactivation of a galactosidase gene . co _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ c as a bait _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and as prey enabled yeast growth in the absence of his demonstrating that all four cam _METHOD_ represent putative interaction partners of _PROTEIN_ . the strength of the interaction was quantified as relative galactosidase activities showing robust interaction for all cam _METHOD_ . these cam _METHOD_ constitute group of the cam/cml family in arabidopsis and share amino acid identity . the two most related cml _METHOD_ are those of group . we therefore chose two members of this group _PROTEIN_ with identity and _PROTEIN_ with identity to _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were previously used for interaction studies with _PROTEIN_ and providing a basis for comparability of the cam selectivity among different _PROTEIN_ . like _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is up regulated upon salinity stress and _PROTEIN_ treatment and _PROTEIN_ knockout mutants are characterized by an enhanced tolerance to salt stress . however no interaction was found for the cam like proteins _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . fig . c terminus of _PROTEIN_ interacts with calmodulins but not calmodulin like proteins . left columns the _PROTEIN_ c terminus _PROTEIN_ fused to the binding domain was used in the yth assay together with cam _METHOD_ or the cam like proteins _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ which were fused to the activation domain . right columns experiments repeated using the bd without _PROTEIN_ c. yeasts were grown in the absence of tryptophan and leucine for selection of co transformed cells and in the absence of histidine tryptophan and leucine to monitor protein interactions . interaction between _PROTEIN_ c and cam _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ was quantified using the galactosidase activity assay . bars represent mean results of two independent measurements with three replicates each . labels as in . the

cam _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ was quantified using the galactosidase activity assay . bars represent mean results of two independent measurements with three replicates each . labels as in . to map the cam interaction domain within _PROTEIN_ we investigated binding capacities of different truncated c terminal fragments . a illustrates the c terminus including the helices and sheets present within the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ and derived peptides used in the yth assays . when the last amino acids were deleted from the c terminus of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ interaction was not observed for _METHOD_ or for cmls . the re addition of amino acids of the channel s c terminus including the region homologous to the previously identified cambd _PROTEIN_ was also not able to restore the interaction with cam _METHOD_ in _PROTEIN_ c . these results show that essential parts for the establishment of the cam contact are likely to be provided by the last amino acids . indeed a peptide representing the last amino acids _PROTEIN_ was able to interact with all four cam _METHOD_ but not with _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ as was the case with the complete c terminus . thus in _PROTEIN_ cam interacts with a region downstream of the _PROTEIN_ behavior different from that of other _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . the lack of interaction with cam was also observed for a peptide including the and helices _PROTEIN_ . in a previous report _PROTEIN_ a tetrapeptidic stretch following the helix was shown to be important for high affinity cam binding of . however in _PROTEIN_ a peptide including the helix and the corresponding residues wrlr did not induce cam binding in _PROTEIN_ . these results confirm that the last amino acids of _PROTEIN_ are sufficient to establish the full cam interaction activity of the entire c terminus . additional cam binding activity within the c terminus does not exist because all fragments excluding the last amino acids were unable to interact . while the cambd overlaps with the _PROTEIN_ in plant _PROTEIN_ studied so far these two ligand interaction domains are sequentially organized in _PROTEIN_ . fig . cam binding domain in _PROTEIN_ maps

verified for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . although the homologous region in _PROTEIN_ is also predicted to form a cam binding site this region corresponding to the helix of the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ did not interact with _METHOD_ . fig . iq domain mediates interaction of _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ . alignment of the c terminal regions from arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ the barley cam

with an anti strep antibody . interestingly an additional helical structure following the _PROTEIN_ is predicted in _PROTEIN_ which is located almost at the very end of the amino acid long channel protein . within this region an iq motif is present within all plant _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . iq domains have been shown to interact with ef hand containing proteins and therefore represent likely targets for cam interaction . indeed a stretch of only amino acids corresponding to the iq domain _PROTEIN_ was able to interact with all arabidopsis cam _METHOD_ . while the yth method was suited to demonstrate interaction with _METHOD_ in vivo and to map the responsible cambd the calcium concentration during the interaction is unknown . the calcium dependence of the interaction was investigated using a cam overlay assay and it was demonstrated that the interaction of _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ c required the presence of . green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ and mcherry fusion proteins were used to monitor the cellular distribution of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ proteins respectively . _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was detected in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ of mesophyll protoplasts and epidermal cells of nicotiana benthamiana _PROTEIN_ a _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein . similarly an n terminal fusion of _METHOD_ resulted in _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ localization of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . in addition to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ localization we frequently observed punctuate structures within cells exhibiting strong _PROTEIN_ . as _METHOD_ from _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion proteins can be observed along

_METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ mcherry in tobacco leaves red _METHOD_ from the latter protein was equally distributed between the _LOCATION_ and the _LOCATION_ and was localized near the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . thus according to their physical vicinity _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ could interact in vivo . to visualize this interaction we used the split venus interaction assay in n. benthamiana _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ was fused either n or c terminally to the n terminal part of the yellow _METHOD_ reporter venus resulting in _PROTEIN_ vn and vn _PROTEIN_ respectively . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were added at the c terminal side of the c terminal part of venus . following pairwise co _PROTEIN_ in tobacco leaves the yellow _METHOD_ was compared for the different combinations . while bright yellow _METHOD_ was reported from epidermal cells upon co _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ vn with vc _PROTEIN_ it was reduced to background levels when the reporter was fused to the n terminus of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . these results demonstrate that _PROTEIN_ can recruit _PROTEIN_ to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . in order to compare the efficiency of interaction we used _PROTEIN_ vn for co _PROTEIN_ with vc _PROTEIN_ vc _PROTEIN_ and vc _PROTEIN_ . as judged from the _METHOD_ intensities obtained in parallel experiments _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were not or only very weakly able to interact with

channel _PROTEIN_ . a bifc signal was induced in the presence of _PROTEIN_ c vn and vc _PROTEIN_ which was weak in the presence of vc _PROTEIN_ and virtually absent in the presence of vc _PROTEIN_ . this _METHOD_ the specificity of the interaction between _PROTEIN_ and cam . interestingly the proteins interacted _PROTEIN_ in the _LOCATION_ rather than in the _LOCATION_ . since _PROTEIN_ was localized in the _LOCATION_ and in the _LOCATION_ the question arose as to why the interaction with _PROTEIN_ c was restricted to the _LOCATION_ . fig . c terminus of _PROTEIN_ interacts with cam in

_METHOD_ . _PROTEIN_ c _METHOD_ accumulated in the _LOCATION_ rather than in the _LOCATION_ of mesophyll protoplasts and epidermal cells . a _LOCATION_ localization sequence of the type rrrr is present within the iq domain of the _PROTEIN_ c terminus . we therefore substituted the first three of four arginine residues within the nls and the resulting mutant _PROTEIN_ caaa _METHOD_ was analysed for its localization . indeed the absence of the nls prevented _LOCATION_ accumulation of _PROTEIN_ caaa _METHOD_ as concluded from the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ equilibrating between the _LOCATION_ and the _LOCATION_ . this shows that _PROTEIN_ exhibits a functional nls which is part of the iq domain . however the nls was not required for the targeting of the full length channel since _METHOD_
