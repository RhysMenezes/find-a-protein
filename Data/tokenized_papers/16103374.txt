boron is essential for plants but toxic when present in excess . arabidopsis thaliana _PROTEIN_ is a b exporter for xylem loading and is essential for efficient b translocation from roots to shoots under b limitation . b translocation to shoots was enhanced under b limitation in wt but not in _PROTEIN_ mutant plants . the enhanced translocation was suppressed upon resupply of high levels of b within several hours . unlike a number of transporters for essential mineral nutrients _PROTEIN_ mrna accumulation was not strongly affected by b conditions . however accumulation of a constitutively _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein was elevated under conditions of limited b supply . upon resupply of high levels of b _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was degraded within several hours . these findings demonstrate that posttranscriptional _METHOD_ play a major role in regulation of _PROTEIN_ accumulation . confocal laser scanning microscopy of root tip cells showed that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ is localized to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ under b limitation . shortly after b application the protein was observed in dot like structures in the cytoplasm before degradation . colocalization studies of the fusion protein with an endocytic tracer and an endosomal rab _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ fused to monomeric red _METHOD_ protein suggested that _PROTEIN_ is transferred from the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ via the endosomes to the _LOCATION_ for degradation . these results establish that endocytosis and degradation of _PROTEIN_ are regulated by b availability to avoid accumulation of toxic levels of b in shoots under high b supply while protecting the shoot from b deficiency under b limitation .
_PROTEIN_ mediated xylem loading of b is regulated by b availability at the posttranscriptional level . based on the observations that _PROTEIN_ stimulates xylem loading under b limitation and that the phenotype of _PROTEIN_ can be easily reversed by high levels of b supply it was expected that plants tightly control _PROTEIN_ activity with _PROTEIN_ to external b availability . to investigate the effect of b availability on _PROTEIN_ mediated xylem loading of b plants were grown on enriched b for days before transfer to high b or low b medium for days . then the plants were exposed to enriched b for min and concentrations in shoots were determined . because the _PROTEIN_ cdna carrying the _PROTEIN_ mutation does not function for b export in yeast accumulated in _PROTEIN_ represented b being transported independent of the _PROTEIN_ transporter . under high b supply accumulation was similar between wt and _PROTEIN_ mutant plants suggesting little or no contribution of _PROTEIN_ to b translocation process under high b conditions . under low b supply however a higher accumulation of was observed in shoots of wt plants confirming the contribution of _PROTEIN_ to root to shoot translocation of b. interestingly _PROTEIN_ mediated b translocation _PROTEIN_ within h after resupply of b . these observations showed that _PROTEIN_ mediated xylem loading of b is tightly regulated by external b supply most likely to protect the shoot from b toxicity under conditions of increasing b availability . to address the _METHOD_ of regulation _PROTEIN_ mrna accumulation was monitored by quantitative rt pcr analysis . surprisingly _PROTEIN_ mrna accumulation was not significantly affected by b limitation for or days and resupply of b for or h either in roots or in shoots . therefore it was concluded that posttranscriptional regulation _PROTEIN_ controls _PROTEIN_ dependent xylem loading in response to external b supply . posttranslational regulation of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein in _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgenic plants . to further characterize _PROTEIN_ regulation we generated transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ a _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ translational fusion under the control of which is known to drive strong constitutive _PROTEIN_ in plants with no tissue specificity . the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein was still functional as verified by b export in yeast . we selected two independent transgenic lines accumulating _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ mrna at high levels as determined by quantitative rt pcr analysis . in both lines _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ mrna levels were not affected by b limitation in both roots and shoots . immunoblot analysis of microsomal proteins with a _METHOD_ antibody detected a protein of kda whereas a corresponding kda band was not detected in wt plants indicating that the band represents the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein . in both independent transgenic lines _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion proteins accumulated to high levels in both roots and shoots under b limitation . the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ levels increased within h after transfer from high b to low b medium and _PROTEIN_ within h after retransfer to high b medium in both shoots and roots . these observations demonstrated that _PROTEIN_ protein accumulation was regulated in response to external b supply at the translational or posttranslational level . next we observed _PROTEIN_ dependent green _METHOD_ in root tip cells of the transgenic plants in response to b supply using confocal microscopy . the irregular shape of the root tip cells is a typical b deficiency symptom . under the b limiting condition _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was observed at the cell periphery indicating _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ localization . however within min after transfer to high b medium _PROTEIN_ dependent _METHOD_ was observed in rapidly moving dot like structures in the cells from which the green _METHOD_ gradually disappeared over min . inhibition of protein synthesis by addition of cycloheximide before and during the incubation in high b medium did not interfere with the localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in the dot like structures . when transferred to low b medium _PROTEIN_ dependent _METHOD_ remained at the cell periphery during the whole experimental period of min . to investigate whether b exerts a specific effect on _PROTEIN_ localization or a more general effect on protein trafficking we followed the effect of b supply on localization of _METHOD_ tagged _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ proteins which were also _PROTEIN_ under control of the . in sharp contrast to _PROTEIN_ the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ fusion proteins remained localized at the cell periphery irrespective of external b supply . we therefore concluded that our b treatments did not affect the localization of _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ proteins in general but that _PROTEIN_ was specifically internalized and subsequently degraded in response to b supply . a question remains as to whether the endogenous _PROTEIN_ protein in pericycle will be similarly regulated by the b dependent internalization and degradation as was observed in root tip cells of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgenic plants . although we can not exclude possible artifacts due to strong _PROTEIN_ different nature of cell types or fusion to _METHOD_ the _PROTEIN_ that the patterns of b dependent internalization and degradation of _PROTEIN_ match closely the rapid down regulation of b transport activity without significant change in mrna levels in the wt plants suggests that the posttranslational down regulation also occurs in pericycle cells . similar to the case of the mouse zinc transporters _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ which are regulated not significantly at their mrna levels but by means of endocytosis in dependence of the zinc status it is most likely that posttranslational down regulation is a major step in controlling _PROTEIN_ activity . because b is essential and toxic for plant growth our results support that plants favor posttranslational regulation for the fine tuning and rapid control of b homeostasis by _PROTEIN_ . pathway of endocytosis and degradation of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . in yeast and animal _METHOD_ turnover of most _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ proteins is known to be mediated by endocytosis and subsequent degradation in _LOCATION_ . endocytosis of most _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ proteins starts with internalization mediated by endocytic vesicles . the internalized proteins are transported to early endosomes and are either recycled to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ or sorted further down the endocytic pathway for degradation . the proteins destined for the degradative pathway are sorted into internal vesicles of multivesicular bodies for delivery to the lumen of the hydrolytic _LOCATION_ . in plant cells endocytic recycling of _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ proteins pectins and sterols has been demonstrated by using the fungal metabolite bfa which inhibits exocytosis but allows the first steps of endocytosis to proceed . in addition early studies using electron dense markers such as cationized ferritin and recent studies using lipophilic styryl fm dyes and maker proteins such as rab _PROTEIN_ and snares allowed us to visualize the endocytic route from the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ to the _LOCATION_ in plant cells . confers red _METHOD_ upon insertion into the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and then labels all other _LOCATION_ in the endocytic pathway down to the _LOCATION_ in yeast as well as in plant cells . in a. thaliana cells stained distinct populations of endosomes in which three members of related _PROTEIN_ were localized . in tobacco by cells stained mvbs/prevacuolar compartments known to be a part of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ transport pathway indicating that the routes of endocytosis and biosynthetic _LOCATION_ transport merge at the mvbs/pvcs . however the pathway for endocytic degradation of _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ proteins in plant cells is not yet fully understood . to confirm that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ undergoes endocytosis upon b supply we performed double labeling experiments employing the endocytic tracer . after incubating the roots in high b medium for min with equal time for uptake _PROTEIN_ derived green and derived red _METHOD_ colocalized in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and in the dot like structures indicating that these dot like structures belong to the endocytic pathway . to further investigate the localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in the endocytic pathway we generated transgenic lines coexpressing _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ under the control of the . _PROTEIN_ is a related _PROTEIN_ and has been shown to localize to endosomes in a. thaliana cells . after incubating the roots of the transgenic plants in high b medium for min _PROTEIN_ derived green and _PROTEIN_ derived red _METHOD_ colocalized in the dot like structures indicating that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ localizes to _PROTEIN_ positive endosomes upon b supply . to characterize the pathway of _PROTEIN_ endocytosis and degradation in more detail we tested the effects of inhibitors on b dependent _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ trafficking . concentrations of bfa were shown to cause endosomal aggregation that can be distinguished from endoplasmatic _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ as indicated by ultrastructural analysis and double labeling with _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and endosomal markers in a. thaliana root cells . upon treatment with bfa _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ accumulated in bfa induced patches irrespective of b supply . these patches were intensively stained with as well and inhibition of protein synthesis by addition of cycloheximide before and during the bfa treatment did not interfere with the accumulation of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in the bfa induced compartments . these results suggested a continuous internalization of _PROTEIN_ proteins from the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ into endosomes . it should be noted that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ also appeared as rapidly moving dot like structures in high b medium but not in low b medium in the presence of bfa . under high b supply a part of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was most likely transported from bfa sensitive early endosomes to mvbs which were shown not to be affected by bfa . interestingly in maize root tip cells under b limitation the abundance of pectins in the cell wall increased and the accumulation of pectins in bfa induced compartments was effectively inhibited . these findings suggested that pectin recycling is regulated at the level of internalization in response to b supply . by contrast our studies show that in response to b supply _PROTEIN_ is most likely to be regulated at the level of protein sorting from early endosomes to either _PROTEIN_ endosomal compartments for degradation or to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ for recycling . we then examined the effect of concanamycin a a specific inhibitor of v _PROTEIN_ which was previously shown to inhibit _METHOD_ degradation in the _LOCATION_ of a. thaliana root . _METHOD_ _METHOD_ accumulated in dot like structures and _LOCATION_ after min of incubation in high b medium in the presence of concanamycin a although _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was hardly detectable after min of incubation in high b medium in the absence of concanamycin a . concanamycin a did not significantly affect localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in the cell periphery under low b supply . these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ is transported to and degraded in the _LOCATION_ upon high b supply . in yeast cells lacking major _LOCATION_ proteases the immunolocalization study of the zinc transporter yielded _LOCATION_ staining in response to zinc . similarly we presumed that concanamycin a raised the ph in _LOCATION_ lumens thus preventing _LOCATION_ protease activities . alternatively concanamycin a which has been shown to strongly affect the morphology of the _LOCATION_ apparatus may inhibit transport of _LOCATION_ proteases necessary for _METHOD_ degradation . taken together we conclude that _PROTEIN_ is internalized continuously from the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ into early endosomes for recycling to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ under b limitation although it proceeds to _PROTEIN_ endosomal compartments and finally is degraded in _LOCATION_ upon exposure to high b . b dependent regulation of _PROTEIN_ endocytosis and degradation provides a fast and efficient way to control _PROTEIN_ activity necessary under b deficiency but detrimental under high b supply .
