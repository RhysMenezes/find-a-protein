the methylcytosines play a critical role in epigenetic control often being recognized by proteins containing a methyl cpg binding domain . database screening has identified at least putative methyl cpg binding proteins from arabidopsis we have isolated corresponding cdnas for seven of them . despite variation in size and amino acid sequence all seven proteins exclusively migrate into the _LOCATION_ as revealed by green _METHOD_ protein fusion protein assay suggesting a relationship with chromatin structure . however dna binding assays using bacterially _PROTEIN_ proteins and synthetic oligonucleotides containing in cpgs showed only one to specifically bind designated _PROTEIN_ . further analysis showed that _PROTEIN_ efficiently binds to in cpnpn but not in cpnpg sequences both frequently found in plant dna . the other six proteins showed either nonspecific dna binding or no ability to recognize . rna blot hybridization and immunoblot analysis indicated _PROTEIN_ to be present essentially in all tissues . using green _METHOD_ protein driven by the authentic promoter _PROTEIN_ was found to be actively _PROTEIN_ in pistils and root tips . because in cpg and cpnpn are considered to function in gene _PROTEIN_ and gene silencing respectively the present results suggest that _PROTEIN_ may have distinct functions in regulation and/or self defense of genes in actively proliferating cells .
when we initiated the present study eight arabidopsis genes encoding putative proteins possessing an mbd were found in the plant chromatin database and designated atmbd with serial numbers through . the number of genes however subsequently increased and currently putative genes with mbds are present in the database . in this study however we focused on the initially identified eight genes . the nomenclature was followed after the database except for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ because different sequences were recently assigned to _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . the potential mbds in the different proteins generally have a low level of similarity although some showed more than similarity such as and _PROTEIN_ with and _PROTEIN_ respectively . all the atmbds are characterized by a lack of the transcriptional repressor domain which and _PROTEIN_ of mammals typically possess . to determine whether or not these genes are transcribed in planta a cdna library derived from the whole plant of arabidopsis was screened to identify the corresponding transcripts by pcr using specific primers designed according to the predicted open reading frames . as a result all cdnas except for that of could be isolated . although some of the open reading frame in the database was based on prediction the determined nucleotide sequences of these clones were identical with those predicted indicating correct placement of splicing sites . however two pcr products with different sizes were amplified for _PROTEIN_ . because this amplification was observed in rt pcr it could due to alternative splicing of the _PROTEIN_ gene . because the larger cdna encoded a small protein truncated at the domain for methyl dna binding it was eliminated from further analyses . cellular localization of atmbd proteins was examined with green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ fused constructs . plasmids containing cauliflower mosaic virus promoter atmbd _METHOD_ genes were constructed and biolistically bombarded into onion epidermal cells . _METHOD_ analyses indicated that whereas the control construct containing only _METHOD_ showed signals in cytoplasmic space and in _LOCATION_ all atmbd _METHOD_ constructs demonstrated _METHOD_ exclusively in _LOCATION_ . to determine whether or not atmbd proteins recognize and bind glutathione s transferase _PROTEIN_ atmbd recombinant proteins were _PROTEIN_ in escherichia coli and partially purified in glutathione sepharose columns . each atmbd protein was subjected to binding assay with double stranded synthetic oligonucleotides of bp containing five symmetrical sites . after incubation samples were subjected to electrophoresis in gels for retardation assays . as the control the same probe without methylation was used . results showed _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ to form complexes with the methylated probe whereas the other proteins were unable to bind under the conditions employed . however control experiments showed that only _PROTEIN_ was specific to being unable to bind the unmethylated probe whereas and _PROTEIN_ bound to the probe _PROTEIN_ of the methylation . the possibility of binding to in cpnpg and cpnpn sequences was then examined using synthetic oligomers . the results clearly showed that _PROTEIN_ bound but not whereas and _PROTEIN_ bound both probes . other atmbds did not bind to any of the probes . the specificity of _PROTEIN_ toward and was confirmed by competition where a fold excess of unlabeled methylated competitor effectively interfered with the binding whereas the same amount of unmethylated dna did not . a similar competition assay showed neither nor _PROTEIN_ to specifically target . although the possibility remains that results obtained with recombinant protein samples lacking posttranslational modification may not completely reflect in vivo situation these experiments suggested that among the seven atmbd proteins only _PROTEIN_ is able to recognize and that and _PROTEIN_ might be nonspecific dna binding proteins . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ apparently are unable to directly bind to dna . chromosomal localization of _PROTEIN_ was visually assessed by histochemical staining . when maize cells were subjected to binding assay with the bacterially _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ protein _METHOD_ signals of the secondary antibody against _PROTEIN_ were clearly observed in _LOCATION_ of interphase cells . this is particularly distinct in metaphase showing clear signals along individual chromosomes . for more detailed observation extended dna fibers from arabidopsis cells were prepared and visualized with the _METHOD_ dye yoyo . the same preparation was then subjected to binding to _PROTEIN_ and visualized by rhodamine _METHOD_ of the secondary antibodies used for chromosome staining . signals were found to track along the dna fibers . this pattern resembled that of indirect immunostaining of extended dna fibers with anti antibodies . thus these experiments indicated that _PROTEIN_ recognizes and binds to in chromosomes . accumulation of _PROTEIN_ transcripts was examined by rna blot hybridization analysis . total rnas were isolated from leaf stem flower or silique and subjected to hybridization with the cdna probes for _PROTEIN_ . transcripts were found in all tissues examined especially in flowers . tissue specific accumulation of _PROTEIN_ protein was then examined using polyclonal anti _PROTEIN_ antibodies . the crude extracts were subjected to _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ protein with a molecular _METHOD_ of kd was detected by western blot hybridization . _PROTEIN_ was shown to be almost ubiquitously distributed although accumulation was undetectable in roots . the protein was found to be relatively abundant in seedlings . to further analyze the precise location of _PROTEIN_ at both intracellular and organ levels a chimeric construct of genomic dna of _PROTEIN_ and the _METHOD_ gene was introduced into arabidopsis . in the transgenic plants accumulation of fusion protein could be regulated by the promoter and splicing of the _PROTEIN_ gene itself . thus localization of _METHOD_ can be considered to reflect the localization of _PROTEIN_ protein . as a reference the fused construct driven by the camv promoter was also used . the progeny of both transgenic lines was analyzed for _METHOD_ _METHOD_ in various parts . when the authentic promoter was used _PROTEIN_ was found to be exclusively _PROTEIN_ in the _LOCATION_ in root meristem cells at tips . this is a clear contrast to the control in which _PROTEIN_ was driven by the camv promoter showing _METHOD_ signals all over the root cells . in both cases however _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was observed in _LOCATION_ consistent with observations in onion epidermal cells . _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was strong in pistils again showing a clear contrast to the control with which _METHOD_ spread all over the flower organs . _METHOD_ signals were also observed in young seeds and upon more detailed observation heart embryos were shown to be the dominant sites of _PROTEIN_ . these observations indicate that _PROTEIN_ is predominantly _PROTEIN_ in actively proliferating cells and that it is present at a certain level even in quiescent mature tissues .
