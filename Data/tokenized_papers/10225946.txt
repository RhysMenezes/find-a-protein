phytochrome is a ubiquitous photoreceptor of plants and is encoded by a small multigene family . we have shown recently that a functional _LOCATION_ localization signal may reside within the _PROTEIN_ terminal region of a major member of the family phytochrome b _PROTEIN_ . in the present study a fusion protein consisting of full length _PROTEIN_ and the green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ was overexpressed in the _PROTEIN_ mutant of arabidopsis to examine subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ in intact tissues . the resulting transgenic lines exhibited pleiotropic phenotypes reported previously for _PROTEIN_ overexpressing plants suggesting that the fusion protein is biologically active . immunoblot analysis with anti _PROTEIN_ and anti _METHOD_ monoclonal antibodies confirmed that the fusion protein accumulated to high levels in these lines . _METHOD_ microscopy of the seedlings revealed that the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein was localized to the _LOCATION_ in light grown tissues . interestingly the fusion protein formed speckles in the _LOCATION_ . analysis of confocal optical sections confirmed that the speckles were distributed within the _LOCATION_ . in contrast _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was observed throughout the cell in dark grown seedlings . therefore _PROTEIN_ translocates to specific sites within the _LOCATION_ upon photoreceptor activation .
to examine biological activity and intracellular localization of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein the _PROTEIN_ mutant of arabidopsis was transformed with a vector harboring the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ construct . the resulting transgenic lines _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ exhibited an overall dwarfing of mature plants under continuous white light . they flowered a few days _PROTEIN_ than the wild type under the conditions tested . similar phenotypes which are opposite to those of the _PROTEIN_ deficient mutants have been reported in _PROTEIN_ overaccumulating plants . hence the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein is likely to be fully functional . it is known that inhibition of hypocotyl elongation by continuous red light is mediated primarily by _PROTEIN_ . to confirm the biological activity of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ further heterozygous progeny of the _PROTEIN_ plant was examined for this response . the seedlings were grown under continuous red light for d and hypocotyl lengths were determined . as shown in fig . citation a short population segregated from a longer one at about a ratio . hypocotyl lengths in the longer population matched well with those in the parental _PROTEIN_ mutant . in contrast the shorter seedlings were significantly shorter than the wild type seedlings which is consistent with the _PROTEIN_ overexpression phenotypes reported by other groups . cosegregation of the short phenotype with the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was then examined . as expected all the short seedlings exhibited _METHOD_ _METHOD_ whereas no _METHOD_ was observed in the longer seedlings . the seedling phenotype was examined in darkness as well . as is the case with the _PROTEIN_ overexpressing plants no clear segregation of shorter seedlings was observed in the _PROTEIN_ heterozygous progeny . the average hypocotyl lengths in the _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ populations were indistinguishable . hence _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was suggested to be not only biologically but also photochemically active . to examine the accumulation of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein in the transgenic plants immunoblot analysis was performed . proteins were extracted from rosette leaves of the _PROTEIN_ plants and probed with anti _PROTEIN_ and anti _METHOD_ antibodies . the anti _PROTEIN_ mab detected a major band of kd in the _PROTEIN_ extracts . the size was consistent with the expected _METHOD_ of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein . a band at the same size was detected with the anti _METHOD_ antibody confirming that the band represented the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein . the higher intensity of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ band compared with that of the authentic _PROTEIN_ indicated that the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was overaccumulated in the transgenic plants . a similar result was obtained for the other transgenic line _PROTEIN_ . in addition to the major kd band a weak band of kd was detected in the _PROTEIN_ plants . the intensity of the band was comparable to that of authentic _PROTEIN_ . to confirm that the fragment is larger than the authentic _PROTEIN_ extracts from the _PROTEIN_ and the wild type plants were mixed and probed with the anti _PROTEIN_ antibody . as expected the two bands were separated on the blot . since the fragment was not detected with anti _METHOD_ antibody it is speculated that proteolysis of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ within the _METHOD_ portion yielded this fragment . in accordance with this minor bands around kd were detected on the anti _METHOD_ blot . in the absence of the protease inhibitor cocktails fragmentation was much more severe . hence the kd fragment is likely to be produced by the residual proteolytic activity in the extract during the extraction procedure . intracellular localization of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein in the _PROTEIN_ seedlings was examined . epidermal layers including cortex were peeled from the light grown seedlings and observed under a _METHOD_ microscope . at lower magnification bright green spots of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ were observed . positions of the spots matched well with those of the _LOCATION_ revealed by the hoechst staining . similar _METHOD_ images were obtained for another transgenic line _PROTEIN_ . interestingly observation at higher magnification revealed that the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was speckled within the _LOCATION_ region . the apparent size of each speckle appeared to be < . although speckles were observed in all of the _LOCATION_ the number per _LOCATION_ varied . in most cases one _LOCATION_ contained speckles . the intracellular localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was then examined in other parts of the seedling . as shown in fig . citation _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ was confirmed in leaf root and root hair cells . furthermore the speckles were observed in all of the cell types examined . to determine the spatial distribution pattern of the speckles within the _LOCATION_ optical sectioning of the cell with a confocal microscope was performed . for this purpose trichomes were chosen for observation because of the large size of their _LOCATION_ . as shown in fig . citation the speckles appeared to be distributed more or less evenly in the _LOCATION_ . in this particular case at least spots were recognized . this is probably due to the large size of the trichome _LOCATION_ . the images clearly demonstrated that the size of each speckle varied substantially even within one _LOCATION_ . a previous study suggested that the _LOCATION_ localization of _PROTEIN_ is light dependent . in accordance with this weak _METHOD_ was observed throughout the cell in _PROTEIN_ dark grown seedlings . since the intensity of _METHOD_ was low it was difficult to determine the intracellular localization in detail . however higher intensity in the peripheries of the cells indicated that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was distributed in the cytoplasm . those cells were highly vacuolated and the cytoplasm was observed mostly in the peripheral region as observed by dic microscopy . in some cells _METHOD_ was observed not only in the peripheries but also in the _LOCATION_ region . however it was difficult to conclude that the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ exists inside the _LOCATION_ even by confocal observation . intracellular distribution of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in the light and darkness was compared in root tip cells with a confocal microscope . as shown in fig . citation j the speckles of _METHOD_ were observed in light grown seedlings . in contrast relatively uniform _METHOD_ was observed in the peripheries of the cells in dark grown seedlings which provided further evidence that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was distributed outside the _LOCATION_ and throughout the cell in darkness . the time course of _LOCATION_ accumulation of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ during the dark to light transition was followed . the _PROTEIN_ dark grown seedlings were transferred under continuous red light . as shown in fig . citation _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ was not clear at time . after h in red light the intensity of the _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ signal was increased . however _METHOD_ remained detectable in the periphery of the cells . speckles in the _LOCATION_ were rarely observed at this time point although a few tiny spots were detected in some cases . after h in red light many small speckles were observed . _METHOD_ in the cell periphery was greatly reduced . after h in red light the speckles became larger but the number per _LOCATION_ was reduced . hence translocation of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ to the _LOCATION_ appeared to be completed within h in hypocotyl cells under continuous red light . in the course of these experiments we noticed that the translocation took longer in root cells although the reason for this was not clear .
the _PROTEIN_ mutant of arabidopsis thaliana _LOCATION_ was used as the host for transformation . arabidopsis thaliana _LOCATION_ and the _PROTEIN_ mutant were used as controls for physiological immunochemical and microscopic experiments . a full length _PROTEIN_ cdna clone was isolated from an arabidopsis cdna library . cloned _PROTEIN_ cdna was almost identical to a previously reported sequence except that a c to t substitution at the base position which does not cause amino acid difference was detected . to construct the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion sequence _PROTEIN_ translational termination codon was replaced with an oligonucleotide sequence by pcr . this oligonucleotide introduces a unique clai restriction site at its terminus . the _METHOD_ clone _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was a kind gift from dr. j. sheen _METHOD_ . this clone contains a unique clai restriction site that shortly precedes the _PROTEIN_ start codon of the _METHOD_ gene . the _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ clones were ligated at the clai restriction site to generate _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ translational fusion . as the result an oligoamino acid sequence was inserted between the _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ amino acid sequences . this _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ chimeric cassette was inserted between the constitutive cauliflower mosaic virus promoter and the nos terminator of an agrobacterium transformation vector pbi nost which is derived from another transformation vector hm by removing its uida gene . the resulting vector was designated pbi _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ nost . arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ mutant was transformed using agrobacterium mediated in planta transformation . transformed plants were selected on the medium containing mg hygromycin b and mg claforan . the transgenic lines _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were selected from the drug resistant lines by _PROTEIN_ immunoblotting and _METHOD_ _METHOD_ microscopy . for growth of plants seeds were sown on agar plates containing the murashige skoog medium with sucrose and grown under continuous white light from _METHOD_ tubes . the plants were then transplanted to pots containing vermiculite and grown to maturity under continuous white light from _METHOD_ tubes . for the immunochemical detection of the fusion protein rosette leaves were harvested from wk old plants . for the hypocotyl assay and microscopic observation seeds were sown on agar plates containing murashige skoog salt mixture without sucrose . the plates were placed at for h and then irradiated with continuous white light for h at to induce germination . for the hypocotyl assay seedlings were grown for d under continuous red light from red _METHOD_ tubes or in darkness . for microscopic observation seedlings were grown for d under continuous white light from _METHOD_ tubes or in darkness . to detect the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein and the authentic _PROTEIN_ g of rosette leaves was glass homogenized in the presence of ml of the phytochrome extraction buffer containing proteinase inhibitor cocktails for general use and for fungal and yeast extracts at the concentrations recommended by the manufacturer . debris was removed by centrifugation . proteins were concentrated from the crude homogenate by ammonium sulfate precipitation . the precipitated protein was dissolved in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ sample buffer and subjected to immunoblot analysis . antibodies used were an anti _PROTEIN_ mab and an anti _METHOD_ mab . molecular weight markers _PROTEIN_ were from sigma chemical co. arabidopsis seedlings were soaked in hoechst no . solution made in for visualization of the _LOCATION_ in some experiments . epidermal layers including cortex were peeled from the hypocotyls and placed on glass slides . for the other parts of seedlings whole organs were placed on glass slides and pressed gently . the specimens were observed using an olympus microscope equipped with and objectives differential interference contrast optics and a w mercury arc light source . _METHOD_ was filtered using uv or fitc filter sets . for confocal microscopy trichomes were removed from the surface of cotyledons with a razor blade and placed on glass slides . root tips were placed on glass slides without any pretreatment . the specimens were observed using an inverted laser scan microscope _PROTEIN_ equipped with and objectives . the laser scan images were obtained with a combination of nm laser excitation and nm longpass emission filter . sequential images from different focus planes were recorded automatically .
