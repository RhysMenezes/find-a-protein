pollen development as well as pollen germination and pollen tube growth requires a highly regulated supply of sugars . in this paper we describe the molecular kinetic and physiological characterization of _PROTEIN_ a new member of the h /monosaccharide transporter family in arabidopsis thaliana heynh . heterologous _PROTEIN_ in yeast showed that _PROTEIN_ is a high affinity broad spectrum and uncoupler sensitive monosaccharide transporter of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . in reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction analyses we found that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is restricted to flowers . furthermore _PROTEIN_ promoter _METHOD_ plants revealed that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is only found in pollen tubes . using a specific antibody we could also detect the _PROTEIN_ protein exclusively in pollen tubes but not in other flower tissues or in pollen grains of any developmental stage . these results suggest that the newly identified _PROTEIN_ transporter plays a role in the supply of monosaccharides to growing pollen tubes .
the near completion of the arabidopsis genome revealed the existence of additional monosaccharide transporter genes that had not been identified in previous screenings . one of these genes _PROTEIN_ was identified on chromosome _PROTEIN_ . computer analysis for splice site predictions and comparison with other atstp genes suggested an _PROTEIN_ open reading frame of bp interrupted by two putative introns . to further investigate _PROTEIN_ we firstly isolated the full length cdna by rt pcr with total rna from flowers of different developmental stages . the bp fragment was ligated into pgem t easy yielding construct and the absence of pcr mistakes and the position of the two introns were re confirmed by comparison with the genomic sequence . the encoded _PROTEIN_ protein is amino acids long has a calculated molecular _METHOD_ of kda and an isoelectric point of . furthermore the _PROTEIN_ protein sequence has three consensus sequence motifs for potential n glycosylation at positions and . the alignment shown in fig . demonstrates the high degree of homology of the _PROTEIN_ protein to the so far characterized arabidopsis monosaccharide transporters _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . in addition the positions of introns are strongly conserved with having introns at positions and _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ at positions and and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ at positions and . the determined _PROTEIN_ cdna sequence verifies the predicted annotation for the _PROTEIN_ gene locus _GENE_ on chromosome . to investigate its transport properties we _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in the hexose transport deficient yeast mutant . to this end we cloned the cdna sequence of _PROTEIN_ into the yeast _PROTEIN_ vector _PROTEIN_ n . as shown in fig . the yeast strain _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in sense orientation _PROTEIN_ the ability to accumulate _PROTEIN_ while _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ gene in antisense orientation in this null mutant background did not restore the uptake . _PROTEIN_ accumulation was maximal at ph which is in agreement with the ph optima determined for the other atstps . was further used to determine the substrate specificities of _PROTEIN_ . like most of the atstps characterized so far _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ can transport a broad spectrum of monosaccharides at comparable rates . galactose mannose xylose and o methylglucose show of the _PROTEIN_ uptake rate while fructose and ribose are not transported . the km of _PROTEIN_ for _PROTEIN_ was measured to be and is similar to the values determined for previously characterized atstps . low concentrations of the proton uncouplers _PROTEIN_ cyanide m chlorophenylhydrazone and dinitrophenol _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ uptake significantly confirming that sugar uptake via _PROTEIN_ is driven by a proton gradient across the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . taken together heterologous _PROTEIN_ in yeast demonstrates that _PROTEIN_ is an energy dependent high affinity monosaccharide/h symporter of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . with the exception of which is found in all green leaves all of the atstp genes characterized so far in arabidopsis are specifically _PROTEIN_ in sink tissues . in order to investigate the spatial and developmental _PROTEIN_ profile of _PROTEIN_ we performed rt pcr with rna preparations isolated from to day old seedlings from leaves _METHOD_ and roots of to week old plants and flowers and fruits of mature plants . as shown in fig . even after cycles an _PROTEIN_ specific pcr product could only be detected with cdna from flower tissue . the bp product obtained with cdna from roots is due to a weak contamination of the rna preparations with genomic dna . since we used primers spanning an intron we could unambiguously distinguish pcr products from genomic dna and cdna due to a shift in size . furthermore we verified both pcr products by sequencing . therefore this contamination product can not interfere with the specific detection of the _PROTEIN_ transcript . the results from the rt pcr analysis indicate a flower specific _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ gene . to further examine the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in flowers transgenic arabidopsis plants were generated which drive the _PROTEIN_ of the _METHOD_ reporter gene under the control of the _PROTEIN_ promoter . to this end an ncoi fragment containing bp of the _PROTEIN_ promoter sequence upstream of the start codon was cloned in front of the _METHOD_ reporter gene and introduced into arabidopsis resulting in independent _PROTEIN_ resistant transformants . detectable reporter gene activity was found in of these transgenic lines in the generation . a representative line is shown in fig . where _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ under the control of the _PROTEIN_ promoter was only found in pollen grains shortly before germination and in growing pollen tubes . for better visualization of _METHOD_ reporter _PROTEIN_ we performed an in vitro pollen germination assay . here the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was strongly visible and re confirmed the _PROTEIN_ promoter activity in germinating pollen grains and elongating pollen tubes . to also detect the _PROTEIN_ protein in pollen we raised a specific antibody . since the c terminus is the most variable region within the atstp protein family we used the last amino acids of the _PROTEIN_ protein fused it to the maltose binding protein and injected a rabbit with the e. coli _PROTEIN_ fusion protein . the generated antiserum was tested in western blot analyses with yeast extracts where it specifically recognized a kda band in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ but not in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or in strains _PROTEIN_ the other atstp genes in sense orientation . for localization studies in arabidopsis the antiserum was affinity purified against the _PROTEIN_ full length protein _PROTEIN_ in yeast . as shown in fig . e _PROTEIN_ protein is exclusively found in germinating pollen with the strongest signals in the pollen tube . the staining in cross sections of pollen tubes clearly demonstrates that the _PROTEIN_ monosaccharide transporter localizes to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and not to internal _LOCATION_ . no _PROTEIN_ protein was detectable in other flower parts or in any other plant tissue .
escherichia coli strain was used for cloning . heterologous _PROTEIN_ was performed in saccharomyces cerevisiae strain . yeast transformation was as described by gietz et al . . arabidopsis thaliana heynh . col was grown in the greenhouse in potting soil or on agar medium in growth chambers under a h h dark regime at and relative humidity as previously described . transformations of arabidopsis thaliana were performed with agrobacterium tumefaciens strain . a bp pcr fragment containing the complete _PROTEIN_ coding sequence was amplified from a flower specific cdna library using primers _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ ligated into pgem t easy and sequenced yielding clone . the _PROTEIN_ cdna fragment from was ligated into the unique noti site of the s. cerevisiae/e . coli shuttle vector _PROTEIN_ n in both sense and antisense orientation yielding constructs and respectively . both constructs were then used to transform the hexose transporter deficient s. cerevisiae strain yielding strains and . transport tests with transgenic yeasts were performed as described by sauer and stadler . total rna was isolated as described by schneidereit et al . . rt pcr was performed according to the supplier s instructions . briefly in a reaction volume of total rna and oligo were heated to for min and quickly _PROTEIN_ on ice . after addition of of first strand buffer of m dtt and mm dntp mix the mixture was incubated at for min of m mulv reverse transcriptase was added and after further incubation for min at the reaction was heat inactivated at for min . the cdna was then used as a template for amplification in a pcr reaction with the primers _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ to detect the _PROTEIN_ transcript or with primers _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ to detect the actin transcript . a bp pcr fragment was amplified from arabidopsis genomic dna using primers _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . after digestion with ncoi the resulting bp fragment was ligated into the ncoi site of the vector _METHOD_ k and sequenced yielding construct . a bp hindiii/ecori fragment containing the _PROTEIN_ promoter sequence the _METHOD_ cassette and the nos terminator sequence was cloned into pgptv bar yielding . arabidopsis plants were transformed by floral dip with agrobacterium harboring the construct . transformation of arabidopsis resulted in independent _PROTEIN_ resistant transformants . reporter gene activity was studied in all of these plants in the generation . from the generated transgenic lines lines showed similar _METHOD_ reporter _PROTEIN_ while in lines _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was not visible . for _METHOD_ analysis in pollen tubes in vitro germination of pollen was as described in stadler et al . . splice site prediction was performed with the _METHOD_ genscan and using default parameters . two annealed oligonucleotides coding for the last amino acids of _PROTEIN_ were ligated into the saci/hindiii restriction sites of the pmal vector resulting in a translational fusion of the maltose binding protein and the _PROTEIN_ c terminus . _PROTEIN_ of this fusion protein in e. coli was induced by addition of mm isopropylthiogalactoside for min at . after separation of e. coli total proteins on preparative polyacrylamide gels the prominent fusion protein band was excised eluted from the polyacrylamide gel lyophilized and used for the immunization of two rabbits . western blots with protein extracts of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ yeasts were performed to test the quality of the antisera . for the affinity purification of the antiserum _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ proteins were blotted onto nitrocellulose and the _PROTEIN_ protein band was excised as described previously . for immunohistochemical analyses semi thin sections from methacrylate embedded arabidopsis flower tissue were incubated with affinity purified anti _PROTEIN_ antiserum and stained with anti rabbit igg fluorescein isothiocyanate isomer conjugate as described by stadler et al . .
