finding gene specific peptides by _METHOD_ _METHOD_ analysis to pinpoint gene loci responsible for particular protein products is a major _PROTEIN_ in proteomics especially in highly conserved gene families in higher eukaryotes . we used a combination of in silico approaches coupled to _METHOD_ _METHOD_ analysis to advance the proteomics insight into arabidopsis _LOCATION_ ribosomal composition and its post translational modifications . in silico digestion of all ribosomal protein sequences in arabidopsis defined the proportion of theoretical gene specific peptides for each gene family and highlighted the need for low m/z cutoffs of _METHOD_ ion selection for _METHOD_ to characterize low molecular weight highly basic ribosomal proteins . we undertook an extensive _METHOD_ survey of the _LOCATION_ ribosome using trypsin and when required chymotrypsin and pepsin . we then used custom software to extract and filter peptide match information from mascot result files and implement high confidence criteria for calling gene specific identifications based on the highest quality unambiguous spectra matching exclusively to certain in silico predicted gene or gene family specific peptides . this provided an in depth analysis of the protein composition based on high quality _METHOD_ spectra matching to peptide sequences from ribosomal proteins . these identified peptides from five gene families of ribosomal proteins not identified previously providing experimental data on of the different types of ribosomal subunits . we provide strong evidence for gene specific identification of different ribosomal proteins from these families . we also provide new information on specific sites of co and post translational modification of ribosomal proteins in arabidopsis by initiator methionine removal n terminal acetylation n terminal methylation lysine n methylation and phosphorylation . these site specific modification data provide a wealth of resources for further assessment of the role of ribosome modification in influencing translation in arabidopsis .
to develop strategies to identify ribosomal proteins from the _LOCATION_ ribosome with confidence based on peptide _METHOD_ we undertook a wide survey of the predicted ribosomal protein sequences from arabidopsis . the _PROTEIN_ release of the arabidopsis thaliana genome contains genes annotated as encoding _LOCATION_ mitochondrial or chloroplastic ribosomal proteins or ribosomal protein like proteins . these include the protein sequences of nine genes that were not annotated at the time of the barakat et al . analysis of arabidopsis ribosomal sequences that are new _METHOD_ of and . the corresponding set of predicted protein sequences were subjected to batch in silico digestion with either trypsin chymotrypsin or pepsin using an in house modified version of the published script proteogest . processing of proteogest output using custom _PROTEIN_ scripts produced a table for each enzyme containing the entire list of peptide sequences theoretically produced and for each peptide the gene and gene family from which it could be derived and a list of those peptides that were predicted to come from only one of the protein sequences . for example in silico digestion using trypsin allowing one missed cleavage produced unique peptide sequences . approximately of these peptide sequences were predicted to come from only one of the protein sequences whereas others could be derived from a number of different genes . analysis of all these data showed that many low molecular _METHOD_ peptides are produced by trypsinization of ribosomal proteins due to the high arginine and lysine content of these relatively basic protein sequences . comparison with the data published by chang et al . and giavalisco et al . on the experimental identification of ribosomal proteins showed that six protein families were not represented in either of these earlier reports the s families and and the s subunits and . these proteins are all small in size highly basic in nature and from our in silico digestions lead to especially small peptides for analysis when trypsinized . from this analysis of both theoretical digestion and published data on the ribosome a strategy was developed to maximize coverage of the ribosomal analysis . first it would be necessary to obtain a large number of unique _METHOD_ spectra to provide coverage of the likely ribosomal proteins expected in the _LOCATION_ proteome . given that of tryptic peptides were likely to be gene specific peptide identifications would be required to provide on average three to four specific peptides for each protein match depending on the number of specific proteins in the ribosome . second it would be important to use a low m/z cutoff for the selection of _METHOD_ ions for _METHOD_ analysis was chosen on the basis of the abundance of peptides below amu _METHOD_ especially in the families of proteins so far not identified in arabidopsis samples . third it would be valuable to use a simple protein display technology such as _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ to ensure that proteins were not lost for analysis due to being too basic or not dissolving in ief buffers for gel analysis or being lightly stained and not analyzed due to lack of visible spots in gel analysis of ribosomes . this was especially important because these technical reasons had been used to explain the lack of coverage of certain families in previous reports on the ribosome composition . fourth given the similarity of peptide sequences within and between ribosomal protein families it would be necessary to undertake an extensive analysis of the gene specificity of any given peptide sequence to ensure that only real gene specific matches were used as evidence of specific proteins . the protein complement of ribosomes isolated from arabidopsis cell culture was displayed by _PROTEIN_ polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis . the gel separation of the successive steps in the purification of ribosomal proteins provides a view of the _PROTEIN_ complexity of the protein sample and the refinement of the major bands of r proteins . in fig . far right lane the discrete banding pattern of the ribosomal samples is evident . to assess whether our ribosomal preparation method produced intact s ribosomes that could be dissociated into two distinct subunits by a buffer of high ionic strength we compared the sucrose density gradient sedimentation profiles of ribosome samples suspended in mm ribosome buffer of either moderate or high ionic strength . the sedimentation banding patterns of s ribosomes and and s subunits was followed by uv absorbance at and nm . this analysis revealed that at m kcl ribosomal subunits remained essentially completely associated into s ribosomes whereas at m kcl subunits were completely dissociated into and s subunits with virtually no s band detected . no other obvious uv absorbing bands were detected . for analysis of the proteins in the purified ribosomal samples three lanes each containing of ribosomal proteins were run in parallel and the _METHOD_ staining bands of the entire three lane width were excised and digested in small pieces with trypsin in separate wells of a well plate . in total a set of band regions were handled separately to provide sets of peptides from of ribosomal r proteins . a further nine sets of bands for low molecular _METHOD_ gel regions were cut from replicate gels and digested with either chymotrypsin or pepsin to increase the coverage of low molecular weight ribosomal proteins . each of the samples were separately analyzed by gradient elutions of peptides from a column into an applied _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ pulsar q tof _METHOD_ spectrometer at under the parameters outlined under experimental procedures. the raw data files generated by lc esi _METHOD_ analysis of the in gel digested _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ protein bands were divided into three groups based on the protease used and each group of data files was used to generate a .mgf peak list file for analysis by mascot as outlined under experimental procedures . peptide hits reported by mascot were filtered to remove low confidence matches and mapped on the basis of peptide sequence onto their associated r protein genes r protein families and gene specificity information using custom _PROTEIN_ scripts built around database tables of in silico predicted tryptic chymotryptic or peptic peptide sequences . these in silico digestion tables were built by using the data from proteogest . these data were automatically processed using the _PROTEIN_ script to generate peptide mapping report tables containing columns for peptide sequence _PROTEIN_ ribosomal protein family and peptide _METHOD_ match data and a column indicating whether or not the peptide sequence was gene specific . in this way each mapping between a peptide match and an r protein gene was represented by a separate row . hence gene specific peptide matches only occurred in one row of the script generated table and nonspecific peptide matches occurred in multiple rows . peptide hit information mapped onto genetic loci was then processed by the _PROTEIN_ script to automatically count the number of unique peptide sequences detected per gene in the ribosomal gene set select the highest scoring _METHOD_ spectrum for each unique detected peptide sequence and add together the peptide scores for all the best unique peptide hits for each r protein family . the same approach was used to calculate the number of gene specific peptides found and the _METHOD_ of the peptide scores for non redundant gene specific peptides found for each gene . systematic analysis of the sequences of in silico predicted gene specific peptides revealed that some of these peptides differed from each other only through isobaric leu/ile or gln/lys substitutions that would not be resolvable in our _METHOD_ analysis and would result in these spectra giving rise to search engine matches against more than one gene specific peptide sequence . this finding highlighted the importance of using only unambiguously matched _METHOD_ spectra to support gene specific protein identification . hence spectra that matched significantly to more than one peptide sequence were not allowed to contribute gene specific peptide identification counts or scores . fig . provides a flow diagram overview of the whole data analysis procedure . our analysis mapped _METHOD_ spectra as positive matches to non redundant peptides from ribosomal proteins . we also detected a high scoring match to a tryptic peptide derived from the r protein family in a separate analysis of r proteins enriched for phosphopeptides . together these data confirmed the presence of peptides from of the protein families believed to make up the ribosome . in comparison chang et al . and giavaliso et al . claimed data for and protein families respectively . only one protein family thus remains undetected in experimental ribosome preparations in arabidopsis . the four proteins are extremely small and extremely basic . the newly identified proteins from our analysis were from the s and families and the s and families . these small proteins were identified through a combination of spectral matches from trypsin chymotrypsin and pepsin digestions of low molecular _METHOD_ protein bands . inspection of the matched peptides showed that of the matches were to _METHOD_ ions smaller than m/z justifying our strategy to include low m/z _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ ions in our analysis . all the presented spectra for these newly identified proteins were family specific but none were gene specific . in the cases of the three members of two members from and three members from there are no specific peptides derived from theoretical digests . among the three members of a very small number of gene specific peptides can theoretically be produced but none were found in this analysis . one of the most taxing issues in analysis of the ribosomal dataset but of high interest to researchers is the question of heterogeneity in the proteins that make up the ribosome derived from the families of genes encoding proteins for each specific subunit . table i shows that in every case in arabidopsis ribosomal subunits are encoded by at least two and in some cases up to seven different genes with an average of three genes per subunit across the whole protein complex . importantly our data for peptide identification are based on a large _METHOD_ dataset of over matching spectra and they contain unambiguous gene specific peptide identifications . the _METHOD_ of earlier studies of the ribosome were made on the basis of much smaller datasets and although many specific member proteins were claimed in these publications the strength of the evidence in any particular case was substantially weaker than that obtained in this study . chang et al . based their _METHOD_ on peptide identifications _PROTEIN_ from _METHOD_ ions in maldi tof with only _METHOD_ based on _METHOD_ spectra of which only were gene specific _METHOD_ matches . the giavalisco et al . study was entirely based on an unknown number of _METHOD_ ions derived by maldi tof . claiming gene specific identifications within conserved protein families relies on the high confidence matching of data derived from often only a small number of individual peptides . in this context _METHOD_ spectra are much more powerful discrimination tools than the matching of _METHOD_ ion _METHOD_ from maldi tof spectra . we used a high confidence cutoff for claiming gene specific identification . for genes with only a single detected gene specific peptide the peptide had to have a peptide score equal to or greater than and an expect value below and the _METHOD_ spectrum had to be manually verified . the annotated _METHOD_ spectra for these cases are supplied in supplemental data . for genes with more than one detected gene specific peptide all peptides were required to have an expect value below and an average peptide score of at least . our analysis of gene specific peptides in silico revealed that within gene families no theoretical gene specific peptides exist and . so for these proteins no amount of spectral data will allow verification of heterogeneity of the protein population . for a further eight families the level of sequence identity is so high that few sequence specific peptides exist and hence it is rather unlikely they could be found . but for the remaining families enough theoretical gene specific peptides exist to suggest that a high coverage _METHOD_ dataset could be able to define with clarity whether gene specific data exist to justify the specific presence of gene products from different chromosomal loci . several _LOCATION_ in the assignments made by chang et al . were apparent from our further analysis . in the family chang et al . claimed specific identification of _GENE_ but the peptides they claimed as matches were actually not from this gene product but from the other member of the family _GENE_ . for this protein we also made the specific identification of a locus specific peptide . chang et al . claimed a specific gene match to two proteins from a family of four members _GENE_ and _GENE_ . however on closer inspection the peptide claimed for _GENE_ is not present in the sequence of this protein . our data strongly point to gene specific data only for _GENE_ . in the two member family chang et al . claimed gene specific identification of _GENE_ based on a single peptide but on closer inspection this peptide is indistinguishable from the peptide from the other member of this family as it is a leu/ile difference that can not be determined by _METHOD_ . the two members of are indistinguishable in our analysis there is only one theoretical peptide that could distinguish this pair but it remained undetected by _METHOD_ even though we had _METHOD_ data on peptides to this family . a similar story is evident in the family of two members . chang et al . claimed a specific peptide to _GENE_ but it is again a leu/ile difference to _GENE_ and therefore indistinguishable by _METHOD_ we had six _METHOD_ spectra to this family but were unable to provide a gene specific peptide only three exist based on theoretical digests . in chang et al . claimed specific peptides for _GENE_ but these peptides are no longer gene specific because of the discovery of a new member of _GENE_ . proteins are only kda and this gene was not annotated in the earlier versions of the arabidopsis genome . the _METHOD_ of giavalisco et al . on gene specificity were not based on gene specific peptides per se but on selecting the top match based on the molecular weight search score from a search of peptide _METHOD_ fingerprinting data thus we could not with confidence compare our data with the _METHOD_ made in this study . we found good gene specific matches for all three members and also for both members in the two member families and . in each of these cases substantial est evidence suggests that all members of these families are _PROTEIN_ and hence that there is a heterogeneous population of these _METHOD_ in ribosomes . however there are also families in the s subunit where the evidence is much more in favor of single gene products or two gene products dominating the _PROTEIN_ protein profile for example in sa and where the member specific data match closely to the est evidence for gene _PROTEIN_ . there are still families where we are unable to provide substantial evidence for which specific protein products are found in the ribosome . we found good gene specific matches for three of four members for the four member families and and for both members in the two member families and . in all of these cases substantial est evidence suggests that all members of these families are _PROTEIN_ suggesting a heterogeneous population of these _METHOD_ from the s ribosome subunit . however there are also families in the s subunit where the evidence is much more in favor of single gene products or two gene products dominating the _PROTEIN_ protein profile for example in and where the member specific data match closely to the est evidence for gene _PROTEIN_ . there are still families where we are unable to provide substantial evidence for which of the protein products are found in the ribosome . in the four p r protein families of acidic stalk proteins specific peptides were found for two of the four and three of the five protein _METHOD_ . a series of family peptides were found one each specific for the first three members of this family but only one of these met our tight specifications of gene specificity . only one gene specific peptide was found for and this had a high mascot ions score and was specific for _GENE_ which is consistent with much higher est contribution from this gene family member . the family was highlighted in a high profile analysis of ribosomal protein evolution as an example of a _LOCATION_ gene family that evolved to direct specific members to be part of the mitochondrial ribosome and retain others in the _LOCATION_ ribosome . sequence comparisons showed two types of sequences type i and type ii . the type ii proteins were shown to be translocated to the mitochondria whereas the type i proteins remained in the _LOCATION_ . chang et al . claimed peptide specific evidence for both type i and type ii proteins in the _LOCATION_ ribosome . in our analysis we were unable to find any evidence for peptides even redundantly matching the type ii proteins in our _LOCATION_ ribosome samples all peptides found were specific for type i protein members . in parallel we partially enriched ribosomes from mitochondrial samples and analyzed the analogous band on gels that matched band where peptides were found . here we found strong evidence of type ii sequences one peptide that redundantly matched to _GENE_ and _GENE_ and two peptides specific for _GENE_ and no significant evidence of _LOCATION_ type i sequences . thus we propose that the presence of type ii peptides in the study of chang et al . is likely due to mitochondrial ribosome contamination of their samples rather than the real presence of type ii proteins in the _LOCATION_ ribosome . a set of five proteins that do not represent members of the established families of ribosomal proteins were identified in this study . these were two guanine nucleotide binding family proteins several of which have been reported previously in ribosomal extracts a eukaryotic translation initiation _PROTEIN_ that is likely bound to active ribosomes and a ferritin like protein . covalent protein modifications such as acetylation methylation and phosphorylation have emerged as potentially being important _PROTEIN_ contributing to ribosomal heterogeneity in both eukaryotes and prokaryotes . in the ribosomes of higher plants studying the role of covalent r protein modification in ribosomal heterogeneity is complicated by the frequent _PROTEIN_ of relatively high numbers of different yet often highly conserved _METHOD_ of each ribosomal subunit . this situation adds another layer of complexity to the _METHOD_ based analysis of covalent r protein modification in higher plants because very often the _METHOD_ difference between two closely related peptides from two closely related r protein _METHOD_ is exactly or almost equal to the _METHOD_ difference expected from a covalent modification . hence in many cases parent ion _METHOD_ as obtained by simple _METHOD_ can not distinguish the modified peptide of one family member from a closely related unmodified peptide derived from another family member . as we demonstrate here this problem can be largely overcome through the use of lc esi q tof _METHOD_ which allows isobaric peptides of very similar structure to be distinguished on the basis of their _METHOD_ fragmentation patterns . to identify sites of covalent modification on ribosomal proteins candidate _METHOD_ spectra potentially corresponding to covalently modified peptides were identified in the complete _METHOD_ dataset through a series of mascot searches considering various combinations of acetylation formylation mono di and trimethylation and phosphorylation as variable modifications . _METHOD_ spectra for which the top mascot match was a covalently modified peptide with a peptide score greater than were manually inspected to verify the identity of the peptide and determine the exact position of the modified residue . this manual inspection process allowed near isobaric modifications such as trimethylation/acetylation and dimethylation/formylation to be distinguished on the basis that for low m/z fragment ions carrying the modification the _METHOD_ accuracy of the tof analyzer was sufficient to resolve the two near isobaric modifications . this approach revealed strong _METHOD_ evidence for unique covalently modified peptides corresponding to a total of covalent modification events . detected modification types included removal of n terminal methionine n terminal acetylation n terminal dimethylation n methylation of lysine side chains and phosphorylation . of the covalently modified peptides detected could be assigned to a specific genetic locus whereas the remaining could only be redundantly assigned to two to four members of a particular r protein family due to sequence conservation between family members . overall the results of this analysis suggest extensive covalent modification of the ribosome with at least of the ribosomal protein families exhibiting at least one covalent modification . under the stringent _METHOD_ matching criteria a total of unique n terminal peptides representing r protein families were detected . of these n terminal peptides were modified by either initiator methionine removal n terminal acetylation or both . the remaining three peptides specific to the r proteins and retained an unmodified n terminal methionine residue . five of the n terminal peptides detected representing r protein families and had parent ion _METHOD_ and cid fragmentation patterns consistent with initiator methionine removal without further modification . in these peptides the n terminal residue was either glycine proline alanine or valine consistent with previous observations that initiator methionine removal occurs preferentially when the residue immediately adjacent to the initiator methionine has a relatively small radius of _PROTEIN_ . ten of the detected n terminal peptides representing r protein families and sa were detected as ions with parent _METHOD_ and cid fragmentation patterns consistent with initiator methionine removal and acetylation on or near the n terminal residue . in these peptides the n terminal residue was invariably alanine or serine . two peptides which were specific to the r proteins and were detected with _METHOD_ support for n terminal acetylation on the initiator methionine . in the raw spectra of all but three of the putatively acetylated peptides an _METHOD_ signal peak within ppm of the expected singly charged ion of acetyl alanine acetyl serine or acetyl methionine sulfoxide was observed providing strong support for acetylation at the n terminus although o acetylation of the serine side chain can not be ruled out for peptides containing an n terminal serine . for the three putatively acetylated peptides lacking ion support for acetylation of the n terminal residue _METHOD_ signals within ppm of the expected m/z of the acetylated ion were observed . interestingly in these three peptides the residue in the second position was capable of being acetylated and hence acetylation of this second residue can not be ruled out . several mascot searches considering various combinations and types of acetylation formylation and mono di and trimethylation as variable modifications matched several spectra to a modified form of the n terminal peptide _PROTEIN_ which matches redundantly to all three members of the r protein family . the actual modifications reported by mascot varied from acetyl formyl to dimethyl trimethyl depending on which combination of variable modifications was included in the search . the high peptide scores the lack of any other significantly scoring assignments to this spectrum and the _PROTEIN_ that the spectra matched by mascot to this modified peptide were detected in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ gel bands that gave rise to other matching spectra suggested that this was a real peptide match although the exact nature of the modification was not clear from mascot results except that they introduced a total nominal _METHOD_ increase of da . upon manual inspection of the most highly scoring spectrum several lines of evidence suggested that the peptide was in _PROTEIN_ dimethylated at the n terminal proline residue and n trimethylated at the amino group of the lys residue . first in the raw spectrum signals corresponding to singly charged unmodified and ions were clearly present suggesting that the modification adding da to the parent ion _METHOD_ was located within the first five residues . this conclusion was supported by strong doubly charged and series ions that were all m/z higher than expected for the unmodified peptide . this confirmed that the modifications were localized to the first three residues pro pro lys . although a number of combinations of modifications that could occur at these residues could explain a nominal _METHOD_ increase of da these modifications could be divided into three different accurate _METHOD_ groups resolvable on the tof _METHOD_ analyzer and . calculation of the observed accurate _METHOD_ shifts of the putatively modified doubly charged and ions relative to the theoretical unmodified _METHOD_ revealed that the observed signals for these ions in the raw spectrum corresponded to respective _METHOD_ shifts of and da . that is the observed _METHOD_ of the modified and ions were respectively and ppm closer to the _METHOD_ expected for a modification than to the next most isobaric modification . this observation strongly suggested that the modifications responsible for the da _METHOD_ increase within the first three n terminal residues of were caused entirely by the addition of alkyl groups most probably five methyl groups . given that the proline n terminus is theoretically capable of accommodating up to two methyl groups and the amino group of lysine is capable of accommodating up to three we propose that the most likely explanation for the observed data is that the n terminal region of the arabidopsis _LOCATION_ r protein is n n dimethylated at the n terminal proline and n n n trimethylated at the amino group of the lys residue . mascot searches considering mono di and trimethylation of lysine as variable modifications matched _METHOD_ spectra to a total of unique lysine methylated r protein derived peptides with a parent ion delta _METHOD_ < da and peptide score > . however on closer inspection it was found that the spectra matched to nine of the peptides actually matched more strongly with unmodified isobaric peptides of similar sequence from closely related family members . manual interpretation of the highest scoring spectra for the remaining peptides revealed strong y series evidence for lysine methylation in three peptides . two of these manually confirmed peptide matches _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ where represents trimethylated lysine matched specifically to two members of the family providing strong evidence for site specific n trimethylation of lys which resides in a conserved region of _GENE_ _PROTEIN_ and _GENE_ _PROTEIN_ . the third manually confirmed hit to a lysine methylated peptide was to _PROTEIN_ which matches redundantly to the two completely homologous _METHOD_ of the r protein family _GENE_ and . the annotated spectrum for this peptide is shown in fig . . previous analyses of the eukaryotic ribosome from a variety of species have characterized a range of phosphoproteins from this complex . to obtain a more complete picture of the extent of protein phosphorylation of the arabidopsis _LOCATION_ ribosome the in gel phosphoprotein stain pro q diamond was used to obtain an in gel phosphorylation profile . significant staining was observed with the phosphostain in several regions of the _PROTEIN_ and cross referenced with the _METHOD_ stained version of the gel . ribosomal proteins identified through _METHOD_ _METHOD_ in these regions were highlighted as putative phosphorylation targets . data from samples previously analyzed from these regions were reinterrogated with mascot _PROTEIN_ using the phosphorylation modification feature . significant matches were only found for two peptides using this process and both were derived from the two _METHOD_ of _PROTEIN_ . in an attempt to identify further phosphoproteins from the samples and further validate the phosphostaining a phosphopeptide enrichment procedure using was used on trypsin digested ribosome lysates . a total of of total ribosome protein was used for phosphoprotein enrichment with the enriched fraction analyzed by nano lc _METHOD_ . resultant data were queried using mascot _PROTEIN_ with the phosphorylation modification enabled . several significant matches were obtained to phosphopeptides derived from ribosomal proteins and all except the peptides were shown to be highly enriched by the procedure . these included peptides derived from the entire family of acidic ribosomal proteins and and a specific isoform of _PROTEIN_ . the _METHOD_ spectra for all phosphopeptides were manually interrogated to ensure high levels of confidence for the match and the annotated _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ peak lists are provided in supplemental data . the spectrum is shown as an example in fig . .
predicted sequences for arabidopsis ribosomal proteins were obtained from the file _PROTEIN_ which was downloaded from the arabidopsis information resource website as part of the arabidopsis genome release . a modified version of the published perl script proteogest and custom hypertext preprocessor _PROTEIN_ scripts were used to populate peptide database tables containing rows for every tryptic chymotryptic or peptic peptide sequence predicted from the set of protein sequences annotated as ribosomal proteins or ribosomal protein like proteins whereby each row represented an individual peptide to gene association . in addition to columns for peptide sequence and arabidopsis gene index _PROTEIN_ the tables also included a column containing the name of the r protein family to which each gene belonged according to the nomenclature of barakat et al . . these tables were used to map mascot reported peptide match information onto r proteins and r protein families and were processed by additional _PROTEIN_ scripts to generate lists of peptide sequences that were only derived from single genes and calculate the predicted m/z ratios of ions of total and gene specific peptides for r protein peptide ion m/z distribution analysis . all steps were carried out on ice or at . approximately g fresh weight of arabidopsis cell culture was homogenized in ml of extraction buffer polyvinylpyrrolidone mm kcl mm bovine serum albumin mm cysteine in a waring blender for min and the homogenate was filtered through four layers of muslin . the filtrate was centrifuged for min at g and the supernatant was again centrifuged at g for min . the supernatant of this g sample was then centrifuged at g for min . in ml polycarbonate bottle assemblies ml portions of the g supernatant were then layered over ml cushions of m sucrose dissolved in ribosome buffer and centrifuged at g for h to form a crude ribosomal pellet . each crude ribosomal pellet was resuspended in ml of ribosome buffer and centrifuged at g for min to pellet insoluble material . the supernatants were combined brought to a volume of ml with ribosome buffer and ultracentrifuged through m sucrose as above . the pure ribosomal pellet was resuspended to a protein concentration of mg/ml in ribosome buffer snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at until use . this protocol yielded mg of ribosomal protein from g fresh weight of cells . for the isolation of ribosomes from mitochondria mitochondria were first purified from arabidopsis by differential centrifugation and density gradient centrifugation essentially as described by millar et al . . a concentrated suspension of mitochondria containing mg of mitochondrial protein was resuspended to a total volume of ml in ribosome buffer containing triton x . the suspension was incubated on ice for min with occasional gentle mixing . the suspension was then clarified by centrifugation at g for min and the supernatant was layered over a ml cushion of m sucrose in ribosome buffer and centrifuged at g for h. after removal of the supernatant the ribosomal pellet was resuspended in a minimal volume of ribosome buffer snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at until use . ribosome dissociation was essentially carried out according to lin and key . briefly of purified _LOCATION_ ribosomes were resuspended in of either modified ribosome buffer or modified ribosome buffer containing m kcl . resuspended samples were loaded onto a ml linear sucrose gradient in either modified ribosome buffer or modified ribosome buffer containing m kcl and subjected to ultracentrifugation at g at for h using a beckman ti rotor . fractions of were collected directly into well plates using a peristaltic pump . absorbance readings were conducted on a _PROTEIN_ optima microplate reader using flashes/well . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ gels used were acrylamide stacking gels above acrylamide _PROTEIN_ or acrylamide _PROTEIN_ in a large gel format and were run with a tris glycine buffering system . gel electrophoresis was performed at ma/gel and completed in h. approximately of ribosomal proteins were solubilized in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ sample buffer and loaded onto a polyacrylamide gel overlaid with a stacking gel . the sample underwent electrophoresis for h at ma and upon completion was fixed in a solution consisting of acetic acid and methanol overnight . following three min washes in each gels were stained with ml of pro q diamond for min and destained using three successive min washes with ml of destain solution containing mm sodium acetate and acetonitrile . after two washes in ml of for min at a time _METHOD_ images of in gel phosphorylated proteins were acquired using a typhoon _METHOD_ scanner with nm excitation a nm band pass emission filter and the photo multiplier tube set at for optimal pro q dye detection . software was used to view pro q staining of the _PROTEIN_ gel . the gel was then stained with colloidal _METHOD_ overnight with gentle rocking . following staining the solution was discarded and the gel was destained in phosphoric acid for h. tips were supplied by glygen inc. and phosphopeptide enrichment procedures were essentially those outlined by larsen et al . with some modifications . briefly tips were conditioned prior to binding of phosphopeptides by aspirating/expelling of tfa solution in five times using a pipette and expelling all of the tfa solution from the tip . before binding the ph of a sample containing of trypsin digested ribosomal peptide lysate mixture was adjusted to ph by adding one part tfa solution in to four parts peptide mixture . the peptide mixture was aspirated/expelled times using a pipette to ensure maximal binding of phosphorylated peptides to . the binding solution was then completely expelled from the tip . bound samples were washed with of acetonitrile tfa aspirating/expelling the wash solution times through the tip . this step was repeated two more times for a total of three wash steps . at the end of each wash step all of the wash solution was expelled from the tip . finally the bound phosphopeptides were eluted from the tip by aspirating/expelling of m solution in times through the tip . portions of this eluate were used for nano esi _METHOD_ analysis . for gel arrayed proteins samples to be analyzed were cut from the gels and destained twice for min in mm and acetonitrile . samples were dehydrated at in a dry block heater for min and rehydrated with of digestion solution which for trypsin and chymotrypsin consisted of mm and protease in trifluoroacetic acid and for pepsin consisted of pepsin in formic acid and incubated overnight at . peptides were extracted by adding of acetonitrile and vigorous shaking for min removing liquid and adding of acetonitrile and formic acid to the gel plugs followed by another min of shaking washes were pooled after each extraction step . samples were loaded onto self packed microsorb reverse phase columns using an agilent technologies series capillary liquid chromatography system and eluted into a _PROTEIN_ pulsar i _METHOD_ system fitted with an ionspray source _METHOD_ . peptides were eluted from the reverse phase column at using a min acetonitrile gradient in formic acid . ions were selected automatically for the collision cell utilizing the information dependent acquisition capabilities of analyst _PROTEIN_ version _METHOD_ and the rolling collision energy feature for automated collision energy determination based on the m/z of the ions . the method used a s tof _METHOD_ scan that automatically switched to a s product ion scan _METHOD_ when a target ion reached an intensity of greater that counts and its charge state was identified as or . tof _METHOD_ scanning was undertaken on an m/z range of m/z using a transmission window of amu . product ion scans were undertaken at m/z ranges of m/z at low resolution utilizing transmission windows of and amu . for ribosomal protein lysates samples were digested with trypsin in mm overnight at . for initial analyses digested samples of were analyzed directly or after selection as above except bound peptides were eluted over a min period formic acid at . the analysis method used was similar to that described above except a tof _METHOD_ scan range of m/z was used with a transmission window of amu . for more detailed analyses samples of were analyzed on a _PROTEIN_ pulsar i _METHOD_ system _METHOD_ fitted with a nanoes source outfitted with a new objective _PROTEIN_ to allow direct liquid chromatographic coupling to the source . samples were loaded using an series capillary lc system onto a capillary sample trap column containing a cm insert at in acetonitrile and formic acid . bound peptides were eluted at nl/min into the _METHOD_ spectrometer after automatically switching a retrofitted port nanobore valve on the _PROTEIN_ pulsar i by an series nano pump . peptides were eluted over a min period and analyzed using parameters similar to those outlined above for lc _METHOD_ analysis of lysates . resulting _METHOD_ derived spectra were analyzed against an in house arabidopsis database comprising _PROTEIN_ from tair and the mitochondrial and _LOCATION_ protein sets . this sequence database contained a total of protein sequences . mascot generic format _METHOD_ peak lists were generated from raw sciex analyst format data files with mascot daemon using the mascot.dll for analyst _PROTEIN_ data import filter available from _PROTEIN_ science . the settings used for _METHOD_ peak list generation were centroid survey scan ions _METHOD_ at a height percentage of and a merge distance of amu centroid _METHOD_ data at a height percentage of and a merge distance of amu reject a cid if less than peaks or if precursor _METHOD_ less than da or greater than da precursor _METHOD_ tolerance for grouping da maximum number of cycles between groups minimum number of cycles per group default precursor charge states and . searches were conducted using mascot search engine version _PROTEIN_ with the following parameters _METHOD_ _LOCATION_ tolerances of ppm for _METHOD_ and da for _METHOD_ max missed cleavages set to variable modification oxidation instrument set to esi q tof . results were filtered using standard scoring maximum number of hits was set to significance threshold was set at p < . for initial searching ions score cut off was set at however peptide matches were _PROTEIN_ filtered to remove peptide matches with expect values above . to test the expected confidence levels of the analytical approach false positive peptide identification rates under the matching criteria described above were estimated at by searching against a randomized version of the sequence database used for real searches . more extensive protein modification options were used after initial matching was performed with putative modified peptide spectra manually interpreted to confirm modification . mascot peptide match reports thus produced were exported to comma separated value text file format and parsed with a custom _PROTEIN_ script to collect and filter peptide match results map peptide hits onto r protein genes and r protein families produce customized tab delimited text and html reports quantitatively summarizing _METHOD_ evidence for the detection of specific r protein genes and r protein families and automatically generate annotated _METHOD_ spectral _METHOD_ in scalable vector graphics format for manual verification of peptide identifications in cases where a protein identification was supported by a single spectrum . the script included steps to filter out peptide matches with expect values above a threshold value of select the highest scoring _METHOD_ match to each non redundant peptide sequence _PROTEIN_ and use the tables of in silico predicted peptides described earlier under in silico digestion analysis to automatically assign and count total and gene specific peptide hits to r protein genes and total peptide hits to r protein families and sum the mascot ions scores for each of the resultant sets of unique top scoring hits to total and gene specific peptides assigned to each r protein and r protein family . to avoid false positive _METHOD_ of gene specific r protein identification based on ambiguous spectra _METHOD_ spectra that gave significant matches to more than one peptide sequence were not allowed to contribute to gene specific peptide counts and scores . size analyses of theoretical peptides derived from ribosomal proteins following cleavage by different enzymes are provided in supplemental data . generic format data files generated from the primary _METHOD_ spectra based on the script explained above are provided as supplemental data these can be directly reanalyzed on line at _PROTEIN_ science by the reader . detailed information of the _METHOD_ spectra matching and individual peptide scores and sequence coverage information that form the basis of the identifications in table i are provided in supplemental data . detailed information about the _METHOD_ spectral matching and peptide scores for gene specific matches to members of protein families among s l and p ribosomal proteins are in supplemental data together with annotated _METHOD_ spectra and _METHOD_ peak lists for gene specific identifications and protein families supported by single peptide identifications and the protein families and . detailed information of the _METHOD_ spectra matching and peptide scores for gene specific matches to non ribosomal proteins identified is supplied in supplemental data . detailed information on the spectra interpreted for different classes of post translational modified peptides is presented in supplemental data annotated centroided and deisotoped spectra supporting these post translational modification _METHOD_ are provided in supplemental data .
