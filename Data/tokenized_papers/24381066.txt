fructose is a major storage form of sugars found in _LOCATION_ yet the molecular regulation of _LOCATION_ fru transport is poorly studied . although _PROTEIN_ has been characterized as a _LOCATION_ fru exporter in leaves its _PROTEIN_ in leaves is low . here rna analysis and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein fusions _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis reveal that _PROTEIN_ is highly _PROTEIN_ in the cortex of roots and localizes to the tonoplast of root cells . _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in roots was inducible by fru and darkness treatments that activate accumulation and release of _LOCATION_ fru respectively . mutation and ectopic _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ led to increased and _PROTEIN_ root growth in the presence of fru respectively . overexpression of _PROTEIN_ specifically reduced the fru content in leaves by during cold stress . these results intimate that _PROTEIN_ functions as a fru specific uniporter on the root tonoplast . _LOCATION_ overexpressing _PROTEIN_ showed increased fru uptake compared with the wild type . _PROTEIN_ mediated fru uptake was insensitive to _PROTEIN_ or treatment with or _PROTEIN_ cyanide m chlorophenyl hydrazone indicating that _PROTEIN_ functions as an energy independent facilitative carrier . the arabidopsis genome contains a close paralog of _PROTEIN_ in clade iv _PROTEIN_ . the predominant _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in root _LOCATION_ and reduced root growth of mutants under fru excess indicate that _PROTEIN_ also functions as a _LOCATION_ transporter in roots . we propose that in addition to a role in leaves _PROTEIN_ plays a key role in facilitating bidirectional fru transport across the tonoplast of roots in response to metabolic demand to _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ fru homeostasis .
a very recent report had indicated that _PROTEIN_ functions as a fru exporter in leaf _LOCATION_ . however _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ appeared to be very low in leaves indicating that _PROTEIN_ may predominantly function in sink organs other than leaves . a quantitative reverse transcription pcr analysis revealed that _PROTEIN_ mrna was _PROTEIN_ to high levels in roots of week old seedlings . in soil grown mature plants some aerial organs i.e . _METHOD_ flowers and siliques also accumulated high levels of _PROTEIN_ transcripts . by contrast _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ was comparatively low in both young and mature leaves . the high levels of _PROTEIN_ transcripts in roots observed here correlated well with the steady state _PROTEIN_ profile from the arabidopsis _METHOD_ browser and the translatome database . because steady state mrna levels do not necessarily reflect protein abundance translational fusions were analyzed . we generated transgenic arabidopsis plants _PROTEIN_ a c terminal translational gus gene fusion of _PROTEIN_ driven by the native _PROTEIN_ promoter _PROTEIN_ . in particular the full length of _PROTEIN_ gene containing all introns was used to observe the abundance and localization of the protein in planta . in d old transgenic seedlings _PROTEIN_ gus fusion proteins were _PROTEIN_ found in cotyledons and roots . a similar _PROTEIN_ pattern was also observed in week old seedlings where however gus activity was much reduced in aerial tissues . the _PROTEIN_ pattern of _PROTEIN_ proteins was also consistent with the _PROTEIN_ pattern analyzed by plants _PROTEIN_ the gus reporter driven by the _PROTEIN_ promoter . in roots _PROTEIN_ was predominantly _PROTEIN_ in root tips and mature regions of roots while only low _PROTEIN_ was observed in the elongation zone of roots . three independent reporter lines showed comparable patterns of gus staining . hand sections of mature roots histochemically stained for gus activity further demonstrated that _PROTEIN_ predominantly accumulated in the root cortex . the cell type specific _PROTEIN_ was comparable with that of root array data from the arabidopsis _METHOD_ browser and the translatome database . in soil grown mature plants _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ gus was consistently observed to be high in roots and low in aerial tissues such as leaves _METHOD_ and flowers . when the reaction time of gus staining was doubled low and patchy _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ gus fusion proteins was observed in mature leaves . after extended staining some gus activity was also observed in the vascular tissues of flowers and the bottom of siliques but not in seeds . because _PROTEIN_ of some sugar transporters is modulated by sugar levels we investigated if sugars would affect the spatial pattern of _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ . transgenic arabidopsis seedlings _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ gus fusion proteins were grown on media supplemented with suc for d then transferred to media without or with suc glc or fru for d. histochemical staining for gus activity showed that _PROTEIN_ accumulation was similar in the presence of suc or glc but highly induced by fru in the elongation zone of roots . to test whether _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ responds to a low intracellular sugar status seedlings _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ gus fusion proteins were grown on media supplemented with suc under h daylength for d then transferred to sugar free media in the dark for an additional d. extended dark periods lead to sugar starvation . interestingly accumulation of _PROTEIN_ gus fusion proteins in the elongation zone of roots was also highly induced in darkness . the same fru and sugar starvation inducible patterns in roots were observed at the transcriptional level using _PROTEIN_ promoter gus fusions . weak induction of _PROTEIN_ gus _PROTEIN_ in leaves was also observed upon exposure to darkness or by combining darkness with cold stress . these observations are consistent with a predicted role of _PROTEIN_ as a fru uniporter for uptake of excess _LOCATION_ fru or for release of the stored fru across the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ to _PROTEIN_ fru homeostasis . to investigate whether _PROTEIN_ is targeted to the tonoplast also in roots we generated transgenic arabidopsis plants _PROTEIN_ a c terminal translational _METHOD_ fusion of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ driven by the native _PROTEIN_ promoter . to allow possible transcriptional regulation the full length genomic _PROTEIN_ gene was used . confocal images of intact roots from homozygous transformants revealed that the _METHOD_ derived from _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion proteins was predominantly present at the tonoplast of root tip cells . _LOCATION_ localization was evidenced by _METHOD_ surrounding small premature _LOCATION_ located inside the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ that also stained with . a tonoplast localization was also observed in mature regions of roots as shown by _METHOD_ lining the inner side of the _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . the _METHOD_ derived from _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion proteins in the _LOCATION_ or at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ was absent . as expected tonoplast specific localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was also observed in mesophyll protoplasts . despite overall low levels of _METHOD_ in leaf tissues _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ in arabidopsis protoplasts was clearly lining chloroplast _METHOD_ toward the _LOCATION_ and not detected at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . these observations may indicate that _PROTEIN_ locates to and functions predominantly at the tonoplast of roots . high levels of _LOCATION_ fru inhibit root growth and arrest seedling development . if _PROTEIN_ could act as a _LOCATION_ importer to store excess fru in roots as suggested by _PROTEIN_ patterns altered _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ could affect intracellular fru partitioning and thereby affect the sensitivity of roots to fru toxicity . to test this hypothesis arabidopsis knockout mutants _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ with transfer dna insertions in the _PROTEIN_ gene were obtained . while the relative root growth of the segregating wild type and mutants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was similar when grown on media with or without suc root growth of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ seedlings was significantly more sensitive to to fru compared with the wild type . _PROTEIN_ thus appears to contribute at least partially to fru tolerance in roots . we therefore tested whether _PROTEIN_ is also sufficient for fru tolerance . we generated transgenic arabidopsis plants overexpressing the full length genomic _PROTEIN_ gene driven by the constitutive cauliflower mosaic virus promoter . in d old seedlings reverse transcription pcr analysis showed that levels of _PROTEIN_ transcripts in homozygous overexpressing lines _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were highly increased compared with plants transformed with the empty vector . in contrast to the increased sensitivity of root growth in _PROTEIN_ mutants three independent overexpressor lines _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ showed enhanced tolerance compared with wild type plants in the presence of to fru . excess sugars are known to inhibit seed germination . to examine if _PROTEIN_ also contributes to fru translocation during early seedling development we compared germination rates of mutants and overexpressors subjected to excess fru . however after to d of incubation we did not observe significant differences between the overexpressor or mutant lines and the wild type . the induction of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ by energy starvation indicates that _PROTEIN_ may be able not only to import but also to export fru stored in the _LOCATION_ into the _LOCATION_ when there is a metabolic demand . to examine how the increased export activity of _PROTEIN_ proteins affects the capacity of _LOCATION_ to store sugars we determined the sugar content of leaves of _PROTEIN_ overexpressors under standard growth conditions and in response to cold stress for week . cold stress had been shown to induce fru accumulation in _LOCATION_ by to fold within h . under standard conditions no dramatic differences in leaf sugar levels were observed when comparing the wild types and overexpressors . however under cold stress conditions the fru content of leaves of _PROTEIN_ overexpressor plants was significantly reduced by compared with the wild type transformed with the empty vector . no significant differences in levels of glc suc and other sugars were observed in cold stressed overexpressors . these results provide functional evidence that _PROTEIN_ is involved in _LOCATION_ fru export in planta . the sensitivity of root growth to fru inhibition in _PROTEIN_ mutants and the _PROTEIN_ fru content in cold stressed _PROTEIN_ overexpressors indicated that _PROTEIN_ mediates bidirectional fru specific transport in vivo . to directly measure the transport properties of _PROTEIN_ leaf _LOCATION_ were isolated from overexpressor plants grown under standard conditions and used to perform time course uptake assays with suc glc and fru . _LOCATION_ isolated from _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mesophyll protoplasts exhibited enhanced time dependent fru uptake activity compared with those isolated from control leaves . by comparison the uptake activities for glc or suc were not significantly increased . these results show that _PROTEIN_ can import fru specifically into _LOCATION_ along a concentration gradient in vivo . to confirm if _PROTEIN_ acts as a uniporter as indicated from phenotypes we examined the effect of _PROTEIN_ the uncoupler or a protonophore _PROTEIN_ cyanide m chlorophenyl hydrazone on fru uptake activity mediated by _PROTEIN_ . after an incubation time of min in the presence of mm fru and mg _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ from plants overexpressing _PROTEIN_ had taken up times more fru compared with those _PROTEIN_ the empty vector . the absence of _PROTEIN_ as well as treatments of or cccp which disrupt the preexisting proton gradient had no significant impact on transport activity . to investigate the affinity of the _LOCATION_ fru transporter we performed a concentration dependent uptake experiment . saturation of fru uptake was not observed at concentrations up to mm that were used here . the estimated km and vmax values of _PROTEIN_ activity were mm and pmol fru _LOCATION_ min respectively demonstrating that _PROTEIN_ is a low affinity fru transporter . the arabidopsis genome contains a close homolog of _PROTEIN_ in clade iv named _PROTEIN_ . in a recent study _PROTEIN_ was also shown to function as a _LOCATION_ sugar facilitator in vascular parenchyma cells . however the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ measured using a promoter gus fusion is relatively low in most tissues including roots . because _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ proteins share amino acid identity we suspected that _PROTEIN_ may play a partially redundant function with _PROTEIN_ in roots under certain environmental stimuli . to address this hypothesis we performed similar experiments as for _PROTEIN_ . interestingly the qrt pcr analysis showed predominant _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ mrna in roots compared with all aerial organs such as leaves _METHOD_ and flowers in both young seedlings and mature plants . the _PROTEIN_ pattern was consistent with the developmental _PROTEIN_ profile from the arabidopsis _METHOD_ browser and the translatome database . to investigate if _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are the only sweet genes highly _PROTEIN_ in roots we performed qrt pcr to analyze _PROTEIN_ levels of all arabidopsis sweet genes in roots . under the condition tested _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ genes which are part of clade iv were the most highly _PROTEIN_ sweet genes a few other sweet genes were _PROTEIN_ at low levels in roots . the pattern was consistent with the _PROTEIN_ profile derived from the atgeneexpress database . to analyze the tissue specific _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ proteins we generated transgenic arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ c terminal translational fusions to gus and _METHOD_ under the control of the native _PROTEIN_ promoter _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ again using the full length genomic _PROTEIN_ gene . similar to _PROTEIN_ both _PROTEIN_ gus fusion proteins and promoter activity were _PROTEIN_ detected in roots . _PROTEIN_ fusions accumulated predominantly in the cortex of mature roots . the cell type specific _PROTEIN_ was consistent with the arabidopsis _METHOD_ browser and the translatome database . confocal images of intact roots in homozygous transformed seedlings clearly demonstrated that the _METHOD_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion proteins localized to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ in roots . to functionally characterize _PROTEIN_ in planta we obtained arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ t dna insertion knockout mutants and generated a _PROTEIN_ double mutant as well as _PROTEIN_ overexpressor lines . _LOCATION_ isolated from _PROTEIN_ showed a marked _PROTEIN_ in fru uptake activity . although overexpression of _PROTEIN_ in leaves did not increase the fru transport activity the fru content in leaves was significantly _PROTEIN_ in response to cold stress compared with standard conditions . these results imply that _PROTEIN_ is probably involved in fru transport in planta although under the conditions tested to a much lower degree than _PROTEIN_ . consistent with this observation root growth of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ seedlings was significantly more sensitive to to of fru than the wild type . however compared with _PROTEIN_ single mutants the _PROTEIN_ double mutant did not show enhanced sensitivity to excess fru . overexpression of _PROTEIN_ significantly enhanced root growth at to of fru .
