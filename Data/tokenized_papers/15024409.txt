multicellular eukaryotes produce small rna molecules of two general types microrna and short interfering rna . they collectively function as sequence specific guides to silence or regulate genes transposons and viruses and to modify chromatin and genome structure . formation or activity of small rnas requires _PROTEIN_ belonging to gene families that encode dicer and argonaute proteins and in the case of some sirnas rna dependent rna polymerase proteins . unlike many animals plants encode multiple dcl and rdr proteins . using a series of insertion mutants of arabidopsis thaliana unique functions for three dcl proteins in mirna _PROTEIN_ endogenous sirna _PROTEIN_ and viral sirna _PROTEIN_ biogenesis were identified . one rdr protein _PROTEIN_ was required for all endogenous sirnas analyzed . the loss of endogenous sirna in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants was associated with loss of heterochromatic marks and increased transcript accumulation at some loci . defects in sirna generation activity in response to turnip crinkle virus in _PROTEIN_ mutant plants correlated with increased virus susceptibility . we conclude that proliferation and diversification of dcl and rdr genes during evolution of plants contributed to specialization of small rna directed pathways for development chromatin structure and defense .
at least two _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are involved in arabidopsis mirna formation . as shown for mir mir and several other mirnas mutants with _PROTEIN_ loss of function alleles lose most of their mirna populations . plants with mutant _PROTEIN_ alleles either lose mirnas or the apparent size of mirnas is increased by one or more nucleotides . mirna function to suppress target mrnas is diminished in both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants . to determine whether other dcl or rdr proteins are required for mirna formation in arabidopsis mir and mir were analyzed in four new mutants . the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants contained t dna insertions in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ genes respectively . in wild type plants _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ transcripts accumulated to detectable levels in inflorescence tissues but not in leaves . the mutant _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ transcripts were not detected in either tissue type . the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants contained t dna insertions in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ respectively . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ transcripts accumulated in inflorescence tissue but not leaves of untreated wild type plants . the _PROTEIN_ transcript levels were elevated in salicylic acid treated leaves as shown previously but _PROTEIN_ transcript levels were not affected by sa . both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ transcripts were below the detection limit in the corresponding mutant plants . in addition a mutant containing an insertion in the _PROTEIN_ gene _PROTEIN_ was analyzed in parallel with the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants . this _PROTEIN_ mutant displayed a weak virus susceptibility phenotype that was consistent with previously reported _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants . however no differences in _PROTEIN_ transcript levels were detected between wild type and _PROTEIN_ mutant plants . mirna genes and selected loci corresponding to three sirnas or sirna populations . cloned small rna sequenc es are shown as green or red bars . protein coding and mirna genes are indicated by blue arrowheads . from top to bottom mir and mir loci loci with each sequence indicated by an asterisk and the inverted duplication shown by the gray arrows sirna locus a segment of chromosome iii showing rdna repeats containing the sequence . small rna blot assays for mir mir and endogenous sirnas . ethid ium bromide stained gels in the zone corresponding to trna and rna are shown at the bottom . each mutant is presented in a panel with the corresponding wild type control _LOCATION_ . accumulation of mir and mir was unaffected in the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants . this was in contrast to the low level or shifted mobility of mir and mir in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ respectively . similarly accumulation of mir and mir was unaffected in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants . a library of cloned small rnas from inflorescence tissues of col ecotype plants was partially sequenced and analyzed . initial characterization of of these sequences revealed that most of the clones corresponded to sirna like sequences . a total of distinct small rnas ranging in size between and nucleotides were provisionally categorized here as sirnas with nucleotides representing the most common size . the sirna sequences were identified at genomic loci . approximately of endogenous sirnas derived from transposon or retroelement sequences in the sense or antisense _PROTEIN_ . centromeric and pericentromeric sirnas were common which was partly due to the prevalence of transposons and retroelements at these sites . forty five small rnas of sense and antisense _PROTEIN_ arose from highly repeated and rdna . while it is likely that some rdna derived sequences resulted from nonspecific breakdown of highly abundant rrnas some had specific genetic requirements and properties that were consistent with functional sirnas . thirty one sirnas came from sequences annotated as psuedogenes and from hypothetical or predicted genes . only were identified as originating from genes that are known to be _PROTEIN_ . the remaining sequences mapped to loci that were collectively labeled as an igr sequence . the igr derived sirnas arose from unique sequences adjacent to known genes inverted duplications satellites and other repeated sequences although many of these may actually correspond to transposon or retroelement sequences that were not recognized by the search _METHOD_ . size distribution of endogenous sirnas . distribution of distinct sirnas in different sequence categories . density of sirnas from highly repeated _PROTEIN_ rdna and unique genomic sequence . the frequency of unique sirnas arising from highly repeated sequences _PROTEIN_ rdna repeats and nonrepetitive sequence was calculated . sirnas in the library occurred at a frequency of per kb repetitive dna which was approximately fold higher that the frequency of sirnas from nonrepetitive sequence . based on the number of repeats in the most current version of the arabidopsis genome sequence unique sirnas corresponding to rdna were identified at a frequency of per kb . these data indicate that sirnas arise more frequently from highly repeat genome sequences . a set of four sirnas or sirna populations representing the major categories identified in the library were selected for genetic analysis . twenty six sirnas corresponded to sine retroelements one of which was selected for detailed analysis . derived sirna formation requires _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . one sirna originating from rdna was selected . the rrna genes occur in tandem arrays in chromosomes iii iv and v with the typical repeat unit being composed of transcribed sequence and flanking spacer sequences . the sequence was identified in the sense orientation within the spacer sequence in repeats in chromosome iii and four repeats in chromosome v . the sirna population from a nucleotide igr segment in chromosome i was represented by seven unique sirnas in the library . finally the sequence corresponded to two loci separated by approximately kb in chromosome v. one locus occurred in an igr sequence and the other within a hypothetical gene of unknown function . the two loci occur in sequences that correspond to _METHOD_ of an inverted duplication . the and probes detected populations that accumulated as nucleotide rnas while the probe detected a population containing to nucleotide species . the abundance of each sirna population was _PROTEIN_ in the _PROTEIN_ mutant but not in the _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ mutants . this was in strict contrast to mir mir and several other mirnas tested which depended specifically on _PROTEIN_ . interestingly weak signals corresponding to sirnas and sirnas were detected in faster migrating positions in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . this may have resulted from exposure of sirna precursors to alternate dcl activities in the absence of _PROTEIN_ . notably both small and large sirnas detected by the rdna derived probe were diminished in _PROTEIN_ plants . each sirna population was eliminated in the _PROTEIN_ mutant but not in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . in preliminary experiments each sirna population was unaffected by the _PROTEIN_ mutation although these data should be interpreted cautiously because of the possibility that the _PROTEIN_ allele is weak . the endogenous sirna requirement for _PROTEIN_ contrasted with the mirnas which exhibited complete insensitivity to each of the rdr mutations tested . these data genetically identify _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ as components of an endogenous sirna generating system that differs functionally from the mirna generating apparatus . the _PROTEIN_ protein was implicated in post transcriptional silencing of sense but not hairpin forming transgenes . we tested the requirement of _PROTEIN_ for endogenous sirna formation using the _PROTEIN_ mutant . two of the sirna populations and the sirnas were reduced to undetectable levels in _PROTEIN_ plants . the and sirnas on the other hand reproducibly accumulated to higher levels in _PROTEIN_ plants compared to wild type la _LOCATION_ plants . thus each type of endogenous sirna tested requires _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ but only the highly repeated rdna and retroelement derived sirnas require _PROTEIN_ . in _PROTEIN_ the requirement for or independence from _PROTEIN_ was precisely the same as _PROTEIN_ at each of these loci . two previous studies showed that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are required for sirna accumulation and methylation of cytosine positions at the locus . in an _PROTEIN_ mutant loss of sirna is associated with _PROTEIN_ histone methylation . cytosine methylation and increased histone methylation are hallmarks of transcriptionally silent and heterochromatic dna in plants and other _METHOD_ and sirnas may recruit chromatin modification complexes to specific loci . to determine whether _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ catalyze formation of sirnas that functionally interact with chromatin cytosine methylation at and rdna loci and methylation of and positions in were examined in wild type _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ plants . we also analyzed derived transcript levels to determine whether the mutations affected _PROTEIN_ of the locus . consistent with previous reports bisulfite sequencing of genomic dna revealed extensive cpg cpnpg and asymmetric cphph methylation in col wild type plants . in the _PROTEIN_ mutant cpnpg and cphph methylation was reduced to and respectively . only a slight reduction in cpg methylation was detected in _PROTEIN_ plants . this methylation pattern was similar to that detected in mutants lacking _PROTEIN_ which is necessary for efficient methylation of at non cpg sites and in a mutant lacking _PROTEIN_ . in the _PROTEIN_ mutant however cytosine methylation was _PROTEIN_ only at asymmetric sites while cpg and cpnpg methylation was similar to that of wild type plants . analysis of cpg cpnpg and cphph methylation in by bisulfite sequencing of genomic dna . blot analysis of rdna digested with methylation sensitive restriction enzymes hpaii and _METHOD_ . hpaii is sensitive to cpg and cpnpg methylation whereas _METHOD_ is sensitive to only cpnpg methylation . methylation is indicated by the ascending ladder which corresponds to rdna multimers . duplicate samples from each plant were analyzed . _PROTEIN_ assays using antibodies against dimethyl histone and dimethyl histone . genomic dna associated with immunoprecipitated chromatin was analyzed by semiquantitative pcr with primer pairs specific for retrotransposon reverse transcriptase and pfk . the pcr products were quantitated and compared against the respective internal controls and the relative and methylation levels were _PROTEIN_ relative to that in col . detection of specific transcripts by semiquantitative rt pcr . primers specific for pfk transcripts were used as the internal control . a parallel set of reactions without addition of reverse transcriptase was run as a quality control for genomic dna contamination . the pcr products were normalized relative to pfk and the _PROTEIN_ levels were calculated relative to that in col . because of the number of rdna repeats analysis of cytosine methylation was done using restriction enzymes hpaii or _METHOD_ and dna blot assays . sensitivity to hpaii indicates lack of methylation at cpg or cpnpg sites whereas sensitivity to _METHOD_ indicates lack of methylation at only cpnpg sites . in wild type col and la _LOCATION_ plants rdna loci were heavily methylated at cpg cpnpg sites as shown by detection of only high molecular weight _METHOD_ using hpaii and partially methylated at cpnpg as shown using _METHOD_ . in _PROTEIN_ plants methylation was partially lost at cpnpg sites _METHOD_ although to a lesser degree than in _PROTEIN_ plants . methylation detected by hpaii sensitivity was partially lost in the _PROTEIN_ mutant which was most likely due to loss of cpg methylation . loss of only cpnpg methylation in _PROTEIN_ plants would not account for the increased sensitivity to hpaii as hpaii sensitivity in _PROTEIN_ plants was unaffected . sensitivity of rdna sites to hpaii and _METHOD_ in _PROTEIN_ plants was only slightly increased . in the _PROTEIN_ mutant cpg methylation was partially lost as revealed by increased sensitivity to hpaii . chromatin immunoprecipitation _PROTEIN_ assays were used to detect changes in and methylation at in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutant lines . loci containing genes encoding a retrotransposon reverse transcriptase and phosphofructokinase subunit were used as positive controls for sequences associated primarily with and methylated histone respectively . at _PROTEIN_ levels of histone methylation were detected in both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants . this was accompanied by a slight increase in methylation . the extent to which methylation changed was greater in _PROTEIN_ relative to _PROTEIN_ plants . little or no change in and methylation was detected at the control loci . in addition no changes in or methylation were detected at in _PROTEIN_ plants . the changes in methylation shown here are similar to those at several heterochromatic or silenced loci in _PROTEIN_ mutant plants . the level of derived transcripts was measured in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutant plants and compared against the level of pfk transcript using semiquantitative rt pcr . as shown in d relatively low levels of transcripts were detected in wild type col plants . however the normalized level of transcripts was over and fold higher in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutant plants respectively compared to wild type plants . therefore loss of sirna forming capability correlated with loss of heterochromatic marks and elevated transcript levels at an endogenous locus that is normally silenced at the chromatin level . given that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are involved in chromatin associated events and that _PROTEIN_ is required for accumulation of certain endogenous sirnas associated with chromatin modification it was hypothesized that each of these proteins accumulates in the _LOCATION_ . the presence of _LOCATION_ transport signals in each protein was tested by transient _PROTEIN_ and analysis of green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ fusions in a heterologous plant nicotiana benthamiana using an agrobacterium infiltration assay . subcellular accumulation sites for these proteins were compared to those of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ inclusion a protein _METHOD_ _LOCATION_ . the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion proteins were detected exclusively in the _LOCATION_ indicating that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ possess independent _LOCATION_ transport capability . subcellular localization experiments with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion proteins however were inconclusive due to low _PROTEIN_ levels and protein instability . pairwise presentation of confocal microscopic images showing _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and dapi _METHOD_ in n. benthamiana _PROTEIN_ the indicated _METHOD_ fusion proteins . arrowheads indicate the location of _LOCATION_ . note that the gus _METHOD_ control protein accumulates in cytoplasm at the cell periphery and immediately surrounding _LOCATION_ while the nia _METHOD_ control protein accumulates in _LOCATION_ . scale bar . the involvement of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in sirna formation in response to infection by three dissimilar rna viruses was tested using the dcl mutant series . two of the viruses a _METHOD_ tagged version of turnip mosaic virus _METHOD_ and turnip crinkle virus infect arabidopsis systemically and cause moderate to severe disease _METHOD_ . the third virus cucumber mosaic virus strain y infects plants systemically but causes only mild _METHOD_ . wild type _LOCATION_ and mutant plants were inoculated on rosette leaves and upper noninoculated tissue was analyzed for virus specific sirnas at and d post inoculation . viral sirnas were detected in systemic tissues from wild type plants at both timepoints with sirna levels generally higher at dpi . in tumv and cmv infected _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutant plants sirnas accumulated to levels that were similar to those in infected wild type plants at and dpi . tumv and cmv titers and symptom phenotypes in the three mutants were indistinguishable from those in their respective parents . similarly in tcv infected _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ plants viral sirna levels virus titer and symptom severity were essentially the same as in wild type plants . blot analysis of viral sirna . systemic tissue samples were analyzed at the indicated time points from parental and mutant lines that were infected with tumv _METHOD_ cmv y and tcv . rna blots were analyzed using virus specific probes to detect sirnas . ethidium bromide stained gels in the zone corresponding to trna and rna are shown . relative accumulation of sirnas is indicated at the bottom of each panel with the level measured in infected control plants _LOCATION_ at dpi arbitrarily set to . noninfected control and tcv infected col _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ plants at dpi . tcv accumulation as measured by elisa in the systemic tissues of infected wild type and mutant plants at dpi and dpi . plant height number of flowers/plant and fresh weight of bolt tissue were measured at dpi in noninfected and infected plants . in contrast tcv derived sirnas accumulated to levels that were fold lower in _PROTEIN_ plants compared to wild type plants at dpi . this was a transient deficit as tcv sirna levels rebounded to near wild type levels by dpi . the slow accumulation of sirnas was not due to lack of tcv replication or movement in the tissues analyzed as tcv titer in the _PROTEIN_ mutant was similar to or significantly higher than the titers in wild type plants . additionally tcv induced disease was more severe in _PROTEIN_ plants as plant height fresh weight of bolts and number of flowers in infected _PROTEIN_ plants were each significantly lower compared to infected wild type plants . therefore _PROTEIN_ functions as a component of the antiviral silencing response in tcv infected plants . the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein accumulated predominantly in the _LOCATION_ of n. benthamiana cells in the transient assay system although some _LOCATION_ localization was also detected . thus _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ each have _LOCATION_ transport activity .
all plants were grown under standard greenhouse conditions . the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutant lines were described previously . other mutant lines were obtained from the salk institute genome analysis laboratory and torrey mesa research institute . _PROTEIN_ has a t dna insertion within predicted intron _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ has a t dna insertion within predicted exon of _PROTEIN_ at a point nucleotides beyond the _PROTEIN_ in genomic dna . this introduces four codons after the serine codon followed by a premature stop codon . _PROTEIN_ has a t dna insertion within predicted exon after nucleotide beyond the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ has a t dna insertion within predicted exon _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ has a t dna insertion within predicted exon _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . each insertion line was backcrossed twice to col and brought to homozygosity . additional information about the insertion lines are provided in the supplemental online materials . for analysis of each insertion mutant col was the wild type control plant . for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants la _LOCATION_ was the wild type control . extraction of low and high molecular weight rnas and blot assays were done as described previously . low molecular weight rna from arabidopsis inflo rescence tissue was used for mirna and endogenous sirna analysis . probes for mir and sirna analysis were described previously . mir was detected using an end labeled dna oligonucleotide as . and were detected using the end labeled dna oligonucleotides as _PROTEIN_ and as _PROTEIN_ respectively . the probe for sirnas was a random primer labeled fragment spanning a nucleotide igr of chromosome i and was amplified from genomic dna using primers as _PROTEIN_ and s . cytosine methylation was analyzed by bisulfite sequencing of genomic dna or by dna blot assay following digestion with methylation sensitive restriction endonucleases as described elsewhere . the region of analyzed was treated with sodium bisulfite and amplified using primers _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and . at least independent clones were sequenced for each genotype . _PROTEIN_ assays were done using antibodies specific for dimethyl histone or dimethyl histone as described elsewhere . methylation of and at in wild type col and _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants was measured relative to that at internal control loci and . the data were then normalized against the values measured in col . the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ construct contained the _PROTEIN_ coding region fused to _METHOD_ coding sequence flanked by the cauliflower mosaic virus promoter and terminator sequences . the _PROTEIN_ cassette was cloned in . all other _METHOD_ fusion constructs were made by cloning the coding sequence into _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ a set of gateway compatible binary vectors designed for promoter driven _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ fusion proteins . cloning using gateway vectors was done using reagents and protocols from invitrogen . constructs were introduced into agrobacterium tumefaciens strain and _PROTEIN_ in n. benthamiana leaves as described previously . fusion proteins were detected by confocal microscopy and immunoblot assay using a monoclonal antibody against _METHOD_ . wild type and mutant arabidopsis plants were infected with tumv _METHOD_ cmv y and tcv as described previously . at and dpi systemic tissues consisting of inflorescences and cauline leaves were harvested for elisa and rna blot assays . antibodies used for tumv and tcv elisas were as described previously . computational identification of repeat sequences including transposons and retroelements in the arabidopsis genome was done using repeatmasker and repbase . further information about arabidopsis sirnas and mirnas including those that were analyzed in this work can be found in the arabidopsis small rna project database .
