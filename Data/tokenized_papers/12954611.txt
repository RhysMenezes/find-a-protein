key components of the ascorbate glutathione cycle in arabidopsis cell organelles are encoded by single organellar targeted _METHOD_ that are dual localized in the chloroplast stroma and the _LOCATION_ . we demonstrate the presence of the ascorbate glutathione cycle in purified arabidopsis mitochondria using enzymatic activity proteomic and in vitro and in vivo subcellular targeting data that identify the gene products responsible . in vitro experiments using a dual import assay assessing mitochondrial and chloroplast imports simultaneously show dual targeting of ascorbate peroxidase monodehydroascorbate reductase and glutathione reductase gene products to mitochondria and chloroplasts while a putative dehydroascorbate reductase protein is only imported into mitochondria . in vivo subcellular localization using green _METHOD_ protein fusion proteins show clear targeting of all gene products to mitochondria . transcript levels show these genes are induced by oxidative chemical stresses targeted to chloroplasts and/or mitochondria and are elevated during photosynthetic operation in the light . together these data present a model of an integrated ascorbate glutathione antioxidant defense common to _LOCATION_ and mitochondria that is linked at the level of the genome in arabidopsis .
asc glutathione cycle enzyme activities in arabidopsis mitochondria _PROTEIN_ and of apx _PROTEIN_ dhar and _PROTEIN_ activities revealed that each could be detected in arabidopsis mitochondria . the two percoll gradient method for the high purity separation of mitochondria from _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ yields mitochondria only contaminated by _LOCATION_ and essentially free from peroxisomal and _LOCATION_ compartments based on marker enzymes . maximal activities for each enzyme of the asc glutathione cycle measured in the presence of triton x were fold lower than those reported in mitochondrial preparations from other plant species but were clearly measurable above background levels of auto oxidation . the _PROTEIN_ of these activities suggested that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ activities were largely inaccessible in intact mitochondria indicating a _PROTEIN_ location . in contrast more than half the apx and dhar activities could be assayed by provision of substrates to intact mitochondria indicating a significant portion of activity is probably on the intermembrane space side of the mitochondrial inner _LOCATION_ . under the same conditions cytochrome c oxidase _PROTEIN_ was in excess of proving a high degree of _LOCATION_ integrity in our mitochondrial preparations . to further assess compartmentation of these activities fractions enriched in _PROTEIN_ proteins intermembrane space and outer _LOCATION_ vesicle proteins _METHOD_ and inner _LOCATION_ proteins _PROTEIN_ were prepared by osmotic stock and centrifugation . contamination between compartments prepared by this protocol are < for the ma and _PROTEIN_ samples and about ma and < _PROTEIN_ in the _METHOD_ om fraction . the _METHOD_ om fraction represented the _PROTEIN_ sample and the _LOCATION_ fraction of total mitochondrial protein . based on these proportions the distribution of activity between the fractions is presented as a percentage of total activity in mitochondria . by comparing the combined activities rate with the triton solubilization data the percentage activity recovery during this subfractionation process was determined to be consistent . nearly of the apx and _PROTEIN_ activities were present in the inner _LOCATION_ fraction with about in the _PROTEIN_ fraction . the low _PROTEIN_ of apx coupled to the subfractionation data for this enzyme suggests that much of this activity is likely to be on the _METHOD_ side of the inner _LOCATION_ . in contrast the high _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ coupled to subfractionation data suggests a predominantly _PROTEIN_ side localization . the _PROTEIN_ and dhar activities predominate in the _PROTEIN_ but are also found in the other fractions suggesting they are partitioned between compartments and can be partially _LOCATION_ associated . these data are consistent with the view that the majority of the apx faces the outside of the inner _LOCATION_ while an asc glutathione generating system _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ operates in the _PROTEIN_ and to a lesser extent in the _METHOD_ to regenerate asc . small gene families exist for each enzyme of the ascglutathione cycle in determine which arabidopsis genes encoded the proteins responsible for these enzymatic activities the arabidopsis predicted protein set from of the institute for genomic research genome annotation was searched by description to identify genes encoding the enzymes of the asc glutathione cycle . these protein sequences were then used in blast analysis of the protein data set to identify unannotated protein sequences with significant similarity to suggest they also represented members of these gene families . this analysis revealed there are likely apx genes _PROTEIN_ genes dhar genes and _PROTEIN_ genes in arabidopsis . further there is an extensive set of glutaredoxins that are likely to catalyze dhar activities in arabidopsis . dhar activities purified from mammalian tissues are found to be gdxn the mammalian mitochondrial gdxn has dhar activity and dhar activity of plant gdxns is widely reported . all of these genes except the apx were represented in est databases at the time of this analysis suggesting they are all _PROTEIN_ genes . predicted organelle targeting of asc glutathione cycle gene simple comparison of apparent molecular _METHOD_ of each predicted gene product within a family suggests that different classes of each protein are represented and that some have n or c terminal extensions that may represent targeting information for localization within the cell . analysis of the predicted targeting of each gene product for apx _PROTEIN_ dahr and _PROTEIN_ by three targeting prediction _METHOD_ is presented in table ii . based on the predictions by each program we have made a consensus prediction for each product as organellar targeted _LOCATION_ or unclear . from this analysis we predict that only of the genes encode proteins that are likely to be organellar targeted . in the case of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and the classical dhar family only one gene product of each class has a clearly predicted organelle targeting presequence . the three organellar apxs have already been assigned to chloroplast locations in the lumen _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and the stroma . the organellar _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are also assigned as the _PROTEIN_ chloroplast _METHOD_ in arabidopsis . a gdxn with strong mitochondrial targeting prediction is also included in table ii . proteomic evidence for presence of proteins in have also been undertaking a comprehensive program of arabidopsis mitochondrial proteome analysis using two dimensional gel electrophoresis and direct analysis of whole mitochondrial trypsin digestions . during this analysis peptides have been identified for several asc glutathione cycle enzymes that are present in purified mitochondria isolated from arabidopsis cell culture . a set of peptides match to apx _GENE_ a series of peptides match to the _PROTEIN_ _GENE_ one peptide from the _PROTEIN_ _GENE_ has been identified one peptide from the dhar _GENE_ and a set of peptides matched to a gdxn _GENE_ . matching of these peptides by proid software against the full arabidopsis protein set proved that these identifications were highly significant with most scores of greater than for matches of _METHOD_ spectra and delta _METHOD_ of < da for matches of the parent peptides _METHOD_ to predicted peptide _METHOD_ of the matched proteins . thus with the exception of dhar _GENE_ the proteins detected by proteomic analysis are all predicted to be organelle located . dual targeting of apx _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ precursor proteins to chloroplasts and the bioinformatic and proteomic analysis we decided that the most likely candidates for mitochondrial targeted proteins were apx _GENE_ _PROTEIN_ _GENE_ and _PROTEIN_ _GENE_ . the situation with dhar was not clear as proteomic data pointed to either _GENE_ or the gdxn _GENE_ while targeting predictions pointed to _GENE_ . to further resolve this situation all three proteins were used for import studies further the only other dhar significantly _PROTEIN_ _GENE_ was also included for completeness . to ensure that import rather than simply association of proteins with organelles was occurring a dual import system established in our laboratory was utilized for import of in vitro synthesized methionine labeled precursors of the test proteins and two control proteins . assessing the import properties of apx _GENE_ _PROTEIN_ _GENE_ and _PROTEIN_ _GENE_ using this system indicated that they were all imported and cleaved to a mature product in both chloroplasts and mitochondria . the mature products were protected from digestion by addition of thermolysin . in the case of apx there was an additional methionine residue residues from the initiator methionine that resulted in an additional band upon translation . in order to determine which protein was dual targeted we removed the first and second methionines independently . removal of the first methionine resulted in a single precursor protein that was still dual targeted . in contrast changing methionine to an isoleucine residue resulted in targeting only to mitochondria . mitochondrial import of apx _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ proteins were not completely valinomycin sensitive and remained protease protected . this suggests that a proportion of these proteins were not crossing the inner _LOCATION_ . such an observation is consistent with the earlier reports of partitioning of these enzyme activities between the _METHOD_ and ma fractions for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and the low _PROTEIN_ of apx activity that suggested an outer face of the inner _LOCATION_ orientation . to determine intraorganellar localization imports into mitochondria were repeated and subsequent _METHOD_ depletion _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ allowed assessment of the proportion of each imported protein that was accessible to protease in the _METHOD_ . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were used as controls to monitor the activity of proteases . _PROTEIN_ is an interfacial _LOCATION_ protein that is not exposed to the _METHOD_ and thus should remain fully protected when the outer _LOCATION_ is ruptured . _PROTEIN_ is an inner _LOCATION_ space protein with the n and c termini in the _METHOD_ . upon rupture of the outer _LOCATION_ and protease treatment the _METHOD_ domains are digested but the _LOCATION_ portions are protected . this results in a shift in apparent molecular _METHOD_ on _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ that the added protease is active in digesting _METHOD_ located proteins . upon rupture of the outer _LOCATION_ these controls show that while _PROTEIN_ is fully protected _PROTEIN_ is fully converted to a lower molecular _METHOD_ . upon rupture and salt washing of mitochondria imported apx protein was completely lost even without protease treatment indicating that it was removed in this treatment . we have previously reported that this washing procedure also removed cytochrome c from the inner _LOCATION_ . imported _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mature proteins were partially resistant to proteolysis in mitoplasts further supporting a direct partitioning of these products between the _METHOD_ and the _PROTEIN_ spaces during import . these arabidopsis proteins could also be imported into mitochondria from arabidopsis cell culture . in each case the same pattern of import was observed into arabidopsis mitochondria as had been seen in soybean mitochondria . the dhar _GENE_ and _GENE_ were not cleaved to a mature product after incubation with either organelle and were resistant to all the proteases tested in the presence and absence of organelles thus protease protection of these proteins could not be assessed to determine if import was occurring . the dhar _GENE_ predicted to be the _PROTEIN_ organellar targeted form in arabidopsis did not appear to be imported into either chloroplasts or mitochondria in vitro . the gdxn _GENE_ was clearly imported and cleaved in mitochondria in a valinomycin sensitive manner but was not imported into chloroplasts . additionally we have also conducted in vivo subcellular localization experiments using full length _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and gdxn fused to green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ . constructs were introduced by biolistic transformation into non green plant cell cultures and _METHOD_ observed . non green cultures were used as green plant material yields high chloroplast _METHOD_ and chloroplast targeted proteins were likely to obscure subtle co targeting to mitochondria . we used the soybean _PROTEIN_ presequence fused to _METHOD_ as a mitochondrial control and arabidopsis fused to _METHOD_ as a _LOCATION_ control . the _PROTEIN_ control produced the expected pattern for mitochondria reticulate punctate spots less than in size . the control produced a _LOCATION_ pattern of oval and rounded shapes of in diameter . fusion of the full length protein for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and gdxn to _METHOD_ all produced patterns that indicated mitochondrial targeting . however only _PROTEIN_ displayed a pattern that also indicated _LOCATION_ targeting . thus under the conditions used we could definitely confirm a mitochondrial location for all four proteins using _METHOD_ as a marker for in vivo subcellular localization . transcript abundances and gene of transcript abundance in leaves and roots revealed that all five asc glutathione cycle genes were _PROTEIN_ well in both tissue types . in contrast _LOCATION_ encoded ribosomal transcripts for the _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ dominated in leaves while transcripts for the _LOCATION_ encoded mitochondrial _PROTEIN_ were more evenly distributed . these data provide further evidence that this set of organellar targeting gene products are unlikely to be destined for photosynthetic roles in leaf tissue alone but rather are being synthesized in both root and shoot tissue consistent with a dual location in chloroplasts and mitochondria . further assessment of gene _PROTEIN_ was undertaken during oxidative stress treatments . a wide variety of stress conditions and photosynthetic operation are known to induce transcripts of the _LOCATION_ and chloroplast enzymes of the asc glutathione cycle in plants . when we recorded transcript abundances in light grown and dark _PROTEIN_ leaves a fold increase in the light in of transcripts was revealed . notably gdxn the only transcript not considered to be multitargeted is the only transcript that does not respond to light/dark changes . transcript changes induced by specific chemical stresses in lighted leaves were then assessed . norflurazon and paraquat are both capable of inducing chloroplast oxidative stress by inhibiting carotenoid synthesis and by acting as an artificial electron acceptor from photosystem i respectively . menadione leads to oxygen activation and lipid peroxidation generally in _LOCATION_ of the cell acting as a quinone like analogue in one electron donation reactions . antimycin a is a specific inhibitor of complex iii in the inner mitochondrial _LOCATION_ and induces superoxide formation from a highly reduced ubiquinone pool in vitro and in vivo . the significant transcript fold changes induced by treatments reveal that both _LOCATION_ and mitochondrial targeted stresses induce the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and dhar/gdxn transcripts . apx was not readily inducible by chemical stresses . overall norflurazon and menadione yielded a _PROTEIN_ response peaking > h while antimycin a and paraquat yielded more rapid changes in transcript abundance . however even within a stress some transcript responses were rapid and had abated to near control levels by h _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ while other transcripts were still increasing at h . this complexity of response magnitude and timing hints at further levels of control on this antioxidant cycle but its dual response to functional stresses emanating from the two organelles reveals a coordination of response consistent with transcriptional regulation of this gene set .
