bacterial pathogens of plant and animals share a homologous group of virulence _PROTEIN_ referred to as the yopj effector family which are translocated by the type iii secretion system into host cells during infection . recent work indicates that some of these effectors encode acetyltransferases that suppress host immunity . the yopj like protein avrbst is known to activate effector triggered immunity in arabidopsis thaliana pi plants however the nature of its enzymatic activity and host target has remained elusive . here we report that avrbst possesses acetyltransferase activity and acetylates an unknown protein from arabidopsis . genetic studies revealed that arabidopsis acip family members are required for both pathogen associated molecular pattern _PROTEIN_ triggered immunity and avrbst triggered eti during pseudomonas syringae pathovar tomato infection . microscopy studies revealed that is associated with punctae on the cell cortex and some of these punctae co localize with microtubules . these structures were dramatically altered during infection . pst or pst infection triggered the formation of numerous small punctae and rods . by contrast pst avrbst infection primarily triggered the formation of large _METHOD_ aggregates in an acetyltransferase dependent manner . our data reveal that members of the acip family are new components of the defense machinery required for anti bacterial immunity . they also suggest that avrbst dependent acetylation in planta alters 's defense function which is linked to the activation of eti .
to identify potential avrbst interacting proteins in arabidopsis we performed a yeast two hybrid screen using the dna binding domain fused to avrbst and an arabidopsis cdna library fused to the activation domain . we screened million primary yeast transformants and isolated independent clones with a candidate cdna encoded by . given that avrbst is predicted to encode an acetyltransferase we named the encoded protein for putative acetylated interacting protein . yeast two hybrid assay showing avrbst binding to arabidopsis . yeast strain carrying or were independently transformed with the or containing . contains the dna binding domain and contains the activation domain . strains were spotted on nonselective and selective _PROTEIN_ media and then incubated at for d. _PROTEIN_ avrbst affinity purification of in vitro . _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ avrbst was incubated with e. coli extracts containing . proteins were purified by using glutathione sepharose and analyzed by immunoblot analysis using anti _PROTEIN_ and anti his sera . protein input is shown on left and pull down on right . expected protein mw _PROTEIN_ kda _PROTEIN_ avrbst kda and kda . protein _PROTEIN_ vector control . _PROTEIN_ molecular weight standard . similar phenotypes were observed in at least independent experiments . is predicted to encode a protein with amino acids and molecular weight of kda . 's only distinguishing feature is that it is predicted to be a small helical protein that contains the widely conserved domain of unknown function _PROTEIN_ . it was first identified as a tubulin binding protein . belongs to a small arabidopsis protein family containing six acip like _METHOD_ . acip and its wheat ortholog tasrg are required for salt tolerance although their biochemical function are not known . shares identity and similarity with acip the closest isoform . a tree for the arabidopsis acip protein family is shown in . none of the acip like _METHOD_ were isolated in the primary avrbst interaction screen . a candidate yeast interaction screen comparing avrbst binding to or the six acip like _METHOD_ revealed that avrbst strongly interacts with but only weakly interacts with acip on selection media containing mm _PROTEIN_ . in the presence of mm _PROTEIN_ avrbst only interacted with . taken together these data suggest that avrbst preferentially binds to in yeast . next we used _PROTEIN_ pull down assays to independently monitor the physical association of avrbst and in vitro . recombinant _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ avrbst were _PROTEIN_ in e. coli and then purified using glutathione sepharose . purified _PROTEIN_ avrbst migrated as a doublet in protein gels suggesting that proteolysis of the full length polypeptide likely occurred during extraction and/or affinity purification . his tagged was _PROTEIN_ in e. coli and soluble protein extracts were incubated with the _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ avrbst in a standard _PROTEIN_ pull down assay . was affinity purified by _PROTEIN_ avrbst but not _PROTEIN_ . these findings are in agreement with the yeast two hybrid data and provide additional evidence that avrbst interacts with arabidopsis . we attempted to verify avrbst physical interaction in planta however the assays were not successful . transient or inducible _PROTEIN_ of avrbst in arabidopsis pi leaves or nicotiana benthamiana leaves results in localized cell death . it was difficult to obtain reproducible conclusive binding data under these cellular conditions . avrbst belongs to the yopj family of effector proteins some of which have been shown to exhibit acetyltransferase activity . to ascertain if avrbst acetylates we first sought to determine if avrbst possesses auto acetylation activity in vitro . recombinant wild type _PROTEIN_ avrbst _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were over _PROTEIN_ in e. coli and then purified using glutathione sepharose . purified proteins were incubated with acetyl coenzyme a nm inositol hexakisphosphate for minutes at room temperature and then separated by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ analysis followed by autoradiography . is a eukaryotic cofactor that stimulates the acetyltransferase activity of effectors in the yopj family . auto acetylation of _PROTEIN_ avrbst was detected in the presence of but not its absence . as expected similar dependent activation and auto acetylation of _PROTEIN_ was observed and _PROTEIN_ was not modified . mutation of the conserved catalytic cys residue _PROTEIN_ or his residue to ala inactivated avrbst dependent acetyltransferase activity but did not affect protein _PROTEIN_ levels . by contrast mutation of the conserved lys residue to arg which has been shown to be an auto acetylation site for some effectors in the yopj family did not affect avrbst 's acetylation state or protein accumulation . the auto acetylation activity of _PROTEIN_ avrbst was comparable to that of wild type _PROTEIN_ avrbst in reactions with varying concentrations of enzyme . all _PROTEIN_ avrbst protein analyzed migrated as a doublet and both of these species were auto acetylated . taken together these data indicate that avrbst possesses auto acetylation activity in vitro that is dependent on the conserved catalytic residues and _PROTEIN_ but this activity is independent of . avrbst auto acetylation activity in vitro . acetylation reactions using _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ avrbst _PROTEIN_ proteins . avrbst trans acetylates in vitro . acetylation reactions using _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ avrbst _PROTEIN_ avrbst _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ avrbt or _PROTEIN_ avrbst . substrate specificity of avrbst and . acetylation reactions using _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ avrbst . for acetylation reactions proteins were incubated with acetyl coa and nm inositol hexakisphosphate for min at rt . proteins were then separated by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . gels were stained with _METHOD_ and then analyzed by autoradiography . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were used as negative and positive acetyltransferase enzyme controls respectively . acetylated proteins _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ are labeled in the autoradiograph . _PROTEIN_ molecular weight standard in kda . _PROTEIN_ kda _PROTEIN_ kda _PROTEIN_ avrbst kda _PROTEIN_ kda . similar results were obtained in three independent experiments . next we tested if avrbst directly acetylates using similar reaction conditions to those described above . wild type _PROTEIN_ avrbst activity resulted in auto acetylation of the enzyme and trans acetylation of _PROTEIN_ whereas the catalytic core mutants _PROTEIN_ avrbst _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ avrbst exhibited neither activities . although the _PROTEIN_ avrbst mutant possessed auto acetylation activity trans acetylation of was not detected under the same reaction conditions . importantly mutation of _PROTEIN_ or did not disrupt avrbst binding to in vitro . to gain insight to the specificity of acetyltransferases in the yopj effector family we determined if could acetylate avrbst 's substrate . conversely we determined if avrbst could acetylate 's substrate tubulin . incubation of _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ did not result in detectable acetylation of . moreover neither nor other members of the hopz family could physically associate with in targeted yeast two hybrid screens . similarly we could not detect avrbst dependent acetylation of tubulin in vitro or direct physical interaction between avrbst and tubulin in yeast . these data suggest that avrbst and possess distinct substrate specificity . we assessed the biological activity of the avrbst mutant in arabidopsis pi leaves given that mutation of the analogous lys residue in and inhibits effector auto acetylation activity and effector dependent phenotypes in planta . bacterial growth curve analyses showed that the mutation attenuated the ability of avrbst to activate defense in pi similar to that observed for the mutation in the catalytic core . furthermore pst _PROTEIN_ avrbst did not elicit hr in pi leaves despite stable protein _PROTEIN_ . these data indicate that the mutation affects avrbst 's trans acetylation activity in vitro and its defense eliciting activity in planta . moreover these data indicate that the auto acetylation activity of avrbst is not sufficient to activate eti in arabidopsis . growth of pst in arabidopsis pi leaves . leaves were syringe infiltrated with a cells/ml suspension of bacteria pst carrying vector avrbst avrbst or avrbst . titers were assessed at and days post inoculation . data are mean sd . asterisks indicate statistically significant differences from pi . similar results were obtained in three independent experiments . hr phenotypes in pi leaves . leaves were infiltrated with a cells/ml suspension of pst carrying vector avrbst or avrbst . photograph was taken at hours post inoculation . number of leaves exhibiting confluent hr at hpi out of inoculated leaves is shown at bottom . given that nothing was known about function we first sought to elucidate its potential role in immunity . previously we showed that the pi ecotype of arabidopsis is resistant to pst _PROTEIN_ avrbst whereas the col ecotype is susceptible . interestingly mrna abundance was significantly reduced at and hpi in pi and col leaves inoculated with a cells/ml suspension of pst or pst avrbst compared to leaves inoculated with mock solution of mm . by contrast endogenous protein levels appeared to remain constant . these data suggest that may be transcriptionally or post transcriptionally regulated during pathogen attack and potentially linked to _PROTEIN_ and/or eti . to explore this further we first analyzed the growth of virulent pst in a homozygous col null mutant to determine if is required to limit pathogen growth . pst grew equally well in wild type col and mutant leaves . similar results were observed when the null allele was crossed into the pi background . we speculated that the lack of a bacterial growth phenotype in the col and pi mutants may be due to genetic redundancy since belongs to a small gene family in arabidopsis . since the nucleotide sequences between and acip like genes are highly conserved we engineered rnai lines to target multiple acip family members in attempt to uncover an immune phenotype linked to this gene family . notably we silenced the acip gene family in the pi background to be able to monitor both _PROTEIN_ and eti considering that avrbst induces eti in the pi ecotype but not the col ecotype . a bp hairpin acip binary construct was designed using the gene which included the most conserved region shared by the entire gene family and then it was transformed into pi plants . five independent transgenic rnai lines were characterized . the hp acip construct significantly reduced the mrna levels for of the family members in two acip rnai lines . of these genes mrna was the most abundant transcript in week old pi leaves suggesting that it may be the major isoform _PROTEIN_ in leaves . to monitor protein _PROTEIN_ in leaves we generated rabbit polyclonal antisera using recombinant protein purified from e. coli . the resulting antisera recognized multiple recombinant purified acip _METHOD_ with distinct molecular weights by immunoblot analysis . however in wild type pi leaf extracts the antisera only detected a single kda protein band . three of the _METHOD_ have predicted molecular weights in this range kda acip kda and acip kda . the kda protein band was not detected in the two acip rnai lines suggesting that acip and/or acip protein accumulation was significantly reduced . increased growth of pst and pst avrbst in pi acip rnai line and line compared to wild type pi . leaves were syringe infiltrated with a cells/ml suspension of bacteria . titers were assessed at and days post inoculation . data are mean sd . asterisks indicate statistically significant differences from pi . experiment was repeated three times with similar results . inset immunoblot analysis of protein extracted from pi and pi acip rnai leaves using anti sera . black dot non specific band arrowhead detected kda protein band expected to correspond to acip and/or acip . _PROTEIN_ molecular weight standard in kda . ponceau s stained rubisco large subunit was used as loading control . avrbst elicited hr phenotype in pi and pi acip rnai lines . leaves were infiltrated with a cells/ml suspension of pst alone or pst avrbst . photograph was taken at hours post inoculation . number of leaves exhibiting confluent hr at hpi out of inoculated leaves is shown at right . quantification of electrolyte leakage in the leaves described in at hpi . _LOCATION_ bars represent sd . asterisks indicate statistically significant differences from pi . experiment was repeated three times with similar results . bacterial growth curves were then performed using a cells/ml suspension of pst _PROTEIN_ avrbst and the two pi acip rnai transgenic lines to determine if acip _PROTEIN_ is required for avrbst triggered eti . the phenotypes of the acip silenced lines were compared with an unsilenced pi control plant . we found that the titer of pst avrbst was significantly higher in infected pi acip rnai leaves compared to that in wild type pi leaves . notably the pi acip rnai leaves were also more susceptible to pst . these data suggested that the silenced acip _METHOD_ might function in _PROTEIN_ as well as eti . to confirm that avrbst triggered eti is impaired in the rnai lines we performed hr and electrolyte leakage assays in leaves _PROTEIN_ with a high titer of pst avrbst . eti in the pi acip rnai lines was delayed but not fully inhibited . in control pi leaves avrbst dependent hr was visible at hpi in many leaves and by hpi leaves exhibited hr . by contrast hr was not observed in similarly inoculated rnai leaves at hpi however hr started to develop at hpi in leaves for line and leaves for line . consistent with these findings electrolyte leakage was significantly reduced in the pst avrbst inoculated pi acip rnai leaves relative to the inoculated pi leaves at hpi . these data suggest that multiple acip _METHOD_ are required for avrbst triggered eti _METHOD_ in pi . the pi acip rnai lines were also examined for their ability to mount eti in response to two other pseudomonas effectors avrb and . as observed for avrbst hr symptom development was slower in the rnai lines infected with a high titer of pst avrb or pst . subsequent bacterial growth curve analyses revealed that the pi acip rnai lines were more susceptible to both pst avrb and pst . these data suggest that the acip _METHOD_ play a general role in eti and are not specific to defense responses elicited by avrbst . given that the rnai lines were also more susceptible to pst we next examined the potential role of the acip family in _PROTEIN_ . first we analyzed the responsiveness of the pi acip rnai lines to the _PROTEIN_ elicitor . perception of by the prr _PROTEIN_ results in the production of reactive oxygen species one the first measurable _PROTEIN_ responses followed by changes in _PROTEIN_ gene induction . induced ros production was significantly reduced in both pi acip rnai lines . similarly induced mrna accumulation for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ two genes encoding transcription _PROTEIN_ that positively regulate _PROTEIN_ was significantly reduced at hr post treatment in both pi acip rnai lines . consistently the rnai line exhibited the least responsiveness to elicitation . stimulated oxidative burst response in pi and pi acip rnai leaves . rlu relative luminescence unit . _LOCATION_ bars represent sd . response in both rnai lines was significantly different from that in pi between time interval minutes . stimulated _PROTEIN_ marker gene induction in pi and pi acip rnai leaves . leaves of three plants were infiltrated with water or nm and then pooled for rna extraction . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mrna levels were quantified by qpcr . _PROTEIN_ was used to normalize the _PROTEIN_ value for each sample . relative _PROTEIN_ is shown . growth of pst in pi and pi acip rnai leaves . leaves were inoculated with a cells/ml suspension of bacteria . titers were assessed at and dpi . data are mean sd . pst stimulated _PROTEIN_ marker gene induction in pi and pi acip rnai lines . leaves were infiltrated with a cells/ml suspension of pst pst or mm . samples were collected at hpi and then analyzed as described in . asterisks indicate statistically significant differences from pi . similar results were obtained in three independent experiments for and two independent experiments for . we also examined the responsiveness of the pi acip rnai lines to pst a pseudomonas strain known to elicit _PROTEIN_ . pst lacks a functional apparatus and does not suppress _PROTEIN_ because effectors are not secreted . leaves were infected with a cells/ml suspension of bacteria and titers were determined at dpi . pi acip rnai leaves were significantly more susceptible to pst . consistent with these findings accumulation of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mrna was significantly reduced at hpi in pi acip rnai leaves compared to wild type pi leaves inoculated with a high titer of pst . taken together these data suggest that a subset of the acip family collectively contribute to anti bacterial immunity in arabidopsis . to begin to address 's function we examined protein localization in arabidopsis seedlings and mature plants . we generated homozygous transgenic pi plants _PROTEIN_ a _METHOD_ protein fusion under the control of the native promoter _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . using confocal microscopy we observed a low level of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ in day old etiolated seedlings and juvenile leaves . little or no detectable _METHOD_ was observed in mature senescing leaves . in hypocotyl epidermal cells _METHOD_ was predominantly found as punctae at the cell cortex . a portion of these punctae was aligned forming transverse cable like structures . 's subcellular localization pattern partially resembled that of cytoskeletal structures . unlike tasrg the acip ortholog _METHOD_ was not observed in the plant _LOCATION_ indicating that localization is distinct from this predicted transcription _PROTEIN_ . single plane images of periclinal surface of epidermal cells of day old etiolated pi _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ mcherry _PROTEIN_ hypocotyl cells . arrowheads show _METHOD_ punctae that are not associated with microtubules . localization of _METHOD_ in day old etiolated pi _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ hypocotyls treated with meoh or meoh oryzalin or _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ latrunculin b . cells were imaged using confocal microscopy . bars . next we applied drugs to disrupt the _LOCATION_ to determine if co localizes with actin and/or microtubules . treatment of the pi _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ seedlings with oryzalin a microtubule depolymerizing agent disrupted the _METHOD_ cable like structures and caused the formation of numerous _METHOD_ punctae throughout the cell . by contrast the actin depolymerizing agent latrunculin b did not appear to significantly disrupt these cables . to show acip co localization with microtubules we transformed the pi _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ lines with mcherry _PROTEIN_ a _METHOD_ tagged isoform of tubulin . a large portion of the _METHOD_ punctae co localized with mcherry _PROTEIN_ microtubules . some of the cortical _METHOD_ punctae were not associated with microtubules . inspection of the literature revealed that was identified in the arabidopsis proteome that co purified with tubulin by affinity chromatography . we did not detect a direct interaction between and _PROTEIN_ in a targeted yeast two hybrid assay . it is possible that association with tubulin might be indirect or via a weak electrostatic interaction . or might interact with another isoform of tubulin . collectively our findings indicate that _METHOD_ signal _METHOD_ punctae on the cell cortex and some of these punctae co localize with the cortical microtubule network . we speculated that avrbst binding to and acetylation of might interfere with 's stability and/or localization within plant leaves during pathogen infection . we did not detect by protein gel blot analysis any differences in endogenous protein abundance or mobility using extracts isolated from pi leaves infected with pst or pst avrbst . however we did notice that _METHOD_ localization in week old pi _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ leaves was dramatically altered in response to both pst and pst avrbst . unlike the signal in young hypocotyls _METHOD_ _METHOD_ at the cortex of epidermal cells in week old leaves inoculated with the mm mock control was diffuse and faint . this signal was difficult to capture in the image projection and varied among plants . by contrast _METHOD_ punctae were observed at or near the cell periphery of these cells . infection with pst for h led to the formation of rod shaped _METHOD_ structures of various lengths which were difficult to detect in the mm mock control . the _METHOD_ rods were also detected in response to pst indicating that these structures are associated with _PROTEIN_ in a effector independent manner . strikingly pst avrbst infection for h led to the formation of large bright _METHOD_ aggregates and fewer rod like structures . this localization pattern was dependent on avrbst 's catalytic activity . pst avrbst infection resulted in a _METHOD_ signal similar to that induced by pst alone . similarly pst avrbst infection led to the formation of _METHOD_ rods but not large aggregates . pi _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ leaves were inoculated with mm or a cells/ml suspension of pst vector pst pst avrbst pst avrbst pst avrbst or pst . spinning disk confocal images were recorded at hpi . bar . similar results were obtained in more than independent experiments . to determine if _METHOD_ aggregates are generated specifically by avrbst and/or in response to _PROTEIN_ production we tested the phenotype of pst . elicits eti in pi leaves which is dependent on _PROTEIN_ production . infection with pst induced the formation of _METHOD_ rods similar to those formed in response to pst alone pst avrbst and pst avrbst . however aggregates were not observed in response to pst . pi _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ leaves were inoculated with _PROTEIN_ and then imaged the leaves hr _PROTEIN_ . exogenous _PROTEIN_ triggered the formation of several _METHOD_ rods but only a few punctae whereas the mock control containing _METHOD_ did not . these data suggest that _PROTEIN_ exposure is sufficient to promote the formation of punctae and rods but not the formation of aggregates . moreover they indicate that aggregate formation is a specific phenotype linked to avrbst acetyltransferase activity in planta .
