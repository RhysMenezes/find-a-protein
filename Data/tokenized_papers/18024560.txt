calcium and manganese are essential nutrients required for normal plant growth and development and transport processes play a key role in regulating their cellular levels . arabidopsis contains four type _PROTEIN_ genes _PROTEIN_ to _PROTEIN_ which are _PROTEIN_ in all major organs of arabidopsis . to elucidate the physiological role of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis several independent t dna insertion mutant alleles were isolated . when grown on medium lacking mn _PROTEIN_ mutants but not _PROTEIN_ mutants displayed a striking difference from wild type plants . after approximately to d on this medium _PROTEIN_ mutants became chlorotic and root and shoot growth were strongly inhibited compared to wild type plants . these severe deficiency _METHOD_ were suppressed by low levels of mn indicating a crucial role for _PROTEIN_ in mn nutrition in arabidopsis . _PROTEIN_ mutants were also more sensitive than wild type plants and _PROTEIN_ mutants on medium lacking ca however the differences were not so striking because in this case all plants were severely affected . _PROTEIN_ partially restored the growth defect on high mn of the yeast mutant which is defective in a _LOCATION_ ca/mn pump and the yeast mutant defective in _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ ca/mn pumps . _PROTEIN_ also rescued the growth defect of on low ca . promoter _PROTEIN_ studies show that _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ in a range of tissues and cells including primary root tips root vascular tissue hydathodes and guard cells . when transiently _PROTEIN_ in nicotiana tabacum an _PROTEIN_ yellow _METHOD_ protein fusion protein showed overlapping _PROTEIN_ with the _LOCATION_ protein _PROTEIN_ . we propose that _PROTEIN_ is important for mn and ca homeostasis possibly functioning in the transport of these ions into the _LOCATION_ . _PROTEIN_ is the first p type _PROTEIN_ to be identified in plants that is required under mn deficient conditions .
_PROTEIN_ from ecotype columbia contains an open reading frame of amino acids with a predicted molecular _METHOD_ of kd . it is identical to the sequence predicted from genome sequencing but differs from the _PROTEIN_ sequence that we cloned previously from landsberg _LOCATION_ in four bases and _PROTEIN_ . in the _PROTEIN_ sequence from landsberg _LOCATION_ the second and fourth base changes are silent but the first and third give changes in the amino acid sequence and . conpred ii a consensus prediction method for obtaining transmembrane topology models indicates that _PROTEIN_ contains tm domains a small cytoplasmic loop between _METHOD_ and and a large cytoplasmic loop between _METHOD_ and . the latter contains the highly conserved phosphorylation domain csdktgtlt which includes the phosphorylated asp residue _PROTEIN_ that is phosphorylated during the reaction cycle in all p type _PROTEIN_ . this model is consistent with structural models that have been presented for the sarcoplasmic _LOCATION_ ca _PROTEIN_ from animal cells . to determine the physiological function of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ we obtained mutant lines in which _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were likely to be functionally disrupted . we isolated two independent mutant alleles for each _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . these t dna insertion alleles were identified using the reverse genetics approach outlined in materials and methods. figure illustrates genotyping of plants from the salk line figure shows that for each particular mutant no product with the appropriate gene specific primers could be detected in reverse transcribed cdna from plants homozygous for the insert . figure and table i summarize the t dna insertion positions in the resulting mutant alleles and indicate where in the protein the insertion would occur . the position of the inserts in each of the mutants means that these are predicted loss of function mutants . eca mutant alleles identified in this study introns and exons are numbered so that the first exon begins with the start _PROTEIN_ and is followed by the first intron . to elucidate the biological function of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis we monitored insertion mutants under a wide range of conditions comparing their growth and development to wild type plants . when grown on soil no major differences from wild type plants were observed . because _PROTEIN_ mutants were previously shown to be extremely retarded when grown on low ca medium _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants were tested in this range . at basal levels of ca _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants were similar in their fresh weight and chlorophyll content to wild type plants results are shown only for fresh weight for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . in contrast to results reported previously for _PROTEIN_ mutants _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants were no more retarded in growth than wild type plants at low ca . we next tested whether there was a difference in the growth of the mutants when ca was omitted from the medium . under these conditions both wild type and mutant seedlings were adversely affected . they became chlorotic and stopped growing at an early stage . in general both _PROTEIN_ mutants were slightly more sensitive than wild type and _PROTEIN_ mutants but in this experiment only _PROTEIN_ was significantly lower in fresh weight . _PROTEIN_ mutants were previously shown to be more adversely affected in growth on high mn medium . we found no difference in the response of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants to this level of mn compared to wild type plants . therefore we investigated whether the mutants showed any responses under mn deficient conditions . a striking difference was observed in the _PROTEIN_ mutants compared to _PROTEIN_ and wild type when grown on medium with mn omitted . under these conditions _PROTEIN_ mutants showed a marked reduction in growth which first became apparent after approximately to d. both root and shoot growth were reduced . in addition the cotyledons became yellow and the marked reduction in chlorophyll is indicated in figure . there were some interesting features observed when individual seedlings were examined closely . in some seedlings dark areas were seen at the tips of developing leaves . on leaves where the lamina was expanding a brown band was often observed across the petiole or lamina with bleaching occurring distal to the band . in many cases the leaf lamina failed to expand further and senescing areas were observed . when leaves did develop these and the expanded cotyledons were seen to bleach . addition of mn to the medium at a concentration of around was sufficient to suppress these phenotypes . the response of arabidopsis mutants to other ion deficiencies was also investigated . when zn was omitted from the growth medium there was no significant difference in the performance of the _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ mutants compared to wild type . _PROTEIN_ mutants were inhibited in their growth to the same extent as wild type and there were no significant differences in _METHOD_ of fresh weight of shoot or chlorophyll content . omission of iron from the medium had a marked effect on growth and chlorophyll content of all plants but there was no specific detrimental effect on the mutants compared to wild type plants . omitting copper from the medium also had no specific effect on mutants compared to wild type . because the _PROTEIN_ mutants showed a clear phenotype under mn deficient conditions mn content was determined under nutrient sufficient and mn deficient conditions . the levels observed in each genotype are shown in figure . to make this clearer the level relative to the wild type _PROTEIN_ is shown in supplemental figure with the level in the wild type indicated as a dashed line . despite the marked differences observed in the growth phenotype of _PROTEIN_ mutants compared to wild type plants when grown under mn deficient conditions there were no major differences in metal content changes when _PROTEIN_ mutants and wild type plants were compared . generally mn content of _PROTEIN_ mutants was slightly lower than wild type plants under both conditions . ca content was slightly higher under both conditions in the _PROTEIN_ mutants compared to wild type plants and zn was similar or slightly lower . again for both ca and zn there was little difference in the response to reducing the mn concentration in the medium of _PROTEIN_ mutants compared to wild type plants . we can not rule out that extended growth under mn deficient conditions could lead to metal content changes but we chose a point at which the _METHOD_ although apparent were not too severe . semiquantitative reverse transcription pcr was used to determine whether ecas were present in various organs of hydroponically grown arabidopsis . primers designed to regions of _PROTEIN_ to _PROTEIN_ amplified products of and bp respectively . amplification of a bp product with primers to the constitutively _PROTEIN_ ribosomal protein a component of the subunit was used as a control . transcripts for all ecas are present in all major organs . results for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are consistent with data from publicly available microarray studies which also show that these genes are _PROTEIN_ in all major organs . _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ can not be determined from microarray analysis because the probe sets are not distinct . to confirm these results and obtain further information about the tissue specific _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ within the different plant organs a gus reporter gene was cloned under the control of the promoter region for _PROTEIN_ . gus staining of seedlings showed high _PROTEIN_ levels in guard cells hydathodes and the vascular tissue in leaves . in primary roots high levels of _PROTEIN_ were seen at the root tip and vascular system . transverse sections of roots showed high gus activity in the stele particularly in pericycle and xylem parenchyma cells . staining was also observed in developing _PROTEIN_ roots and tip and vascular staining was seen in more mature _PROTEIN_ roots . strong staining was also found in different flower tissues including stamens _PROTEIN_ and sepals as well as in siliques . some metal transporters are regulated at the transcriptional level by the metals they transport . for example _PROTEIN_ a zn transporting _PROTEIN_ is up regulated by elevated levels of zn and the fe transporter _PROTEIN_ is up regulated under fe deficient conditions . others such as _PROTEIN_ show no obvious regulation by metals at the level of transcription . real time pcr was performed to determine whether _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ changed under conditions of metal deficiency . root and shoot _PROTEIN_ levels of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ relative to the component of ribosomal are shown for seedlings grown on basal medium or in the absence of either mn or zn . there were no significant differences in the _PROTEIN_ of either gene when grown under these conditions . for a comparison we measured _PROTEIN_ levels of the transporter _PROTEIN_ and in this case there was marked up regulation under zn deficient conditions as reported previously . to determine the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ fusions with yellow _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ were generated . transient _PROTEIN_ in tobacco epidermal cells followed by confocal laser scanning microscopy revealed small motile organelles characteristic of _LOCATION_ . there was a high level of colocalization with the _LOCATION_ protein _PROTEIN_ visualized using _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusions . heterologous _PROTEIN_ in yeast has been used in a number of studies to functionally characterize animal and plant transporters . the yeast mutant is defective in endogenous ca/mn pumps and has been very useful in functional analysis of plant ca pumps . growth of yeast is inhibited in the presence of elevated mn or zn in the medium . _PROTEIN_ rescues on high zn restoring growth almost to the level of control cells . _PROTEIN_ also partially restored growth of on elevated mn but not to the extent of the cells . increased sensitivity to elevated mn concentrations is also observed in the mutant and _PROTEIN_ reduced this growth defect compared to vector controls . vector transformants are also unable to grow on medium containing reduced levels of ca . _PROTEIN_ suppresses the egta sensitive phenotype allowing growth in the presence of egta to levels similar to those seen in the control strain .
seeds of wild type and transgenic arabidopsis were sterilized in bleach for min rinsed five times with sterile water and inoculated onto plates containing agarose suc and either one half strength murashige and skoog medium or the same medium but with ca levels reduced from mm to mm . for experiments investigating the effect of mn deficiency on phenotype mn was omitted from the murashige and skoog medium . seeds were stratified at for h prior to transfer to a controlled environment cabinet and plates were incubated vertically or horizontally as indicated . to examine the development of the plants to maturity seeds were sown in soil sterilized by autoclaving at for min at bar pressure and plants were grown in a controlled environment cabinet or under glasshouse conditions . to obtain organ material from mature plants for gene _PROTEIN_ analysis plants were grown hydroponically as described previously . fresh weight and chlorophyll measurements were determined using seedlings grown on five separate plates each plate having six wild type seedlings and six mutant seedlings . the data presented are generally the means from the five plates _PROTEIN_ on a per seedling basis . student

according to the manufacturer 's instructions with an oligo primer . the _PROTEIN_ pattern of _PROTEIN_ to _PROTEIN_ was determined by semiquantitative rt pcr using primers designed to specifically amplify parts of each sequence _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ forward primer _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ reverse primer ccaacgccgaggtaagtaac _PROTEIN_ reverse primer gcaaggatgagtaaagcaacaa _PROTEIN_ forward primer tagggacgaggaaaatgg and reverse primer _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ forward primer _PROTEIN_ and reverse primer gcctgtatttctagagagga . control pcr was performed using primers to ribosomal gene forward primer acgccatccgtcagagtatc and reverse primer cgccacaagcagagtcctat . products were amplified using biomix taq and cycles were chosen that were in the exponential phase of pcr amplification . primers were used at a final concentration of . pcr conditions were for min the required number of cycles of for s then _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or for min then for min . amplified dna was separated on agarose gels and visualized using ethidium bromide . a similar procedure was used for real time pcr but using superscript iii reverse transcriptase and oligo primers . the same primer pairs were used for and _PROTEIN_ and the primer pair taggaccatcgcgtttgagaac with tctccatggtggcatcgttaag was used for _PROTEIN_ . real time pcr reactions were performed in a well plate using a chromo thermal cycler with the opticon monitor iii program . sybr green was used to monitor cdna amplification . for data evaluation target gene _PROTEIN_ was normalized to reference gene _PROTEIN_ by an efficiency calibrated method using the equation where e is pcr efficiency and ct is the number of pcr cycles before the signal reaches the threshold level . _PROTEIN_ from arabidopsis columbia was cloned in two overlapping parts as initial attempts to amplify full length cdna failed . the part was amplified from clone obtained from kazusa dna research institute using the primers _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ primer introduced a bamhi site allowing the product to be cut with bamhi and at an ecori site within the _PROTEIN_ sequence for ligation into the same sites of giving _PROTEIN_ . the part of _PROTEIN_ was amplified from reverse transcribed rna from leaf tissue using the primers _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and cloned into pgemte . the primer _PROTEIN_ overlaps the end of the part and the _PROTEIN_ primer introduced a hindiii site allowing the _PROTEIN_ fragment to be excised with ecori and hindiii and ligated into the same sites of _PROTEIN_ to produce the full length _PROTEIN_ cdna in _PROTEIN_ . sequencing of the final product confirmed that the full length _PROTEIN_ was identical to the sequence predicted from genome sequencing . the genbank accession number for _PROTEIN_ cloned in this study is . gateway technology was used to produce the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ construct . _PROTEIN_ cdna was pcr amplified from the _PROTEIN_ construct and integrated into the pentr topo vector by topo cloning . _PROTEIN_ was then subcloned into the pearleygate destination vector which attaches _METHOD_ in frame to the n terminus of _PROTEIN_ . for tissue specific _PROTEIN_ studies kb of the untranslated region for _PROTEIN_ was amplified by high fidelity pcr with primers and _PROTEIN_ . the pcr product was cloned into pentr/d topo using gateway technology and transferred to plasmid to generate a construct containing the open reading frame for a gus reporter gene under the control of the _PROTEIN_ promoter region . the yeast strain was transformed with _PROTEIN_ or vector alone using a li acetate method based on citation . yeast transformants were selected on medium lacking uracil . yeast strain transformed with the empty vector was used as a positive control . to compare the growth of cells containing _PROTEIN_ or alone cells were first grown in liquid culture overnight at in synthetic complete without uracil and containing g glc as the _PROTEIN_ source . cultures were adjusted to the same and aliquots were inoculated onto agar plates containing the sc uracil medium with gal or glc and various additions as specified in results.

_METHOD_ transformed a. tumefaciens was cultured at until the stationary phase washed and resuspended in infiltration medium . the bacterial suspension was inoculated using a ml syringe without a needle by gentle pressure through the stomata on the lower epidermal surface . transformed plants were then incubated under normal growth conditions for d at . transformed leaves were analyzed h after infection of the lower epidermis . confocal imaging was performed using an inverted zeiss _PROTEIN_ meta laser scanning microscope with a oil immersion objective . for imaging _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ excitation lines of an argon ion laser of nm for _METHOD_ and nm for _METHOD_ with a nm band pass filter for _METHOD_ and a nm band pass filter for _METHOD_ were used alternately with line switching using the multitrack facilities of the microscope . appropriate controls were performed to exclude any cross talk and bleed through of _METHOD_ . a. tumefaciens strain was transformed by electroporation and transformants were selected on yep plates containing gentamycin and kanamycin . wild type arabidopsis ecotype columbia plants were transformed by floral dipping . seeds were
