encodes a large subunit _PROTEIN_ and affects ribosome biogenesis and auxin response and homeostasis .
because drought stress and phytohormone abscisic acid can inhibit _PROTEIN_ root development in arabidopsis this trait was used to screen for mutants potentially involved in the drought stress response . one mutant was isolated from an population generated by _METHOD_ mutagenized arabidopsis in the columbia glabrous background . this mutant is constitutively defective in _PROTEIN_ root growth _PROTEIN_ of the water potential or the aba level in the growth media . mutant seedlings grew slower than the wild type and had a slightly yellowish colour . in addition mutants had fewer emerging _PROTEIN_ roots and displayed a strong incurvature phenotype in young leaves . to map the mutation the mutant was crossed with landsberg _LOCATION_ . the mutation was initially mapped to a mbp region on chromosome between the simple sequence length polymorphic markers _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . whole genome dna sequencing of the mutant was subsequently conducted . in the mapping interval a g to a single nucleotide change was found in the gene which was predicted to generate a premature stop codon and would produce a truncated protein with amino acids instead of the intact amino acid length . structure of the gene and phylogenetic analysis of related proteins in arabidopsis . genomic dna structure of and the location of mutations . exons introns and are shown by black boxes bold lines and white boxes respectively . mutation sites are marked with arrows . phylogenetic tree of related proteins generated by dnaman software . to confirm that the phenotypes observed in the mutant can be attributed to the loss of function of the gene a t dna insertion allele in the col background was obtained . this mutant was described as . the progeny plants of and crosses showed the same phenotypes as and indicating that is responsible for the mutant phenotypes . yeasts and humans have only a single copy of their respective homologue which is essential for cell viability while arabidopsis has two homologues . encodes a protein that shares identity with at the protein sequence level . a blast search using as a query sequence also found two other circularly permuted _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ like _PROTEIN_ and _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ with only and identity with respectively . nevertheless the _PROTEIN_ domain region of these proteins is better conserved relative to the rest of the protein . previous studies showed that _PROTEIN_ is required for flower and leaf development and _PROTEIN_ is involved in pre ribosomal subunit maturation . the _PROTEIN_ rnai mutant has been shown to have increased sensitivity to cycloheximide treatment . although and mutants had identical morphological and developmental phenotypes because of the possibility of interference from the mutation on development and potential background mutations in the _METHOD_ mutagenized mutant the allele was used for the characterization of mutant phenotypes . phenotypes of the mutant . morphology of d old seedlings of col and growing on horizontally placed agar plates . scale bars . morphology of col and seedlings grown in soil . scale bars . phenotype of d old seedlings of col and growing on vertically placed agar plates . scale bars . transverse section of the fifth rosette leaf of col and . arrow indicates the region where extra cell division occurred . scale bars . venations of cotyledons and the first pair rosette leaves in col and . at least plants were examined and the representative images are shown . scale bars . the diameter of rosette leaves of week old plants growing in soil . primary root length of d old seedlings . the number of lrs at different developmental stages of d old seedlings . data are means standard _LOCATION_ . p < compared with wild type plants . mutant leaves emerged _PROTEIN_ and grew smaller than wild type leaves . prior to bolting mutants had significantly smaller stature than the wild type with markedly shorter primary roots and arrested _PROTEIN_ root growth . in d old seedlings lrs were visible on wild type plants but were barely visible in mutants . there are two possible explanations for _PROTEIN_ visible lrs in mutants either lr growth is not being initiated or fewer lrs are elongated . by measuring the lr density a higher density was found in the mutant indicating that fewer visible lrs in the mutant can not be explained by the failure of initiation . therefore lr number was examined at different developmental stages for which a previous study was followed lr development is divided into four stages . in stage a lrs are primordial with up to two cell layers in stage b lrs are between three cell layers and just prior to emergence in stage c lrs emerge but are shorter than and in stage d lrs are longer than . among these stages of lrs only stage d is visible to the naked eye . after examining lr number at all stages significantly fewer lrs were found at stage d in the mutant . thus the reduced _PROTEIN_ root phenotype in the early developmental stage of the mutant was a result of a delay in lr emergence . the most notable phenotype of mutants is the incurvature of rosette leaves . transverse thin sections were examined across the regions of fully expanded fifth leaves where the incurvature occurred and a significant increase in layers of spongy mesophyll cells was found in the abaxial side of mutant leaves suggesting that extra cell division in the abaxial side of leaves is _PROTEIN_ responsible for the incurvature . interestingly the leaf incurvature phenotype was _PROTEIN_ exhibited at the early stages of plant development . when the inflorescence emerged this incurvature phenotype could occasionally be seen in the newly emerged axillary leaves . on the other hand old rosette leaves and cauline leaves showed no sign of the incurvature phenotype . noticeably flatness of the cotyledon was not affected by deficiency . because vascular structure is closely related with leaf development the structure of the wild type and mutants was investigated . as shown in the vascular structure of cotyledons and the first pair of leaves in the mutant were very different from that of the wild type plant . vein loops were often open in the cotyledons of mutants while those of the wild type were typically closed . in the first pair of leaves the distal part of the midvein was bifurcated in the mutant unlike the wild type . furthermore the mutant had considerably fewer _PROTEIN_ and quaternary veins compared with the wild type . the _PROTEIN_ of and was examined using qrt pcr on rna extracted from different organs of wild type plants . was highly _PROTEIN_ in the flowers moderately _PROTEIN_ in the roots axillary leaves rosette leaves and siliques of young seedlings and marginally _PROTEIN_ in the stalks of inflorescence and cauline leaves . was highly _PROTEIN_ in siliques moderately _PROTEIN_ in roots the flowers and rosette leaves and marginally _PROTEIN_ in the stalks of inflorescence and cauline and axillary leaves of young seedlings . generally _PROTEIN_ levels of were notably higher than those of in all the organs examined . the _PROTEIN_ pattern of during plant development was further studied by using the promoter driven gus reporter gene . strong gus signals in the entire cotyledon and in emerging leaves were observed . strong signals were detected in all first pairs of leaves but only in the distal part and with a concave pattern in second leaves . the gus signal was highly _PROTEIN_ in the marginal region but minimally in the midvein region . this _PROTEIN_ pattern was further demonstrated by qrt pcr . in the primary root was specifically _PROTEIN_ in vascular bundles along elongation and differentiation zones . transverse section analysis showed that was _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in the stele but was excluded from the xylem . because prominent lr phenotypes were observed in mutants its _PROTEIN_ was investigated in detail . it was found that is strongly _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ root cells of all stages examined and in the inflorescence . in flowers higher _PROTEIN_ in filaments and sepals was observed . strong signals were detected at the junction between the silique and the pedicel while only low signals were detected at the tip of siliques . despite the high _PROTEIN_ level of in inflorescence or the silique no visible phenotype was observed in these organs probably because of the functional redundancy between and . thus it is evident that is highly _PROTEIN_ in newly emerged leaves leaf veins the vascular structure of the roots and _PROTEIN_ root primordia where auxin also accumulates . the _PROTEIN_ pattern of gus _PROTEIN_ was detected in and d old seedlings d old soil grown plant lrs at stage a c and d inflorescence and siliques . transverse section of gus stained primary roots . arrow indicates the xylem . ten gus positive transgenic plants were checked and similar _PROTEIN_ patterns were observed . a representative image is shown . scale bars and . previous studies have shown that proteins have different subcellular localization in yeast human and drosophila cells . to determine where they localize in plant cells _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ constructs were created and transformed into the protoplasts of wild type plants and and mutants . these constructs fully complemented the mutant phenotypes suggesting that they were fully functional . in transiently _PROTEIN_ protoplasts these proteins were localized in the _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ which is consistent with a recent study . in stably transformed plants the localization of _METHOD_ tagged proteins was examined in different organs including the cotyledon and the root elongation and division zones . surprisingly the localization of both and was limited to the _LOCATION_ in these organs . this is particularly evident in the root division zone where _METHOD_ signals were excluded from the hollow areas _LOCATION_ and were found in the cytoplasm . subcellular localization of and . the _METHOD_ signal was detected in the _LOCATION_ of cells in cotyledon root division zone root elongation zone and hypocotyl of plants transformed with _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ . arrows indicate _LOCATION_ . scale bars . at least transformed plants were examined . to investigate the impact of deficiency on ribosome biogenesis in plants ribosome levels were examined in d old mutant seedlings using ribosome profiling assays . the mutants were found to have _PROTEIN_ levels of and ribosomal subunits and monosomes although polysome production was not affected . thus is important for _PROTEIN_ normal and ribosome biogenesis and monosome assembly in plants . ribosome profiling analysis and deletion analyses . ribosome profiling analysis using d old seedlings of col and the mutant . this experiment was repeated twice with similar results . deletion analysis . various deletion fragments of used in yeast complementation assays are shown . empty vector _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and yeast were used as negative and positive controls respectively . at least three clones per construct were examined . the protein includes an n and a c terminus and a _PROTEIN_ domain . in a previous study certain regions were shown to be important for function in yeast for example the _PROTEIN_ motif is essential for _PROTEIN_ binding and a mutation in the predicted coil coil region affects yeast growth . to investigate which regions are important for function intact and a series of deletion constructs were made and these proteins were _PROTEIN_ in the yeast mutant . as shown in full length cdna from complemented the phenotype of the yeast mutant similar to results from a recent study . however neither truncated protein rescued the yeast mutant indicating that all the examined regions are essential for function in ribosome biogenesis . because is involved in ribosome biogenesis and mutants exhibited multiple developmental defects it was anticipated that there would be changes in the proteome of the mutants . to probe changes in the proteomic profile of mutants itraq analysis was used to compare the global protein profile of d old seedling roots of the wild type and the mutant . using a fold change greater than and p < as the criteria for significance proteins in total were found to be differentially regulated . among them were significantly up regulated and were down regulated in the mutant . a functional classification of differentially regulated proteins was made using the software david and it was found that the up regulated group was _PROTEIN_ associated with secondary metabolic process and in response to abiotic stimuli . the down regulated group was enriched in proteins involved in response to abiotic stimuli and water transport . interestingly the itraq analysis identified that proteins involved in ribosome biogenesis were differentially regulated which accounted for of total differentially regulated proteins in the mutant . among these five have higher _PROTEIN_ levels in the mutant . these included two _PROTEIN_ like pre mrna processing ribonucleoproteins _PROTEIN_ like _PROTEIN_ a ribosomal protein and _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ is involved in rrna processing ribosome biosynthesis and vascular pattern formation . all of the down regulated proteins are ribosomal proteins including seven and three ribosomal proteins . this is evidence that loss of function affects the level of proteins involved in ribosome biogenesis . it was also noted that most of the down regulated proteins involved in water transport are aquaporins . among the major aquaporin proteins in arabidopsis seven were simultaneously repressed in the mutant . notably aquaporin proteins are regulated by auxin and are involved in _PROTEIN_ root emergence . differentially regulated proteins involved in ribosome biogenesis in the mutant values are means of three technical replicates _PROTEIN_ in relative fold changes . functional classification of differentially _PROTEIN_ proteins in compared with wild type col . proteins in the up regulated and down regulated groups were classified by david software . the top functional annotations ordered by the enrichment scores are presented . two biological repeats and three technique repeats were performed for the itraq analysis . the mutants exhibited similar developmental defects as auxin related mutants such as abnormal vein structure in leaves and cotyledons short primary roots and delayed lr emergence . the gus reporter was employed to monitor the distribution of auxin in mutant leaves . the reporter gene was introduced into by genetic crossing and its _PROTEIN_ was examined . the gus staining pattern in the mutant was distinctly different from that in the wild type . high _PROTEIN_ of the gus reporter gene was observed in the leaf border of mutant leaves similar to npa treated seedlings . the accumulation of auxin or an increased auxin response may have triggered the extra cell division activity that was observed in the abaxial side of mutant leaves causing the leaf incurvature phenotype in mutants . auxin distribution in mutant leaves and auxin responses of the mutant . cotyledon phenotype of wild type seedlings grown on _METHOD_ medium without or with npa . gus _PROTEIN_ in the cotyledons of npa untreated and treated wild type seedlings . gus _PROTEIN_ in the whole plant of col and . arrows indicate first leaves . close up view of gus _PROTEIN_ in the first leaf of col and . auxin response of the mutant . five day old seedlings grown on half strength _METHOD_ medium were transferred to media supplemented with the indicated concentrations of auxins and grown for an additional d. primary root length was then measured and _PROTEIN_ relative to that under auxin free conditions . data are means standard _LOCATION_ . reduced levels of auxin induced genes in the mutant as revealed by qrt pcr analysis . p < p < compared with wild type plants . scale bars and . the sensitivity of mutants to auxin treatments was investigated . primary root growth of the wild type and the mutant was examined with seedlings growing on _METHOD_ medium containing either iaa dichlorophenoxyacetic acid or naphthaleneacetic acid . auxin influx carriers mediate the influx of exogenous iaa and d into the roots whereas naa can freely penetrate into the cells in a carrier independent manner . as shown in the mutant consistently exhibited reduced sensitivity to these auxins . next the response of to auxin was examined in _METHOD_ of auxin inducible gene _PROTEIN_ . six day old wild type and seedlings were treated with iaa for and the _PROTEIN_ levels of several auxin responsive genes were analysed using qrt pcr . although the _PROTEIN_ levels of most genes were induced to various extents by auxin they were induced to a lesser extent in the mutant than in the wild type . the movement of auxin within plants is mediated by a group of transporters . thus it was examined whether the _PROTEIN_ of auxin transporters was affected in the mutant . the _METHOD_ tagged auxin efflux carriers _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and the auxin influx carrier _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were introduced into the mutant by genetic crossing . it was found that the _PROTEIN_ levels of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were significantly lower in mutants compared with those in the wild type . using gus as a reporter auxin transport between the wild type and mutants was compared . after root tips were treated with iaa for gus signals became easily visible in the upper part of the wild type but not in mutant roots . after an additional more signals were detected in the upper part of the wild type root but only faint signals were detected in mutant roots . these data indicated that auxin transport was also impaired in the mutants . the mutant has reduced levels of auxin transporters and displays auxin transport defects . _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in roots of col and and quantification of the _METHOD_ intensity . for each genotype

similar results . representative images are shown . and have a high degree of amino acid identity and also share overlapping gene _PROTEIN_ patterns . the relatively mild phenotypes of mutants suggest that might partly compensate for the loss of . the _PROTEIN_ level of was examined in the leaves of knockout line by qrt pcr and was found markedly increased in . next the _PROTEIN_ levels of in cosuppression lines that were transformed with the overexpression construct were investigated yet showed phenotypes similar to those of mutants likely due to silencing of the endogenous gene . in these plants the total _PROTEIN_ level of from both the endogenous gene and the transgene was significantly higher but the _PROTEIN_ level of endogenous was greatly _PROTEIN_ . in contrast the _PROTEIN_ level of in these plants increased consistent with the notion that loss of function could induce increased _PROTEIN_ of . _PROTEIN_ levels of and in the wild type and cosuppression plants .

the arabidopsis mutant was isolated for its reduced _PROTEIN_ root growth from an population generated by ethyl methane sulphonate _METHOD_ mutagenized arabidopsis in the columbia glabrous background . seeds of t dna insertion lines and auxin transporter _METHOD_ reporter lines were obtained from the arabidopsis biological resource center . seeds were surface sterilized with a bleach solution for washed with water five times and then planted on half strength murashige and skoog _METHOD_ agar medium plates . the plates were kept at in darkness for d and then moved to a growth chamber at under a photoperiod of light and darkness or a photoperiod of light and darkness . for morphological and histological analyses seedlings were transferred to soil in a growth room under the same growth conditions as in the growth chamber . to generate the gus fusion construct a promoter fragment from genomic dna was amplified by pcr and first cloned into the pentrtm/d topo vector and subsequently cloned into the upstream of gus in using _PROTEIN_ technology . to construct _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ the full length coding region was cloned into the pentrtm/d topo vector and then into vectors pearlygate or pearlygate respectively to produce _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ . using the same method was cloned into the pearlygate vector to construct _METHOD_ . information on primers used in this study is given in supplementary table available at jxb online . transgenic plants were generated by transferring plasmids into arabidopsis via the agrobacterium mediated flower dipping method . protoplasts were prepared from fully expanded healthy leaves of week old plants . arabidopsis protoplast transformation was performed as previously described . total rna was extracted from plant materials using an rneasy mini kit . dna was eliminated from total rna using dnase i and cleaned with the rneasy mini kit . cleaned rna was reverse transcribed using the superscript reverse iii reagent according to the manufacturer s instructions . two _METHOD_ of rna were used for quantitative real time pcr analysis . qrt pcr was performed on a fast real time pcr system _METHOD_ using sybr green pcr master mix _METHOD_ . normalization was conducted against the average of housekeeping genes _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ . relative gene _PROTEIN_ was calculated by the equation . three biological replicates were performed . plant materials were incubated in ice cold acetone for rinsed with sodium phosphate buffer twice and then incubated in a of bromo chloro indolyl d _PROTEIN_ acid _PROTEIN_ solution at for a period ranging from to overnight . stained materials were cleared overnight in ethanol . samples were examined and photographed under a microscope . for histological analysis fully expanded fifth leaves were fixed in glutaraldehyde with phosphate buffer followed by osmication with osmium tetroxide in phosphate buffer . after dehydration with an ethanol series samples were infiltrated and embedded in spurr s resin _METHOD_ according to the manufacturer s instructions . sections approximately _PROTEIN_ were obtained with a leica em microtome and then stained with toluidine blue o before microscopic observation . to check the _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ fusion proteins plant materials mounted in water or transfected protoplasts were kept in wi solution and were examined and photographed under a confocal microscope _PROTEIN_ . full length cdna of and yeast and truncated cdna of were amplified by pcr and ligated into _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . plasmids containing intact or truncated wild type yeast or the empty vector _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were transformed into which contained the plasmid . transformants were plated on medium and colonies were diluted and dotted on medium containing foa and incubated for d at . ribosome profiling analysis was performed with d old seedlings as previously described . roots of d old seedlings growing on _METHOD_ agar media were used for isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation analysis . protein sample preparation and analysis was performed as described in et al . . the final proteomic data were derived from two biological replicates with three technical replicates each . surface sterilized seeds were directly plated on agar medium plates with or without n naphthylphthalamic acid supplement and grown for d under the above mentioned conditions . phenotypes of the seedlings were observed and pictures were taken using a digital camera . gus staining was performed as described above . for the auxin treatment d old seedlings were transferred to auxin containing medium . length of primary roots was measured after d of incubation in the growth chamber . for quantitative pcr analysis d old seedlings were incubated in mock and indole acetic acid for . sequence data in this article can be found in the embl/genbank data libraries under accession numbers _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ .
