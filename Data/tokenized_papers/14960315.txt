precise regulation of calcium transporters is essential for modulating the ca signaling network that is involved in the growth and _PROTEIN_ of all _METHOD_ . the arabidopsis h /ca antiporter _PROTEIN_ is a high capacity and low affinity ca transporter and several _PROTEIN_ like transporters are found in arabidopsis . when heterologously _PROTEIN_ in yeast _PROTEIN_ is unable to suppress the ca hypersensitivity of yeast _LOCATION_ ca transporter mutants due to an n terminal autoinhibition mechanism that prevents ca transport . using a yeast screen we have identified c a x i nteracting p rotein _PROTEIN_ that activated full length _PROTEIN_ but not full length _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ encodes a novel plant protein with no bacterial fungal animal or mammalian homologs . _PROTEIN_ of a _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion in yeast and plant cells suggests that _PROTEIN_ is targeted predominantly to the _LOCATION_ . using a yeast growth assay _PROTEIN_ activated a chimeric cax construct that contained specific portions of the n terminus of _PROTEIN_ . together with other recent studies these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ is regulated by several signaling molecules that converge on the n terminus of _PROTEIN_ to regulate h /ca antiport .
in a previous study using a yeast _PROTEIN_ arabidopsis cdna library we identified and isolated several arabidopsis cdnas that allow the full length _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ yeast strain which is hypersensitive to high ca to grow in media containing high levels of ca . we named the protein products of these cdnas c a x i nteracting p roteins . in this screen four out of the six cdna clones isolated were identical and encode a protein whose function has not been previously elucidated in any organism . we have termed this gene _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ cdna consists of base pairs . basic local alignment search tool searches against genome and est databases revealed that _PROTEIN_ is a novel plant gene with no homologs in bacteria fungi animals and mammals . _PROTEIN_ has homologs in other plant species including rice wheat barley tomato grape sunflower and medicago truncatula suggesting that the _PROTEIN_ gene is specifically _PROTEIN_ in plants . _PROTEIN_ encodes a protein that consists of amino acids with a predicted molecular _METHOD_ of kda . analysis of the amino acid composition of the _PROTEIN_ polypeptide found that _PROTEIN_ is rich in the following residues arg lys glu and ser . a search for specific functional motifs by using the motifscan program revealed that there is a single zinc finger _PROTEIN_ motif at the n terminal region and also an arginine rich region located at the c terminus of _PROTEIN_ . a psort program to predict the organelle targeting signals revealed that _PROTEIN_ has multiple _LOCATION_ targeting signatures which are located in the c terminus . in addition the targetp program assigned a score of for mitochondrial localization suggesting that _PROTEIN_ might target to mitochondria in vivo . to verify the ability of _PROTEIN_ to activate _PROTEIN_ ca transport activity a yeast growth assay was performed as previously described . _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ or full length _PROTEIN_ alone did not suppress the ca hypersensitivity of the yeast _LOCATION_ ca transport defect mutant whereas coexpressing _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ could grow on mm cacl in a similar manner to the yeast cells _PROTEIN_ n terminally truncated _PROTEIN_ . this result supports the hypothesis that activation of _PROTEIN_ by _PROTEIN_ mediated h /ca antiport activity in yeast . to directly test this hypothesis we measured dependent cacl uptake into microsomal vesicles isolated from yeast strains _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ alone . h /ca transport activity was observed in _LOCATION_ vesicles from a _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ strain and a _PROTEIN_ strain . however no h /ca antiport activity was detectable in vesicles from full length _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ yeast strains . the h /ca antiport activity measured from _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ vesicles was not high about of the activity measured from vesicles but significantly meaningful compared with _PROTEIN_ alone . given that _PROTEIN_ of other full length arabidopsis cax transporters does not suppress yeast mutants deficient in _LOCATION_ ca transport we were interested in the specificity of _PROTEIN_ cax activation . as shown in _PROTEIN_ was unable to activate full length _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ specifically activated _PROTEIN_ . given that _PROTEIN_ is similar to _PROTEIN_ we were interested in determining the domains or regions within _PROTEIN_ required for _PROTEIN_ activation . in a previous study a series of _PROTEIN_ chimeras were created to determine the structural determinant required for ca transport . in those chimeras both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ lack the first amino acids that appear to be required to negatively regulate antiport activity . an n terminal truncation of _PROTEIN_ like full length _PROTEIN_ was still unable to suppress the _LOCATION_ ca transport deficiency despite lacking its autoinhibitory domain . in addition coexpressed with _PROTEIN_ was unable to suppress the yeast ca sensitivity . as shown in yeast cells _PROTEIN_ numerous proteins _PROTEIN_ were unable to suppress the ca sensitivity of yeast . for example strains in which _PROTEIN_ was coexpressed with chimeric proteins that contained the central region or c terminus of _PROTEIN_ were unable to suppress the ca sensitive phenotype . however when a chimeric protein was used that contained amino acids of the n terminal region of _PROTEIN_ fused to _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ could activate this chimeric protein suggesting that this region in _PROTEIN_ is required for _PROTEIN_ to activate _PROTEIN_ . it was demonstrated that specific amino acids residues within the n terminus of _PROTEIN_ are critical for autoinhibition . for example when serine was changed to aspartic acid and when the threonine residue was changed to any other amino acid such as alanine or glutamic acid _PROTEIN_ was no longer autoinhibited and h /ca transport could occur . in contrast other single or double point mutations within the _PROTEIN_ n terminus did not alter _PROTEIN_ autoinhibition . to test if _PROTEIN_ could allow autoinhibited _PROTEIN_ mutants to suppress the ca sensitive phenotypes we _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in yeast strains _PROTEIN_ these _PROTEIN_ mutants . as shown in some _PROTEIN_ mutants such as _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ remained autoinhibited in the presence of _PROTEIN_ . however other _PROTEIN_ single or double point mutants that retain autoinhibition were activated following coexpression with _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ did not appear to alter the activity of any of the deregulated _PROTEIN_ constructs such as the single point mutants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or the double point mutant _PROTEIN_ as these all remained active following _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . to examine _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ total rna from various tissues from mature arabidopsis plants was used for rna gel blot analysis . as shown in _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ in all tissues with highly abundant _PROTEIN_ found in leaves _METHOD_ and roots but slightly lower _PROTEIN_ in flowering tissue . to determine how _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ in response to ion stresses week old seedlings were treated with various metal ions . the _PROTEIN_ rna transcript levels were modestly increased when ca was added to the medium while the _PROTEIN_ rna levels did not change when seedlings were exposed to na mn or ni compared to control seedlings treated with h o or murashige and skoog _METHOD_ medium . interestingly _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was reduced upon zncl treatment . to investigate the subcellular localization of the _PROTEIN_ protein we constructed an n terminal _METHOD_ fusion with _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ this in yeast cells under the control of the yeast glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase promoter and in tobacco leaves or by cells under the control of a camv promoter . when _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was coexpressed with _PROTEIN_ in the yeast mutant strain the yeast cells were able to suppress the ca sensitive phenotype suggesting that the fusion protein remained functional . the localization of the fusion protein in these yeast cells was observed predominantly in the _LOCATION_ but we also saw specific microdomains in the _LOCATION_ where the fusion protein is localized . consistent with the result from yeast cells the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ transiently _PROTEIN_ in tobacco by cells was predominately located in _LOCATION_ which were visualized with propidium iodide staining . the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was also transiently _PROTEIN_ in tobacco leaves and the fusion protein was again located in the _LOCATION_ of leaf epidermal mesophyll and trichome cells . interestingly in leaf epidermal cells the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was observed in both _LOCATION_ and the cytoplasm . apparently those green _METHOD_ fusion proteins are located in discrete areas of the cytoplasm however they are not colocalized with the mitochondria .
s. cerevisiae strain _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was used in all yeast experiments involving the _PROTEIN_ of cax genes with or without _PROTEIN_ . a. thaliana columbia ecotype and nicotiana tabacum xanthi and by cell line were used in this study . yeast cells _PROTEIN_ cax transporters _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were transformed with _PROTEIN_ as described previously . stable transformants were assayed on ypd medium supplemented with mm cacl . some yeast strain colonies had different colors when grown on ca containing media and ypd medium . we found this in all our yeast growth assays . however we have never documented that these yeast cells with different colors have changed their calcium transport properties . cax chimeric constructs and _PROTEIN_ variants were previously described . microsomal _LOCATION_ enriched vesicles were isolated from yeast as described previously . time dependent h /ca transport into endomembrane vesicles was examined using the direct filtration method . rna sample preparation and northern blot analysis were performed as previously described . to fuse the _METHOD_ to the n terminus of _PROTEIN_ the _METHOD_ gene was amplified by polymerase chain reaction using the following primer sets . forward primer cgg ctc gag cca tgg tga gca _PROTEIN_ gcg reverse primer _PROTEIN_ act gga tcc gcc ctt _PROTEIN_ cag ctc _PROTEIN_ cat . xho i and bam hi sites were introduced for subsequent cloning sites . the _METHOD_ gene fragment without stop codon was cloned into xho i/ bam hi sites of pbluescript _PROTEIN_ resulting in pks _METHOD_ . the _PROTEIN_ gene was amplified by pcr using the following primer sets . forward primer gcc gga tcc _PROTEIN_ ccg cgc aca gca gga _PROTEIN_ reverse primer ggg _PROTEIN_ t ct cga g tc gac cta ctc tcg ctc ttt _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . bam hi and sac i sites were introduced for subsequent cloning sites . the _PROTEIN_ gene fragment was cloned into the bam hi/ sac i sites of pks _METHOD_ resulting in pks _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . the fusion construct was completely sequenced to confirm no pcr _LOCATION_ . the fusion protein product would have three amino acid residues added between _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ due to the introduction of the bam hi site . to _PROTEIN_ the fusion protein in the yeast cells and plants the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was subcloned into yeast _PROTEIN_ vector piugpd and the plant transient _PROTEIN_ vector . the plasmid dna of piugpd _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was used to transform the yeast strain and selected on medium . stable transformants were grown in the same selection medium and the _PROTEIN_ of the fusion protein was examined by confocal microscopy . the plasmid dna of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was delivered into tobacco leaves or by cells by biolistic particle delivery system _PROTEIN_ as previously described . for visualization of _LOCATION_ or mitochondria the bombarded by cells were briefly fixed with formaldehyde in pme _PROTEIN_ buffer at h post bombardment for min and then stained with propidium iodide or mito tracker for min . the transient _PROTEIN_ and subcellular localization of the fusion protein and _LOCATION_ or mitochondria were observed by confocal microscopy . the green channel and red channel were scanned separately to avoid cross contamination and then merged using lasersharp software provided by the manufacturer . the confocal images were processed using adobe photoshop software _METHOD_ .
