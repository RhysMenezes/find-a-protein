fatty acid desaturation of _LOCATION_ lipids is a strategy for plants to survive _PROTEIN_ or freezing temperature . to further characterize enzymes involved in this stress response pathway acyl lipid _PROTEIN_ was studied using genetic cell and biochemical approaches . _PROTEIN_ mutant plants appear similar to the wild type under standard growth conditions but display a dwarf and sterile phenotype when grown at and also show increased sensitivity to freezing temperature . fatty acid composition analysis demonstrated that _PROTEIN_ mutant plants at have reduced levels of and and higher levels of and fatty acids compared with the wild type . lipid profiling revealed that species of phosphatidylglycerol and monogalactosyl diacylglycerol content in _PROTEIN_ mutants were lower and phosphatidic acid phosphatidylinositol phosphatidylethanolamine phosphatidylcholine lyso phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylserine were higher than the wild type . subcellular localization of c and n terminal enhanced _METHOD_ fusion proteins indicated that _PROTEIN_ localized primarily to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ although signal was also confirmed in _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ . a double mutation with a putative _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ paralog exacerbates the growth defects of _PROTEIN_ mutant plants under low temperature . these observations suggest that _PROTEIN_ encodes a desaturase of mgdg and pg . we hypothesize that a low temperature induced shift from the _LOCATION_ to _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ pathway for _LOCATION_ lipid biosynthesis is required for the cold stress response in arabidopsis thaliana and _PROTEIN_ is essential to adjust the acyl composition of organelle _LOCATION_ lipid composition in response to cold stress .
acyl lipid desaturases are defined as any desaturases that used acyl lipid as substrate . based on this definition the previously characterized fatty acid desaturase family _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ can also be considered as acyl lipid desaturases since they all use acyl lipid as substrate instead of acyl coa . furthermore nine additional genes in the arabidopsis genome were cataloged as acyl lipid desaturases based on sequence similarity with cyanobacterial acyl lipid desaturases and mammalian acyl coa desaturases . these nine members are _GENE_ _PROTEIN_ _GENE_ _GENE_ _PROTEIN_ _GENE_ _PROTEIN_ and . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ a tightly linked gene cluster with and and another pair of genes on chromosome i. _PROTEIN_ is linked with on chromosome iii . phylogenic analysis revealed a close relationship among different members . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ form their own clade suggesting their common origin through gene duplication during evolutionary history . at the amino acid level _PROTEIN_ shares a higher similarity with _PROTEIN_ compared with other members . sequence alignment indicates that _PROTEIN_ and have an extra amino acids at their n termini compared with other members suggesting that duplicated genes could be differentially targeted at the subcellular level indicative of subfunctionalization and/or neofunctionalization . previous experiments have established that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is responsible for the desaturation of on mgdg at the sn position in _LOCATION_ . _PROTEIN_ was originally projected to be a acyl lipid desaturase homolog in arabidopsis based on its sequence similarity with a desaturase from rose _PROTEIN_ . biochemical analysis of yeast and arabidopsis seeds indicated that _PROTEIN_ operates on either galactolipids or phospholipids but the regiospecificity is different depending on the headgroup . however assignments of protein function based solely on heterologous _PROTEIN_ should be viewed with caution since substrate availability or protein subcellular localization in planta might affect preference and hence biological function . therefore we decided to take a genetic approach to understand the biochemical and physiological function of _PROTEIN_ in planta . seven individual t dna insertion lines were obtained from the arabidopsis information resource . using pcr we could not detect t dna insertions in and although the other five lines were confirmed and homozygous lines were obtained . rt pcr was then used to determine _PROTEIN_ gene _PROTEIN_ . we found that the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ was highly reduced in and not affected in . based on this result for convenience we renamed and as _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants respectively . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is quickly induced when plants are shifted from to suggesting _PROTEIN_ is involved in cold acclimation or _PROTEIN_ tolerance . to test this hypothesis wild type _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants were grown at and . at all four _PROTEIN_ mutant lines grew normally and there were no visible growth defects compared with the wild type . at wild type arabidopsis plants were not injured by cold exposure and continued to grow and develop during prolonged incubation although the growth rate was significantly reduced relative to at . however the growth rate of _PROTEIN_ mutants was significantly lower than the wild type at . the retarded growth phenotype became severe with prolonged exposure to low temperature especially after reproductive transition . _PROTEIN_ mutants began bolting at a similar time to that of the wild type but all four _PROTEIN_ mutants were sterile while the wild type produced abundant viable seeds at . in the wild type anther opening follows flower opening such that pollen grains are not prematurely released . in _PROTEIN_ mutant plants the anther failed to open after flowering which might be one of the _PROTEIN_ contributing to the sterile phenotype . when flowering _PROTEIN_ mutants were moved from to room temperature the phenotype was partially suppressed . the _PROTEIN_ mutant plants eventually produced viable seeds several weeks after the temperature shift indicating that the low growth temperature is one of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ responsible for these developmental defects . since _PROTEIN_ mutant plants had reduced cold tolerance we then tested their sensitivity to freezing temperature using a previously established protocol . wild type _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutant plants were grown side by side for d at and then one group of plants was moved to and grown an additional d before being exposed to a gradient of freezing temperatures . another group of plants was directly used for freezing treatment without cold acclimation . the nonacclimated plants showed a tolerance to a narrow range of freezing temperatures of plants were killed when temperature was shifted from to . without acclimation the temperature for survival is essentially the same for wild type _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutant plants . after acclimation wild type and mutant plants can survive through a much lower freezing temperature . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutant plants had a lower survival rate than the wild type between and and the temperatures that resulted in survival were and for the wild type _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ respectively . since cold acclimated _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutant plants can tolerate lower freezing temperatures compared with respective nonacclimated control plants this observation suggests that _PROTEIN_ mutant plants still retain the capacity to acclimate to low nonfreezing temperatures although not as efficiently as the wild type . to understand the biochemical basis for reduced cold and freezing tolerance of _PROTEIN_ mutants leaf fa composition was analyzed from two independent knockdown lines _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . when grown at the two _PROTEIN_ mutants did not have significant differences in fa composition compared with the wild type . by contrast _PROTEIN_ mutant plants had significantly lower levels of and and a higher level of than the wild type in agreement with _PROTEIN_ encoding a palmitoyl desaturase . when grown at and levels were and lower than wild type levels under the same conditions respectively in the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutant plants while content was to greater than wild type levels in the same two independent _PROTEIN_ mutant lines . these results indicate that _PROTEIN_ also encodes a palmitic acid desaturase . even though the leaf fa profile of _PROTEIN_ mutant plants shares many similarities with _PROTEIN_ mutant plants when plants were grown at differences emerged _PROTEIN_ fas . under the content in _PROTEIN_ mutant plants increased to and content increased to while content _PROTEIN_ to relative to the wild type . the changes in these fas were less dramatic in _PROTEIN_ mutant plants relative to the wild type under . the varying patterns _PROTEIN_ fas between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants suggests that _PROTEIN_ is also involved in desaturation of fas . fatty acid methyl ester analysis demonstrated that _PROTEIN_ desaturates palmitic acid and possibly stearic acid but did not identify which lipid species were the substrates for _PROTEIN_ desaturation . thus lipidomic analysis was conducted to identify the lipid species that were specifically reduced by _PROTEIN_ mutations . wild type _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ plants were grown at or respectively and leaf lipids were isolated for lipidomic analysis . at although the fa composition in _PROTEIN_ mutant and wild type plants was similar several lipid species showed small but statistically significant changes . for example total _PROTEIN_ lysophosphatidylethanolamine pc and phosphatidylserine content was significantly higher and total pg and mgdg content was lower in _PROTEIN_ mutant plants than in the wild type . at there was no difference _PROTEIN_ the content of total phosphatidic acid _PROTEIN_ pe lysophosphatidylcholine and dgdg between the _PROTEIN_ mutant plants and the wild type however upon exposure to low temperature _PROTEIN_ mutant plants showed more dramatic changes in their leaf lipid profile with total _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ pe lpe pc lpc and ps content being significantly higher while total pg mgdg and dgdg _PROTEIN_ substantially compared with the wild type . next we examined which lipid species subpools contribute to the reduction of total pg at lower growth temperature . in arabidopsis leaf total pg is _PROTEIN_ composed of four subpools pg pg and pg and pg . at total leaf pg contained pg pg and pg in wild type plants . the reduction of total pg in _PROTEIN_ mutant plants exclusively contributed to the _PROTEIN_ in pg pools including and this was also the case with plants grown at . we also observed that the reduction in the pg pool in _PROTEIN_ mutant plants compared with the wild type was greater at than . these data suggest that pg is a substrate for _PROTEIN_ desaturation . unlike _PROTEIN_ mutant plants _PROTEIN_ mutant plants have increased content of total pg primarily due to increased levels of pg suggesting that _PROTEIN_ does not desaturate pg . we then examined which lipid species subpools contribute to the reduction of the total mgdg pool size . in wild type arabidopsis leaves the total mgdg pool is primarily composed of three different lipids mgdg and mgdg account for and respectively of the total mgdg pool whereas mgdg is only a minor species . the content of mgdg in two _PROTEIN_ mutant lines was always lower than the wild type control _PROTEIN_ of growth temperature and contributed exclusively to the reduced content of the total mgdg pool . we then checked which mgdg molecular species was significantly reduced . in arabidopsis leaves mgdg has different unsaturation states including mgdg mgdg mgdg mgdg mgdg and mgdg . at mgdg and mgdg were significantly reduced in _PROTEIN_ and mgdg mgdg mgdg and mgdg were significantly lower in _PROTEIN_ mutant plants compared with the wild type . at mgdg mgdg mgdg and mgdg content in both _PROTEIN_ mutant plants was significantly lower than that of the wild type . these data support the notion that _PROTEIN_ also desaturates mgdg to mgdg in planta . the mgdg content in the _PROTEIN_ mutant was reduced a great degree compared with _PROTEIN_ mutant plants coinciding with concomitantly higher levels of mgdg . the data suggest that _PROTEIN_ desaturates palmitic mgdg in the _LOCATION_ since galactolipids are found predominantly in the chloroplast . our observation also supports the notion that suppressing the prokaryotic pathway leads to enhanced mgdg biosynthesis through the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ pathway . the _PROTEIN_ that mgdg and mgdg increased with a concomitant reduction in mgdg and mgdg in _PROTEIN_ mutant plants suggests that _PROTEIN_ converts mgdg to mgdg as well as mgdg to mgdg . since total dgdg content in _PROTEIN_ mutant plants is significantly lower than the wild type when plants were grown at we examined the changes in the subpool size of dgdg . in wild type arabidopsis leaves the total dgdg pool is primarily composed of three different lipids dgdg and dgdg account for and respectively of the total dgdg pool whereas dgdg accounts for < . at the dgdg and dgdg subpool size in two _PROTEIN_ mutant plants showed small changes but the statistical significance can not be confirmed for the total dgdg pool at the dgdg and dgdg subpool size in two _PROTEIN_ mutant lines displayed a significant reduction compared with the wild type . the reduction in the dgdg subpool _PROTEIN_ results from the reduced content in dgdg dgdg and dgdg similarly the reduced content in dgdg and dgdg contributes to most of the reduction in the dgdg subpool in _PROTEIN_ mutant plants . since mgdg serves as precursor for dgdg biosynthesis the reduced mgdg content in _PROTEIN_ mutant plants could result in a reduction of dgdg but the _METHOD_ leading to the dgdg reduction in _PROTEIN_ mutants remain unclear since mgdg was not significantly affected . a comparison of eight subcellular prediction _METHOD_ produced mixed results for _PROTEIN_ . while subloc and _METHOD_ predicted cytoplasmic localization ipsort mitopred multiloc peroxp predotar and targetp _METHOD_ did not offer a conclusive answer . to experimentally determine the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ enhanced yellow _METHOD_ tag protein _METHOD_ was fused in frame with _PROTEIN_ at its c terminus and the fused protein was stably _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis . protoplasts were prepared from stable transgenic plants and subcellular localization was observed by _METHOD_ microscopy . the _METHOD_ vector control signal was detected in the cytoplasm . when _METHOD_ was fused to the c terminus of _PROTEIN_ the _METHOD_ signal appeared primarily in reticulate structures . closer examination revealed that punctate spots were within the reticular network . a relatively weak _METHOD_ signal also colocalized with chloroplasts as evidenced from the change from red _METHOD_ to orange in the color overlay . these observations suggested _PROTEIN_ may have multiple subcellular destinations . to investigate if the distribution pattern of _PROTEIN_ was specific for the c terminal fusion we then examined other transgenic plants in which _METHOD_ was fused in frame with _PROTEIN_ at the n terminus . the _METHOD_ signal was also present in a visible reticulate pattern and this focal position also revealed details of the punctate spots which were _PROTEIN_ located at the reticular node . again a relatively weak _METHOD_ signal was also detected in chloroplasts . these observations demonstrated that the _METHOD_ signal pattern is similar _PROTEIN_ of n or c terminal fusions . however the punctate spots were brighter when _METHOD_ was fused at the n terminus of _PROTEIN_ than at the c terminus . however this could be due to the higher _PROTEIN_ level of _PROTEIN_ in the n terminal fusion transgenic plants that we chose for protoplast preparation . to confirm the subcellular compartment of the punctate spots _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was transiently coexpressed with _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ or _LOCATION_ organelle markers in tobacco leaves . coexpression of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _LOCATION_ marker revealed partial overlapping signal within the reticular _LOCATION_ networks . coexpression of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ with _LOCATION_ marker revealed that the punctate _METHOD_ spots colocalize with the _LOCATION_ cyan _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ marker . when coexpressing _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ with chloroplast marker a weak signal was observed for both _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ channels when adjusting the focal plane to the palisade mesophyll cell layer to detect _LOCATION_ . although the _METHOD_ signals overlapped the low intensity necessitated an orthogonal approach to confirm _LOCATION_ localization . subcellular fractionation of leaf homogenates followed by immunoblotting confirmed _PROTEIN_ presence within the rcf _LOCATION_ fraction at a comparable level to _LOCATION_ pdc . a comparison with the _LOCATION_ marker luminal binding protein _PROTEIN_ also confirmed _PROTEIN_ is enriched within the microsomal _LOCATION_ fraction confirming dual localization within both _LOCATION_ and microsomes . a mutation in _PROTEIN_ has been reported to affect chloroplast biogenesis and plant growth under low temperature . to test a possible genetic interaction between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutants were constructed and their growth performance was evaluated at both and . when grown at there was essentially no difference among wild type _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant plants . however when grown at reduced stature phenotypes were observed for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutants depending on the developmental stage for cold treatment and the duration of low temperature exposure . when d old seedlings were used for cold treatment and kept in the cold for a long period _PROTEIN_ mutant plants showed much smaller stature than the wild type and _PROTEIN_ mutants and the leaves remained dark green . by contrast the growth rate of _PROTEIN_ was only slightly affected the leaves that developed during cold exposure were chlorotic . the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutant plants were smaller than _PROTEIN_ single mutant plants and the leaves were also chlorotic like _PROTEIN_ . if plants grew at for a long period and were then subjected to cold treatment there was no apparent difference among wild type single mutant or double mutant plants . however d _PROTEIN_ at _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant plants were smaller than the parentals and the chlorotic leaf phenotype was accentuated with part of the leaf area being bleached . these observations suggest that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ have additive effects on _PROTEIN_ tolerance since a mutation in _PROTEIN_ enhanced _PROTEIN_ growth defects under low temperature . to give a quantitative overview of the mutant phenotype and its association with fa unsaturation leaf fa composition in wild type _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant plants was measured immediately before cold treatment and after cold exposure for and d. when plants were grown at for d the leaf fa composition in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutants was similar to the _PROTEIN_ single mutant including higher content of and much lower content of and . the and content in the double mutant was higher than in the wild type and _PROTEIN_ . after cold treatment at for d leaf fa composition in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutants was still similar to that of _PROTEIN_ . although the content in the _PROTEIN_ single mutant was slightly lower than the wild type and content was not significantly altered compared with the wild type . after d of cold treatment higher content and lower and content in _PROTEIN_ was observed . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ showed lower and higher contents than the wild type respectively . accordingly content in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant plants was similar to the wild type . both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ had a higher content than the wild type and the content in the double mutant was even higher than in the parental lines . thus we concluded that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ have additive effects on and accumulation .
t dna insertion lines and _PROTEIN_ were ordered from the _PROTEIN_ . seeds were sown in a mixture of water saturated vermiculite and peat moss enriched soil and grown in a growth chamber under long day conditions . for the _PROTEIN_ tolerance assay wild type and mutant seeds were first germinated in potting soil at under long day conditions and then moved to a growth chamber under continuous

the dark for h and then returned to the original growth conditions . viable plants were counted d _PROTEIN_ . lipid extraction and quantitative profiling were performed according to citation . unfractionated lipid extracts in chloroform containing appropriate amounts of internal standards were introduced by continuous infusion into the electrospray ionization source of a triple quadrupole _METHOD_ spectrometer _METHOD_ with an autosampler _PROTEIN_ . the internal standards used for quantification include the following lysopg lysopg di pg di phy pg lysope lysope di pe di pe lysopc lysopc di pc di pc _PROTEIN_ di phy _PROTEIN_ di ps di phy ps _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ di dgdg dgdg mgdg and mgdg . the analyses of mgdg and dgdg were performed in the same solvent mixture as that used for the phospholipid analysis and with different scan parameters for galactolipids . neutral loss scans in positive ion mode were used to detect the ions of mgdg and dgdg . collision energies using nitrogen as the collision gas were v for mgdg and v for dgdg . declustering potentials were v entrance potentials v and exit potentials v for both mgdg and dgdg . data processing was performed in a lipidome db data calculation environment with normalization to internal standards . for fame analysis lipids were hydrolyzed and trimethylsilylated . hydrolysis was performed with ml of m hcl in methanol and ml chloroform at for h. following hydrolysis solvents and hcl were evaporated under nitrogen . samples were then resuspended in pyridine and n methyl n _METHOD_ trifluoroacetamide and chlorotrimethylsilane and incubated for h at to produce fames . fame mixtures were analyzed using a hewlett packard gas chromatograph with a flame ionization detector and series injector . samples were injected with a split ratio of and resolved on a m mm db column . injection temperature was the interface was set to and the ion source was adjusted to . the helium flow rate was ml . after a min solvent delay at the oven temperature was increased at to and then held at for min . data processing was performed using _METHOD_ software . _PROTEIN_ cdna was pcr amplified from a cdna library by a pair of gene specific primers bamhi and noti restriction enzyme cutting sites were added to forward and reverse primers respectively . the primer sequences are cgggatccatgtcggtgacatcaacggtg and _PROTEIN_ . the pcr products were digested by bamhi and noti and then inserted into entry vectors and such that an _METHOD_ _METHOD_ tag was in frame with _PROTEIN_ at the c terminus and n terminus respectively . the cassette was then moved into binary vector psite by gateway lr clonase . the constructs were transformed into wild type arabidopsis by the agrobacterium tumefaciens mediated floral dip method . seeds were grown on murashige and skoog medium containing kanamycin and the viable green seedlings were further examined under a leica mzfl iii stereomicroscope equipped with _METHOD_

the _PROTEIN_ peptide that we used to produce anti _PROTEIN_ antibody is identical to the _PROTEIN_ sequence and initial experiments demonstrated that polyclonal _PROTEIN_ peptide antibody cross reacts with _PROTEIN_ since the _PROTEIN_ mutant is a complete knockout but a proper size band is still detected with _PROTEIN_ antibody . rabbit polyclonal antibody to _LOCATION_ pdc was used to
