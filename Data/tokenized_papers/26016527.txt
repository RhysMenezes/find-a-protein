water soluble chlorophyll proteins constitute a small family of unusual chlorophyll binding proteins that possess a kunitz type protease inhibitor domain . in arabidopsis thaliana a wscp has been identified named atwscp that _METHOD_ complexes with chl and the chl precursor chlorophyllide in vitro . atwscp exhibits a quite unexpected _PROTEIN_ pattern for a chl binding protein and accumulated to high levels in the apical hook of etiolated plants . atwscp _PROTEIN_ was negatively light regulated . transgenic _PROTEIN_ of atwscp fused to green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ revealed that atwscp is localized to cell walls/apoplastic spaces . biochemical assays identified atwscp as interacting with _PROTEIN_ a granulin domain containing cysteine protease implicated in stress responses and defense . reconstitution experiments showed tight interactions between _PROTEIN_ and wscp that were relieved upon chlide binding . laboratory feeding experiments with two herbivorous isopod crustaceans _PROTEIN_ scaber and armadillidium vulgare identified the apical hook as achilles heel of etiolated plants and that this was protected by _PROTEIN_ during greening . because chlide is formed in the apical hook during seedling emergence from the soil our data suggest an unprecedented mechanism of herbivore resistance activation that is triggered by light and involves atwscp .
wscps are characterized by the presence of the chlorophyll binding signature pfcplgi and kunitz trypsin inhibitor signature x d x x x y x . based on the occurrence of these motifs a wscp related protein was identified in arabidopsis thaliana named atwscp which is encoded by _GENE_ . sequence comparison revealed that atwscp belongs to a subfamily of kunitz protease inhibitors in arabidopsis . interestingly the protein encoded by _GENE_ lacks a predictable transit sequence for import into chloroplasts but contains a predictable signal peptide typical for proteins entering the secretory pathway . database searches using the arabidopsis _METHOD_ browser at the bio array resource platform of the university of toronto revealed atwscp transcript accumulation in dark grown but not in light grown seedlings . to substantiate this point transgenic lines were generated _PROTEIN_ bacterial _PROTEIN_ under the control of the atwscp promoter . when _PROTEIN_ of gus was analyzed almost no atwscp promoter activity was detectable in the cotyledons of dark grown seedlings . instead strong atwscp promoter activity was found around the vascular tissues and especially in those of the apical hook . in light grown seedlings of the same age no atwscp promoter activity was detectable at all . semiquantitative pcr was used to quantify atwscp transcript accumulations during greening . consistent with the atwscp promoter gus studies atwscp transcripts were detectable only in etiolated seedlings . in _PROTEIN_ levels of atwscp mrna rapidly declined during greening . by contrast abundance of lhcbii transcripts encoding the major light harvesting chl a/b binding protein of photosystem ii increased steadily . protein gel blot analyses with polyclonal antibodies against bacterially _PROTEIN_ atwscp revealed the presence of a single band the size of which matched that of the mature atwscp lacking the predicted signal peptide . the amount of this atwscp protein rapidly declined during greening . a knockout mutant line with a t dna insertion in the single exon of the atwscp gene was obtained from the salk institute genomic analysis laboratory collection and used for performing tests to define the role of atwscp in planta . genotyping confirmed the presence of homozygous plants . in western blot analyses no atwscp protein was detectable in etiolated atwscp versus wild type seedlings . when grown in the dark for d and subsequently exposed to light for and h respectively etiolated wild type and atwscp seedlings looked indistinguishable and greened with similar kinetics . quite astonishing for a protein implicated in chl binding the structure predictions described before suggested atwscp to enter the secretory pathway . to gain insights into the localization of atwscp in planta transgenic plants were generated constitutively _PROTEIN_ an atwscp green _METHOD_ _METHOD_ fusion protein under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus promoter . for comparison transgenic lines were established _PROTEIN_ fusions of _METHOD_ with wscp from lepidium virginicum and precursor ferredoxin from silene pratensis respectively . pfd is a well known example of a _LOCATION_ protein with a typical chloroplast transit peptide directing the protein into the stroma . similar to atwscp lvwscp is synthesized with a predictable signal peptide for entering the secretory pathway but nevertheless has been detected in chloroplasts from which it could be isolated and characterized . agrobacterium mediated transformation of a. thaliana wild type plants was used to obtain transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ atwscp _METHOD_ lvwscp _METHOD_ pfd _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ alone . etiolated seedlings of the generations of the different transgenic lines were analyzed by confocal laser scanning microscopy . obviously atwscp _METHOD_ signals were obtained in both the cotyledons and the apical hook . in the cotyledons atwscp _METHOD_ was not localized to the _LOCATION_ in all transgenic lines examined . instead atwscp _METHOD_ _METHOD_ appeared in the outermost parts of the cell either representing cell walls/apoplastic spaces or the tonoplast surrounding the _LOCATION_ . often huge _LOCATION_ are present in plant cells and occupy large areas . in the microscopic images analyzed the lack of intense background _METHOD_ covering uniformly the cell at first glance _METHOD_ to disprove that atwscp _METHOD_ accumulated in the soluble part of the _LOCATION_ . we can not exclude however that atwscp _METHOD_ was present in the tonoplast tightly adhering/being tightly appressed to the cell wall . such localization would be consistent with the structure predictions identifying a _LOCATION_ localization signal in atwscp . for _METHOD_ alone without atwscp attached to it a cytoplasmic localization was evident . counterstaining with calcofluor white confirmed the presence of thin primary cell walls typical for growing cells and reinforced the idea of atwscp _METHOD_ localization in cell walls/apoplastic spaces and/or the tonoplast . in transgenic lines constitutively overexpressing a fusion protein consisting of the predicted signal peptide of atwscp and _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was confined to similar regions of the cell representing cell walls/apoplastic spaces and/or _LOCATION_ . because the chimeric protein comprised only the first amino acids of atwscp and did not contain the putative _LOCATION_ targeting signal we assume that this reporter protein was localized in cell walls/apoplastic spaces while not necessarily precluding a localization of the full length atwscp in the _LOCATION_ . for lvwscp _METHOD_ a completely different localization in _LOCATION_ was found in all transgenic lines examined as was seen for pfd _METHOD_ used as control . atwscp _METHOD_ _METHOD_ distribution in the apical hook was similar to that in the cotyledons and revealed the presence of the protein in cell walls/apoplastic spaces . in _PROTEIN_ no _METHOD_ signal was present in _LOCATION_ whereas lvwscp _METHOD_ and pfd _METHOD_ gave rise to strong _LOCATION_ signals . one kunitz trypsin inhibitor in _PROTEIN_ termed _PROTEIN_ has been implicated in regulating hypocotyl growth and apical hook formation . if atwscp were to accomplish a similar role changing its amount should have severe anatomical effects . to test this hypothesis we compared seedling morphology for wild type and atwscp mutant seedlings with that of transgenic lines constitutively overexpressing atwscp under the control of the promoter . several independent atwscp lines were obtained that overexpressed atwscp . however in none of these atwscp overexpressors could differences in hypocotyl length light triggered apical hook straightening and overall seedling morphology be observed . when hypocotyl length was measured after and respectively of growth in the dark provoking skotomophogenesis no difference became apparent for wild type atwscp mutant and atwscp overexpressing plants . halls and coworkers identified atwscp as a potent inhibitor of the recombinant proaleurain maturation protease and papain . there is a small family of granulin domain containing proteases in arabidopsis encoded by _GENE_ _GENE_ _GENE_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ is most interesting because it has been implicated in various reactions conferring resistance to biotic and abiotic foes . like many other cysteine endoproteases _PROTEIN_ is encoded as a preproprotein having an terminal propeptide with autoinhibitory activity and a _PROTEIN_ terminal granulin domain containing propeptide with unknown function . the terminal propeptide is cleaved by a yet unknown mechanism either requiring an autocatalytic processing under low ph or activity of a processing enzyme . we asked whether _PROTEIN_ may interact with atwscp in etiolated plants . to test for such interactions pull down assays were conducted on protein extracts that had been prepared from the apical hook of d old etiolated wild type plants . interestingly both antibodies used the one against _PROTEIN_ and the one against atwscp coprecipitated both proteins from the tissue extract of etiolated wild type plants and thus confirmed the interaction of _PROTEIN_ and atwscp in the apical hook . with protein extracts from flashed seedlings however the _PROTEIN_ antibody precipitated only _PROTEIN_ and the atwscp antibody precipitated only atwscp . this result showed that _PROTEIN_ and atwscp no longer interacted in flash illuminated seedlings . next we isolated wscp containing complexes from the apical hook of transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ atwscp constitutively . the protein complexes in turn were subjected to nondenaturing _PROTEIN_ and detected by western blotting using the wscp and _PROTEIN_ antisera and scoring red light induced pigment _METHOD_ on x ray _METHOD_ in case the protein would be complexed with chl and/or chlide . as shown in fig ref both assays revealed the presence and light induced dissociation of higher molecular _METHOD_ complexes containing both wscp and _PROTEIN_ in the apical hook of etiolated plants . several different wscp bands of descent size were obtained which most likely represent dissociation intermediates . interestingly a pool of monomeric wscp was present already in the dark but gave rise to an autofluorescing band containing pigment only during greening . in a final experiment cdna encoded flag tagged _PROTEIN_ containing the granulin domain and his tagged mature atwscp lacking its targeting signal were produced by coupled in vitro transcription/translation of respective cdna clones purified and reconstituted into larger complexes . these complexes in turn were supplemented with chl or chlide and complex dissociation monitored by nondenaturing _PROTEIN_ as described before . fig ref depicts hmr complexes containing _PROTEIN_ and wscp and shows their chlide dependent dissociation . results shown in the supporting information proved the specificity of the wscp pigment interaction and that the dissociation of the hmr complexes led to an activation of _PROTEIN_ s proteolytic activity . this dissociation is illustrated in fig . showing the decline of both wscp and _PROTEIN_ to vanishingly low levels after prolonged incubations in white light . the results presented so far suggested a light dependent chlide and wscp mediated mechanism of _PROTEIN_ activation in the apical hook of etiolated plants during greening . we asked whether such mechanism could contribute to plant protection against herbivorous arthropods that prey on seeds and young seedlings . examples for such herbivorous arthropods are provided by _PROTEIN_ scaber and armadillidium vulgare two largely nocturnal isopod crustaceans that are generally considered to represent seed predators and detritivores but can also live as facultative herbivores . if deprived for nutrients woodlice climbed light grown plants and severed inflorescence _METHOD_ and petioles . both isopod species also attacked etiolated seedlings and selected the apical hook as primary target . quantitative assays revealed that approximately of the etiolated seedlings analyzed in three replicate experiments were severed by the isopods breaking the apical hook and dropping the cotyledons . the dropped cotyledons in turn were consumed beginning at the mid ribs and outer leaf edges but this feeding activity was delayed and occurred only h after the first attack breaking the apical hook . remarkably the primary attack at the apical hook but not subsequent feeding activity on the cotyledons was significantly reduced in the atwscp mutant containing free _PROTEIN_ and in _PROTEIN_ accounted to only of that seen on etiolated wild type seedlings . interestingly this percentage was similar to the value obtained for wild type seedlings that had been flashed and subsequently transferred to darkness for h. in marked contrast to these results no such light effect on the primary and secondary feeding activity of woodlice and pillbugs was observed for seedlings constitutively overexpressing atwscp .
seeds of the following arabidopsis thaliana lines were used for the experiments ecotype columbia that carries a t dna insertion in the gene _GENE_ encoding atwscp transgenic lines _PROTEIN_ atwscp constitutively lines carrying the promoter of atwscp in front of the _PROTEIN_ coding sequence and transgenic lines _PROTEIN_ atwscp lvwscp and pfd fused to green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ under the control of promoter _METHOD_ . for comparison transgenic seedlings _PROTEIN_ a fusion consisting of the signal peptide of atwscp and _METHOD_ _METHOD_ were produced . seeds were plated onto murashige skoog agar medium and germinated in the dark or in white light for appropriate periods . populations of wild type atwscp mutant and atwscp overexpressing plants were grown for d in darkness on petri dishes and the open dishes were then transferred to a large box filled to a depth of cm with soil and containing p. scaber and a. vulgare . cultivation of the isopods was performed essentially as described in ref . citation . for feeding experiments p. scaber and a. vulgare were fed with pesticide free arabidopsis wild type plants then starved for d and placed at low density of per liter of soil into the nutrient chamber . at different times feeding was measured by counting the number of plants with damaged apical hooks and/or dropped cotyledons . protein extracts of etiolated seedlings were prepared according to hurkman and tanaka . briefly tissues were extracted with doubly concentrated _PROTEIN_ sample buffer separated on _PROTEIN_ gels and blotted onto nitrocellulose _LOCATION_ . western blotting was carried out according to towbin et al . by using an alkaline phosphatase based system with bromo chloro indolyl phosphate and nitro blue tetrazolium or enhanced chemiluminescence respectively . pull down assays on protein extracts of the apical hook region were performed with antibodies raised against the bacterially _PROTEIN_ and purified atwscp and antibodies against _PROTEIN_ using standard procedures . isolation of hmr atwscp complexes was achieved by ni _PROTEIN_ agarose chromatography of apical hook extracts that had been prepared from transgenic seedlings overexpressing a atwscp protein . in vitro reconstitution experiments and pigment _METHOD_ screens were carried out with cdna encoded wheat germ translated proteins containing or lacking methionine and isolated pigments . semiquantitative pcr was carried out on dna templates that had been generated by first strand cdna synthesis using appropriate primers as described in the si materials and methods . atwscp promoter activity was scored in transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ by using standard procedures . image acquisition was made with an eclipse e microscope or a binocular and documented with an olympus camera .
