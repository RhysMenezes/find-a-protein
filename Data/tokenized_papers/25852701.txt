ultraviolet b radiation acts as an environmental stimulus but in high doses it has detrimental effects on plant metabolism . _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ represent a major target for reactive oxygen species generated by this harmful radiation . oxidative reactions occurring in the apoplastic space are counteracted by antioxidative _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ involving ascorbate and to some extent glutathione . the occurrence of the latter and its exact role in the _LOCATION_ space are not well documented however . in arabidopsis thaliana the gamma glutamyl transferase isoform _PROTEIN_ bound to the cell wall takes part in the so called gamma glutamyl cycle for _LOCATION_ glutathione degradation and recovery and may be implicated in redox sensing and balance . in this work oxidative conditions were imposed with ultraviolet b radiation and studied in redox altered _PROTEIN_ mutants . the response of _PROTEIN_ knockout arabidopsis leaves to uv b radiation was assessed by investigating changes in _LOCATION_ glutathione and ascorbate content and their redox state and in apoplastic protein composition . our results show that on uv b exposure soluble antioxidants respond to the oxidative conditions in both genotypes . rearrangements occur in their apoplastic protein composition suggesting an involvement of hydrogen peroxide which may ultimately act as a signal . other important changes relating to hormonal effects cell wall remodeling and redox activities are discussed . we argue that oxidative stress conditions imposed by uv b and disruption of the gamma glutamyl cycle result in similar stress induced responses to some degree at least . data are available via proteomexchange with identifier .
an increase in ggt enzymatic activity was found in wt plants after uv b irradiation this increase was greater in total leaf extracts than in ecwf . activity in the mutant was significantly lower in total leaf extracts and almost undetectable in the ecwf _PROTEIN_ but no significant differences were observed after uv b exposure . ggt activity ascorbate gsh and cys gly content in total leaf extract . values are the mean s.e . of biological replicates from technical replicates . for ggt activity the reference value of the wild type control was mu/g fw . asterisks indicate p . ggt activity glutathione ascorbate and cys gly in ecwf . gray bars show total content white bars oxidized _METHOD_ . reported values are the mean s.e . of technical replicates each conducted with at least biological replicates . different letters indicate significant differences between conditions . for ggt activity the reference value of the wild type control was mu/ml ecwf . ascorbate was only found in its reduced form in total leaf extracts and was increased by uv b treatment in both genotypes . we found no reduction in the ascorbate in the apoplastic space where we could only measure the oxidized form dehydroascorbate . we found no significant differences between the genotypes or treatments in the total glutathione or cys gly content in total leaf extract . in ecwf total glutathione content was higher in the _PROTEIN_ mutant than in the wild type and supplementing uv b radiation did not alter these values . gssg was lower in the ecwf from wt leaves under uv b treatment whereas oxidized cys gly increased significantly under the same conditions . it should be noted that apoplastic glutathione is only a small fraction of total leaf glutathione so fluctuations in the apoplast are somewhat diluted during the extraction process . for the same reason variations in the small amount of _LOCATION_ dha may not have been reflected in total leaf extracts . in total proteins were uniquely identified by the lc _METHOD_ analyses were found in at least two biological replicates . based on the gene ontology assignment for cellular compartmentalization we restricted our analysis to the proteins that were either apoplastic or unlocalized accounting for approximately of the total . should be considered bearing in _PROTEIN_ that several truly _LOCATION_ proteins have yet to be properly assigned to the apoplast . in _PROTEIN_ it has been reported _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ that about of proteins secreted in the apoplast lack a leaderless secretory tag . there are consequently many unpredicted secretory proteins in plants and their occurrence is often underestimated or they are even considered improperly as contaminants . our decision to restrict our assignments according to the uniprot database was therefore rigorous but probably led to an underestimation of the truly apoplastic proteins . the variations considered were further restricted to proteins exhibiting an at least fold change in _PROTEIN_ . various information can be drawn from comparisons between the four experimental conditions the effect of uv b treatment on each genotype differential apoplastic protein composition in _PROTEIN_ vs. wt possible differences in the behavior of the _PROTEIN_ mutant and the wt under uv b . comparing the two genotypes proteins were downregulated and only three were upregulated in _PROTEIN_ by comparison with the wt under physiological conditions . uv b treatment resulted in proteins being downregulated in _PROTEIN_ and in being downregulated and being upregulated in the wt . when the _PROTEIN_ and wt were compared after uv b treatment it emerged that proteins were _PROTEIN_ less and were _PROTEIN_ more in the mutant than in the wild type . a condensed view of all these variations is given in table . brief overview of _PROTEIN_ changes in apoplastic and unlocalized proteins in the four conditions analyzed wt _PROTEIN_ ctrl _PROTEIN_ and uv b _PROTEIN_ . to facilitate the interpretation of the results we ran a bioinformatic analysis with a tool for the functional annotation of sequences and data mining based on the go vocabulary . this made it easy to assess and visualize the relative abundance of functional _METHOD_ _METHOD_ in the category of biological processes based on a score assigned by the algorithm . within the category of biological processes the go _METHOD_ involved under the four conditions and either down or upregulated are shown in figures respectively . go _METHOD_ distribution in the biological process of downregulated proteins . black bars shows wt dark gray bars _PROTEIN_ light gray is ctrl _PROTEIN_ and white bars is uv b _PROTEIN_ . go _METHOD_ distribution in the biological process of upregulated proteins . black bars shows wt dark gray bars _PROTEIN_ light gray is ctrl _PROTEIN_ and white bars is uv b _PROTEIN_ . based on the scores uv b in both the wild type and the _PROTEIN_ mutant _PROTEIN_ seem to cause a lower _PROTEIN_ of proteins in the metabolic process and response to stimulus categories . far fewer proteins were upregulated but the analysis as a whole again showed that the response to stimulus and metabolic process categories scored highest but only after the uv b treatment in both genotypes . based on the results shown in table the variations observed were functionally grouped as explained below . for the sake of simplicity the proteins listed in table were divided into broad categories but many of those described here could have been placed in more than one category . gibberellins are hormones that can be found in the apoplastic space too _PROTEIN_ . here we found the gibberellin regulated protein upregulated by uv b treatment in the mutant . among the proteins targeted by hormones there is a galactose binding domain containing protein with a putative function in response to karrikins a novel group of plant growth regulators . this protein is downregulated in the wild type under uv b treatment and in the _PROTEIN_ mutant in physiological conditions . by comparison with the wild type two pathogen related proteins are less _PROTEIN_ in the _PROTEIN_ mutant i.e. pr and pr reportedly regulated by brassinosteroids . another protein involved in lipid catabolism and response to pathogens is a gdsl esterase/lipase that is _PROTEIN_ more in the _PROTEIN_ mutant than in the wild type under uv b. proteolytic enzymes are directly or indirectly involved in several plant cellular processes including resistance to pathogens and disease . in our study we identified four members of the aspartyl protease family a class of enzymes acting as endopeptidases to remove aspartic residues from polypeptide chains . one of them is downregulated in the wild type after uv b treatment and in the _PROTEIN_ mutant in physiological conditions . this protein and are both upregulated in _PROTEIN_ by comparison with the wild type as an effect of uv b treatment . is downregulated under uv b in the mutant and is downregulated in the mutant under control conditions . it could be hard to explain these opposite effects in the _PROTEIN_ of members of the same aspartyl protease family but it is worth noting that these enzymes are reportedly involved in plant defenses and development . up to of plant cell walls consist of three types of polysaccharide cellulose hemicelluloses and pectins . their composition and structure differ from one species to another and change as plants develop and with environmental fluctuations _PROTEIN_ . six proteins belonging to the class of glycoside hydrolases are downregulated by uv b radiation in the wild type while another six proteins are upregulated . comparing the _PROTEIN_ mutant with the wild type clearly revealed a constitutive downregulation of proteins related to cell wall remodeling . one of them is downregulated both in the mutant under physiological conditions and in the wild type after uv b treatment . an opposite response to uv b radiation emerged for beta _PROTEIN_ which was higher in the wild type and lower in _PROTEIN_ after the treatment . uv b radiation resulted in a lower _PROTEIN_ in the _PROTEIN_ mutant of other cell wall remodeling proteins namely arabinofuranosidase xylosidase and the berberine bridge enzyme . we also found a lower _PROTEIN_ of chitinase in the _PROTEIN_ mutant than in the wild type both under physiological conditions and after treatment with uv b . in this study we observed changes in four proteins containing leucine rich repeats and in two cysteine rich secretory proteins belonging to a class acting as kinases . leucine and cysteine rich proteins are transmembrane proteins that are reportedly induced by ros and salicylic acid . all leucine rich proteins were downregulated in the mutant under physiological conditions . it _METHOD_ particularly interesting that _PROTEIN_ was also downregulated in the wild type under uv b radiation . the two cysteine rich repeat secretory proteins and were both downregulated in the _PROTEIN_ mutant under physiological conditions . these proteins are also pm associated receptor like kinases and interacts with one or more unknown pm localized aba receptor whereas is involved in response to karrikins . the like domain containing protein is part of a class of small proteins that act as signaling molecules . in our study was upregulated in the wild type under uv b . one protein involved in response to oxidative stress was downregulated under uv b in the wild type . this protein is involved in metabolism acting as an oxidase . also peroxidase was downregulated in the _PROTEIN_ mutant under control conditions . two glutathione s transferases _PROTEIN_ proteins belonging to categories and were upregulated in the wild type plants after uv b radiation . when the two genotypes were compared after the same treatment the _PROTEIN_ level was lower in the former . two proteins in the germin like family were downregulated in _PROTEIN_ one in physiological conditions and the other after uv b treatment . these proteins are involved in defending against biotic and environmental stress . superoxide dismutase proteins are reportedly involved in removing superoxide radicals from the apoplast following uv b radiation . in our study the _PROTEIN_ of superoxide dismutase was upregulated in the wild type after uv b radiation and in _PROTEIN_ under physiological conditions .

test using xlstat . in both cases bonferroni 's test was used to ascertain differences between means . significance was established at p . proteins obtained from infiltration were quantified by bicinchoninic acid spectrophotometric assay of proteins were loaded in a homemade sodium dodecyl sulfate _PROTEIN_ gel and the electrophoretic run was stopped as soon as the protein extracts entered the running gel . bands were excised and washed several times with mm triethylammonium bicarbonate and dried under vacuum after a short acetonitrile wash. cysteines were reduced with mm dithiothreitol for h at and alkylated with mm iodoacetamide for min at room temperature in the dark . gel pieces were then washed with alternate steps of teab and acetonitrile and dried . proteins were digested in situ with sequencing grade modified trypsin at overnight . peptides were extracted with three steps of acetonitrile in water . one of each sample was withdrawn to check digestion efficiency using lc _METHOD_ analysis and the remaining peptide solution was dried under vacuum . peptides were labeled with itraq reagents _PROTEIN_ according to the manufacturer 's instructions . they were labeled with the four itraq tags using a latin panel strategy wt uv b _PROTEIN_ uv b wt ctrl and _PROTEIN_ ctrl were labeled respectively with and tags in the first replicate tags in the second and tags in the third . prior to mixing the samples in a ratio of each sample was analyzed separately to check label efficiency by lc _METHOD_ analysis setting the itraq labeling as a variable modification in the database search . all the peptides were correctly identified as being itraq modified at the n terminus and at each lysine residue . the samples were then pooled and dried under vacuum . the mixture of labeled samples was suspended in of buffer a and loaded onto a strong cation exchange cartridge for fractionation according to . after a washing step with buffer a the peptides were eluted stepwise
