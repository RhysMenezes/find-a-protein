the serine proteinase inhibitor tissue _PROTEIN_ pathway inhibitor _METHOD_ inhibits the tissue _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ viia complex and thereby impairs _PROTEIN_ xa and subsequently thrombin generation . here we show that thrombin itself up regulates _METHOD_ mrna and protein _PROTEIN_ in human liver myofibroblasts a cell type shown to _PROTEIN_ high levels of _METHOD_ j. biol . chem . . this effect required thrombin catalytic activity as shown by its abolition with hirudin . although the thrombin effect could be mimicked by agonists of both protease activated receptor _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ it was largely blocked by a _PROTEIN_ blocking antibody . transactivation of the epidermal growth _PROTEIN_ receptor has been reported as a common event in thrombin signaling . however thrombin did not detectably transactivate the egf receptor in liver myofibroblasts and blocking the egf receptor did not affect _METHOD_ induction . on the other hand thrombin increased the _PROTEIN_ of cyclooxygenase _PROTEIN_ mrna via a mapk dependent pathway and a specific _PROTEIN_ inhibitor abolished the effect of thrombin on _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . thus thrombin through _PROTEIN_ signaling up regulates the synthesis of _METHOD_ via a mapk/cox dependent pathway . the up regulation of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ by thrombin could in turn down regulate thrombin generation and contribute to limit blood coagulation .
northern blot with total rna showed several transcripts for human _METHOD_ . in addition to the kb transcript the previously described kb transcript actually resolved into separate and kb bands respectively . these two species could not be discriminated enough for separate quantitation on gels . it is likely that they arise through differential polyadenylation . two higher molecular weight bands were also found in minor amounts . addition of thrombin to human liver myofibroblasts in serum free conditions dose dependently increased the _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ transcripts . the increase could be observed as soon as h following thrombin addition and was maximal after h . all transcripts were up regulated in parallel . variations in _METHOD_ protein _PROTEIN_ were studied by measuring the amount of _METHOD_ deposited into the ecm by using western blot . when the intensity of the kda band was measured in four independent experiments conducted in quadruplicate there was a significant increase as compared with the control . _METHOD_ is closely related to _METHOD_ . we thus also studied _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and its regulation by thrombin by northern blot . our results show first that _METHOD_ is indeed _PROTEIN_ in human liver myofibroblasts and that its _PROTEIN_ is also up regulated by thrombin . in order to check whether thrombin effects were specific to liver myofibroblasts we used the human bladder carcinoma cell line ecv known to _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . as shown in fig . thrombin also up regulated _METHOD_ in ecv cells . the kinetics were different however since _PROTEIN_ peaked at h and was back to control values at h. in addition although all transcripts were up regulated the kb level remained elevated for a longer time . most thrombin effects are believed to be mediated through protease activated receptors . we first checked by using rt pcr whether human liver myofibroblasts _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . as shown in fig . these cells _PROTEIN_ the three putative thrombin receptors _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ as well as _PROTEIN_ a receptor for trypsin and _PROTEIN_ xa . in order to know whether thrombin actually used these receptors we incubated the cells with thrombin together with hirudin which specifically inhibits thrombin catalytic activity . as demonstrated in fig . b and c hirudin completely abolished the stimulating effect of thrombin on _METHOD_ mrna _PROTEIN_ . hirudin by itself had no effect . the _PROTEIN_ agonist peptide sfllrnpnrkyepf dose dependently up regulated _METHOD_ mrna _PROTEIN_ in myofibroblasts . the _PROTEIN_ agonist peptide gypgqv also increased _METHOD_ mrna _PROTEIN_ at a concentration of . in order to discriminate the relevance of each receptor we took advantage of the existence of an antibody that blocks the cleavage of _PROTEIN_ by thrombin . as shown in fig . this antibody markedly reduced thrombin induced _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . we then analyzed the transduction pathways involved in the effect of thrombin . thrombin quickly induced the phosphorylation of both _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ . addition of the mek inhibitor to thrombin stimulated cells completely blocked _METHOD_ induction . as observed previously thrombin rapidly up regulated the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ mrna in liver myofibroblasts . the maximal increase was seen h after stimulation and _PROTEIN_ transcripts returned to control values at h . induction by thrombin was prevented by using the mapkk inhibitor . in order to know whether _PROTEIN_ was involved in thrombin induced up regulation of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ cells were exposed to thrombin in the absence or in the presence of the specific _PROTEIN_ inhibitor ns . as shown in fig . b and c ns completely abolished the increase in _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ evoked by thrombin . ns had no effect on the induction of _PROTEIN_ mrna _PROTEIN_ by thrombin . the inhibitory effect of ns could be completely reversed by the direct addition of prostaglandin to the cells . several cellular effects of thrombin have been shown to be relayed through the transactivation of the egf receptor by thrombin . this possibility was first evaluated in our model by investigating the phosphorylation status of the egf receptor in thrombin stimulated cells . when cellular extracts were analyzed by western blotting with an anti phosphotyrosine antibody no increase in the phosphorylation of bands co migrating with the egf receptor could be seen over a period of min . this result was confirmed by blotting with an antibody specifically recognizing the phosphorylated egf receptor and by immunoprecipitating tyrosine phosphorylated proteins followed by blotting with the anti phospho egf receptor antibody . in order to exclude any role for the egf receptor we treated thrombin stimulated cells with _PROTEIN_ a specific inhibitor of the egf receptor kinase . this did not modify _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ although it efficiently blocked egf induced receptor autophosphorylation . an egf receptor blocking antibody did not impair the effect of thrombin on _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . these results suggest that transactivation of the egf receptor is unlikely to explain the results obtained in our model . although thrombin clearly up regulates _METHOD_ mrna and protein _PROTEIN_ the resulting functional effect could be annihilated if _METHOD_ proved to be a substrate for the proteolytic activity of thrombin . this was tested in a functional assay measuring the ability of recombinant _METHOD_ to inhibit plasmin activity toward the colorimetric substrate . as shown in fig . recombinant _METHOD_ readily inhibited plasmin and this effect was not _PROTEIN_ by previous treatment with thrombin . furthermore when thrombin treated _METHOD_ was analyzed by western blot no difference was found by comparison with native _METHOD_ .
