as in mammalian _METHOD_ heterotrimeric g proteins composed of and subunits are present in plants and are involved in the regulation of development and cell signaling . besides the sole prototypical g protein subunit gene _PROTEIN_ the arabidopsis thaliana genome has three extra large _PROTEIN_ binding protein encoding genes _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . the c termini of the xlgs are domains that are homologous to _PROTEIN_ whereas their n termini each contain a cysteine rich region and a putative _LOCATION_ localization signal . _METHOD_ fusions with each xlg confirmed _LOCATION_ localization . all three xlg genes are _PROTEIN_ in essentially all plant organs with strong _PROTEIN_ in vascular tissues primary root _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ root primordia . analysis of single double and triple t dna insertional mutants of the xlg genes revealed redundancy in xlg function . dark grown _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ triple mutant plants showed markedly increased primary root length compared with wild type plants . this phenotype was not observed in dark grown xlg single mutants and was suppressed upon complementation of the xlg triple mutant with each xlg . root cell sizes of the xlg triple mutant and root morphology were highly similar to those of wild type roots suggesting that xlgs may regulate cell proliferation . dark grown roots of the xlg triple mutants also showed altered sensitivity to sugars aba hyposensitivity and ethylene hypersensitivity whereas seed germination in xlg triple mutants was hypersensitive to osmotic stress and aba . as plant specific proteins regulatory _METHOD_ of xlgs may differ from those of conventional .
results from southern blotting by citation indicated that additional gene in the arabidopsis genome exist which are sufficiently similar to _PROTEIN_ that they can hybridize with the full length _PROTEIN_ cdna probe . with completion of the arabidopsis genome sequence two more genes encoding xlgs were found by sequence homology search _PROTEIN_ which was originally annotated as extra large g protein like and _PROTEIN_ which was originally annotated as g protein subunit putative . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ have and similarity to _PROTEIN_ respectively . the three predicted proteins share similar conserved structural features . in this report we provide evidence that the three proteins encoded by these genes exhibit functional redundancy . therefore we propose that the annotation of _GENE_ as _PROTEIN_ and _GENE_ as _PROTEIN_ a nomenclature that is extant on the tair website be universally adopted . as for _PROTEIN_ a domain is present in the c terminal regions of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ as deduced by a scan of the sequences using the ncbi conserved domain search and the protein families database of alignments and hidden markov models . the c terminal regions of the conceptually translated _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ have and similarity to _PROTEIN_ respectively . a comparison of critical residues for g protein structure and function between conventional g proteins and _PROTEIN_ has been elaborated by citation . as observed for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ also _PROTEIN_ most features of domains g to g regions of the _PROTEIN_ domain a helical domain between the g and g regions and an aspartate /glutamate rich loop between the g and g regions . although all three xlg proteins _PROTEIN_ some of the conserved amino acids within the _PROTEIN_ domain there are also variations in some amino acid residues that have been thought to be critical for _PROTEIN_ binding and hydrolysis . in the g region for ntp binding _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ both have gxxxxgtst whereas _PROTEIN_ has gxxxxgatt . in the g and g regions both of which are involved in _PROTEIN_ hydrolysis _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ the conserved d and t in the g region _PROTEIN_ has the conserved d in the g region but lacks the t in the g region . all three xlgs lack the conserved d g and q in the g region . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ all conserved residues in the g region for guanine interaction whereas _PROTEIN_ has one variation in the g region the n is replaced by a t. as is also true for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ do not have the c terminal cysteine for adp ribosylation by pertussis toxin or the arginine residue for adp ribosylation by cholera toxin which are found in some . a cysteine rich region in the n termini of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ shows the same cysteine spacing pattern as in _PROTEIN_ . however unlike _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ do not possess a tonb box consensus sequence . all three xlgs have predicted _LOCATION_ localization sequences and are predicted by psort to localize to the _LOCATION_ . besides the three xlgs the arabidopsis genome also contains four genes annotated as encoding xlg related proteins . these proteins share weak similarity to xlgs but high similarity to one another . _GENE_ _GENE_ and are and similar to at the amino acid level respectively . none of these xlg related proteins is predicted to have a domain by either ncbi conserved domain search or pfam and nor do these xlg related proteins have the cysteine rich region that is highly conserved in the xlgs . however the c terminal regions of xlg related proteins do show similarity to parts of the xlg n termini . the xlgs and the xlg related proteins may share an evolutionary relationship but there is little evidence from sequence analysis for a functional connection . to confirm the bioinformatic prediction of a _LOCATION_ localization sequence in the n termini of xlg proteins the n termini of the xlg coding regions were fused upstream of a _METHOD_ reporter and the resulting constructs were used to transiently transform vicia faba leaves via biolistic particle bombardment . the _METHOD_ of all three xlg n terminus _METHOD_ _METHOD_ fusion proteins is localized in the _LOCATION_ . similarly _METHOD_ of the full length xlg proteins with n terminal _METHOD_ or c terminal _METHOD_ _METHOD_ fusions also localizes in the _LOCATION_ confirming _LOCATION_ localization independent of the position of the _METHOD_ tag within the fusion protein . localization in the nucleoplasm was confirmed by z axis sectioning using confocal microscopy . results from reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction indicate that the three xlg genes are _PROTEIN_ in the roots hypocotyls cotyledons rosette leaves cauline leaves _METHOD_ flowers and green siliques of arabidopsis consistent with microarray results from public databases . to investigate _PROTEIN_ patterns in more detail promoters of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ genes were fused upstream of the gus reporter gene and the resulting constructs were transformed into columbia wild type plants to generate xlg promoter gus lines . staining of these pxlg gus lines revealed strong _PROTEIN_ in shoot vasculature and meristem . figure shows results from gus lines and figure is from a gus line these results are typical of the data for all three xlgs.figure shows _PROTEIN_ of gus at the base of the flower and in sepals _PROTEIN_ stigma and anthers the pattern of gus staining was identical whereas gus did not _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ stigma or pollen under the same staining conditions . at higher magnification staining of the vascular tissue of sepals and filaments was evident for all three pxlg gus constructs and gus and gus _PROTEIN_ in veins of _PROTEIN_ was also seen . the xlg genes are _PROTEIN_ in young seedlings grown both in light and darkness . darker gus staining was observed in the _PROTEIN_ root primordia . similar darkly stained areas were also consistently observed in the hypocotyls but their significance is unknown . corresponding to the root phenotype in the xlg triple mutant which will be described _PROTEIN_ all three xlg genes are strongly _PROTEIN_ in the radicle in the primary root meristem and columnella cells and in the _PROTEIN_ root primordia . the xlg genes are _PROTEIN_ in both xylem and phloem of primary roots . _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ was strong throughout the entire root tip whereas _PROTEIN_ exhibited a more restricted _PROTEIN_ pattern . analysis of publicly available cell specific root microarray data is consistent with the root _PROTEIN_ patterns observed and reveals an interesting fold enrichment of _PROTEIN_ transcript levels in the quiescent center . to facilitate the study of the biological functions of the xlgs we screened for t dna insertional mutants of the xlg genes in the publicly available collections . all t dna insertion sites were confirmed on both sides of the insertion by genomic pcr followed by sequencing of the pcr product using upstream and downstream gene specific primers in combination with t dna specific primers . figure depicts the single t dna insertional mutants used in this study . the t dna insertion in _PROTEIN_ is in the promoter region . although a polyclonal _PROTEIN_ antibody is available that identifies recombinant _PROTEIN_ protein the specificity and sensitivity of this antibody was not sufficient to assess xlg protein levels in planta and additional attempts to raised xlg antibodies have been unsuccessful to date . however based on rt pcr analysis and quantitative real time pcr analysis of _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ mutation reduces _PROTEIN_ of full length _PROTEIN_ transcript approximately fourfold . _PROTEIN_ does not produce a full length transcript but it does produce a truncated _PROTEIN_ transcript at a level that is only of the full length transcript present in wild type as assessed by quantitative real time rt pcr . _PROTEIN_ is a null mutation as assessed using pairs of gene specific primer both upstream and downstream of the t dna insertion site . all of these mutations are recessive . given their sequence similarity it is possible that the three xlgs have functional overlap . therefore plants harboring the mutant alleles depicted in figure which were the best available alleles in the col background were used to generate double and triple mutants . the homozygous triple mutant _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ will hereafter be referred to as the xlg triple mutant . homozygous xlg single mutant lines along with wild type were tested on agar plates and in soil with or without various hormone nutrient and light treatments . in > different conditions no significant phenotypic differences from wild type were observed suggesting redundancy of xlg function . by contrast striking root phenotypes were observed for the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant and the xlg triple mutant when grown in darkness . correlating with strong xlg _PROTEIN_ in the root apical meristem etiolated _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutants and xlg triple mutants showed much longer primary roots as compared with wild type plants . the primary root length of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant plants is fold that of the wild type plants whereas the primary roots of the xlg triple mutant plants are fold longer than those of wild type . the differences in root length of these mutants could be detected as early as days after growth in darkness . considering different mutational strengths of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ alleles it is not surprising to see a graduated phenotype among single double and triple mutants . complementation experiments in which either an empty vector or cdnas for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ were introduced into the triple mutant confirmed xlg mutation as the cause of the phenotype . partial or complete suppression of the long root phenotype was observed in nine out of independent _PROTEIN_ complementation lines eight out of eight independent _PROTEIN_ complementation lines and five out of five independent _PROTEIN_ complementation lines whereas none of independent empty vector lines showed any complementation . for each of these lines at least individual seedlings were assessed per line . the complementation experiments definitively associate the long root phenotype with xlg mutation . moreover it is doubtful that the use of the promoter in this case led to overexpression because for example _METHOD_ _METHOD_ could not be detected in the lines complemented with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ despite the _PROTEIN_ that restoration of a wild type phenotype was observed indicating that the transgene was _PROTEIN_ at very low levels . in addition quantitative real time pcr analysis showed that lines complemented with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ had levels of these transgene transcripts that were similar to those of the native genes in wild type col . to assess whether increased root length in the xlg triple mutant was the result of increased cell elongation we evaluated the length of root epidermal cells in the xlg triple mutant versus wild type plants grown in darkness on sucrose conditions that maximize differences in root length . the _METHOD_ dye was used to clearly delineate cell size . as shown in figure cell lengths of the xlg triple mutant are only fold larger than those of wild type plants . this slight increase is not sufficient to account for the fold increase in root length . in addition there were no evident differences in the sizes of cells in the root meristematic region or elongation zone and the proportional sizes of the zones of cell division and cell elongation were indistinguishable from wild type . no visible difference in patterning of root cell types or cellular morphology was seen in the xlg triple mutant by confocal laser scanning microscopy using the _METHOD_ dye to visualize cellular morphology . increased root length in the presence of sucrose is a characteristic of some sugar insensitive mutants and conventional heterotrimeric g proteins are involved in sugar sensing . as the experiments reported in figure were performed in the presence of sucrose which is a standard media composition we further evaluated the effects of sucrose concentrations ranging from to on the root length phenotype of the xlg triple mutant . although both wild type and xlg triple mutants showed _PROTEIN_ root lengths at both low sucrose concentrations and at high sucrose concentrations the xlg triple mutants showed considerable growth promotion over wild type at sucrose concentrations between and . at sucrose primary roots of the xlg triple mutant were almost twice as long as those of wild type . maximum differential growth between the xlg triple mutant and wild type roots was observed at sucrose . accordingly root growth at _PROTEIN_ fructose and mannitol molarities equivalent to sucrose was also evaluated . enhanced root length of dark grown xlg triple mutants was also observed in the presence of _PROTEIN_ and fructose although less so . of interest is the observation that root growth of the xlg triple mutant was less than in wild type in the presence of mannitol . this result suggests that the xlg triple mutant is hypersensitive to osmotic stress but yet can overcome this hypersensitivity at concentrations of metabolizable sugars . in support of this hypothesis root length of the xlg triple mutant was reduced to wild type values on sucrose and was actually shorter than wild type on concentrations of _PROTEIN_ fructose and mannitol . xlg triple mutant plants were also hypersensitive to the non metabolizable sugars l _PROTEIN_ and o methyl d _PROTEIN_ . because selected sugar insensitive or _PROTEIN_ insensitive mutants reveal interaction between sugar signaling and aba or ethylene signaling pathways we also evaluated root growth responses of the xlg triple mutant to these phytohormones . as illustrated in figure dark grown xlg triple mutants were indeed less sensitive than wild type to aba inhibition of primary root growth and much more sensitive than wild type to inhibition of root elongation by the ethylene precursor acc . because mutants in sugar sensing often exhibit seed germination phenotypes we also evaluated the sugar and aba sensitivity of germination in the xlg triple mutant . at low sugar concentrations germination of the xlg triple mutant was statistically identical to wild type with all sugars tested including sucrose . at higher sugar concentrations the xlg triple mutant showed inhibition of germination when compared with wild type . however this appears to be an osmotic stress phenotype rather than a sugar sensing phenotype as it is uniformly observed with all sugars tested including mannitol . despite hyposensitivity of primary root growth to aba in the xlg triple mutant this mutant shows hypersensitivity to aba inhibition of seed germination about inhibition of germination was observed at aba for the xlg triple mutant as compared with the aba required for wild type seeds . to assess whether there is any phenotypic correlation between the xlg triple mutants and heterotrimeric g protein mutants comparative morphological analyses were performed . because growth phenotypes may vary with subtle differences in environmental conditions _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant and the xlg triple mutant were grown and assessed simultaneously for growth assays even for established _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ phenotypes . when grown in darkness under our particular conditions plants harboring an _PROTEIN_ mutation also had longer roots than wild type although not as long as the xlg triple mutant . root length of the _PROTEIN_ mutant was indistinguishable from wild type as has also been previously reported for light grown plants . as reported before mature rosettes of the _PROTEIN_ and the _PROTEIN_ mutants have rounded rosette leaves and a smaller rosette diameter relative to wild type whereas the xlg triple mutant is indistinguishable from wild type at this developmental stage . unlike the _PROTEIN_ mutants which have shorter but wider siliques with blunt tips the xlg triple mutant siliques exhibit a wild type morphology .
in this study if the intergenic region upstream of the xlg gene was < kb the entire intergenic region was defined as the promoter of the gene . if the upstream intergenic region was longer than kb the promoter was defined as a kb intergenic region immediately upstream of the start codon of the xlg gene . using these criteria the promoters of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ genes are and bp respectively . the promoters of the xlg genes were amplified by pcr cloned into _PROTEIN_ topo vector sequenced and then subcloned upstream of the gus gene of binary vector pgptv _PROTEIN_ . the constructs were transformed into wild type plants via agrobacterium mediated transformation . transformants were selected from progeny based on growth on selective antibiotic marker containing medium and were confirmed by genotyping pcr . embryos of pxlg gus lines dissected from the seed after h of imbibition young seedlings grown on agar plates for days or young leaves or flowers from plants germinated on agar plates for days and then transplanted to soil for weeks were stained in gus staining solution as described by citation . for each construct at least independent lines were examined . cdnas encoding the n terminal regions of the xlg proteins _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were fused upstream of _METHOD_ encoding _METHOD_ a variant of _METHOD_ and the full length xlg cdnas were fused downstream or upstream of _METHOD_ . all constructs were driven by the constitutive cauliflower mosaic virus promoter and were constructed in a modified plasmid backbone with a nopaline synthase terminator . these constructs were transformed into v. faba leaves by biolistic bombardment as described by citation . after an overnight incubation of the leaves on wet filter paper under darkness abaxial epidermal peels were taken and _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was recorded under blue light illumination with an olympus bx digital microscope or with a zeiss lsm laser scanning confocal microscope . in order to identify t dna insertional mutants of the xlg genes we first screened both the alpha and _PROTEIN_ populations of the university of wisconsin s t dna insertional mutant collections . we also obtained t dna insertional lines from the salk collection through _PROTEIN_ the syngenta collection and the gabi kat collection . for the mutants used in this report _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are from the syngenta collection and _PROTEIN_ is from the salk collection . after identification of the t dna insertional mutant lines homozygous lines of these mutants were screened from progeny of the heterozygous mutant lines by pcr genotyping . for each specific t dna insertional mutant two sets of pcrs were performed using genomic dna as a template one with a gene specific primer and a t dna left border primer the second with two gene specific primers . the t dna left border primers and the two gene specific primers used for genotyping the three xlg mutant lines are listed in tables and . single mutant alleles _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were used to make crosses between two individual mutant lines . the generation of these crosses was allowed to self and three homozygous double mutants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were identified from the generation by pcr genotyping . the double mutants were used in further crosses for production of triple mutants . the progeny of these crosses were screened for triple mutants by pcr genotyping . the homozygous xlg triple mutant lines were obtained from different combinations of crosses between the double mutants and all of them showed the same phenotypes . a start codon and a nucleotide sequence encoding a _PROTEIN_ tag were fused in frame upstream of the _PROTEIN_ cdna . the fusion construct driven by the promoter was then subcloned into binary vector . the _PROTEIN_ cdna was subcloned upstream of the c terminal _PROTEIN_ tag of gateway cloning binary vector and the _PROTEIN_ cdna _METHOD_ construct was subcloned into gateway cloning binary vector . both the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ complementation constructs were also driven by the promoter . these three xlg complementation constructs were transformed into the xlg triple mutant and resulting transformants were used for complementation assays . seeds were surface sterilized and transferred to agar plates _METHOD_ with various treatments depending on the experiment . these plates were sealed with parafilm wrapped in aluminum foil and stored at for stratification for days before transfer to standard long day conditions in growth chambers . for growth in soil young seedlings were transplanted into soil after days of growth on agar plates . for growth assays on agar plates in darkness seeds were treated as above except plates were wrapped in aluminum foil with the exception of a h light treatment immediately after stratification to promote seed germination . for assays of aba effects on root growth seeds were first germinated and grown on agar plates _METHOD_ in darkness for days and then robust seedlings were transferred to treatment plates containing various concentrations of aba and grown in darkness for more days . for acc treatment assays seeds were planted on treatment plates directly and grown in darkness for weeks . for the effects of sugars on root length _METHOD_ media was supplemented with indicated concentrations of different sugars which were the sole source of sugar in the media . for each sugar col and xlg triple mutant seedlings were grown side by side on the same plates and root lengths were recorded after days of growth in darkness . each plate had seedlings per genotype and three duplicate plates were used for each assay . seed germination assays were performed essentially according to the method of citation in the presence of different concentrations of aba or in the presence of different sugars . ten day old seedlings of each mutant allele grown on agar plates under long day conditions were harvested and total rna was isolated from these plants using trizol reagent . for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ rt pcrs were performed using two sets of pcr primers one set of two pcr primers flanking or downstream of the t dna insertion the other set of two pcr primers upstream of the t dna insertion . amplification of served as a control . xlg transcript levels in the _PROTEIN_ mutant and the xlg triple mutant were assessed using quantitative real time rt pcr . real time rt pcr was performed as described by citation using as a housekeeping gene . primary roots of seedlings grown in darkness for weeks were incubated in for min . the stained samples were then observed under a zeiss lsm laser scanning confocal microscope . considering that cell size varies with developmental stage and between layers only root hair cells were measured so as to guarantee that all measured cells were mature cells from the same layer .
