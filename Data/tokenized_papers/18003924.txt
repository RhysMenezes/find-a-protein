cryptochrome blue light receptors mediate many aspects of plant photomorphogenesis such as suppression of hypocotyl elongation and promotion of cotyledon expansion and root growth . the cryptochrome _PROTEIN_ protein of arabidopsis is present in the _LOCATION_ and cytoplasm of cells but how the functions of one pool differ from the other is not known . _LOCATION_ localization and _LOCATION_ export signals were genetically engineered into _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ molecules to manipulate _PROTEIN_ subcellular localization in a _PROTEIN_ null mutant background . the effectiveness of the engineering was confirmed by confocal microscopy . the ability of _LOCATION_ or cytoplasmic _PROTEIN_ to rescue a variety of _PROTEIN_ phenotypes was determined . hypocotyl growth suppression by blue light was assessed by standard end point analyses and over time with high resolution by a custom computer vision technique . both assays indicated that _LOCATION_ rather than cytoplasmic _PROTEIN_ was the effective molecule in these growth inhibitions as was the case for the mechanistically linked _LOCATION_ depolarization which occurs within several seconds of _PROTEIN_ activation . petiole elongation also was inhibited by _LOCATION_ but not cytoplasmic _PROTEIN_ . conversely primary root growth and cotyledon expansion in blue light were promoted by cytoplasmic _PROTEIN_ and inhibited by _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ . anthocyanin production in response to blue light was strongly stimulated by _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ and to a lesser extent by cytoplasmic _PROTEIN_ . an important step toward elucidation of _PROTEIN_ signaling pathways is the recognition that different subcellular pools of the photoreceptor have different functions .
to visualize the _LOCATION_ versus cytoplasmic distribution of the _PROTEIN_ photoreceptor the dna coding sequence of _METHOD_ was attached to the n terminus of the _PROTEIN_ coding sequence . the n terminus was selected because previous work indicated that modifying the c terminus was likely to affect function . the decision to place the chimeric gene under the control of the promoter was based on the need for a strong _METHOD_ signal to visualize the low abundance _PROTEIN_ protein and the previous finding that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ by this strong promoter functions well without severe pleiotropic effects in the seedlings . to manipulate the cytoplasmic distribution of the _PROTEIN_ photoreceptor a _LOCATION_ localization signal or _LOCATION_ export signal used by matsushita et al . for a similar purpose was inserted between the _METHOD_ and the _PROTEIN_ coding sequences . not shown in fig ref a is the negative control construct in which arg of _PROTEIN_ was changed to lysine . previous studies showed that this mutation blocks function without affecting protein levels . the _PROTEIN_ allele previously demonstrated to lack _PROTEIN_ protein was transformed with these various constructs . fig ref b shows that in the root apex _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was present in both the cytoplasm and _LOCATION_ as reported before for the native protein . fig ref c shows that the _METHOD_ nls _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was concentrated in the _LOCATION_ and levels in the cytoplasm were below the detection limit . fig ref d shows that _METHOD_ nes _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ well in the cytoplasm but could not be detected in _LOCATION_ which were visualized by staining the roots with propidium iodide . essentially the same results were observed in cells of etiolated hypocotyls light grown hypocotyls and light grown cotyledons . these localization patterns were independent of blue light treatment . they represent the steady state levels of _PROTEIN_ in the different compartments but do not provide information about the rates of exchange between compartments . an analysis of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ intensity was performed to quantify the cytoplasmic and _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ levels in the root tips of plants _PROTEIN_ the different constructs . the results shown in fig ref a are consistent with the confocal images in that the nls sequence tag had a profound _LOCATION_ accumulation effect . the nes tag effectively excluded _PROTEIN_ from the _LOCATION_ . importantly the level of _PROTEIN_ in the _LOCATION_ of _PROTEIN_ plants was similar to the levels of _PROTEIN_ in the cytoplasm of _PROTEIN_ plants and the _PROTEIN_ situation was similar to the sum of the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ levels . at the tissue level rather than the subcellular level _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ levels in the three lines were similar in each of the organs studied . homozygous lines that faithfully _PROTEIN_ these desired subcellular _PROTEIN_ distributions in the generation were used to compare the extent to which _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ rescued the _PROTEIN_ defects in blue light responses . among the obvious changes in growth and shape that an etiolated seedling undergoes in response to light are suppression of hypocotyl elongation expansion of the cotyledons elongation of the cotyledon petioles and promotion of root elongation . the _PROTEIN_ photoreceptor participates in all of these responses so each was quantified in the different mutant and transgenic lines after days of growth in a range of blue photon fluence rates to determine whether _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ was as able to rescue the _PROTEIN_ defects more or less well as the _PROTEIN_ control . fig ref a shows that blue light suppressed hypocotyl elongation in wild type seedlings and that at the higher fluence rates of and _PROTEIN_ seedlings were fold taller than wild type . this iconic _PROTEIN_ phenotype was completely suppressed by _PROTEIN_ showing that the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ molecule was functional . the results obtained with the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ lines were unequivocal . complete suppression of the phenotype was observed in _PROTEIN_ seedlings however _PROTEIN_ was ineffective . therefore _LOCATION_ but not cytoplasmic _PROTEIN_ can explain the long term result of _PROTEIN_ action on hypocotyl growth in blue light . opposite to its effect on hypocotyl elongation blue light promoted cotyledon petiole elongation in wild type seedlings . the promotive effect of blue light was much greater in _PROTEIN_ than wild type indicating that _PROTEIN_ negatively regulates this photomorphogenic response which is presumably initiated by a different photoreceptor . suppression of the _PROTEIN_ long petioles beyond the wild type levels was achieved by _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ but _PROTEIN_ produced no suppression . some of the root growth promotion by blue light is because of _PROTEIN_ . fig ref c shows the root of _PROTEIN_ is shorter than wild type . shifting the distribution of _PROTEIN_ to the cytoplasm stimulated root growth at all fluence rates . conversely concentrating _PROTEIN_ in the _LOCATION_ inhibited root growth . the presence of _PROTEIN_ in both compartments _PROTEIN_ produced promotion at low fluence rates and inhibition at the higher fluence rates relative to the wild type . the _PROTEIN_ conclusion to draw from fig ref c is that _PROTEIN_ promotes root growth in blue light and that _PROTEIN_ has the opposite effect . blue light promotes cotyledon expansion by _PROTEIN_ signaling . the effect is evidenced here by the reduced cotyledon area of _PROTEIN_ seedlings grown in blue light especially at higher fluence rates . unlike the other processes presented in fig ref _PROTEIN_ was most effective at promoting cotyledon expansion and correcting the _PROTEIN_ defect . concentrating _PROTEIN_ in the _LOCATION_ and excluding it from the cytoplasm _PROTEIN_ prevented the photoreceptor from rescuing the mutation . as in roots _PROTEIN_ promoted cotyledon expansion relative to wild type _PROTEIN_ or the control line _PROTEIN_ which takes into account the effect of the promoter . the stimulatory effect of cytoplasmic _PROTEIN_ on cotyledon expansion is probably because of a true function of the photoreceptor disabling _PROTEIN_ function through the mutation _PROTEIN_ abolished its ability to modify any of the _PROTEIN_ phenotypes tested in any of the subcellular contexts . thus all of the effects in fig ref are more likely related to _PROTEIN_ signaling rather than indirect effects such as titrative reduction of interacting proteins or nonspecific interferences caused by extraordinary levels or locales of _PROTEIN_ . previous studies using high resolution tools designed for studying arabidopsis seedling growth demonstrated that growth inhibition induced by blue light is initiated not by _PROTEIN_ but by phototropin _PROTEIN_ an unrelated photoreceptor . after min of blue light irradiation a _PROTEIN_ mediated phase of growth inhibition replaces the _PROTEIN_ phase . the onset of the _PROTEIN_ phase but not the initial _PROTEIN_ phase has been mechanistically linked to an anion channel mediated depolarization of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ that is complete min after the onset of blue light irradiation . it seemed possible that some portions of these earliest effects of _PROTEIN_ on cell physiology and hypocotyl growth may be more dependent on cytoplasmic _PROTEIN_ than _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ . therefore electrophysiology and the _PROTEIN_ computer vision technique for measuring hypocotyl growth from time series of electronic images were used to investigate the functions of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . fig ref shows that the _LOCATION_ depolarization defect of _PROTEIN_ was not rescued by _PROTEIN_ but was completely rescued by _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . if _PROTEIN_ mediates the depolarization and the depolarization is causal to the onset of _PROTEIN_ dependent growth inhibition then both should be rescued by the same form of _PROTEIN_ . if the ionic events are rescued by one form and the growth response by the other the two will have been uncoupled . hypocotyl growth rates were determined by using the morphometric _METHOD_ developed by miller et al . . the abrupt escape from inhibition after min of irradiation typical of _PROTEIN_ was not corrected by _PROTEIN_ . however _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ completely restored wild type growth inhibition to _PROTEIN_ . thus the electrophysiological results and high resolution growth measurements are consistent with the model that rapid ionic responses to blue light and the subsequent _PROTEIN_ mediated phase of growth inhibition are causally connected and both mediated by _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ . variations of this conclusion are considered in discussion . anthocyanin pigments accumulate in arabidopsis seedlings in response to light primarily through a _PROTEIN_ dependent blue light pathway . genes in the biosynthetic pathway are up regulated in a _PROTEIN_ dependent manner . however noh and spalding found that a posttranslational step involving _PROTEIN_ dependent anion channel activation was required for proper anthocyanin accumulation . to test the possibility that this complexity was the result of combinations of _LOCATION_ and cytoplasmic _PROTEIN_ activities anthocyanin accumulation in the transgenic lines grown in blue light was measured . as expected _PROTEIN_ seedlings were unable to accumulate anthocyanin . wild type anthocyanin levels were restored by _PROTEIN_ but _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were much more potent promoting anthocyanin accumulation at least fold higher than the wild type level .
to generate the chimeric fusion construct _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ the complete _PROTEIN_ coding sequence was amplified by pcr from an arabidopsis cdna clone _PROTEIN_ by using a forward primer ggctcgagtctggttctgtatctggttgtggttc and a reverse primer ggctcgagttacccggtttgtgaaagccgtctcc . the italicized regions denote xhoi sites that were introduced to both primers to facilitate the cloning of amplified dna . to introduce nls or nes signal peptide dna into the construct the forward primers ggctcgagcctaagaagaagagaaaggtttctggttctgtatctggttgtggttc or ggctcgagcttgctcttaagttggctggacttgatatttctggttctgtatctggttgtggttc respectively were used . the signal sequences are shown in lowercase . after digestion with xhoi the fragment was fused in frame to the c terminal end of _METHOD_ in pegad vector . a point mutation in the _PROTEIN_ coding region that substitutes arg with a lysine residue in the protein sequence was previously shown to create a protein that accumulates normally but has no detectable function . this point mutation was introduced into the cdna clone _PROTEIN_ by a quikchange ii site directed mutagenesis kit by using the primers ccagaatttaatatcaaaattgttgcagagagc and _PROTEIN_ . the resulting plasmid was used as the template to clone the mutated _PROTEIN_ cdna with nls or nes tag into pegad as described before . the mutated nonfunctional _PROTEIN_ produced is designated _PROTEIN_ . the resulting constructs were introduced into agrobacterium tumefaciens and used to transform _PROTEIN_ mutant plants by using the floral dip method . plants carrying the transgene were isolated through basta selection . the homozygous lines for the transgene were obtained in the generation . a. thaliana ecotype columbia was used as a wild type in all experiments . seeds were surface sterilized with ethanol and plated on half strength murashige and skoog agar plates _METHOD_ . the plates were _PROTEIN_ in darkness at for days and then placed under various intensities of constant blue light at for days . to quantify growth rates seedlings were rearranged on agar plates and images were obtained with a flatbed scanner . hypocotyls petioles primary roots and the cotyledon area were determined by using national institutes of health _PROTEIN_ software . confocal microscopy was performed with a zeiss lsm laser scanning confocal microscope equipped with a meta detector . propidium iodide was used to stain the _LOCATION_ and the cell wall to delineate the root structure . vybrant dyecycle orange stain was used to stain the _LOCATION_ in the hypocotyl and cotyledon . either a c apochromat water immersion lens or a plan apochromat oil immersion lens was used . the sample was excited with the nm laser line from a mw argon gas laser . the _METHOD_ was captured in nm bandwidths and then linear unmixing was performed to isolate the _METHOD_ signal from the stained or endogenous _METHOD_ background . mean _METHOD_ intensities were calculated within manually selected regions of interest with zeiss lsm software . in the primary root _LOCATION_ a circular area of covering the whole _LOCATION_ was selected . one representative _LOCATION_ per root was recorded and the values reported are the means of at least four separate roots . for the cytoplasmic values a field of similar size adjacent to the _LOCATION_ was chosen . to measure overall _METHOD_ intensity in the different organs regions of for the root for the hypocotyl for the petiole and for the cotyledon were used . seedlings were days old . two day old seedlings grown in the dark on agar containing mm kcl and mm were used to measure hypocotyl growth with a recently developed computer vision method . briefly electronic images acquired at min intervals by ccd cameras using infrared light were analyzed with custom morphometric _METHOD_ designed to extract information such as growth rate . hypocotyl inhibition was induced by blue light . four day old etiolated seedlings grown on agar containing mm kcl and mm were used to measure surface potential induced by a pulse of blue light as described previously except that the xenon arc light source and delivery mechanism were those used by folta et al . . anthocyanin measurement was conducted according to a previously published method . seven day old seedlings grown under blue light were harvested from the agar plates quickly weighed and placed into microcentrifuge tubes containing of propanol hcl and water . the tubes were placed in boiling water for min and then incubated in darkness overnight at room temperature . after a brief centrifugation to pellet the tissue of the solution was removed and brought to a final volume of by adding solvent . the amount of anthocyanins in the resulting extract was quantified spectrophotometrically . the values are reported as per gram of fresh weight .
