the cell wall _METHOD_ the first line of interaction between the plant and the external environment . based on the observation that vtc mutants of arabidopsis thaliana have increased cell wall peroxidase activity the cell wall glycoproteome of _PROTEIN_ was investigated . glycoproteins were purified from fully expanded leaves by concanavalin a affinity chromatography and analysed by liquid chromatography quadrupole _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . this procedure identified proteins with predicted glycosylation sites and cell wall localization . of these proteins were differentially _PROTEIN_ between _PROTEIN_ and wild type . in particular _PROTEIN_ were identified as contributing to increased peroxidase activity in response to ascorbate deficiency . this is the same peroxidase previously shown to contribute to hydrogen peroxide generation and pathogen resistance . three arabinogalactan proteins _PROTEIN_ had lower abundance in _PROTEIN_ . inspection of published microarray data shows that these also have lower gene _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and are _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ by pathogen _PROTEIN_ and oxidative stresses . ascorbate deficiency therefore impacts _PROTEIN_ of cell wall proteins involved in pathogen responses and these presumably contribute to the increased resistance of vtc mutants to biotrophic pathogens .
to extract samples enriched in ionically bound cell wall proteins the pellet from homogenized leaves was eluted with . this treatment displaces ionically bound proteins from the pellet producing a supernatant that is enriched in cell wall enzymes such as type iii peroxidase . peroxidase activity using pyrogallol as substrate was significantly higher in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and than wild type when the plants were grown in low light . activity was not significantly higher in _PROTEIN_ in the current experiments although it has been previously reported to be higher in this mutant . under these growth conditions apoplastic ascorbate was significantly lower in _PROTEIN_ and . growth in high light _PROTEIN_ increased peroxidase activity in all genotypes by approximately twofold and abolished differences between genotypes . protein concentration of the ionically bound protein fraction did not differ between genotypes and was marginally greater in _PROTEIN_ . peroxidase activity is therefore higher in vtc mutants when grown under normal laboratory lighting but this effect is swamped under light intensities closer to the natural environment . the arabidopsis genome encodes type iii peroxidases which are largely predicted to be targeted to the apoplast or _LOCATION_ . therefore a _METHOD_ _METHOD_ proteomics approach was taken to discover which of these proteins are responsible for the increased peroxidase activity in plants . proteins were isolated from pellets of fully expanded rosette leaf homogenates by eluting with and licl followed by affinity purification of the eluate by cona affinity chromatography . this method should provide a fraction enriched in glycoproteins that are ionically bound to the cell wall . approximately peptides were detected in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ after deconvolution by progenesis _METHOD_ . of these provided _METHOD_ spectra for peptide identification from which a total of unique proteins represented by two or more peptides were identified from _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ grown under ll and _PROTEIN_ . their predicted intracellular locations were determined and overall were predicted to be _LOCATION_ secreted or associated with the endomembrane system . therefore this method provides significant enrichment in cell wall proteins . the glycoproteins identified are shown in table . the identified proteins are mostly predicted to be and are dominated by hydrolases proteases peroxidases lectins _PROTEIN_ and kinases . a detailed quantitative proteomic investigation focused on a comparison of and _PROTEIN_ . the relative _PROTEIN_ of identified peptides based on their _METHOD_ peak areas normalized to the median of all peptides was calculated using progenesis _METHOD_ software . peptides were bundled into their cognate proteins and the sum of the peaks areas of unique peptides for each protein was used to calculate relative protein abundance . overall and peptides were significantly different across strain and light comparisons . twelve cell wall proteins were identified as being significantly different between and _PROTEIN_ . of these five were consistently more abundant in _PROTEIN_ than in in both ll and _PROTEIN_ a lectin two type iii peroxidases _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ a kinase and an aspartyl protease . among the proteins with lower abundance in _PROTEIN_ were three _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . a protein _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ acclimated wild type and _PROTEIN_ plants but was higher in the compared with _PROTEIN_ in l and _PROTEIN_ . the abundance of individual peptides for the closely related _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are shown in table . since only one peptide is specific to _PROTEIN_ and six peptides are common to both proteins it is not possible to conclude which of these two are more affected in _PROTEIN_ . many cell wall proteins contain hydroxyproline which provides a site for glycosylation . ascorbate is required for _PROTEIN_ the activity of prolyl hydroxylases during proline hydroxylation so it is possible that glycoprotein abundance is affected by a limitation on proline hydroxylation in the vtc mutants . to assess this possibility proline and hydroxyproline were measured after hydrolysing crude cell wall preparations . of proline residues were hydroxylated reflecting the postulated large proportion of proteins in the cell wall . there was no significant difference between strains .
