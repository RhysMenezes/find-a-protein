_PROTEIN_ proteins have been implicated in synthesis or repair of iron/sulfur clusters in all domains of life and those of bacteria animals and protists have been shown to require a tetrahydrofolate to function . two _PROTEIN_ proteins were identified in arabidopsis and many other plants one related to those of proteobacteria and predicted to be mitochondrial the other related to those of cyanobacteria and predicted to be _LOCATION_ . grasses and poplar appear to lack the latter . the predicted subcellular locations of the arabidopsis proteins were validated by in vitro import assays with purified pea organelles and by targeting assays in arabidopsis and tobacco protoplasts using green _METHOD_ protein fusions . the protein was shown to be _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in flowers siliques and seeds whereas the protein was _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in young leaves . the folate dependence of both arabidopsis proteins was established by functional complementation of an escherichia coli _PROTEIN_ deletant both plant genes restored in vivo activity of the fe/s enzyme miab but restoration was abrogated when folates were eliminated by deleting folp . insertional inactivation of was embryo lethal this phenotype was reversed by genetic complementation of the mutant . these data establish that _PROTEIN_ proteins have a folate dependent function in mitochondria and _LOCATION_ and that the mitochondrial protein is essential . that plants retain mitochondrial and _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ proteins with distinct phylogenetic origins emphasizes how deeply the extant fe/s cluster assembly machinery still reflects the ancient endosymbioses that gave rise to plants .
as noted above the arabidopsis genome encodes two _PROTEIN_ proteins and either of which can functionally replace e. coli _PROTEIN_ . both arabidopsis proteins have n terminal extensions relative to their bacterial homologues these extensions are predicted to target to mitochondria and to _LOCATION_ . both arabidopsis proteins have orthologues in many land plants as judged by tblastn searches of genome and est databases so that arabidopsis is a representative model to study _PROTEIN_ in plants . primary structure phylogeny and distribution of plant _PROTEIN_ proteins . amino acid sequence alignment of and a close bacterial homologue of each . residues conserved in all four sequences are in red those conserved only in and rickettsia are in black and those conserved only in and

_PROTEIN_ selaginella moellendorfii moss physcomitrella patens . phylogenetic analysis of _PROTEIN_ proteins from plants yeast mouse and diverse bacteria showed that and its plant orthologues fall into the same clade as rickettsia and other proteobacteria which are the closest living relatives of the mitochondrial progenitor . this clade also contained the yeast and mouse _PROTEIN_ proteins which have both been shown to be mitochondrial . conversely and its counterparts in other plants are in the same clade as proteins from cyanobacteria the group that gave rise to _LOCATION_ . these clades are referred to here as mitochondrial and _LOCATION_ respectively . alignment of the sequences of the arabidopsis proteins with their closest bacterial homologues underscores the marked divergence between mitochondrial and _LOCATION_ type proteins . while there is substantial overall sequence identity within each type there is little identity between the types outside the _PROTEIN_ signature motif kgc x gqe x r. although many plant genomes encode both _PROTEIN_ proteins some seem to lack the _LOCATION_ type . those without this type include poplar and all grasses for which genome sequences and/or deep est collections exist . est evidence indicates that a _LOCATION_ type protein occurs in other monocots for example onion . the subcellular location of the two arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ proteins was investigated first using dual import assays in which radiolabelled full length translation products are incubated with a mixture of purified chloroplasts and mitochondria . in reactions with mitochondria contained a labelled product that was smaller than the full length precursor and resistant to attack by thermolysin as expected for a translocated protein but no thermolysin resistant protein was present in chloroplasts . conversely in reactions with chloroplasts contained a smaller thermolysin resistant product but mitochondria did not . to complement this approach subcellular localization was analysed in tobacco by protoplasts and arabidopsis protoplasts using fusions between the n terminus of each _PROTEIN_ protein and _METHOD_ . _PROTEIN_ of the _METHOD_ fusion in by cells resulted in a punctate pattern of _METHOD_ matching that of the mitotracker mitochondrial marker . in contrast the _METHOD_ fusion _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis cells gave larger punctate _METHOD_ areas that coincided with chlorophyll _METHOD_ . thus both in vitro and in vivo approaches indicate that as predicted the protein is targeted to mitochondria and the protein is targeted to chloroplasts . high throughput proteomic data also support a chloroplastic location for . organellar targeting and _PROTEIN_ of arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ proteins . protein import into isolated pea chloroplasts and mitochondria . full length and sequences were translated in vitro in the presence of leucine . the translation products were incubated for min or min in the light with mixed chloroplasts and mitochondria which were then separated on an percoll gradient without or with prior thermolysin treatment to remove adsorbed proteins . proteins were separated by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and visualized by fluorography . samples were loaded on the basis of equal chlorophyll or mitochondrial protein content next to aliquots of the respective translation products . the molecular _METHOD_ of the full length proteins are indicated . top panels transient _PROTEIN_ in tobacco by protoplasts of _METHOD_ fused to the predicted targeting sequence of . bottom panels transient _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis protoplasts of _METHOD_ fused to the predicted targeting sequence of . _METHOD_ mitotracker and chlorophyll _METHOD_ were observed by _METHOD_ microscopy . cells were observed by differential interference contrast microscopy . scale bars . immunoblot analysis of and _PROTEIN_ in selected arabidopsis organs . lanes contained of protein blots were probed with antiserum to or or with pre immune serum . pre immune serum gave no signals . samples were from day old whole seedlings roots from hydroponic culture rosette leaves from plants at d and d old _METHOD_ flowers siliques at early mid _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ stages of development and dry seeds . and protein levels were analysed by immunoblotting using rabbit antisera . protein was most abundant in flowers siliques and dry seeds with cleavage products detectable in the latter samples . protein was most abundant in young leaves . these results agree broadly with transcriptome data which show that mrna is most strongly _PROTEIN_ in flowers pollen and seeds whereas mrna is _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in green tissues . the folate requirement of _PROTEIN_ can be established using a heterologous e. coli system in which the fe/s enzyme miab serves as an in vivo reporter of _PROTEIN_ activity . miab mediates the conversion of isopentenyladenosine in trna to methylthio isopentenyladenosine _METHOD_ its in vivo activity can thus be gauged from the _METHOD_ ratio in trna . as e. coli miab activity depends strongly on the action of _PROTEIN_ the _METHOD_ ratio is a sensitive measure of _PROTEIN_ function . this ratio is > in wild type e. coli cells but can drop to < when the gene encoding _PROTEIN_ is deleted . evidence that and require folate for activity in vivo . the reaction catalysed by the trna modification enzyme miab and the relationship between miab the _PROTEIN_ protein and folate . miab has two clusters which are depicted schematically . lc _METHOD_ quantification of and

independent samples . to test folate dependence of the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ proteins each was _PROTEIN_ from a plasmid in an e.coli ygfz deletant strain . as expected from the observation that and both complement the growth phenotypes of this strain they both gave high _METHOD_ ratios in the wild type range . however when the folp gene was also deleted the ratios were < . since strains completely lack folates this result indicates that the action of both arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ proteins requires folate as has been shown for animal and protist _PROTEIN_ proteins . a t dna mutant carrying a single insertion in exon of was identified in the gabi kat collection the insertion interrupts the open reading frame residues upstream of the c terminus . the selfed progeny of heterozygotes contained only wild type and heterozygous individuals and segregated for the _PROTEIN_ resistance marker in a ratio . these observations both point to embryo lethality . consistent with embryo lethality immature siliques of heterozygous plants contained aborted seeds at about one quarter of the positions such defective seeds were absent from wild type siliques . to confirm that the lethal phenotype is due to ablation of heterozygous mutants were transformed with a genomic clone of that included bp of upstream promoter sequence . the selfed progeny of transformants included
