under saline conditions higher plants restrict the accumulation of chloride ions in the shoot by regulating their transfer from the root symplast into the xylem associated apoplast . to identify molecular _METHOD_ underpinning this phenomenon we undertook a transcriptional screen of salt stressed arabidopsis roots . microarrays quantitative rt pcr and promoter gus fusions identified a candidate gene involved in cl xylem loading from the nitrate transporter transporter family . this gene was highly _PROTEIN_ in the root stele compared to the cortex and its _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ after exposure to nacl or abscisic acid . fused to _METHOD_ proteins _PROTEIN_ either transiently or stably was targeted to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . electrophysiological analysis of in xenopus laevis oocytes suggested that catalyzed passive cl efflux out of cells and was much less permeable to . shoot cl accumulation was _PROTEIN_ following artificial microrna knockdown whereas it was increased by overexpression of . taken together these results suggest that is involved in long distance transport of cl in plants playing a role in the loading and the regulation of cl loading into the xylem of arabidopsis roots during salinity stress .
based on accumulated physiological evidence it was hypothesized that the rate limiting step of cl loading to the shoot is in the root stele and is ultimately regulated by transcription of genes encoding cl transporters . previously a comparative transcriptomic analysis of pericycle and cortical cells in the root of arabidopsis in response to salt had been conducted using _METHOD_ activated cell sorting and affymetrix microarrays . the data were subsequently reanalyzed to identify stelar _PROTEIN_ genes that were likely to encode _LOCATION_ bound anion permeable transport proteins that had their _PROTEIN_ reduced by salt stress . two candidates were identified that satisfied these criteria from this preliminary screen the known h symporter _PROTEIN_ which regulates transfer to arabidopsis shoots and an uncharacterized gene _GENE_ which was annotated as a proton dependent oligo peptide transporter . we prioritized the uncharacterized gene for further study . was preferentially _PROTEIN_ in the stele compared to the cortex _PROTEIN_ and was down regulated by salt _PROTEIN_ . a search of the gene _PROTEIN_ omnibus profiles database revealed that was rapidly down regulated in the root after exposure to salt in other studies _PROTEIN_ . belongs to the nitrate excretion transporter subfamily of the nitrate transporter transporter _PROTEIN_ family in arabidopsis . the naxt subfamily consists of seven genes which are clustered on chromosome . the naxt subfamily was so named after the properties of _PROTEIN_ a transporter in root cortical cells involved in excretion from the root . the candidate gene harbors four exons and three introns and is predicted to encode a amino acid protein consisting of transmembrane helices with a hydrophilic loop between transmembrane helices and . the protein sequence of was found to have a identity and a similarity to _PROTEIN_ and a identity and a similarity to a selective xylem loader in arabidopsis root . a three dimensional molecular model of was constructed using crystal structures of a proton dependent oligo peptide transporter from shewanella oneidensis and a structure of the _PROTEIN_ h transporter from arabidopsis in complex with a ion . the putative structure of derived through use of both structural templates indicated the presence of a central cavity which was common to both structural templates . the presence of cl ions could be simulated and several residues including tyr val asn and met were identified in as important in forming a potential cavity essential for anion transport activity . this provides an additional basis for further study of as a candidate for transporting cl between roots and shoots . _PROTEIN_ profiling by quantitative rt pcr indicated that both nacl and aba treatment significantly reduced the transcript abundance of . the reduction in gene _PROTEIN_ was found to be concentration dependent with mm nacl treatment reducing transcript abundance more than mm nacl . when treated with mm nacl for d the abundance of mrna in the roots was significantly reduced by almost when compared with untreated plants . exposure to aba for or h significantly reduced transcripts in the roots with the reduction increasing over the time of the assay . to examine the localization of _PROTEIN_ kb of the putative promoter sequence of was used to drive the _PROTEIN_ of the uida reporter gene . compared to nontransformed columbia plants driven gus activity was detected in the cells associated with the root vascular bundle in both primary and _PROTEIN_ roots of plants transformed with uida . gus activity was also detectible in the vascular cells of both cotyledons and true leaves . transverse sections of d old uida _PROTEIN_ roots further demonstrated gus activity in the root stelar cells . driven gus activity was also detected in flower and developing siliques . to investigate the responsiveness of the promoter to salt stress uida plants were treated with or mm nacl for d on murashige and skoog _METHOD_ plates . a reduction in the intensity of associated gus activity was observed in response to salt treatments . a _METHOD_ based methylumelliferyl galactopyranoside assay quantified that uida plants treated with or mm nacl for d had approximately and gus activity respectively when compared with mm nacl grown plants . the kb putative promoter region of was compared with the entries of the plant cis acting regulatory dna elements . multiple copies of binding sites that are targets of transcription _PROTEIN_ belonging to aba signal transduction pathways were identified . to determine the subcellular localization of col plants were stably transformed with _METHOD_ fused to the end of . _METHOD_ was detected on the periphery of root cells in the d old transgenic plants . after plasmolysis was performed to detach the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ from the cell wall _METHOD_ was detected on hechtian strands . to further verify the localization _METHOD_ was fused to the end of and transiently _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis mesophyll protoplasts . figure c to f shows that associated _METHOD_ _METHOD_ overlapped with the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ marker _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . to test whether was able to facilitate cl transport two electrode voltage clamping of x. laevis oocytes injected with crna was performed . when the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ of crna injected oocytes was clamped at a negative _LOCATION_ potential an inward current was induced in the presence of external cl which was consistent with the efflux of anions from the oocytes into the _LOCATION_ medium through . to examine whether cl transport activity of was affected by h concentration oocytes were incubated in mm cl at ph values of either or . no ph dependency of the inward current was observed . the magnitude of inward current carried by and cl was compared in injected oocytes and controls and it was shown that negative currents were much larger and conductance was higher when cl was the external anion rather than the pcl permeability ratio of was calculated to be . to distinguish whether the observed inward currents at negative _LOCATION_ potentials were associated with movements of cl or na oocytes preinjected with crna or water were incubated in the solutions having a constant concentration of na with increasing concentrations of cl and the inward currents observed were larger when increased cl concentration in the external solution . when using solutions that have a constant concentration of cl with increasing concentrations of na similar association between external na concentrations and the size of inward currents was observed . the effect of different cations on the stimulation of cl carrying currents was examined and found not to be na specific k also stimulated cl carrying currents whereas n methyl d _PROTEIN_ and did not . when na was present in the absence of cl no detectible currents were observed . to test if na is only activating the transport of cl by not being cotransported with cl elemental content of cl na and k was measured in both crna and water injected oocytes incubated in _PROTEIN_ solution for d with and without a h low nacl treatment . crna injected oocytes had a significantly lower cl level compared with water injected controls . no significant difference was observed in na content or k content between crna injected oocytes and water injected controls . to test whether the observed outward currents at positive _LOCATION_ potentials were due to cl entering the cell through a unidirectional influx assay for and water injected oocytes was performed by incubation in solutions containing mm nacl or mm nmdg cl _PROTEIN_ with low activities of for min . oocytes injected with crna exhibited significantly greater uptake of than the water injected oocytes in presence of nacl . this stimulated influx was not affected by changes in ph values of and . when nacl was replaced with nmdg cl there was not a significant increase in the uptake of in crna injected oocytes compared to water injected controls at both ph values tested . a unidirectional na uptake assay using oocytes incubated in mm nacl solution _PROTEIN_ with confirmed that there was no transmembrane movement of na through . putative t dna knockouts were ordered from stock centers but no plants containing an insert within and/or lacking _PROTEIN_ could be identified . therefore to elucidate the function of in planta artificial micrornas were designed to knock down _PROTEIN_ . these were transformed into col plants . qrt pcr showed that amirna plants had lower transcript abundance of compared with the null segregants . these amirna plants were shown to have significantly less cl in the shoot when grown under a low salt conditions . meanwhile shoot content as well as na and k remained similar between knockdown lines and null segregants . under a high salt load when the endogenous _PROTEIN_ ordinarily _PROTEIN_ in such conditions the transcript abundance of in the amirna knockdown lines and null segregants was at a similar low level and no significant difference in shoot cl concentration was found . transcript levels of the closest homolog of were found to be unaffected in the root of knockdown lines when compared with null segregants . to investigate the effect of constitutive overexpression of on shoot cl accumulation was constitutively overexpressed in col plants under the control of a promoter . two independent overexpression lines were grown for weeks in hydroponics before being exposed to or mm nacl for d. greater mrna levels were observed in both overexpression lines as detected by qrt pcr . after the mm nacl treatment cl accumulation in the shoot was higher in both overexpression lines compared to the null segregants with oex exhibiting a significant increase of . at the same time no significant difference in shoot content of was found between the transgenic lines and null segregants . small but nonsignificant increases in shoot cl accumulation were observed in overexpression lines grown in mm nacl while no alternation in shoot content of was observed .
