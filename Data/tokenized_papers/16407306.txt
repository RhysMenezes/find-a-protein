functional characterization of arabidopsis thaliana _PROTEIN_ in heterologous _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ i.e . saccharomyces cerevisiae and xenopus laevis oocytes revealed that codes for an h driven high affinity aminobutyric acid transporter . in addition to gaba other aminofatty acids and butylamine are recognized . in contrast to the most closely related proteins of the proline transporter family proline and glycine betaine are not transported by . does not share sequence similarity with any of the non plant gaba transporters described so far and analyses of substrate selectivity and kinetic properties showed that mediated transport is similar but distinct from that of mammalian bacterial and s. cerevisiae gaba transporters . consistent with a role in gaba uptake into cells transient _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ protein fusion proteins in tobacco protoplasts revealed localization at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . in planta _PROTEIN_ was highest in flowers and under conditions of elevated gaba concentrations such as wounding or senescence .
the arabidopsis genome contains two members of the _PROTEIN_ amino acid transporter gene family _GENE_ and _GENE_ which exhibit a higher degree of homology to the proline/compatible solute transporters than to members of other subfamilies . interestingly showed higher homology to a rice protein than to its closest arabidopsis homolog _GENE_ . similarly _GENE_ showed highest homology to a partial mrna from _PROTEIN_ and to two rice proteins . this is in contrast to members of the prot subfamily where proteins from tomato mangrove rice and arabidopsis display a higher degree of homology within a species than between species . similar to predictions for other _PROTEIN_ family members and _GENE_ encode proteins with a molecular _METHOD_ of and kda respectively and predicted transmembrane domains . based on the relatively low sequence identity of and _GENE_ to prots we wondered whether the newly identified genes code for compatible solute transporters or represent a separate group of amino acid transporters . transports gaba with high determine whether differs in its substrate specificity from members of the prot gene family the cdnas of and _GENE_ were isolated by rt pcr . subsequently and _GENE_ were _PROTEIN_ under the control of the strong _PROTEIN_ promoter _PROTEIN_ in the s. cerevisiae strain . the s. cerevisiae mutant carries mutations in the general amino acid proline _PROTEIN_ and gaba permeases and therefore is unable to grow on citrulline proline or gaba as the sole nitrogen source . as control strain was transformed with the _PROTEIN_ vector _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ harboring the cdnas of the proline/compatible solute transporter _PROTEIN_ or of the amino acid permease . growth under selective conditions showed that like _PROTEIN_ was able to mediate growth on gaba . however could not mediate growth on proline or citrulline and histidine was not a substrate for . this behavior distinguished from all transporters of the _PROTEIN_ family characterized so far . in contrast _GENE_ could not mediate growth on any of the tested substrates . therefore _GENE_ was not included in further functional studies . previous studies described the prots as low affinity gaba transporters . to examine whether differed in its kinetic properties gaba uptake experiments were performed in cells _PROTEIN_ . transport assays showed that has a much higher affinity for gaba than any of the plant transporters characterized before . as shown for other transporters of the _PROTEIN_ family transport rates increased with _PROTEIN_ ph . competition experiments for gaba uptake in the presence of a fold excess of competitors showed that the gaba related compounds aminobutyric acid and alanine reduced gaba transport rates by whereas aminobutyric acid did not compete for gaba transport . in addition compounds involved in gaba metabolism were not competitors for mediated gaba uptake . alanine slightly reduced gaba transport rates whereas histidine as well as compounds that were good competitors for prot mediated gaba transport did not reduce gaba uptake activity . that none of the substrates tested efficiently competed for gaba uptake suggested that is a highly selective high affinity gaba transporter . electrophysiological assay of gaba transport determine whether weakly competing compounds were substrates of and to examine the kinetic properties of in more detail substrate induced currents were analyzed in x. laevis oocytes injected with crna . at a _LOCATION_ potential of mv and a ph of addition of mm gaba to the bathing medium of _PROTEIN_ oocytes induced inward currents ranging from to na . current amplitude was dependent on the batch of oocytes and incubation time after crna injection . as is commonly observed with many other electrogenic transporters _PROTEIN_ in x. laevis oocytes the substrate evoked current reached a peak followed by slow decay in the presence of the substrate . no gaba evoked currents were observed in control oocytes . fig . shows the gaba activation curve at a holding potential of mv and an external proton concentration of . the apparent affinity of for gaba was . likewise the h activation curve at mv and mm gaba was hyperbolic with a of nm . the apparent affinity for gaba appeared not to be voltage dependent in the range from to mv whereas the maximum transport rate increased slightly at depolarized _LOCATION_ potentials . substrate selectivity of studies such as those shown in fig . demonstrate whether a compound can alter mediated gaba transport presumably by competing for the gaba binding site of . however these competition studies do not reveal whether a tested compound is in _PROTEIN_ a transported substrate of . thus to further examine the substrate selectivity of electrophysiological assays were performed . gaba gaba analogs and other substrates were applied at a concentration of mm whereas out was and vm was mv . an inward current evoked by a substrate was taken as h driven mediated substrate translocation into the cell . l alanine aminobutyric acid and alanine which only weakly competed for gaba uptake in s. cerevisiae induced inward currents comparable in magnitude with that induced by gaba . other gaba related compounds with longer _PROTEIN_ chains such as aminovaleric acid aminocaproic acid and aminocaprylic acid were also good substrates . interestingly the current induced by butylamine which lacks the _PROTEIN_ group was similar to that induced by gaba . none of these substrates induced currents in control oocytes . similar to competition experiments using s. cerevisiae d and l proline as well as glycine betaine and choline were not recognized as substrates . in addition substrates of the gaba shunt did not induce currents in _PROTEIN_ oocytes . moreover trigonelline a betaine present at high concentrations in many legume seeds and the amino acids histidine glutamine and norvaline were not transported . the rigid gaba analog nipecotic acid and the amino sulfonate taurine both substrates of neuronal gaba transporters in mouse did not induce currents in _PROTEIN_ oocytes . we reasoned that the compounds that did not compete for gaba uptake in s. cerevisiae but induced currents in _PROTEIN_ oocytes were low affinity substrates of . thus we determined the affinity of for various substrates . substrate induced currents were measured during applications of substrates at concentrations between and mm . currents were plotted against the substrate concentration and curves were fitted to equation . the apparent affinity of for individual substrates varied by a _PROTEIN_ of . showed the highest affinity for butylamine with a fold lower than that for gaba . moving the amino group closer to the _PROTEIN_ group progressively reduced the apparent affinity . increasing the _PROTEIN_ chain backbone from gaba to aminocaprylic acid only marginally affected the values . in addition aminolevulinic acid was transported with an affinity comparable with that of gaba . reducing the _PROTEIN_ chain length resulted in a much lower substrate affinity . a similar affinity was determined for aminophenylacetic acid a peptide mimic lacking a peptide bond . for compounds with even shorter _PROTEIN_ chains the affinity dropped even further . the apparent affinity for l glycine and l aminobutyric acid which had been shown to induce currents in _PROTEIN_ oocytes as well as for l diaminobutyric acid and the dipeptide glycyl glycine was > mm . although the values of the different substrates varied considerably the maximum transport rate for all substrates remained relatively constant . is localized at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ complementation of the s. cerevisiae gaba transport mutant by and functional _PROTEIN_ in x. laevis oocytes showed that at least a fraction of the protein is targeted to and localized at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ in both heterologous _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . to assess its cellular localization in planta fusion proteins of and _METHOD_ were transiently _PROTEIN_ in tobacco protoplasts under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus promoter . _METHOD_ images obtained by confocal laser scanning microscopy showed that the signal from the _METHOD_ fusion protein was present as a single _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ at the periphery of the protoplast suggestive of its localization at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . in addition the protoplasts showed some _METHOD_ _METHOD_ on internal _LOCATION_ . similar results were obtained for the _METHOD_ fusion . free _METHOD_ localized to the _LOCATION_ . when _PROTEIN_ in xenopus oocytes both fusion proteins _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ were able to mediate gaba transport with affinities comparable with that of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis is induced by wounding and during _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis was extremely weak and hardly detectable by rna gel blot analysis . relative quantification using real time pcr with the actin mrna as a reference demonstrated the highest levels of _PROTEIN_ in flowers and low _PROTEIN_ levels in roots leaves and _METHOD_ . microarray analyses showed that in flowers _PROTEIN_ is highest in sepals lower in _PROTEIN_ and carpels and very low in stamen . in agreement with our own data only low transcript levels were found in pollen . it was shown previously that gaba accumulates under various stress conditions . however cold heat and anoxia did not significantly alter mrna levels . mechanical wounding caused a transient increase of transcript levels that dropped below control values after h . a similar time course of _PROTEIN_ after wounding has been observed in microarray analyses _PROTEIN_ . interestingly _PROTEIN_ also increased during leaf senescence of both detached and naturally senescing leaves corresponding to results obtained in microarray analyses . differences in induction during dark induced and natural senescence might result from impaired export of compounds in detached leaves or may reflect differences in _PROTEIN_ nitrogen ratio as described for other genes . in both experiments the increase in _PROTEIN_ correlates with an increase in gaba content in the corresponding tissue .
