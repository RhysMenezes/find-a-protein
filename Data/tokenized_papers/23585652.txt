very long chain fatty acids with chain lengths from to _PROTEIN_ are involved in diverse biological functions such as _LOCATION_ constituents a surface barrier and seed storage compounds . the first step in vlcfa biosynthesis is the condensation of two _PROTEIN_ to an acyl coenzyme a which is catalyzed by ketoacyl coenzyme a synthase . in this study amino acid sequence homology and the messenger rna _PROTEIN_ patterns of arabidopsis kcss were compared . the in planta role of the _PROTEIN_ gene showing higher _PROTEIN_ in stem epidermal peels than in _METHOD_ was further investigated . the _PROTEIN_ gene was ubiquitously _PROTEIN_ in various organs and tissues including roots leaves and _METHOD_ including epidermis silique walls sepals the upper portion of the styles and seed coats but not in developing embryos . the _METHOD_ signals of the _PROTEIN_ enhanced yellow _METHOD_ protein construct were merged with those of monomeric red _METHOD_ protein which is an _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ marker in tobacco epidermal cells . the _PROTEIN_ knockout mutants exhibited a significant reduction in _PROTEIN_ vlcfas but an accumulation of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ vlcfas in the analysis of _LOCATION_ and surface lipids . the mutant phenotypes were rescued by the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus promoter . taken together these data demonstrate that _PROTEIN_ is involved in the elongation of _PROTEIN_ to _PROTEIN_ fatty acids which are essential precursors for the biosynthesis of cuticular waxes aliphatic suberins and _LOCATION_ lipids including sphingolipids and phospholipids . finally possible roles of unidentified kcss are discussed by combining genetic study results and gene _PROTEIN_ data from multiple arabidopsis kcss .
in previous studies the arabidopsis genome was shown to contain kcs genes . to analyze the relationship among kcs genes pairwise multiple alignment was carried out using clustalw web software with the blosum _PROTEIN_ form which is based on amino acid sequences and then a rooted phylogenetic tree with branch length was constructed . based on the arabidopsis microarray analysis the relative _PROTEIN_ patterns of kcs genes were analyzed in various organs or tissues including seeds roots flowers leaves _METHOD_ and epidermis . kcs genes were divided into eight groups . group i was first divided from the other kcss . however the _PROTEIN_ patterns of the kcs genes in group i were very similar to those in groups iv and vi they were _PROTEIN_ in aerial parts but rarely or not _PROTEIN_ in roots . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in group ii and _PROTEIN_ in group iii were very rarely or not _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis organs . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ displayed seed specific and seed predominant _PROTEIN_ respectively . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ genes were ubiquitously _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis suggesting that they may play a role in vlcfa synthesis which is required for growth and development . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in group viii were predominantly _PROTEIN_ in reproductive organs rather than vegetative organs . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ which are involved in cuticular wax biosynthesis showed higher _PROTEIN_ in stem epidermal peels than in _METHOD_ . to confirm the relative _PROTEIN_ level of the _PROTEIN_ gene in different organs or tissues total rnas were isolated from week old roots week old seedlings rosette leaves cauline leaves open flowers pollen grains and siliques from week old plants and _METHOD_ and stem epidermal peels from week old plants and subsequently subjected to quantitative reverse transcription pcr analysis . eukaryotic translation initiation _PROTEIN_ a was used as an internal _PROTEIN_ to verify rna quantity and quality . as shown in figure the level of the _PROTEIN_ transcripts was highest in the stem epidermal peels and was moderately detected in aerial parts of plants including rosette and cauline leaves open flowers pollen grains silique walls and _METHOD_ . also the _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ gene was relatively very low in roots and young seedlings . this result was very similar to those obtained from the microarray analysis . to investigate the spatial and temporal _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ gene a gus reporter gene under the control of the _PROTEIN_ promoter was introduced into arabidopsis . transgenic plants were histochemically stained with bromo chloro indolyl d _PROTEIN_ for gus _PROTEIN_ . after chlorophyll pigments were removed by sequential incubation in to ethanol the stained organs were imaged using a microscope or embedded in acrylic resin and cross sectioned . gus _PROTEIN_ was observed in young seedlings leaves _METHOD_ silique walls anthers sepals upper portion of styles and seed coats but not in developing embryos . as was observed in the qrt pcr analysis gus _PROTEIN_ was also found in leaf and stem epidermal cells . to examine the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ the coding sequence region of the _PROTEIN_ gene was amplified by pcr using the primer set . the amplified dna fragments were inserted into the vector containing the cauliflower mosaic virus promoter and enhanced yellow _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ and the resultant construct was named _METHOD_ . in addition the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ construct which harbored the microsomal oleic acid desaturase gene from brassica rapa under the control of the camv promoter was used as an _LOCATION_ marker . agrobacteria transformed with the _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ construct were coinfiltrated into tobacco epidermal cells . after h of incubation _METHOD_ signals were observed using an _PROTEIN_ laser confocal scanning microscope . the green _METHOD_ signals from _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were found to be exactly merged with the red _METHOD_ signals from _METHOD_ indicating that _PROTEIN_ was localized in the _LOCATION_ . to investigate the function of _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis a transfer dna inserted _PROTEIN_ mutant was isolated by genomic dna pcr using and _PROTEIN_ primer sets as shown in figure a and b . to examine the level of _PROTEIN_ transcripts total rnas were isolated from the wild type and the _PROTEIN_ mutant and subjected to reverse transcription pcr . _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ transcripts was observed in the wild type but not in the _PROTEIN_ mutants . under long day growth conditions for arabidopsis the _PROTEIN_ mutants were found to grow and develop normally . no significant alteration in root growth of _PROTEIN_ mutants compared with the wild type was observed under room and cold temperatures . for complementation of the _PROTEIN_ mutant the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ construct under the control of the camv promoter shown in figure was transformed into the _PROTEIN_ mutant via agrobacterium tumefaciens mediated transformation . kanamycin resistant transgenic _PROTEIN_ lines were further selected by identifying the introduced genes using genomic dna pcr analysis . the level of the _PROTEIN_ transcripts was measured by rt pcr in the leaves of the wild type _PROTEIN_ and complementation lines . the _PROTEIN_ transcripts were observed in complementation lines as well as the wild type . as shown in figure and supplemental figure the _PROTEIN_ gene was ubiquitously _PROTEIN_ . to investigate if _PROTEIN_ is involved in vlcfa synthesis in various arabidopsis organs and tissues total fatty acids were extracted from leaves aerial parts and roots of young seedlings and _METHOD_ flowers and silique walls of the wild type _PROTEIN_ and three complementation lines and analyzed using gas chromatography . in the fatty acid analysis we found that the composition of vlcfas was altered in the _PROTEIN_ mutant relative to the wild type although the vlcfa content was very low in all organs tested except the roots . in leaves and _METHOD_ the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ fatty acid content was higher in _PROTEIN_ than in the wild type and the chemical mutant phenotype was completely restored in the complementation lines . an increase in the amount of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ fatty acids was also observed in the aerial parts of young seedlings and flower organs of the _PROTEIN_ mutant . similarly the _PROTEIN_ fatty acid content was higher in _PROTEIN_ silique walls than in the wild type . in addition the _PROTEIN_ fatty acid content in the roots of _PROTEIN_ was higher but the _PROTEIN_ fatty acid content was significantly lower . however no significant differences were observed in total amounts of fatty acids from the various organs of the wild type _PROTEIN_ and the three complementation lines except for the roots . this difference in vlcfa composition was closely related to the _PROTEIN_ pattern of the _PROTEIN_ gene observed in the various arabidopsis organs . this result indicates that _PROTEIN_ might function in the elongation of _PROTEIN_ vlcfas to _PROTEIN_ vlcfas . in addition the profile of fatty acyl coas was analyzed from roots of _PROTEIN_ and wild type plants to identify the products of _PROTEIN_ . the contents of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ coas were _PROTEIN_ by approximately but the levels of and _PROTEIN_ coas were significantly increased in the _PROTEIN_ mutant relative to the wild type indicating that _PROTEIN_ is involved in the elongation of _PROTEIN_ coa to _PROTEIN_ coa . interestingly the _PROTEIN_ coa levels were _PROTEIN_ but the _PROTEIN_ coa contents were not significantly altered in _PROTEIN_ compared with the wild type . higher _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ gene in stem epidermal peels than in _METHOD_ suggests that _PROTEIN_ may be involved in cuticular wax biosynthesis . to determine if this was the case cuticular waxes were extracted from leaves _METHOD_ and seed coats of the wild type _PROTEIN_ and three complementation lines and analyzed using gc . in the leaves the amounts of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ vlcfas were _PROTEIN_ by and in _PROTEIN_ compared with the wild type respectively . in addition the chemical mutant phenotype was rescued in the leaves of the complementation lines by the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ under the control of the camv promoter . the contents of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ primary alcohols _PROTEIN_ aldehydes and _PROTEIN_ vlcfas were _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ relative to the wild type . these _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ vlcfas were observed in _PROTEIN_ seed coats . however total wax amounts were not significantly altered in _PROTEIN_ relative to the wild type . this result revealed that _PROTEIN_ is involved in cuticular wax biosynthesis . as shown in figure gus _PROTEIN_ in the roots and seed coats prompted us to examine the composition and amounts of suberin polyesters . aliphatic suberin polyesters were extracted from roots and seed coats of the wild type _PROTEIN_ and three complementation lines and hydrolyzed and lipid soluble extracts were analyzed using gc _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . the amounts of _PROTEIN_ fatty acids and _PROTEIN_ hydroxy fatty acids were _PROTEIN_ but the level of _PROTEIN_ fatty acids was increased in _PROTEIN_ roots relative to the wild type . increased levels of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ hydroxy fatty acids and and _PROTEIN_ dicarboxylic acids but _PROTEIN_ levels of _PROTEIN_ vlcfas and dicarboxylic acids were also observed in the _PROTEIN_ seed coat relative to the wild type . in addition the chemical phenotype of the _PROTEIN_ mutant was rescued in complementation lines . no significant changes were observed in total amounts of aliphatic suberins from the roots of the wild type _PROTEIN_ and three complementation lines . this result also indicates that _PROTEIN_ is involved in the elongation of _PROTEIN_ fatty acids from _PROTEIN_ fatty acids which are required for the biosynthesis of the suberin polyesters present in roots and seed coats . because vlcfa moieties are also essential components in sphingolipids and phospholipids such as ps and pe the role of _PROTEIN_ was investigated in sphingolipid and phospholipid metabolism . sphingolipid analysis was performed on week old seedlings of the wild type _PROTEIN_ and three complementation lines . the amounts of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ vlcfas were increased by mol but the levels of _PROTEIN_ vlcfas were _PROTEIN_ by in all sphingolipid species ceramide glycosyl inositolphosphoceramide _PROTEIN_ and hydroxyceramide in _PROTEIN_ compared with the wild type . the _PROTEIN_ vlcfa content was also _PROTEIN_ in ceramide and _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ mutant relative to the wild type . however the total amount of sphingolipids was not altered in the _PROTEIN_ mutant relative to the wild type . the sphingolipid profile of complementation lines was almost identical to that of the wild type . similar results were also observed in the sphingolipid analysis of leaves . in addition glycerolipid analysis was performed on d old roots of wild type and _PROTEIN_ plants . as expected the amounts of _PROTEIN_ fatty acids were increased in ps and pe but no changes were observed in phosphatidylcholine phosphatidylinositol monogalactosyl diacylglycerol and digalactosyl diacylglycerol in _PROTEIN_ compared with the wild type . unexpectedly a _PROTEIN_ in the content of oleic acids and an increase in the content of linoleic acids in phosphatidylglycerol were observed in the _PROTEIN_ mutant relative to the wild type . these results confirmed the role of _PROTEIN_ in sphingolipid and phospholipid biosynthesis .
