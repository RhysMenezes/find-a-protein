in plants basic helix loop helix transcription _PROTEIN_ play important roles in the control of cell elongation . two bhlh proteins _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and arabidopsis binding _PROTEIN_ antagonistically regulate cell elongation in response to brassinosteroid and gibberellin signaling but the detailed molecular _METHOD_ by which these _PROTEIN_ regulate cell elongation remain unclear . here we identify the bhlh transcriptional activators for cell elongation and demonstrate that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and the aces constitute a triantagonistic bhlh system that competitively regulates cell elongation . in this system the ace bhlh transcription _PROTEIN_ directly activate the _PROTEIN_ of enzyme genes for cell elongation by interacting with their promoter regions . _PROTEIN_ negatively regulates cell elongation by interacting with the aces and thus interfering with their dna binding . _PROTEIN_ interacts with _PROTEIN_ and counteracts the ability of _PROTEIN_ to affect aces . therefore _PROTEIN_ restores the transcriptional activity of aces resulting in induction of cell elongation . the balance of triantagonistic bhlh proteins aces _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ might be important for determination of the size of plant cells . the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ is regulated by brassinosteroid gibberellins and developmental phase dependent _PROTEIN_ indicating that two phytohormones and phase dependent signals are integrated by this triantagonistic bhlh system .
to identify transcription _PROTEIN_ that regulate cell elongation in plants we screened our set of transgenic arabidopsis plants _PROTEIN_ chimeric repressor constructs . the cres t construct contains a transcription _PROTEIN_ fused with the plant specific repression domain derived from _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus promoter . fusion of the _PROTEIN_ repression domain to a transcriptional activator can convert it into a strong repressor which dominantly suppresses the _PROTEIN_ of target genes . this overrides the activation by endogenous and functionally redundant transcription _PROTEIN_ and results in a dominant negative phenotype . by contrast the fusion of the _PROTEIN_ to a native repressor enhances the repressive activity and induces a similar phenotype to its ectopic _PROTEIN_ . we found that the cres t line for _GENE_ which was previously reported to be arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ exhibited drastic dwarfism . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plants had round shaped dark green leaves and short petioles siliques and roots which had few _PROTEIN_ roots . these phenotypes were similar to that of br insensitive mutants such as _PROTEIN_ . these dwarf phenotypes appear to be specific to _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plants because there were not observed in the cres t lines for other bhlhs such as _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . also similar to br insensitive mutants in the seedlings of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plants elongation of hypocotyls in continuous dark conditions was _PROTEIN_ . microscopy of hypocotyls and roots revealed that the dwarfism of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plants was due to reduced cell elongation . to determine whether the phenotypes of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plants were due to loss of sensitivity to br or to defective br biosynthesis we treated seedlings with brassinolide . when treated with bl seedlings of wild type plants and those of the br biosynthesis defective mutant _PROTEIN_ were pale green and had elongated hypocotyls and cotyledon petioles although the elongation of hypocotyls of _PROTEIN_ mutant plants was less than that of the wild type . by contrast seedlings of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plants did not exhibit this elongation response when treated with bl indicating that the br insensitive phenotypes of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plants are due to loss of sensitivity to br . microarray analysis revealed that genes for xth and genes for exp which are regulated by br signaling were downregulated in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plants . we confirmed the microarray results for some selected xth and exp genes whose _PROTEIN_ was less than fourfold in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plants when compared with wild type plants in microarray analysis . the results of quantitative rt pcr showed that _PROTEIN_ levels were more than fold lower and _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ levels were more than threefold lower in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plants than in wild type plants . when plants were treated with bl the levels of _PROTEIN_ of those genes were upregulated in the wild type but such upregulation was observed to be slight or nonexistent in the seedlings of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plants . these results confirmed that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plants were insensitive to exogenous and endogenous br and showed that _PROTEIN_ regulates br inducible genes . to further examine the function of _PROTEIN_ in br signaling we next made transgenic arabidopsis that ectopically overexpressed _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . citation reported that plants transformed with _PROTEIN_ exhibited a dark green and dwarf phenotype similar to _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plants . we confirmed that our _PROTEIN_ plants also exhibited the phenotype and insensitivity to br similar to _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plants . in addition qrt pcr analysis revealed that the _PROTEIN_ of br inducible exps and _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ plants was downregulated . these results indicated that the visible phenotype and the changes in gene regulation in _PROTEIN_ plants were similar to those in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plants . usually fusion of a transcriptional activator to _PROTEIN_ phenocopies loss of function mutations of the transcription _PROTEIN_ because the chimeric repressor dominantly suppresses target gene transcription . by contrast fusion of a native repressor to _PROTEIN_ usually phenocopies ectopic _PROTEIN_ of the transcription _PROTEIN_ . the observation that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plants exhibit similar phenotypes indicates that _PROTEIN_ acts as a transcriptional repressor . we next examined the loss of function phenotype of _PROTEIN_ . because a t dna tagged line for _PROTEIN_ was not available we prepared transgenic plants that _PROTEIN_ an _PROTEIN_ rna interference under the control of the native _PROTEIN_ promoter _PROTEIN_ . we examined two independent rnai lines in which the level of _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ to < of the wild type . these _PROTEIN_ plants were larger than the wild type . detailed phenotypic analysis revealed that the hypocotyls and leaves of _PROTEIN_ plants were significantly longer than those of the wild type and that the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ which was downregulated in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plants was upregulated in _PROTEIN_ plants . because the phenotype of _PROTEIN_ was opposite to that of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ our results indicate that _PROTEIN_ acts as a transcriptional repressor that negatively regulates br signaling and organ elongation in arabidopsis . to shed light on the mechanism of _PROTEIN_ function in cell elongation and gene _PROTEIN_ we next examined _PROTEIN_ for indications that it functions as a repressor . the _PROTEIN_ amino acid sequence does not contain any motif that can be categorized as a repression domain such as an ear motif brd or _PROTEIN_ box . transient _PROTEIN_ of the coding region of _PROTEIN_ fused with the yeast dna binding domain _PROTEIN_ did not repress or activate a luc reporter gene in arabidopsis leaves but the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ effector reduced the activity of the reporter gene to < . these results indicate that arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ does not have an active repressive activity but may instead act as a passive repressor . generally passive repressors do not have direct repressive activity but instead may compete with other transcription _PROTEIN_ for binding to a cis element . to analyze whether _PROTEIN_ binds to dna we prepared transgenic plants that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ fused with the activation domain _PROTEIN_ . the activator domain should activate the _PROTEIN_ of a target gene if it interacts with dna through _PROTEIN_ resulting in a phenotype opposite to _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plants . interestingly however _PROTEIN_ plants exhibited a similar phenotype to that of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plants namely round shaped dark green leaves and short hypocotyls . these results indicate that the activation domain did not affect the repressive activity of _PROTEIN_ and that _PROTEIN_ may not bind to dna directly or indirectly . citation reported that the glu and arg amino acids in the basic motif of bhlh proteins are necessary for binding to the e box and g box which are the typical binding sequences of bhlh proteins . our amino acid comparison showed that the bhlh region of _PROTEIN_ was clearly diverged from that of typical bhlh proteins and lacks the amino acid necessary for binding to the e box and g box in the basic motif . these analyses also support that _PROTEIN_ may not have dna binding activity . one of the typical non dna binding _PROTEIN_ proteins human inhibitor of dna binding has been shown to inhibit the activity of other bhlh transcription _PROTEIN_ by heterodimerization . because _PROTEIN_ localizes to the _LOCATION_ as was shown using an _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ fusion protein we hypothesized that _PROTEIN_ may interfere possibly through physical interaction with the dna binding activity of other transcription _PROTEIN_ that activate cell elongation . we predicted that _PROTEIN_ interacts with and thus interferes with the activity of transcription _PROTEIN_ that activate the genes required for cell elongation . to identify those _PROTEIN_ that interact with _PROTEIN_ we next performed yeast two hybrid screens using our cdna library composed of only arabidopsis cdnas for transcription _PROTEIN_ . among positive clones isolated encode typical bhlh transcription _PROTEIN_ including and . in addition we found that _PROTEIN_ interacted with _PROTEIN_ confirming a previous report that _PROTEIN_ interacts with _PROTEIN_ . we also found that _PROTEIN_ interacted with several _PROTEIN_ subfamily proteins namely _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ by individual assay . phylogenetic analysis showed that and are classified into the same subfamily of bhlh transcription _PROTEIN_ . we analyzed the interaction between _PROTEIN_ and each of those bhlhs by individual assays and found that cryptochrome interacting _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ loop _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ also interacted with _PROTEIN_ in yeast as did and . we also analyzed the interaction of _PROTEIN_ with those bhlhs in plant cells using bimolecular _METHOD_ complementation in transient _PROTEIN_ experiments using onion epidermal cells . the bifc analyses revealed that and _PROTEIN_ were capable of forming a heterodimer with _PROTEIN_ in the _LOCATION_ but _PROTEIN_ did not . we named and as activator for cell to . to analyze the biological functions of the aces and _PROTEIN_ genes we prepared transgenic arabidopsis plants that _PROTEIN_ chimeric repressor constructs for each of the aces and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . results showed that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ transgenic plants had dwarf stature round shaped dark green leaves and short siliques which was similar to the phenotypes of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plants by contrast _PROTEIN_ plants had a phenotype similar to the wild type . in contrast with the chimeric repressor phenotypes seedlings of transgenic arabidopsis that ectopically _PROTEIN_ each and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ had slightly but significantly longer hypocotyls than wild type plants . the cotyledons of the seedlings of and _PROTEIN_ plants were slender pale green and longer than the wild type phenotypes opposite to that of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plants and those of plants were similar or slightly shorter than those of the wild type . in rosette plants flowers _PROTEIN_ and sepals of and _PROTEIN_ plants were larger than the wild type but _PROTEIN_ plants had much smaller flowers than the wild type . detailed morphological analysis using scanning electron microscopy revealed that the larger size of _PROTEIN_ of and _PROTEIN_ plants was due to increased cell length but not to increased cell number . these results indicated that and _PROTEIN_ act as transcriptional activators that positively regulate cell elongation although the activity of seemed to be weaker than the others . to analyze whether _PROTEIN_ interferes with the activity of aces we performed transient _PROTEIN_ assays using a reporter construct in which four tandem repeats of cib binding element which was reported to be a binding element for _PROTEIN_ and contains a g box were placed upstream of a luc reporter gene . results of transient _PROTEIN_ assays showed that the activity of the luc reporter gene was upregulated severalfold when the effector in which the activation domain was fused with the c terminus of was coexpressed showing that bound to cibe . by contrast when the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ effector was coexpressed with the luc reporter gene the reporter gene was not activated indicating that _PROTEIN_ did not bind to cibe either directly or indirectly . when the luc reporter was transiently transformed along with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and effectors the activation of the luc reporter gene was suppressed to the basal level . in addition the _PROTEIN_ effector was also able to suppress effector activation of the luc reporter gene . these results indicated that _PROTEIN_ with or without the activation domain inhibited the transcriptional activation activity of the effector and that _PROTEIN_ did not compete with for binding to cibe but might interfere with ability of to bind to cibe . the ability of _PROTEIN_ to interfere with the dna binding activity of was confirmed by electrophoresis mobility shift assay _METHOD_ . _METHOD_ results showed that protein specifically bound to the cibe fragment but did not bind to a mutated cibe fragment . when _PROTEIN_ protein was added to the cibe complex mixture the complex was destroyed in a dose dependent manner . the _METHOD_ data also confirmed that _PROTEIN_ did not bind to the cibe fragment . in addition immunoprecipitation assays clearly showed heterodimer formation between and _PROTEIN_ in nicotiana benthamiana cells confirming the assay and bifc assays in onion epidermal cells . these results indicate that _PROTEIN_ very likely inhibits the dna binding of to the cibe fragment by forming a heterodimer with . _PROTEIN_ was previously reported to act as a positive regulator of plant cell elongation and to interact with _PROTEIN_ . we confirmed the interaction of _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ in our and bifc assays . in addition our immunoprecipitation assays showed an in vivo interaction between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . then we hypothesized that _PROTEIN_ induced cell elongation by interfering with the negative activity of _PROTEIN_ on the aces . to test our hypothesis that _PROTEIN_ suppresses the negative activity of _PROTEIN_ on aces we performed transient _PROTEIN_ assays . the upregulation of the luc reporter gene by effector was suppressed when _PROTEIN_ was coexpressed . however the upregulation of luc activity was restored when _PROTEIN_ was coexpressed with _PROTEIN_ and . therefore _PROTEIN_ was able to counteract the negative effect of _PROTEIN_ . these results indicate that _PROTEIN_ interfered with the negative activity of _PROTEIN_ on . in addition _METHOD_ assays showed that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ complex did not bind to the cibe fragment and that _PROTEIN_ protein did not supershift the cibe complex . these results indicate that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ do not have dna binding activity to cibe fragment and _PROTEIN_ did not interact with the cibe complex . moreover we did not detect interaction between _PROTEIN_ and in either bifc or immunoprecipitation assays where interaction of and _PROTEIN_ was clearly observed . these results indicate that _PROTEIN_ promotes the activation activity of by inhibiting the negative activity of _PROTEIN_ on . _PROTEIN_ likely accomplishes this by interaction with _PROTEIN_ but not by interaction with . the final result of this double inhibition is increased _PROTEIN_ of genes regulated by and the promotion of cell elongation . qrt pcr analyses revealed that the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plants and _PROTEIN_ plants but it was increased in _PROTEIN_ plants . to confirm whether _PROTEIN_ aces and _PROTEIN_ directly regulate the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ we examined the direct binding of to the promoter region of _PROTEIN_ by _METHOD_ . competition _METHOD_ showed that the short fragments of _PROTEIN_ promoter that contain the g box like motif diminished the binding of to cibe fragment but the fragment that did not contain a g box like element did not compete . therefore these data showed specific binding of to the g box like elements located in the _PROTEIN_ promoter region . next we performed transient _PROTEIN_ assays using a reporter gene in which kb of the _PROTEIN_ upstream region was placed upstream of the luc reporter gene . transient _PROTEIN_ assays showed that the activity of luc increased when the effector was coexpressed indicating that directly activated the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ . similar to the luc reporter gene the activation activity of on the luc reporter gene was suppressed when _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ effector was coexpressed . moreover the suppressive activity of _PROTEIN_ effector was inhibited and the luc reporter gene activity was restored when the _PROTEIN_ effector was coexpressed . these results indicate that the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ is likely to be regulated by a triple bhlh system which is composed of one typical bhlh activator and two non dna binding _PROTEIN_ inhibitors _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . it was previously reported that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is suppressed by _PROTEIN_ in br signaling . we confirmed that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was suppressed by bl treatment and slightly increased in _PROTEIN_ mutant plants as shown previously . by contrast bl treatment did not affect the _PROTEIN_ of either _PROTEIN_ or indicating that the br signaling cascade may not regulate the _PROTEIN_ of aces . citation reported that _PROTEIN_ and its homolog _PROTEIN_ bound to the _PROTEIN_ promoter and repressed its _PROTEIN_ . transient _PROTEIN_ assays using a reporter gene in which the _PROTEIN_ upstream region was placed upstream of the luc gene showed that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ effectors _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ suppressed the activity of the luc reporter gene although the repressive activity of the _PROTEIN_ effector was weaker than the _PROTEIN_ effector . these results suggest that br induces cell elongation via _PROTEIN_ repression of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . to analyze the relationship between the _PROTEIN_ patterns of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and aces and the plant cell elongation during development we performed qrt pcr analysis using rna isolated from _METHOD_ siliques and leaves in cell elongating and growth arrested phases . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ levels were higher in the organs in growth arrested phases namely the bottom parts of _METHOD_ and fully expanded old leaves and long siliques where cell elongation was arrested than in the organs in growth phase namely the top part of _METHOD_ young and small leaves and short siliques . by contrast the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ was essentially opposite to that of _PROTEIN_ . for example the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ was higher in the organs in elongating phase tissues than in growth arrested phase tissues . these _PROTEIN_ patterns of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in stem leaves and siliques were correlated with cell elongation and might be regulated by developmental _PROTEIN_ . by contrast the _PROTEIN_ pattern of aces and _PROTEIN_ do not appear to be correlated to growth phase nor to _PROTEIN_ .
