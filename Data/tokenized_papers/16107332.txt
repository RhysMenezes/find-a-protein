aminoacyl trna synthetases are key enzymes involved in protein translation and both _LOCATION_ and organellar _METHOD_ are present in the genomes of eukaryotes . in this study we investigated cellular effects of depletion of organellar _METHOD_ of ars using virus induced gene silencing in nicotiana benthamiana . vigs of nbers and nbsrs which encode organellar glurs and serrs respectively resulted in a severe leaf yellowing phenotype . the nbers and nbsrs genes were ubiquitously _PROTEIN_ in plant tissues and induced in response to light . green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ fusion proteins of the full length glutamyl trna synthetase _LOCATION_ and seryl trna synthetase _PROTEIN_ of arabidopsis and _METHOD_ fusions to the n terminal extension of these proteins were all dualtargeted to chloroplasts and mitochondria . at the cell level depletion of nbers and nbsrs resulted in dramatically reduced numbers of chloroplasts with reduced sizes and chlorophyll content . the numbers and/or physiology of mitochondria were also severely affected . the abnormal chloroplasts lacked most of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and appeared to be degenerating whereas some of them showed doublet morphology indicating defective chloroplast division . pulse field gel electrophoresis analyses demonstrated that chloroplast dna in subgenomic sizes is the predominant form in the abnormal chloroplasts . interestingly despite severe abnormalities in chloroplasts and mitochondria _PROTEIN_ of many _LOCATION_ genes encoding chloroplastor mitochondria targeted proteins and chlorophyll biosynthesis genes remained unchanged in the _LOCATION_ and _PROTEIN_ vigs lines . this is the first report to analyze the effect of ars disruption on organelle development in plants .
virus induced gene silencing of the nbers and nbsrs caused severe leaf yellowing genomics has been carried out in n. benthamiana using trv based virus induced gene silencing to assess functions of signaling genes and genes that likely cause embryo or seedling lethality when their _PROTEIN_ is suppressed . vigs is based on the phenomenon that gene _PROTEIN_ is suppressed in a sequence specific manner by infection with viral vectors carrying host genes and has been proved to be a powerful tool to analyze embryoor seedling lethal genes . using a vigs screen we found that gene silencing of the n. benthamiana nbers and nbsrs genes encoding _METHOD_ of glurs and serrs respectively causes severe leaf yellowing and abnormal leaf morphology while _PROTEIN_ almost normal plant growth . the full length nbers cdna was obtained by rapid amplification of cdna ends . the full length nbsrs cdna was obtained by pcr based on the sequence in the tigr data base . nbers and nbsrs encode polypeptides of and amino acids respectively corresponding to theoretical molecular _METHOD_ of and da . the nbers and nbsrs genes exhibited high sequence similarity to the corresponding genes of prokaryotes particularly cyanobacterial species indicating that they encode an organellar isoform of glurs and serrs . the arabidopsis data base contains one sequence encoding an organellar glurs designated _PROTEIN_ and a sequence for an organellar serrs designated _PROTEIN_ . when the amino acid sequences of the organellar _LOCATION_ and _PROTEIN_ genes from plants were aligned with the corresponding genes from prokaryotes a notable difference between the plant proteins and the corresponding bacterial proteins is that plant proteins contain a long extension at their n terminus which has features of chloroplast and mitochondria targeting signals . suppression of the nbers and nbsrs transcripts by induce gene silencing of nbers and nbsrs we cloned different fragments of the nbers and nbsrs cdnas into the trv based vigs vector and infiltrated n. benthamiana plants with agrobacterium containing each plasmid . trv _LOCATION_ and trv _LOCATION_ contain the n terminal bp and the c terminal bp of the nbers cdna respectively whereas trv _LOCATION_ contains a kb cdna fragment . similarly trv _PROTEIN_ and trv _PROTEIN_ contains the n terminal bp and the c terminal bp of the nbsrs cdna respectively whereas trv _PROTEIN_ contains a kb cdna fragment . vigs with these constructs all resulted in a similar yellowing phenotype in newly emerged leaves whereas overall plant growth was normal . during flower formation the sepals became yellow in the _LOCATION_ plants . however except that flower development was normal in both _LOCATION_ and _PROTEIN_ vigs lines . in contrast vigs of nbirs which encodes an organellar form of ilers resulted in only a mild leaf yellowing phenotype when a kb cdna fragment was used for vigs . as a control we also carried out vigs of c irs which encodes a _LOCATION_ form of ilers and it resulted in arrested plant growth and severe developmental abnormalities in newly emerged leaves distinct from the vigs phenotypes of the organellar arss . effects of gene silencing on the amounts of endogenous nbers and nbsrs mrnas were examined by semiquantitative rt pcr . rt pcr using the _LOCATION_ a primers produced significantly reduced amounts of pcr products in the yellow sectors of the leaves from the trv _LOCATION_ line indicating that the endogenous level of the nbers transcripts is greatly reduced in these plants . the same primers detected high levels of viral genomic transcripts containing the n terminal region of nbers in the trv _LOCATION_ and trv _LOCATION_ lines . similarly rt pcr using the _LOCATION_ b primers produced significantly reduced amounts of pcr products in the yellow sectors of leaves from the trv _LOCATION_ line whereas the same primers detected high levels of viral genomic transcripts containing the c terminal region of nbers in the trv _LOCATION_ and trv _LOCATION_ lines . in all of the _LOCATION_ vigs lines the transcript level of nbsrs nbirs and actin remained constant . silencing of nbsrs was also examined by semiquantitative rt pcr . rt pcr using the _PROTEIN_ a and _PROTEIN_ b primers produced significantly reduced amounts of pcr products in yellow sectors of leaves from the trv _PROTEIN_ and trv _PROTEIN_ lines respectively indicating that the endogenous level of the nbsrs transcripts is significantly reduced in those plants . in all of the _PROTEIN_ vigs lines the transcript levels of nbers nbirs and actin stayed constant . these results clearly show that vigs using the nbers and nbsrs cdna fragments specifically suppresses _PROTEIN_ of these genes . the transcripts levels of nbers and nbsrs in trv were identical to those in wild type indicating that trv infection did not affect the _PROTEIN_ of nbers and nbsrs . although vigs of nbirs caused only mild phenotypes compared with silencing of nbers and nbsrs the degree of gene silencing of nbirs in its vigs lines was similar to that of nbers and nbsrs at least at the mrna level . these data suggest that each organellar ars may have a distinct threshold level required for normal organelle function . _PROTEIN_ patterns of nbers and examine tissue specific _PROTEIN_ patterns of nbers and nbsrs semiquantitative rtpcr analyses were carried out using the nbers and nbsrs specific primer sets . rt pcr products of nbers and nbsrs were detected in all of the tissues examined including roots _METHOD_ mature leaves young leaves flower buds and open flowers in n. benthamiana with somewhat higher levels of the transcripts in young tissues such as young leaves and flower buds . the light dependent gene _PROTEIN_ of nbers and nbsrs was examined by semiquantitative rt pcr . n. benthamiana seedlings were grown for days on _METHOD_ media under normal light conditions under dark conditions or under dark conditions followed by a transfer to light for h. the nbers and nbsrs mrna levels were lower in dark grown seedlings than light grown seedlings but exposure to light for h after the dark grown period increased the nbers and nbsrs mrna levels to that of light grown seedlings . as a positive control nbgyrb _PROTEIN_ in response to light was also monitored . nbgyrb encodes subunit b of dna _PROTEIN_ which plays a critical role in chloroplast dna metabolism and is induced by light . these results indicate that _PROTEIN_ of nbers and nbsrs is stimulated by light . dual targeting of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ to chloroplasts and examined the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ contain a long extension at their n terminus which contains features of dual targeting signals to chloroplasts and mitochondria . we generated fusion proteins in which the n terminal regions or the full length proteins of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were fused to _METHOD_ . for _PROTEIN_ the n terminal sequence of aa and the full length sequence of aa were used . for _PROTEIN_ the n terminal sequence of aa and the full length sequence of aa were used . these dna constructs encoding different _METHOD_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion proteins under the control of the promoter were introduced into protoplasts isolated from arabidopsis seedlings . to track mitochondria a dna construct encoding an _METHOD_ fusion protein of the mitochondrial subunit and red _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ was cotransformed into the protoplasts . after incubation at for h _PROTEIN_ of the introduced genes was examined by confocal laser scanning microscopy with different filters to capture images of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ of chlorophyll . for both _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transformed protoplasts the green _METHOD_ signal completely overlapped with both _METHOD_ of chloroplasts and the red _METHOD_ signal of _METHOD_ indicating that the _PROTEIN_ protein was targeted to both chloroplasts and mitochondria . similarly both _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transformed protoplasts exhibited overlapping _METHOD_ signals from _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and chlorophyll _METHOD_ indicating dual targeting of _PROTEIN_ . these results demonstrate that the n terminal extension of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ contains a signal for transport of the protein to both chloroplasts and mitochondria . numbers of chloroplasts and were generated from yellow sectors of the leaves from the trv _LOCATION_ and trv _PROTEIN_ lines and examined by confocal laser scanning microscopy . as controls protoplasts from the trv were also observed . in both trv _LOCATION_ and trv _PROTEIN_ almost all of the protoplasts mostly originated from leaf mesophyll cells exhibited drastically reduced numbers of chloroplasts . the average number of chloroplasts in the trv _LOCATION_ and trv _PROTEIN_ lines was about and of the trv control respectively . chlorophyll content of the leaves was consistently much lower in the vigs lines than the trv controls . furthermore chloroplasts from the trv _LOCATION_ and trv _PROTEIN_ lines were significantly smaller than trv controls and measured and of the average control diameter respectively . some of the chloroplasts in the trv _LOCATION_ and trv _PROTEIN_ lines were dumbbell shaped indicating disrupted chloroplast division . the chloroplast numbers and diameter chlorophyll _METHOD_ and total chlorophyll contents in trv were very similar to those in wild type . mitochondria in leaf protoplasts isolated from the trv control trv _LOCATION_ and trv _PROTEIN_ lines were examined by tmrm and mitotracker green fm _METHOD_ probes . tmrm is a lipophilic cation that accumulates in mitochondria in proportion to the mitochondrial _LOCATION_ potential and a drop in the _LOCATION_ potential leads to a _PROTEIN_ in _METHOD_ . the average tmrm _METHOD_ of protoplasts from trv _LOCATION_ and trv _PROTEIN_ leaves was and of trv controls respectively . this _PROTEIN_ in _METHOD_ could be due to either reduced mitochondrial numbers or altered _LOCATION_ potential of mitochondria in the protoplasts . mitotracker green fm accumulates in mitochondria _PROTEIN_ of the mitochondrial _LOCATION_ potential and is widely used to determine mitochondrial _METHOD_ . the mg _METHOD_ of the protoplasts from trv _LOCATION_ and trv _PROTEIN_ leaves and respectively was significantly lower than that of the trv control . this indicates that mitochondrial numbers and/or _METHOD_ are reduced in the _LOCATION_ and _PROTEIN_ vigs lines . the tmrm and mg _METHOD_ of mitochondria in trv were very similar to those in wild type . ultrastructural analysis of electron microscopy of transverse leaf sections of the trv _LOCATION_ and trv _PROTEIN_ vigs lines showed a large difference in the chloroplast number and morphology compared with trv controls whereas the leaf cell structure was relatively normal . in trv controls mesophyll cell chloroplasts have a well developed _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ system and large starch granules . yellow sectors of the leaves from the trv _LOCATION_ and trv _PROTEIN_ lines exhibited severely reduced chloroplast numbers and morphological abnormalities were apparent in the chloroplasts . the abnormal chloroplasts were small and irregular in shape and contained few starch grains . the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ were either poorly developed or in the process of disintegration and exhibited radical alterations in arrangement and distribution . interestingly some of the chloroplasts in the trv _LOCATION_ and trv _PROTEIN_ lines exhibited a dumbbell shaped morphology with a central constriction mimicking chloroplasts undergoing division but with the two daughter chloroplasts differing in size . those organelles may represent chloroplasts arrested during division due to abnormal conditions within the organelle . consistent with the lack of starch accumulation in the abnormal chloroplasts starch contents in the yellowing leaves from the trv _LOCATION_ and trv _PROTEIN_ lines were much lower than that of trv leaves during the light period based on iodine staining . as expected the yellow sectors of the leaves from the trv _LOCATION_ and trv _PROTEIN_ lines perfectly overlapped with the regions that were not stained with iodine . in contrast to the leaf yellowing phenotype of the organellar arss vigs of the _LOCATION_ form of ilers resulted in arrested plant growth and abnormal leaf development . transverse leaf sections revealed that the trv control leaves had the typical leaf structure of dicotyledonous plants . in the trv c irs leaves the cell numbers _PROTEIN_ and the cell sizes increased in every layer which was accompanied by an irregular cell morphology whereas the typical dorsoventral organization of the palisade and mesophyll cells was mostly _PROTEIN_ . transmission electron microscopy showed that chloroplasts of the mesophyll cells in the trv c irs lines contained large starch granules a dramatic contrast to the lack of starch accumulation in the trv _LOCATION_ and trv _PROTEIN_ chloroplasts . thus depletion of the organellar or the _LOCATION_ form of ars resulted in completely different cellular and organellar phenotypes in plants . chloroplast dna protoplasts from trv trv _LOCATION_ and trv _PROTEIN_ lines were stained with dapi and squashed on a microslide to visualize individual chloroplasts and chloroplast nucleoids . the trv control exhibited faint staining of chloroplast nucleoids . chloroplast nucleoids are dispersed as small particles in the stroma mostly associated with _LOCATION_ and the nucleoid numbers and chloroplast dna content vary during chloroplast development . recent studies have revealed that the amount of cp dna per chloroplast _PROTEIN_ as the chloroplasts develop and reaches undetectable levels in mature leaves long before the onset of senescence in arabidopsis and maize . compared with the trv control chloroplasts of trv _LOCATION_ and trv _PROTEIN_ lines had increased dapi _METHOD_ suggesting increased chloroplast dna content whereas the chloroplast size was much reduced . we used pfge to estimate the size of cp dna molecules in leaf chloroplasts isolated from trv trv _LOCATION_ and trv _PROTEIN_ vigs lines . equal numbers of leaf protoplasts prepared from each vigs line were embedded and subjected to pfge . previously lilly et al . demonstrated that both linear and circular dna fibers with one to four copies of the chloroplast genome are present in tobacco chloroplasts with monomers being the predominant structure . in the trv control hybridization of the _PROTEIN_ gene probe to dna blots from pfge consistently revealed a band corresponding to the monomeric cp dna . faint hybridization signals below the monomeric band are likely to represent cp dna molecules of subgenomic size or sheared cp dna . in the trv _LOCATION_ line a distinct monomeric cp dna band was not detected and the subgenomic hybridization signal was prominent . in the trv _PROTEIN_ line the monomeric band was visible but the hybridization signal from the subgenomic cp dna was more prominent than control cp dna . the small cp dna molecules abundant in these lines could be a cleavage product of replication intermediates . in contrast cp dna molecules containing multiple chloroplast genomes were not observed in these vigs lines . thus compromised translation activity in the chloroplasts appeared to induce accumulation of cp dna representing partial genome units . _PROTEIN_ of the _LOCATION_ genes for the chloroplast or mitochondria targeted proteins and the chlorophyll biosynthetic development involves coordinated _PROTEIN_ of both _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ genes and subsequent translocation of _LOCATION_ encoded proteins into developing chloroplasts . it has been proposed that signals from chloroplasts known as _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ regulate _LOCATION_ gene _PROTEIN_ . the effects of depletion of the organellar arss on transcription of various _LOCATION_ genes were examined by semiquantitative rt pcr using rna from wild type and trv leaves and yellow sectors of the trv _LOCATION_ and trv _PROTEIN_ leaves . the mrna levels of _LOCATION_ genes encoding chloroplast targeted proteins such as rbcs lhcb and ftsz in the trv _LOCATION_ and trv _PROTEIN_ lines were very similar to those in the trv control . furthermore transcript levels of _LOCATION_ genes that encode enzymes in the chlorophyll biosynthesis pathway such as _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in the trv _LOCATION_ and trv _PROTEIN_ lines were also similar to those of trv . as controls _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ signaling genes in plant defense and the actin gene remained constant . thus many _LOCATION_ genes for chloroplast function were _PROTEIN_ at normal levels _PROTEIN_ of the grossly abnormal status of chloroplasts in the cell indicating disrupted communication between the chloroplasts and the _LOCATION_ . this result indicates that the chloroplast translation system may be involved in biosynthesis of the _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ . we also observed that _PROTEIN_ of _LOCATION_ genes encoding the mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase and malate dehydrogenase _PROTEIN_ remained unaffected by impaired mitochondrial function in the leaf cells of the _LOCATION_ and _PROTEIN_ vigs plants . the mechanism of communication between mitochondria and the _LOCATION_ has been well documented in yeast and animal _METHOD_ . however the regulation of _LOCATION_ encoded mitochondrial proteins in plants is largely unknown . the results in this study suggest that a defective mitochondrial translation system may inhibit the signaling of mitochondrial dysfunction to the _LOCATION_ .
