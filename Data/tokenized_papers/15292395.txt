in the fission yeast schizosaccharomyces pombe the onset of septum formation is signalled via the septation initiation network involving several protein kinases and a _PROTEIN_ . arabidopsis thaliana and brassica napus proteins homologous to fission yeast _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ exhibit a significant similarity . the plant proteins _PROTEIN_ and are able to complement the s. pombe mutant proteins and _PROTEIN_ respectively and to induce mutisepta when overexpressed in wild type yeast . yeast two hybrid assays demonstrated interactions both between plant proteins and between plant and yeast proteins of the sin pathway . however the primary structure of the proteins as well as the partial complementation of yeast mutants indicates that plant homologous proteins and their yeast counterparts have diverged during evolution . real time rt pcr studies demonstrated plant sin related gene _PROTEIN_ in all organs tested and a co _PROTEIN_ pattern during the cell cycle with a higher accumulation at _PROTEIN_ m. during interphase the plant sin related proteins were found to co localise predominantly in the nucleolus of the plant cells as shown by fusions to green _METHOD_ protein . these data suggest the existence of a plant sin related pathway .
to identify plant genes that encode putative sin components fission yeast and _PROTEIN_ sequences were used to screen the genbank database using the basic local alignment search tool . the arabidopsis genome contains two homologues of each of the fission yeast genes namely _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and which were amplified by pcr from an a. thaliana root cdna library . the genes _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are highly similar to the gene encoding the yeast _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ encode polypeptides of and amino acids respectively sharing overall sequence identity . from s. pombe showed sequence identities of and with _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ respectively . however the plant and fungal proteins differ in their organisation in that the two plant proteins possess an amino terminal extension consisting of residues in _PROTEIN_ and residues in _PROTEIN_ sharing identity . the neighbour joining dendogram shown in fig . indicates that and _PROTEIN_ from s. cerevisiae from giardia intestinalis and _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ constitute a new monomeric g protein subfamily . none of these proteins possess the _PROTEIN_ terminal caax prenylation motif required for the association with cell _LOCATION_ by lipid anchoring . analysis of the and genes and their deduced protein sequences revealed that they are closely related to the _PROTEIN_ gene . and encode protein kinases of and residues respectively belonging to the sok group of as illustrated in fig . . they show an overall identity of and are highly similar to brassica napus and previously reported by leprince et al . . in vitro kinase assays demonstrated that the cdna encodes a functional serine/threonine protein kinase with auto phosphorylation activity which is also able to phosphorylate myelin basic protein . fig . shows that _PROTEIN_ and the two proteins from arabidopsis share identity over the catalytic domain whereas they share similarity over the short _PROTEIN_ terminal domain . moreover the organisation of the plant proteins differs from that of _PROTEIN_ by a non catalytic _PROTEIN_ terminal extension consisting of and amino acids in and respectively . no significant similarities were observed between _PROTEIN_ or and proteins from the fully sequenced genomes of caenorhabditis elegans drosophila melanogaster and homo sapiens . hence the genes and their corresponding proteins described in this study are designated as plant specific sin related components . in fission yeast the sin pathway couples the end of anaphase with the initiation of cytokinesis . the bioinformatical studies described here show that the plant sin related proteins are highly similar . therefore it was tempting to speculate that these plant proteins can complement the or _PROTEIN_ yeast mutants by reconstituting a functional sin pathway . to test this hypothesis yeast complementation experiments overexpression and two hybrid assays were performed . the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or coding regions were linked to the thiamine repressible _PROTEIN_ promoter in the vector and introduced into the and _PROTEIN_ mutant s. pombe strains . a comparison of the mutant phenotypes under permissive _PROTEIN_ and restrictive conditions showed that cells at failed to form septa _PROTEIN_ . these cells go through additional _LOCATION_ division cycles without septation leading to the production of elongated and multinucleated cells . by contrast hours after the shift to the yeast cells _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or produced normal septa . in addition about of the yeast cells _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ produced additional septum material at the cell tips . a very similar phenotype was previously observed after complementation of the yeast mutant by the plant protein kinase which suggests that the two proteins transduce the same signal in s. pombe . no noticeable abnormalities were observed in cells containing either the constructs _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or under non inducing conditions or the empty vector under inducing conditions _PROTEIN_ . in fission yeast overexpression of and using the thiamine repressible _PROTEIN_ vector induces multiple rounds of septum formation without cell cleavage . in contrast overexpression of _PROTEIN_ does not compromise the signalling of cytokinesis . in order to investigate further the role of the plant homologues of and _PROTEIN_ genes we overexpressed the a. thaliana and b. napus proteins in the wild type s. pombe background . upon withdrawal of thiamine growth of the yeast cells carrying the empty plasmid was not affected . in contrast overexpression of either _PROTEIN_ or disturbed the formation of the septum in part of the cells resulting in multiseptate cells . furthermore of the septate cells overexpressing _PROTEIN_ showed abnormal cytokinesis forming cells that were either multiseptate or uninucleate with one or more septa . no abnormal phenotype was observed among the cells overexpressing . cell populations overexpressing either _PROTEIN_ or formed twice as many septa as wild type cell populations . conversely cells carrying the gene did not differ from the wild type with _PROTEIN_ to the percentage of septum forming cells . these results show that overexpression of either the plant or _PROTEIN_ does not affect the cytokinesis process and that overexpression of the plant homologues of or is able to control at least partially cytokinesis in fission yeast . and interact both genetically and physically . binds to and . in order to investigate a possible interaction between the plant sin related homologues and s. pombe sin proteins we performed yeast two hybrid experiments . the assays based both on growth on medium lacking his and on galactosidase activities indicate an interaction between _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ and . furthermore we also detected positive interactions of with either _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ . conversely no interaction could be detected between and . to test the ability of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ to interact two hybrid experiments were conducted . these experiments showed that but not or could interact with _PROTEIN_ in yeast . no interaction was detected between _PROTEIN_ and suggesting a functional difference between the two atsgp proteins . thus the complementation of the yeast sin mutants by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or and the effects of the overexpression of these proteins and on the division of yeast as well as their interactions in the yeast two hybrid system with one another and with the yeast sin proteins provide complementary evidence that the plant sin related proteins are in fission yeast cells functional homologues of and _PROTEIN_ . we measured the relative transcript level of _PROTEIN_ and genes in various arabidopsis organs using real time rt pcr . the actin genes _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ amplified simultaneously were used as a standard because of their housekeeping functions and demonstrated stable _PROTEIN_ profiles . the _PROTEIN_ and genes were ubiquitously _PROTEIN_ with slightly higher transcript levels in flower buds and mature flowers . in contrast the _PROTEIN_ gene displayed a significant differential _PROTEIN_ with transcript levels times higher in flower buds and times higher in mature flowers than in other organs . jouannic et al . previously showed that the transcript levels are regulated during the cell cycle showing a peak of _PROTEIN_ at the _PROTEIN_ m phase transition . in order to get an overview of the _PROTEIN_ of each a. thaliana sin homologue during the cell cycle we performed _PROTEIN_ analyses of the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ genes in aphidicoline synchronised cell suspension cultures of arabidopsis using real time rt pcr . as reference genes we monitored the _PROTEIN_ of the cell cycle phase specific markers histone _PROTEIN_ and cyclin _PROTEIN_ marking the s phase and the _PROTEIN_ m transition respectively . examination of the transcript levels of these eight genes during the cell cycle revealed two types of _PROTEIN_ patterns . the first _PROTEIN_ profile is similar to the profile of _PROTEIN_ and comprises transcripts profiles of _PROTEIN_ and genes which are all co _PROTEIN_ at a higher level at the _PROTEIN_ m transition . the second type consists of the transcript _PROTEIN_ patterns of and _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ transcripts were markedly induced during s phase and the steady state level remained stable during _PROTEIN_ . in contrast to the other genes displayed a quasi constitutive _PROTEIN_ profile during the course of the cell cycle . hence _PROTEIN_ of several of the plant sin related genes is tightly regulated during the cell cycle with respect to their transcription and/or transcript stability with the highest mrna accumulation at the _PROTEIN_ m phases . in s. pombe a major part of the regulation of the sin pathway proteins resides in a strict control of their subcellular localisation during the cell cycle . to investigate whether a similar regulation occurs in plant cells the localisation of the plant sin related proteins was determined using transiently _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusions . because of their amenability to microscopic analysis protoplasts of tobacco cells were used for these studies . twenty four hours after protoplast transformation all _METHOD_ fusions with the different plant sin related homologues were localised to the _LOCATION_ of interphase cells . the data shown in fig . illustrate that each of the _METHOD_ tagged proteins appeared concentrated in the non dapi staining region of the _LOCATION_ i.e . the nucleolus . these interphase cells were characterised by a large nucleolus . a faint diffuse signal was also detectable in the nucleoplasm all around the _LOCATION_ and in the cytoplasm . in control cells transformed with _METHOD_ alone _METHOD_ was localised both to the _LOCATION_ and to the cytoplasm including cytoplasmic strands . _METHOD_ alone is smaller than the accepted exclusion size limit of _LOCATION_ pores in agreement with its distribution both in the cytoplasm and the _LOCATION_ . however the size of the plant sin like component _METHOD_ fusion proteins are above the exclusion size limit of _LOCATION_ pores indicating that the plant _METHOD_ tagged proteins are translocated to the _LOCATION_ by an active process . we were unable to identify potential _LOCATION_ localisation signals similar to the ones identified by kalderon et al . and robbins et al . from database searches . in conclusion these results show that in plant cells all of the plant sin related components _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and localise to the nucleolus .
