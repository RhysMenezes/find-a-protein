the functional protein phosphatase type from beechnut was a negative regulator of abscisic acid signaling in seeds . in this report to get deeper insight on function we aim to identify _PROTEIN_ interacting partners . two closely related members _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ of the arabidopsis betv i family were shown to bind in a yeast two hybrid screening and in an aba independent manner . by transient _PROTEIN_ of and _PROTEIN_ in epidermal onion cells and agroinfiltration in tobacco as green _METHOD_ protein fusion proteins we obtained evidence supporting the subcellular localization of both proteins _PROTEIN_ in the _LOCATION_ and in both the _LOCATION_ and the _LOCATION_ respectively . the in planta interaction of both proteins in tobacco cells by bimolecular _METHOD_ complementation assays resulted in a specific _LOCATION_ colocalization of this interaction . constitutive overexpression of _PROTEIN_ confers aba hypersensitivity in arabidopsis seeds and consequently an enhanced degree of seed dormancy . additionally transgenic _PROTEIN_ plants are unable to germinate under low concentrations of mannitol nacl or paclobutrazol which are not inhibiting conditions to the wild type . in vegetative tissues arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ transgenic plants show aba resistant drought response and a strong inhibition of early root growth . these phenotypes are strengthened at the molecular level with the enhanced induction of several aba response genes . both seed and vegetative phenotypes of arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ plants are opposite those of plants . finally double transgenic plants confirm the role of _PROTEIN_ by antagonizing function and demonstrating that _PROTEIN_ positively regulates aba signaling during germination and abiotic stress responses .
we have previously reported the isolation and functional characterization of as a plant type protein phosphatase with all the conserved features of the catalytic domain of these proteins which acts as a negative regulator of aba responses in seeds . our results suggest that this _PROTEIN_ from beech which is a foreign protein in arabidopsis tissues possesses at least its corresponding signaling components in this plant model species . in a search of interacting proteins _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis a yeast two hybrid screening was performed using as bait . as a result we have identified three different proteins _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ showing interaction with . two of the _PROTEIN_ ips are closely related members of an arabidopsis gene family namely _GENE_ _PROTEIN_ and _GENE_ _PROTEIN_ . in particular five clones belonging to the same _PROTEIN_ were identified explaining a strong interaction . blast searches in arabidopsis using the amino acid sequence encoded by both genes as query revealed high similarity with the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ gene family recently identified and composed of members . all members encode small proteins ranging between and amino acid residues characterized by the presence of the well conserved betv i family signature in many members of the family as revealed by protein domain analysis using the interpro database . this signature is present in different plant allergens and specifically the betv i family corresponds to particularly potent allergens from white birch pollen . interacting proteins obtained by yeast two hybrid assay in arabidopsis the phylogenetic relationship between _PROTEIN_ and other closely related plant protein _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is shown in figure . a phylogenetic tree was constructed using the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and homologs from the genome sequence databases of five lower and higher plants . the phylogenetic tree reveals the presence of ancient gene duplication events that predate the speciation of dicots monocots and mosses leading to the six distinct clades indicated in figure . the data available after recent sequencing projects have revealed the conservation of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in lower land plants such as the moss p. patens and in the lycophyte s. moellendorfii . different _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ subgroups can be identified and proteins from all plant species analyzed are present in at least one subgroup suggesting the probable existence of _PROTEIN_ ip homologs in all considered genomes as well as in the common ancestor of all the species examined . one of the clades contains exclusively sequences from the lower plants p. patens and s. moellendorfii suggesting that this lineage of plants contains a copy of betv i containing proteins with specialized functions . additionally three clades can be clearly distinguished which include most of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ from higher plants where duplications are present and two other clades including arabidopsis and one or two more higher species . the high identity found in the betv i domain and the evolutionary conservation among these _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ support a regulatory function for this domain . moreover the interaction of two members of this family with the aba related plant type protein phosphatase suggests that they might have a role in the aba signal transduction pathway but it has not been investigated yet . to ascertain the potential site of action of and its interacting partner within the cell the subcellular localization of these proteins was investigated using n terminal _METHOD_ fusions of full length and _PROTEIN_ . as depicted in figure transient _PROTEIN_ of these constructs in epidermal onion cells showed that the _PROTEIN_ cellular _PROTEIN_ pattern was similar to that of the native _METHOD_ demonstrating that the full length protein appeared in both the cytoplasm and the _LOCATION_ . furthermore was mostly localized in the _LOCATION_ . the exact localization of this protein was corroborated with confocal microscopy slides of cell sections through the _LOCATION_ and showing the _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ . interestingly c terminal _METHOD_ fusions of altered the subcellular localization of the native protein in tobacco and arabidopsis cells indicating the presence of signals in this end that might be relevant for its localization pattern . in a similar way agroinfiltration analysis of the same constructs delivered in tobacco leaves confirmed the same subcellular localization for highlighting the _LOCATION_ pattern and the localization for the interacting partner _PROTEIN_ appearing in the whole cell . bimolecular _METHOD_ complementation assays were used to detect the interaction between and the _PROTEIN_ proteins _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in plant cells . with this purpose was translationally fused to the c terminal amino acid region of the yellow _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ in the _METHOD_ vector which generated a _METHOD_ fusion protein . moreover _GENE_ and _GENE_ were translationally fused to the n terminal amino acid region of the yellow _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ in the _METHOD_ vector which generated the _METHOD_ _GENE_ and _METHOD_ _GENE_ fusion proteins respectively . the corresponding constructs were codelivered into tobacco leaf cells by agrobacterium tumefaciens infiltration and as a result _METHOD_ was observed in the _LOCATION_ of tobacco cells in agreement with the previous finding in the two hybrid assay and subcellular localization . similar results were obtained when another member of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ family of interacting partners _PROTEIN_ was used for bifc assays showing the specificity of the _PROTEIN_ family interaction . additionally we corroborated the feasibility of these _PROTEIN_ interacting partners by analyzing the interaction between _PROTEIN_ and members of the arabidopsis clade a _PROTEIN_ to whom is the closest ortholog . therefore we used _PROTEIN_ and the mutated version _PROTEIN_ corresponding to the same mutation found in the dominant _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants . interestingly we were able to also demonstrate the interaction between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ while the mutation _PROTEIN_ was able to abolish this interaction . these in vivo targeting experiments also determined the subcellular localization of the interaction in both the _LOCATION_ and the _LOCATION_ which is quite similar to that described for _PROTEIN_ . the specific _LOCATION_ localization of the _PROTEIN_ and the rest of the _PROTEIN_ interactions suggest an interesting function for these complexes in aba signaling and aba regulated gene _PROTEIN_ . previously we had shown that was strongly up regulated by aba treatment specifically _PROTEIN_ in aba treated dormant seeds and that this _PROTEIN_ was negatively correlated with germination . the _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ interacting partner _PROTEIN_ displayed a pattern largely opposite to that of and was down regulated by aba . gene _PROTEIN_ analysis using genevestigator software revealed that _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ was strongly down regulated by salt and osmotic stress as well as by aba treatment . in contrast with most of the other _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ members _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ to behave differently in the gene _PROTEIN_ profiles from genevestigator shown in supplemental figure since an increased _PROTEIN_ in response to aba salt osmotic or drought stress is observed . furthermore using the _METHOD_ browser from bar we compared the transcription levels of _PROTEIN_ versus _PROTEIN_ in different plant tissues and developmental stages showing a different _PROTEIN_ pattern _PROTEIN_ in seeds and seedlings which may indicate different functions for some members of this new family . taking into account that homologous genes of the same family usually present functional redundancy to varying degrees we have chosen a gain of function approach to provide genetic evidence on the role of the _PROTEIN_ gene in aba signaling by generating _PROTEIN_ transgenic lines to further analyze the aba responses in them . to this end the coding region of _PROTEIN_ was fused to the cauliflower mosaic virus promoter in the binary vector and the construct was used to transform arabidopsis plants . most of the _PROTEIN_ kanamycin resistant lines recovered showed an aba hypersensitive phenotype to different degrees in seed germination as compared with untransformed plants or plants transformed with the empty vector . for each line seeds were plated on selection medium to test the segregation ratio of kanamycin resistance . finally six homozygous lines were selected and southern blot analysis displayed double and single insertions of the _PROTEIN_ transgene . _PROTEIN_ levels of the _PROTEIN_ transgene in three different lines analyzed by quantitative pcr presented in supplemental figure showed substantially higher _PROTEIN_ compared with wild type plants as expected . out of the homozygous lines obtained three lines with a single insertion were selected for further analysis . the specific interaction of _PROTEIN_ with which is up regulated by aba in beech seeds prompted us to test whether constitutive _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis would affect aba sensitivity in seeds . seed germination of _PROTEIN_ overexpressing transgenic plants in medium supplemented with aba is shown in figure . at d poststratification radicle emergence and development of green and expanded cotyledons was mostly inhibited in _PROTEIN_ seeds at aba while control col seeds showed nearly germination in aba . to further substantiate this result we compared the germination of aba hypersensitive mutants _PROTEIN_ and wild type seeds with that of _PROTEIN_ transgenics in medium supplemented with aba . the addition of aba _PROTEIN_ the percentage of germination in _PROTEIN_ to similar to the germination observed in _PROTEIN_ transgenic lines . clearly under a concentration not completely inhibitory for the wild type _PROTEIN_ overexpressing lines reached less than germination . _PROTEIN_ seeds were unable to germinate and grow under this low aba concentration therefore they showed enhanced sensitivity to aba . mature arabidopsis seeds exhibit primary dormancy when freshly released from the mother plant which means that seeds are unable to germinate under the appropriate environmental conditions unless they are treated with dormancy breaking treatments such as stratification or gibberellins . to determine the degree of dormancy of _PROTEIN_ seeds we compared the germination percentage of the seeds harvested at the same time after different cold treatment periods with that of two wild type plants with different degrees of dormancy and with aba related mutants that produce nondormant seeds _PROTEIN_ . as a result all of the _PROTEIN_ transgenic lines exhibited an enhanced degree of dormancy compared with the col wild type very similar to that of the emkheim ecotype but significantly different from the abi mutants . in the absence of stratification at _PROTEIN_ transgenic seeds were unable to germinate reaching to germination after d of treatment suggesting that this protein may be related to aba regulated dormancy . to fully characterize the hypersensitive phenotype of _PROTEIN_ seeds an additional seed germination assay was carried out in the presence of paclobutrazol a well known inhibitor of ga biosynthesis . gas are antagonistic to aba therefore seeds with reduced sensitivity to aba show paclobutrazol resistant germination . in contrast to the wild type _PROTEIN_ seeds were unable to germinate and develop green cotyledons in medium supplemented with and paclobutrazol indicating that they are more dependent on ga biosynthesis at this developmental stage . these results demonstrate that _PROTEIN_ seeds exhibit an enhanced degree of seed dormancy and sensitivity to inhibition of germination by exogenous aba and paclobutrazol suggesting that _PROTEIN_ might be involved as a positive regulator in aba responsiveness in seeds . it has been suggested previously that aba regulates many different stress responses . to test whether the aba sensitivity induced by overexpression of _PROTEIN_ during germination is also effective against other aba mediated stresses that increase aba levels we analyzed the seed germination response of _PROTEIN_ transgenic lines in the presence of low concentrations of nacl and mannitol and compared it with that of wild type plants . seed germination under mm mannitol and mm nacl leads to a severe delay in radicle emergence and further growth arrest in _PROTEIN_ individuals in contrast wild type seeds were able to germinate and develop green cotyledons under such conditions . these results indicate that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ seeds are neither osmotolerant nor resistant to low salt concentration in this germination assay . to determine the extent to which _PROTEIN_ overexpression could affect whole plant phenotypes we analyzed aba sensitivity in vegetative tissues of the aba related mutant _PROTEIN_ three _PROTEIN_ transgenic lines and wild type plants . aba has an inhibitory effect on root growth and consequently aba insensitive mutants and overexpressing plants are resistant to this aba mediated process . twelve day old _PROTEIN_ seedlings grown in the presence of and aba showed an enhanced inhibition of root growth compared with wild type plants and to a greater extent with that of abi mutants . when grown in the absence of aba the _PROTEIN_ overexpressing plants did not display any visible phenotypic alteration . aba triggers stomatal closure and consequent reduction in water loss under drought conditions . the arabidopsis aba insensitive mutants _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are impaired in the aba induced stomatal closure and therefore in their ability to limit transpiration upon drought . on the contrary _PROTEIN_ overexpression did affect stomatal regulation since _PROTEIN_ plants showed lower rates of transpiration than wild type plants under drought conditions which lost approximately fresh weight after d . to examine whether the enhancement in aba sensitivity in transgenic plants was accompanied by altered _PROTEIN_ of aba responsive genes we compared the _PROTEIN_ of several previously reported aba inducible genes _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ synthase _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ with that of col and _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ is an aba inducible gene whose _PROTEIN_ is drastically inhibited both in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants and accumulation of _PROTEIN_ mrna is induced by drought salinity and aba and is reduced by approximately in the _PROTEIN_ mutant compared with wild type plants . similarly _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are cold drought and aba inducible genes that contain aba responsive elements in their promoters . _PROTEIN_ contains in addition the dehydration responsive element which is involved in a rapid response to conditions of dehydration or high salt . _PROTEIN_ this effect _PROTEIN_ plants behave opposite to the _PROTEIN_ mutant as they showed a high induction in the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ upon aba treatment from that detected in wild type plants . taken together these results indicate that _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in vegetative tissues increases aba responsive gene _PROTEIN_ and is also linked to aba related physiological responses such as enhanced dormancy level stress resistant germination inhibition of root growth and desiccation tolerance . to further assess the real function of _PROTEIN_ in planta and its relevance in the aba signal transduction pathway we generated double transgenic lines that overexpressed both and _PROTEIN_ . functional analysis of these plants has also shown an enhanced response to aba during seed germination and early seedling growth similar to _PROTEIN_ overexpressing lines and greatly different from the aba insensitivity displayed by the gain of function lines or the dominant _PROTEIN_ mutant . these results confirm that _PROTEIN_ is able to antagonize function in the plant .

and compared with the _PROTEIN_ release of the genbank database using blastn . a predicted biological score _PROTEIN_ was applied to assess the reliability of each interaction as described previously . briefly the _PROTEIN_ relies on two different levels of analysis . first a local score takes into account the redundancy and independence of prey fragments as well as the distributions of reading frames and stop codons in overlapping fragments . second a global score takes into account the interactions found in all the screens performed at hybrigenics using the same library . in addition potential false positives are flagged by a specific e _PROTEIN_ . this is done by discriminating prey proteins containing highly connected domains previously found several times in screens performed on libraries derived from the same organism . the _PROTEIN_ scores have been shown to positively correlate with the biological significance of interactions . the coding regions of and _PROTEIN_ were

analysis was performed as described by citation to select lines carrying a single t dna copy . progeny homozygous for kanamycin resistance were used for further studies . the generation of transgenic lines simultaneously overexpressing both and _PROTEIN_ was performed by transferring pollen from _PROTEIN_ lines to emasculated flowers from different overexpressing lines and subsequent selection of the siblings on plates containing kanamycin . coexpression of and _PROTEIN_ in double transgenic plants was verified by pcr analysis using the primer f and those indicated in supplemental table . additionally progeny were analyzed in and aba and properly genotyped in accordance with aba sensitivity . to measure aba sensitivity seeds were plated on solid medium composed of _METHOD_ basal salts glc and different concentrations of aba . for the dormancy assay seed lots to be compared were harvested on the same day from individual plants grown in identical environmental conditions and stratified during and d at . each value represents the average germination percentage of to seeds with the se values of at least three replicates . to determine sensitivity to inhibition of germination by low osmoticum and salt the medium was supplemented with mm mannitol and mm nacl respectively . to measure paclobutrazol sensitivity seeds were plated on medium containing and paclobutrazol . the percentage of seeds that had germinated and developed fully green expanded cotyledons was determined in all assays after d of sowing . the root growth assay for scoring aba sensitivity was done by measuring root growth after d of transferring of d old seedlings onto vertical _METHOD_ plates containing and aba . for the transpiration assays the loss of fresh weight of whole week old plants at the same developmental stage was measured at room temperature after the indicated periods of time . seeds from wild type _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ plants were grown in ml flasks containing ml of _METHOD_ solution and glc . the flasks were shaken at rpm under cool _METHOD_ light . after d seedlings were mock treated or treated with aba during h. plant material was collected and frozen in liquid nitrogen . total rna for quantitative reverse transcription pcr was extracted from arabidopsis d old frozen seedlings using tri reagent as described by the manufacturer . extracted rnas were then subjected to rt . one microgram of dnase treated total rna was used for rt with a superscript kit . the rt product was used for quantitative pcr using the primers designed from the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ genes with the aid of primer _PROTEIN_ software _METHOD_ and listed in supplemental table . the actin gene _PROTEIN_ was used as a control .
