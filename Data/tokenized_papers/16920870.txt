plants are able to integrate exogenous deoxy d xylulose into the methyl d _LOCATION_ phosphate pathway implicated in the biosynthesis of _LOCATION_ isoprenoids . thus the _PROTEIN_ needs to be phosphorylated into deoxy d xylulose phosphate and translocated into _LOCATION_ or vice versa . an enzyme capable of phosphorylating dx was partially purified from a cell free arabidopsis protein extract . it was identified by _METHOD_ _METHOD_ as a _LOCATION_ protein bearing d xylulose kinase signatures already suggesting that dx is phosphorylated within the _LOCATION_ prior to translocation into the _LOCATION_ . the corresponding cdna was isolated and enzymatic properties of a recombinant protein were determined . in arabidopsis xylulose kinases are encoded by a small gene family in which only two genes are putatively annotated . the additional gene is coding for a protein targeted to _LOCATION_ as was proved by colocalization experiments using green _METHOD_ protein fusion constructs . functional complementation assays in an escherichia coli strain deleted in xk revealed that the _LOCATION_ enzyme could exclusively phosphorylate xylulose in vivo not the enzyme that is targeted to _LOCATION_ . xk activities could not be detected in chloroplast protein extracts or in proteins isolated from its ancestral relative synechocystis sp . pcc . the gene encoding the _LOCATION_ protein annotated as xylulose kinase might in _PROTEIN_ yield an enzyme having different phosphorylation specificities . the biochemical characterization and complementation experiments with dx of specific arabidopsis knockout mutants seedlings treated with oxo clomazone an inhibitor of deoxy d xylulose phosphate synthase further confirmed that the _LOCATION_ protein is responsible for the phosphorylation of dx in planta .
enzyme synthesized dx was used to detect dxk activity in crude cell extracts isolated from different _METHOD_ . a recombinant his tagged version of e. coli xk shown to bear dxk activity was used as a positive control . dxk activity could not be detected in s. cerevisiae an organism synthesizing isoprenoids exclusively via mva while all other protein extracts did catalyze the formation of dxp . as dxp is incorporated into the _LOCATION_ mep pathway chloroplast protein extracts were tested as well but no activity could be evidenced . a primary screening of various enzyme sources allowed us to identify arabidopsis and radish total protein extracts as the best candidates to start with plant dxk purification . to facilitate the _PROTEIN_ cloning of the gene encoding dxk and its characterization arabidopsis was chosen as the source of proteins . for purification stability of apparent enzyme activity was tested in preliminary experiments . dxk from arabidopsis was revealed to be heat stable . further attempts to purify the enzyme to a higher degree after the sepharose q column were unsuccessful and led to loss of activity . therefore we decided to identify all proteins contained in the mixture by a proteomic approach . the _METHOD_ blue stained gel revealed about major bands . all spots identified by maldi tof _METHOD_ are listed in figure and corresponded to proteins encoded by the arabidopsis genome . however only one contained the conserved motifs _PROTEIN_ n and _PROTEIN_ c characteristic of a _PROTEIN_ pentose kinase . this enzyme corresponds to a putative xk with a calculated molecular _METHOD_ of d . to confirm that the identified protein bears dxk activity a recombinant his tag enzyme and as its homolog from e. coli were purified using columns . the purity of both recombinant enzymes was greater than as judged by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ with apparent molecular _METHOD_ being close to the calculated values . following the technique described in figure a dxk enzyme assay was performed . in the presence of _PROTEIN_ and the recombinant enzymes were able to catalyze the conversion of dx into a more _PROTEIN_ compound migrating with authentic dxp on a thin layer chromatography plate . the formation of dxp was proven by a coupled spectrometric assay with _PROTEIN_ as described by citation . to compare at dxk with ec dxk some enzymatic properties were determined . we observed that at dxk initially purified from protein extracts was heat stable . thus in a first series of experiments using dx we evaluated enzyme stability of recombinant ec dxk versus at dxk at various temperatures . both enzymes showed more than of the optimum activity between and confirming temperature stability within a broad range . overall in comparison to ec dxk at dxk is the more efficient enzyme . at dxk showed specific xk activity in the presence of _PROTEIN_ as a cosubstrate but also accepted dx albeit at greatly reduced efficiency like its homolog from e. coli . a fold higher affinity was observed for the plant enzyme when d xylulose was used as a substrate and fold when dx was used . while enzyme activity remained stable for several weeks it has to be noted that the km values have to be determined with freshly prepared enzyme fractions as the values slightly increased over storage time . next substrate specificities for nucleoside triphosphate were tested . the given activities were obtained using the radiometric assay and values represent initial velocities calculated from time stop measurements . generally each nucleotide was accepted as a cosubstrate when d xylulose was used as a substrate however their relative efficiency appears quite different . the plant enzyme showed a clear preference for _PROTEIN_ as compared to ec dxk . in the presence of dx instead of d xylulose the activity _PROTEIN_ for both enzymes . however as compared to ec dxk at dxk used exclusively _PROTEIN_ as a substrate . it has to be noted that after a longer incubation time dxp can be formed even if vi is low . a second gene encoding a putative xk was found in the arabidopsis genome . alignment of protein sequences having homologies with xk from different _METHOD_ by the aid of clustalx software indicated there is no significant similarity between both xks . furthermore this protein is more closely related to the well characterized e. coli xk than the enzyme we purified from plant extracts . consequently the corresponding gene was referred to as atxk in comparison to the e. coli gene while the gene encoding the purified dxk was named atxk . a phylogenetic tree constructed with clustalx using the neighbor joining method showed that they have evolved independently . the analyses distinguished three distant groups the first one assembled eukaryotes the second grouped _PROTEIN_ cyanobacteria and the third one joined eubacteria . the arabidopsis proteins confine to two divergent groups atxk clusters with the cyanobacteria group while atxk clusters with proteins present in higher eukaryotic cells . in addition atxk bears a extension in the open reading frame which encodes an additional peptide of amino acids as compared to the synechocystis protein . it was identified as a potential targeting peptide by predotar for prediction of subcellular location with a probability of for chloroplastic targeting and only for mitochondrial targeting . the psort software _METHOD_ predicted the protein to be targeted to the stroma of the chloroplast with a probability of to the mitochondrium and to _LOCATION_ . indeed the protein contained at its c terminus a sgl motif similar to a skl like _LOCATION_ targeting signal type motif . finally target estimated at atxk as a _LOCATION_ enzyme and as a mitochondrial protein . to confirm the function of the putative transit peptide the dna sequence coding for the n terminal propeptide was fused to the end of the gene coding for green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ . transient _PROTEIN_ of the fused _METHOD_ in tobacco cells verified that the peptide was sufficient to target the reporter protein to chloroplasts . the green _METHOD_ colocalized with chloroplasts while control cells _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ solely evidenced a _LOCATION_ localization surrounding them . for comparison a known chloroplast specific transit peptide fused to red _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ was used for colocalization in tobacco by cells and led to the same conclusion . a possible mitochondrial targeting function of the peptide was disproved by transient _PROTEIN_ in tobacco by cells followed by staining of the cells with the mitotracker red cmxros probe . the photographs illustrated that the observed punctuated structures obtained after _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ did not colocalize with the mitotracker demonstrating that the peptide 's only role is targeting into the _LOCATION_ . in addition the hypothesis of atxk being targeted to _LOCATION_ was investigated by colocalization experiments either with the truncated form of atxk fused to the c terminal side of _METHOD_ or its mutated version in which the sgl motif was removed . none of these chimeric proteins colocalized with an _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ skl protein which was taken as reference for peroxisomal labeling . when fused to the n terminus of _METHOD_ the truncated form of the protein starting with _METHOD_ was found in the _LOCATION_ and some cells contained a few protein aggregates within the _LOCATION_ . furthermore _METHOD_ fusion proteins at either the n terminus or c terminus of atxk confirmed that the protein was _LOCATION_ as was expected by the sequence analysis and the purification experiment . in summary the colocalization experiments proved that atxk is a _LOCATION_ protein whereas atxk corresponds to a _LOCATION_ one . further atxk presents no _LOCATION_ domains and apparently corresponds to a stromal protein . if we consider atxk to putatively encode a protein with xk activity the question comes up as to why we did not identify this protein as a dxk . furthermore the possibility of dx phosphorylation by this enzyme would change the sequence of events compared to those expected with the isolated atxk . in this case dx would first be transported into the chloroplasts and then become phosphorylated . does this enzyme bear higher substrate specificity for d xylulose than for dx or is even the catalytic activity completely different ? in vitro activity assays with the recombinant enzyme did not provide evidence for any _PROTEIN_ kinase activity . we tested nearly sugars as potential substrate for atxk but none of them was significantly phosphorylated . because this might have been due to the lack of some unknown cofactor or interaction with other proteins the capacity of atxk to phosphorylate d xylulose in vivo was investigated by functional complementation assays . we took advantage of the _PROTEIN_ that e. coli contains a unique gene encoding xk . a strain was created in which xylb was deleted and replaced by a cat cassette . the deletion did not affect xyl isomerase activity in vivo which was essential for complementation assays . while no obvious phenotype could be detected on rich luria bertani medium the growing capacity of the mutant strain was strongly affected on minimum medium supplemented with xyl . as a control when the medium was supplemented with glc the mutant grew as did the wild type strain . functional complementation assays were performed with the arabidopsis isogenes atxk atxk and xylb . with d xyl as a _PROTEIN_ source and in the presence of mm iptg atxk and xylb could rescue the xylb deficiency whereas the strain transformed with the construct coding for atxk did not grow like the mutant strain transformed with an empty vector . these results suggest that atxk does not code for a xylulose kinase . to prove that atxk is not responsible for the phosphorylation of dx into dxp in planta additional strategies had to be developed as described below . because our studies suggested that at _PROTEIN_ corresponds to a _LOCATION_ enzyme we tested the hypothesis that chloroplast protein extracts catalyze the conversion of d xylulose into xp or dx into dxp . being genetically close to arabidopsis radish which produces considerable plant material within a few days was chosen to verify this hypothesis . stromatal protein extracts were assayed but neither apparent dxk nor xk activity could be evidenced . as atxk bears strong homologies with the synechocystis sp . pcc protein annotated as xk we tested protein extracts from this cyanobacterium for enzyme activities . neither xk nor dxk activities could be detected but enzymatically synthesized d xp was converted into other compounds with distinct rf and therefore different _PROTEIN_ . different ntps were tested but none of them could be utilized to catalyze the formation of dxp or xp . these results demonstrate that in cyanobacteria as well as in chloroplasts there is no xk activity at least not in form of a soluble enzyme . however it can not be excluded that the protein is not _PROTEIN_ or that it is regulated by an unknown mechanism even though the transcripts are detected by reverse transcription pcr in wild type plants . to further prove atxk to be responsible for dx phosphorylation in planta we characterized arabidopsis t dna insertional mutants . mutants were identified in the database from the salk collection . homozygous plants were selected by pcr and sequence analysis of the junction fragments obtained with t dna and gene specific primers identified the t dna insertion in exon for _GENE_ and in exon for _GENE_ . rt pcr analysis indicated that the mrnas were not _PROTEIN_ in the corresponding homozygous mutant plants . no phenotype could be observed under standard culture conditions . using the arabidopsis microarray database genevestigator we checked the _PROTEIN_ pattern of the mrnas transcripts of atxk and atxk atxk is _PROTEIN_ in all organs and tissues though predominantly in leaves and pedicels . atxk is more ubiquitously _PROTEIN_ with a slightly higher _PROTEIN_ level in _PROTEIN_ and stamens . analysis on the _METHOD_ browser _METHOD_ _METHOD_ confirmed these results and showed that atxk _PROTEIN_ is enhanced by drought genotoxic stress or oxidative stress while atxk _PROTEIN_ is stimulated by osmotic stress . for close inspection of biochemical properties in vivo biochemical characterizations were initiated . the presence of xk and dxk activities in _LOCATION_ extracts and _LOCATION_ fractions for each plant type was verified . while in wild type and atxk dna _LOCATION_ plant extracts apparent activities could be detected atxk dna plant extracts were not able to phosphorylate d xylulose or dx . none of the chloroplast fractions was able to phosphorylate the sugars which confirmed the result presented in figure . the tests were performed using _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ ctp or utp as a phosphate donor and resulted each time in a negative enzyme assay . the results are consistent with the _PROTEIN_ that xk is missing in plant chloroplasts and that atxk annotated as xylulose kinase encodes a protein with different yet unknown enzyme activity . as a control it was verified that the chloroplast protein extract was metabolically active using xp as substrate as was the synechocystis extract . to further characterize the biochemical phenotype of mutant plants we tested their capacity to metabolize exogenous sugar added to the culture medium . in vivo atxk knockout mutants as well as wild type columbia were able to use xyl as a _PROTEIN_ source in dark culture conditions . in contrast to this atxk knockout mutants did not germinate in the presence of xyl which was even found toxic as compared to seeds that were allowed to germinate without any sugar . to assess the role of atxk in the phosphorylation of dx in arabidopsis we tested the capacity of wild type atxk dna and atxk dna plants to phosphorylate dx in planta . for this purpose oxo clomazone a bleaching herbicide affecting _PROTEIN_ activity was used to inhibit the mep pathway and thereby the formation of carotene normally protecting photosynthetic reaction centers from photooxidation . we tested the capacity of oc treated wild type and mutant plants to phosphorylate dx into dxp allowing after incorporation the bypass of the inhibition of _PROTEIN_ and consequently a reversion of the bleaching effect of oc . in the first series of experiments we determined the minimal concentration of oc causing a bleached phenotype on arabidopsis seedlings and the dx concentration needed to overcome at least partially the effect . reference concentrations were oc and mm dx . under those conditions a pale green complexion was recovered with wild type and atxk dna plants indicating a partial recovery of the biosynthesis of photosynthetic pigments derived from dxp via the mep pathway . in contrast to this the atxk dna plants remained albino and atxk was unable to take over the function of atxk in the atxk dna knockout mutant . in summary these investigations led us to conclude that atxk is the sole enzyme able to phosphorylate dx in planta .
