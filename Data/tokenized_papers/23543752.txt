formation of clathrin coated vesicles requires the scaffolding _PROTEIN_ protein complexes which are conserved across all eukaryotes . the arabidopsis genome encodes five ap complexes and each complex consists of four subunits . in this study we characterized the poorly defined ap complex by using genetics proteomics and live cell imaging . we showed that the ap _PROTEIN_ subunit _PROTEIN_ was localized to the trans _LOCATION_ network and interacted physically with the ap subunits in arabidopsis . during treatment with brefeldin a the functional fluorophore tagged _PROTEIN_ relocated to the bfa compartment . the _PROTEIN_ loss of function mutant _PROTEIN_ displayed deleterious growth defects which were particularly evident in the compromised cytokinesis that was revealed by the presence of cell wall stubs in multinucleate cells . immunolocalization of the cytokinesis specific syntaxin _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ showed that _PROTEIN_ was mislocalized and aggregated around the division plane while a secretory marker targeting to the cell plate remained unaffected . taken together we propose that the ap complex is required for cell plate targeted trafficking of _PROTEIN_ in dividing plant cells and that it has a common role in mediating plant and yeast/animal cytokinesis _METHOD_ which are fundamentally different .
to be comparable with the nomenclature for ap complexes of the other _METHOD_ the following nomenclature was used for the arabidopsis ap subunit encoding loci _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ locus was formerly denoted as at ad . to better characterize the ap complex we first generated transgenic plants that stably _PROTEIN_ the green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ fusion protein of _PROTEIN_ . the c terminal _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion protein _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was constructed as a genomic fragment and _PROTEIN_ under the native promoter of _PROTEIN_ . anti _METHOD_ immunoblot analysis using the total protein extracted from homozygous seedlings of the transgenic plant detected a single band corresponding to kda which was in agreement with the predicted molecular weight of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . to determine the in vivo ap _PROTEIN_ subunit composition we performed immunoprecipitation using the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgenic plants . total protein extracted from day old seedlings was subjected to anti _METHOD_ immunoprecipitation . the immunoprecipitates were separated by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and stained with _METHOD_ dye or analyzed on anti _METHOD_ immunoblots . the transgenic plant _PROTEIN_ free _METHOD_ was used as the negative control . although free _METHOD_ appeared as a single kda band _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ pulled down an array of immunoprecipitated proteins of various sizes . to determine the identities of proteins in the immunoprecipitates _METHOD_ _METHOD_ analysis was performed with ltq orbitrap on peptides prepared from in gel digestion . after cross checking with the protein pool from the free _METHOD_ control to eliminate unspecific interactors we showed that _PROTEIN_ interacted with five putative ap _PROTEIN_ encoded in the a. thaliana genome . confocal microscopy analysis of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgenic plants revealed that _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ ubiquitously in all tissues . it appeared as mobile punctate structures and diffused _METHOD_ throughout the _LOCATION_ . to determine the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis we followed the co localization if any between _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and the styryl dye which has been widely used as a marker for endocytosis and endocytic vesicle trafficking in living eukaryotic cells because it sequentially labels endomembrane compartments . following intracellular internalization one of the earliest organelles labeled by is the tgn . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ displayed excellent co localization with labeled punctate structures after min of staining . this rapid co localization suggests that _PROTEIN_ may reside on the tgn . to show that this was the case we stained the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ seedlings with for min followed by h of brefeldin a treatment . bfa is a fungal toxin that is known to cause the agglomeration of the tgn and endosomal _LOCATION_ to form bfa compartments in arabidopsis root cells . therefore co localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ with the bfa compartments would support the notion that _PROTEIN_ is localized to the tgn . as expected bfa treatment caused the relocation of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ to the core of bfa compartments that are labeled by . this result was consistent with the rapid co localization between _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and after just min of incubation and strongly indicated that _PROTEIN_ resided on the tgn . notably bfa treatment also diminished all _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ labeled punctate structures and caused the _LOCATION_ pool of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ to _PROTEIN_ . these results indicated that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ trafficking was in a bfa sensitive pathway . next we confirmed the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ by performing a series of co localization experiments using well established _METHOD_ markers . transgenic lines stably _PROTEIN_ each of a tgn marker _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ a _LOCATION_ marker _PROTEIN_ and pre _LOCATION_ compartment markers _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were used for crossing with the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ line . confocal microscopy visualization showed that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ co localized exclusively with _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ no co localization was detected with mcherry _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . furthermore _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was sensitive to the v _PROTEIN_ inhibitor concanamycin a which caused the aggregation of the tgn . taking these results together we concluded that _PROTEIN_ is a tgn localized _PROTEIN_ . to investigate the cellular functions of _PROTEIN_ we isolated the t dna insertion mutant line _PROTEIN_ from the versaille collection to characterize the _PROTEIN_ loss of function mutant . sequencing analysis showed that the t dna was inserted into the sixth exon and reverse transcription pcr analysis indicated that _PROTEIN_ was a null allele . we subsequently renamed _PROTEIN_ as _PROTEIN_ . a homozygous _PROTEIN_ was viable but showed deleterious growth phenotypes . during germination _PROTEIN_ grew normally like the segregating wild type or _PROTEIN_ heterozygous seedlings . at d after germination root elongation and leaf development in _PROTEIN_ were arrested . the _PROTEIN_ seedlings showed distorted apical growth with highly curled leaves and extremely rough and bloated surfaces . while trichomes in _PROTEIN_ were unbranched compared with the wild type the stomata developed normally with the one cell spacing rule strictly obeyed . the _PROTEIN_ plants eventually entered the reproductive stage and generated deformed flowers from which a limited number of seeds were produced . to rule out the possibility that the arrested growth observed in the _PROTEIN_ mutant resulted from the indirect consequences of a second site mutation in unlinked t dna we generated transgenic plants in the columbia background that constitutively _PROTEIN_ an artificial microrna that targeted _PROTEIN_ . these transgenic lines phenocopied the arrested growth observed in _PROTEIN_ . next we attempted to complement the mutant phenotype in _PROTEIN_ by using the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ construct described above . because _PROTEIN_ was sterile and could not be used for transformation experiments we transformed the heterozygous t dna plants _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and genotyped all transformants to identify homozygous _PROTEIN_ . we successfully identified seven transformants that were all _PROTEIN_ homozygous . all _PROTEIN_ homozygotes that harbored _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ showed normal plant growth with no obvious growth defects . therefore complementation of the mutant phenotype in _PROTEIN_ with an exogenous wild type copy of _PROTEIN_ provided unequivocal evidence that deletion of _PROTEIN_ led to growth arrest in arabidopsis and _PROTEIN_ was required for normal plant development from the seedling stage to the mature plant stage . furthermore the complementation of the _PROTEIN_ phenotype by _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ convincingly demonstrated the functionality of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ therefore validating the tgn localization of _PROTEIN_ . given the prominent roles of ap complexes in endosomal trafficking as revealed in mammalian _METHOD_ we first investigated the dynamics of endocytosis in the _PROTEIN_ mutant and in wild type plants . to this end we followed the uptake in a time lapse manner . in wild type _PROTEIN_ / plants reached its final destination at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ after h of incubation at room temperature . however in _PROTEIN_ cells never reached the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ within the same time frame . instead large _LOCATION_ aggregates were formed after min . the uptake of in _PROTEIN_ was not significantly different from that in the wild type plants although a slight delay was observed . this result suggested that _PROTEIN_ was not be directly involved in endocytic uptake at the pm . detailed inspection of the labeled _PROTEIN_ seedlings revealed peculiar structures that accumulated in the cotyledon epidermal cells . these structures were morphologically distinct from the large _LOCATION_ aggregates observed in the root cells and strongly resembled the bfa compartments that represented endomembrane agglomeration in response to bfa treatment . intriguingly we observed a large number of cell wall stubs in the cotyledon of _PROTEIN_ compared with the wild type which suggested that there were defects in cytokinesis . mutants that are defective in cytokinesis are usually characterized by the presence of cell wall stubs and multinucleate dividing cells . to determine if _PROTEIN_ conformed to the criteria of a cytokinesis mutant we examined the ultrastructure of _PROTEIN_ cells by transmission electron microscopy . cell wall stubs were readily detected in the cotyledon and root meristem . free vesicles clustered around the cell wall stubs which resembled those observed in knolle and bfa treated _PROTEIN_ seedlings . in agreement with the cytokinesis defects the curled leaves with rough and bloated surfaces in _PROTEIN_ mutant are likely consequences of the enlarged cell size due to incomplete cytokinesis . the same phenotype had previously been described in other cytokinesis mutants such as knolle keule and hinkel . the syntaxin _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is a cytokinesis specific snare _PROTEIN_ protein that mediates vesicle fusion at the growing cell plate . to facilitate vesicle fusion the protein _PROTEIN_ stabilizes _PROTEIN_ in its open conformation at the cell division plane . the trafficking pathway of _PROTEIN_ during somatic cytokinesis has been mapped out previously . newly synthesized _PROTEIN_ is delivered to the growing cell plate via the secretory pathway on mediating homotypic fusion at the cell plate the _PROTEIN_ is targeted to the _LOCATION_ for degradation by passing through the multivesicular body . because _PROTEIN_ is localized to the tgn which is a sorting station where secretory and endocytic pathways converge it is possible that the _PROTEIN_ scaffolded vesicles may target _PROTEIN_ to the cell plate from the tgn or may remove _PROTEIN_ from the cell plate to the _LOCATION_ . therefore we examined _PROTEIN_ localization in _PROTEIN_ dividing cells by using immunolocalization . in wild type root tip meristematic cells _PROTEIN_ appeared as patches that were scattered in the cytoplasm during metaphase and anaphase . at the onset of telophase and throughout cytokinesis _PROTEIN_ positive signals accumulated predominantly at the growing cell plate until the completion of cell division . in _PROTEIN_ dividing cells the localization pattern of _PROTEIN_ was indistinguishable from that in the wild type control . however during telophase _PROTEIN_ formed large aggregations around the cell plate although in some cases a portion of the _PROTEIN_ positive signals was still localized correctly at the cell plate . aggregation of _PROTEIN_ would eventually lead to the aberrant or incomplete formation of the cell plate throughout cytokinesis . the _PROTEIN_ aggregation observed in the _PROTEIN_ dividing cells was in sharp contrast to the largely unperturbed secretory marker _METHOD_ targeting to the cell plate . by stably _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in the _PROTEIN_ plants _METHOD_ signal was clearly observed at the cell wall stubs indicating that the secretory pathway to the cell plate was normal before cell plate expansion was compromised . therefore we concluded that the _PROTEIN_ loss of function mutation caused the mislocalization of the cytokinesis specific _PROTEIN_ which was responsible for the compromised cytokinesis observed in _PROTEIN_ .
the t dna insertion line _PROTEIN_ was acquired from the _PROTEIN_ collection . arabidopsis thaliana ecotypes columbia and wassilewskija were used as the wild type in this study . immunoprecipitates of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were extracted from day old _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ seedlings using epitope tag protein isolation kits . _METHOD_ _METHOD_ to identify the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ immunoprecipitates was performed as described previously . five day old seedlings were fixed and immunolabeled as previously described . the primary antibody rabbit anti _PROTEIN_ was used at the secondary antibodies goat anti rabbit igg alexa fluor and goat anti rabbit igg alexa fluor were used at . to visualize bfa compartments the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ seedlings were stained with for min followed by h incubation in bfa at room temperature before proceeding to confocal laser scanning microscopy _PROTEIN_ . for concanamycin a treatment seedlings were incubated in concanamycin a for min . to measure endocytosis kinetics wild type _PROTEIN_ / and _PROTEIN_ seedlings were stained for min and samples were immediately imaged with _PROTEIN_ by capturing images at min intervals . confocal images were acquired using a zeiss _PROTEIN_ . for scanning electron microscopy _PROTEIN_ fixation seedlings were incubated in fixation solution overnight at room temperature . fixed seedlings were subjected to serial dehydration in and ethanol for min for each step followed by an overnight dehydration in ethanol . finally the seedlings were coated in gold using a jeol fine coater and imaged with a table top microscope miniscope tm . tem analysis was conducted by the tokai electron microscopy service using chemical fixation . the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ construct was synthesized as follows . a genomic fragment was amplified using primers _GENE_ f and _GENE_ r sequenced and _PROTEIN_ as a _METHOD_ fusion protein from the binary vector . to construct _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ the coding sequence of _PROTEIN_ was amplified using primers _PROTEIN_ f and _PROTEIN_ r and cloned into pentr/d topo sequenced and subcloned into . for semi quantitative rt pcr of _PROTEIN_ primers rt and r were used . for genotyping of endogenous _PROTEIN_ and t dna insertion the primer pairs _PROTEIN_ r and r were used respectively . see supplementary table for primer dna sequences .
