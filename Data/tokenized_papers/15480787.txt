transport of nucleotide sugars across the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ is required for the lumenal synthesis of a variety of essential cell surface components and is mediated by nucleotide sugar transporters which are members of the large drug/metabolite superfamily of transporters . despite the importance of these proteins in plants so far only two have been described _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ from arabidopsis thaliana . in this work our aim was to identify further _LOCATION_ nucleotide sugar transporters from arabidopsis . on the basis of their sequence similarity to _PROTEIN_ we found four additional proteins which we named _PROTEIN_ and . these putative nsts were grouped into three clades _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ with six further uncharacterized proteins . transient _PROTEIN_ in tobacco cells of a member of each clade fused to the green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ suggested that all these putative nsts are localised in the _LOCATION_ . to obtain evidence for nucleotide sugar transport activity we _PROTEIN_ these proteins together with the previously characterised _PROTEIN_ in a gdp mannose transport defective yeast mutant . we tested the transformants for rescue of two phenotypes associated with this mutation sensitivity to hygromycin b and reduced glycosylation of _LOCATION_ chitinase . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ complemented both phenotypes indicating that _PROTEIN_ like the previously characterized _PROTEIN_ is a gdp mannose transporter . _PROTEIN_ and also rescued the antibiotic sensitivity but not the chitinase glycosylation defect suggesting that they can also transport gdp mannose across the yeast _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ but with a lower efficiency . rt pcr and analysis of affymetrix data revealed partially overlapping patterns of _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in a variety of organs . because of the differences in ability to rescue the phenotype and the different _PROTEIN_ patterns in plant organs we speculate that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are both gdp mannose transporters whereas _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ may transport other nucleotide sugars in planta .
to identify candidate _LOCATION_ nsts in arabidopsis the protein and nucleotide sequence databases were searched for proteins closely related to _PROTEIN_ . we selected four predicted proteins for further study which we named _PROTEIN_ and based on their higher sequence similarity to _PROTEIN_ particularly in the predicted nucleotide sugar binding region . cdnas encoding these proteins were cloned by rt pcr from rna isolated from various arabidopsis organs . _PROTEIN_ has six introns and alignment of the cdnas with the corresponding genomic sequences revealed the presence of several introns in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . however both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were found to lack introns . the predicted amino acid sequence of _PROTEIN_ was similar at the n terminus to that of the annotated protein _GENE_ but differed substantially from it at the c terminus . _PROTEIN_ and sequences were identical to the ones predicted . the sequences of the gonst proteins show significant identity over their entire length except that _PROTEIN_ has an n terminal sequence extension . overall sequence identity between the five gonst proteins ranges from to . the gonst proteins have calculated molecular weights ranging from to kda and with the exception of _PROTEIN_ all the proteins have a basic isoelectric point . apart from _PROTEIN_ all the gonst proteins have putative n glycosylation sites . however the locations of these sites are not conserved and most lie within probable _LOCATION_ domains suggesting that they may not be used . hydrophobicity analysis of the gonst protein sequences revealed that they are highly hydrophobic which is consistent with their presumed roles as _LOCATION_ spanning transporters . since the available _METHOD_ are not able accurately to predict _LOCATION_ spanning regions in proteins with multiple transmembrane domains we used the alignment between all the gonst related proteins to identify conserved hydrophobic regions . as predicted for _PROTEIN_ this analysis suggested that they each contain tmds . thus the sequence analysis indicated that _PROTEIN_ were good candidate nsts suitable for further investigation . _LOCATION_ nsts and _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ related proteins are part of the drug/metabolite superfamily of transporters . to investigate their relationship to other nst/tpt related proteins in arabidopsis we generated a phylogenetic tree for _PROTEIN_ together with further homologues in the arabidopsis database . we included the _PROTEIN_ nst family and some phosphate translocator related proteins . this analysis indicated that the five gonst proteins can be grouped into three distinct clades perhaps reflecting a specialisation for the transport of different substrates . _PROTEIN_ clustered with gdp mannose transporters such as _PROTEIN_ and s. cerevisiae . since _PROTEIN_ possesses a putative nucleotide sugar binding gxlnk motif region almost identical to that in _PROTEIN_ we hypothesized that it may be another _LOCATION_ gdp mannose transporter . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ clustered together but outside this clade and are the next most similar proteins encoded in the arabidopsis genome . their relationship to _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and atutr proteins suggested that _PROTEIN_ and could also be _LOCATION_ nsts . _PROTEIN_ and were recently classified in nst subfamily l separately from _PROTEIN_ in subfamily k . _PROTEIN_ is in a distinct clade of seven previously uncharacterised proteins . recently knappe et al . classified this clade as kv/a/g based on the amino acids found after a conserved lysine in these and other nst/tpt related proteins . based on their divergence from known _LOCATION_ nsts and _LOCATION_ transporters we hypothesized that these proteins might have nucleotide sugar or other transport activities in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ or elsewhere in the cell . to determine whether these novel gonst proteins are localised in the _LOCATION_ apparatus as would be predicted of nsts required for cell wall polysaccharide synthesis we generated fusions with the green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ and transiently _PROTEIN_ them in tobacco leaf epidermal cells . previously we have shown that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ is localised to the _LOCATION_ apparatus when transiently _PROTEIN_ in onion epidermal cells . to determine _PROTEIN_ localisation upon transient _PROTEIN_ in tobacco epidermal cells we first _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ together with the _LOCATION_ marker _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and analysed the _METHOD_ with a laser scanning confocal microscope . as expected we found a high level of colocalisation of the two proteins in small punctate structures typical of the _LOCATION_ apparatus which were highly motile in the cytoplasm . we also co _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ with the _LOCATION_ marker sialyltransferase _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and also _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and we obtained a similarly high level of colocalisation in each case . these results indicated that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusions are localised to the _LOCATION_ when transiently _PROTEIN_ in tobacco epidermal cells . to investigate the localisation of _PROTEIN_ homologues in the cell we also visualised the subcellular distribution of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in vivo after transient _PROTEIN_ in tobacco epidermal cells . the punctate distribution of _METHOD_ resembled the pattern seen with the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion . no _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was detected in the _LOCATION_ . to determine whether the proteins were actually localised in the _LOCATION_ apparatus we co _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusions with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusions showed substantial colocalisation with the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ indicating that the _PROTEIN_ and fusions are targeted to the same organelle as _PROTEIN_ . in some cells there were also some smaller motile structures that contained gonst _METHOD_ fusions . the number of these smaller structures increased with _PROTEIN_ level suggesting they could be an artifact of over _PROTEIN_ . figure shows cells co _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ that were treated with brefeldin a . all the labelled structures were sensitive to bfa treatment and in the presence of the drug the _METHOD_ pattern became similar to that of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . together their colocalisation with _LOCATION_ markers and their sensitivity to bfa indicate that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are localised to the _LOCATION_ in plant cells . we were unable despite repeated attempts with various _PROTEIN_ vectors to _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in tobacco epidermal cells suggesting they are not amenable to localisation by fusion to _METHOD_ . to determine if any of the newly identified gonst proteins have nst activity we _PROTEIN_ them in mutant yeast cells that are defective in nucleotide sugar transport . before embarking on the functional characterization we first tested whether the proteins could be successfully _PROTEIN_ in yeast . previously we had shown that _PROTEIN_ could complement a yeast strain . strains are deficient in the ability to transport gdp mannose because of a mutation in the gxlnk motif of and consequently show abnormal sensitivity to hygromycin b . although it is not understood precisely how the hygromycin sensitivity arises since a substantial number of cell wall mannan synthesis mutants acquire this phenotype it is clear that it is a consequence of defects in mannosylation in the _LOCATION_ . _PROTEIN_ cdnas were cloned into pyes a _PROTEIN_ inducible c terminally tagged yeast _PROTEIN_ vector . _PROTEIN_ in pyes was used as a positive control and the pyes dest vector alone was used as a negative control . we were unable to transform and _PROTEIN_ all the gonst proteins in the strain used previously so we transformed the strain which displays normal glycosylation activity in the _LOCATION_ . after growth in galactose containing medium to induce _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ were prepared from the wild type and transformed strains . _LOCATION_ proteins were resolved by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ blotted onto a _LOCATION_ filter and probed with anti antisera . figure shows that the antiserum detected multiple specific bands in lanes containing _LOCATION_ fractions from transformed with the _PROTEIN_ and constructs . these bands were absent in the empty vector control and in the wild type strain and also absent when the cells were grown in _PROTEIN_ containing medium . the apparent molecular weight of the major band detected in each transformant was similar but not identical to the predicted molecular weight of the gonst proteins . these results were confirmed using antiserum raised against the second c terminal epitope . moreover antiserum raised against the n terminal segment of _PROTEIN_ also recognized the same bands in fractions from cells _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ demonstrating that _PROTEIN_ was not truncated at either the n or c terminus . differences between predicted and apparent molecular weights have been observed when other hydrophobic nsts have been _PROTEIN_ in heterologous _METHOD_ . thus we believe that the hydrophobicity of the gonst proteins is the reason for the aberrant mobility . the bands with lower mobility detected by the antisera may correspond to multimeric _METHOD_ of these proteins which did not disaggregate under these electrophoresis conditions . treatment with endoglycosidase h to remove any n linked glycans did not alter the mobility of the gonst proteins indicating that in yeast the proteins are not n glycosylated . in summary all the gonst proteins were _PROTEIN_ in a galactose inducible fashion and targeted to the _LOCATION_ of the mutant strain indicating that these transformed strains were suitable for functional analysis . to investigate nucleotide sugar transport activity of the gonst proteins we first examined their ability to complement the hygromycin sensitivity of the mutant . on _PROTEIN_ and galactose containing media without the antibiotic all the yeast strains grew . in the presence of the antibiotic only the wild type strain grew on control _PROTEIN_ containing medium . interestingly when their _PROTEIN_ was induced with galactose all five gonst proteins complemented the sensitivity of the mutant to hygromycin b . these results indicate that lumenal mannosylation in the yeast _LOCATION_ is stimulated by the _PROTEIN_ of these proteins and suggest that all the gonst proteins are indeed nucleotide sugar transporters . although these data indicate that gdp mannose is a substrate for all the gonst proteins the divergence of their sequences suggested that some may have substrate preferences different from that of _PROTEIN_ . to investigate whether they could all mediate substantial rates of gdp mannose transport we tested the ability of each gonst protein to complement the defect in protein glycosylation seen in the mutant by assaying the electrophoretic mobility of _LOCATION_ chitinase . chitinase is a highly mannosylated protein whose mobility on gels depends on the length of the o linked manno oligosaccharide chains which are extended in the _LOCATION_ apparatus using lumenal gdp mannose . wild type and transformed strains were grown to saturation in induction medium and _LOCATION_ chitinase was isolated from the medium . immunoblot analysis using anti antisera revealed that all five transformed yeast strains _PROTEIN_ gonst proteins in these cultures . in agreement with previous findings chitinase secreted from the empty vector control migrated with a higher mobility than that secreted from the wild type strain as a consequence of its under glycosylation . in contrast a proportion of the chitinase from mutant yeast cells _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ migrated with a lower mobility corresponding to that of fully glycosylated chitinase . chitinase secreted from _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or migrated similarly to the under glycosylated form _PROTEIN_ in the empty vector control . these results indicated that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mediated sufficient transport of gdp mannose across the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ to rescue the chitinase glycosylation defect whereas _PROTEIN_ and did not suggesting that the latter transporters may have other substrate specificities . to determine where the gonst genes are _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis rt pcr analysis was performed on rna extracted from various organs . as shown in table gonst _PROTEIN_ is widespread but shows some organ specificity . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were _PROTEIN_ in all the organs analysed . the ubiquitous _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ found here is consistent with our earlier northern analysis and _PROTEIN_ promoter gus fusion assays . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were detected in all organs except roots whereas _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ only in siliques flowers and rosette leaves . analysis of affymetrix data for gonst gene _PROTEIN_ in roots callus rosette leaves and _METHOD_ revealed a similar trend of _PROTEIN_ supporting the conclusions based on the rt pcr survey . however _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was not detected in affymetrix data for any organs suggesting that the level of _PROTEIN_ of these genes is lower than the detection threshold of this method . interestingly in the affymetrix pollen data no signal was detected from any gonst genes indicating little or no _PROTEIN_ in this cell type . the partially overlapping _PROTEIN_ patterns suggest that there is functional redundancy among the gonst proteins or that they may have different transport specificities .
