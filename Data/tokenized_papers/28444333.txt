members of the protein disulfide isomerase c subfamily are chimeric proteins containing the thioredoxin domain of pdis and the conserved n and c terminal pfam domains of _LOCATION_ type cargo receptors . they are unique to plants and chromalveolates . the arabidopsis genome encodes three pdi c _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . here we demonstrate that _PROTEIN_ is a kda integral _LOCATION_ glycoprotein _PROTEIN_ throughout many arabidopsis tissues . using a _PROTEIN_ specific antibody we show through immunoelectron microscopy that _PROTEIN_ localizes to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ in wild type root tip cells and was also detected in vesicles . tomographic modeling of the _LOCATION_ revealed that _PROTEIN_ was confined to the cis _LOCATION_ and accumulated primarily at the cis most cisterna . shoot apical meristem cells from transgenic plants overexpressing _PROTEIN_ exhibited a dramatic increase in anti _PROTEIN_ labeling at the cis _LOCATION_ . when n or c terminal fusions between _PROTEIN_ and the green _METHOD_ protein variant _METHOD_ were _PROTEIN_ in mesophyll protoplasts the fusions co localized with the _LOCATION_ marker _LOCATION_ mcherry . however when _METHOD_ was positioned internally within _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ the fusion strongly co localized with the cis _LOCATION_ marker mcherry _PROTEIN_ and faintly labeled the _LOCATION_ . in contrast to the _LOCATION_ resident fusion protein _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ did not redistribute to the _LOCATION_ after brefeldin a treatment . protease protection experiments indicated that the trx domain of _PROTEIN_ is located within the _LOCATION_ lumen . we propose a model where pdi c _METHOD_ function as cargo receptors for proteins containing exposed cysteine residues cycling them from the _LOCATION_ back to the _LOCATION_ .
arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ possesses a standard pdi c domain arrangement consisting of two tmds an _LOCATION_ n domain a catalytic trx domain and a _PROTEIN_ coated _LOCATION_ domain . the two tmds flank a large central loop harboring the arrangement a where and correspond to the strand rich regions of the _LOCATION_ n and _PROTEIN_ coated _LOCATION_ domains respectively . the _PROTEIN_ gene does not appear to be essential as arabidopsis knockout mutants harboring t dna insertions in exon _PROTEIN_ and intron _PROTEIN_ of the gene are viable and do not display an obvious mutant phenotype under normal growth conditions . the lack of an overt phenotype associated with the loss of _PROTEIN_ may be due in part to functional redundancy with two other pdi c _METHOD_ in arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . we have previously shown that of the three pdi c genes in arabidopsis the _PROTEIN_ promoter exhibits the broadest and highest levels of _PROTEIN_ according _PROTEIN_ promoter fusion studies . we therefore focused our attention on the characterization of _PROTEIN_ . a polyclonal rabbit antiserum was generated and affinity purified against a truncated version of _PROTEIN_ . western blot analysis confirmed that the affinity purified antibody was capable of detecting a recombinant version of the central loop region of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . to determine the arabidopsis tissues in which _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ proteins were extracted from various tissues of wild type and _PROTEIN_ mutant plants . the anti _PROTEIN_ antibody prominently detected a protein of approximately kda in wild type cotyledons leaves roots flowers expanding green siliques and etiolated seedlings and weakly detected a kda protein in mature dry siliques . transgenic plants ectopically _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ under the strong quasi constitutive cauliflower mosaic virus promoter _PROTEIN_ displayed increased abundance of the kda protein confirming that the detected protein corresponded to the gene product of _PROTEIN_ . the kda protein was not detected by western blot in tissue samples obtained from _PROTEIN_ knockout mutants except in cotyledons where a faint band of similar size was observed . thus _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ at detectable levels across many diverse tissues of arabidopsis . the faint band observed in cotyledons may be due to the anti _PROTEIN_ antibody cross reacting with _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ although the strong detection of the kda protein in wild type tissues relative to comparable _PROTEIN_ mutant tissues indicates that the contribution of cross reaction from _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in our western blot analyses is relatively minor . in addition the lack of cross reaction of the anti _PROTEIN_ antibody with other proteins in the _PROTEIN_ mutant tissues verifies the antibody s specificity . although the observed molecular weight of _PROTEIN_ is kda its predicted molecular weight by amino acid sequence is only kda . since _PROTEIN_ contains five asn x ser/thr sequons that can potentially serve as sites for asparagine linked glycosylation the possibility of _PROTEIN_ being a glycoprotein was examined . proteins extracted from _PROTEIN_ seedlings were treated with the broad spectrum endoglycosidase peptide n glycosidase f which removes n linked glycan chains by cleaving the bond between asparagine and n acetylglucosamine . comparison of pngase f treated and untreated protein samples by western blot revealed that endoglycosidase treatment resulted in a significant downward shift in _PROTEIN_ s gel mobility indicating that n glycosylation contributes to the higher than predicted molecular weight of _PROTEIN_ . to examine the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ in living plant cells constructs were generated for the transient _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ fused to the green _METHOD_ protein variant _METHOD_ . to account for the possibility of _METHOD_ interfering with sorting signals located proximal to the n or c terminus of _PROTEIN_ three versions were created _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ which _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ tagged to the n terminus of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ which _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fused to the c terminus of _PROTEIN_ with the very end of _METHOD_ modified to include the potential _LOCATION_ retrieval sequence of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in which _METHOD_ was placed internally within _PROTEIN_ immediately infront of its catalytic a domain . arabidopsis leaf mesophyll protoplasts were co transfected with the _METHOD_ fusions in combination with _LOCATION_ mcherry a marker for the _LOCATION_ lumen consisting of the red _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ variant mcherry fused at the n terminus to the signal peptide of a. thaliana wall associated kinase and modified at the c terminus to include the _LOCATION_ retention signal hdel . as a control the _LOCATION_ mcherry marker was also co _PROTEIN_ with _METHOD_ that was not fused to _PROTEIN_ . the distribution patterns of the _METHOD_ protein fusions were visualized by laser scanning confocal microscopy . protoplasts _PROTEIN_ the unfused _METHOD_ control exhibited diffuse labeling in both the _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ which did not resemble the endomembrane network signal pattern of _LOCATION_ mcherry . in contrast _LOCATION_ mcherry _METHOD_ strongly overlapped with the labeling patterns of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ indicating that the two _PROTEIN_ fusions localized to the _LOCATION_ . interestingly protoplasts transfected with the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ construct displayed a labeling pattern that was very different from those of the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusions . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ localized to punctate structures with the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signals in close proximity to the _LOCATION_ mcherry marker . faint _LOCATION_ labeling by _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was also detected . to determine the nature of the punctate signals produced by _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in protoplasts the localization pattern of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was examined in relation to markers for _LOCATION_ and the _LOCATION_ . _METHOD_ protein fusions to the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ subunit _PROTEIN_ accumulate at _LOCATION_ when _PROTEIN_ in tobacco leaf epidermal cells . when the _LOCATION_ marker mcherry _PROTEIN_ was co _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in arabidopsis leaf protoplasts we observed that the two fusions displayed punctate signal patterns that were proximal but mostly non overlapping indicating that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ did not strongly accumulate at _LOCATION_ . for visualization of the _LOCATION_ we utilized two markers . _METHOD_ protein fusions to the n terminus of the syntaxin _PROTEIN_ localize to the cis _LOCATION_ whereas c terminal fusions to full length mannosidase i or the first amino acids of mani are described as accumulating in the early compartments of the _LOCATION_ . co _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and mcherry _PROTEIN_ in protoplasts revealed that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ strongly co localized with the cis _LOCATION_ marker . in contrast we observed that when _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was co _PROTEIN_ with the second _LOCATION_ marker mcherry the punctate _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and mcherry signals were closely adjacent to each other but displayed very little overlap . although mani _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ were described as localizing to the cis half of the _LOCATION_ due to their incomplete co localization with the trans _LOCATION_ marker _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ immunoelectron microscopy studies have shown that in plants native mani primarily localizes to the medial _LOCATION_ cisternae . therefore the lack of signal overlap between _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and mcherry suggests that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ localizes specifically to the cis _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ whereas mcherry primarily accumulates at the medial _LOCATION_ . the fungal lactone antibiotic brefeldin a is often used to study _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ trafficking due to its disruptive effects on the eukaryotic secretory pathway . specifically bfa prevents the formation of _PROTEIN_ coated vesicles by inhibiting type _PROTEIN_ exchange _PROTEIN_ which catalyze the activation of adp ribosylation _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ a _PROTEIN_ required for the recruitment of _PROTEIN_ coat proteins to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . in addition to blocking the formation of _PROTEIN_ vesicles bfa also causes certain _LOCATION_ compartments to fuse with neighboring _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ leading to an apparent redistribution of several _LOCATION_ markers to the _LOCATION_ . for example the _LOCATION_ marker mani _METHOD_ localizes to both an _LOCATION_ like network and pleiomorphic aggregates when _PROTEIN_ in tobacco bright yellow cells treated with ml bfa . to determine what effect bfa treatment would have on the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protoplasts _PROTEIN_ both the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and mcherry fusions were treated with ml bfa or ml bfa . interestingly whereas protoplasts treated with bfa displayed an _LOCATION_ like redistribution of mcherry the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion exhibited a highly punctate signal pattern in both untreated and bfa treated protoplasts . in summary our transient _PROTEIN_ experiments indicated that the position of the _METHOD_ tag in fusions to _PROTEIN_ influences the subcellular targeting of the protein . n terminal and c terminal _METHOD_ fusions were retained in the _LOCATION_ while the internal _METHOD_ fusion was directed primarily to the cis _LOCATION_ with only a low level of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ detected at the _LOCATION_ . whereas treatment of the protoplasts with bfa caused the _LOCATION_ resident fusion protein mcherry to redistribute to the _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ retained a punctate localization pattern after bfa treatment . to achieve higher resolution of the subcellular distribution pattern of _PROTEIN_ transmission immunoelectron microscopy analyses were performed using the _PROTEIN_ specific antibody in conjunction with arabidopsis tissue sections preserved by high pressure freezing/freeze substitution . this approach has two major advantages over the protoplast transient _PROTEIN_ system . in addition to enabling localization at higher resolution than possible by confocal microscopy the anti _PROTEIN_ antibody can be used to detect native protein thereby avoiding the problem of protein sorting being affected by epitope or _METHOD_ protein tags . in wild type arabidopsis root tip cells anti _PROTEIN_ immunogold labeling was detected at the cis side of _LOCATION_ stacks and at the _LOCATION_ . quantitation of anti _PROTEIN_ labeling across micrographs revealed an average of immunogold particles per micrograph with of anti _PROTEIN_ labeling at the _LOCATION_ and at the _LOCATION_ . we did not observe labeling of the _LOCATION_ or _LOCATION_ in control experiments when the anti rabbit igg secondary antibody was used alone or when the anti _PROTEIN_ antibody was used on root tip sections of the _PROTEIN_ knockout mutant . these controls indicate that the immunolabeling obtained with the anti _PROTEIN_ antibody on transmission electron microscopy sections was specific for _PROTEIN_ . since the addition of an hdel _LOCATION_ retention signal at the very c terminus of _METHOD_ causes the modified protein to accumulate in the _LOCATION_ and cis _LOCATION_ we compared the distribution patterns of _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ hdel to determine if they localize to identical subcellular structures . when root tip sections obtained from _METHOD_ hdel transgenic plants were co incubated with immunogold labeled anti _PROTEIN_ and anti _METHOD_ antibodies both antibodies were detected at the _LOCATION_ and cis _LOCATION_ as anticipated . anti _PROTEIN_ immunogold labeling of the root tips of _PROTEIN_ overexpression lines revealed a similar staining pattern to that observed in wild type roots . interestingly while we did not observe a dramatic increase in _LOCATION_ labeling by anti _PROTEIN_ in root tip cells anti _PROTEIN_ labeling of the _LOCATION_ in shoot meristematic cells was greatly increased . however we did not observe a comparable increase in anti _PROTEIN_ labeling of the _LOCATION_ in the _PROTEIN_ shoot meristematic cells . occasionally anti _PROTEIN_ labeling was observed in vesicles located proximal to the cis face of the _LOCATION_ consistent with the size and appearance of _PROTEIN_ coated vesicles . in arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ vesicles are larger than _PROTEIN_ vesicles and they exhibit differential staining patterns . the vesicle in fig . has a diameter matching those of _PROTEIN_ vesicles when examined by electron tomography . we also detected anti _PROTEIN_ labeling in smaller vesicles located at the peripheral edges of cis _LOCATION_ cisternae which may correspond to _PROTEIN_ coated vesicles . because _PROTEIN_ has two tmds the anti _PROTEIN_ labeling of the _LOCATION_ was examined in further detail with respect to lumen vs. _LOCATION_ labeling . measurement of the distances of anti _PROTEIN_ immunogold particles from the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ showed that the majority of particles were located proximal to the _LOCATION_ . in contrast gold particles labeled with an antibody recognizing the soluble _LOCATION_ lumen chaperone binding protein did not show a strong association with the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . the observed association of _PROTEIN_ with the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ is consistent with the prediction that _PROTEIN_ has two tmds and is therefore an integral _LOCATION_ protein . in the _LOCATION_ anti _PROTEIN_ was primarily observed at the cis side of the organelle . to define precisely the localization pattern of _PROTEIN_ within the _LOCATION_ immunolabeled serial thin sections of an entire _LOCATION_ stack were used to generate an electron tomography model depicting the distribution of anti _PROTEIN_ immunogold particles across the cis _PROTEIN_ medial and trans _LOCATION_ cisternae . based on the tomographic model _PROTEIN_ was almost exclusively located at the cis _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ . quantification of the distribution of anti _PROTEIN_ labeling over multiple _LOCATION_ stacks indicated that approximately of immunogold particles were present at the cisterna and approximately at the _PROTEIN_ cisterna . the strand rich regions and single trx domain of _PROTEIN_ are located on a large central loop that is flanked on both ends by tmds . to address whether the trx central loop of _PROTEIN_ is _LOCATION_ or lumenal protease protection experiments were performed using microsomal _LOCATION_ isolated from _PROTEIN_ plants . when proteins extracted from _PROTEIN_ seedlings were separated into soluble and microsomal _LOCATION_ fractions by centrifugation _PROTEIN_ was detected exclusively in the _LOCATION_ fraction . treatment of the _LOCATION_ fraction with proteinase k resulted in a slight downward shift in the apparent _METHOD_ of _PROTEIN_ . this is consistent with an expected kda _PROTEIN_ in _METHOD_ if the central loop of _PROTEIN_ is lumenal and thus protease protected while the short n and c terminal tails of _PROTEIN_ are _LOCATION_ and therefore vulnerable to digestion by proteinase k . disruption of the _LOCATION_ by the addition of triton x rendered the central loop of _PROTEIN_ susceptible to proteinase k mediated degradation confirming that the central loop is only resistant to protease degradation in the presence of intact microsomal _LOCATION_ . combined with our immunolocalization results these findings indicate that the catalytic a domain of _PROTEIN_ is located within the lumen of the _LOCATION_ and cis _LOCATION_ cisternae .
