the genome of the nucleorhabdovirus maize fine streak virus consists of nucleotides of nonsegmented negative sense single stranded rna . the antigenomic strand consisted of seven open reading frames and transcripts of all orfs were detected in infected plants . and had significant similarities to the nucleocapsid protein glycoprotein and polymerase genes of other rhabdoviruses respectively whereas the and proteins had no significant similarities . the n and proteins localized to _LOCATION_ consistent with the presence of _LOCATION_ localization signals in these proteins . likely encodes the _PROTEIN_ protein based on its size the position of its nls and the localization of _METHOD_ protein fusions to the _LOCATION_ . probably encodes the phosphoprotein because like the p protein of sonchus yellow net virus it was spread throughout the cell when _PROTEIN_ alone but was relocalized to a subnuclear locus when coexpressed with the mfsv n protein . unexpectedly coexpression of the mfsv n and p proteins but not the orthologous proteins of synv resulted in accumulations of both proteins in the nucleolus . the n and p protein relocalization was specific to cognate proteins of each virus . the subcellular localizations of the mfsv and proteins were distinct from that of the synv protein suggesting different functions . to our knowledge this is the first comparative study of the cellular localizations of plant rhabdoviral proteins . this study indicated that plant rhabdoviruses are diverse in genome sequence and viral protein interactions .
nucleotide sequence of mfsv.the mfsv genome sequence was obtained by assembling sequences derived from the overlapping sequences of randomly primed cdna clones five rt pcr products and two _PROTEIN_ products . the mfsv genome consisted of nucleotides and seven orfs on the antigenomic strand . the sequence of the end of the mfsv genome was determined by _PROTEIN_ and that of the end was determined by _PROTEIN_ and rlm _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ pcr products were cloned and inserts of all six clones were identical indicating that the end of the mfsv genome was ugugugguuuuucccacugc . the sequences of inserts of four _PROTEIN_ and rlm _PROTEIN_ clones were identical indicating that the end of the mfsv genome was gcaguaaaaaaacggacaca . identical and end sequences using either poly or poly _PROTEIN_ were obtained at the university of wisconsin . these results led to the conclusion that the mfsv genomic rna had a nt leader region preceding the leader n intergenic sequence and a nt trailer region following the l trailer intergenic sequence . comparison of the and ends of the mfsv genomic rna revealed that of nucleotides were complementary and might give rise to a putative panhandle structure . similar structures were reported for synv lnyv and ncmv . in addition the first nt of the leader sequence had a high u residue content similar to those described for synv rysv ncmv and lnyv . although the plant rhabdoviruses share complementarity of their and ends and have similar nucleotide biases these sequences did not have significant sequence identity among rhabdoviruses . gene junctions of the mfsv genome.the mfsv orfs were separated by gene junctions with the consensus sequence uuuauuuuguaguug . this sequence was broadly conserved among plant and animal rhabdoviruses and was divided into three distinct motifs the sequences corresponding to the ends of mrnas the intergenic sequences and the sequences corresponding to the ends of mrnas . the corresponding sequences of mfsv mrna ends were a/u rich and nucleotides in length and only the trailer junction had nucleotide differences from the consensus sequence . the intergenic sequence gaug was conserved in all gene junctions of mfsv however this sequence was not conserved among rhabdoviruses . the transcription start site consisted of nucleotides and only the mrna start site had a single nucleotide change relative to the consensus sequence uug . the mfsv transcription start site was identical to those of other rhabdoviruses _PROTEIN_ except for the two cytorhabdoviruses ncmv and lnyv . transcription start sites of the mfsv g and l genes.rlm _PROTEIN_ was used to confirm the sequences of the putative transcription start sites for the mfsv g and l genes . the sequences of six rlm _PROTEIN_ products for the g gene were identical . the sequences of four rlm _PROTEIN_ products for the l gene were identical while the sequences of two others differed from these at position . these data are consistent with the putative uug transcription start sites identified in fig . . however the ends of transcripts contained a nucleotide a that does not correspond to the viral genomic sequence . whether the single nucleotide change at the third nucleotide found in two l gene rlm _PROTEIN_ clones was due to true variability in the l gene mrnas is not known . analysis of the mfsv orf sequences.the predicted proteins encoded by the seven mfsv orfs were examined for sequence similarity to other proteins in the ncbi genbank nonredundant database using blastp . the deduced protein sequence of had significant similarity to the n proteins of rysv synv and ncmv . the protein sequence had significant similarity to those of the g proteins of rysv and synv and the protein sequence had significant similarity to those of the l proteins of synv rysv and other nonsegmented negative sense rna viruses . thus based on sequence similarity mfsv and likely encode the n g and l proteins respectively . the and protein sequences did not show any significant similarities to other rhabdovirus proteins or other sequences in genbank . the protein sequences of mfsv and other nucleorhabdoviruses were searched for domains and motifs including nlss glycosylation sites n terminal signal peptides and transmembrane domains . putative nlss were found at amino acid positions to of the n protein at positions to of the protein and at positions to of the protein whereas no nlss were identified in the mfsv g and l proteins . the synv n and m and rysv n proteins also had putative nlss in the _PROTEIN_ regions but no putative nls was identified in the rysv m protein . similar to other rhabdovirus g proteins the putative mfsv g protein apparently has abundant glycosylation signals . eight potential glycosylation signals were located at amino acid positions to to to to to to to and to . the mfsv g protein also had an n terminal signal peptide sequence and a putative cleavage site between amino acid positions and . furthermore a transmembrane domain was identified at amino acid positions to . other predicted proteins of mfsv did not have abundant glycosylation sites signal peptide sequences or transmembrane domains . detection of mfsv orf transcripts in plants.to test whether all the identified orfs in the mfsv genome are transcribed northern blots of total rnas from healthy and mfsv infected maize were hybridized with probes corresponding to each orf . transcripts of expected sizes that corresponded to each of the seven orfs were detected in mfsv infected maize whereas no hybridization occurred with rna from healthy maize . several rnas hybridized to the probe with the size of the largest matching the expected size of the transcript . the predicted length of gene is nt and a transcript of bp hybridized to the probe . the predicted length of gene is nt and a transcript of bp hybridized to the probe . to exclude the possibility of rna degradation a blot that was hybridized with the probe was subsequently probed with the probe . as expected the resulting blot showed two distinct hybridized bands . these results demonstrated that seven distinct transcripts were present in mfsv infected maize and that these transcripts corresponded to the seven putative genes identified in the mfsv genome . subcellular localization of the mfsv proteins.nlss were identified in three of the seven mfsv orfs and _LOCATION_ localization was demonstrated for the synv n and m proteins . to determine the subcellular localization of the mfsv proteins we used in planta localization and colocalization of _METHOD_ protein fusions . full length orf sequences were introduced into binary pgd derivatives for a. tumefaciens mediated agroinfiltration of n. benthamiana leaves and subsequent in planta production of mfsv proteins fused at the n terminus to _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ . agroinfiltration of _METHOD_ protein fusions of mfsv n and proteins showed that _METHOD_ mfsv n _METHOD_ mfsv and _METHOD_ mfsv accumulated in the _LOCATION_ whereas _METHOD_ mfsv spread throughout the cell and _METHOD_ mfsv accumulated in punctate loci in the cytoplasm . these results were consistent with the prediction of nlss in the mfsv n and proteins . when leaves were coinfiltrated with mixtures of agrobacteria harboring _METHOD_ mfsv n and _METHOD_ mfsv fusions both fusions colocalized to the subnucleus . however unlike the synv n and p proteins the mfsv n and proteins localized to the nucleolus . to confirm the nucleolar localization we coexpressed _METHOD_ mfsv n and _METHOD_ mfsv with the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ that localizes to the nucleolus in a. thaliana and n. benthamiana epidermal cells . this result confirmed that _METHOD_ mfsv n and _METHOD_ mfsv targeted the same subnuclear locale as _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ which is in the nucleolus . finally we determined whether coinfiltration of _METHOD_ protein fusions of the mfsv n protein and the synv p protein allowed redirection of _LOCATION_ synv p protein to the subnuclear locale similar to coexpression of the synv n and p proteins . coinfiltrated _METHOD_ mfsv n and dsred synv p did not interact to target a subnuclear locale but looked very similar to dsred synv p infiltrated alone . similar results were obtained when _METHOD_ synv n was coinfiltrated with _METHOD_ mfsv . these data suggest that the interaction of n and p proteins leading to subnuclear targeting is virus specific .
