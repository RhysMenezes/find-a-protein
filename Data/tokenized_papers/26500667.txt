_LOCATION_ in the leaf epidermal cells of plants are _PROTEIN_ as immature chloroplasts that like mesophyll chloroplasts undergo binary fission . while mesophyll chloroplasts have generally been used to study _LOCATION_ division recent studies have suggested the presence of tissue or _LOCATION_ type dependent regulation of _LOCATION_ division . here we report the detailed morphology of _LOCATION_ and their stromules and the intraplastidic localization of the chloroplast division related protein in the leaf epidermis of an arabidopsis mutant that harbors a mutation in the chloroplast division site determinant gene _PROTEIN_ . in _PROTEIN_ the size and shape of epidermal _LOCATION_ varied widely which contrasts with the _LOCATION_ phenotype observed in _PROTEIN_ mesophyll cells . in particular _PROTEIN_ epidermal _LOCATION_ occasionally displayed grape like morphology a novel phenotype induced by a _LOCATION_ division mutation . observation of an _PROTEIN_ transgenic line harboring an _PROTEIN_ promoter _PROTEIN_ yellow _METHOD_ protein fusion gene confirmed the _PROTEIN_ and _LOCATION_ localization of _PROTEIN_ in the leaf epidermis . further examination revealed that constriction of _LOCATION_ and stromules mediated by the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ contributed to the _LOCATION_ pleomorphism in the _PROTEIN_ epidermis . these results illustrate that a single _LOCATION_ division mutation can have dramatic consequences for epidermal _LOCATION_ morphology thereby implying that _LOCATION_ division and morphogenesis are differentially regulated in epidermal and mesophyll _LOCATION_ .
leaf epidermal _LOCATION_ are relatively small and underdeveloped _METHOD_ compared with mesophyll chloroplasts . these _LOCATION_ are often present in dumbbell or peanut shaped form . the number shape size and intracellular distribution of the leaf epidermal _LOCATION_ in wt observed in the present study were basically in accordance with previous reports _PROTEIN_ . dual detection of stroma targeted _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ in a transgenic line revealed that the peanut shaped _LOCATION_ in the leaf epidermis were associated with the production of centrally located _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signals within the _LOCATION_ . this result indicates that these _LOCATION_ were in the process of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mediated symmetric division in a similar manner to mesophyll chloroplast division . nevertheless epidermal _LOCATION_ displayed a greater tendency to form stromules and thus a higher plasticity in envelope morphology than mesophyll chloroplasts . while a detailed model of mesophyll chloroplast division has been proposed _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ which is _PROTEIN_ based on thorough observations of mutants and transgenic lines with altered chloroplast size and number no such model has been established for non mesophyll _LOCATION_ as morphological studies of each type of _LOCATION_ have not previously been performed . to gain insight into epidermal _LOCATION_ division we conducted intensive observations of _LOCATION_ morphology in the leaf epidermis of the a. thaliana _PROTEIN_ mutant one of the most severe mutants of chloroplast division . the _PROTEIN_ mutant harbors a t dna insertional mutation at intron of the _PROTEIN_ locus resulting in approximately fold reduction in the _PROTEIN_ transcripts as compared to those in wt . taking advantage of the merits of _LOCATION_ targeted _METHOD_ described above we investigated the _LOCATION_ morphology in leaf petiole epidermis of and week old _PROTEIN_ seedlings using _METHOD_ microscopy . while epidermal cells of the leaf blade are puzzle piece shaped with interdigitated lobes those of the petiole assume a flat rectangular shape making them more suitable for the observation of _LOCATION_ and other organelles . first we focused on the morphology of individual _LOCATION_ . even in the same cell _LOCATION_ were highly polymorphic in _METHOD_ of their subplastidic structures such as _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ bodies stromules and bulges . importantly it was often difficult to distinguish among these three structures which is often the case for non green _LOCATION_ . nonetheless we typically observed giant _LOCATION_ with long stromules . as variations of this typical form we observed shallow wavy constrictions on stromules and seemingly fragmenting stromules . these stromules often contained substructures resembling _LOCATION_ bodies in their interior or terminal regions . these characteristic morphologies of stromules were observed _PROTEIN_ of the presence of chlorophyll _METHOD_ in their _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ bodies . the _PROTEIN_ mutant also exhibited a unique morphological feature in the _LOCATION_ bodies of the leaf epidermis . at low frequency mini sized _LOCATION_ bodies aggregated into a grape like clump . in some cases some of the _LOCATION_ bodies within a clump emitted faint chlorophyll _METHOD_ . also we noticed the presence of relatively immature chlorophyll free _LOCATION_ like those observed in the leaf epidermis of the a. thaliana _PROTEIN_ mutant _PROTEIN_ . this type of _LOCATION_ assumed various shapes appearing round stretched or with multiple constrictions . we did not detect a significant relationship between _LOCATION_ size and shape except for the predominance of a round form among small poorly developed _LOCATION_ . another phenotype that is unique to the _PROTEIN_ epidermis among chloroplast division mutants examined thus far is the presence of mini sized chlorophyll containing _LOCATION_ . tiny _LOCATION_ in the epidermis of chloroplast division mutants which were previously reported lacked chlorophyll _PROTEIN_ . _LOCATION_ morphology in leaf epidermis of _PROTEIN_ . images of _METHOD_ labeled _LOCATION_ in leaf petiole epidermis of or week old _PROTEIN_ seedlings . _METHOD_ images of chlorophyll are also shown . asterisks indicate _LOCATION_ bodies with positive chlorophyll signals . _LOCATION_ in lack signals . bars and . in summary we detected novel unique phenotypes of leaf epidermal _LOCATION_ in _PROTEIN_ which have not been reported in other a. thaliana mutants that exhibit severely impaired chloroplast division . these phenotypes include the formation of grape like _LOCATION_ clusters and tiny _LOCATION_ with positive chlorophyll _METHOD_ signals while _PROTEIN_ epidermal _LOCATION_ also exhibited enlarged _LOCATION_ bodies and excessive stromule formation both of which are common phenotypes of non green _LOCATION_ in severe chloroplast division mutants . these results imply that the latter common phenotypes reflect the fundamental effects of inhibited division whereas the former unique phenotypes represent an additional effect that depends on the specific function of _PROTEIN_ or the severity of inhibited division . next we examined the _LOCATION_ morphology in the leaf petiole epidermis of _PROTEIN_ in light of their size number and distribution within each cell . we found several _LOCATION_ size number and distribution patterns a single cell could contain only one giant _LOCATION_ one giant _LOCATION_ coexisting with tiny _LOCATION_ or some _LOCATION_ bodies connected by stromules forming a network throughout the entire length of the petiole epidermal cell . these patterns are basically in agreement with the findings of a previous report on the _PROTEIN_ mutant _PROTEIN_ . moreover we occasionally detected a cell containing dumbbell shaped chlorophyll bearing _LOCATION_ a novel feature of _PROTEIN_ . in general only giant _LOCATION_ which appeared to be produced via inhibited _LOCATION_ division appeared to contain chlorophyll in the _PROTEIN_ epidermis although there were some exceptions . the existence of dumbbell shaped chlorophyll bearing _LOCATION_ implies that some of these chlorophyll containing _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ the capability of proliferation by division . various types of _LOCATION_ morphology and distribution patterns in leaf epidermis of _PROTEIN_ . images of _METHOD_ labeled _LOCATION_ in leaf petiole epidermis of or week old _PROTEIN_ seedlings . dic and chlorophyll _METHOD_ images are also shown . asterisks indicate _LOCATION_ with chlorophyll signals only within cells while double arrowheads indicate cell _LOCATION_ . single arrowheads and boxes represent _LOCATION_ bulges associated with _LOCATION_ bodies or stromules and their activated regions respectively . inset in is a _METHOD_ image of a chlorophyll positive _LOCATION_ pair taken using a shorter exposure time . bars and . measurement of _LOCATION_ morphologies in wt and _PROTEIN_ . phenotypes of epidermal _LOCATION_ in week old seedlings were classified into three groups single _LOCATION_ network and grape like . the former group was further examined with respect to total _LOCATION_ length . _LOCATION_ length was defined as the length of the longest line passing over the _LOCATION_ area . since the borders between _LOCATION_ bodies and stromules were often unclear in _PROTEIN_ the _LOCATION_ length includes the area of stromules _PROTEIN_ . while exploring how and why the heterogeneity of _LOCATION_ shape and size in each individual cell was generated in _PROTEIN_ we noticed bulge or vesicle like subplastidic structures attached to the _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ bodies or stromules . these structures usually underwent transformation even during short observation periods but they remained firmly attached to other parts of the _LOCATION_ . we frequently observed that the generation of such bulge like structures was strongly activated in a confined region of _LOCATION_ . in all images shown in figures all of the bulge or vesicle like structures and their accompanying _LOCATION_ bodies or stromules were located in the same focal plane . notably those bulges appeared to emerge from a single point although no discrete structure was identified . these observations suggest that the grape like _LOCATION_ clusters represent an extreme state resulting from strong activation of bulge and/or vesicle formation . figure shows an example of a _LOCATION_ cluster juxtaposed with the cell _LOCATION_ . indeed _LOCATION_ bodies stromules and bulges were often located near _LOCATION_ in the leaf epidermal cells of _PROTEIN_ . taken together these findings demonstrate that the leaf epidermis of _PROTEIN_ is characterized by a heterogeneous cell population containing various types of _LOCATION_ morphology and distribution patterns . the findings described above demonstrate that leaf epidermal _LOCATION_ in _PROTEIN_ could assume various shapes . a sub population of the _LOCATION_ and their substructures closely resembled mitochondria . indeed the size and shape of stromules and mitochondria their resemblance to each other and even the potential relationships between these structures have been discussed previously _PROTEIN_ . to investigate the possible relationship between subplastidic structures and mitochondria we employed a transgenic a. thaliana line which stably _PROTEIN_ both _LOCATION_ targeted _METHOD_ and _LOCATION_ targeted _METHOD_ as well as _PROTEIN_ harboring both marker genes _PROTEIN_ . using these lines we conducted simultaneous detection and morphological comparisons of both organelles . no colocalization of _METHOD_ signals from grape like _LOCATION_ clusters giant _LOCATION_ or stromules with _METHOD_ signals from mitochondria in _PROTEIN_ was observed as was the case for _LOCATION_ bodies and stromules of wt . meanwhile due to the higher surface area of _LOCATION_ in the mutant attachment of mitochondria to _LOCATION_ was more frequently observed in _PROTEIN_ than in wt . although the bulge structures which were attached to the _LOCATION_ bodies or stromules most closely resembled mitochondria their _METHOD_ signals did not perfectly coincide with mitochondrial _METHOD_ signals indicating that these subplastidic structures and mitochondria were mutually discrete compartments . simultaneous detection of _LOCATION_ and mitochondria in leaf epidermis of _PROTEIN_ . images of _LOCATION_ and mitochondria in leaf petiole epidermis of or week old _PROTEIN_ seedlings . images of _LOCATION_ targeted _METHOD_ chlorophyll mitochondria targeted _METHOD_ and merged _METHOD_ _METHOD_ are shown . bars . at present we can not completely exclude the possibility that the occurrence or dynamics of bulge formation might be regulated by mitochondria through their contact with _LOCATION_ . in the current study however we did not find any significant association between _LOCATION_ structures and mitochondrial morphology/localization . since the coincidental behavior of stromules and the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ has been reported the interaction of _LOCATION_ and their derived structures including stromules with other organelles still deserves further investigation in future studies . to elucidate the relationship between the mutant phenotypes and the function of _PROTEIN_ it is important to examine whether _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ in leaf epidermal cells . to investigate the _PROTEIN_ profile of _PROTEIN_ in planta we previously performed gus staining using transgenic a. thaliana plants harboring an _PROTEIN_ upstream genomic sequence uida fusion _PROTEIN_ revealing that gus activation occurred strongly in the shoot apex and moderately in green tissues and pollen but not in roots in most transgenic plants . one exceptional line _PROTEIN_ exhibited gus staining in whole plants including roots and we recently considered the possibility that this exceptional transgenic line might represent _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in light of a comprehensive a. thaliana transcriptome study and a study of non photosynthetic _LOCATION_ of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . we constructed an _PROTEIN_ promoter _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion gene and introduced it into the _LOCATION_ genome of _PROTEIN_ via agrobacterium mediated transformation . the complemented _PROTEIN_ transgenic plants if obtained would produce almost wt levels of _PROTEIN_ fused to a visual reporter subjected to control at the transcriptional splicing translational and post translational levels . _PROTEIN_ and function of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in _PROTEIN_ . domain structure of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . three regions of _PROTEIN_ an s/t rich n terminal region an e. coli amd like region and an e. coli _PROTEIN_ like region as well as a linker sequence between _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ are indicated . quantitative rt pcr analysis . rnas from leaves of wt _PROTEIN_ and transgenic _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were analyzed . relative amounts of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ transcripts compared to rrna are shown . immunoblotting . proteins from seedlings of wt and transgenic _PROTEIN_ plants were analyzed using mouse anti _METHOD_ and anti actin antibodies . chemiluminescent signals of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and non specific extra signals are indicated at the right . complementation of plant phenotype of _PROTEIN_ by _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . one month old wt _PROTEIN_ and a complemented plant are shown . complementation of _LOCATION_ morphology of _PROTEIN_ by _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . images of chlorophyll _METHOD_ from epidermal and cortex _LOCATION_ of wt _PROTEIN_ and transgenic _PROTEIN_ plants are shown . arrowheads represent epidermal _LOCATION_ . bar . _METHOD_ stereomicroscopy . a complemented _PROTEIN_ line at both the vegetative and reproductive stages was observed . images of bright field _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and chlorophyll _METHOD_ are shown . arrowheads indicate accumulation of _METHOD_ signals at the shoot apices . bars mm and . localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signals in leaf epidermal _LOCATION_ . _METHOD_ images of _METHOD_ and chlorophyll in a leaf epidermal cell of the complemented _PROTEIN_ line are shown . bar . we obtained lines with bialaphos resistance conferred by the t dna . of these two lines showed complemented phenotypes showed partially complemented phenotypes nine showed phenotypes that were defective in _LOCATION_ division site placement and two showed no effects based on observations of epidermal _LOCATION_ and cortex chloroplasts in leaf petioles . we chose one division site placement defective line and one complemented line for further study . quantitative rt pcr analysis revealed that the former had more than fold higher levels of _PROTEIN_ transcripts _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ compared to wt while the latter had an _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ level approximately twice that of wt . no marked differences in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were detected in the plants examined . we examined the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ by western blotting using an anti _METHOD_ antibody . in both transgenic lines a major band was specifically detected at kda which roughly corresponds to the expected size of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . the intensity of the _PROTEIN_ kda band in the overexpression line was fold higher than that of the complemented line . furthermore several high molecular weight proteins were _PROTEIN_ in the overexpression line suggesting that overexpression of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ could result in the formation of stable _PROTEIN_ dimers or multimers of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or heteromeric complexes with its interacting proteins . these results indicate that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was synthesized in these lines as intended . the overexpression of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ might have been caused by positional effects of transgene insertion on the chromosomes of transgenic plants . at the macro morphological level the inflorescence _METHOD_ of _PROTEIN_ exhibited reduced gravitropism and an early flowering phenotype flowering days earlier than wt under our experimental conditions although plant morphology and reproduction in this mutant are normal . this gravisensitivity of _PROTEIN_ showed consistency with the reported phenotype of _PROTEIN_ another mutant of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . restored gravitropism and flowering time were observed in both the complemented and overexpression lines . we investigated the extent of complementation of the _PROTEIN_ phenotype by observing chlorophyll _METHOD_ in leaf petioles . in wt epidermal _LOCATION_ were uniformly sized with a spherical or dumbbell shaped appearance . by contrast most epidermal _LOCATION_ of _PROTEIN_ were relatively large and heterogeneously sized . in both the complemented and overexpression lines the _LOCATION_ morphology in the petiole epidermis was similar to that of wt but the _LOCATION_ size in the latter was weakly heterogeneous . in the leaf petiole cortex _PROTEIN_ chloroplasts were enlarged with no detectable constriction sites as described previously while those of the overexpression line were elongated and had multiple constriction sites indicative of defects in division site placement . the overexpression of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ could have disrupted division site placement via the _PROTEIN_ mediated mechanism . in the petiole cortex of the complemented line the chloroplast phenotype conferred by the _PROTEIN_ mutation was almost restored to the wt phenotype with respect to their size morphological uniformity and the absence of multiple constrictions although their chloroplasts were only slightly larger than those of wt . taken together these results indicate that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ plays a role equivalent to that of the native _PROTEIN_ and exhibits a relationship between gene _PROTEIN_ level and chloroplast phenotype as previously demonstrated . therefore the complemented _PROTEIN_ transgenic line is useful for analyzing _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in situ . we examined this line at the vegetative and reproductive stages by _METHOD_ stereomicroscopy . _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was detected in all organs examined cotyledons leaves _METHOD_ roots floral organs _PROTEIN_ and ovules . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was also _PROTEIN_ in pollen grains . importantly intense _METHOD_ signals were detected at the apical regions of both shoots and roots and the _METHOD_ intensities gradually declined as the organs or tissues matured . these _METHOD_ _METHOD_ patterns in seedlings and floral organs spatially overlapped with the gus _PROTEIN_ data although newly observed signals were present in roots and were faint and broadly distributed within each organ . while validating the newly detected _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ patterns in the complemented line we observed chloroplasts at the basal regions of the _PROTEIN_ epidermis . the morphological phenotype of chloroplasts was restored to that of wt with concomitant _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in the cells . these results indicate that _PROTEIN_ is globally _PROTEIN_ in vegetative and reproductive plant organs and is _PROTEIN_ at high levels in young tissues with maximum _PROTEIN_ occurring in the shoot apex . we further examined the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in leaf epidermal cells of the complemented plants . _METHOD_ signals were exclusively localized to _LOCATION_ with diffuse signals present throughout an area of deeply constricted organelles . the morphological phenotype of the _LOCATION_ was restored to that of wt with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ detected within the _LOCATION_ . altogether these results demonstrate that the role of _PROTEIN_ is intimately associated with _LOCATION_ division and morphogenesis in the leaf epidermis and its deficiency causes abnormal _LOCATION_ phenotypes likely as a direct consequence rather than a secondary effect . moreover this new information about _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in a. thaliana also suggests that the _LOCATION_ phenotypes observed in diverse tissues of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ may be closely associated with the role of _PROTEIN_ in these tissues . in mesophyll chloroplasts of wt a. thaliana plants _PROTEIN_ is involved in the formation of the mid chloroplast ftsz _PROTEIN_ an early event in chloroplast division . in _PROTEIN_ in enlarged mesophyll chloroplasts of the _PROTEIN_ mutant _PROTEIN_ fails to assemble into a mid chloroplast _PROTEIN_ but instead _METHOD_ various structures such as multiple dots short filaments and small isolated _PROTEIN_ . in this study we examined the localization of _PROTEIN_ in the _PROTEIN_ leaf epidermis using a transgenic line in which the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion was _PROTEIN_ under its own promoter . previously we observed multiple _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in mini sized _LOCATION_ bodies in the _PROTEIN_ leaf epidermis . here by simultaneously utilizing _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and stroma targeted _METHOD_ we further monitored _PROTEIN_ localization within stromules and bulges in addition to _LOCATION_ bodies . _PROTEIN_ localization in stromules and _LOCATION_ bulges in leaf epidermis of _PROTEIN_ . dual detection of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and stroma targeted _METHOD_ in epidermal _LOCATION_ of _PROTEIN_ leaf petioles . _METHOD_ images of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ chlorophyll and merged _METHOD_ _METHOD_ are shown . in line profiles of normalized _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ signal intensity in left and right stromules in the image are also presented . single arrowheads indicate position of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ placement while box in highlights _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ placement at stromules or between _LOCATION_ body and _LOCATION_ vesicle within a grape like _LOCATION_ association . arrows and a double arrowhead in indicate a _LOCATION_ constriction event by time lapse microscopy and the position of cell _LOCATION_ respectively . bars and . in many cases the signal intensity of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was weak . like stroma targeted _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ appeared to accumulate much more strongly in the _LOCATION_ bodies than in stromules probably reflecting differences in stroma volume . in those _LOCATION_ we did not find any characteristic structures of _PROTEIN_ in their bodies and stromules except for unfixed dots which were occasionally observed . while we detected apparent disconnection and constriction of the stromal _METHOD_ signal within a single stromule no particular ftsz structure was associated with these disconnected or constricted parts of stromules . in certain cases however _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were observed in stromules . as chloroplast division progresses the appearance of chloroplast ftsz _PROTEIN_ under a _METHOD_ microscope changes from two dots or a filament to a single patch _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . since stromules are very thin ftsz _PROTEIN_ in stromules are considered to be equivalent to those at a _PROTEIN_ or final stage of normal chloroplast division . therefore it was not easy to discriminate between _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and non _PROTEIN_ structures in stromules and thus we relied on the following criteria for discrimination when in focus in the top focal plane of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ the diffusion signal of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ dropped at the flanking regions while the stromal _METHOD_ signal dropped at the site of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ formation both due to the presence of a _PROTEIN_ associated isthmus . for reference the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in wild type dividing _LOCATION_ obviously met these criteria . in light of these criteria in the _LOCATION_ shown in figure at least four _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were recognized in the two stromules emanating from the single body . as shown in figures _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were not necessarily associated with the constricted/disconnected parts of stromules . however in some cases unfixed dots of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were observed within the diffusion signal . most of these _PROTEIN_ dots could be distinguished from _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ based on the above criteria . in the _PROTEIN_ leaf epidermis we also observed a putative _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ at one or more constriction site of the _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ bodies . in such _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signals were concentrated either in a short filament traversing the shallow constriction or in a spot at the deep constriction in addition to the stromal diffusion signal . since epidermal _LOCATION_ in _PROTEIN_ are highly irregular and pleomorphic it was previously difficult to judge whether such a _LOCATION_ was undergoing fission merely based on its shape . it is noteworthy that the use of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in combination with stromal _METHOD_ enabled us to identify epidermal _LOCATION_ undergoing fission . based on the above observations together with our previous findings we postulate that even without _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ could assemble into a _PROTEIN_ in non swollen _LOCATION_ bodies stromules and bulges and the formation of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ could lead to constriction and ultimately _LOCATION_ fission of those _LOCATION_ compartments . while we have provided evidence for postulate postulate has yet to be verified experimentally . to address this issue we performed time lapse _METHOD_ imaging of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ according to the method of demonstrating that _LOCATION_ bodies were capable of isthmus formation and constriction without _PROTEIN_ . intriguingly as exemplified by the _LOCATION_ shown in figure the constricting isthmus of _LOCATION_ bodies often appeared to lack a clear _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . in leaf epidermal _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ formation may not be a prerequisite for the constriction of _LOCATION_ bodies . within grape like _LOCATION_ aggregations putative _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were observed in the narrow stromule like regions of bulges whereas the vast majority of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was detected as a diffuse signal within the _LOCATION_ stroma . the apparent aggregations of _LOCATION_ that occasionally occurred in the _PROTEIN_ leaf epidermis may have resulted from the failure of the stroma containing bulges to separate the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in the _LOCATION_ aggregations might represent suspended _LOCATION_ fission . in other words the _LOCATION_ aggregate might in _PROTEIN_ represent a single or a few _LOCATION_ inside which a number of bulges formed and grew rather than a product of _METHOD_ connection or aggregation of independent _LOCATION_ bodies and bulges . based on our detection of _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and time lapse imaging of _LOCATION_ we conclude the following in the _PROTEIN_ leaf epidermis the formation of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ can occur both within non giant _LOCATION_ bodies and within _LOCATION_ bulges and stromules . deep _LOCATION_ constrictions with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ can be generated in two ways either by constriction of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in the _LOCATION_ bodies or by sustained presence of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in the bulges/stromules in conjunction with the growth of both sides of the _PROTEIN_ . because of depletion of _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ at deep constrictions can inefficiently mediate the scission of _LOCATION_ envelope _LOCATION_ and as a result may help stabilize the constrictions by counteracting the swelling and deformation of _LOCATION_ bodies bulges or stromules . epidermal _LOCATION_ replicate by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ associated binary fission in the same manner as mesophyll chloroplasts . despite this the effects of a mutation in _PROTEIN_ on _LOCATION_ division and morphology differed markedly even in the same leaf depending on tissue type . our present data provide insight into the process by which epidermal _LOCATION_ become pleomorphic . first our observations indicate that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mediated _LOCATION_ constriction occurs in stromules bulges and small _LOCATION_ bodies but not in giant _LOCATION_ in the absence of _PROTEIN_ although it remains unknown whether the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is actually capable of stromule fission . the above data support our previously proposed hypothesis that excessive expansion of _LOCATION_ may inhibit ftsz based constriction while _LOCATION_ with a small diameter and stromules may be capable of efficient constriction . second this study suggests that _PROTEIN_ can assemble into a _PROTEIN_ and produce a _LOCATION_ constriction even without _PROTEIN_ but it appears unable or scarcely able to complete _LOCATION_ fission in the complete absence of _PROTEIN_ . this finding implies that there is a novel mine independent mode of _LOCATION_ division/constriction which might be specific to the epidermal or non green tissue . such _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ at the _LOCATION_ constrictions may play an envelope tightening or holding role in the _PROTEIN_ deficient epidermis . it is possible that the mine independent mode is also present in stromules in the epidermis of wt plants but is hidden perhaps due to the relatively low number and short length of the stromules in wt or to the completion of stromule fission by the functional _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ which would produce difficult to identify _LOCATION_ derived structures . in this context it is interesting that detachment of a vesicle like _LOCATION_ from the tip of the stromule a process known as tip shedding was previously observed in trichome cells of tomato using video microscopy with differential interference contrast optics _PROTEIN_ . assuming the above hypotheses are correct we can explain the terminal phenotype of _LOCATION_ morphology in the _PROTEIN_ epidermis as the following stromule derived subcompartments model stromules and bulges emanating from giant _LOCATION_ undergo ftsz based constriction to produce even smaller subcompartments while the giant _LOCATION_ bodies _METHOD_ can not constrict due to their large diameter these smaller subcompartments undergo further rounds of constriction producing still more subcompartments these subcompartments may continuously grow wider or longer whereas the pre existing constrictions largely remain unchanged due to the presence of static _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and the above steps are repeated in epidermal cells giving rise to a population of _LOCATION_ with rapidly increasing shape heterogeneity . this model would also explain how the grape like _LOCATION_ clusters could be generated from a single or a few _LOCATION_ while such images are usually interpreted as the aggregation and connection of several independent _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . as another example the _LOCATION_ image in figure may have been interpreted as multiple _LOCATION_ connected by stromules according to the conventional viewpoint _LOCATION_ . however based on the new viewpoint this image can be interpreted as a single giant _LOCATION_ whose stromules have grown into subplastid bodies or bulges . localization of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ at the constriction sites of _LOCATION_ bulges and stromules also supports the present stromule derived subcompartments model rather than the conventional connected _LOCATION_ model .
