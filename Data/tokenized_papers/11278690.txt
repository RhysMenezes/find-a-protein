a kda clpp protease complex with different subunits was identified in chloroplast of arabidopsis thaliana using blue native gel electrophoresis followed by _PROTEIN_ assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight and nano electrospray tandem _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . the complex was copurified with the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and all identified clp subunits show chloroplast targeting signals supporting that this complex is indeed localized in the chloroplast . the complex contains chloroplast encoded _PROTEIN_ and six _LOCATION_ encoded proteins as well as two unassigned clp homologues _PROTEIN_ . an additional clp protein was identified in this complex it does not belong to any of the known clp genes families and is here assigned . _PROTEIN_ and accumulation of several of these clp proteins have never been shown earlier . sequence and phylogenetic tree analysis suggests that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and are not catalytically active and form a new group of clp higher plant proteins orthologous to the cyanobacterial clpr protein and are renamed _PROTEIN_ and respectively . we speculate that _PROTEIN_ and are part of the heptameric _PROTEIN_ whereas is a regulatory subunit positioned at the axial opening of the clpp/r core . several truncations and _LOCATION_ in intron and exon prediction of the annotated clp genes were corrected using _METHOD_ _METHOD_ data and by matching genomic sequences with cdna sequences . this strategy will be widely applicable for the much needed verification of protein prediction from genomic sequence . the extreme complexity of the chloroplast clp complex is discussed .
to identify protein complexes that are peripherally attached to _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ we first purified fairly large quantities of _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ from mature leaves of arabidopsis thaliana . the chloroplast stroma is reported to contain mm which is needed to keep the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ in its physiologically stacked state and to stabilize several known complexes such as ribosomes . therefore the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ were kept in a medium containing all throughout the preparation as we expected that this could enhance binding and stability of _LOCATION_ associated protein complexes . the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ were purified on linear percoll gradients to minimize contamination with other _LOCATION_ or organelles . to release peripherally attached _LOCATION_ complexes we attempted treatment with very low levels of nonionic detergents and treatment by yeda press both followed by differential centrifugation . we will not further report on the detergent extraction since this did not result in the purification of significant amounts of novel stable peripheral complexes . instead we report on the purification of complexes using yeda press . _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ were fragmented by yeda press treatment and the _LOCATION_ were subsequently removed by ultracentrifugation . the remaining supernatant was concentrated and loaded on blue native gels to separate the native protein complexes according to their molecular _METHOD_ . high molecular _METHOD_ markers were run in parallel to estimate the molecular _METHOD_ of the peripheral complexes . at the end of the electrophoretic run three focused protein complexes were visible in the region of kda and their estimated molecular _METHOD_ were and kda . gel lanes were then excised and incubated in _PROTEIN_ and the complexes were separated into their individual subunits by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . fig . show a silver stained and _METHOD_ stained gel of the and kda region . in this molecular _METHOD_ range we detected two dominant complexes and one complex of lower abundance . protein spots of each of the three complexes were picked from the gels and prepared for _METHOD_ _METHOD_ analysis . protein spots from the gels were digested with trypsin and the generated peptides were extracted and analyzed by maldi tof _METHOD_ to identify the protein in each spot the experimentally determined peptide _METHOD_ were used to search the public sequence data bases . the largest complex was rubisco with the large _PROTEIN_ and small subunit and the complex at kda was the _PROTEIN_ synthase complex _PROTEIN_ . in the third low abundant complex of kda we could distinguish clearly seven protein spots after silver staining . these seven spots as well as the gel material in between the spots were excised such that nine slices covering the range of kda were collected . maldi tof _METHOD_ spectra were obtained from all of them resulting in the identification of at least one protein per gel slice . from the maldi tof _METHOD_ data it became clear that the kda complex contains several clp proteins suggesting we had purified a chloroplast clp complex with several _METHOD_ . to obtain further confirmation of these identities and to search for additional proteins in the spots the remainder of each peptide extract was analyzed by nano electrospray _METHOD_ to generate sequence tags . the precursor and fragment ions _METHOD_ were then used to search ncbi directly . additionally all _METHOD_ spectra were interpreted into amino acid sequences to search the arabidopsis data base with fasta and thus to allow for _LOCATION_ in gene annotation . to illustrate this identification process the maldi tof _METHOD_ spectrum and some of the _METHOD_ spectra obtained from spot is shown in . fig . a shows the maldi tof spectrum from spot number which contained a mixture of four different clp proteins . in the spectrum we annotated monoisotopic _METHOD_ in the m/z region from to . nine experimental peptide _METHOD_ matched to the protein and covered in total of the primary sequence . the more intense matching peptides are indicated in the spectrum . ten of the peptides in the maldi spectrum matched to the _PROTEIN_ protein providing a sequence coverage of . also _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ protein was identified with confidence in this protein spot as five peptides matched with coverage . finally the maldi data indicated the possible presence of a fourth clp protein _PROTEIN_ but since only three experimental peptides matched this identification clearly needed confirmation . none of the experimental peptide _METHOD_ matched to the predicted signal peptides of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in agreement with the notion that processing of the chloroplast transit peptide of all _LOCATION_ encoded proteins occurs rapidly . after the maldi tof analysis the remainder of the extracted peptides were analyzed by tandem _METHOD_ . fig . b shows the full scan spectrum in the _METHOD_ mode of spot . in the electrospray spectrum doubly charged as well as triply charged peptides were detected . several of these multiple charged peptides were further fragmented along the protein backbone by collision induced dissociation . fig . c shows the _METHOD_ spectrum of the doubly charged peptides at m/z . the complete y ion series could be assigned as indicated . the experimentally determined peptide sequence matched to _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ ofarabidopsis . this identification was further confirmed by another sequence tag from the triply charged peptide withm/z . the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ analysis of the nine spots resulted in the positive identification of different clp proteins . in this section we will briefly describe their identification . at this point it is important to comment on the nomenclature of the clp proteins in higher plants . in agreement with a suggestion for nomenclature of chloroplast proteases we have renamed a number of the clp genes based on the presence of functional domains and conform the homology to e. coliand synechocystis clp genes . this is summarized in table i and in the section below . one accession number per clp protein is indicated in the _PROTEIN_ part of table i redundant entries are listed as footnotes and discrepancies between the sequences are noted . the region between and kda was divided completely in nine individual slices . since the spots are very close to each other and in some cases clearly overlapping it is not surprising that indeed overlap in identities between neighboring spots was found . spots and are the most intensely stained spots both with silver and _METHOD_ staining . spot contained the chloroplast encoded subunit _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ which was identified by six matching peptides maldi tof _METHOD_ with a total coverage of and confirmed by one sequence tag . spot contained _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ as well as _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and a new clp protein here assigned . these three proteins were identified by maldi tof and confirmed by _METHOD_ . in addition we identified _PROTEIN_ by one sequence tag which was further strengthened by three matching peptide _METHOD_ detected by maldi tof _METHOD_ . spots and contained _PROTEIN_ with four matching peptides providing of coverage and confirmed by five sequence tags as well as _PROTEIN_ identified by three sequence tags . _PROTEIN_ was also identified in spots by several sequence tags as well as five matching peptides in maldi tof _METHOD_ spot contained _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ as determined by eight matching peptides with of coverage and confirmed by three sequence tags . _PROTEIN_ is interesting in that it has lost its catalytic site and was therefore renamed as clpr . spots and have a partial overlap . spot contained mostly _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ as was evident from eight matching peptides providing of coverage and confirmed by four sequence tags . in addition this protein spot also contains some as identified by _METHOD_ . spot contains _PROTEIN_ with nine matching peptides with of coverage confirmed by one sequence tag _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ with nine matching peptides with of coverage and with nine matching peptides of coverage and confirmed by one sequence tag . finally spot had a partial overlap with spot and contained _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ was identified by seven matching peptides in maldi tof _METHOD_ covering of the predicted sequence and was confirmed by a sequence tag in _METHOD_ . during the identification process of the clp genes we encountered several discrepancies between the experimentally determined amino acid sequences and the predicted proteins from genomic sequence . therefore all predicted sequences were searched against the est data bases to verify if these discrepancies result form incorrect intron/exon boundary prediction and also to identify possible discrepancies resulting from sequencing _LOCATION_ . such mistakes in protein prediction were found in case of clps as well as other clp proteins not present in the complex and after correction the experimentally determined amino acid sequences matched to the predicted proteins . to arrive at the correct protein sequence of three stretches of protein sequence were removed and three stretches of sequence were inserted or added to the c terminus . two of the experimentally determined sequences overlapped with the inserted amino acid sequence . after this correction the predicted protein increased from amino acid residues to amino acid residues thus adding kda to the predicted molecular _METHOD_ . in case of amino acids were added to the c terminus of the predicted protein sequence . to ensure and demonstrate that we were able to discriminate between the different clpp and clpr proteins we aligned the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ proteins and we have indicated the matching amino acid sequence tags determined by _METHOD_ . clearly the _METHOD_ tags were unique for each protein and combined with the corresponding maldi tof _METHOD_ analysis this shows that the proteins were positively identified with high certainty . the alignment also demonstrates the extent of conservation and the presence _PROTEIN_ or absence _PROTEIN_ of the catalytic triad . shows no strong homology and _METHOD_ quite distant from the other identified clp genes in the complex and was therefore not included in the alignment . from the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ analysis we determined that the kda complex is a clp protease complex with one chloroplast encoded subunit _PROTEIN_ and nine _LOCATION_ encoded subunits . all the _LOCATION_ encoded proteins are synthesized as precursor proteins with an n terminal chloroplast signal peptide which is cleaved off after import into the chloroplast . the chloroplast signal peptide has a number of distinct features but no conserved primary sequence and can be used to predict chloroplast localization with moderate to good confidence . to evaluate the chloroplast localization of the identified clp proteins the primary amino acid sequences were analyzed by the localization prediction _METHOD_ targetp and predotar . all identified clp genes except _PROTEIN_ were predicted to be chloroplast localized by targetp with high degree of confidence . since _PROTEIN_ is clearly part of the same complex as the other subunits it was surprising to find that this protein is predicted to be in the mitochondria . however blast searching with this arabidopsisprotein identified several ests from rice barley and wheat assembly of several overlapping ests for each of these plant species resulted in the identification of three clp genes with high homology toarabidopsis _PROTEIN_ . targetp predicted that all three proteins are localized in the chloroplast whereas the arabidopsis gene was predicted to be in the mitochondria . the alignment strongly suggests that the arabidopsis protein sequence in the data base is truncated at the n terminus in the chloroplast transit peptide . we could not identify an est covering the n terminus and the genome sequence allows for several possible initiating methionines . with the search program predotar _PROTEIN_ of wheat and barley were also predicted to be localized in the chloroplast whereas the rice protein was predicted to be neither in the chloroplast nor in the _LOCATION_ . after the corrections of the predicted protein sequence from genomic nucleotide sequence data and removal of the predicted transit peptide most of the predicted molecular _METHOD_ fitted with the position on the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ gel . this further strengthened all identifications as well as the chloroplast localization . however the predicted size of _PROTEIN_ which was identified by a strong set of _METHOD_ data _METHOD_ to be several kda larger than expected from the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ gel and warrants further analysis . additionally the sequence alignment in fig . indicates that _PROTEIN_ has an extended n terminal region as compared with the other clpp and clpr proteins but no cdna sequence data are available to verify the n terminus of _PROTEIN_ .
a. thaliana ecotype columbia was grown on soil in a temperature controlled growth chamber under a h light dark cycle at light/dark temperatures at a light intensity of about of photons . leaves from arabidopsis were homogenized in ice cold medium a filtered through four layers of miracloth and centrifuged for min at g. _LOCATION_ pellets were resuspended in medium a and centrifuged on a percoll gradient in medium a for min at g. the _LOCATION_ band was collected and washed three times in the same medium a. _LOCATION_ were passed twice through the yeda press and _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ were subsequently removed by ultracentrifugation . the _LOCATION_ free supernatant was collected and concentrated to mg . samples were then mixed with an equal volume of mm caproic acid mmbis tris ph glycerol _METHOD_ brilliant blue g and separated on gradient blue native gels at . molecular _METHOD_ complexes ranging from to kda were loaded for calibration of the gels . gel lanes were then cut out and equilibrated twice for min in _PROTEIN_ solubilization buffer _PROTEIN_ . proteins were separated on acrylamide tricine gels . gels were stained using _METHOD_ brilliant blue r or silver nitrate . stained protein spots were excised from the gel washed reduced alkylated using iodoacetamide and digested with modified trypsin according to ref . citation . the peptides were then extracted and dissolved in of formic acid and applied to the maldi tof target plate by the dried droplet method using cyano hydrocynnamic acid as _PROTEIN_ . when necessary the samples were concentrated using microcolumns and eluted directly onto the maldi target . the _METHOD_ spectra were obtained using a maldi tof _METHOD_ spectrometer _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . the spectra were annotated with the program m/z from proteometrics and internally calibrated using tryptic peptides from autodigestion . the _PROTEIN_ versions of the ncbi nonredundant data base were searched with the resulting peptide _METHOD_ lists using the search engine profound . the search strategy was in principle as described previously . to further analyze the samples the remainder of the extracted peptides were desalted and concentrated on microcolumns _METHOD_ and eluted directly into nanoelectrospray needles with of meoh and formic acid . the spectra were acquired on an electrospray tandem _METHOD_ spectrometer _METHOD_ . the instrument was calibrated with nai in isopropanol . alternatively the spectra were used to search the public data bases with the program mascot . alternatively the _METHOD_ spectra were interpreted using _METHOD_ and pepseq _METHOD_ and were used to search different public data bases using . predictions for chloroplast localization chloroplast and lumenal transit peptides were made using the search engines targetp and predotar . first the sequences were grouped into clades of those where homologous relationships could be established using the union find algorithm applied with and identity threshold . this type of approach has been employed in establishing clusters of genes or proteins in various data bases . for the tree building of all the arabidopsis clp genes two distinct clades were identified . in both clades sequences were identified using a cutoff but not a cutoff and were excluded from further phylogenetic study . for both clades multiple sequence alignments were constructed using clustalw . additional multi alignments were done using multalin . using these multiple sequence alignments in phylip phylogenetic trees were calculated using maximum likelihood parsimony and two distance based methods with bootstrap values to test the statistical robustness of the trees . relationships that were present in all of the tree methodologies supported by bootstrap values > by at least one methodology are depicted whereas more ambiguous relationships are presented as start clusters . a box is placed over the central start where homology can not be established based upon sequence alone . a second tree using clpp/r sequences from arabidopsis synechocystis and synechococcus was built using clustalw alignment and both neighbor joining and maximum likelihood trees which were alike .
