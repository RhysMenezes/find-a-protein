_PROTEIN_ ribosome biogenesis is an essential process initiated in the nucleolus . in eukaryotes multiple ribosome biogenesis _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ can be found in the nucleolus the _LOCATION_ and in the cytoplasm . they act in processing folding and modification of the pre ribosomal rnas incorporation of ribosomal proteins export of pre ribosomal particles to the cytoplasm and quality control _METHOD_ . ribosome biogenesis is best established for saccharomyces cerevisiae . plant ortholog assignment to yeast _PROTEIN_ revealed the absence of about of the yeast _PROTEIN_ in plants . in turn few plant specific proteins have been identified by biochemical experiments to act in plant ribosome biogenesis . nevertheless a complete inventory of plant _PROTEIN_ has not been established yet . we analyzed the proteome of the _LOCATION_ and nucleolus of arabidopsis thaliana and the post translational modifications of these proteins . we identified proteins in the nucleolar and proteins in the _LOCATION_ fraction with an overlap of proteins . for a randomly selected set of proteins identified by the proteomic approach we confirmed the localization inferred from the proteomics data by the localization of _METHOD_ fusion proteins . we assigned the identified proteins to various complexes and functions and found about plant proteins that have a potential to act as a _PROTEIN_ but which have not been experimentally characterized yet . last we compared the distribution of _PROTEIN_ and rps in the various fractions with the distribution established for yeast .
we established a protocol for nucleolus isolation from cell culture as a prerequisite to analyze the proteome of the according fractions . we separated the cell lysate in cytoplasm and _LOCATION_ .

seventy of these plant specific proteins were detected in the nucleolar fraction only . twenty five of these proteins are proposed to be involved in transcription chromatin remodelling and histone activity or at least in dna or rna binding supported in part by experimental evidence . in addition for of the nucleolar plant specific proteins a function could not be proposed . seventeen of the plant specific nucleolar proteins are assigned as metabolic enzymes signal transduction modules or proteases and are assigned as proteins of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ or other organelles which is in agreement with the low contamination rate observed by immunodetection . in total plant specific proteins are found in both _LOCATION_ and nucleolus . of these proteins are of unknown function while of them are globally categorized as rna/dna binding or modifying . plant specific proteins of these compartments are classified as enzymes or signal transduction or protein degradation modules but for the majority this assignment is not yet supported by experimental evidence . in addition of the plant specific proteins identified are assigned as proteins of the _LOCATION_ or are involved in definition of cellular structures as _LOCATION_ or vesicular transport proteins or as proteins of other organelles . however of c c proteins are related to microtubule function and in _LOCATION_ structure definition while among the _LOCATION_ proteins nucleoporins are found . worth mentioning most of the proteins of other organelles are _LOCATION_ proteins of chloroplasts . analyzing the plant specific proteins found in all fractions shows that the majority of the proteins is assigned as enzymes or unknown whereas are dna and rna binding and processing proteins . as expected in the pool of plant specific proteins identified in all fractions we observed a drastically larger portion of proteins from other organelles in comparison to the other analyzed proteome sub pools . in total we identified plant specific proteins of unknown function in the nucleolus irrespective whether the protein was found in another fraction as well . moreover plant specific proteins in the nucleolus are proposed to function in rna/dna binding or processing in signal transduction and plant specific proteins in the nucleolus are classified as enzymes . none of these proteins has yet been characterized . by _METHOD_ _METHOD_ we identified plant specific proteins . we analyzed the subcellular localization of a randomly selected set of these proteins to confirm the identified localization and to justify the prediction of putative _PROTEIN_ based on their nucleolar identification . we cloned the cds of selected proteins in a reporter for _PROTEIN_ with n terminal or c terminal _METHOD_ fusion and analysis in a. thaliana protoplasts . we confirmed that fused to mcherry can be used to monitor nucleolar localization . in addition based on the _PROTEIN_ detected in the nucleolus by proteomics and _PROTEIN_ found in all fractions we demonstrate that n or c terminal _METHOD_ fusion yielded a comparable result and that the protein distribution as judged from the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ is consistent with the proteomic analysis . in total we analyzed proteins . for additional proteins we observed the same distribution by _METHOD_ microscopy as by _METHOD_ _METHOD_ namely for _PROTEIN_ a nucleolar localization for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ a _LOCATION_ localization for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ a _LOCATION_ localization and for _PROTEIN_ in the _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ . note while _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ we observed a small portion of _METHOD_ only which most likely accounts for the weak _LOCATION_ signal observed . for two proteins detected in all fractions by proteomic means we realized a less complex distribution . _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ yields _METHOD_ _METHOD_ in the _LOCATION_ and nucleolus only while _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ yields _METHOD_ _METHOD_ in the _LOCATION_ and in the _LOCATION_ but not in the nucleolus . for three proteins we observed _METHOD_ signal in all fractions while the proteins were not found in all fractions by proteomic means _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . finally for proteins we found different localizations while _PROTEIN_ was found in the _LOCATION_ and nucleolus by proteomic means we realized a _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ signal . however we noticed a significant portion of _METHOD_ in this case which might account for the _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ signal . for _PROTEIN_ we realized a _LOCATION_ / nucleolar distribution by _METHOD_ _METHOD_ analysis while the protein was only detected in the _LOCATION_ fraction . thus for more than of all analyzed proteins we observed the exact same result by proteome analysis of the fractions and by analysis of the protein distribution in cells by _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ fusion proteins . for about we realized an overlap of the different approaches because for about the existence in all fractions was not confirmed while for we found the protein in all fractions by analysis of the distribution of the _METHOD_ fusion protein . only for about we observed a distinct result between _METHOD_ _METHOD_ analysis and proteome determination after fractionation . considering that _METHOD_ _METHOD_ analysis can also be _LOCATION_ prone we conclude that by large the localization determined by _METHOD_ analysis is confirmed .
