the anaphase promoting complex or cyclosome is the ubiquitin ligase that targets destruction box containing proteins for proteolysis during the cell cycle . anaphase promoting complex or cyclosome and its activator proteins work together with ubiquitin conjugating enzymes . one class of _METHOD_ specifically involved in cyclin _PROTEIN_ degradation . although it has recently been shown that mammalian c is regulated at the protein level during the cell cycle not much is known concerning the _PROTEIN_ of these genes . arabidopsis encodes two genes belonging to the c gene family _PROTEIN_ . we found that _PROTEIN_ is able to complement fission yeast mutant indicating that the plant protein can functionally replace its yeast ortholog for protein degradation during mitosis . in situ hybridization experiments were performed to study the _PROTEIN_ of the c genes in various tissues of plants . their transcripts were always but not exclusively found in tissues active for cell division . thus the _PROTEIN_ may have a key function during cell cycle but may also be involved in ubiquitylation reactions occurring during differentiation and/or in differentiated cells . finally we showed that a translational fusion protein between _PROTEIN_ and green _METHOD_ protein localized both in the _LOCATION_ and the _LOCATION_ in stable transformed tobacco cells .
the sequences of the clam c andxenopus sp . ubc x were used for arabidopsis database searches and led to the identification of two different genes called _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ located on arabidopsis chromosome and chromosome respectively . both genes are _PROTEIN_ because their corresponding _PROTEIN_ sequence tags can be found in the currently available databases . the sequence of the longest _PROTEIN_ sequence tag was determined and it encodes an amino acids open reading frame which is complete at its n terminal end as indicated by an in frame stop codon upstream of the initiation codon . the protein sequence of _PROTEIN_ exhibits greater than sequence identity to _PROTEIN_ . a phylogenetic tree including all of the from arabidopsis indicated that _PROTEIN_ are more closely related to the than any other arabidopsis . bootstrap values derived from the neighbor joining method were all above inside of each clade further supporting the evolutionary relationship between the different subfamilies . both arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ amino acid sequences were aligned with human mouse goldfish xenopus sp. clam and fission yeast c orthologs and also brewer 's yeast _PROTEIN_ . the arabidopsis sequences contain the short n terminal extension that distinguishes this subgroup from other with the exception of yeast _PROTEIN_ . the plant proteins carry even the longest n terminal extensions _PROTEIN_ . the crystal structure of clam c has recently been solved . the authors showed that most of the residues that are specifically conserved into this class of enzymes contribute rather to the protein surface suggesting that they are at the molecular interface for protein interaction and specificity . most of these residues are conserved in the plant protein sequences _PROTEIN_ . in the active site cys _METHOD_ a thiol ester linkage with the c terminal _PROTEIN_ of ubiquitin . the coding region of arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ cdna was cloned in the inducible _PROTEIN_ vector and the enzyme was overexpressed in escherichia coli . a mutant version of the protein in which the catalytic cys was replaced by a ser residue was also produced in e coli . bacterial protein extracts _PROTEIN_ either the wild type or the mutant protein were assayed in vitro for ester formation of the recombinant polypeptides with radiolabeled ubiquitin in the presence of arabidopsis ubiquitin activating enzyme _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . as a control we used purified arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ protein . in the presence of the bacterial extracts a radiolabeled protein complex with a size of around kd could be detected . as expected the complexes formed between the native _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and ubiquitin were sensitive to boiling under reducing conditions indicating that the proteins are linked via a thiol ester bond . the protein complex with the mutant protein _PROTEIN_ was resistant to boiling in the presence of dtt most likely because of the formation of an oxygen ester . finally a mutant version of the protein in which the catalytic cys was replaced by an ala residue _PROTEIN_ was unable to form a complex with ubiquitin . disruption of the fission yeast gene produces both a _PROTEIN_ and a metaphase/anaphase cell cycle arrest . we tested whether the plant protein is able to rescue the fission yeast ts . for the complementation experiments different constructs were designed the full length _PROTEIN_ a dominant negative version of _PROTEIN_ and a chimeric gene in which the n terminal extension domain of _PROTEIN_ was replaced by the n terminal extension domain of yeast . the different constructs were put under the control of the thiamine repressible promoter of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ vector and transformed into . at nonpermissive temperature and in the absence of thiamine both the plant and the chimeric allowed the growth mutant whereas another arabidopsis belonging to a different subfamily was unable to complement the mutant strain . interestingly the chimeric protein was more efficient for the growth rescue of the yeast mutant strain than the wild type plant suggesting that the n terminal extension may carry important structural information involved in the function . as expected _PROTEIN_ worked as a dominant negative mutant protein because it inhibited the growth of mutant strain already at permissive temperature . if this strain was grown at permissive temperature but in the presence of thiamine which represses _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ no growth defect was detected . to investigate the _PROTEIN_ patterns of both genes by rna gel and in situ hybridization we tested first the specificity and cross reactivity of the cdna probes . genomic dna from arabidopsis and the closely related radish _PROTEIN_ plant was digested by different restriction enzymes and hybridized with both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ full length cdna probes . in both arabidopsis and radish only weak cross reactivity of the probes was detected . furthermore the _PROTEIN_ cdna probes did not cross react with other genes like those belonging to the _PROTEIN_ gene family . both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mrnas were found to accumulate in various arabidopsis organs and in germinating seeds . _PROTEIN_ of both genes was similar but not identical . both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mrnas accumulate in floral buds open flowers _METHOD_ and roots and at low levels in siliques . nevertheless _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ at higher level in mature leaves than _PROTEIN_ . we also gene _PROTEIN_ under different growth conditions including heat shock dark to light transition and drug treatments inducing a stress response none of these experimental conditions changed its _PROTEIN_ level . to study the gene _PROTEIN_ during re initiation of mitotic activity in arabidopsis we used an experimental system in which differentiated leaf cells are stimulated to re enter the cell cycle by wounding and auxin stimulation . and _PROTEIN_ mrnas accumulate in the leaf strips culture at the highest levels at to h a time when the first cell divisions are observed . histone mrnas accumulate at the highest level earlier at to h when most of the cells in the culture are in s phase . we also followed _PROTEIN_ mrna and protein levels during arabidopsis cell suspension culture . cells rapidly entered the logarithmic growth phase and reached the stationary stage after d. both histone and _PROTEIN_ mrnas reached their highest level of accumulation from d to . a polyclonal antibody was raised in rabbits against the amino acid n terminal peptide of _PROTEIN_ and used in western blot analysis . the _PROTEIN_ protein was only detectable during the first days of culture corresponding to the highest level of its transcript accumulation . as a control we used an antibody raised against _PROTEIN_ whose gene is constitutively _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis cell suspension culture . to analyze more precisely and identify the tissues in which the plant are _PROTEIN_ we performed in situ hybridization using utp labeled _PROTEIN_ anti sense or sense probes on different sections of arabidopsis and of its very closely related radish species . radish organs are larger than arabidopsis and were therefore used to obtain more accurate and detailed mrna localization . in general both _PROTEIN_ probes revealed almost identical _PROTEIN_ patterns except in root tissues . thus in situ hybridization with the _PROTEIN_ probe is only shown when different . _PROTEIN_ genes are _PROTEIN_ in the shoot apical meristem leaf primordial and young leaves . sense probes never allowed detection of a signal either with arabidopsis or radish sections as illustrated with the _PROTEIN_ sense probe . in _METHOD_ transcript localization of both is seen in the vascular tissue _PROTEIN_ . according to the rna gel analysis _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ at higher levels in mature leaves than _PROTEIN_ genes are also _PROTEIN_ in the root meristem and in emerging _PROTEIN_ roots . hybridization performed with sense probes gave only weak background signals as illustrated in figure . however whereas _PROTEIN_ is only _PROTEIN_ in the vascular cylinder _PROTEIN_ in protoxylem elements _PROTEIN_ probe allowed also the detection of a signal in differentiated root cortex xylem and phloem tissues . furthermore both genes were _PROTEIN_ in pericycle cells in maturing roots at the xylem poles where potentially _PROTEIN_ roots emerge . because the two probes exhibit weak cross hybridization and because the number of radish genes belonging to this family is unknown we can not exclude that this _PROTEIN_ pattern results from the superposition of the _PROTEIN_ of several still yet unknown homologs . to determine to what extent this gene family is subjected to differential tissue specific _PROTEIN_ additional experiments are required . differential tissue specific _PROTEIN_ has already been reported for the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ gene family using promoter _PROTEIN_ fusion studies . thus the in situ hybridization experiments revealed that in all tissues with cell division activities _PROTEIN_ could be detected like the shoot and root _METHOD_ expanding vascular tissues and leaf primordial . however the _PROTEIN_ of these genes is not exclusively correlated with cell proliferation because we found also _PROTEIN_ in differentiated cells . for subcellular localization studies _PROTEIN_ was translationally fused to the _METHOD_ proteins and stable transgenic tobacco cells _PROTEIN_ the fusion protein under the control of the dex inducible promoter were established . the _METHOD_ fusion protein like _METHOD_ alone was found both in the cytoplasm and the _LOCATION_ . the size of the fusion protein is around kd which is close to the selective barrier of passive protein diffusion . to investigate whether _PROTEIN_ carries the capacity to translocate a reporter protein in the _LOCATION_ we engineered a construct in which _PROTEIN_ was fused in frame to both _METHOD_ and gus increasing the size of the reporter protein to more than kd . nevertheless this was not the case and the _METHOD_ fusion protein like the _METHOD_ control protein localized _PROTEIN_ to the cytoplasm indicating that _PROTEIN_ enters the _LOCATION_ only by passive diffusion .
