the specification of the hair and non hair cells in the arabidopsis root epidermis provides a useful model for the study of cell fate determination in plants . a network of putative transcriptional regulators including the related bhlh proteins _PROTEIN_ and enhancer of _PROTEIN_ is known to influence the patterning of these cell types . here we analyze the _PROTEIN_ and regulation of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ during root epidermis development . although they are thought to act in both the hair and non hair cell types we surprisingly found that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ gene _PROTEIN_ and rna accumulation occurs preferentially in the developing hair cells . by analyzing the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ gus and _PROTEIN_ gus reporter fusions in various mutant and overexpression lines we discovered that the _PROTEIN_ of both genes is negatively regulated by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in the developing non hair cells and positively regulated by the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ proteins in the developing hair cells . further the analysis of a _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ translational fusion _PROTEIN_ under the _PROTEIN_ promoter indicates that the _PROTEIN_ protein moves from the hair cells to the non hair cells . these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ accumulation in the n cells is dependent on specification of the hair cell fate which itself is known to be influenced _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ by the non hair cells . this bi directional signaling mechanism defines a new regulatory circuit of intercellular communication to specify the epidermal cell types .
our earlier results led to the suggestion that the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ genes are _PROTEIN_ in both the developing hair cells and non hair cells . to test this we generated and analyzed promoter gus fusions for each gene _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . in each line the maximum gus activity was observed in the meristematic region of the developing root tip . this temporal pattern is similar to that previously reported for _PROTEIN_ and earlier than for _PROTEIN_ which is consistent with the view that the bhlh genes act at the same stage as _PROTEIN_ and regulate _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . however the _PROTEIN_ gus and _PROTEIN_ gus showed significantly higher levels of gus activity in cells located in the h position than the n position although longer incubation times also caused some gus staining in the n cells . the cells preferentially _PROTEIN_ these reporters were determined to be in the h position because the stained cell files overlie radial cortical cell walls they show a higher cell division rate than unstained files and they can be traced to mature cells that are hair forming . thus despite the important role of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in specifying the non hair fate in the n position these genes are preferentially _PROTEIN_ in the h cell position . to determine whether the unexpected bhlh promoter activity pattern was associated with a similar bhlh rna accumulation pattern we conducted in situ rna hybridization experiments . because of the high degree of sequence similarity throughout the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ genes it was not possible to generate viable gene specific antisense rna probes . rather we designed an antisense rna probe corresponding to a conserved region in _PROTEIN_ so that the probe would recognize both genes but not other related bhlh genes in arabidopsis . using whole roots from four day old wild type seedlings we found that this probe preferentially hybridized to cells in the h position . again the position of the cell files was determined by their location relative to the underlying cortical cell walls and their differential cell division rate . this result was reinforced by the analysis of bhlh rna accumulation in rare epidermal clones . these clones form when occasional longitudinal anticlinal divisions in cells in the h position create two cell files one located over the anticlinal cortical cell wall and one overlying a periclinal cortical cell wall . in these clones we found that cells in the n position no longer accumulate _PROTEIN_ rna . as a control roots hybridized with the sense rna strand as a probe yielded no signal . to confirm that the antisense rna probe indeed recognizes both gene sequences and to determine whether both rnas accumulate in the same pattern we also tested roots from the and _PROTEIN_ single mutants and the _PROTEIN_ double mutant . both single mutants showed a similar but weaker hybridization pattern as the wild type roots while _PROTEIN_ double mutant roots displayed a very low level of signal . this suggests that the antisense probe primarily detects _PROTEIN_ transcripts in the _PROTEIN_ mutant and _PROTEIN_ transcripts in the mutant . this conclusion is supported by gene specific rt pcr experiments that show a reduced level of _PROTEIN_ rna in the roots of and _PROTEIN_ relative to _PROTEIN_ and a reduced level of _PROTEIN_ rna in the roots of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ relative to . together these data imply that the _PROTEIN_ rna and _PROTEIN_ rna exhibit the same pattern of preferential accumulation in the h cell . these results support the reporter fusion results and suggest that the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ rnas do not move from cell to cell . the position dependent patterning of root epidermal gene _PROTEIN_ is known to be established during early stages of embryogenesis . to explore further the unexpected _PROTEIN_ pattern of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ we examined the _PROTEIN_ gus and _PROTEIN_ gus activity during embryogenesis . we found that gus activity accumulated in the same h cell pattern in the epidermis of the mature embryonic root as in the postembryonic root . considering this embryonic _PROTEIN_ we wished to determine whether the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ genes act in a similar manner in the embryonic and postembryonic root . specifically we examined whether embryonic _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ gene _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is reduced in a _PROTEIN_ mutant as they are in the seedling root . indeed we observed significantly less gus activity in the root of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ gus mature embryos . we were unable to detect any gus _PROTEIN_ in the mutant or wild type embryonic root bearing the _PROTEIN_ gus reporter which prevented an assessment of the role of _PROTEIN_ on _PROTEIN_ . the hypocotyl is known to be patterned by a similar network of transcription _PROTEIN_ as the root to define two position dependent cell types cells capable of producing stomata and non stomata cells . in _PROTEIN_ embryos bearing either the _PROTEIN_ gus or the _PROTEIN_ gus reporters we detected a significantly reduced level of gus activity in the embryonic hypocotyl relative to the wild type . this dependence of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ on the presence of _PROTEIN_ in the embryonic hypocotyl suggested a possible role for both proteins during stomatal patterning in the hypocotyl . to explore this further we analyzed stomata distribution in the hypocotyls of nine day old seedlings of wild type and _PROTEIN_ double mutants . in contrast to the wild type which has stomata predominantly form over a radial cortical cell wall the _PROTEIN_ hypocotyls have an increased number of stomata and they are present in both positions . this shows that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are required for proper stomata patterning and it strengthens the close relationship between the mechanism for patterning the hypocotyl and root epidermis in arabidopsis . effect of and _PROTEIN_ on stomata patterning in the hypocotyl we wished to determine whether any of the transcription _PROTEIN_ in the epidermal cell fate network might regulate the _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ genes . because the _PROTEIN_ gus line exhibited a greater _PROTEIN_ level than the _PROTEIN_ gus line thus allowing for better analysis of weaker effects we first focused our efforts on studying the control of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ pattern . we first examined the possible role of the upstream regulators in this system _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ gus transgene was introduced into the wer and ttg mutant backgrounds and we found that each of the homozygous mutants exhibit ectopic gus _PROTEIN_ in the n cell position . this suggests that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ negatively regulate _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in the n cells . next we tested the possible effects of the _PROTEIN_ inhibitors _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . we found that neither cpc nor try mutants significantly altered _PROTEIN_ gus _PROTEIN_ but the cpc try double mutant exhibited essentially no gus activity . we also introduced the _PROTEIN_ gus reporter construct in both the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ background and found that overexpression of each gene induced ectopic _PROTEIN_ gus _PROTEIN_ in the n cell position . as _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are related genes known to act in a partially redundant fashion this indicates that the _PROTEIN_ function is required for _PROTEIN_ gene _PROTEIN_ in the h position . we next tested the effect of and _PROTEIN_ mutants on _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . results from mutant and overexpression analyses indicate that _PROTEIN_ act at an early stage of root epidermis development so we expected no effect of mutations in the _PROTEIN_ acting genes _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . consistent with this the _PROTEIN_ gus pattern in and _PROTEIN_ was indistinguishable from the wild type . last we examined the possibility that the _PROTEIN_ proteins _METHOD_ might regulate _PROTEIN_ promoter activity . although roots of the _PROTEIN_ gus and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ gus lines exhibit only weak ectopic gus activity the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ gus double mutant line possessed strong gus _PROTEIN_ in the n position . furthermore overexpression of either bhlh gene _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ caused a weak or modest reduction in _PROTEIN_ gus _PROTEIN_ . these results suggest an autoregulation of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ protein _PROTEIN_ is able to inhibit its own gene 's promoter activity . to determine whether the _PROTEIN_ promoter activity is regulated in a similar manner as _PROTEIN_ we introduced the _PROTEIN_ gus reporter into selected genetic backgrounds . we found that the wer mutant the _PROTEIN_ double mutant and the _PROTEIN_ overexpression construct caused ectopic _PROTEIN_ gus _PROTEIN_ whereas the cpc try double mutant exhibited a much lower level of _PROTEIN_ gus _PROTEIN_ . in addition _PROTEIN_ gus activity was not effected by the cpc single mutant or the mutation . these results are all consistent with the effects of these _PROTEIN_ on _PROTEIN_ gus and it suggests that both genes are regulated similarly . in addition to assessing the role of the cell fate transcription _PROTEIN_ on promoter activity we wished to examine their effects on _PROTEIN_ rna accumulation . using whole mount rna in situ hybridization we analyzed the hybridization of an antisense probe _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ to roots from the wer cpc try and _PROTEIN_ . we found relative to the wild type ectopic signal in the wer mutant and the _PROTEIN_ line and very low level of signal from the cpc try double mutant . these results provide support for the promoter reporter fusion studies above and show that _PROTEIN_ negatively regulates _PROTEIN_ rna accumulation in the n position and _PROTEIN_ positively regulates _PROTEIN_ rna accumulation in the h position . to determine the location of the _PROTEIN_ bhlh proteins during epidermis development we constructed a _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ translational fusion under the control of the _PROTEIN_ promoter _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . this construct was introduced into both and mutant plants . these transgenic plants showed normal root hair patterning and trichome formation indicating that the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion was functional . transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ this construct displayed _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ predominantly in the _LOCATION_ of developing epidermal cells in the n position . we also verified this cell location by tracing the cells in the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ files back to non hair cells in the mature portion of the root . this suggests that the _PROTEIN_ protein accumulates in the n cell although the _PROTEIN_ promoter activity and _PROTEIN_ rna accumulation is primarily in the h cell .
the isolation of the mutant alleles used in this study has been described and both in the ler background _PROTEIN_ in the ler genetic background wer in the columbia ecotype ttg in the ler genetic background cpc in the ws genetic background try in the ler genetic background in the ler genetic background _PROTEIN_ in the ws ecotype . the following transgenic lines have been described previously _PROTEIN_ gus and _PROTEIN_ gus _PROTEIN_ gus _PROTEIN_ gus _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . lines homozygous for multiple mutations and/or transgenes were constructed by crossing single mutant or transgenic plants examining the progeny for putative mutant phenotypes and confirming the desired genotype in subsequent generations by backcrossing to single mutants and/or pcr based tests . for seedling analysis arabidopsis seeds were surface sterilized and grown on agarose solidified nutrient medium in vertically oriented petri plates as previously described . the histochemical analysis of plants containing the gus reporter constructs was performed on at least four day old root tips for each strain essentially as described . root epidermal cells were deemed to be in the n position if they were located outside a periclinal cortical cell wall whereas cells in the h position were located outside a radial wall between adjacent cortical cells . the distribution of epidermal cell types in the hypocotyl was analyzed in nine day old seedlings for each strain by determining the number of stomata formed along the hypocotyl in two adjacent epidermal cell files one located over anticlinal cortical cell walls and one located over periclinal cortical cell walls . the whole mount in situ rna hybridization procedure has been described . the rna probe was designed to hybridize to both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ transcripts so it included bp and bp downstream from the start site of the _PROTEIN_ coding sequence corresponding to the most similar region of the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ proteins but excluding the bhlh signature region to eliminate the possibility of cross hybridization to other bhlh proteins . to construct the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ translational fusion was used to provide a _PROTEIN_ genomic dna fragment containing the entire _PROTEIN_ gene including kb upstream of the start codon and kb downstream of the stop codon . the existing saci and sali sites of were destroyed and new saci and sali sites were generated by inverse pcr at the end of the _PROTEIN_ coding region . the _METHOD_ coding region was amplified from _METHOD_ and fused in frame to the _PROTEIN_ end . a bamhi fragment from this vector containing the entire _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion was subcloned into the bglii site of the t dna vector _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein is predicted to be kda whereas the predicted size of the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ proteins is kda and kda respectively . plant transformation was performed by the floral dip method .
