the composition of the mitochondrial outer _LOCATION_ is notoriously difficult to deduce by orthology to other _METHOD_ and biochemical enrichments are inevitably contaminated with the closely associated inner mitochondrial _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . in order to identify novel proteins of the outer mitochondrial _LOCATION_ in arabidopsis we integrated a quantitative _METHOD_ _METHOD_ analysis of highly enriched and prefractionated samples with a number of confirmatory biochemical and cell biology approaches . this approach identified proteins of which were novel more than doubling the number of confirmed outer _LOCATION_ proteins in plant mitochondria and suggesting novel functions for the plant outer mitochondrial _LOCATION_ . the novel components identified included proteins that affected mitochondrial morphology and/or segregation a protein that suggests the presence of bacterial type lipid a in the outer _LOCATION_ highly stress inducible proteins as well as proteins necessary for embryo development and several of unknown function . additionally proteins previously inferred via orthology to be present in other compartments such as an nadh cytochrome reductase required for hydroxyl fatty acid accumulation in developing seeds were shown to be located in the outer _LOCATION_ . these results also revealed novel proteins which may have evolved to fulfill plant specific requirements of the mitochondrial outer _LOCATION_ and provide a basis for the future functional characterization of these proteins in the context of mitochondrial intracellular interaction .
in order to identify protein components of the mitochondrial outer _LOCATION_ we developed a workflow that used multiple lines of independent evidence to discover and confirm the subcellular localization of proteins on the mitochondrial outer _LOCATION_ . the first aspect of this workflow was the selection of multiple independent prefractionated samples for comparisons with enriched mitochondrial outer _LOCATION_ in order to independently analyze the likely causes of contaminants . furthermore we sought a control for the protein composition of other mitochondrial _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ a control for the coenrichment of contaminating proteineous structures in the outer _LOCATION_ isolation process _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ and a control for nonmembrane proteins associating with the outer _LOCATION_ during the cell fraction procedures . by comparing the abundance of the proteins present in each of these fractions we were able in effect to subtract contaminants from the mitochondrial outer _LOCATION_ fraction in a statistically rigorous fashion . it should be noted that the success or failure of this technique hinges not on the purity of the fractions analyzed but on the relative enrichment of sources of contamination in the prefractionated samples to levels greater than that observed in the mitochondrial outer _LOCATION_ fraction . the result of these analyses was termed the putative outer mitochondrial _LOCATION_ proteome . the putative subcellular/submitochondrial location for each of these proteins was then assessed by techniques independent of the fractionation procedure including _METHOD_ tagging or in vitro mitochondrial protein import experiments . to rigorously define the outer mitochondrial _LOCATION_ proteome candidate proteins needed two independent pieces of evidence such as enrichment in the outer _LOCATION_ fraction as determined by _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and confirmation by another independent approach such as in vitro or in vivo targeting ability to the outer _LOCATION_ or western blot analysis . the application of these criteria led to the identification of a stringent set of proteins . to enrich mitochondria from which outer _LOCATION_ could be isolated a two stage separation of the organelle fraction of arabidopsis protoplasts was carried out . this involved first obtaining a crude organelle fraction _PROTEIN_ and then enriching mitochondria from this fraction initially by density gradient centrifugation and subsequently by free flow electrophoresis . the ability of ffe fractionation to separate mitochondria from other cellular contaminants even those in close association with the mitochondria _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ on a basis independent of organelle density allows mitochondria to be enriched to a greater degree than single physical property isolation strategies . the mitochondrial enrichment of each of these fractions was assessed by comparison of _METHOD_ blue staining profiles and immunodetection of proteins found in mitochondria _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ and the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . _METHOD_ blue staining of proteins separated by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ indicated that both the gradient fractionated and ffe fractionated samples were enriched in mitochondria compared with the starting material the _PROTEIN_ . image based quantitation of band intensity following immunodetection confirmed this enrichment as indicated by the presence of the outer _LOCATION_ marker _PROTEIN_ which was fold higher following gradient fractionation and fold higher after ffe . levels of _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ were assessed with an antibody raised to recombinant human calreticulin _LOCATION_ . these images indicated that _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ levels were reduced fold by gradient fractionation and more than fold by the ffe process . two major bands were detected in the _PROTEIN_ fraction corresponding to the two calnexin _METHOD_ _GENE_ and _GENE_ . peroxisomal contamination as indicated by the presence of _PROTEIN_ was reduced by fold after gradient fractionation and fold following ffe enrichment . similarly antibodies raised to the rubisco large subunit showed a fold reduction in chloroplast contamination after gradient purification and a fold reduction following ffe . an additional _LOCATION_ bound _LOCATION_ marker lhcb was readily detectable in enriched _LOCATION_ samples and present in the _PROTEIN_ fraction but was undetectable in either of the mitochondria enriched fractions . this high level of enrichment laid a firm foundation for the subsequent identification of extramitochondrial contaminants present in outer _LOCATION_ fractions . mitochondria were then subfractionated in order to separate the inner and outer _LOCATION_ . this process is perhaps the most problematic step in the enrichment of mitochondrial outer _LOCATION_ as the inner and outer _LOCATION_ are physically linked by proteins such as _PROTEIN_ . in order to separate them mitochondria were placed in hypoosmotic solution swelling the highly folded inner _LOCATION_ to beyond the capacity of the unfolded outer _LOCATION_ . this ruptures the outer _LOCATION_ which is then dissociated from the inner _LOCATION_ by several gentle strokes with a potter elvehjem homogenizer . the protein rich dense inner _LOCATION_ are separated from the less dense outer _LOCATION_ by sedimentation and subsequent flotation through suc gradients . this _LOCATION_ fractionation was performed on two samples the first being ffe enriched mitochondria to yield enriched mitochondrial outer _LOCATION_ and the second being the crude organelle enrichment _PROTEIN_ to yield a contaminated outer _LOCATION_ fraction _PROTEIN_ . additional prefractionated samples consisting predominantly of mitochondrial inner _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ and mitochondrial inner _LOCATION_ and _PROTEIN_ were prepared to allow the identification of contaminants arising from these compartments . the composition of these samples was examined by immunodetection of proteins characteristic of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and the mitochondrial inner _LOCATION_ . _METHOD_ brilliant blue staining of the separated fractions revealed differing protein profiles for each of the fractionated samples . identification of several high abundance bands on this gel by electrospray ionization tandem _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ showed that the most abundant band in the mitochondrial outer _LOCATION_ fraction consists of the previously identified mitochondrial outer _LOCATION_ proteins voltage dependent anion _PROTEIN_ and . identification of another high abundance band present in the prefractionated samples but absent from the outer _LOCATION_ fraction showed it to predominantly consist of a subunit of the subunit of _PROTEIN_ synthase which is located on the inner mitochondrial _LOCATION_ . details of these identifications can be found in supplemental table . immunodetection of the mitochondrial outer _LOCATION_ marker _PROTEIN_ in these same fractions revealed strong enrichment of the outer _LOCATION_ and corresponding depletion in the prefractionated samples . detection of _PROTEIN_ in the mitoplast and inner _LOCATION_ samples is a result of the incomplete separation of outer _LOCATION_ from inner _LOCATION_ during the homogenization process . conversely detection of the mitochondrial _PROTEIN_ marker pyruvate dehydrogenase subunit the mitochondrial inner _LOCATION_ marker cytochrome c oxidase subunit _PROTEIN_ the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ marker calnexin and the soluble _LOCATION_ marker _PROTEIN_ revealed depletion of each of these contaminants in the outer _LOCATION_ fraction and enrichment in at least one of the prefractionated samples . detection of _PROTEIN_ in the mitoplast sample is a result of residual peroxisomal contamination of the mitochondrial enrichment procedure and can also be observed in figure . owing to the enriched/unenriched sampling strategy used this residual contamination is accounted for by the inclusion of _PROTEIN_ om which is more enriched in _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ than mt om however _PROTEIN_ being a soluble protein is lost in the preparation of this _LOCATION_ sample . immunodetection of additional _LOCATION_ anchored proteins characteristic of the _LOCATION_ outer envelope _PROTEIN_ and peroxisomal _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ did not detect these proteins in any of the subfractionated samples . however the chloroplast _LOCATION_ proteins _PROTEIN_ and lhcb were detected in purified chloroplasts . the first quantitative approach undertaken involved the counting of spectra that matched individual proteins in the purified outer _LOCATION_ fraction . these counts were then compared with those observed in the prefractionated samples . the first of these comparisons was designed to eliminate _LOCATION_ associated contaminants arising from other organelles/membrane _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . the second of these comparisons was designed to identify contaminants in the mt om fraction that arose from other mitochondrial compartments _PROTEIN_ . these comparisons enabled a quantitative assessment of whether their constituent proteins were located on the outer mitochondrial _LOCATION_ or elsewhere in the cell allowing the assembly of a short list of likely outer _LOCATION_ proteins . each of the protein samples _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was acetone precipitated digested and analyzed by esi _METHOD_ . a total of unique arabidopsis proteins were identified across three biological replicates of this set of samples . a false discovery rate for this data set was empirically determined by compiling the _METHOD_ spectra from each of the esi _METHOD_ analyses and searching this file against a _PROTEIN_ database . these searches indicated a false discovery rate of at the peptide level . of the proteins were identified in the outer _LOCATION_ fraction in more than one biological replicate . by modeling the numbers of spectra observed for each protein using poisson regression we found a total of proteins that were enriched in the outer _LOCATION_ fractions using the following criteria must be detected in two or more biological replicates and have a p value of or less for enrichment over both the _PROTEIN_ om and mt _PROTEIN_ samples when the spectra from all biological replicates are pooled . this p value was intentionally less stringent at this preliminary stage in order to maximize the ability of these analyses to discover putative mitochondrial outer _LOCATION_ proteins given that any unintentionally included contaminants would be removed in the subsequent experimental confirmation steps . the validity of this analysis was also investigated by _METHOD_ targeting studies of several proteins falling on either side of this cutoff which indicated that loosening the p value further would increase the number of contaminants without including more outer _LOCATION_ proteins in the preliminary list . proteins that were only detected in the mt om samples provided that they were present in more than one biological replicate were also included on the basis that these were likely to be lower abundance mitochondrial outer _LOCATION_ proteins only detected following enrichment . this list of proteins did not contain abundant mitochondrial inner _LOCATION_ proteins such as the adp/atp carrier and was generally devoid of components of the mitochondrial respiratory chain . the proteins encompassed of the proteins that have previously been shown to be located in the outer mitochondrial _LOCATION_ in various studies in plants . despite the difficulties inherent in working with plant cells such as limited starting material lysis complications due to the cell wall and extra contamination arising from an additional organelle the percentage of proteins in this preliminary list compares favorably with previously published outer mitochondrial _LOCATION_ proteomes from nonplant species . we calculated coverage of known outer _LOCATION_ mitochondrial proteins in our preliminary data set versus in s. cerevisiae and in n. crassa . this coverage was achieved with a pool of just proteins versus in s. cerevisiae . the two proteins that were not included in this preliminary set were and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . additional lines of evidence were sought until each protein present in the member putative outer _LOCATION_ proteome had two independent lines of evidence to confirm this location or a single high quality line of evidence to dispute its inclusion in this list . a summary of this information can be found in tables i and ii and supplemental table . columns from left to right are as follows _PROTEIN_ no.

indicate that the ratio can not be calculated because a null value was obtained and thus the p value can not be calculated as shown by . components of the tom complex have been isolated previously from mitochondrial outer _LOCATION_ preparations and identified by a variety of methods contributing literature evidence for the tom components tom and . other members of the mitochondrial protein import apparatus metaxin and _PROTEIN_ have previously been shown to be located in the outer mitochondrial _LOCATION_ by _METHOD_ studies . several members of the vdac family _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ have also been shown to be located in the mitochondrial outer _LOCATION_ by _METHOD_ studies . a number of proteins present in the putative outer mitochondrial _LOCATION_ proteome in this study have previously been reported to be in other subcellular locations . these proteins included _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ which have been previously reported to be soluble proteins of the mitochondrial intermembrane space . a variety of other proteins in the set of are known to be proteins in the inner mitochondrial _LOCATION_ ubiquinone cytochrome c oxidoreductase like family protein is a subunit of complex iii _PROTEIN_ subunit has been shown to be a member of complex v and _PROTEIN_ unknown protein and unknown protein are subunits of complex i . isocitrate _PROTEIN_ has also been shown to be present in the inner _LOCATION_ fraction of mitochondria . initial inspection of the putative proteome indicated the presence of soluble contaminants arising from the mitochondrial _PROTEIN_ . and aspartate aminotransferase _PROTEIN_ are two high abundance _PROTEIN_ enzymes . we chose to address this source of contamination by conducting an additional quantitative proteomic study using isobaric tags . this study evaluated the abundance of proteins in four fractions the same three as used in the spectral counting analysis with the addition of a sample composed chiefly of mitoplasts _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . a ratio of at p < was selected as the cutoff on the basis that known outer _LOCATION_ proteins were included while known contaminants were excluded . the validity of this cutoff was confirmed by _METHOD_ localization of _LOCATION_ and aminobutyrate aminotransferase _LOCATION_ two proteins that fell close to but outside the cutoff and were shown to localize to the mitochondria but not to the outer _LOCATION_ . thus the itraq analysis using these criteria contributed evidence for the removal of four proteins from the list of namely _PROTEIN_ gaba aminotransferase and a putative nadh cytochrome reductase . these exclusions left a group of proteins for which additional evidence was sought in the form of _METHOD_ localization . to accurately use this method it was first established that _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ microscopy were capable of distinguishing mitochondrial inner _LOCATION_ or _PROTEIN_ proteins from those located on the outer mitochondrial _LOCATION_ . for these purposes an inner _LOCATION_ protein _PROTEIN_ a _PROTEIN_ protein and a previously characterized outer _LOCATION_ protein elongated _PROTEIN_ fused to _METHOD_ were transiently transformed into arabidopsis cell culture along with a mitochondrial _PROTEIN_ targeted red _METHOD_ protein control and observed using _METHOD_ microscopy . a clear difference was observed between the _METHOD_ patterns of the control proteins located in the inner _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and the outer _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ . the inner _LOCATION_ and _PROTEIN_ located controls showed filled green circular _METHOD_ patterns whereas the outer _LOCATION_ control _PROTEIN_ displayed green _PROTEIN_ patterns . this _PROTEIN_ pattern can also be observed for the unknown function _GENE_ which was in the set of and deemed to be a positive localization of the _METHOD_ fusion protein to the mitochondrial outer _LOCATION_ . this is also consistent with previous reports using _METHOD_ tagging of mitochondrial outer _LOCATION_ proteins . similar _PROTEIN_ structures corresponding to a mitochondrial outer _LOCATION_ location were observed for of the proteins tested . of these proteins only displayed this pattern surrounding the red _METHOD_ protein control indicating an exclusive mitochondrial outer _LOCATION_ localization while four of the tested proteins displayed _METHOD_ patterns consistent with localization to the mitochondrial outer _LOCATION_ but also localized to other intracellular structures which were apparently not mitochondrial in nature . _METHOD_ analysis of the remaining proteins showed that seven of these did not localize to the mitochondria two were seen to be mitochondrial but did not display the _PROTEIN_ structure characteristic of outer _LOCATION_ proteins and three proteins failed to display any _METHOD_ related _METHOD_ or were inconsistent from cell to cell . images of all of the above _METHOD_ patterns can be viewed in supplemental figures to . the two mitochondria localized proteins that did not display the _PROTEIN_ structure were selected for in vitro protein uptake experiments . both were seen to be protease protected when incubated with mitochondria under conditions that support protein uptake . when valinomycin was added to the in vitro uptake assay no protease protection was evident indicating the requirement of _LOCATION_ potential for import that is a feature of inner _LOCATION_ or _PROTEIN_ localization . of the three proteins for which a consistent _METHOD_ localization could not be confirmed two were deemed to be outer _LOCATION_ proteins on the basis that other _METHOD_ of the protein family had been investigated as part of this study and were found to be localized to the outer mitochondrial _LOCATION_ . these proteins were and _PROTEIN_ . the final protein the unknown protein was excluded as no additional evidence was found for its localization beyond the quantitative _METHOD_ data . the n and c terminal amino acids of this large protein were fused to _METHOD_ but failed to show a consistent subcellular localization . together the _METHOD_ literature searches and _METHOD_ analysis produced a final list of plant outer _LOCATION_ proteins of these being novel doubling the number of confirmed outer _LOCATION_ proteins in plant mitochondria and identifying all but two proteins that were previously known . in order to gain further localization confirmation for the three novel mitochondrial outer _LOCATION_ proteins deoxy manno octulosonate cytidylyltransferase _PROTEIN_ phosphorylethanolamine cytidylyltransferase _PROTEIN_ and the sorting and assembly machinery protein polyclonal antibodies were raised following bacterial _PROTEIN_ and purification of portions of these proteins . isolated mitochondria were treated with increasing amounts of proteinase k. this treatment degrades portions of mitochondrial proteins that were accessible to the protease and preserved proteins that were protected by the lipid bilayer of the mitochondrial outer _LOCATION_ . treated mitochondria were separated by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and a number of proteins were immunodetected . is a mitochondrial outer _LOCATION_ protein that is exposed to the _LOCATION_ . this protein is rapidly degraded at low concentrations of proteinase k. examination of _PROTEIN_ revealed a similar breakdown profile indicating that part of this protein is exposed to the _LOCATION_ in vivo and is likely to be located on the outer mitochondrial _LOCATION_ . _PROTEIN_ was also seen to be accessible to the proteinase . orthologs of arabidopsis have been observed to be localized to the outer mitochondrial _LOCATION_ in s. cerevisiae . like _PROTEIN_ is a transmembrane barrel protein descended from the bacterial ancestor protein and it appears that these two proteins are not readily accessible to the externally applied proteinase . at the two highest concentrations of proteinase both of these proteins were seen to be partially broken down whereas the rieske iron sulfur protein which is located on the inner mitochondrial _LOCATION_ was resistant to digestion . this indicates that in agreement with the other data presented here is likely to be located on the outer mitochondrial _LOCATION_ in arabidopsis and that mitochondrial integrity was not compromised by the proteinase treatment . an unexpected outcome of using full length coding sequences fused to _METHOD_ was the observation that several of the _METHOD_ fusion proteins apparently altered the mitochondrial morphology in transformed cells . in the case of _PROTEIN_ highly abnormal giant mitochondria occupied much of the available space in observed cells . this protein appears to be of bacterial origin is thought to be involved in the synthesis of the outer envelope lipopolysaccharide lipid a and has been located in mitochondria but not to the outer _LOCATION_ in previous studies in arabidopsis . _PROTEIN_ is the penultimate enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of phosphatidylethanolamine an important _LOCATION_ phospholipid . the overexpression of the outer _LOCATION_ targeted fusion protein apparently causes mitochondria to bunch together at one pole of the cell . overexpression of a mitochondrial outer _LOCATION_ nadh cytochrome reductase also appears to alter mitochondrial morphology when compared with the more typical mitochondrial outer _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ pattern seen with the unknown protein _GENE_ . in order to determine whether there was a relationship between colocalization and coexpression the relative _PROTEIN_ levels for the genes that were present on the affymetrix _PROTEIN_ microarray were analyzed during germination and across the arabidopsis developmental microarray series . additionally the patterns of transcript abundance for genes that encode inner _LOCATION_ proteins were analyzed to determine if the transcript abundance of genes that encode outer _LOCATION_ proteins or subsets of outer _LOCATION_ proteins differed from the patterns of transcript abundance for genes that encode inner _LOCATION_ proteins . data were normalized to make them comparable and _PROTEIN_ levels are displayed relative to maximum _PROTEIN_ . overall it was observed that the transcript abundance of genes encoding outer and inner _LOCATION_ mitochondrial proteins displayed maximum levels during seed germination with a subset showing relatively high levels in root tissues . when all genes encoding inner _LOCATION_ and outer _LOCATION_ localized proteins were clustered together over a germination time course it was seen that genes encoding outer _LOCATION_ proteins were significantly underrepresented in cluster compared with genes encoding inner _LOCATION_ proteins _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . gene in cluster displayed high transcript abundance in fresh harvested seeds that _PROTEIN_ during stratification . in contrast of genes encoding outer _LOCATION_ proteins _LOCATION_ were seen in the group of genes showing transient _PROTEIN_ during germination in cluster which represents a significant overrepresentation of genes encoding outer _LOCATION_ proteins in this cluster . genes in cluster peak in transcript abundance during the first h of germination and _PROTEIN_ in abundance in young seedlings as under these conditions germination is completed at h in arabidopsis as the radicle has emerged . thus although genes encoding mitochondrial outer _LOCATION_ proteins follow the general pattern observed for genes encoding inner _LOCATION_ proteins in that they display maximum levels of transcript abundance during seed germination detailed time course analysis reveals that for a large subset this differs from the majority of genes encoding mitochondrial proteins . previously it has been shown for maize and rice that active mitochondrial biogenesis precedes the _PROTEIN_ of respiratory chain components of the inner _LOCATION_ thus the pattern observed here suggests that the establishment of the proteins of the outer _LOCATION_ is one of the earliest steps to take place in mitochondrial biogenesis .
