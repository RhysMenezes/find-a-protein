the majority of mitochondrial proteins are encoded in the _LOCATION_ genome and imported into mitochondria posttranslationally from the _LOCATION_ . an n terminal presequence functions as the signal for the import of mitochondrial proteins . however the functional information in the presequence remains elusive . this study reports the identification of critical sequence motifs from the presequence of arabidopsis thaliana _PROTEIN_ subunit . was divided into six amino acid segments designated to from the n to the c terminus each of which was further divided into two amino acid subdivisions . these p segments and their subdivisions were substituted with ala residues and fused to green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ . protoplast targeting experiments using these _METHOD_ constructs revealed that contains several functional sequence motifs that are dispersed throughout the presequence . the sequence motifs dqeeg and vvrnr were involved in translocation across the mitochondrial _LOCATION_ . the sequence motifs iaarp and iaair participated in binding to mitochondria . the sequence motifs rllps and _PROTEIN_ assisted in pulling proteins into the _PROTEIN_ and the sequence motif iaarp functioned in dependent import . in addition these sequence motifs exhibit complex relationships including synergistic functions . thus multiple sequence motifs dispersed throughout the presequence are proposed to function cooperatively during protein import into mitochondria .
to characterize the molecular mechanism underlying protein import into mt in plant cells sequence motifs were identified in . contains the n terminal amino acids of arabidopsis thaliana with a putative processing site after the amino acid . when _METHOD_ a fusion construct between and green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ was transiently _PROTEIN_ in protoplasts from leaf tissues of arabidopsis a punctate staining pattern was observed that colocalized with the mitochondrial marker mitotracker red . in addition when a lysate of these cells was analyzed by immunoblotting using an anti _METHOD_ antibody two protein bands at and kd were detected . the kd band was the expected size of the processed form of _METHOD_ generated by cleavage at the processing site following its import into mt . indeed the size of the processed form was nearly identical to that of an n terminal deletion mutant _METHOD_ which lacks amino acids to . these results suggest that _METHOD_ was correctly targeted to mt in arabidopsis protoplasts . to identify sequence motifs that are critical for protein import into mt various ala substitution mutants were generated . serial c terminal deletion of revealed that the n terminal residues are sufficient to target _METHOD_ to the mitochondrial _PROTEIN_ . accordingly the n terminal residues of were divided into six amino acid segments designated to . each p segment was substituted with the corresponding number of ala residues with the exception of the initial met . previously a similar approach was used to identify sequence motifs in chloroplast transit peptides . the serial ala substitution mutants were fused to _METHOD_ and the resulting constructs were introduced into protoplasts . _METHOD_ localization was examined by _METHOD_ microscopy h after transformation . all the substitution mutant proteins produced the punctate and thread like patterns similar to the full length _METHOD_ . furthermore the _METHOD_ signals overlapped with that of mitotracker red confirming that they are targeted to the mt . as for _METHOD_ which had an ala substitution in the proteins were _PROTEIN_ at undetectable levels . thus this construct was excluded from analysis . to examine the import of the mutant and the full length _METHOD_ constructs at the biochemical level protein extracts were prepared from protoplasts at and hat and analyzed by immunoblotting using anti _METHOD_ antibody . the import efficiency of _METHOD_ was and at and hat respectively . the ala substitution mutants displayed various import efficiencies contrasting with their localization patterns . the import efficiency of _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ with an ala substitution in and respectively was similar to that of _METHOD_ at hat . however _METHOD_ exhibited a slight _PROTEIN_ in import efficiency at early time points . this raised the possibility that contains a sequence motif that functions in an early step of the import process . by contrast _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ which had ala substitutions in and respectively displayed import efficiencies of and at hat and and at hat respectively . these efficiencies were significantly lower than that of _METHOD_ indicating that and contain sequence motifs that are important for protein import into mt . from the immunoblot analysis we investigated whether the detected proteins are associated with but not imported into mt or are imported into mt but not processed . to confirm the localization of these reporter proteins protoplast lysates were separated into soluble and _LOCATION_ fractions by ultracentrifugation and analyzed by immunoblotting using an anti _METHOD_ antibody . the separation of soluble and _LOCATION_ proteins was confirmed by blotting with antibodies against arabidopsis aleurain like protein _PROTEIN_ and porin which localize to the _LOCATION_ lumen and mitochondrial _LOCATION_ respectively . following this fractionation imported _PROTEIN_ proteins should be detected in the soluble fraction . the processed _METHOD_ of the wild type _METHOD_ and ala substitution mutants _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ were detected in the soluble fraction . in addition the intermediate _METHOD_ of _METHOD_ were also detected in the soluble fraction . _METHOD_ alone used as a control for _METHOD_ fusion proteins was also detected in the soluble fraction . however the unprocessed precursors of these reporter proteins _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ were detected largely in the _LOCATION_ fraction with a minor proportion of _METHOD_ precursors in the soluble fraction indicating that these mutant precursors are defective in protein import into mt . to further confirm the localization of these proteins we examined the sensitivity of these proteins to thermolysin . the gentle protoplast lysates were treated with thermolysin in the presence and absence of triton x and analyzed by immunoblotting using anti _METHOD_ antibody . in these conditions _LOCATION_ proteins or _PROTEIN_ proteins exposed to the _LOCATION_ are sensitive to thermolysin . by contrast proteins within mt are protected from degradation by thermolysin but become sensitive to thermolysin in the presence of triton x . the tightly folded core domain of _METHOD_ is known to be resistant to proteolytic degradation by thermolysin . thus only the n terminally exposed regions are degraded by thermolysin and the product is a smaller protein species . the processed _METHOD_ of all the ala substitution mutants _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ were protected from thermolysin and became sensitive to thermolyin in the presence of triton x indicating that they are imported into mt . however the precursors of all these reporter constructs with exception of _METHOD_ were largely sensitive to thermolysin indicating that the precursors were associated with the surface of mt . in the case of _METHOD_ the thermolysin treatment also increased the amount of the degradation band at kd indicating that a proportion of the precursors were associated with the surface of mt . at the same time a proportion of the precursors was resistant to thermolysin but became sensitive to thermolysin in the presence of triton x raising the possibility that they are imported into mt but not processed into mature _METHOD_ or protected by a membranous structure . in and mutants the highly conserved arg residue and the processing site were replaced with ala residues respectively . the arg residue is thought to be critical for precursor processing . therefore it is possible that the observed reduction in import efficiency of these ps mutants in particular _METHOD_ was caused by defective processing of the imported precursors rather than by defects in the import process itself . in _PROTEIN_ the presence of _METHOD_ precursors that are resistant to thermolysin raised this possibility . to test this possibility we determined the exact location of the thermolysin resistant _METHOD_ precursors . transformed protoplasts were gently lysed and treated with thermolysin . after inactivation of thermolysin the lysates were further lysed by sonication and separated into the soluble and _LOCATION_ fractions by ultracentrifugation . in this experimental scheme precursors located in the cytoplasm should be degraded by thermolysin and the unprocessed precursors in mitochondrial _PROTEIN_ should be protected from thermolysin and detected in the soluble fraction after separation by ultracentrifugation . indeed the _PROTEIN_ protein idh was protected from thermolysin mediated degradation and detected in the soluble fraction . the thermolysin resistant _METHOD_ precursors were detected in the pellet fraction indicating that they are not fully imported into mt but rather associated with mitochondrial _LOCATION_ . this result supports the notion that the ala substitution at may not affect the processing . consistent with this notion _METHOD_ which had an identical ala substitution to at the processing site did not show any defect in protein import into mt in protoplasts . to further confirm this finding we performed in vitro import experiments using wild type and mutant ps constructs . for in vitro experiments the full length constructs with these ala substitution mutations in the ps were used instead of the _METHOD_ fusion constructs . and gave import efficiencies of and respectively indicating that ala substitution in and severely affected the import efficiency whereas ala substitution in and had only minor effect on import . thus the import efficiency of these mutants in vitro was different from their import efficiency in protoplasts . this difference may be caused by a difference in import conditions such as the amount of precursors and the time course we used in these experiments . however despite the difference in the import efficiency between the protoplast and in vitro system the processed _METHOD_ of all the ala substitution mutants were identical in size to the processed form of the wild type construct . in addition in the presence of valinomycin an inhibitor of protein import into mt none of these constructs produced proteinase k resistant mature proteins confirming that the processed _METHOD_ are generated by _PROTEIN_ after their import into mitochondrial _PROTEIN_ . moreover despite the ala substitution mutations of the and the processing site in and respectively they were correctly processed suggesting that and have a defect in crossing the envelope _LOCATION_ but not in processing . ala substitution mutations introduce new sequences and thereby may alter the secondary structure in the ps . this in turn may have unexpected effects on protein import into mt . thus we examined the secondary structure of the wild type and mutant pss using the prediction tool psi pred . according to the prediction contains helical structures in the and in the c terminal region from the to the end of the ps . has a coiled coil structure in the middle of the ps with the exception of a short helical region in the subdivision . the mutant did not show any secondary structural changes . however the coiled coil structure was replaced by a short helical structure in the and mutants . therefore we can not exclude the possibility that structural changes in the mutant pss affected protein import into mt . as an alternative approach deletion mutants were generated and their import efficiency into mt was evaluated . each p segment was deleted to generate or which was fused to _METHOD_ . the resulting constructs were introduced into protoplasts and the localization and import efficiency were determined by _METHOD_ microscopy and immunoblot analysis respectively . _METHOD_ produced a _LOCATION_ diffuse _METHOD_ pattern indicating that the protein was not targeted to mt . by contrast other deletion constructs _METHOD_ _METHOD_ did not display significant defects in protein targeting to mt . similar to the full length _METHOD_ these deletion mutants primarily produced punctate staining patterns indicating that they are targeted to mt . in addition the import efficiency of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ as determined by immunoblot analysis was similar to the corresponding ala substitution mutants . however the import efficiency of _METHOD_ was significantly different from that of _METHOD_ . moreover they showed different processing patterns . subcellular fractionation and thermolysin treatment assay confirmed that the two processed _METHOD_ of _METHOD_ near kd were located in the mitochondrial _PROTEIN_ . the segment contains which is critical for the processing by _PROTEIN_ . therefore it is possible that the deletion resulting in removal of the conserved and bringing a new sequence close to the processing site at the affects processing and import efficiency . therefore to avoid this complication and because ala substitution of the first amino acid segment but not the second amino acid segment of caused a significant defect in protein import into mt we generated an additional mutant that had a deletion of the first amino acid segment of and examined its import into mt . the import efficiency of _METHOD_ was similar to that of the ala substitution mutants _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ . taken together these results support the notion that the import defects observed in ala substitution in and segments are not directly correlated with any possible alteration of their secondary structure by ala substitution . to further define the critical sequence motifs in and these segments were further divided into two subdivisions containing five residues . each of these subdivisions was then substituted with five ala residues . the mutants were fused to _METHOD_ and the resulting constructs were introduced into protoplasts to examine the import efficiency . _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ containing ala substitutions at the first and second amino acid subdivision of respectively exhibited import efficiencies of and at hat respectively indicating that their import efficiency is higher than that of _METHOD_ but lower than that of wild type _METHOD_ . it is possible that the sequence motifs in and are functionally redundant and both motifs are required for full activity . alternatively it is possible that the sequence motifs in and may constitute a single motif and ala substitution in or renders the motif partially defective in protein import into mt . to define the sequence motif in the import efficiency of _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ was examined . these constructs contained ala substitutions in the first and second amino acid subdivision of respectively . the import efficiency of _METHOD_ was at hat similar to that of _METHOD_ . by contrast the import efficiency of _METHOD_ was similar to that of _METHOD_ . these results indicate that the dqeeg sequence in is critical for protein import into mt . in addition in the dqeeg motif all five amino acid residues were critical for import . this motif contains multiple acidic amino acids . this represents an unusual feature as the lack of acidic residues is a characteristic property of the ps . next the import efficiency of _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ containing ala substitutions at the first and second amino acid subdivisions of respectively was examined . _METHOD_ but not _METHOD_ exhibited a significant defect in mitochondrial protein import as was observed with _METHOD_ . similar to the dqeeg motif all five amino acid residues in the vvrnr motif were important for the import process suggesting that this is the combination of the amino acids that is important . _METHOD_ contained double mutations in dqeeg and vvrnr . in protoplasts _METHOD_ produced only kd precursors with a small amount of a degradation product at the kd position indicating that the protein import into mt was almost completely inhibited . thus these two motifs are most crucial for protein import into mt and upon mutation of these motifs the ps loses the ability to target to mt . the mitochondrial import process can be divided into multiple steps . these include the _LOCATION_ navigation to mt binding to mitochondrial tom receptors and translocation through outer and inner mitochondrial _LOCATION_ . to define the specific protein import steps affected in the ala substitution mutants protein extracts from protoplasts transformed with _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ were separated into soluble and _LOCATION_ fractions by ultracentrifugation and analyzed by immunoblotting using anti _METHOD_ antibody . the processed _METHOD_ of _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ were detected in the soluble fraction . by contrast the precursors of _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ were detected in the _LOCATION_ fraction indicating that they are associated with mt but not imported into the _PROTEIN_ . the results suggest that the dqeeg and vvrnr are involved in crossing the mitochondrial _LOCATION_ . to further define the specific steps affected by these motifs the thermolysin sensitivity of _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ was examined . the precursor of _METHOD_ was also largely sensitive to thermolysin . however the _METHOD_ precursors were _PROTEIN_ resistant but became sensitive to thermolysin in the presence of triton x . these data indicate that although both mutant precursors were associated with _LOCATION_ this association occurs at different stages . the processed _METHOD_ of both mutant proteins became sensitive to thermolysin upon treatment with triton x confirming that the processed proteins are located within mt . based on these results the dqeeg motif is involved in an earlier step than the vvrnr motif and both steps occur while the precursors are passing through the import channel . to assess how frequently the two critical motifs dqeeg and vvrnr are found in the pss of mitochondrial proteins we used an approach that has been previously used to compare the sequence motifs of transit peptides . a total of arabidopsis mitochondrial proteins that are located in the mt were identified using the uniprot database . the first amino acids of these proteins were used in a global alignment to identify motifs that were identical or similar to dqeeg or vvrnr . the n terminal residues were chosen because the dqeeg and vvrnr motifs of are located within this region . of the pss and pss were predicted to contain dqeeg like and vvrnr like motifs respectively . statistical significance of the global alignment scores was assessed by calculating p values . in both cases we used the p value of global alignment scores lower than and the predicted sequence motif that had the p value lower than was defined as a like motif . in addition six pss were predicted to contain both dqeeg like and vvrnr like motifs . the ps of nadh dehydrogenase iron sulfur protein b was predicted to contain dqeeg like and vvrnr like motifs at amino acids to and to respectively . to test whether the two motifs in play a role in mitochondrial import the motifs were replaced with ala residues and the resulting mutants were fused to _METHOD_ to create _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ . these mutants or the wild type construct _METHOD_ were transformed into protoplasts and their localization was examined . all constructs exhibited a punctate staining pattern indicating that they were targeted to mt . to determine the import efficiency of these mutants protein lysates from the protoplasts were analyzed by immunoblotting using an anti _METHOD_ antibody . the import efficiency of the wild type construct _METHOD_ was at hat . similarly the import efficiency of _METHOD_ was at hat indicating that substitution of the ddeea motif with ala residues had only marginal effect on the mitochondrial import of . although this result suggests that the ddeea motif is not important for mitochondrial protein import it can not be excluded that another sequence motif was able to compensate for the loss of the ddeea . by contrast the import efficiency of _METHOD_ was and an intermediate form was observed indicating that the substitution of the alrar with ala residues disrupted mitochondrial protein import . the ps of _PROTEIN_ synthase subunit was predicted to contain a vnrnpr motif between amino acids and similar to the vvrnr motif of . to examine the importance of the vnrnpr for mitochondrial import the motif was replaced with ala residues and the resulting mutant was fused to _METHOD_ to give _METHOD_ . this mutant or the wild type construct pfa _METHOD_ was transformed into protoplasts and their localization was examined . both proteins exhibited punctate _METHOD_ indicating they were targeted to mt . immunoblotting was used to examine the import efficiencies of these proteins . the wild type and mutant proteins showed and of the import efficiency respectively indicating that the vnrnpr motif plays an important role in protein translocation across the mitochondrial _LOCATION_ . together these results suggest that vvrnr like motifs present in pss of other mitochondrial proteins play an important role in mitochondrial protein import . since we found no evidence that dqeeg like motifs contribute to mitochondrial import of other proteins it is possible that this motif is unique to . the ps was further analyzed to investigate the presence of additional sequence motifs that had not been identified during the first round of ala substitution mutations . it was reasoned that functionally compensatory motifs might not be identified by ala substitution of a single motif . indeed pss are known to contain multiple binding sites . in addition functionally compensatory sequence motifs are present in the transit peptide of the ribulose bisphosphate _PROTEIN_ small subunit . thus a new set of ala substitution mutants was generated into two subdivisions in a combinatorial manner . these mutants were fused to _METHOD_ and the resulting constructs were introduced into protoplasts . the import efficiency was evaluated by immunoblot analysis using an anti _METHOD_ antibody . among the double mutant constructs a large number of mutants exhibited significantly lower import efficiencies compared with their single mutants . these results indicate that contains numerous additional motifs . the double ala substitution mutants were grouped into two different categories . in one group the substitution of either single motif caused negligible inhibitory effects on import efficiency but simultaneous substitution of both motifs caused an import efficiency reduction > . in the second group ala substitution of single subdivisions did not have any effect on import efficiency but their ala substitutions greatly aggravated the import efficiency of other mutants that had ala substitution on critical motifs such as those in and . the motifs in the first and second groups were defined as functionally compensatory and synergistic respectively . among the double substitution mutants _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ belonged to the first group . these mutants exhibited significant defects in mitochondrial protein import although their single ala substitution mutants did not significantly affect protein import efficiency . _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ which had ala substitutions in a combination of two subdivisions primarily produced precursors with only a small portion of processed _METHOD_ . thus these mutants yielded import efficiencies of and at hat respectively . in addition _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ produced a small portion of intermediate _METHOD_ . however despite the lower import efficiency all of these mutants produced the typical mitochondrial pattern indicating that they are targeted to mt but not imported into mt . consistent with this hypothesis precursors of these constructs were detected in the _LOCATION_ fraction following ultracentrifugation . the behavior of the processed _METHOD_ differed slightly among these constructs . the processed _METHOD_ of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ were detected in the soluble fraction but the processed form of _METHOD_ was detected in the pellet fraction . to further define the steps affected by mutations of these motifs the thermolysin sensitivity of these constructs was examined . all the mutants were resistant to thermolysin . however when pretreated with triton x the mutants became sensitive to thermolysin and produced the kd form with the exception of _METHOD_ . this mutant appeared completely degraded . it is possible that when these constructs were trapped at the import channel the _METHOD_ moiety of _METHOD_ was unfolded so that it became sensitive to thermolysin whereas the _METHOD_ moiety of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ exists as a folded form . mitochondrial proteins are unfolded during transport through the import channel . the second group contained six constructs _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ . these constructs exhibited a great reduction in protein import efficiency compared with their corresponding single ala substitution mutants . _METHOD_ contained ala substitutions in both and . the single substitution mutations in and had a moderate effect and almost no effect on protein import yielding and import efficiency at hat respectively . however _METHOD_ yielded an import efficiency of only indicating that simultaneous mutations in both and greatly hamper protein import into mt . _METHOD_ produced the typical mitochondrial pattern indicating that it is targeted to mt but not imported into mt . consistent with the images both precursor and processed _METHOD_ were detected in the _LOCATION_ fraction following ultracentrifugation . in addition the processed form was resistant but became sensitive to thermolysin when pretreated with triton x indicating its tight association with mitochondrial _LOCATION_ . these results suggest that the sequence motif in functions cooperatively with for translocation through the _LOCATION_ . _METHOD_ containing ala substitutions in both and showed very little processed form at hat indicating that the mutation alone does not have much inhibitory effect on protein import efficiency but has a strong inhibitory effect when combined with the mutation . when examined under a _METHOD_ microscope no _METHOD_ signal was detected . when _METHOD_ is trapped at the chloroplast envelope _LOCATION_ it does not fold properly and as a result does not produce _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . thus _METHOD_ may have been trapped in the _LOCATION_ in an unfolded form . to test this hypothesis protoplasts were immunostained with anti _METHOD_ antibody and the localization of _METHOD_ was examined . a punctate staining pattern was evident indicating that it was targeted at the mitochondrial _LOCATION_ . consistent with this localization pattern the precursor of _METHOD_ was detected in the _LOCATION_ fraction . moreover the protein was resistant but became sensitive to thermolysin when pretreated with triton x . similar to _METHOD_ the protein was completely degraded by thermolysin following triton x treatment . these results suggest that the motif in functions together with the motif in for translocation through the import channel . _METHOD_ containing ala substitutions in and produced only small amounts of intermediate _METHOD_ but no processed _METHOD_ . mutation of alone resulted in import efficiency but mutation of alone did not affect import efficiency indicating that the mutation greatly aggravates the moderate inhibitory effect of the mutation . when examined with a _METHOD_ microscope _METHOD_ produced a diffuse _LOCATION_ pattern . when separated by ultracentrifugation significant amounts of the protein were detected in both the soluble and the pellet fractions . however the majority of the protein was sensitive to thermolysin even in the absence of triton x treatment . these results suggest that the two motifs in and are crucial for binding to mt . additionally the motif in functions cooperatively with that in . _METHOD_ contained ala substitutions in both and . this mutant exhibited < import efficiency at hat but _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ exhibited and import efficiencies respectively . image analysis revealed an aggregate pattern in the _LOCATION_ . when fractionated by ultracentrifugation the precursors were detected in the pellet fraction . this is likely due to aggregation of the protein . in addition the protein was sensitive to thermolysin similar to _METHOD_ . this is consistent with a _LOCATION_ localization . these results suggest that the combined mutations in the sequence motifs of and affect an early transport step such as the binding of proteins to mt during protein import into mt . _METHOD_ contained ala substitutions in and and was localized to mt . however this mutant displayed an import efficiency of at hat . when separated by ultracentrifugation the precursors were primarily detected in the _LOCATION_ fraction while processed and intermediate _METHOD_ were detected in the soluble fraction . this _METHOD_ that the precursors were trapped at the import channel . in addition the protein was resistant to thermolysin but became sensitive when pretreated with triton x . these results suggest that the motif in may function together with that in for translocation across the _LOCATION_ . _METHOD_ contained ala substitutions in both and . this mutant exhibited an import efficiency of < and primarily produced the precursor form . in comparison the import efficiency of _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ was and respectively . however _METHOD_ showed a mitochondrial pattern indicating mitochondrial targeting . consistent with this result the precursors were primarily detected in the pellet fraction and sensitive to thermolysin even in the absence of triton x suggesting that _METHOD_ is loosely associated with mt . thus the motif in may cooperatively function with the dqeeg in at an earlier translocation step . to better understand the mechanism of mitochondrial protein import the role of the _PROTEIN_ receptors was examined . plant cells contain multiple types of import receptors at the _PROTEIN_ . these include primary import receptors and _PROTEIN_ which are likely to contain secondary binding sites that function in passing the precursor protein through the _PROTEIN_ as described by the binding chain hypothesis and metaxin _PROTEIN_ and small _METHOD_ that are also likely to contain secondary binding sites . for four _METHOD_ exist in the arabidopsis genome . three of these _METHOD_ to are known to be _PROTEIN_ and functional . to examine the role of these import receptors protoplasts were prepared from triple mutant plants . these protoplasts were transformed with _METHOD_ and its localization was examined . in the triple mutant protoplasts _METHOD_ produced primarily the punctate staining pattern with a minor diffuse _LOCATION_ pattern suggesting that the import efficiency was slightly affected in the mutants . to determine its import efficiency in the mutants protein extracts from the transformed protoplasts were analyzed by immunoblotting using anti _METHOD_ antibody . the amount of the kd processed form at hat was _PROTEIN_ by in triple mutant protoplasts compared with the wild type protoplasts . this result is consistent with the image analysis results . the import efficiency of _METHOD_ in or protoplasts _PROTEIN_ to < at hat compared with the wild type protoplasts . additionally the mutation did not significantly affect the import efficiency of _METHOD_ indicating that the are functionally redundant . this is consistent with results obtained from in vitro import experiments . the protein import of _METHOD_ was also examined in _PROTEIN_ mutant protoplasts and the import efficiency was identical to that of wild type protoplasts . next the sequence motif involved in binding was identified . it was reasoned that the protein import efficiency of the ala substitution mutants of binding sites in triple mutant protoplasts should be identical to the wild type . thus the protein import efficiencies of various ala substitution mutants in wild type and triple mutant protoplasts were compared . from the various ala substitution mutants _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ were selected for transformation into triple mutants or wild type protoplasts . the import efficiency was determined by immunoblot analysis using an anti _METHOD_ antibody . among the four mutants _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ had a or higher _PROTEIN_ in import efficiency in the triple mutant protoplasts compared with that of _METHOD_ in the wild type protoplasts indicating that these three mutants still exhibit dependent protein import into mt . by contrast the import efficiency of _METHOD_ in triple mutant protoplasts was similar to that of the wild type protoplasts indicating that _METHOD_ no longer exhibits dependent protein import into mt . it is possible that iaarp in is involved in dependent protein import into mt . to further confirm this hypothesis we generated a new mutant _METHOD_ that contained a deletion of the region . the import efficiency of this mutation was examined in triple mutant and wild type protoplasts . the import efficiency was identical in both triple mutant and the wild type protoplasts supporting the hypothesis that the iaarp motif is involved in dependent protein import into mt . indeed iaarp in together with the neighboring amino acid ile in _METHOD_ to the consensus sequence of binding sites .
arabidopsis thaliana was grown on gamborg plates at relative humidity and with a h light/dark cycle . leaf tissues were harvested from d old plants and used immediately for protoplast isolation . single gene knockout mutants triple knockout mutant and _PROTEIN_ knockout mutant _PROTEIN_ were isolated from the t dna insertion lines . construction of _PROTEIN_ ps _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was described previously . pss of and were isolated by pcr using a forward primer containing the first bases of the ps and a reverse primer containing last bases of the ps and bases corresponding to the n terminal five amino acids of _METHOD_ . the pcr product containing the ps was fused to _METHOD_ by pcr using the forward and nos t primers . the pcr based mutagenesis approach was used to generate various substitution or deletion mutations in the ps of as described previously . two complementary forward and reverse primers were designed for each mutant . using these primers the first round of pcr was performed to generate and fragments using _METHOD_ as a template . the fragments were amplified using the reverse primers and the common cauliflower mosaic virus primer . the fragments were amplified

round as templates . for ala substitution mutations in two amino acid subdivisions the appropriate individual amino acid subdivision mutants were used as templates . the mutations were introduced as

pseudocolor format . for mitotracker staining the transformed protoplasts were incubated in media containing nm mitotracker red in the dark for min . after staining the protoplasts were washed twice with fresh media and observed with a _METHOD_ microscope after h of incubation . immunohistochemistry was performed as described previously . transformed protoplasts stained with mitotracker red were placed on poly l lys coated glass slides and fixed by paraformaldehyde . the fixed protoplasts were washed with _PROTEIN_ buffer _PROTEIN_ three times and incubated with an anti _METHOD_ antibody for h at . the protoplasts were then washed and incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate conjugated goat anti mouse igg for h at room temperature . protein extracts were prepared from transformed protoplasts as described previously . monoclonal anti _METHOD_ or rabbit polyclonal anti _METHOD_ antibodies were used as the primary antibody to detect _METHOD_ proteins . the amount of proteins on the immunoblots was quantified by measuring the band intensity using multi gauge _PROTEIN_ and imagej . transformed protoplasts were harvested and suspended in sonication buffer . cellular _LOCATION_ were disrupted by sonication . after discarding debris the soluble fractions were subjected to ultracentrifugation at for h. soluble and pellet fractions were collected separately and placed in denaturation buffer _PROTEIN_ . anti porin anti _PROTEIN_ and anti idh antibodies were used to confirm the separation of the _LOCATION_ soluble and mitochondrial _PROTEIN_ proteins respectively . protoplasts were collected in microtubes and gently lysed in _METHOD_ buffer by pipetting times . thermolysin was added to each sample as described previously and the samples were incubated for min on ice . in addition samples were treated with triton x to solubilize the mitochondrial _LOCATION_ . subsequently the protein extracts were analyzed by immunoblotting using the anti _METHOD_ antibody . the sequences of _LOCATION_ encoded mitochondrial proteins from arabidopsis were obtained from the swiss prot database . from these sequences we selected mitochondrial proteins that had been confirmed to be located in the mitochondrial _PROTEIN_ or inner _LOCATION_ . a global sequence alignment between the pss of these proteins and two sequence motifs was performed as described previously . met
