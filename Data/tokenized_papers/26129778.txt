epigenetic regulation of gene _PROTEIN_ is critical for controlling embryonic properties during the embryo to seedling phase transition . here we report that a histone _PROTEIN_ associated regulator scarecrow _PROTEIN_ is essential for repressing the seed maturation programme in vegetative tissues . _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ in and _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ predominantly localizes to the vascular bundles particularly in the phloem companion cells and neighbouring specialized cells . mutation of _PROTEIN_ leads to a global shift in gene _PROTEIN_ in seedlings to a profile resembling _PROTEIN_ embryogenesis in seeds . in _PROTEIN_ seedlings many genes involved in seed maturation are markedly derepressed with concomitant accumulation of seed globulin this is correlated with elevated levels of histone acetylation at a subset of seed specific loci . _PROTEIN_ physically interacts with _PROTEIN_ and direct targets of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ association are identified . these studies reveal that _PROTEIN_ acts as an _PROTEIN_ associated regulator to repress embryonic traits in seedlings .
to identify proteins that interact with _PROTEIN_ the full length arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ fused to the yeast dna binding domain was used as bait to screen an arabidopsis seedling cdna library . a total of yeast transformants were screened yielding nine positive clones . one of these clones encoded _PROTEIN_ which is also designated as _PROTEIN_ based on its genetic interaction with two petunia hairy meristem homologues _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . comparison of deduced amino acid sequences showed that _PROTEIN_ and the ham homologues _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were fairly divergent showing only identity at the amino acid level . _PROTEIN_ shared amino acid identity with an auxin responsive _PROTEIN_ interacting protein in brassica napus and a member of the plant specific _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ acid _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ protein family . phylogenetic analysis of all the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ proteins confirmed their relationships . most _PROTEIN_ domain proteins identified so far are _LOCATION_ proteins and _PROTEIN_ was shown to be _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ localized . to confirm the _LOCATION_ localization of _PROTEIN_ a transient _PROTEIN_ assay was conducted in tobacco epidermal cells with a soluble modified red shifted green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ translational fusion . the _PROTEIN_ smrs _METHOD_ was localized only in the _LOCATION_ indicating that _PROTEIN_ is a _LOCATION_ restricted _PROTEIN_ protein . to corroborate the physical association between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ detected in the yeast two hybrid system three kinds of assays were conducted . first in vitro _PROTEIN_ pull down affinity assays were performed . methionine labelled _PROTEIN_ protein was tested for its ability to interact with recombinant _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ fusion protein . _PROTEIN_ bound to _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ fusion protein but not to _PROTEIN_ alone . second bifc assays in arabidopsis protoplasts were carried out . _PROTEIN_ was fused to the n terminal yellow _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ fragment and _PROTEIN_ was fused to the c terminal _METHOD_ fragment . a yellow _METHOD_ signal was observed when _PROTEIN_ n _METHOD_ was co delivered into protoplasts with _PROTEIN_ c _METHOD_ . third a co ip experiment was performed using _LOCATION_ protein extracts from roots of homozygous _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgenic plants that were in an _PROTEIN_ background and had been used for the complementation assays . this assay showed that _PROTEIN_ co precipitated with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . these results provide good evidence that _PROTEIN_ physically interacts with _PROTEIN_ in the _LOCATION_ of arabidopsis cells . to test whether _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ interaction affects the histone acetylation status at a target promoter a _PROTEIN_ fusion was used to co transform a yeast line with _PROTEIN_ . the yeast strain _PROTEIN_ harbours an integrated lacz gene under the control of the _PROTEIN_ promoter and is regulated by distinct responsive upstream activating sequences . co transformation of _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ resulted in reduced galactosidase activity when compared with _PROTEIN_ alone or empty vectors . chromatin immunoprecipitation _PROTEIN_ assays were then conducted to investigate whether co _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ led to changes in the histone acetylation state at the _PROTEIN_ promoter . the histone acetylation levels around the sites were significantly reduced when both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were _PROTEIN_ compared with _PROTEIN_ or the vectors alone . this suggests that _PROTEIN_ recruits _PROTEIN_ to the target promoter via a gene specific dna binding domain to _PROTEIN_ the local histone acetylation levels . for the functional analysis of _PROTEIN_ in planta we obtained two independent t dna insertion lines for the _PROTEIN_ gene namely _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . based on the available description of the two t dna insertion lines the t dna insertion site was located in the coding region of _PROTEIN_ gene and bp downstream of the translation start site respectively . both of the t dna insertions were located in the region encoding the pfyre domain of _PROTEIN_ protein . no transcript was detected in the homozygous mutant plants using reverse transcription pcr analysis with primers that either spanned the t dna insertions or were downstream of the insertion sites . however rt pcr products were amplified when using primers located upstream of the t dna insertions . this result indicates that transcription of the full length _PROTEIN_ in the mutant plants is disrupted by the t dna insertion but that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ could be hypomorphic rather than null mutations . there were no significant abnormalities in plant growth in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ plants as previously described although they exhibited differences in vegetative growth and development from the wild type before the mid stage of plant development . the mutant seedlings were smaller than those of the wild type and flowering was delayed by to days in long days when compared with the wild type . the mean rosette leaf numbers of the _PROTEIN_ and wild type plants were and respectively . the _PROTEIN_ adult plants at the day old stage were still shorter than the wild type but subsequently caught up and had a life cycle from germination to mature seeds of about the same duration as wild type plants . to confirm the phenotypes exhibited in _PROTEIN_ mutant plants complementation assays were conducted . the _PROTEIN_ genomic sequence fused to _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was used to transform _PROTEIN_ mutant plants . five independent transgenic lines displaying a segregation ratio in populations were selected and two of the homozygous lines compl and compl were chosen for the complementation assays . the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein was able to complement the _PROTEIN_ mutant phenotypes . there was no difference between the phenotypes of complemented lines and wild type plants in _METHOD_ of seedling establishment flowering and plant growth indicating that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein is functional . aba auxin sugar and ga are important cues that guide seed maturation and the transition to seed germination . the effect of aba sugar and auxin on _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was tested . the level of _PROTEIN_ transcript increased substantially in response to aba and sucrose whereas _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was only moderately altered by auxin treatment . the specific _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in vascular tissues particularly in the root phloem system and _PROTEIN_ seed coat has been suggested from information in in silico databases the bar arabidopsis _METHOD_ browser _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and genevestigator . to confirm the _PROTEIN_ pattern we analysed _PROTEIN_ promoter _PROTEIN_ activity and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein localization . the _PROTEIN_ promoter gus construct was generated by fusing the kb fragment directly upstream of the _PROTEIN_ start codon to the gus reporter gene and six independent transformants were analysed . in transgenic arabidopsis plants strong gus staining was observed in the vascular tissues of cotyledons leaves stamen filaments and primary and _PROTEIN_ roots . during seed development _PROTEIN_ gus _PROTEIN_ was not detected in the embryo whereas a strong gus signal was found in the funiculi and _PROTEIN_ regions of ovules and mature seeds as well as the vasculature of silique walls . a more detailed analysis of _PROTEIN_ gus _PROTEIN_ pattern was performed using a dissecting microscope . gus activity was exclusively restricted to the vascular bundles in mature root and a stronger signal was detected on the abaxial sides of root and stem vascular bundles whereas no gus activity was found in the adaxial xylem vessels . in vegetative apices gus activity was observed in the newly formed leaf primordia and the vasculatures of older leaf primordia . _PROTEIN_ localization was examined in vascular tissues of the _PROTEIN_ mutant _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ that had been used for the complementation assays . the _METHOD_ signal occurred in the phloem ccs as well as in the neighbouring tissues . in leaf petiole the signal was apparent in the ccs and neighbouring bundle sheath cells . at the root tip _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was predominantly localized in protophloem sieve elements and neighbouring phloem pole pericycle cells . in mature roots the signal was restricted to the _LOCATION_ of metaphloem ccs and the pp cells . in developing seeds _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was _PROTEIN_ in the ccs of _PROTEIN_ ends of the ovule funiculi a tissue that connects the ovule to the ovary wall . interestingly a strong _METHOD_ signal was also present in the placentochalaza a region that is in close proximity to the ccs at the base of the funiculus vasculature and is thought to function as a nutrient unloading zone particularly for the export of amino acids . microarray analysis on _PROTEIN_ and wild type seedlings was performed to obtain global changes in gene _PROTEIN_ caused by _PROTEIN_ mutation . global gene _PROTEIN_ patterns in wild type and the _PROTEIN_ mutant seedlings were profoundly different such that genes were at least twofold upregulated and genes were more than twofold downregulated in the mutant relative to the wild type from three biological replicates with a benjamini hochberg false discovery rate of . to evaluate the upregulated genes bingo analysis was used to assign gene ontology categories to the genes that showed more than threefold higher _PROTEIN_ in the mutant seedlings . most of the over represented go categories in the classification system biological function related to reproduction with two distinct subcategories stress response and seed development . the seed development group of genes related to those that are fundamental for various aspects of seed maturation and seed filling namely genes encoding seed storage proteins _PROTEIN_ and oleosins . the stress response group of genes were linked with environmental stress responses and hormone signalling such as dehydration cold stress and aba signalling . however a closer analysis of the corresponding genes revealed that most of them are also involved in embryogenesis and seed maturation . besides reproduction and response to stimuli a few additional small categories were also over represented including genes involved in lipid localization and vascular protein processing . these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ represses a large subset of seed maturation genes during the embryonic phase to seedling transition and during seedling establishment . the dna microarray results for embryonic genes that were markedly upregulated in _PROTEIN_ mutant seedlings were validated using real time rt pcr . the tested genes are important in regulating initiation of the seed maturation programme _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ seed reserve trafficking and processing _LOCATION_ tonoplast intrinsic protein _PROTEIN_ and reticulon family gene _PROTEIN_ and accumulation _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . consistent with the microarray data all of the genes noted above were upregulated in the mutant seedlings . several were more than fold upregulated which included a seed specific _PROTEIN_ gene _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . moreover the _PROTEIN_ of these seed maturation genes in _PROTEIN_ seedlings _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ did not differ from wild type plants . these results demonstrate that the ectopic _PROTEIN_ of a subset of embryonic genes in seedlings is attributable to a defect in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and suggest that derepression of seed maturation genes in _PROTEIN_ seedlings is mediated by upstream regulators in a manner analogous to that occurring in developing wild type seeds . to further investigate the extent to which the seed maturation prapram was derepressed in the mutant seedlings we analysed _PROTEIN_ for the presence of seed storage globulins . immunoblot analysis was conducted using monoclonal anti _PROTEIN_ antibody against proteins extracted from week old seedlings . as shown in an unprocessed kda proglobulin as well as globulin species accumulated in untreated _PROTEIN_ seedlings and accumulation of these proteins was increased after treatment with aba . globulins were not observed in untreated wild type seedlings however accumulation of these proteins was detected after aba treatment although at much lower levels when compared with the aba treated _PROTEIN_ seedlings . these findings indicates that in vegetative tissues aba contributes to the derepression of genes encoding seed storage proteins . _PROTEIN_ was strongly _PROTEIN_ in the vascular tissues of silique walls funiculi and _PROTEIN_ regions of ovules and developing seeds . therefore the _PROTEIN_ of various seed maturation genes was examined including _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in developing siliques corresponding to embryo morphogenesis _PROTEIN_ mature _PROTEIN_ and post mature _PROTEIN_ stages of embryo development . seeds were matured and completely dry after _PROTEIN_ . all seed maturation genes tested in siliques of _PROTEIN_ mutant at _PROTEIN_ were significantly upregulated showing similar _PROTEIN_ levels to that in seedlings . heart to linear stage _PROTEIN_ of seed development is specialized in cellularization and tissue type differentiation before storage reserve accumulation . however transcripts of these genes were downregulated at the mature stage of embryo development and even further repressed at the post mature stage compared with the wild type . _PROTEIN_ is capable of forming a multiprotein complex for the repression of gene _PROTEIN_ via histone deacetylation and is involved in the repression of many seed maturation genes in arabidopsis seedlings by reducing _PROTEIN_ levels . _PROTEIN_ assay was performed to determine whether _PROTEIN_ mutation affected histone acetylation at seed specific loci that were derepressed in mutant seedlings . increased acetyl levels were found at the translational start regions and/or the proximal promoter regions in a subset of seed maturation genes in _PROTEIN_ seedlings . these changes in histone acetylation state at the proximal promoter regions for derepressed seed genes in _PROTEIN_ seedlings were restored to the wild type levels in the presence of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . histone acetylation levels for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were also elevated in the _PROTEIN_ mutant however and acetylation levels for _PROTEIN_ in the mutant were similar to those in the wild type . these results indicate that the ectopic _PROTEIN_ of many embryonic genes in _PROTEIN_ mutant seedlings was due at least in part to increased histone acetylation levels . to verify whether _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ association plays a direct role in the repression of embryonic genes in seedlings _PROTEIN_ assays using anti _PROTEIN_ antibodies were performed in wild type and _PROTEIN_ seedlings . the _PROTEIN_ gene was used as a negative control because it was derepressed without detectable changes in and acetylation levels in _PROTEIN_ seedlings . six embryonic genes encoding _PROTEIN_ oleosins and seed reserve trafficking proteins that were markedly derepressed and displayed a dramatic increase in histone acetylation in _PROTEIN_ seedlings were examined . _PROTEIN_ was significantly enriched in the promoter regions of four genes including the globulin gene _PROTEIN_ the protein storage _LOCATION_ localized _LOCATION_ protein gene _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ processing enzyme gene vpe and the aba responsive seed maturation gene in wild type relative to the _PROTEIN_ mutant seedlings indicating that these genes are direct targets of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ interaction . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ did not show significant differences of _PROTEIN_ enrichment in the examined promoter regions between wild type and the _PROTEIN_ mutant .
