the class iv homeodomain leucine zipper transcription _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ acts in a complex regulatory circuit that regulates the differentiation of trichomes in arabidopsis thaliana . we describe a genetic interaction with homeodomain _PROTEIN_ previously identified as a negative regulator of trichome branching . _PROTEIN_ double mutants display enhanced trichome cell type differentiation defects . transgenic _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ using the _PROTEIN_ promoter partially suppresses trichome phenotypes . vice versa _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ under the control of its native promoter partially complements _PROTEIN_ ectopic branching . since _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ double mutants and the triple mutant display similar trichome differentiation defects we investigated a connection to the myb transcription _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . we show that _PROTEIN_ transcript levels are significantly reduced in shoots from mutants and that _PROTEIN_ can drive the _PROTEIN_ of a _PROTEIN_ promoter fusion to green _METHOD_ protein . yeast one hybrid chromatin immunoprecipitation and in planta reporter gene experiments indicate that an box in the _PROTEIN_ promoter acts as a _PROTEIN_ binding site . taken together our findings reveal a functional redundancy between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ two homeodomain leucine zipper transcription _PROTEIN_ previously thought to mediate opposing functions in trichome morphogenesis . a model is proposed in which _PROTEIN_ transcript levels are _PROTEIN_ through a positive feedback loop involving _PROTEIN_ activation of _PROTEIN_ .
_PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are linked loci on arabidopsis chromosome . phylogenetic analysis of the members of the class iv hd zip family does not reveal a high degree of relatedness between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in comparison with other family members . to further probe sequence similarity between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ we divided their protein sequences into four distinct conserved domains hd zlz _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ adjacent domain . the n terminal hd implicated in dna binding is followed by the zlz plant specific leu zipper dimerization domain conserved among members of the class iv family . the _PROTEIN_ domain implicated in ligand binding lies in the middle followed by the sad of unknown function at the c terminus . we determined the percentage amino acid identities and similarities between the four domains of the two proteins in pairwise alignments from protein protein blast and found the hd domain to be most conserved exhibiting and identity and similarity respectively . pairwise alignments were used to compare the hd domain of _PROTEIN_ with each of the other members of the class iv hd zip family . ranking by amino acid identity to _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ placed first followed by _PROTEIN_ and protodermal _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . among the other class iv members whose mrna transcripts are _PROTEIN_ in leaf trichomes _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ exhibits the highest degree of amino acid identity and similarity to _PROTEIN_ . crosses between and _PROTEIN_ plants of the columbia ecotype were performed to construct homozygous double mutants . in comparison with single mutants the double mutants exhibited enhanced trichome differentiation defects . trichome phenotypes were visualized on rosette leaves by stereomicroscopy . leaf trichome morphologies were observed under higher magnification using scanning electron microscopy . while trichome initiation appears not to be altered in single and _PROTEIN_ double mutants outgrowth and differentiation of the trichomes are affected . trichomes are generally aborted on leaves from mutants whereas trichomes at the leaf margins are more differentiated and typically branched with two branches . quantification of trichome outgrowth revealed a significant difference in the number of branched trichomes at the leaf margins in mutants versus _PROTEIN_ double mutants . we observed ectopic branching in _PROTEIN_ mutants as reported previously . on first leaves trichomes with five branches or more were very rare in wild type col while _PROTEIN_ mutants exhibited of the total trichomes with five or more branches . in contrast in _PROTEIN_ double mutants there was a complete absence of branched trichomes while mutants displayed branched trichomes among of the total trichomes on first leaves . trichomes also form on the epidermis of sepals from arabidopsis flowers . analogous deviations in trichome morphogenesis were detected on sepals of _PROTEIN_ and mutants . wild type sepals exhibited unbranched trichomes while _PROTEIN_ sepals showed both unbranched and branched trichomes . mutants exhibited fewer and smaller trichomes while _PROTEIN_ mutants typically lacked trichomes on sepals . using the landsberg _LOCATION_ ecotype as the genetic background we crossed and _PROTEIN_ mutants to produce the corresponding double mutant plants . the quantitative difference between trichome branching on first leaves for single mutants versus _PROTEIN_ double mutants was more striking in the ler genetic background as compared with the col ecotype . we also constructed _PROTEIN_ double mutants and found their trichome cell type differentiation defects enhanced in comparison with siblings . previously it was shown that the trichome differentiation defect of mutants is enhanced in a double mutant for the col alleles and _PROTEIN_ . it was reported that _PROTEIN_ mutants exhibit reduced trichome branching but no obvious defect in trichome patterning and display smaller trichomes . we confirmed the previously reported trichome defects using the _PROTEIN_ mutant allele . the _PROTEIN_ double mutant was constructed and enhanced trichome defects were confirmed for this new allelic combination in the col ecotype . similar to _PROTEIN_ mutants _PROTEIN_ mutants exhibited trichomes that were distinctly smaller and less expanded than trichomes and this was especially apparent at the leaf margins . using scanning electron microscopy to view trichome morphologies in detail we observed trichome differentiation defects in _PROTEIN_ mutants that were analogous to those seen in _PROTEIN_ mutants . quantification of the trichome defects on first leaves indicated that while of the total trichomes in mutants were branched none of the trichomes in the _PROTEIN_ mutants were branched . given the similarity between the leaf trichome phenotypes of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ double mutants we investigated genetic interactions between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in the background . if the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutations affect the same biological pathway in the absence of _PROTEIN_ then the triple mutant _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ would be expected to display similar trichome differentiation defects to either double mutant . indeed we found that the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ triple mutant displays a trichome phenotype resembling the double mutants . quantification of trichomes on first leaves indicated that the triple mutant has a phenotype that is indistinguishable from _PROTEIN_ and examination of first leaves by scanning electron microscopy shows striking similarity between the double and triple mutants . during construction of the triple mutant we observed trichome defects in the progeny from reciprocal crosses between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ whose genotype was homozygous for and heterozygous for both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . unlike mutants that exhibit trichomes on leaf margins the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plants exhibited enhanced trichome defects similar to those of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ double mutants . unexpectedly we also uncovered fertility defects that were associated with inviable pollen from plants heterozygous for _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ or both . however these phenotypes were found to be independent of _PROTEIN_ . double mutants for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were found to exhibit an intermediate trichome phenotype lacking the ectopic branching of _PROTEIN_ mutants while showing significantly fewer two branched trichomes than _PROTEIN_ mutants . this suggests that in the presence of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ act in parallel to orchestrate trichome cell differentiation and _PROTEIN_ is not required for this inhibitory function of _PROTEIN_ . after establishing the enhanced trichome cell differentiation defects in _PROTEIN_ double mutants we investigated phenotypes in roots and seeds other tissues that are affected in single mutants . in the root epidermis mutants exhibit an increase in the proportion of cells that are specified for root hair fate . we observed excess root hair formation on primary roots of _PROTEIN_ double mutants from both the col and ler backgrounds but did not detect an enhanced defect as compared with single mutants . mutants also exhibit a defect in the production of seed coat mucilage upon imbibition . using ruthenium red staining for pectin in the seed coat mucilage we observed that _PROTEIN_ double mutants lack the mucilage layer in a manner that is indistinguishable from single mutants . in addition to defects in the epidermis mutants accumulate higher levels of oil in the seed and this phenotype is associated with the lack of seed coat mucilage . we also found that _PROTEIN_ double mutants display a similar increase in seed oil levels to single mutants . similarly examination of _PROTEIN_ mutants for root hair and seed mucilage phenotypes revealed no obvious enhanced or novel phenotypes relative to the single mutants consistent with the idea that the genetic interaction with _PROTEIN_ is also specific to trichomes . we used the kb promoter upstream of _PROTEIN_ to _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in trichomes from _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants . an n terminal enhanced yellow _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ tag was used to monitor the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in transgenic lines . as a control we utilized an _PROTEIN_ mutant construct that is missing the first residues of the predicted protein and therefore lacking the hd and zlz domains as well as part of the _PROTEIN_ domain . the trichome phenotypes of representative _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ lines as visualized by scanning electron microscopy were unchanged indicating that this construct is null for _PROTEIN_ activity . by contrast scanning electron microscopy analysis showed that the wild type _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ construct fully complements the trichome branching defect of _PROTEIN_ mutants . its _PROTEIN_ was also sufficient to induce increased branching of trichomes at leaf margins in the _PROTEIN_ double mutant consistent with complementation of the _PROTEIN_ mutant phenotype . however the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ construct only partially rescued the trichome differentiation defect of mutants on first leaves and leaves from rosettes . unexpectedly novel transient dwarf phenotypes were observed at the rosette stage for both and _PROTEIN_ mutants transformed with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . in all three genetic backgrounds _PROTEIN_ of the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion protein was monitored in trichomes and found to be localized in _LOCATION_ of trichome cells . quantification of trichomes on first leaves revealed a significant difference in the branching and/or number of trichomes for mutant lines _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . for _PROTEIN_ mutant plants _PROTEIN_ the wild type _PROTEIN_ transgene of trichomes had five or more branches in comparison with the control in which of the trichomes exhibited five or more branches . thus _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ under the control of the _PROTEIN_ promoter is sufficient for rescue of the _PROTEIN_ branching phenotype . in mutant plants _PROTEIN_ the wild type _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ transgene an fold increase in average trichome numbers and more branching on first leaves were observed but overall trichome formation was partial in comparison with the wild type . for the _PROTEIN_ double mutant branching and trichome cell type differentiation were restored to approximately the levels in mutants as indicated by an fold increase in visible trichomes and more branching . we also _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in mutants using the epidermis specific kb _PROTEIN_ promoter from class iv hd zip transcription _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ transgenic lines exhibited increased trichome cell type differentiation in comparison with untransformed control plants . however the trichome cell type differentiation was partial resulting in an increase in _PROTEIN_ one to two branched and rarely three branched trichomes . additional phenotypes such as leaf curling and novel pointy leaf shapes were also observed in conjunction with trichome formation suggesting that the ectopic _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ either induces or interferes with other cell type differentiation pathways in the epidermis . in roots we detected a partial rescue of the excess root hair phenotype of mutants in transgenic lines _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in comparison with the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ negative control . a complete rescue of the root hair phenotype was conferred by the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ transgene . this construct in which _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ under the control of its native promoter was shown previously to completely rescue the trichome defects of mutants . the _PROTEIN_ of mutant or wild type _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ did not alter the root hair phenotype of _PROTEIN_ mutants which appears indistinguishable from that of the wild type . however in seeds the _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ had a negative effect on mucilage formation in comparison with the control resulting in a phenotype . although _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was able to complement the seed mucilage phenotype of there was no visible rescue of the seed coat mucilage phenotype in mutants by the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ transgene . taken together these data indicate that the ability of _PROTEIN_ to partially rescue the phenotype and/or interfere with _PROTEIN_ activity is tissue specific . since _PROTEIN_ overexpression in trichomes can partially rescue the trichome and root hair phenotypes of we asked whether _PROTEIN_ overexpression is able to complement the ectopic branching phenotype of _PROTEIN_ mutants . we _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ mutants and observed partial complementation of the ectopic branching phenotype . scanning electron microscopy analysis showed that in comparison with the control lacking the transgene _PROTEIN_ mutants _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ exhibited fewer trichomes having five or more branches . _PROTEIN_ of the transgene was associated with _LOCATION_ localization of the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ protein in trichomes . quantification of trichomes on first leaves revealed a significant difference in _PROTEIN_ mutants _PROTEIN_ the transgene versus the controls lacking the transgene . _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ transgene also led to an increase in the average total number of trichomes on first leaves of _PROTEIN_ mutants suggesting that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ can drive trichome cell type specification in the absence of _PROTEIN_ . to further dissect the genetic interactions between _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ we monitored their respective mrna transcripts in seedlings from the col wild type _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ as well as the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ double mutants . mrna was isolated from d old seedling shoots to enrich for transcript levels in trichomes . quantitative real time pcr confirmed that the and _PROTEIN_ alleles are rna knockdown alleles while _PROTEIN_ mutants do not exhibit a reduced level of mrna _PROTEIN_ in shoots . it was shown previously that for root tips from _PROTEIN_ transcript levels in _PROTEIN_ are reduced to of wild type levels . the _PROTEIN_ root hair phenotype was reported to be indistinguishable from that of the transcript null allele _PROTEIN_ indicating that although a transcript is _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ it is not functional . _PROTEIN_ mrna levels were _PROTEIN_ only in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . by contrast our analysis revealed that _PROTEIN_ mrna levels were significantly reduced in single mutants as well as in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ double mutants . the real time pcr data are consistent with the possibility that _PROTEIN_ is a direct transcriptional target of _PROTEIN_ . previously it was shown that a _PROTEIN_ construct containing the _PROTEIN_ promoter was sufficient to rescue the trichome defect in _PROTEIN_ mutants . the kb promoter of _PROTEIN_ contains two putative boxes that are heptamer/octamer elements shown to be required for dna binding of _PROTEIN_ . the first box i located kb upstream of the start codon of _PROTEIN_ is a perfect match in reverse orientation to the box described for the _PROTEIN_ regulated cellulose _PROTEIN_ and xyloglucan _PROTEIN_ promoters . the second box ii located bp downstream from box i has a one base mismatch adjacent to the conserved heptamer sequence . we used a yeast one hybrid assay to test whether _PROTEIN_ is able to bind to the box motifs found in the _PROTEIN_ promoter . the results indicate that _PROTEIN_ binds to the wild type box i sequence but not a mutated version thereof . in contrast _PROTEIN_ was not able to bind to the imperfect sequence represented by box ii . we also examined whether _PROTEIN_ is able to bind to the motifs and failed to detect binding activity to either box . the experiments indicate that _PROTEIN_ binds one of the boxes in the _PROTEIN_ promoter whereas _PROTEIN_ is unable to bind that same sequence in the yeast system . the box motifs in the _PROTEIN_ promoter were compared with motifs identified for other known direct targets of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . to further test the idea that _PROTEIN_ binds to an box in the _PROTEIN_ promoter we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation _PROTEIN_ on seedlings from a _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ transgenic line . using an anti green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ antibody to purify protein dna complexes containing _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ we isolated _PROTEIN_ dna and performed quantitative real time pcr . the results indicate that dna containing the box region of the _PROTEIN_ promoter is enriched to a similar level as a positive control dna corresponding to an box containing region from the _PROTEIN_ promoter . the percentage input values are significantly increased relative to the _PROTEIN_ negative control indicating that _PROTEIN_ binds to both the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ promoters in seedlings . to test whether box i is required for transcriptional activation of _PROTEIN_ by _PROTEIN_ we transiently _PROTEIN_ a reporter composed of the kb promoter upstream of _PROTEIN_ fused to _METHOD_ in nicotiana benthamiana . low levels of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ were observed in controls that _PROTEIN_ the reporter alone . a marked increase in _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was observed in epidermal cells that coexpressed _PROTEIN_ . however no activation above the basal level was detected for cells that coexpressed _PROTEIN_ . an fold _PROTEIN_ in activation by _PROTEIN_ was observed for a mutant reporter that lacked box i indicating that the box is required for maximal activation . a naturally occurring mutation is found within box i of the arabidopsis accession guckingen . hierarchical clustering based on pairwise sequence differences among accessions indicated that col is the most closely related accession to gu . strikingly we observed significantly fewer four branched trichomes on first leaves from gu in comparison with col consistent with compromised _PROTEIN_ function . real time pcr experiments indicated that gu shoots _PROTEIN_ lower levels of _PROTEIN_ transcripts consistent with a function for box i in the full activation of _PROTEIN_ by _PROTEIN_ .
