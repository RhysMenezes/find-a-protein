ran is a multifunctional small _PROTEIN_ that is involved in nucleocytoplasmic transport mitotic spindle assembly and _LOCATION_ envelope formation . _LOCATION_ import of ran relies on a small rangdp binding protein _LOCATION_ transport _PROTEIN_ . three proteins are _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis that show significant sequence similarity to human and yeast . here we demonstrate that two of them and can functionally replace the essential gene in yeast . consistent with this finding both and interact with yeast and arabidopsis ran . the third related protein atntl does not functionally replace in yeast . similar to yeast green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ accumulate at the _LOCATION_ rim . the and mutants which fail to bind ran are not functional in yeast indicating conservation of the requirement for these key amino acids in plants and yeast . overexpression but not overexpression blocks _LOCATION_ import of a plant transcription _PROTEIN_ in nicotiana benthamiana leaves indicating that excess disrupts _LOCATION_ import in a ran binding dependent manner . on the basis of these results we propose that and function in ran import in arabidopsis and that _LOCATION_ import of ran is functionally conserved in plants .
using the yeast sequence a protein blast search was performed against the translated arabidopsis genome . the two hits with the lowest e values were encoded by the genes _GENE_ and _GENE_ . the third hit had a slightly lower e value but the predicted protein was approximately the same size as other proteins . all other hits represented larger proteins containing like domains adjacent to additional functional domains . the predicted gene products of _GENE_ and _GENE_ were named and respectively and the gene product of _GENE_ was named atntl for arabidopsis like protein . figure shows the alignment of the arabidopsis proteins with human and yeast . while all three gene products share an overall similar degree of conservation an otherwise well conserved amino acid stretch at the extreme c terminus is absent in atntl . and are identical at the amino acid level while and yeast share amino acid identity and and amino acid identity . atntl shares approximately sequence identity with and . all three arabidopsis proteins are more closely related to each other than to the yeast or human proteins indicating that they are paralogs . and are more closely related to yeast than to human with which they share and identity respectively . this level of amino acid conservation is comparable to the identity between yeast and human . human can functionally replace yeast . here we tested whether and atntl are also functional homologs of yeast . a plasmid shuffle assay was performed to determine whether the three arabidopsis proteins could replace the essential yeast protein . this assay tests whether yeast cells that _PROTEIN_ and atntl as the only copy of are viable . cell growth is assessed by serial diluting and spotting . each of the three putative arabidopsis cdnas was cloned into a yeast _PROTEIN_ plasmid under the control of the gal inducible _PROTEIN_ promoter . these plasmids were then transformed into yeast cells where the genomic copy of had been deleted but the cells were _PROTEIN_ by a plasmid borne copy of yeast . as controls the cells were also transformed with a vector alone and yeast cloned into the same yeast _PROTEIN_ vector and _PROTEIN_ from the gal inducible promoter . as shown in figure all the cells grew equally well on the control plates where the yeast _PROTEIN_ plasmid was present . when cells were plated on fluoroorotic acid to eliminate the yeast _PROTEIN_ plasmid the results indicated that both and can function as the sole copy of in vivo . growth of cells _PROTEIN_ each of these plasmids was similar to the growth of cells that _PROTEIN_ the control yeast plasmid . in contrast atntl did not support cell growth . similar results were obtained when we assessed whether the proteins could suppress the temperature sensitive phenotype of two mutant alleles and . both and could suppress the temperature sensitive growth phenotype of these mutants whereas atntl could not . the role of is to transport rangdp into the _LOCATION_ . thus any bona fide protein should interact with ran . since the yeast two hybrid method has been used previously to examine the interaction between ran and this method was used here to analyze the interaction of ran with and . figure shows that both proteins interact with yeast human and arabidopsis ran but not with a control protein . taken together we conclude that and are both true orthologs of their yeast counterpart whereas atntl is not a functional . for to fulfill its essential cellular role it must bind to rangdp . the interaction between and ran has been extensively characterized including the resolution of the crystal structure of the complex . these analyses have revealed key residues within that are absolutely required for ran binding . amino acid changes in yeast and rat lead to loss of interaction with ran and consequent loss of function in vivo . both and contain a conserved glu in position corresponding to in yeast and rat and a conserved glu in position adjacent to the conserved asp mutated in the yeast and the rat mutations . corresponding amino acid changes were incorporated into to create and . if and are functional homologs of then these key conserved amino acid residues should also be critical for their function . we used yeast two hybrid analysis to determine whether these amino acid changes within the binding interface disrupt the interaction between and _PROTEIN_ . as shown in figure both and show significantly _PROTEIN_ interaction with _PROTEIN_ as compared to wild type or . this loss of interaction is not due to a loss of _PROTEIN_ of the mutant proteins as we can readily detect homodimerization of both of the mutant proteins with in a two hybrid assay . figure shows that neither nor is able to functionally replace yeast indicating that their ability to bind ran is required for their function in yeast . this analysis _METHOD_ that like other known homologs the proteins must bind ran in vivo to function and provides further evidence that these are the arabidopsis homologs . the steady state level of mrna _PROTEIN_ in different tissues of flowering arabidopsis plants was assayed by reverse transcription pcr for and . for both and a transcript of approximately bp which corresponds to the expected size of the open reading frame plus an approximately bp untranslated region was detected in all tissues tested . the actin related protein levels were tested using approximately the same amount of rna as used in the and reactions . for all reactions pcr without reverse transcriptase was performed as a negative control and yielded no signal . to investigate whether and _PROTEIN_ are concentrated at the _LOCATION_ envelope similar to what has been observed for yeast and mammalian green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ was fused to the c terminus of both and . the two _METHOD_ fusion proteins and free _METHOD_ were transiently _PROTEIN_ in tobacco by cells under the control of the promoter . figure shows that _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ are concentrated at the _LOCATION_ envelope as well as distributed in the cytoplasm and the _LOCATION_ excluding the nucleolus . this pattern is very similar to the localization patterns of both yeast and mammalian . in addition we tested the localization pattern of _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ in yeast and detected an accumulation at the _LOCATION_ envelope consistent with the pattern observed for . overexpression of in mammalian cells blocks _LOCATION_ import . in yeast overexpression of wild type is slightly dominant negative . to investigate the role of in plant _LOCATION_ import we tested the effect of overexpression on the localization of a _LOCATION_ protein . we used the maize transcription _PROTEIN_ r fused to _METHOD_ as a reporter for _LOCATION_ import and transient _PROTEIN_ based on infiltration of nicotiana benthamiana leaves with agrobacterium as an assay . to confirm the _LOCATION_ localization of r _METHOD_ in n. benthamiana we agroinfiltrated a plasmid containing a promoter driven r _METHOD_ . figure shows that r _METHOD_ localizes exclusively in the _LOCATION_ . next we tested the localization of r _METHOD_ when coexpressed with under control of the promoter . as shown in figure under these conditions r _METHOD_ is located in cytoplasmic aggregates and no _LOCATION_ accumulation is observed . the cytoplasmic aggregation is similar to the localization of truncated r without its nls . the localization of r _METHOD_ is not affected by coexpressing which can not interact with ran . in addition coexpression of two unrelated driven proteins did not alter r _METHOD_ localization . together these results suggest that overexpression of blocks _LOCATION_ import and that this effect depends on the ability of to bind ran .

previously described . the and atntl cdnas were isolated by rt pcr with the primers f _PROTEIN_ r _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ f _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ r _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_

plant mini kit . rt pcr was performed using the prostar hf single tube rt pcr system from stratagene with ng total rna ng of each primer and annealing temperature . the resulting rt pcr products of

created . the plasmids containing the and mutants were named and respectively . to analyze the function of the putative arabidopsis the and atntl open reading frames were cloned into yeast _PROTEIN_ vectors under the control of a gal inducible promoter . as a control yeast was also cloned into a gal inducible vector . each of these plasmids as well as the vector only control was transformed into yeast cells where the endogenous gene had been deleted but the viability of the strain was _PROTEIN_ by the presence of a marked yeast genomic plasmid . to assess the function of the arabidopsis homologs cultures of cells carrying each of the plasmids were grown to saturation serially diluted and then spotted on either control plates or foa gal plates . on control plates the genomic yeast _PROTEIN_ plasmid was retained . thus all cells _PROTEIN_ yeast and grew equally well indicating that similar numbers of cells were spotted for each sample . on the foa plates the marked yeast _PROTEIN_ plasmid was lost . these plates contained gal so the arabidopsis proteins were _PROTEIN_ as was the control yeast . no growth was seen when cells were spotted on foa plates lacking gal . two hybrid/interaction trap constructs were generated by cloning the appropriate genes into either the lexa binding domain plasmid or the acid blob transcriptional activator plasmid . the plasmid is designed so that the activation domain fusion proteins are only _PROTEIN_ in the presence of gal . thus for all experiments plating on glc serves as a negative control as the encoded protein will not be _PROTEIN_ . for this reason valid interactions should be detected only on gal plates and not on glc plates . for all constructs levels of _PROTEIN_ were examined by immunoblotting either with anti lexa antibodies or with anti hemagglutinin antibodies . levels of _PROTEIN_ were approximately equal for all proteins indicating that all fusion proteins had comparable stability and so the failure of some to interact with was not due to their levels of _PROTEIN_ or stability being substantially lower . interactions between proteins were examined by cotransforming and plasmids into the yeast strain _PROTEIN_ . an interaction was scored as positive if the cells were leu and turned blue on bromo chloro indolyl d galactopyranoside indicator plates . the cdnas for and the control gene were
