cellular dna rna and their precursor nucleotides are at high risk of being oxidized by reactive oxygen species . an oxidized base oxo dihydro guanosine can pair with both adenine and cytosine and thus would cause both replicational and translational _LOCATION_ . previously we have reported that an arabidopsis nudix hydrolase _PROTEIN_ acts to hydrolyze an oxidized deoxyribonucleotide oxo dihydro deoxyguanosine triphosphate . here we showed that oxo dgtp pyrophosphohydrolase activity is not exhibited by any other arabidopsis nudix hydrolase . _PROTEIN_ acted on an oxidized ribonucleotide oxo _PROTEIN_ with high affinity . in a transcriptional mutational analysis using the lacz reporter gene the phenotypic suppression of the lacz amber mutation in a mutt deficient escherichia coli strain caused by the misincorporation of oxo _PROTEIN_ into the mrna was significantly diminished by _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ . these findings suggest that _PROTEIN_ prevents transcriptional _LOCATION_ in vivo . a confocal microscopic analysis using a green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ fusion protein demonstrated that _PROTEIN_ is distributed in the _LOCATION_ where the _PROTEIN_ pool of nucleotides in the cells exists . the level of oxo guanosine in genomic dna was significantly increased in knockout _PROTEIN_ plants compared with wild type plants under normal and oxidative stress conditions . the results obtained here indicate that _PROTEIN_ functions in cellular defense against oxidative dna and rna damage through the sanitization of their precursor pools in the _LOCATION_ in arabidopsis cells .
previously we have identified arabidopsis nudix hydrolases that are classified based on their predicted subcellular localization as either _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ mitochondrial _PROTEIN_ or chloroplastic _PROTEIN_ . at that time we analyzed the substrate specificity of recombinant _METHOD_ of all the _LOCATION_ atnudxs except because of the formation of inclusion bodies and showed that only _PROTEIN_ acts on oxo dgtp . recently a blast search revealed an additional three types of the nudix hydrolase gene that are predicted to be located in the _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ and chloroplast _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . at first therefore we tried to identify oxo dgtp pyrophosphohydrolase activity among _LOCATION_ mitochondrial _PROTEIN_ or chloroplastic _PROTEIN_ arabidopsis nudix hydrolases . using the vector pcold tf _PROTEIN_ a trigger _PROTEIN_ chaperone as a soluble tag the recombinant protein was produced with high efficiency in the soluble fraction and then was purified using a hitrap chelating hp column . therefore we could analyze the substrate specificity of the _LOCATION_ recombinant . however the recombinant protein showed no hydrolytic activity toward various nucleoside diphosphate derivatives such as oxo dgtp dgtp dctp datp dttp adp ribose nadh fad coa diadenosine polyphosphate udp _PROTEIN_ and udp galactose . the recombinant _PROTEIN_ protein generated using the _PROTEIN_ vector showed hydrolytic activity toward diadenosine tetraphosphate diadenosine pentaphosphate nadh and coa . next we prepared recombinant proteins from mitochondrial _PROTEIN_ and chloroplastic _PROTEIN_ genes and analyzed their activities toward oxo dgtp dgtp dctp datp and dttp however we could not detect any pyrophosphohydrolase activity by these proteins . furthermore no change in frequency of spontaneous mutations in the e. coli mutt deficient strain was observed with the _PROTEIN_ of mitochondrial and chloroplastic atnudxs . judging from both analyses no oxo dgtp pyrophosphohydrolase was present among these atnudxs . it has been shown that e. coli mutt and catalyze the hydrolysis of not only oxo dgtp but also oxo _PROTEIN_ to the monophosphate . therefore we analyzed the oxo _PROTEIN_ pyrophosphohydrolase activity of _PROTEIN_ . the recombinant _PROTEIN_ protein was active in converting oxo _PROTEIN_ to oxo gmp . the km value for oxo _PROTEIN_ was > fold lower than that of . therefore the recombinant _PROTEIN_ protein was a highly efficient catalyst although its vmax value was lower than that of . next we examined the ability of _PROTEIN_ to eliminate the mismatch evoking oxidized nucleotides from the rna precursor pool using two e. coli lacz strains . cells which carry a mutt mutation produced blue colonies on plates containing x gal through partial phenotypic suppression of the lacz amber mutation caused by the misincorporation of oxo _PROTEIN_ into mrna . on the other hand when the or _PROTEIN_ cdna was introduced into the cells the formation of blue colonies was mostly suppressed to the same degree as for the cells . more quantitative data were obtained by measuring the actual galactosidase activities in cultures of cells harboring plasmids with the _PROTEIN_ cdna . the galactosidase activity in the cells increased approximately fold compared with that in the cells . the increase in activity in the cells was significantly suppressed by the _PROTEIN_ of the or _PROTEIN_ cdna . these results clearly show that _PROTEIN_ as well as can compensate for a lack of mutt in e. coli cells . to clarify the distribution of the defense _METHOD_ protecting against oxidative dna damage in plant cells the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ determined . the _PROTEIN_ cdna was fused in frame with green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ at the c terminus and then introduced into arabidopsis plants . the _METHOD_ of the _METHOD_ fusion proteins in protoplasts prepared from each transgenic arabidopsis plant was monitored using confocal microscopy . _LOCATION_ and chloroplasts were identified by diamidino phenylindole staining and _METHOD_ respectively . _METHOD_ _METHOD_ spread throughout the _LOCATION_ in the protoplasts from _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ plants as an experimental control . similarly the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was detected only in the _LOCATION_ . a wide range of environmental stresses such as high light drought and salinity cause enhanced production of ros . therefore a quantitative reverse transcription pcr analysis was carried out to examine the changes in the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ under various stressful conditions . however the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ was not significantly changed by treatment with paraquat salinity high light and drought . we obtained a t dna knockout line _PROTEIN_ for _PROTEIN_ from the signal project . the t dna insert was located in the second exon of the gene . a semi quantitative rt pcr based analysis was performed to investigate the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ mrna in the ko _PROTEIN_ plants . the quantity of template was verified to be the same in each reaction by amplifying a constitutively _PROTEIN_ actin mrna . all of the amplified fragments were cloned and their sequences confirmed . when two primer sets _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were used for the pcr analysis amplified fragments with lengths of and bp respectively derived from the _PROTEIN_ mrna were detected in the wild type plants . on the other hand no amplified fragment was detected in the ko _PROTEIN_ plants using the primer set _PROTEIN_ . notably an amplified fragment derived from the unspliced _PROTEIN_ mrna containing the intron sequence was detected in the ko _PROTEIN_ plants using the primer set _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . these results indicated that insertion of the t dna into the second exon of _PROTEIN_ in the ko _PROTEIN_ plants resulted in an inhibition of pre mrna splicing . therefore it is clear that no active _PROTEIN_ protein exists in the ko _PROTEIN_ plants since the remaining intron sequence in the _PROTEIN_ mrna causes a frameshift mutation in the nudix motif a conserved active site of nudix hydrolases . in addition to the sanitization of nucleotide pools by a mutt type nudix hydrolase such as _PROTEIN_ there are base excision repair pathways for removing oxidized bases from dna in living _METHOD_ . the pathways in arabidopsis are comprised of a bacterial mutm type oxo g dna glycosylase/lyase a mammalian ogg type oxo g dna glycosylases/lyase _PROTEIN_ and possibly an adenine dna glycosylase/lyase like protein . by the quantitative rt pcr analysis no significant differences in the respective levels of atmyh _PROTEIN_ and atmmh were observed between the wild type and ko _PROTEIN_ plants indicating that the absence of _PROTEIN_ protein has no effect on their _PROTEIN_ . the ko _PROTEIN_ plants did not exhibit any discernible differences in growth phenotype and chlorophyll content from the wild type plants under normal conditions . to investigate the effect of a lack of _PROTEIN_ on oxidative stress tolerance the wild type and ko _PROTEIN_ plants were treated with pq . the amount of chlorophyll in the wild type plants _PROTEIN_ during the exposure to stress . no significant difference was observed in chlorophyll content between the wild type and ko _PROTEIN_ plants under the stressful conditions . next we examined the amount of oxo g in the genomic dna of the wild type and ko _PROTEIN_ plants under normal conditions and oxidative stress by conducting an hplc electrochemical detector based analysis . the level of oxo g in the ko _PROTEIN_ plants was approximately fold higher than that in the wild type plants under normal conditions . furthermore the oxo g level in ko _PROTEIN_ plants was significantly increased under the oxidative stress caused by pq .

coa apna udp _PROTEIN_ and udp galactose nm . the e. coli and strains carry an amber mutation in codon of the lacz gene where the a t to c g transversion mutation is reversed phenotypically to produce the galactosidase . the e. coli cells yield white colonies since they are unable to produce an active galactosidase when cultured in the presence of x gal . on the other hand the cells which carry a mutt mutation in addition to the lacz amber mutation produce blue colonies probably due to the partial phenotypic suppression of the lacz mutation caused by the misincorporation of oxo g into mrna .
