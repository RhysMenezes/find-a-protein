chloroplasts change their position to _PROTEIN_ cellular activities to fluctuating environmental light conditions . phototropins _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ are plant specific blue light photoreceptors that perceive changes in light intensity and direction and mediate actin based chloroplast photorelocation movements . both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ regulate the chloroplast accumulation response while _PROTEIN_ is mostly responsible for the regulation of the avoidance response . although it has been widely accepted that distinct intracellular localizations of phototropins are implicated in the specificity the mechanism underlying the _PROTEIN_ specific avoidance response has remained elusive . in this study we examined the relationship of the _PROTEIN_ localization pattern to the chloroplast photorelocation movement . first the fusion of a _LOCATION_ localization signal with _PROTEIN_ which effectively reduced the amount of _PROTEIN_ in the cytoplasm retained the activity for both the accumulation and avoidance responses indicating that _LOCATION_ localized _PROTEIN_ but not cytoplasmic _PROTEIN_ is functional to mediate the responses . importantly some fractions of _PROTEIN_ and of _PROTEIN_ to a lesser extent were localized on the chloroplast outer _LOCATION_ . moreover the deletion of the c terminal region of _PROTEIN_ which was previously shown to be defective in blue light induced _LOCATION_ localization and avoidance response affected the localization pattern on the chloroplast outer _LOCATION_ . taken together these results suggest that dynamic _PROTEIN_ trafficking from the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ to the _LOCATION_ apparatus and the chloroplast outer _LOCATION_ might be involved in the avoidance response .
_PROTEIN_ shows multiple localization patterns such as the _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ localization the light induced _LOCATION_ association and the cytoplasmic distribution . to characterize the functional role of the _LOCATION_ fraction of _PROTEIN_ we produced transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ and fused with the _LOCATION_ localization signal or _LOCATION_ export signal in the _PROTEIN_ double mutant background under the authentic _PROTEIN_ promoter . we obtained several independent lines of nls and nes in the generation . immunoblot analysis confirmed that these transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ nls and nes at the expected sizes . _PROTEIN_ was in a range of no _PROTEIN_ low _PROTEIN_ moderate _PROTEIN_ and high _PROTEIN_ compared with that of endogenous _PROTEIN_ in the wild type plant . nes _PROTEIN_ was also varied and grouped into high _PROTEIN_ moderate _PROTEIN_ or low _PROTEIN_ compared with that of endogenous _PROTEIN_ in the wild type plant . however nls _PROTEIN_ were lower than that of endogenous _PROTEIN_ in the wild type plant . of those nes and for nes nls and for nls and and for were chosen as representative lines for the following experiments . careful protein fractionation analysis of in transgenic plants indicated that certain amounts of were detected in the soluble fraction compared with endogenous _PROTEIN_ in the wild type and _PROTEIN_ mutant although the majority of was recovered in the pelleted fraction with increased amounts to some extent . as _PROTEIN_ in the line was slightly higher than that in the ratios of in the soluble fraction proportionally increased dependent on the _PROTEIN_ levels of . similarly both nls and nes were also detected _PROTEIN_ in the pelleted fraction rather than the soluble fraction suggesting that the fusion of the nls and nes did not affect the _LOCATION_ localization activity of _PROTEIN_ . however the soluble fraction of nls could be contributed by the _LOCATION_ localized rather than the cytoplasmic localized nls . we next verified the intracellular localizations of nls and nes proteins in the mesophyll and epidermal cells of rosette leaves . the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ of was strongly observed in the cell periphery and faintly in the cytoplasm . the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ of nls was observed not only in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ but also in the _LOCATION_ but no _LOCATION_ signal was observed . on the other hand nes exhibited localization patterns essentially identical to those of . we further verified the intracellular localizations of and nls proteins in comparison with marker proteins using transient _PROTEIN_ in onion epidermal cells . was strongly observed in the cell periphery and the _LOCATION_ and also faintly in the cytoplasm . the cytoplasmic and _LOCATION_ localization of was consistent with the distribution of monomeric red _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ a _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ localization marker . it is noted here that the _LOCATION_ localization of might be artifactual by overexpression in onion epidermal cells because no such distribution was observed in the and nes transgenic arabidopsis cells . in contrast strong nls _PROTEIN_ was observed in the cell periphery and _LOCATION_ but not in the cytoplasm . in addition nls was co localized with _METHOD_ in the _LOCATION_ but not in the _LOCATION_ . both fusion proteins in the periphery were well co localized with the distribution of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ marker h _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . collectively these results indicated that the addition of nls to effectively reduced the cytoplasmic fraction of _PROTEIN_ . the physiological activities of nls and nes on chloroplast movements were assessed by monitoring changes in the red light transmittance in rosette leaves in response to low and high blue light treatments . nes fully complemented the low light induced as well as the high light induced chloroplast movements the higher _PROTEIN_ exhibited a more rapid avoidance response than the moderate _PROTEIN_ as observed in the lines and indicating that nes is fully functional not only in the accumulation response but also in the avoidance response . interestingly nls was fully functional in the accumulation response but its activity for the avoidance response was slightly attenuated compared with those of nes and . collectively these data indicate that cytoplasmic _PROTEIN_ is not essential for chloroplast photorelocation movement although we could not rule out the possibility that the reduced _PROTEIN_ and _LOCATION_ localized extent of nls also affect the activity for the avoidance response . in the accompanying paper we demonstrated that the c terminal deletion mutants g and g but not g showed some attenuation on targeting to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and the _LOCATION_ apparatus . to assess further the relationship between the localization patterns and functionality of _PROTEIN_ in chloroplast photorelocation movement the c terminal deletion mutants g g and g were _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ single and _PROTEIN_ double mutants under the control of the authentic _PROTEIN_ promoter . unfortunately all g and g transgenic lines showed reduced _PROTEIN_ levels compared with the amount of the endogenous _PROTEIN_ in the wild type plants as described by citation . hence we used lines with various _PROTEIN_ levels as controls . although the g and g transgenic plants exhibited a slightly lower _PROTEIN_ of the respective fusion proteins compared with that of endogenous _PROTEIN_ in the wild type plants the _PROTEIN_ was comparable with that of in . because the g transgenic plants showed an accumulation response rather than an avoidance response even under strong light we investigated whether the amount of _PROTEIN_ influenced the threshold between the accumulation and avoidance responses . chloroplast movements in lines were first detected from the changes of red light transmittance through the leaves under various light intensities . both the accumulation and avoidance responses were normally observed even in the low _PROTEIN_ line . in contrast no response was observed in the no _PROTEIN_ line . these results suggest that some amount of is necessary and the low amount in has enough activity to induce both accumulation and avoidance responses . as described by citation the g transgenic plants were fully functional in both the accumulation and avoidance responses and the g transgenic plants were not functional . in contrast the g transgenic plants were only partially functional during the accumulation response there was almost no observed accumulation response under a low intensity blue light but reduced accumulation responses were detected under high intensity blue light indicating that the c terminal region of _PROTEIN_ is involved in the regulation of _PROTEIN_ activity . it is noted that g was only functional for the accumulation response under high intensity blue light while the _PROTEIN_ of g is comparable with that of in the low _PROTEIN_ line . with a different purpose we transformed _PROTEIN_ tap and _PROTEIN_ tapi fusion genes into the _PROTEIN_ double mutants under the control of the authentic _PROTEIN_ promoter and the resulting transgenic plants were named and respectively . the tandem affinity purification method is widely used for the high level purification of protein complexes containing a tap tagged protein . although this tap tag method has proven its usefulness for the identification of proteins in heterocomplexes in yeast mammalian and insect cells using _METHOD_ _METHOD_ its application in plants has been limited to the purification of fully functional protein complexes for the _METHOD_ spectrometric analysis of proteins because of its nls in the calmodulin binding protein domain . a new improved tap tag has improved the usefulness of the tap tag through the elimination of nls signal activity . we found that _PROTEIN_ tap fusion proteins partially complemented the high light avoidance response in _PROTEIN_ double mutants . hence we asked whether the defective phenotype in these lines could be related to the _LOCATION_ localization activity . the _PROTEIN_ of and were similar to or less than that of endogenous _PROTEIN_ . chloroplast movements were measured using red light transmittance on leaves to determine the physiological activities of the _PROTEIN_ fusion proteins . interestingly the transgenic plant leaves with a low _PROTEIN_ exhibited an accumulation response similar to that of the _PROTEIN_ mutants not only under a low intensity but also under high intensity blue light . however the transgenic plant leaves with moderate _PROTEIN_ exhibited an accumulation response under low and middle intensity blue light and an avoidance response under high intensity blue light . similarly the transgenic plants were functional in both chloroplast movements but the higher intensity of blue light was necessary for the avoidance response as in . in addition all of these lines exhibited a normal phototropism response similar to the _PROTEIN_ mutant plants . interestingly the protein fractionation analysis showed that was more sensitive to chaotropic salt treatment compared with endogenous _PROTEIN_ in the wild type plant . these data suggest that the _LOCATION_ association activity of is reduced compared with that of endogenous _PROTEIN_ . collectively these results showed a positive relationship between _LOCATION_ association and physiological activity of _PROTEIN_ . to address further the localization dynamics of phototropins during chloroplast movement we examined the intracellular localization of both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in the palisade cells of and transgenic plants respectively . as shown in fig . the avoidance response was effectively induced by microbeam irradiation using nm laser beam scans in the intervals between image acquisitions using nm laser scans for _METHOD_ fusion proteins . the chloroplasts moved away from the area where the strong blue light was applied . interestingly clear _METHOD_ _METHOD_ of and was observed not only in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ but also in the chloroplast envelope during the chloroplast movement . to compare directly the localization patterns and the endogenous levels of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in leaf cells we produced transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ yellow _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion proteins in the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ single mutant backgrounds under the control of the authentic _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ promoters respectively . the immunoblot analysis confirmed that the _PROTEIN_ of and fusion proteins was closely comparable with that of endogenous _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in the wild type cells . consequently the serial dilution analysis with showed that the _PROTEIN_ level of was higher than that of by around to fold . the extents of and _PROTEIN_ levels in the leaf cells were consistently confirmed in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ using confocal microscopic analysis . similarly the chloroplast association of was more easily detected than that of in the intact mesophyll cells . to confirm phototropin localization on the chloroplast immunoblot analyses of protein extracts from the chloroplast fraction were performed . intact chloroplasts were isolated from week old rosette leaves of wild type and _PROTEIN_ double mutant plants . crude protein extracts from the same leaves were used as a control . both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were detected in the isolated chloroplast fractions . in several independent experiments the _PROTEIN_ band was consistently detected in the chloroplast fraction but the _PROTEIN_ band in the chloroplast fraction was consistently weak or occasionally could not be detected . collectively the _PROTEIN_ band in the chloroplast fraction was much weaker than that in the total protein fraction however the _PROTEIN_ band in the chloroplast fraction showed a similar intensity as that in the total protein fractions . to verify the fractionation we also identified some representative marker proteins in the same fractions . the well known chloroplast outer _LOCATION_ protein was enriched in the isolated chloroplast fractions from both the wild type and _PROTEIN_ mutant plants however this marker was undetectable in our total protein fractions . moreover the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ marker h _PROTEIN_ was detected in the total protein fractions but not in the isolated chloroplast fractions from the wild type and _PROTEIN_ double mutant plants indicating that the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ contamination in this isolated chloroplast fraction is not significant . _PROTEIN_ was not detected when the isolated chloroplasts were treated with the protease thermolysin and was recovered from both pelleted and soluble fractions after treatment with a hypotonic agent indicating that _PROTEIN_ was peripherally associated with the chloroplast outer _LOCATION_ . in addition _PROTEIN_ was released from the isolated chloroplasts into the soluble fraction by alkaline treatment with an alkaline buffer indicating that _PROTEIN_ is associated with the chloroplast outer _LOCATION_ via ionic interaction . collectively these results indicate that a part of phototropins is associated with the chloroplast outer _LOCATION_ . we further evaluated the amounts of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ using the isolated chloroplasts of the and transgenic plants . as expected the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ of and was clearly observed in the isolated chloroplast envelope . the immunoblot analysis further demonstrated that the amount of was larger than that of but the amounts of _PROTEIN_ detected in these lines were similar indicating that the portion of _PROTEIN_ is larger than that of _PROTEIN_ in the chloroplast fraction . because _PROTEIN_ activity on the avoidance response is dose dependent we further asked whether the amount of chloroplast associated _PROTEIN_ would be correlated to chloroplast movement . to answer this we tried to compare amounts in and lines that exhibited a correlation between _PROTEIN_ and physiological activity on the avoidance response . immunoblot analysis consistently showed that in the line was more than that in the line not only in the total and pelleted fractions but also in the chloroplast fraction . in contrast _PROTEIN_ proteins were detected at similar levels in both the total protein and chloroplast fractions between these two lines . these results suggested a correlation between the amount of _PROTEIN_ associated with chloroplasts and the magnitude of the avoidance response . the c terminal domain of _PROTEIN_ is responsible for _PROTEIN_ localization to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and the blue light dependent association of _PROTEIN_ with the _LOCATION_ apparatus . moreover the chloroplast avoidance response was defective in our transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ the c terminal deletion of _PROTEIN_ . hence it is plausible that the c terminal region of _PROTEIN_ is involved in the chloroplast localization . to assess whether the differences in the responsiveness of our transgenic plants in _METHOD_ of the avoidance response could be due to their varying affinities for the chloroplasts we examined the amounts of _PROTEIN_ in isolated chloroplasts and total crude protein extracts . although the _PROTEIN_ levels of g and nls proteins were different some amounts of these proteins were detected in all chloroplast fractions and the ratios of the amounts in the chloroplast fractions to those in the total protein fractions were not significantly changed . next we employed transient _PROTEIN_ in mesophyll protoplasts to clarify further the association of _PROTEIN_ with the chloroplast outer _LOCATION_ . the uniform _METHOD_ of _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ was observed in the chloroplast outer _LOCATION_ of the burst protoplasts . interestingly the uniform localization of in the chloroplast outer _LOCATION_ was disrupted in the c terminal deletion mutants and i.e . was in aggregates and localized near the chloroplast outer _LOCATION_ but accumulated _PROTEIN_ in the cytoplasm . furthermore _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was observed in the cell periphery and near the chloroplast outer _LOCATION_ of mesophyll cells although there was no significant phenotypic effect on _PROTEIN_ function in the line . these results suggest that the c terminal region of _PROTEIN_ is responsible for the localization pattern of _PROTEIN_ on the chloroplast outer _LOCATION_ .
the gl mutant is the parental line of the phot mutant lines and was used as the wild type control . the phot mutant lines _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and homogeneous transgenic plants were used . the plants were grown on agar plates containing half strength murashige and skoog _METHOD_ medium supplemented with sucrose . the plates were incubated in the dark at for h and subsequently transferred to a growth chamber under h periods at . the plasmids were constructed by replacing the _METHOD_ gene of with either _METHOD_ nls _METHOD_ nes _METHOD_ tap or tapi using the sali and psti restriction enzyme sites and the resulting binary vectors were named or respectively . for the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fragment was inserted into the sali and psti restriction enzyme sites of the plasmid containing the _PROTEIN_ authentic promoter region . the binary vectors were transformed into the _PROTEIN_ double mutant plants through agrobacterium mediated arabidopsis transformation . the transformed plants were selected on _METHOD_ medium containing ml kanamycin and ml cefotaxime . kanamycin resistance co segregated tightly with _METHOD_ _METHOD_ in every line . homogeneous lines were used for the experiments . intact chloroplasts were isolated as previously described with minor modifications . briefly the aerial parts of week old arabidopsis seedlings were grown on _METHOD_ medium and homogenized in a blending buffer . subsequent to filtration of the homogenate through two layers of miracloth the homogenate was centrifuged in an rotor at g and the chloroplast containing fraction was collected through the stopping and decelerating of the centrifuge immediately after the maximum speed was obtained . the pellet was resuspended in blending buffer and overlaid onto a percoll solution and centrifuged in a swing bucket rotor at g for min at . the pellet containing the intact chloroplasts was washed and resuspended in blending buffer . to digest the outer envelope proteins the isolated chloroplasts were treated with ml thermolysin for min on ice . in addition the isolated chloroplasts were treated with a hypotonic buffer or an alkaline buffer for min on ice and then fractionated into p and s fractions by centrifugation at g for min at . total protein samples were prepared from week old rosette leaves as previously described . for protein fractionation the total protein fraction was further fractionated into soluble and pelleted fractions using ultracentrifugation at g for h at as described previously . approximately of total protein and of the chloroplast samples at chl were separated using _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and then transferred onto nitrocellulose _LOCATION_ . the blots were probed with anti _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and vicia h _PROTEIN_ polyclonal antibodies respectively . changes in red light transmittance were measured to determine chloroplast photorelocation movement essentially as previously described . for microbeam irradiation confocal microscopy _METHOD_ was used to capture time lapse images . the rosette leaves of week old plants were detached and air spaces in the leaves were eliminated by gentle evacuation using a syringe that was filled with an evacuation solution . the leaves were placed into a cuvette that was composed of two round coverslips and a _PROTEIN_ shaped silicon rubber spacer . the time lapse images were taken at the indicated time intervals using nm laser scanning . during the intervals the circular area was irradiated with a strong blue light to induce the chloroplast avoidance response . the maximized images were traced using imagej software . arabidopsis mesophyll protoplasts were prepared from the rosette leaves of week old _PROTEIN_ double mutants essentially as previously described . a total of of each plasmid construct for and was transiently _PROTEIN_ in the protoplasts using polyethylene glycol mediated transformation . after incubation at for h in the dark the protoplasts were burst mechanically by pipetting and viewed under a confocal microscope _METHOD_ . the _METHOD_ was observed at nm for _METHOD_ or nm for chl _METHOD_ .
