cuticular waxes are synthesized by the extensive export of intracellular lipids from epidermal cells . however it is still not known how hydrophobic cuticular lipids are exported to the plant surface through the hydrophilic cell wall . the _PROTEIN_ gene was isolated based on arabidopsis microarray analysis this gene is predominantly _PROTEIN_ in stem epidermal peels as compared with in _METHOD_ . the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ transcripts was observed in various organs including stem epidermis and silique walls . the composition of the cuticular wax was significantly altered in the _METHOD_ and siliques of the _PROTEIN_ mutant and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant . in particular the reduced level of the _PROTEIN_ alkane which is the major component of cuticular waxes in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and siliques was similar to the sum of reduced values of either parent . the total cuticular wax load was reduced by approximately and in both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ siliques respectively and by approximately in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ when compared with the wild type . similarly severe alterations in the cuticular layer structure of epidermal cells of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and silique walls were observed . in tobacco epidermal cells intracellular trafficking of the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ was prevented by a dominant negative mutant form of adp ribosylation _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . taken together these results indicate that _PROTEIN_ is functionally overlapped with _PROTEIN_ during cuticular wax export or accumulation and _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are targeted to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ via the vesicular trafficking system .
_PROTEIN_ a homolog of _PROTEIN_ was isolated based on the mrna _PROTEIN_ pattern in microarray analysis of arabidopsis stem and stem epidermal peels and its protein structure similarity with _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ contains three different domains which correspond to a signal peptide domain a lipid transfer domain and a transmembrane domain . the signal peptide domain which was predicted to be required for protein secretion is composed of amino acid residues at the n terminal end . the lipid transfer domain contains eight highly conserved cysteine residues at positions and . finally the c terminal end was predicted to encode a transmembrane domain . according to the prediction of the potential c terminal gpi modification site the sequence position of the omega site is a serine at position . the transmembrane domain of _PROTEIN_ was predicted to be cleaved and anchored with gpi in the _LOCATION_ and then the modified _PROTEIN_ is targeted to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . to investigate whether the _PROTEIN_ gene also exhibits a higher _PROTEIN_ level in stem epidermal peels than in _METHOD_ rt pcr and quantitative real time rt pcr analyses were performed . as has been observed for _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ levels of the _PROTEIN_ transcripts were approximately fold higher in the stem epidermal peels than in the _METHOD_ . this result was consistent with the microarray results of arabidopsis stem and stem epidermal peels . to investigate the in planta role of the _PROTEIN_ gene t dna inserted _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ arabidopsis mutants were obtained from the arabidopsis biological resource center . the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ alleles contain t dna insertions in the first exon the third exon and the second intron of _GENE_ at positions and bp relative to the transcriptional initiation site respectively . no phenotypic alterations were visible during growth and development of all single mutants under normal growing conditions . to further investigate the functional relationships between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in planta double mutants were created by crossing _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ with null _PROTEIN_ . we examined the transcript levels of the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ genes in the single and double mutants . total rna was isolated from week old mature leaves of wild type single and double mutants and then subjected to rt pcr analysis . _PROTEIN_ transcripts were _PROTEIN_ in the wild type and _PROTEIN_ while the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants did not contain any detectable _PROTEIN_ transcripts . both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ transcripts were not detected in all _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant alleles . when the levels of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ transcripts in wild type _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and silique walls were analyzed by quantitative rt pcr the level of the _PROTEIN_ transcripts was increased by approximately fold in the _PROTEIN_ stem but _PROTEIN_ by approximately fold in _PROTEIN_ silique walls compared with the wild type . however the levels of _PROTEIN_ transcripts in _PROTEIN_ stem and silique walls were not significantly changed relative to the wild type level . to investigate the role of _PROTEIN_ in cuticular wax export or accumulation and its functional relationship with _PROTEIN_ the cuticular waxes extracted from the _METHOD_ siliques and leaves of the wild type and the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutants were analyzed by using gas chromatography and gc _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . the amount of _PROTEIN_ alkane the major component of cuticular waxes in the _METHOD_ and siliques was reduced in all three _PROTEIN_ knockout mutants . the amount of _PROTEIN_ alkane was _PROTEIN_ by in _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and in _PROTEIN_ siliques when compared with the wild type . the _PROTEIN_ proportion in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and siliques reflects the sum of the reduced _PROTEIN_ alkane content of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ single mutants indicating that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are functionally overlapped . no alteration in the _PROTEIN_ alkane content was observed in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ leaves . interestingly the amount of _PROTEIN_ secondary alcohol and _PROTEIN_ ketone was increased in _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and siliques but not significantly altered in _PROTEIN_ when compared with the wild type . the amount of _PROTEIN_ secondary alcohol and _PROTEIN_ ketone in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and siliques was similar to the sum of the changed value of the two single mutants . in addition the amount of _PROTEIN_ and aldehydes was not altered in _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ but was significantly reduced in _PROTEIN_ siliques by approximately and respectively when compared with the wild type . the reduced amount of _PROTEIN_ and aldehydes and _PROTEIN_ alkane in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and siliques was similar to the sum of the reduced values of the two single mutants . a similar reduction pattern in the amount of _PROTEIN_ aldehyde and primary alcohol was observed in both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ leaves . the total wax loads were reduced by approximately in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ when compared with the wild type . the total wax loads were also _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ siliques compared with in the wild type . no change in the total wax amount was observed in both the ltpg single and double mutant leaves . these results indicate that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ might play a predominant role in different organs . in the analysis of cutin monomers which are major _LOCATION_ lipid components no significant differences in the total amounts were observed between the _PROTEIN_ mutant and wild type and between the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutant and each single mutant . however the composition of cutin monomers was altered in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutants compared with the wild type . because the cuticle layer consisted of wax and cutin changes in the cuticular wax composition and content in the mutants led us to predict that changes in the structure of the cuticular layers occurred . the ultrastructure of the cuticle layer of the stem and silique epidermal cells of the wild type and the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutants was observed using transmission electron microscopy . in accordance with the previous observation in _PROTEIN_ the cuticular layers of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ stem and silique epidermal cells were disorganized and more diffused whereas the wild type cuticle was thin and continuously electron dense . the _PROTEIN_ of the cuticle layer was increased by and in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ stem epidermal cells when compared with the wild type respectively . in silique epidermal cells the diffusion of the cuticle layers was more severe and the _PROTEIN_ of the cuticle layer was fold greater in _PROTEIN_ and fold greater in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ than in the wild type . additionally unusual phenotypes such as accumulated starch and increased number of _LOCATION_ were observed in the chloroplasts of the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ silique mesocarp . according to previous reports gaps are _PROTEIN_ found in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . also _PROTEIN_ was reported to be localized to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . because _PROTEIN_ harbors the gpi anchored domain at its c terminal end we hypothesized that _PROTEIN_ is localized to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . to verify the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ the enhanced yellow _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ was inserted between the signal peptide and the _PROTEIN_ domain of the _PROTEIN_ protein and then the resulting constructs were transiently introduced into tobacco epidermal cells via an agrobacterium infiltration system . _PROTEIN_ monomeric red _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ which was used as a positive control of _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ localization was co infiltrated with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and the _METHOD_ signals were visualized under a confocal _METHOD_ microscope . as expected the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signals were perfectly merged in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . this result shows that _PROTEIN_ is also localized in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ like other gaps including _PROTEIN_ . the gaps are sorted from the _LOCATION_ to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ by an intracellular secretory pathway and vice versa by endocytic pathways . to assess the intracellular trafficking of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was co _PROTEIN_ with either the arf which plays a role in the intracellular trafficking of cargo proteins or the gdp binding dominant negative mutant form _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ which disrupts vesicular trafficking . the _METHOD_ signals from _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in the co _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ were visualized in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . the signals were present in the intracellular space in the co _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ . therefore _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ inhibited the intracellular trafficking of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ suggesting that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were targeted to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ via the vesicular trafficking system . total rna was isolated from various organs including the roots young seedlings rosette leaves cauline leaves _METHOD_ flowers and siliques and then subjected to rt pcr analysis to assess the _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ transcripts . the _PROTEIN_ transcripts were abundantly detected in all organs tested . because the total cuticular wax content was significantly reduced in siliques of the _PROTEIN_ mutant quantitative real time rt pcr was also carried out to precisely compare the spatial _PROTEIN_ level of _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ level of _PROTEIN_ transcripts was much higher in the silique walls as well as the stem epidermal peels than in other tissues . when the levels of the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ transcripts were compared in the silique walls they were found to be similar . the amount of cuticular wax was shown to be increased by treatment with salt and drought stresses . in order to evaluate whether the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ is regulated by abiotic stresses and abscisic acid day old seedlings were incubated in murashige and skoog _METHOD_ medium supplemented with mm nacl mm mannitol or aba or exposed to dehydration stress . the _PROTEIN_ gene which is known to be a drought stress inducible gene was used as a control for the water deficit response . _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ gene increased significantly in response to the treatments whereas the level of the _PROTEIN_ transcripts was not affected by salt and dehydration stresses or aba . the spatial and temporal _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ gene was further evaluated by introducing the d _PROTEIN_ gene under the control of the _PROTEIN_ promoter into arabidopsis . various organs from five independent transgenic lines were then stained for gus _PROTEIN_ . strong gus activity was observed in the aerial portions and root tips of the day old seedlings . when the stem and leaf tissues were cross sectioned the gus gene was found to be _PROTEIN_ in the stem and leaf epidermis including the trichomes leaf mesophyll cells and stem cortex and xylem . in addition gus _PROTEIN_ was observed in the upper portion of the styles anther filament and veins of the sepals and _PROTEIN_ . furthermore the silique walls and developing seeds were strongly stained .
