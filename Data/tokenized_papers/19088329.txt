_LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ repair in animal cells uses synaptotagmin a activated _LOCATION_ fusion protein that mediates delivery of intracellular _LOCATION_ to wound sites by a mechanism resembling neuronal regulated exocytosis . here we show that loss of function of the homologous arabidopsis thaliana synaptotagmin protein _PROTEIN_ reduces the viability of cells as a consequence of a _PROTEIN_ in the integrity of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . this reduced integrity is enhanced in the _PROTEIN_ null mutant in conditions of osmotic stress likely caused by a defective _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ repair . consistent with a role in _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ repair _PROTEIN_ is ubiquitously _PROTEIN_ is located at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and shares all domains characteristic of animal synaptotagmins _PROTEIN_ . our analyses support that _LOCATION_ trafficking mediated by _PROTEIN_ is important for _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ integrity and plant fitness .
to identify genes essential for nacl tolerance we performed a forward genetic screen in an arabidopsis t dna insertion mutant population for plants hypersensitive to the presence of mm nacl . as a result we isolated a t dna insertion line in the arabidopsis ecotype _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ that showed hypersensitivity to nacl . as shown in figure wild type and _PROTEIN_ seedlings showed similar growth under control conditions . however upon exposure to mm nacl roots of wild type seedlings grew slowly while _PROTEIN_ root growth was inhibited even more . the genomic dna flanking the left border of the t dna in _PROTEIN_ was amplified by thermal asymmetric interlaced pcr as described previously revealing that the insertion was located in the untranslated region bp upstream the _PROTEIN_ translation start site of the _GENE_ gene . the gene contains exons and introns and was named _PROTEIN_ because it encodes a protein with similar structure to animal synaptotagmins . a homology search of _PROTEIN_ against the human protein reference database showed as the protein with the highest homology . is located in the _LOCATION_ of lysosomes and some nonsynaptic secretory granules where it regulates triggered exocytosis and _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ repair . to confirm that _PROTEIN_ was required for nacl tolerance we isolated an arabidopsis mutant from the sail collection _PROTEIN_ with the t dna located in the exon of _GENE_ . this t dna line also showed hypersensitivity when growing at high nacl . we did not detect _PROTEIN_ transcripts by rt pcr in the _PROTEIN_ mutant and consistent with _PROTEIN_ being a null allele _PROTEIN_ protein was not detected in protein gel blots of microsomal fractions isolated from _PROTEIN_ homozygous lines . because segregation and dna gel blot analysis indicated that _PROTEIN_ contained several t dna insertions we decided to use the columbia _PROTEIN_ mutant allele for further studies . comparison of the hypersensitive phenotype of _PROTEIN_ to that of a complementing line transformed with the genomic fragment containing the _PROTEIN_ gene fully demonstrated that the nacl hypersensitive phenotype was due to a lesion in the _PROTEIN_ gene . to analyze _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ we first compiled data using the genevestigator database . _PROTEIN_ shows a constitutive _PROTEIN_ in all tissues analyzed and its _PROTEIN_ is little affected by any of the _PROTEIN_ reported in the database . rt pcr experiments using rna extracted from roots shoots rosette and cauline leaves inflorescences and siliques also suggested a ubiquitous _PROTEIN_ for _PROTEIN_ . to investigate the in planta _PROTEIN_ patterns of _PROTEIN_ we generated transgenic lines containing a fused _PROTEIN_ gene under control of the _PROTEIN_ cis regulatory sequences located upstream the open reading frame . the gus _PROTEIN_ patterns of several independent lines analyzed were very similar and figure shows the results for a representative line . in roots of d old seedlings all cells showed _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ . strong _PROTEIN_ was found in the vascular tissue of the elongation zone and cells of the root cap . in week old plants _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ in most tissues . it was strongly _PROTEIN_ in the vascular tissue and epidermal cells of cotelydons and leaves . _PROTEIN_ was also highly _PROTEIN_ in trichomes and the root system . in inflorescence gus activity was observed in most tissues of inflorescence _METHOD_ sepals and stamen filaments . these results of gus activity are in agreement with the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ determined by rt pcr and the genevestigator database . to provide clues to _PROTEIN_ function we next investigated its subcellular localization . we used different strategies including analysis of transient nicotiana tabacum and stable arabidopsis lines transformed with a _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ construct as well as immunolocalization using anti _PROTEIN_ antibodies . in leaf cells of transiently transformed tobacco _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ localizes to _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ domains resembling elements of cortical _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . a similar pattern of _PROTEIN_ was observed in control _METHOD_ _LOCATION_ cells highlighting the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ tubules like _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ but lacking the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ positive stable spots at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . we also determined that the predicted transmembrane domain has an essential role in anchoring _PROTEIN_ to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ because a transiently _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein lacking this domain is localized in the _LOCATION_ and inside the _LOCATION_ . localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ is observed at distinct patches of cell periphery organizing hechtian strands which interconnect cell wall with the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ after plasmolysis . this pattern was identical in cells of the lower epidermis of leaves and in epidermal cells at the root hair zone in stable transformed arabidopsis . at the root apex there was high _PROTEIN_ with abundant _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and cell periphery localization of _PROTEIN_ in root cap cells . subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ was also analyzed using the anti _PROTEIN_ specific antibodies previously used in protein gel blot analysis . as a control we used preimmune serum indicating that the signal is specific for _PROTEIN_ . localization of _PROTEIN_ in a cross section of a root apex corroborates that the _PROTEIN_ signal is associated with the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . especially strong _PROTEIN_ positive signals were found at the cross walls of the transition zone of the root apex which accomplishes a high rate of endocytosis and vesicle trafficking . in the shoot apex and cotyledons there is an even distribution of _PROTEIN_ at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . immunogold electron microscopy confirmed localization of the _PROTEIN_ at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . young cell walls showed more abundant decoration of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ with _PROTEIN_ and there is also abundant localization of _PROTEIN_ within plasmodesmata . our data indicate that _PROTEIN_ localizes preferentially to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . these results are also consistent with two previous proteomics reports that identified _PROTEIN_ in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ using _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . all synaptotagmins are composed of an n terminal transmembrane region a central linker sequence and two c terminal _PROTEIN_ domains . the dependent binding to phospholipid _LOCATION_ is the best characterized function of _PROTEIN_ domains . the two _PROTEIN_ domains of synaptotagmins _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ have an independently folding compact b sandwich structure formed by two four stranded sheets with flexible loops at the top and the bottom . the conserved acidic residues in these loops thought to play crucial roles in coordinating ions are also conserved in the _PROTEIN_ domain of _PROTEIN_ but not in the _PROTEIN_ domain . nevertheless analyses of animal synaptotagmins indicate that and phospholipid binding properties can not be reliably predicted from sequence analysis alone . therefore we studied whether the _PROTEIN_ domains of arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ are capable of forming dependent complexes with negatively charged liposomes . for this purpose we used a centrifugation assay that monitors dependent phospholipid binding of _PROTEIN_ domains to liposomes . recombinant _PROTEIN_ fragments of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ from rat _PROTEIN_ were purified as glutathione s transferase _PROTEIN_ fusion proteins and incubated with liposomes in the presence of different concentrations of free . after isolation liposome bound proteins were analyzed using _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ blue staining . because we could not predict the length of _PROTEIN_ domain required for phospholipid binding we generated constructs with various n terminal extensions in the _PROTEIN_ domain . all _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ peptides were capable of binding phospholipids in a dependent manner . unexpectedly a marked independent binding of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ to liposomes was observed . the binding properties of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ differed from those of the single domains and behaved as a mix of the individual _PROTEIN_ domains . to be physiologically significant phospholipid binding to _PROTEIN_ should be stimulated by concentrations similar to those achieved in planta . we calculated a half maximal binding of free for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ similar to the we determined for rat _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ a value previously reported for rat _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . the half maximum binding of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was to indicating cooperativity between the _PROTEIN_ domains for and phospholipid binding as also reported for neuronal _PROTEIN_ . we identified _PROTEIN_ by its hypersensitivity to high nacl . we then performed a detailed physiological analysis of _PROTEIN_ responses to nacl . because _PROTEIN_ shows homology to animal sensors and presents dependent phospholipid binding activity nacl responses were determined in the presence of low and high in the medium . _PROTEIN_ seedlings already showed a reduced growth compared with the wild type in control conditions . however growth inhibition of _PROTEIN_ was enhanced upon nacl treatment relative to the wild type . the presence of low increased the sensitivity of wild type and _PROTEIN_ seedlings to nacl . at low and mm nacl the _PROTEIN_ root of wild type seedlings resumed its growth while _PROTEIN_ root growth was arrested . however at high growth arrest of _PROTEIN_ roots occurred at mm nacl . this was quantified by fresh weight measurements of seedlings after nacl treatments . with the exception of mm nacl significant differences in fresh weight between wild type and _PROTEIN_ seedlings were found at all concentrations analyzed with the highest differences occurring at mm nacl . in animals plays an essential role in _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ repair . therefore we speculated that loss of function of _PROTEIN_ would have a defective _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ repair mechanism resulting in the loss of _LOCATION_ integrity . we then determined electrolyte leakage to quantify the extent of _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ damage caused by increasing nacl concentrations at high and low concentrations . when growing in medium without nacl and high a higher percentage of electrolytes was lost from _PROTEIN_ seedlings compared with the wild type indicating a reduced integrity of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ of _PROTEIN_ even in standard conditions . this reduced _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ integrity is comparable to that recently reported for the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ mutant affected in dolichol synthesis and abiotic stress tolerance . upon nacl treatments more electrolytes were lost from _PROTEIN_ plants with the highest difference at mm nacl . the _PROTEIN_ of _LOCATION_ in the medium caused a general _PROTEIN_ in _LOCATION_ integrity of both _PROTEIN_ and wild type seedlings at all conditions analyzed . a time course analysis using mm nacl indicated that at h there was an important difference in electrolyte leakage between _PROTEIN_ plants and the wild type . these differences between _PROTEIN_ and wild type seedlings persisted at and h of nacl stress and were attenuated after h of treatment . if _PROTEIN_ plays a role in _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ integrity we hypothesized that other conditions that result in _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ stress such as osmotic shock or freezing would produce an increased sensitivity of _PROTEIN_ plants . we treated _PROTEIN_ and wild type seedlings with polyethylene glycol to mimic drought stress as described previously . under control or peg treatment there was a small difference in the percentage of electrolyte leakage between wild type and _PROTEIN_ plants . however at peg significantly more electrolytes were lost from _PROTEIN_ seedlings than from the wild type . we then investigated if the reduced _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ integrity of _PROTEIN_ was dependent on the tissue analyzed . as shown in figure both root and shoots showed higher electrolyte leakage in _PROTEIN_ than in the wild type after peg treatment consistent with the ubiquitous _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ gene . _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ integrity of _PROTEIN_ and wild type seedlings after freezing was then analyzed . as shown in supplemental figure online _PROTEIN_ seedlings showed lower _LOCATION_ integrity than the wild type at control and subfreezing temperatures however these differences became apparent after freezing . overall we demonstrate that _PROTEIN_ seedlings present reduced _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ integrity with respect to the wild type in control conditions that are enhanced under stress . electrolyte leakage experiments indicate that both roots and shoots of _PROTEIN_ have reduced _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ integrity . therefore we studied _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ integrity in vivo at cellular level using arabidopsis roots as this organ allows easy monitoring of cell _LOCATION_ using confocal microscopy . we used the _METHOD_ dye a well established endocytic marker . it inserts into the lipid bilayer and labels the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . subsequently it is taken up into the cell interior via endocytosis and gradually labels the entire endosomal network . _METHOD_ of a cell with a wounded _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ after stress will increase many fold owing to an unrestricted influx of the dye and a _METHOD_ staining of the endomembrane network . this was tested in root cells following physical damage of arabidopsis seedlings and further confirmed by the use of double labeling with fluorescein diacetate _PROTEIN_ and that distinguishes live from dead cells . for these experiments we used d old seedlings with a single root for reproducibility . we first investigated the effect of increasing concentrations of nacl in _LOCATION_ integrity after h in wild type and _PROTEIN_ roots . because we have shown that low enhances the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ damage we performed these experiments using low concentration . at control conditions and up to mm nacl no _LOCATION_ damage was found in either wild type or _PROTEIN_ roots . at mm nacl a few cells in _PROTEIN_ were completely stained with indicating disruption of their _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . the number of cells with damaged _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ in _PROTEIN_ increased at higher concentrations of nacl . at mm nacl while most cells were alive in wild type roots in _PROTEIN_ only those cells located at the root tip were viable indicating that the sensitivity of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ was dependent on the cell type . the use of double labeling with _PROTEIN_ and in these conditions further allowed us to clearly distinguish live from dead cells . we next analyzed _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ integrity during a time course experiment using mm nacl . we used this high nacl concentration because it allows a continuous monitoring of _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ damage of wild type cells within a workable period of time . in control conditions all cells from wild type and _PROTEIN_ roots showed intact _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . after min all cells from the elongation region of _PROTEIN_ showed damaged _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ while only a few cells of wild type roots were fully stained . in _PROTEIN_ as early as s after the onset of the nacl stress we could observe lack of integrity of epidermal cells in _PROTEIN_ plants indicating that this process occurs very rapidly and locally at the site of stress imposition . after min in contrast with the wild type all cells in _PROTEIN_ including meristematic cells showed full staining indicative of total loss of viability . to analyze at the cellular level the phenotype observed in conditions in which _PROTEIN_ and the wild type presented the _PROTEIN_ physiological differences we studied _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ integrity of seedlings after d of mm nacl treatment . whereas the _PROTEIN_ roots of _PROTEIN_ show very limited growth at mm nacl and low wild type roots were able to resume their growth . staining showed that all cells in _PROTEIN_ roots were damaged explaining their growth arrest . interestingly most cells originated in wild type roots after being transferred to nacl _PROTEIN_ showed intact _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ in contrast with those cells originated prior to the transfer to nacl . the most likely explanation is that meristematic cells of wild type roots survive the nacl shock and the newly formed cells are able to increase their _LOCATION_ stability by _PROTEIN_ to the high nacl conditions thereby allowing root growth . as we did previously for ion leakage measurements we analyzed other osmotic agents to further demonstrate that the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ sensitivity of _PROTEIN_ is caused by the osmotic component of nacl . under control peg and peg treatment no differences were found in wild type and _PROTEIN_ roots . however at peg while most cells of wild type roots showed intact _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ cells from the elongation region of _PROTEIN_ showed damaged _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . similar results to those obtained using nacl were observed when kcl was used as an osmotic agent . we next investigated whether the loss of _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ viability is a general outcome of mutants that are affected in abiotic stress tolerance . for this purpose we used the previously identified _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ arabidopsis mutants . _PROTEIN_ shows hypersensitivity to nacl and the affected gene encodes a _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ na /h antiporter . _PROTEIN_ shows reduced osmotic stress tolerance as a consequence of a mutation in a syntaxin gene . as shown in supplemental figure online roots of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ show similar _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ sensitivity to their respective wild type after being exposed to nacl stress . taken together these data indicate that reduced _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ viability is not a general feature of abiotic stress hypersensitivity mutants .
