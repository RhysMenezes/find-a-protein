the point of attachment of spindle microtubules to metaphase chromosomes is known as the centromere . plant and animal centromeres are epigenetically specified by a centromere specific variant of histone _PROTEIN_ . unlike canonical histones that are invariant _PROTEIN_ proteins are accumulating substitutions at an accelerated rate . this diversification of _PROTEIN_ is a conundrum since its role as the key determinant of centromere identity remains a constant across species . here we ask whether naturally occurring divergence in _PROTEIN_ has functional consequences . we performed functional complementation assays on _PROTEIN_ a null mutation in arabidopsis thaliana using untagged _PROTEIN_ from increasingly distant relatives . contrary to previous results using _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ we find that the essential functions of _PROTEIN_ are conserved across a broad evolutionary landscape . _PROTEIN_ from a species as distant as the monocot zea mays can functionally replace a. thaliana _PROTEIN_ . plants _PROTEIN_ variant _PROTEIN_ that are fertile when selfed show dramatic segregation _LOCATION_ when crossed to a wild type individual . the progeny of this cross include hybrid diploids aneuploids with novel genetic rearrangements and haploids that inherit only the genome of the wild type parent . importantly it is always chromosomes from the plant _PROTEIN_ the divergent _PROTEIN_ that missegregate . using chimeras we show that it is divergence in the fast evolving n terminal tail of _PROTEIN_ that is causing segregation _LOCATION_ and genome elimination . furthermore we analyzed n terminal tail sequences from plant _PROTEIN_ and discovered a modular pattern of sequence conservation . from this we hypothesize that while the essential functions of _PROTEIN_ are largely conserved the n terminal tail is evolving to _PROTEIN_ to lineage specific centromeric constraints . our results demonstrate that this lineage specific evolution of _PROTEIN_ causes inviability and sterility of progeny in crosses at the same time producing karyotypic variation . thus _PROTEIN_ evolution can contribute to postzygotic reproductive barriers .
a. thaliana is a member of the mustard family known for its agriculturally important brassica crops . analysis of _PROTEIN_ homologs from several species within the mustard family revealed that it is _PROTEIN_ evolving both at the histone fold domain and the n terminal tail _PROTEIN_ . ravi et al . had assayed _PROTEIN_ from species within the brassicaceae and beyond for functional complementation of _PROTEIN_ a _PROTEIN_ null mutation in a. thaliana . they found that _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ from brassica rapa and zea mays localized at a. thaliana centromeres but only _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ from the closely related species a. arenosa rescued embryo lethality of the _PROTEIN_ . a caveat to these experiments was the presence of the _METHOD_ tag . _METHOD_ tagged a. thaliana _PROTEIN_ largely complemented the functions of the a. thaliana _PROTEIN_ mutation but when crossed to wild type segregation _LOCATION_ were observed at a low frequency . this hinted that the _METHOD_ tag is not entirely neutral . thus to assay only the effects of naturally evolved variation on _PROTEIN_ function we decided to test complementation of the _PROTEIN_ null mutant using native untagged proteins . we chose _PROTEIN_ from b. rapa and lepidium oleraceum two species nested within the brassicaceae family . l. oleraceum is more closely related to a. thaliana than b. rapa but more distantly than a. arenosa . to test for complementation we transformed _PROTEIN_ heterozygotes with constructs _PROTEIN_ genomic sequence encoding l. oleraceum _PROTEIN_ and b. rapa _PROTEIN_ under the endogenous a. thaliana _PROTEIN_ promoter . we recovered transformants that were homozygous for the _PROTEIN_ mutation for both variants in the generation . this result is revealing in two ways firstly it shows that the _METHOD_ tag interferes with _PROTEIN_ function and secondly it indicates that the previously defined boundary of functional complementation is incorrect . we further characterized the extent of mitotic and meiotic complementation in the generation . a. thaliana plants homozygous for _PROTEIN_ null mutation _PROTEIN_ transgenic l. oleraceum _PROTEIN_ or b. rapa _PROTEIN_ were phenotypically indistinguishable from wild type . we therefore conclude that b. rapa and l. oleraceum _PROTEIN_ can fully complement a. thaliana _PROTEIN_ mitotic functions required for vegetative growth . transgenic lines for both _PROTEIN_ variants in a _PROTEIN_ homozygous background were also self fertile . plants at rosette stage from different complemented lines compared to wild type columbia and _METHOD_ tailswap a high frequency haploid inducer . the genotype of the endogenous _PROTEIN_ locus is indicated in parentheses . is l. oleraceum _PROTEIN_ and is b. rapa _PROTEIN_ . atntt lohfd and lontt athfd are chimeric _PROTEIN_ described in the key . anthers stained for viability with alexander stain . viable pollen granules stain purple . measures of fertility based on number of seeds per silique and seed appearance . bars in different shades of grey represent counts from different lines . for each measurement seeds from siliques were pooled and counted . to assay meiotic complementation we wanted to identify plants that were homozygous for both the _PROTEIN_ null mutation and variant _PROTEIN_ transgene . following segregation ratios of the transgene is not informative in a _PROTEIN_ homozygous mutant background since individuals without transgenic _PROTEIN_ can not survive . therefore we decided to use frequency of seed death in selfed siliques of plants to infer the zygosity of the _PROTEIN_ transgene . individuals that are _PROTEIN_ / and heterozygous for the transgene are expected to produce seed death upon selfing . assuming that the transgene is inserted at a single locus individuals homozygous for the transgene are expected to produce to less than seed death if fully or partially complementing the meiotic functions of the endogenous a. thaliana _PROTEIN_ . using this criterion to infer the zygosity of the transgene we measured fertility of a. thaliana plants in which the endogenous _PROTEIN_ is replaced by l. oleraceum _PROTEIN_ or b. rapa _PROTEIN_ . we measured seed set and frequency of abnormal seeds in selfed siliques from three independent transformation events for each construct . the complemented lines were comparable to wild type for both measures of fertility . furthermore viability stained anthers from the same complemented lines showed live pollen numbers and appearance indistinguishable from wild type . for l. oleraceum _PROTEIN_ complemented lines we further analysed meiosis cytologically with dapi stained chromosome spreads from pollen mother cells in two families and . prophase i of meiosis in both lines was indistinguishable from wild type . chromosome segregation in pmcs at both meiotic divisions was checked for segregation _LOCATION_ . in the family metaphase i anaphase i metaphase ii anaphase ii and telophase ii pmcs were scored none of which displayed segregation _LOCATION_ . careful inspection of all post prophase i pmcs sampled revealed some limited chromosome fragmentation in one anaphase ii cell . although the origin of this can not be ascertained at present its low frequency is unlikely to compromise fertility . thus we conclude that _PROTEIN_ orthologs can complement the essential mitotic and meiotic functions of a. thaliana _PROTEIN_ under standard growing conditions . male meiotic chromosome spreads stained with dapi for wt col and l. oleraceum _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . scale bar . next we wanted to test how a. thaliana centromeres built on _PROTEIN_ variants functioned in comparison to those built on the native a. thaliana _PROTEIN_ . to do so we crossed them as females with pollen from wild type _PROTEIN_ landsberg _LOCATION_ homozygous for the glabrous mutation which confers a trichomeless phenotype . we chose ler as the _PROTEIN_ wild type parent because the complemented lines were generated in the col accession . this allows us to use _METHOD_ between col and ler to determine the parent of origin for all the chromosomes in the . in a standard cross we expect only diploid hybrids with trichomes . however if replacing the endogenous _PROTEIN_ with natural variants creates weak centromeres then we can expect mitotic missegregation in the zygote . the first indication of abnormal segregation in these crosses was the observation that seeds aborted during development . in contrast to the uniformly tan colored plump seeds generated when the complemented lines are selfed dark nearly black shriveled seeds were seen in crosses to wild type . upon germination of seeds from l. oleraceum _PROTEIN_ and b. rapa _PROTEIN_ crosses we recovered diploid aneuploid and haploid progeny . all haploids were sterile and paternal on the basis of having a trichomeless appearance an _PROTEIN_ of the recessive mutation . we confirmed the haploid genome content of phenotypically selected haploids by flow cytometry . crosses were between _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ transgene females and pollen from wild type landsberg _PROTEIN_ / strain homozygous for the glabrous mutation . sterile offspring _PROTEIN_ the recessive trichomeless phenotype were scored as paternal haploid . offspring with developmental defects were scored as aneuploid . fertile wild type offspring were scored as diploid . for each _PROTEIN_ construct we tested two individuals from each of the three independent transformation events in crosses to wild type ler . substantial variation in the frequency of haploids was observed between the different families . while the source of this variability is unclear it is consistent with the variable haploid induction rates observed when _METHOD_ tailswap is crossed to wild type . in cases where _PROTEIN_ is complemented with l. oleraceum _PROTEIN_ the frequency of genome elimination ranged from to . for b. rapa _PROTEIN_ complemented _PROTEIN_ the range was to . although l. oleraceum is more closely related to a. thaliana than b. rapa substituting endogenous a. thaliana _PROTEIN_ with the l. oleraceum ortholog in an a. thaliana plant appeared to have a greater destabilizing effect on a. thaliana centromere as inferred from the larger frequency of genome elimination on average . we have not observed any instances of aneuploidy and haploidy in the selfed progeny of the complemented lines . in addition meiosis in l. oleraceum families and which generated the highest frequency of haploids and aneuploids is wild type in appearance . from the absence of meiotic defects during selfing we infer that the segregation _LOCATION_ and genome elimination observed in the crosses to wild type _PROTEIN_ are not the byproduct of meiotic dysfunction in the inducer parent but rather the consequences of postzygotic interactions in the hybrid embryo . from this we conclude that natural variation in _PROTEIN_ can cause centromere mediated genome elimination and contribute to genetic instability through changes in ploidy . one of the hallmarks of centromere mediated genome elimination is the generation of aneuploid progeny at a relatively high frequency _METHOD_ . aneuploids have imbalanced karyotypes that perturb gene dosage with large and variable phenotypic consequences . a. thaliana aneuploids exhibit morphological phenotypes in a wide variety of traits including abnormal leaf morphology irregular branching patterns and infertility . using these criteria we estimated that in crosses of ler to l. oleraceum _PROTEIN_ and b. rapa _PROTEIN_ complemented lines the incidence of aneuploidy is and respectively . we selected phenotypically aneuploid progeny from each cross for whole genome sequencing to determine the relative dosage of each chromosome using a bioinformatics approach . chromosomes and subchromosomal regions that vary from the expected number of can be readily identified by increased or _PROTEIN_ read count relative to the rest of the genome . we identified chromosomal imbalances in of the individuals selected for sequencing . in this dataset we found three classes of aneuploid chromosome types and an example of each is shown in . as a comparison diploid col/ler individual with copies of each of the five a. thaliana chromosome is shown in . the first class contains numerical aneuploids where whole chromosomes are duplicated as exemplified by an individual trisomic for _PROTEIN_ . the second class contains aneuploids with truncated chromosomes such as for example an extra copy of _PROTEIN_ with a truncated left arm . lastly the third class displays dosage variation consistent with chromosomes that shattered and have gained or lost dna segments multiple times across the entire length of the chromosome . an example for a shattered _PROTEIN_ is shown in . based on our low pass sequencing analysis we can not infer the chromosomal organization of these dosage variants presented here . shown here are pictures of an individual plant alongside its bin dosage plot and mb bin snp analysis across all five chromosomes . the red boxes indicate their relative centromere positions . a diploid col hybrid individual from a genome elimination cross mediated by . the three major aneuploid types represented by examples of each an individual with a numerical aneuploid chromosome a truncated aneuploid chromosome and a shattered aneuploid chromosome . percentage of each type of chromosomal variants of the aneuploids derived from a and genome elimination cross . using snps between the parental lines we were able to infer the origins of the copy variant regions . in all three classes of dosage variants the dna contributing to the increased copy number originated from the transgenic col parent in which the endogenous _PROTEIN_ had been replaced by an evolutionary variant . we even observed the loss of heterozygosity in the shattered _PROTEIN_ as a result of the complete loss of the col chromosomal regions . the largest fractions of aneuploids from these crosses were products of whole chromosome missegregation events . however there were also a considerable number of aneuploids with sub chromosomal changes in copy number . this variation in dosage implies the creation of novel genetic karyotypes . in summary centromeres built on _PROTEIN_ variants appear to missegregate in crosses to wild type . one consequence of which is aneuploidy and segmental dosage variants and with that the introduction of a broad range of phenotypic diversity . since our results negated the previously identified limits of _PROTEIN_ functional complementation we decided to sample a larger evolutionary space . flowering plants are divided into two major groups monocots and dicots that diverged from each other mya . rosids are the largest clade within the dicots comprising of around species including the model plant a. thaliana . to better understand the extent of variation in _PROTEIN_ across the plant kingdom we collated _PROTEIN_ sequences from public databases that included homologs from green algae mosses monocots and dicots . using protein sequence from the hfd we generated a multiple sequence alignment and constructed a phylogeny of _PROTEIN_ in the plant kingdom . this _PROTEIN_ hfd based gene tree was largely congruent with the accepted evolutionary relationships between these species . the most striking feature of the tree is the size of its branches and the variation in their lengths illustrating the rapid and variable rates of _PROTEIN_ evolution . we chose to test _PROTEIN_ from two additional species at increasing degrees of evolutionary distance from a. thaliana grapevine one of the earliest diverging rosid species considered a basal rosid and corn a monocot . phylogenetic tree inferred by using the maximum likelihood method based on the jtt _PROTEIN_ based model . the tree with the highest log likelihood is shown . the tree is drawn to scale with branch lengths measured in the number of substitutions per site . summary of complementation tests of a. thaliana _PROTEIN_ mutation with _PROTEIN_ from increasingly distant plant species . to test the functional complementation of these distant species we made constructs _PROTEIN_ v. vinifera _PROTEIN_ and z. mays _PROTEIN_ cdna under control of the endogenous a. thaliana _PROTEIN_ promoter . these transgenes were transformed into _PROTEIN_ heterozygotes . we recovered both v. vinifera _PROTEIN_ and z. mays _PROTEIN_ transformants in a _PROTEIN_ homozygous background in the generation . v. vinifera and z. mays _PROTEIN_ have and amino acid substitutions respectively relative to the amino acid positions in the hfd of a. thaliana _PROTEIN_ . hence it was surprising that both v. vinifera _PROTEIN_ and z. mays _PROTEIN_ were able to complement the embryo lethality of the _PROTEIN_ resulting in plants undistinguishable from the wild type . to the extent that the complemented lines were self fertile we can say that both variants also fulfilled the essential meiotic functions of a. thaliana _PROTEIN_ . the l. oleraceum _PROTEIN_ gene has amino acid substitutions in its hfd relative to a. thaliana and in its n terminal tail . we generated chimeric proteins in which the n terminal tail of l. oleraceum _PROTEIN_ was fused to the hfd of a. thaliana _PROTEIN_ and vice versa . we assayed complementation of _PROTEIN_ and found that both chimeras complemented the embryo lethality of the _PROTEIN_ mutation in the generation . the chimeric _PROTEIN_ were also similar to wild type with respect to pollen viability as determined by viability staining and in number and appearance of developing seeds within siliques . we then tested the functionality of centromeres built on these chimeric _PROTEIN_ transgenes by making crosses to wild type . it was immediately apparent by visual inspection of the resulting seeds that the two chimeras had entirely different effects . the seeds from the chimera with a. thaliana n terminal tail fused to l. oleraceum hfd crossed to wild type appeared largely normal while most of the seeds from the l. oleraceum n terminal tail fused to a. thaliana hfd were abnormal in appearance . we failed to obtain seed germination from crosses of lontt athfd to the wild type except from a single family . in this respect the function of the chimera lontt athfd is reduced compared to the full length l. oleraceum _PROTEIN_ . we only recovered progeny from the lontt athfd cross of which were haploids and were phenotypically aneuploid . in contrast we recovered a large number of progeny from the crosses with atntt lohfd . however out of a total of s none were haploids . this indicates that restoring the n terminal tail to the endogenous sequence is sufficient to restore activity to a level similar to wild type . since our genetic assays highlight a critical role of the n terminal tail sequence in segregation and genome elimination we were interested in identifying patterns in its sequence evolution . n terminal tails of _PROTEIN_ proteins are hyper variable both in their amino acid sequence and length ranging from amino acids to amino acids . thus reconstructing the evolutionary history of n terminal tails from alignments of distant _PROTEIN_ lineages is not possible . instead we decided to use an alignment free approach and used the motif search program meme to identify short conserved blocks of sequence homology in the otherwise unstructured n terminal tail . a similar approach investigating n terminal tail evolution in drosophila species identified three conserved blocks of homology shared by all _PROTEIN_ alleles in that clade . our analysis of n terminal tails includes variation from a significantly broader evolutionary timescale with _PROTEIN_ sequences ranging from green algae to flowering plants . we identified seven stretches of conserved protein sequences which we have termed blocks . the over representation of brassicaceae clade specific motifs is a reflection of our sampling bias in which of the n terminal tail sequences were from species within the brassicaceae . schematic representation of _PROTEIN_ n terminal tails from a subset of plant species in the context of their known phylogenetic relationships . motifs identified by meme are represented as different colored blocks . n terminal tails are drawn to scale with the relative locations of each motif identified . the height of the motif block is proportional to log . motif blocks and in logos format . all instances where the motifs were identified are included below for comparison . several interesting patterns were immediately apparent first block and block were identified in nearly all plant _PROTEIN_ and in canonical histone . it appears that while the intervening sequence is highly variable in both length and content the n and c terminus of n terminal tails are evolving under strict constraint . these blocks were not identified in h. sapiens _PROTEIN_ . second in several instances where a species genome carries two copies of _PROTEIN_ there was differential retention of blocks between the two copies a situation analogous to sub functionalization post gene duplication . for example copy a of _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis lyrata is missing block but retained block while copy b is missing block but has retained block . in hordeum vulgare the monocot specific block is retained in copy a but lost in copy b . third isolated blocks were identified across long evolutionary distances . for example brassicaceae specific block was absent in all other lineages but present in v. vinifera a basal rosid . similarly block that is present in most but not all brassicaceae species was also identified in two distant rosid species phaseolus vulgaris and glycine max . the most parsimonious explanation for this pattern is that sequences homologous to block and block were present in the n terminal tail of the ancestral _PROTEIN_ and were selectively retained or lost in the different rosid species . these observations suggest a modular evolutionary pattern where the constraints on individual blocks are independent of one another . an outcome of this might be that the n terminal tails acquire lineage specific configuration of blocks thereby generating combinatorial sequence diversity .
plants were transformed by the agrobacterium floral dip method using standard protocols . plants were grown under hr of hr of dark at . for each cross at least five flowers from an early inflorescence were emasculated and pollinated one day _PROTEIN_ with wild type pollen . seeds were first sown in _METHOD_ plates containing sucrose to maximize germination efficiency and then transplanted to soil . the l. oleracem _PROTEIN_ coding region including introns was pcr amplified from genomic dna with the addition of sali and xbai sites at the ends . this pcr product was then cloned using standard restriction enzyme cloning into _PROTEIN_ a cassette vector generated by ravi et al . . this vector is based on and carries the endogenous a. thaliana _PROTEIN_ promoter region i.e . bp upstream of the _PROTEIN_ followed by a small linker region containing sali and xbai sites and finally the _PROTEIN_ transcriptional terminator i.e . bp downstream of the _PROTEIN_ codon . all other constructs were cloned into a new gateway compatible cassette vector that was derived from the above _PROTEIN_ . to construct this vector we used three fragment multi site gateway technology that allows simultaneous assembly of three dna fragments in a defined order into a destination vector . the first and third fragments are the endogenous a. thaliana _PROTEIN_ promoter and terminator respectively while the second fragment can be any _PROTEIN_ variant being tested . we pcr amplified the promoter and terminator sequences from _PROTEIN_ flanked by the appropriate attb sites and recombined them via the _PROTEIN_ reaction into pdonr and pdonr respectively generating the following entry clones pentr promoter and pentr terminator . next we integrated these two along with pentr plac spec the control entry clone for the second fragment into the destination vector through a single lr reaction . the destination vector was a generous gift from the pikaard lab and was a modified binary vector that has an additional ampicillin resistance gene for bacterial selection . we then did a reverse _PROTEIN_ reaction with this intermediate _PROTEIN_ plasmid and pdonr to replace the placeholder in the second fragment with the gateway negative selection cassette generating the final cassette vector _PROTEIN_ promoter cmr ccdb terminator in . the b. rapa _PROTEIN_ genomic sequence was pcr amplified from the _METHOD_ tagged b. rapa _PROTEIN_ plasmid generated in ravi et al . a chimeric transgene combining the a. thaliana n terminal tail domain with l. oleraceum hfd was constructed by overlapping pcr . the n terminal domain included genomic sequence coding for _PROTEIN_ starting from the _PROTEIN_ up to but not including the pgtval motif and the hfd extended from the pgtval motif to the _PROTEIN_ codon . the reciprocal construct with l. oleraceum n terminal tail domain and a. thaliana hfd was similarly constructed . transgenic variants outside the brassicaceae were generated using _PROTEIN_ cdna . z. mays _PROTEIN_ was pcr amplified from plasmid generated in ravi et al . _PROTEIN_ cdna from v. vinifera was synthesized by genscript usa inc. piscataway nj based on the genbank sequence . genomic dna preparation and pcr genotyping were performed using standard methods . _PROTEIN_ was genotyped with dcaps primers . to genotype the _PROTEIN_ mutation in lines with the construct a. thaliana n terminal tail domain fused to l. oleraceum hfd we first performed a pcr reaction with one primer outside the _PROTEIN_ promoter genomic dna fragment present in the transgene . this pcr product was then used as the template in the dcaps genotyping reaction . for each construct transgene specific pcr primers were designed and used to confirm the genotype of each transgenic line . primer sequences are available on request . representative images of rosettes were taken to days after germination . the percentage of normal seeds was determined by visual inspection using a dissecting microscope . on average seeds from five individual siliques were pooled and counted for one individual from each family identified as _PROTEIN_ transgene / _PROTEIN_ / . alexander staining of anthers was done according to published protocols . dapi stained male meiotic chromosome spreads were prepared as described in ross et al . and imaged using an olympus _METHOD_ microscope and digital scientific smartcapture software flow cytometric determination of genome content was performed on floral buds using published protocols . leaf tissue from aneuploid plants were collected and purified using dna phytopure kit . genomic dna libraries were prepared using the standard neb next dna library prep with nextflex _PROTEIN_ from bioo scientific pooled and sequenced on illumina hiseq for single reads . the resulting reads were mapped to using bwa followed by chromosome dosage analysis using the protocol described in henry et al . all the individuals that were sequenced and analyzed are identified with a unique frag identifier and are described in . reference ids for all sequences used in this study are available in . multiple alignments of protein sequences encoding the histone fold domain of _PROTEIN_ was generated using muscle and refined manually . evolutionary analyses were conducted in . phylogenetic history was inferred using the maximum likelihood method . the analysis involved protein sequences . all positions containing gaps and missing data were eliminated . there were a total of positions in the final dataset . meme with default parameters was used to identify statistically significant blocks of sequence homology in n terminal tails extracted from plant _PROTEIN_ sequences available from public databases .
