iron is necessary for all living cells but its bioavailability is often limited . fe deficiency limits agriculture in many areas and affects over a billion human beings worldwide . in mammals _PROTEIN_ was identified as a major pathway for fe acquisition and recycling . in plants _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are induced under fe deficiency . the similitude of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ patterns and their common targeting to the _LOCATION_ together with the lack of obvious phenotype in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ single knockout mutants suggested a functional redundancy . indeed the germination of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutants is arrested under low fe nutrition and fully rescued by high fe supply . mutant seeds have wild type fe content but fail to retrieve fe from the _LOCATION_ globoids . our work thus identifies for the first time the _LOCATION_ as an essential compartment for fe storage in seeds . our data indicate that mobilization of _LOCATION_ fe stores by _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ is crucial to support arabidopsis early development until efficient _METHOD_ for fe acquisition from the soil take over .
to determine in which tissues _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ we analyzed the activity of the _PROTEIN_ promoter in arabidopsis using as a reporter gene . arabidopsis was transformed with a uida gene downstream of base pairs of the genomic sequence upstream of _PROTEIN_ initiation codon . fig ref shows histochemical staining of gus activity in plants transformed with grown for days either under conditions or in an medium . plants do not show any staining . in contrast under conditions the _PROTEIN_ promoter drives the transcription of gus in both roots and shoots . the staining initiates in the early differentiation zone of the root and becomes stronger in older parts of the roots . the staining is stronger in the stele of roots and in the vascular bundles of leaves . cross sections through the root revealed preferential _PROTEIN_ in phloem tissues of the stele . similar _PROTEIN_ patterns and regulations were observed in several transformed lines either in the columbia or ws ecotype . in comparison plants transformed with grown for days either under manganese conditions or mn excess did not show any staining . to quantify the effect of fe nutrition on _PROTEIN_ promoter activity we measured gus enzymatic activity in protein extracts from the roots or shoots of arabidopsis grown either in or conditions . fig ref shows that gus activity increased and upon fe starvation in roots and shoots respectively . to determine whether the increase in _PROTEIN_ promoter activity is reflected at the protein level we performed western blot experiments using a polyclonal _PROTEIN_ antibody . fig ref shows that _PROTEIN_ was hardly detectable in root or shoot extracts from arabidopsis ws plants grown under high fe supply . in contrast _PROTEIN_ protein accumulated in shoots and in roots of plants grown under fe deficiency . in roots _PROTEIN_ levels were close to the detection limit preventing clear detection of changes in protein accumulation . in addition _PROTEIN_ protein levels also increased under mn depletion but were unaffected by mn excess . taken together our data show that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is upregulated under fe deficiency . both the _PROTEIN_ pattern of _PROTEIN_ and its upregulation under fe starvation match the regulation of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . furthermore in a. thaliana ecotype ws an increase in _PROTEIN_ protein correlates with the induction of _PROTEIN_ gene _PROTEIN_ under low fe supply . to investigate the function of _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis we screened collections of insertion mutants for mutants carrying a in the coding region of _PROTEIN_ using pcr . an allele named _PROTEIN_ was identified with a insertion base pairs downstream of the initiation codon . western blots performed on the protein extracts of leaves and roots from either homozygous _PROTEIN_ mutant or wild type plants showed that _PROTEIN_ could not be detected in the _PROTEIN_ mutant protein extract . this result indicates that _PROTEIN_ is a null allele of _PROTEIN_ . homozygous _PROTEIN_ mutants did not show any obvious phenotype either when grown on soil in the greenhouse or when grown in vitro on complete medium . owing to the strong regulation of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ by the plant fe nutrition status we tested whether _PROTEIN_ mutants exhibited any phenotype under various fe nutrition conditions . fig ref shows that no major difference between the root length of _PROTEIN_ and wild type plants could be measured after germination and development for days on synthetic media containing a range of fe concentrations . no obvious difference in the level of chlorosis under fe starvation between wild type and _PROTEIN_ could be detected . similar results were obtained when wild type and _PROTEIN_ mutant or plants overexpressing either _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ were compared in the same growth conditions . _PROTEIN_ protein levels and regulation upon fe starvation were similar in _PROTEIN_ mutants and wild type arabidopsis . in a previous study we have shown that _PROTEIN_ displays fe regulation _PROTEIN_ pattern similar to _PROTEIN_ . in addition _PROTEIN_ of a functional _METHOD_ fusion protein in arabidopsis shows that _PROTEIN_ is targeted to _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ as is _PROTEIN_ . furthermore _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ loci are located on duplicated regions of a. thaliana genome _GENE_ and _GENE_ are included in the duplicated block . to test the hypothesis that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ might encode transporters with redundant functions we generated _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutants . the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutants did not display any phenotype when grown on rich soil in the greenhouse and completed a normal life cycle . however when mutant seed germination was observed more closely on complete synthetic medium containing feedta they displayed an obvious retardation in cotyledon greening and in root growth during the first days after sowing . this phenotype was transient the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant seedlings greened and completely recovered after another days . the mutant phenotype segregated with a ratio in the progenies consistent with the independent segregation of mutant alleles . to confirm that the observed phenotype was due to the disruption of both redundant transporters _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ we tested whether _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ overexpression could complement the phenotype of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutants . using _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in seeds as a selection marker for transformation we selected independent _METHOD_ seeds from wild type transformed with the empty vector or from _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ transformed either with empty vector or with _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ cdna driven by the promoter . the phenotype of the _METHOD_ seeds was scored during germination . _PROTEIN_ of either _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ rescued the mutant phenotype in or of the primary transformants respectively . in contrast all mutant seeds transformed with the empty vector displayed a mutant phenotype . the double mutant phenotype could also be rescued by transformation with either _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ genes and with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion cdna driven by the promoter . as both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are regulated by fe and because chlorosis is often a symptom for fe deficiency we germinated _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutants under a range of fe nutrition conditions . fig ref shows that under low fe supply _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant development is arrested their roots do not elongate and their cotyledons do not green whereas wild type ws plants grown in the same conditions do not show developmental alterations during the first days after germination . when _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutants were germinated under high fe supply their growth and appearance was indistinguishable from that of wild type plants . fig ref illustrates the progressive increase in severity of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutant root growth phenotype with progressive _PROTEIN_ of fe availability in the medium . we tested whether increasing the level of other essential metals could also rescue _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ phenotype . neither an increase in zn nor an increase in mn supply rescued _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ phenotype . zn and mn rather have inhibitory effects on early development and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutants were even more sensitive to this inhibition than wild type seedlings . conversely mn and zn depletion of the growth medium altered neither the wild type nor the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutant development during the first days after sowing . together these results indicate that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ act redundantly during seed germination and that the loss of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ function results in dramatic and specific hypersensitivity to fe starvation that can be fully rescued under high fe supply . to study the consequence of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant hypersensitivity to fe starvation revealed by in vitro experiments on plant survival in soil we germinated a. thaliana and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutants either on humic soil or on calcareous soil . humic soils contain fe chelated to humic acids facilitating fe acquisition . in contrast calcareous soils often limit fe acquisition because of their alkaline ph . when and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutant arabidopsis were sown on humic soil both genotypes germinated and developed green cotyledons after days . after days seedlings of both genotypes grew to healthy plants . in contrast when wild type and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were sown on calcareous soil the wild type seedlings developed green cotyledons whereas the mutant seedlings did not green and appeared bleached after days . most _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutants did not develop further than mm bleached seedlings and after days extremely few _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutant plants had survived . in contrast most of the wild type seedlings had developed to a level comparable to the wild type plants grown on humic soil . disruption of both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ genes results in early lethality for over of arabidopsis plants when they are grown on soil . as the phenotype of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutants is particularly severe during germination under conditions we studied the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in these conditions . in addition we monitored the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ a _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ transport protein essential for fe acquisition under fe starvation . seeds containing either _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ constructs were germinated under conditions . the seedlings were stained for gus activity and days after sowing . fig ref shows that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were _PROTEIN_ during the early stages of germination . in contrast _PROTEIN_ was not _PROTEIN_ during the first days but became strongly induced on the third day . similar results were obtained under high fe supply except that _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ was lower on day and _PROTEIN_ staining disappeared on day . the timing of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ early during germination is thus consistent with the severe phenotype of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant at this developmental stage . the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in cotyledons coincides with an early developmental arrest during germination in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutants . to understand the cellular basis of this phenotype we investigated the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ protein in cotyledon cells by immunolocalization using _PROTEIN_ antibodies . fig ref illustrates the localization of _PROTEIN_ in germinating seeds . two different intracellular localization patterns were observed sometimes within the same cotyledon a punctuate localization within the _LOCATION_ and a tonoplast localization surrounding the _LOCATION_ corresponding to protein bodies in dry seeds . no specific labelling was observed in cotyledons from _PROTEIN_ mutants . at this developmental stage a marker for lytic _LOCATION_ also localized around the _LOCATION_ corresponding to protein bodies in dry seeds as well as on punctuate structures within the _LOCATION_ . to confirm that _PROTEIN_ and reside on the same _LOCATION_ coimmunolocalization experiments were performed . fig ref shows that _PROTEIN_ colocalized with in the tonoplast and in the punctuate structures within the _LOCATION_ of cotyledon cells . to further understand the function of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ during seed germination we compared the metal content in wild type and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plants . as _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutants display a strong phenotype during germination we first analyzed the metal content in seeds . table i shows the metal content in seeds roots and shoots of wild type single _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants and the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant determined by inductively coupled _LOCATION_ optical emission _METHOD_ . no significant difference in the seed contents in fe mn and zn could be detected between the wild type and any of the mutants . we then compared the metal content of wild type and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ seedlings grown for days on complete synthetic medium . table i shows that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ seedlings accumulated about more fe in their roots than wild type . apart from this moderate increase in fe the accumulation of metals was not significantly altered in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant . as _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are targeted to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutant phenotype is rescued by fe we compared the fate of _LOCATION_ fe during germination of wild type and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutants . fig ref shows the localization of fe in cells of dry arabidopsis seeds determined by electron microscopy coupled to fe esi . in both wild type and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ cotyledon seeds fe could be localized to the electron dense globoids included in the protein bodies in agreement with earlier studies on different species . this was confirmed by x ray analysis of individual globoids it revealed the presence of phosphate together with ca mg as well as zn and fe but in agreement with a previous report almost no mn . fig ref shows the localization of fe in the globoids of cotyledon cells in seedlings . whereas fe was almost undetectable in globoids of the wild type cotyledon cells at this stage fe still mapped to the globoids of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutant cotyledon _LOCATION_ days after germination . fig ref shows representative energy dispersive x ray spectra confirming the presence of fe in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ globoids days after germination while fe is missing in wild type globoids . altogether these results show that fe is retained in globoids of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutant during germination while globoid fe is rapidly mobilized from the _LOCATION_ in wild type cotyledons .
