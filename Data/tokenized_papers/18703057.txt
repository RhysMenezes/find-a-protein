we found that four type ii nad h dehydrogenases in arabidopsis are targeted to two locations in the cell _PROTEIN_ was targeted to mitochondria and chloroplasts while _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were targeted to mitochondria and _LOCATION_ . targeting of _PROTEIN_ to chloroplasts as well as mitochondria was shown using in vitro and in vivo uptake assays and dual targeting of _PROTEIN_ to _LOCATION_ relies on regions in the mature part of the protein . accumulation of nda type dehydrogenases to _LOCATION_ and mitochondria was confirmed using western blot analysis on highly purified organelle fractions . targeting of nd proteins to mitochondria and _LOCATION_ is achieved by two separate signals a c terminal signal for _LOCATION_ and an n terminal signal for mitochondria .
a clustalw alignment of all nd sequences available from various plant species and yeast revealed the amino acid sequence _PROTEIN_ at the c terminal end of arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and in a variety of nd proteins from other plants . other _PROTEIN_ i type targeting signals most notably _PROTEIN_ or ssi were also found in nd sequences . the _PROTEIN_ that these amino acids are not present in all nd sequences suggests that this tripeptide is not required for function opening the possibility that it may play a role in defining subcellular localisation via its peroxisomal targeting activity . analysis of _PROTEIN_ sequences from arabidopsis rice and chlamydomonas reinhardtii predicted _LOCATION_ targeting in all three species based on the n terminal region _PROTEIN_ even though these proteins display very low levels of sequence identity in this region . examination of the gene constructs used in a previous study that indicated an exclusive mitochondrial localisation for these proteins revealed that only the n terminal region was used in the _METHOD_ fusions amino acids for _PROTEIN_ for _PROTEIN_ for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and amino acids for _PROTEIN_ . the full length cdna for _PROTEIN_ was placed in front of _METHOD_ and its subcellular localisation examined by particle bombardment . as controls the cells transformed with the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ construct were co transformed either with _LOCATION_ targeted _METHOD_ using the targeting signal of the small subunit of ribulose bisphosphate _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or the mitochondrial alternative oxidase targeting signal _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . targeting of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ to chloroplasts was clearly observed in arabidopsis suspension cells the pattern was clearly not identical to _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ but resembled that of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ quite closely . this is in contrast to what has been previously reported where a mitochondrial localisation was concluded when the first amino acids of _PROTEIN_ was used . however we routinely observed a weaker signal similar to the pattern obtained with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . thus we tested the targeting ability in a variety of tissues namely arabidopsis seedlings and onion epidermal cells . transformation of these tissues resulted in the detection of two distinct signals a _LOCATION_ signal evidenced by relatively large organelles in diameter and few in number and smaller organelles or less in diameter typical of a mitochondrial pattern . the mitochondrial targeting ability of _PROTEIN_ that we observed in this study is consistent with previous results using _METHOD_ and in vitro uptake assays . to confirm that _PROTEIN_ could target to both chloroplasts and mitochondria in vitro uptake assays with isolated arabidopsis mitochondria and pea chloroplasts were carried out . upon incubation with isolated chloroplasts and mitochondria the _PROTEIN_ precursor protein with a mol _METHOD_ of kda was imported into a protease resistant location and processed to a mature size with a mol _METHOD_ of kda . both organelles appeared to process the precursor protein to the same mature protein to confirm this import reactions into mitochondria and chloroplasts were loaded into the same lane to determine any small difference in mobility none was detected . as the translation of the precursor alone also produces a protein with a mol _METHOD_ of kda likely due to translation initiation at an internal methionine such as amino acid in _PROTEIN_ . translation initiation at internal methionine residues is frequently observed with in vitro translation lysates . thus we confirmed that the protease resistance was due to import into the respective organelle . import into mitochondria was inhibited by the addition of valinomycin and import into chloroplast inhibited by the addition of cucl . the specificity of import into the respective organelles was confirmed as the small subunit of bisphosphate _PROTEIN_ was only imported into chloroplasts and the alternative oxidase precursor only imported into mitochondria . in order to determine the localisation of the other nd proteins n and c terminal _METHOD_ fusions were made followed by particle bombardment . to determine a mitochondrial and peroxisomal pattern chimeric constructs with the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ linked to _METHOD_ were used . in the case of _PROTEIN_ attaching _METHOD_ to the c terminal resulted in targeting to mitochondria as evidenced by co localisation with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . attaching the last amino acids of _PROTEIN_ to the c terminal end of _METHOD_ resulted in a _LOCATION_ localisation for _METHOD_ as evidenced by _METHOD_ throughout the cell in all tissues tested . in contrast when _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were tested in a similar manner both mitochondrial and peroxisomal targeting ability was detected . c terminal fusions gave an exclusively mitochondrial localisation based on co localisation with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . this is consistent with the mitochondrial targeting ability previously observed with these proteins . however when the last amino acids of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were placed at the c terminal region of _METHOD_ peroxisomal targeting was observed . the peroxisomal targeting ability of these constructs was also detected in arabidopsis seedlings and onion cells . thus we concluded that these proteins were targeted to _LOCATION_ in addition to mitochondria . _PROTEIN_ targeted _METHOD_ to mitochondria as previously reported _PROTEIN_ . to confirm the dual location of _PROTEIN_ in mitochondria and _LOCATION_ we raised antibodies against _PROTEIN_ expected to be located in both locations from results above and _PROTEIN_ expected to be located only in mitochondria from results above . we confirmed that the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ antibodies did not cross react with the other antigen by over _PROTEIN_ of the respective proteins in an in vitro translation lysate probing with anti his antibodies that detected both proteins anti antibodies that detected only _PROTEIN_ and anti _PROTEIN_ antibodies that detected only _PROTEIN_ . as the _PROTEIN_ antibody was raised against a fragment of the _PROTEIN_ protein on amino acids that displayed sequence identity with the corresponding region of _PROTEIN_ we tested if the _PROTEIN_ antibody cross reacted with _PROTEIN_ . no cross reactivity was detected with full length in vitro synthesised _PROTEIN_ . highly purified mitochondria and _LOCATION_ fractions were isolated from arabidopsis cells and proteins separated by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and subjected to western blotting . in control experiments we used antibodies against proven markers of mitochondria _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ . these antibodies reacted strongly with mitochondrial and peroxisomal fractions respectively and much more weakly with the other fraction indicating a small degree of cross contamination between the fractions . densitometric analysis revealed the _PROTEIN_ signal in mitochondria was of that detected in _LOCATION_ whilst the _PROTEIN_ signal in _LOCATION_ was of the signal that could be detected in mitochondria . probing with antibodies raised against _PROTEIN_ resulted in the detection of a single protein band with an apparent molecular _METHOD_ of kda in both mitochondrial and _LOCATION_ fractions . the blots indicated that there was more _PROTEIN_ protein in the peroxisomal fraction than in the mitochondrial one confirming that these proteins are found in both compartments . probing mitochondrial and peroxisomal fractions with antibodies raised against the _PROTEIN_ specific peptide produced a band only in the mitochondrial fraction confirming that it can target to mitochondria but not to _LOCATION_ . importantly this latter result also shows that the very small amount of cross contamination between the two isolated fractions can not explain the dual localisation of the _PROTEIN_ signal . thus the western blot results confirm the _METHOD_ data .
the full length coding sequences of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were cloned as both n and c terminal _METHOD_ fusions by gateway cloning under the control of the camv promoter . additionally the last amino acids of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were cloned to the c terminus of _METHOD_ . the alternative oxidase _PROTEIN_ targeting signal the full length targeting sequence of small subunit of ribulose bisphosphate _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and the peroxisomal targeting signal _PROTEIN_ of pumpkin malate synthase were fused to red _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ and used as mitochondrial chloroplast and peroxisomal controls respectively . the constructs were used to transform arabidopsis suspension culture cells arabidopsis seedlings and onion epidermal cells by biolistic transformation as previously outlined . _METHOD_ patterns were obtained h after transformation by visualization under an olympus _METHOD_ microscope with excitation wavelengths of _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ . emissions were collected for _METHOD_ between and and _METHOD_ between and and imaged using the cell r imaging software . to ensure no cross over in detection of signals _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were co transformed to ensure that the filters were detecting the appropriate signal . n and c terminal _METHOD_ tagged proteins were used to transform arabidopsis cell suspension culture week old arabidopsis seedlings and onion epidermal cells by biolistic transformation as previously outlined . for each construct to be tested three transformations were carried out the test construct with a mitochondrial _LOCATION_ and peroxisomal control . in vitro import assays into isolated arabidopsis mitochondria and pea chloroplasts were carried out as previously outlined . antibodies were raised in rabbit against _PROTEIN_ amino acids and the _PROTEIN_ specific peptide at amino acids . the specificity of the antibodies was tested against recombinant proteins synthesised in a wheat germ translation lysate according to manufacturers instructions programmed to synthesise _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ by making linear templates by pcr as per manufactures instructions . mitochondria and _LOCATION_ were purified from day old cell suspension culture using free flow electrophoresis as described by eubel et al . . western blot analysis was carried out against of mitochondrial and peroxisomal proteins separated by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ as previously outlined .
