catenin and related proteins have important functions during animal and dictyostelium development regulating cell differentiation proliferation and adhesion . armadillo repeatcontaining proteins also exist in plants but the majority have unknown roles . the arabidopsis genes that show greatest sequence homology to catenin are called _PROTEIN_ and . here we demonstrate that _PROTEIN_ and promote _PROTEIN_ root development . arabidillo mutants form fewer _PROTEIN_ roots and _PROTEIN_ overexpressing lines produce more _PROTEIN_ roots than wild type seedlings . _PROTEIN_ yellow _METHOD_ protein fusions are _LOCATION_ . _PROTEIN_ proteins contain an f box motif and thus may target other proteins for proteasomal degradation . overexpression of _PROTEIN_ protein fragments including f box fragments in wild type seedlings reduces _PROTEIN_ root formation to the level of the arabidillo mutant . we have shown that plant catenin related proteins regulate root development . we suggest that _PROTEIN_ proteins may target an inhibitor of _PROTEIN_ root development for degradation and propose that arabidopsis catenin related proteins define a previously uncharacterized pathway that promotes root branching .
arabidopsis genes related to catenin/arm are _PROTEIN_ throughout the plant . as described previously _PROTEIN_ and show the greatest sequence homology of any arabidopsis genes to dictyostelium and metazoan catenin/armadillo . there is a single _PROTEIN_ homologue in the model monocot rice _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ and contain nine arm repeats and share amino acid identity . dictyostelium catenin _PROTEIN_ and and oryza _PROTEIN_ have an f box motif _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ is also annotated as . the f box/arm repeat domain structure is unique to these four proteins . _PROTEIN_ and contain a basic _LOCATION_ localization signal at their n termini . _PROTEIN_ and mrna is detected in all plant organs tested by rt rcr . the spatial _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ and was analyzed by fusing their putative promoters to the _PROTEIN_ gene . parabidillo gus is active in both roots and shoots of seedlings . gus activity is strongest in the root tip pericycle and vasculature . parabidillo gus is also detected in both root and shoot although strong _PROTEIN_ is absent from mature primary and _PROTEIN_ root tips where gus activity is detected only in the columella . both _PROTEIN_ promoters are active in all cells of _PROTEIN_ root primordia with mature _PROTEIN_ root _PROTEIN_ patterns refining to resemble primary root patterns as the roots elongate and develop . _PROTEIN_ and act redundantly to promote _PROTEIN_ root development . to examine the in planta functions of _PROTEIN_ and arabidopsis t dna insertion lines were obtained . neither the arabidillo nor single mutant showed any obvious phenotype . _PROTEIN_ and are very similar to each other and show overlapping _PROTEIN_ patterns and thus could be functionally redundant . accordingly when grown on vertical plates arabidillo double mutants develop fewer _PROTEIN_ roots than wild type plants or either single mutant despite having similar primary root lengths to wild type . the same result was obtained by using medium with sucrose or basal medium . this phenotype could be rescued by stably _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ proteins from their own promoters suggesting that _PROTEIN_ and have a positive function during _PROTEIN_ root development . to test this hypothesis further arabidopsis seedlings _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ yellow _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ were assayed on vertical plates . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ overexpression increases _PROTEIN_ root formation . to assay the stage of _PROTEIN_ root development affected by _PROTEIN_ and the number of _PROTEIN_ root primordia in wild type arabidillo and _PROTEIN_ overexpressing seedlings was observed at high magnification . arabidillo and _PROTEIN_ overexpressors show a significant _PROTEIN_ and increase respectively in lrp density compared with wild type . no significant changes in _PROTEIN_ stages of _PROTEIN_ root development were observed indicating that _PROTEIN_ and function redundantly to promote _PROTEIN_ root development in arabidopsis by controlling _PROTEIN_ root initiation rather than subsequent stages of _PROTEIN_ root development . _PROTEIN_ and do not act directly in known _PROTEIN_ root regulatory pathways . to test whether _PROTEIN_ and act within known signaling networks to promote _PROTEIN_ root development responses to _LOCATION_ signals were assayed . the plant hormone auxin is required for many developmental processes including _PROTEIN_ root formation . auxin signaling mutants have reduced _PROTEIN_ root density . however mutation of auxinsignaling proteins also affects additional processes such as shoot size primary root length gravitropism and floral development . auxin signaling mutants are less sensitive to the effects of exogenous auxins and auxin transport inhibitors . arabidillo mutants and _PROTEIN_ overexpressing lines have primary root lengths similar to wild type and do not have auxin related shoot phenotypes . the arabidillo mutant and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ overexpressing lines were grown on the auxins indole acetic acid and dichlorophenoxyacetic acid for days . both the arabidillo mutant and the _PROTEIN_ overexpressing lines displayed wild type root growth inhibition responses indicating that _PROTEIN_ and do not change auxin perception or response . in addition arabidillo mutants and _PROTEIN_ overexpressors show an increased _PROTEIN_ root density when treated with iaa and similar to wild type . _PROTEIN_ of the auxin responsive reporter _METHOD_ is identical in wild type and arabidillo mutants in primary roots dividing pericycle cells that form very early _PROTEIN_ root primordia and emerged _PROTEIN_ roots . these data suggest that _PROTEIN_ and are not directly involved in auxin signaling during _PROTEIN_ root development . arabidillo mutant and _PROTEIN_ overexpressing seedlings show a similar response to wild type when treated with abscisic acid . aba is postulated to affect _PROTEIN_ root elongation rather than initiation and so is likely to be working at a _PROTEIN_ developmental stage than _PROTEIN_ and . this also suggests that nitrate or osmoticasensing pathways do not depend on _PROTEIN_ and . arabidillo mutants and _PROTEIN_ overexpressing seedlings responded similarly to wild type when depleted of nutrients . thus _PROTEIN_ function defines a previously uncharacterized mechanism for promoting _PROTEIN_ root development . _PROTEIN_ and proteins localize to the _LOCATION_ . animal catenin has both _LOCATION_ and cytoskeletal functions . to determine where _PROTEIN_ and might function in cells the full length proteins were _PROTEIN_ as _METHOD_ fusions driven from the cauliflower mosaic virus promoter . both _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ are detected exclusively in _LOCATION_ . despite being _PROTEIN_ from the promoter the fusion proteins are detected only in root cells . this result could be due to spatial regulation of _PROTEIN_ translation cell specific _PROTEIN_ protein degradation or low levels of protein _PROTEIN_ coupled with the relative ease of _METHOD_ protein detection in root cells compared with shoot . _PROTEIN_ protein targeting . to understand how the various _PROTEIN_ sequence motifs contribute to protein function a series of truncated _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusions was generated and _PROTEIN_ stably in arabidopsis . for each protein the subcellular localization of _METHOD_ was identified . the first aa of _PROTEIN_ fused to _METHOD_ localize to the _LOCATION_ . mutation of single residues in the nls has no effect on the localization of residues but mutation of pairs of residues moves localization away from the _LOCATION_ and into the _LOCATION_ . deletion of the first or aa of this sequence also leads to a partial relocation of the fusion protein to the _LOCATION_ . addition of a gus protein module to the f box upstream of _METHOD_ relocates the f box to the _LOCATION_ suggesting that the partial _LOCATION_ localization seen with proteins and is because their small size allows diffusion into the _LOCATION_ . _PROTEIN_ of the entire n terminus of _PROTEIN_ up to the start of the arm repeat domain or the n terminus without the nls does not lead to _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . this result might be due to a degradation signal in _PROTEIN_ between residues and . a protein consisting of partial n terminus the arm repeat domain and c terminal region is _LOCATION_ as are similar constructs with truncated c termini . a protein containing only the arm domain and c terminus localizes to the _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ . the partial _LOCATION_ localization of residues shows that _PROTEIN_ protein can localize to the _LOCATION_ in the absence of a classical nls presumably through its arm repeat domain as is seen with catenin . there are two putative _LOCATION_ export signals between residues and but the localization of residues is not sensitive to leptomycin b . overexpression of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein fragments reduces _PROTEIN_ root development . to understand how _PROTEIN_ proteins promote _PROTEIN_ root development we observed the effect of truncated _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein overexpression on _PROTEIN_ root number . wild type seedlings _PROTEIN_ f box fragments form a similar number of _PROTEIN_ roots to arabidillo mutants suggesting that f box fragments block endogenous _PROTEIN_ activity by disrupting the interaction between the full length proteins and a binding partner for example component of the proteasome . seedlings overexpressing _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ form a reduced number of _PROTEIN_ roots suggesting that this protein also inhibits endogenous _PROTEIN_ function . none of the seedlings _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ protein fragments show additional phenotypes suggesting that the fragments act as _PROTEIN_ specific dominant negatives. thus we conclude that both the f box and the c terminal domain are required for in vivo _PROTEIN_ protein function and that both regions of the protein may interact with specific protein partners .
