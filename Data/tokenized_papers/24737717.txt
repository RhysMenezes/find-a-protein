root hairs are responsible for water and nutrient uptake from the soil and their growth is responsive to biotic and abiotic changes in their environment . root hair expansion is a _PROTEIN_ process requiring secretory and endosomal pathways that deliver and recycle _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and cell wall material to the growing root hair tip . in this paper the role of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ a member of the vti vesicular soluble _PROTEIN_ attachment receptor gene family in arabidopsis thaliana in root hair growth is described . genetic analysis and complementation of the _PROTEIN_ root hair phenotypes of arabidopsis thaliana were first used to assess the role of _PROTEIN_ in root hair growth . transgenic lines _PROTEIN_ a green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ construct were used to characterize the intracellular localization of _PROTEIN_ in root hairs using confocal microscopy and immunotransmission electron microscopy . _PROTEIN_ was characterized and genetic analysis used to show that its function is required for root hair growth . _PROTEIN_ of a _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion in the _PROTEIN_ mutant background was shown to complement the _PROTEIN_ root hair phenotype . _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ localized to both the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and a mobile endosomal compartment . the function of _PROTEIN_ was also required for the localization of _PROTEIN_ to the trans _LOCATION_ network . immunohistochemical analysis indicated that cell wall organization is altered in _PROTEIN_ root hairs and root epidermal cells . these results show that _PROTEIN_ plays a unique role in endosomal trafficking pathways associated with the _LOCATION_ within root hairs and is essential for the _PROTEIN_ of cell wall organization and root hair growth in arabidopsis .
the _PROTEIN_ of the structural cell wall protein proline rich protein _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is linked to root hair development where it is localized to root hair cell walls and is required for root hair growth in arabidopsis . microarray analysis of the t dna insertion mutant _PROTEIN_ identified _PROTEIN_ as a gene whose _PROTEIN_ is up regulated in roots of _PROTEIN_ when compared with wild type roots . rt pcr analysis was used to confirm the microarray results and showed that _PROTEIN_ transcripts were detected at very low levels in wild type roots but were detected at higher levels in roots of the _PROTEIN_ mutant . these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ may be sensitive to root hair cell wall structure . table in gene _PROTEIN_ of vti type snare family members observed in

medium conditions . asterisks denote statistical significances of differences in average root hair length compared with wild type seedlings grown on the same media using one way _PROTEIN_ analysis . results are from one representative experiment and are given as the mean s.e . scale bars . to determine if _PROTEIN_ was required for root hair growth we analysed _PROTEIN_ which contains a t dna insertion in the second exon of the _PROTEIN_ gene . using rt pcr we could not detect any _PROTEIN_ transcript in the _PROTEIN_ mutant indicating that this line is a null mutant . in contrast we found no discernable difference in the amount of transcript encoding _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ two other vti family members in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . to determine if the loss of _PROTEIN_ resulted in root hair growth phenotypes _PROTEIN_ and wild type seedlings were grown for days on _METHOD_ medium and examined using bright field microscopy . in comparison with wild type the root hairs on _PROTEIN_ seedlings were shorter and exhibited branching . we then asked whether _PROTEIN_ root hair growth was sensitive to changes in the growth environment by comparing _PROTEIN_ root hair growth with that of wild type seedlings in response to two other medium conditions . when grown in the presence of mm mannitol _PROTEIN_ seedling root hairs exhibited a much more severe root hair branching phenotype than that detected in wild type or in _PROTEIN_ grown in the absence of mannitol . these results indicate that _PROTEIN_ is required for _PROTEIN_ growth in root hairs and that the _PROTEIN_ phenotype can be enhanced by osmotic stress . in contrast when wild type and _PROTEIN_ seedlings were grown on _METHOD_ medium at ph root hair length of wild type seedlings was similar to that observed at ph whereas the root hairs of _PROTEIN_ seedlings were longer and did not branch suggesting that low ph may be able to compensate for _PROTEIN_ altering _PROTEIN_ root hair growth . to further confirm that the _PROTEIN_ root hair mutant phenotypes were due to the absence of _PROTEIN_ we examined root hair growth in transgenic seedlings _PROTEIN_ either a _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ or a _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ construct in the _PROTEIN_ mutant background . four to five lines that were _PROTEIN_ resistant and showed similar _PROTEIN_ in the _PROTEIN_ and wild type backgrounds were identified for each construct . from these initial studies one transgenic line _PROTEIN_ either _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was chosen for further analyses . _PROTEIN_ of the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ protein fusion driven by either promoter complemented the _PROTEIN_ mutant root hair phenotype . additionally root hair growth was not affected by _PROTEIN_ of the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ construct in wild type seedlings . lastly when the complemented _PROTEIN_ lines were grown in the presence of mm mannitol their root hair growth was indistinguishable from that of wild type root hairs . these results indicate that the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ constructs complemented the _PROTEIN_ root hair phenotypes and that _PROTEIN_ is essential for normal root hair growth . fig . _PROTEIN_ can be complemented by the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion protein . seedlings were grown for days on _METHOD_ medium ph . root hairs of wild type _PROTEIN_ and seedlings of complemented _PROTEIN_ lines

results shown are from one representative experiment and represent the average of six to ten seedlings for each genotype and are given as the mean s.e . scale bars . to identify the intracellular compartments within which _PROTEIN_ functions we characterized _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ subcellular localization in root epidermal cells and root hair cells using confocal scanning laser microscopy . while both constructs complemented _PROTEIN_ the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ lines yielded higher contrast images and were used for all subsequent cslm experiments except when stated otherwise . _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was observed in two distinct subcellular locations the _LOCATION_ of a large internal compartment and smaller compartments that were punctate and mobile . we also observed _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in _LOCATION_ bulb like structures which have been characterized previously with respect to the localization of family member _PROTEIN_ within _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . _PROTEIN_ localized to these structures in both epidermal cells at the root tip and in root hairs . fig . of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in root epidermal cells and root hairs of day old arabidopsis seedlings . _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in

to show the cross section view of the cell . scale bars . due to its intracellular localization in suspension cultured cells we wanted to confirm that _PROTEIN_ localized to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ in root hairs and determine if the _PROTEIN_ punctate structures represented a class of endosomes . to confirm that the large _PROTEIN_ labelled internal _LOCATION_ corresponded to the _LOCATION_ transgenic lines _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in a wild type background were crossed with a transgenic line _PROTEIN_ a resident _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ protein _METHOD_ . _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was found to co localize with the _LOCATION_ marker _METHOD_ at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ only and not in the small mobile _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ compartments in growing root hairs . these results support a role for _PROTEIN_ in the transport or docking of vesicles at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ during root hair growth . to investigate the nature of the small punctate _PROTEIN_ labelled internal structures we treated _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ seedlings with the lipophilic dye which is used to label the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and internal _LOCATION_ involved in endosomal trafficking . when these seedlings were labelled with for min no co labelling between and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was observed in root hairs indicating that _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ did not localize within the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . however after longer treatments of min with we did observe co localization in some of the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ mobile fraction within small puncta near the root hair tip suggesting that this might represent a population of endosomal compartments . in these experiments a similar pattern of localization for _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was observed in both root tip epidermal cells and root hairs indicating that _PROTEIN_ localization is similar in these two cell types and that _PROTEIN_ is a component of intracellular _LOCATION_ . endocytosis and vesicular trafficking are dependent on the structure of the actin _LOCATION_ but not on microtubule organization . to investigate whether the mobility of the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ labelled compartments required an intact actin _LOCATION_ we treated day old seedlings with nm latrunculin b an actin depolymerizing agent for min . root hairs were then examined for the mobility of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ labelled compartments using cslm . when seedlings were treated with vehicle alone there was dynamic movement of both the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ labelled _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and the punctate compartments which moved over long distances along the shaft of the root hair . seedlings treated with oryzalin a molecule that depolymerizes microtubules had no effect on the movement of the _PROTEIN_ labelled _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ or mobile compartments in root hairs when compared with _METHOD_ treated seedlings . in contrast treatment of root hairs with latrunculin b resulted in the loss of long distance movement of the small cytoplasmic puncta as well as dynamic changes in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . these data demonstrate that the mobility of the _PROTEIN_ labelled _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and the small mobile _PROTEIN_ containing compartments requires an intact actin _LOCATION_ during root hair growth . fig . labelled compartment mobility requires the actin _LOCATION_ . the distribution of _PROTEIN_ labelled compartments in the _PROTEIN_ complemented lines was diffuse throughout the root hairs of day old seedlings treated with nm _METHOD_ or oryzalin and became aggregated after treatment with nm latrunculin b . all treatments were performed at root temperature for h. scale bars . _PROTEIN_ labelled compartment mobility requires the actin _LOCATION_ . the distribution of _PROTEIN_ labelled compartments in the _PROTEIN_ complemented lines was diffuse throughout the root hairs of day old seedlings treated with nm _METHOD_ or oryzalin and became aggregated after treatment with nm latrunculin b . all treatments were performed at root temperature for h. scale bars . as a first step in determining the identity of the mobile and punctate _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ labelled compartments in root hairs we treated seedlings with the fungal toxin bfa . bfa has been shown to selectively inhibit _PROTEIN_ exchange _PROTEIN_ which activate adp ribosylation _PROTEIN_ and are required for vesicle trafficking between endosomal compartments in eukaryotes . in plants there are bfa sensitive and bfa resistant arf gefs whose localization in different endosomal compartments can be species and tissue specific . while the arf gef _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ that is associated with the _LOCATION_ apparatus is considered bfa resistant in arabidopsis roots concentrations of bfa greater than induce a morphological aggregation of tgn containing _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in arabidopsis root protoplasts . although the exact _METHOD_ behind the variety of bfa effects in plants are still being defined it is well accepted that bfa provides a tool to distinguish between different classes of endosomal compartments . we analysed _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ labelled compartment sensitivity to bfa by treating day old seedlings with vehicle alone or with a low or intermediate concentration of bfa for min . the seedlings treated with bfa for min showed no discernable difference in _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ organization or localization when compared with seedlings treated with vehicle alone particularly with respect to the mobility of _PROTEIN_ labelled compartments . in contrast when seedlings were treated with bfa for min the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ compartments became larger and less mobile . interestingly the _PROTEIN_ labelled compartments did not co localize with the endosomal trafficking tracer after bfa treatment . additionally when seedlings were treated with bfa for h _PROTEIN_ labelled compartments were found to be distinct from those labelled with and were characteristic of the bfa compartments thought to be composed of early endosomes and tgn derived compartments . this contrasts with the bfa compartments that did label with in these experiments which are likely due to the accumulation of endocytosed labelled _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . together these data suggest that _PROTEIN_ localizes to early endosome or tgn compartments that are sensitive to bfa in a similar manner to that which has been observed in arabidopsis root protoplasts . fig . labelled compartments are sensitive to bfa . scanning laser confocal micrographs of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ seedlings treated with and _METHOD_ bfa or bfa for min only exhibited sensitivity at higher concentrations of bfa . still frames from each treatment were taken from live images of treated root hairs . arrows point to _PROTEIN_ labelled compartments whose mobility was

localization of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in root hairs of day old arabidopsis seedlings . when root hairs of _PROTEIN_ complemented lines _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ were labelled with an anti _METHOD_ antibody gold particles were seen at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ the _LOCATION_ apparatus and the periphery of the _LOCATION_ stacks . these data together with our previous analysis of _METHOD_

was required for tgn function or organization we compared _PROTEIN_ labelling in roots and root hairs of both _PROTEIN_ and wild type seedlings using immunolabelling and electron microscopy . interestingly when we used monoclonal antibodies against _PROTEIN_ to label _PROTEIN_ root hair sections we found that the gold particles labelled the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ as well as the tgn whereas in wild type root hairs _PROTEIN_ labelling was restricted to the _LOCATION_ apparatus and tgn . these data indicate that _PROTEIN_ function is important for localization to and/or _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ within the tgn and suggest that tgn trafficking may be compromised in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . fig . function is important for tgn compartment organization . _PROTEIN_ antibodies

_PROTEIN_ and function . to test this directly we used the antibody to label xyloglucan epitopes in root hair cell walls of wild type and _PROTEIN_ mutant seedlings . we hypothesized that if cell wall organization were altered in _PROTEIN_ root hairs we would see a change in labelling when compared with labelling patterns of wild type root hairs . using cslm we observed ubiquitous distribution in the walls of wild type root epidermal cells and root hairs . in the _PROTEIN_ mutant labelling was minimal along the root epidermis and in root hairs . these results suggest that xyloglucan may be underrepresented in _PROTEIN_ mutant cell walls or that the organization of _PROTEIN_ cell walls has been altered in such a way that the epitope recognized by is no longer accessible to the antibody . these results support the hypothesis that _PROTEIN_ function and/or the pathways in which it functions are important for root hair cell wall organization or structure and that the cell wall of _PROTEIN_ root hairs is altered from that of wild type root hairs . fig . _PROTEIN_ mutant seedling root epidermal cells and root hairs exhibit altered cell wall organization . confocal microscopy

little to no labelling of the cell wall of root epidermal cells and root hairs . bright field images of root hairs in respectively . secondary antibodies alone did not label the cell wall of wild type root hairs . all images were taken with the confocal microscope at the same settings to show the difference in labelling at the same setting and antibody concentration . scale bars . the _PROTEIN_

function may be directly or indirectly involved in cell wall metabolism . based on our original observation that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is upregulated in the _PROTEIN_ mutant we were interested in examining if this overexpression might contribute to changes in cell wall structure that would result in the short branched _PROTEIN_ root hair phenotype . if this were the case then a loss of _PROTEIN_ function in the _PROTEIN_ mutant background might result in suppression of the _PROTEIN_ root hair phenotype . to address this genetically we analysed root hair growth in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant . we found the root hair phenotypes characteristic of the single mutant parents were partially rescued in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant . the labelling of root hairs that was lost in _PROTEIN_ was also recovered in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant . root hairs of the double mutant no longer branched and were of similar length to wild type root hairs . additionally when grown in the presence of mm mannitol the root hairs of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant responded much more like those of wild type seedlings than those associated with either of the single _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ mutants . these data demonstrate that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in root hairs is important for normal cell wall organization and suggest that its misregulation in the _PROTEIN_ mutant may contribute a change in cell wall organization that is reflected in the observed defects in root hair growth . fig . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant suppresses the root hair

transcriptase according to the standard protocol . for rt pcr the _PROTEIN_ forward and reverse primers described in supplementary data table were used with the first strand cdna templates to amplify gene products using phusion taq polymerase . a _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ construct was kindly provided by dr masa sato and was subcloned into the pentr/d topo vector to use in gateway cloning . _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was cloned into the gateway destination vector pearleygate using the lr clonase ii reaction kit according to the manufacturer 's directions . clones containing _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in the vector were transformed into agrobacterium tumefaciens strain after which the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ construct was transformed into arabidopsis using the floral dip method . a kb dna fragment just upstream of the _PROTEIN_ translational start codon and including the utr was amplified from genomic dna using primers that added bamhi and ncoi restriction enzyme sites at the ends _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . this pcr product was then subcloned into the pentr/d topo entry vector using the manufacturer 's protocol to produce . this construct and were digested with both bamhi and ncoi and then gel purified to extract the kb _PROTEIN_ promoter fragment from and the promoterless linear plasmid . the _PROTEIN_ promoter was inserted upstream of the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ construct using standard

background was crossed with the _METHOD_ transgenic line and heterozygous seedlings were analysed by confocal microscopy . all _METHOD_ lines were imaged with a zeiss confocal lsm meta laser scanning microscope using a oil immersion objective . the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion lines were excited with an argon ion laser line _PROTEIN_ beam splitter of nm and emissions were captured using a nm bypass filter . when staining was imaged with the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ lines the samples were excited at nm with the argon ion laser with a _PROTEIN_ beam splitter of nm and an additional splitter of nm . the nm bypass filter was used to capture _METHOD_ emission and a nm long pass filter was used to capture the emission . _METHOD_ protein fusions were excited with a _PROTEIN_ beam splitter of nm and emissions were captured with a nm bypass filter . cross talk between _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ emission was taken into account by controlling the gain of each bypass filter orientation . the lsm meta software was used to acquire images and movies of root hair and epidermal cells . images were then processed using imagej . roots were fixed in glutaraldehyde in sorensen 's buffer _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_
