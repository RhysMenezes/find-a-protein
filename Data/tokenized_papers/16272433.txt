secondary walls in vessels and fibers of dicotyledonous plants are _PROTEIN_ composed of cellulose xylan and lignin . although genes involved in biosynthesis of cellulose and lignin have been intensively studied little is known about genes participating in xylan synthesis . we found that arabidopsis thaliana fragile _PROTEIN_ is defective in xylan synthesis . the _PROTEIN_ mutation caused a dramatic reduction in fiber wall _PROTEIN_ and a _PROTEIN_ in stem strength . _PROTEIN_ was found to encode a member of glycosyltransferase family and exhibits high sequence similarity to tobacco pectin _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ specifically in developing vessels and fiber cells and _PROTEIN_ is targeted to _LOCATION_ . comparative analyses of cell wall polysaccharide fractions from _PROTEIN_ and wild type _METHOD_ showed that the xylan and cellulose contents are drastically reduced in _PROTEIN_ whereas xyloglucan and pectin are elevated . further structural analysis of cell walls revealed that although wild type xylans contain both _PROTEIN_ acid and o methylglucuronic acid residues xylans from _PROTEIN_ retain only o methylglucuronic acid indicating that the _PROTEIN_ mutation results in a specific defect in the addition of _PROTEIN_ acid residues onto xylans . these findings suggest that _PROTEIN_ is a _PROTEIN_ involved in the biosynthesis of _PROTEIN_ during secondary wall formation .
arabidopsis inflorescence _METHOD_ develop interfascicular fibers that confer increased mechanical strength to the stem as demonstrated in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . to investigate genes involved in secondary wall synthesis we screened for arabidopsis mutants defective in fiber wall strength and isolated _PROTEIN_ a previously unidentified mutant . the _PROTEIN_ mutation caused a dramatic reduction in the mechanical strength of _METHOD_ . the force required for breaking apart the bottom parts of mature _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was times less than that for the wild type . to determine whether the fragile stem phenotype in _PROTEIN_ was caused by defective fibers we examined fiber cell morphology and wall _PROTEIN_ . cross and longitudinal sections of _METHOD_ showed that although the length of fiber cells was not affected in the _PROTEIN_ mutant the wall _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ fibers was greatly _PROTEIN_ compared with that of the wild type . transmission electron microscopy demonstrated that the wall _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ fibers was reduced to of that of the wild type . since the staining did not resolve the distinct layers of secondary walls it is not certain whether the _PROTEIN_ mutation affected the deposition of specific cell wall layers . it was also found that the _PROTEIN_ mutation resulted in deformation of xylem vessels in _METHOD_ and roots . in the _PROTEIN_ mutant the vessel walls often collapsed inward most likely due to the reduced wall strength . this phenotype is similar to the collapsed xylem phenotype caused by mutations of cellulose synthase genes involved in secondary wall synthesis and by downregulation of lignin biosynthesis in tobacco and arabidopsis . the wall _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ vessels was reduced to of that of the wild type as shown by transmission electron microscopy . these results demonstrate that the _PROTEIN_ mutation causes a dramatic _PROTEIN_ in secondary wall _PROTEIN_ in both fibers and vessels . wall _PROTEIN_ of fibers and vessels in the _METHOD_ of wild type and _PROTEIN_ mutant plants in addition to the defective cell wall phenotypes we found that the _PROTEIN_ mutation affected plant growth . the _PROTEIN_ inflorescence _METHOD_ were shorter in height and its rosette leaves were smaller in size as compared with the wild type . it was also noted that _PROTEIN_ leaves exhibited a mild wilty phenotype on sunny afternoons under greenhouse conditions even when the plants were well watered . it is likely that the deformed vessels in _PROTEIN_ impede the transport of water and minerals which in turn results in the wilty phenotype and the reduced plant growth . this wilty phenotype is similar albeit to a lesser extent to the reduced water transport and wilty phenotype of the tomato wilty dwarf mutant in which the vessels have compound perforation plates instead of simple perforation plates as seen in the wild type . to further investigate the function of _PROTEIN_ we undertook the positional cloning of the _PROTEIN_ gene . using mapping plants generated by crossing the _PROTEIN_ mutant and the wild type ecotype landsberg _LOCATION_ we mapped the _PROTEIN_ locus to a region near the _PROTEIN_ marker on chromosome . further mapping with adjacent markers revealed that the _PROTEIN_ locus was located between _PROTEIN_ and markers . based on the sequence information of bac clones between these two markers we developed additional mapping markers and used them to gradually narrow the _PROTEIN_ locus to a kb region within the bac clone . according to the genome annotations of chromosome from the arabidopsis genome database the kb region in which the _PROTEIN_ locus is located encompasses nine putative genes . in order to determine which of these genes carried the _PROTEIN_ mutation we sequenced all nine genes from the _PROTEIN_ mutant . comparison of the gene sequences from the _PROTEIN_ mutant with those from the wild type revealed a point mutation in one of these genes . the c to t mutation resulted in loss of a banii site in the gene . to confirm that the c to t mutation in was responsible for the phenotypes observed in the _PROTEIN_ mutant we transformed a kb genomic dna fragment containing the wild type gene into the _PROTEIN_ mutant and examined the phenotypes of the transgenic plants . it was found that the wild type gene completely rescued the _PROTEIN_ phenotypes including the fiber wall _PROTEIN_ and vessel morphology along with stem mechanical strength and plant growth . these results unequivocally demonstrate that the c to t mutation in the gene is responsible for the _PROTEIN_ mutant phenotypes therefore represents the _PROTEIN_ gene . to perform molecular characterization of the _PROTEIN_ gene we isolated the full length _PROTEIN_ cdna . comparison of the sequences of _PROTEIN_ gene and its cdna revealed that the _PROTEIN_ gene consists of four exons and three introns with a length of bp from the start codon to the stop codon . the longest open reading frame in the _PROTEIN_ cdna is bp long and it encodes a protein of amino acid residues with a predicted molecular _METHOD_ of d and a predicted pi of . the _PROTEIN_ mutation occurred in the exon of the _PROTEIN_ gene . comparison of the wild type and _PROTEIN_ cdnas and their deduced amino acid sequences showed that the _PROTEIN_ missense mutation changes a pro codon cca to a leu codon cta . a search of the genbank conserved domain database revealed that the deduced _PROTEIN_ protein contains a domain that shares significant sequence similarity with the domain . the domain was first defined based on the _PROTEIN_ domain of animal exostosins and putative _PROTEIN_ containing this domain are grouped as _PROTEIN_ family . in the arabidopsis genome genes including _PROTEIN_ have been identified as members of _PROTEIN_ family . of these the _GENE_ _PROTEIN_ and _GENE_ genes two putative orthologs of tobacco were thought to encode _PROTEIN_ involved in pectin synthesis and the _PROTEIN_ gene was proven to encode a xyloglucan galactosyltransferase . _PROTEIN_ together with a _PROTEIN_ homolog show the highest sequence similarity to tobacco and its putative arabidopsis orthologs _GENE_ and _GENE_ . identity and similarity of the conserved domains of _PROTEIN_ and other _PROTEIN_ family proteins the most significant sequence similarity among the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ family proteins and between arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ family proteins and animal exostosins resides within the _PROTEIN_ signature motif . the _PROTEIN_ missense mutation occurred at an amino acid residue pro within the _PROTEIN_ signature motif . it is noteworthy that the _PROTEIN_ signature motifs of _PROTEIN_ and its homolog _GENE_ show much higher sequence similarity with those of and its arabidopsis orthologs than with _PROTEIN_ . this is consistent with the phylogenetic data showing that _PROTEIN_ _GENE_ _GENE_ _GENE_ and are grouped as closely related members . in addition the pro residue that is mutated in _PROTEIN_ is completely conserved among _PROTEIN_ and and its arabidopsis orthologs but not among _PROTEIN_ and its homologs . these findings suggest that _PROTEIN_ and might share a similar _PROTEIN_ biochemical activity and that the pro residue is essential for their functions . to investigate the _PROTEIN_ pattern of the _PROTEIN_ gene we first used the semiquantitative rt pcr method to examine its _PROTEIN_ in various organs . it was found that although the _PROTEIN_ gene was _PROTEIN_ in all of the organs examined it showed the highest _PROTEIN_ in developing _METHOD_ and week old roots both of which had a large number of developing vessels and fibers . interestingly the _PROTEIN_ homolog _GENE_ was _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in seedlings young _METHOD_ and inflorescence apices . we next used the _PROTEIN_ reporter gene to examine the tissue level _PROTEIN_ pattern of the _PROTEIN_ gene . to do this we employed the kb genomic dna fragment containing the wild type _PROTEIN_ gene that was used for the complementation study . because this genomic dna fragment was sufficient to complement the _PROTEIN_ mutant phenotypes it should contain all elements responsible for the _PROTEIN_ of the endogenous _PROTEIN_ gene . the gus reporter gene was inserted in frame just before the stop codon of the _PROTEIN_ gene in a binary vector to create the _PROTEIN_ gus construct . transformation of this construct into the _PROTEIN_ mutant plants completely rescued the mutant phenotypes . examination of gus activity in the inflorescence _METHOD_ of the transgenic plants revealed that in early elongating internodes where no interfascicular fibers were visible the gus signals were only present in developing xylem but absent in interfascicular regions . in internodes near cessation of elongation when fiber cells are clearly visible and in nonelongating internodes in which fiber cells undergo _METHOD_ secondary wall deposition the gus staining was intensive in both interfascicular fibers and developing xylem cells . in mature internodes in which interfascicular fibers had _PROTEIN_ secondary walls little gus staining was seen in interfascicular fibers . however intensive gus staining was still present in developing xylem cells but absent in mature ones . a similar gus _PROTEIN_ pattern was also observed in roots that underwent secondary growth . the gus staining was evident only in developing root xylem cells but absent in mature ones . in the seedling stage the gus staining was confined in the vascular strands of roots cotyledons hypocotyls and leaves . these results demonstrate that the _PROTEIN_ gene is specifically _PROTEIN_ in cells undergoing secondary wall deposition . the tight association of _PROTEIN_ gene _PROTEIN_ with secondary wall synthesis in fibers and vessels is consistent with the defective fiber and vessel phenotypes seen in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . sequence analysis using the program for prediction of transmembrane helices in proteins predicted that _PROTEIN_ is a type ii _LOCATION_ protein that contains a short cytoplasmic n terminus followed by a single transmembrane helix and a long noncytoplasmic c terminus . further sequence analysis predicted _PROTEIN_ to be a _LOCATION_ localized protein using the _LOCATION_ predictor program . to determine the actual subcellular location of _PROTEIN_ we _PROTEIN_ green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis plants . examination of the root cells of the transgenic plants showed that the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signal displayed a punctate pattern whereas the _METHOD_ control protein had signals throughout the cytoplasm and the _LOCATION_ . this observation indicates that _PROTEIN_ is targeted to certain subcellular organelles . to discern the exact subcellular location of _PROTEIN_ we performed colocalization experiments in carrot protoplasts . as with the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis root cells enhanced cyan _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ exhibited a punctate localization pattern in carrot protoplasts . colocalization experiments revealed that the pattern of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was identical to that of enhanced yellow _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ a udp d xylose epimerase previously shown to be localized in _LOCATION_ . the _METHOD_ control protein was seen to be distributed throughout the cytoplasm and the _LOCATION_ . together these results demonstrate that _PROTEIN_ is a _LOCATION_ localized protein . because _PROTEIN_ is a member of _PROTEIN_ family and it is localized in _LOCATION_ we reasoned that _PROTEIN_ may be involved in the biosynthesis of a noncellulosic polysaccharide in the cell wall . to ascertain whether the _PROTEIN_ mutation caused an overall reduction in cell wall synthesis or a specific effect on the synthesis of a particular polysaccharide we examined the neutral sugar composition of cell walls isolated from _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . this analysis revealed that xylose and _PROTEIN_ which are the _PROTEIN_ components of xylan and cellulose respectively were profoundly affected in _PROTEIN_ . the amount of cell wall xylose and _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was reduced by and respectively compared with the wild type . by contrast the amount of several other wall neutral sugars including mannose galactose and arabinose was significantly increased in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . neutral monosaccharide composition of cell walls from the _METHOD_ of wild type and _PROTEIN_ plants in order to determine which specific cell wall polysaccharides are affected by the _PROTEIN_ mutation we isolated individual polysaccharide fractions for compositional analysis . cell walls in the form of alcohol insoluble residues were prepared from the _METHOD_ of wild type and _PROTEIN_ plants and they were subjected to sequential extraction with specific polysaccharide cleaving enzymes and chemical reagents that disrupt the cell wall yielding five water soluble fractions plus cellulose . these fractions in turn were subjected to glycosyl composition analysis using techniques that permit the quantitation of both neutral and acidic monosaccharides . as shown in table the overall monosaccharide yields were lower for the _PROTEIN_ mutant than for the wild type . enzyme extracted fractions were obtained by treatment with endo polygalacturonase to generate the pectin fraction and subsequent treatment with a xyloglucan specific endo _PROTEIN_ to generate the xeg fraction . although these enzyme extracted fractions constitute a greater portion of the cell wall in _PROTEIN_ plants than in wild type plants the ratios of individual monosaccharides within these two fractions are not significantly different when _PROTEIN_ and wild type cell walls are compared . glycosyl compositions of fractions from wild type and _PROTEIN_ cell walls xyl glca and o me glca are the _PROTEIN_ components of xylans which are a major component of the and n koh extracted fractions . it was found that the xyl content of the and n koh fractions extracted from _PROTEIN_ walls was _PROTEIN_ to and respectively of the wild type amounts and the glca content of these fractions was < of the wild type amounts . interestingly the ratio of o me glca to xyl was higher in _PROTEIN_ than in the wild type . the amount of xyl that remained associated in the cell wall after the koh extraction was also reduced in the _PROTEIN_ mutant in comparison with the wild type . the _PROTEIN_ mutation did not lead to any apparent reduction in the base extractability of xylan as this would lead to an increase in the xylose content of the trifluoroacetic acid fraction or the residual cellulose fraction but this was not observed . in addition the cellulose content of the _PROTEIN_ cell walls was drastically reduced compared with that of wild type walls . of the _PROTEIN_ family enzymes whose specific biochemical function is supported by experimental evidence the one most closely related to _PROTEIN_ is . based on sequence homology to exostosins and the _PROTEIN_ that mutation of the gene causes a _PROTEIN_ in the glca content of a complex pectic polysaccharide known as rgii it was concluded that encodes a pectin _PROTEIN_ . mutation of also leads to observable cell wall abnormalities that are likely to stem from a _PROTEIN_ capacity of the modified rgii to dimerize via the formation of borate diester cross links . the _PROTEIN_ that the _PROTEIN_ mutation has no significant effect on the glca content of the pectin fraction makes it unlikely that _PROTEIN_ is a _PROTEIN_ involved in pectin biosynthesis . however in order to rule out the possibility that _PROTEIN_ and have the same activity and that the _PROTEIN_ phenotype is due to a change in rgii structure the dimerization of rgii from _PROTEIN_ and wild type cell walls was analyzed chromatographically . figure shows the _PROTEIN_ components of the pectin fractions obtained from the wild type and _PROTEIN_ mutant cell walls separated by size exclusion chromatography . the rgii dimer was significantly more abundant than the monomer in the pectic fractions from both wild type and _PROTEIN_ plants . treatment of either pectin fraction with n hcl which hydrolyzes the rgii dimer to the monomer form produced the same effect in both cases confirming the identity of the rgii dimer peak . these results demonstrate that the _PROTEIN_ mutation has no effect on rgii dimerization indicating that _PROTEIN_ and have distinct biochemical activities . they also suggest that the physiological effects of the _PROTEIN_ mutation have a different origin than those observed when the gene is mutated in tobacco . we also analyzed the structure of xyloglucan oligosaccharides isolated from the xeg extracted fraction from the cell walls of _PROTEIN_ and wild type plants . _PROTEIN_ assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight and nmr analyses of these oligosaccharides showed no significant structural differences . as the _PROTEIN_ mutation has significant effects on the xyl and glca content of the cell wall the xylose rich and n koh fractions from the cell walls of the wild type _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ plants complemented with the wild type _PROTEIN_ gene were analyzed . xyloglucan and xylan are released from the cell wall with and n koh and both polymers contain high amounts of xylose . to identify the polysaccharide responsible for the observed loss of xylose these fractions were incubated with a endoxylanase which digests _PROTEIN_ but is not able to degrade xyloglucan as confirmed by our experiments . the resulting digestion products were separated by size exclusion chromatography . endoxylanase treatment converted of the and n koh fractions from wild type _METHOD_ into oligosaccharides . by contrast this treatment of the and n koh fractions from _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ converted only and respectively of these samples into oligosaccharides . the undigested materials were identified by nmr as _PROTEIN_ xyloglucan . the acidic oligosaccharides produced by digestion were partially purified and analyzed by maldi tof _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ as described in the next paragraph . neutral xylan oligosaccharide products were also detected . the yields of both the acidic and neutral oligosaccharides were lower when _PROTEIN_ extracts were digested than when wild type extracts were digested . analysis of the and n koh fractions gave similar results and only the spectra of the oligosaccharides from the n koh fraction are presented . the most abundant ions in the spectra of all acidic xylan oligosaccharide fractions occur at _METHOD_ to charge ratios and a series with an incremental _METHOD_ of d which is consistent with the sequential addition of a pentosyl residue to the oligosaccharide . these fractions are rich in xyl and contain very little ara indicating that this pentosyl residue is xyl . therefore this series of ions was attributed to oligosaccharides with four five and six xyl residues substituted with one o me glca . the ions at m/z and were attributed to the doubly sodiated species of the same series of oligosaccharides . assignment of these ions was supported by observation of the same series of ions in the maldi tof spectrum of oligosaccharides obtained by endoxylanase digestion of a o methyl _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ from sigma aldrich . this commercially available polysaccharide has a backbone of linked d xylp residues some of which are substituted at o with o me d glcpa residues . comparison of the spectra of the wild type and _PROTEIN_ showed no alteration in the abundance of ions at m/z and indicating that the _PROTEIN_ mutation does not affect the addition of o me glca onto xylan . another series of ions at m/z and also showed a _METHOD_ increment of d with a difference of d relative to the xnm series . these ions were attributed to oligosaccharides with four five and six xyl residues substituted with one glca . the spectrum for the _PROTEIN_ mutant showed a drastic reduction in the abundance of these ions compared with the wild type indicating that the _PROTEIN_ mutation causes a specific defect in the addition of glca onto xylan . xylan oligosaccharide fractions obtained from the _PROTEIN_ mutant complemented with the wild type _PROTEIN_ gene gave maldi tof spectra similar to the wild type with high abundance ions in the xng series confirming that the defect in the addition of glca onto xylan in the mutant is caused by mutation of the _PROTEIN_ gene . to further prove the structural defect of xylan in the _PROTEIN_ mutant nmr spectra of the purified xylan oligosaccharides obtained from the cell walls of wild type _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ complemented plants were recorded . all the spectra included anomeric resonances at and characteristic for the and configurations respectively of the reducing d xylp residue . in the spectrum of the oligosaccharides from wild type plants two additional anomeric resonances were attributed to d glcpa and o me d glcpa residues respectively in _PROTEIN_ oligosaccharides . the scalar coupling of hz for these h signals indicates an configuration consistent with this assignment . two other diagnostic resonances were assigned to h of d glcpa and o me d glcpa residues respectively . substitution of d xylp residues with an d glcpa or o me d glcpa residue caused an downfield shift of h from to to and respectively . the resonances assigned to o me d glcpa residues and d xylp residues with a o me d glcpa residue at o were present in the nmr spectrum of the oligosaccharides obtained by digestion of the commercial o methyl _PROTEIN_ . however the nmr spectra of the oligosaccharides from this commercial source did not contain resonances assigned to d glcpa residues or d xylp residues with an d glcpa residue at o . the nmr assignments were realized by comparison with the data in the literature for sorghum _PROTEIN_ and rigorously confirmed by two dimensional nmr experiments . these experiments also established o of the d xylp residues as the location of the d glcpa and o me d glcpa substituents as previously reported for other acidic xylans . examination of the nmr spectra of the acidic xylan oligosaccharides from _PROTEIN_ and wild type plants showed that the wild type and _PROTEIN_ contain similar resonances assigned to h and h of o me d glcpa residues and to h of unbranched d xylp residues and d xylp residues substituted at o with o me d glcpa . by contrast whereas resonances assigned to h and h of d glcpa residues and to h of d xylp residues substituted with d glcpa are evident in the spectrum of the wild type oligosaccharides they are virtually absent in _PROTEIN_ . complementation of the _PROTEIN_ mutant with the wild type _PROTEIN_ gene resulted in the production of acidic xylan oligosaccharides with an nmr spectrum similar to the wild type in which the resonances diagnostic for the presence of d glcpa residues are restored . these spectroscopic results lead to the following conclusions . acidic xylans in the _METHOD_ of wild type arabidopsis plants contain both d glcpa and o me d glcpa residues with the latter being the most abundant . acidic xylans in the _METHOD_ of _PROTEIN_ plants retain o me d glcpa residues but are practically devoid of d glcpa residues . complementation of _PROTEIN_ plants with the wild type _PROTEIN_ gene restores the production of acidic xylans containing both d glcpa and o me d glcpa residues .
