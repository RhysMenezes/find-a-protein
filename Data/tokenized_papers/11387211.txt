plants contain a novel unique subfamily of rho _PROTEIN_ vital components of cellular signalling networks . here we report a general role for some members of this family in _PROTEIN_ plant growth processes . we show that arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ encode functional _PROTEIN_ with similar intrinsic _PROTEIN_ hydrolysis rates . we localized atrop proteins in root meristem cells to the and cell plate _LOCATION_ . _PROTEIN_ localization of atrops in trichoblasts specifies the growth sites for emerging root hairs . these sites were visible before budding and elongation of the arabidopsis root hair when atrops accumulated at their tips . _PROTEIN_ of constitutively active _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutant proteins in root hairs of transgenic arabidopsis plants abolished _PROTEIN_ growth and delocalized the gradient . _PROTEIN_ localization of atrops was inhibited by brefeldin a but not by other drugs such as latrunculin b cytochalasin d or caffeine . our results demonstrate a general function of atrop _PROTEIN_ in tip growth and in _PROTEIN_ diffuse growth .
_PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ belong to the rop group of rho _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are identical and from the presence of caax isoprenylation motifs are substrates for geranylation . to determine the intrinsic _PROTEIN_ hydrolysis rates arabidopsis cdnas corresponding to _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and a _PROTEIN_ were cloned in a pgex vector to obtain the corresponding glutathione _PROTEIN_ fusion proteins . the sequence is derived from an arabidopsis cdna library but is absent from the completed arabidopsis genome . the sequence was not detected in genomic southern hybridization suggesting that it is not an arabidopsis clone . both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were used in filter binding assays to allow for determination of the relative contribution of intrinsic _PROTEIN_ hydrolysis and _PROTEIN_ gdp dissociation . the _PROTEIN_ gdp off rates for the plant rho _PROTEIN_ were found to be low relative to _PROTEIN_ hydrolysis as shown by the different kinetics of loss of label for and _PROTEIN_ respectively . the _PROTEIN_ gdp off rate for _PROTEIN_ was higher than for _PROTEIN_ . both rop _PROTEIN_ had similar intrinsic _PROTEIN_ hydrolysis rates of and respectively . a constitutively active mutant _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ had no measurable _PROTEIN_ hydrolysis . the different _PROTEIN_ activities of _PROTEIN_ and protein reflected the functional difference from the rop _PROTEIN_ whereas the similar rates of _PROTEIN_ hydrolysis for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ suggested a high degree of functional conservation between these rop genes . to study the localization of _PROTEIN_ in the living cell the tagged green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ rho _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ in stably transformed tobacco cells using the gvg system . _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was predominantly localized to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ especially to the and cell plate _LOCATION_ with occasional localization in vesicles . a fraction of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was localized in the cytoplasm as indicated by a diffuse staining of the cytoplasmic strands and the region surrounding the _LOCATION_ . in contrast control _METHOD_ accumulated in the _LOCATION_ and showed a diffuse labelling of the cytoplasm without _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ staining . using _METHOD_ monoclonal antibodies _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion protein of the predicted size could be immunoprecipitated from a cell extract of the transgenic line with some evidence of protein degradation . to determine the localization of endogenous rop _PROTEIN_ antiserum was raised against _PROTEIN_ and tested using the transgenic culture . _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion protein was detected using the anti serum . in addition the antibody was effective in specifically immunoprecipitating _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion protein from whole cell extract . longer exposures revealed one additional band of the right size for endogenous tobacco rop proteins . endogenous arabidopsis rop proteins were also detected specifically in immunoprecipitates from whole seedling extracts . due to the high homology of the different rop proteins the _PROTEIN_ antibody is likely to be reactive against all rop _METHOD_ . root hair elongation is an example of tip growth in plants and shares many similarities with growing pollen tubes . to determine a possible role for rop _PROTEIN_ in root hair formation and probably of other root cells as well the antiserum against _PROTEIN_ was used for immunolocalization in arabidopsis seedlings . rop _PROTEIN_ were highly enriched in the basal and apical _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ in cells of the division zone of the primary root and in the cell _LOCATION_ of _PROTEIN_ root primordia . in the cell elongation zone atrop proteins were found to be _PROTEIN_ localized in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ of the trichoblast cell files before the root hair bulges became visible . in the differentiation zone of the root atrop proteins remained concentrated in the apical _LOCATION_ of root hair bulges and at tips of growing root hairs but were absent from the apical _LOCATION_ of fully grown root hairs from the older zone of the root . to find the requirements for _PROTEIN_ localization of atrop proteins on the trichoblast _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ we tested several inhibitors of root hair tip growth . drugs latrunculin b and cytochalasin d did not inhibit the early _PROTEIN_ localization of atrop proteins in trichoblasts in agreement with the reported lack of effect of these drugs on root hair initiation . likewise drugs propyzamide and colchicine did not affect the _PROTEIN_ localization of atrop proteins at the early stage . also caffeine had no effect on early atrop protein localization in agreement with the reported lack of effect of channel blocker verapamil on root hair budding . however brefeldin a a pharmacological inhibitor of _PROTEIN_ guanine nucleotide exchange activity was effective in inhibiting _PROTEIN_ localization of rop in trichoblast cell files . only four of samples contained roots with occasional rop spots left at wrong positions in the trichoblast _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ or showed incomplete inhibition of localization as shown in fig ref . a difference in atrop protein contents of trichoblasts and atrichoblasts was visible which might be caused by atrop gene _PROTEIN_ . bfa also inhibited localization of atrop proteins in the transverse _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ in the cell division zone of the root . washing away bfa reversibly allowed the relocalization of atrop proteins to the bud sites sometimes with trichoblasts having spots at wrong positions . this recovery could be observed after min and was insensitive to latrunculin b confirming that early _PROTEIN_ localization of rop _PROTEIN_ is independent of the actin _LOCATION_ . to determine a role for arabidopsis rop _PROTEIN_ in root hair formation transgenic arabidopsis lines were generated that inducibly _PROTEIN_ constitutively active and _METHOD_ of _METHOD_ rop _PROTEIN_ . in addition transgenic lines were made that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fused to the amino acids of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . the gvg system was used to avoid gene silencing or toxic effects associated with constitutive atrop _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . different transgenic lines _PROTEIN_ variable quantities of inducible _METHOD_ fusion protein mostly with low levels in the stem and leaves relatively strong labelling of guard cells and trichomes high levels in roots but not in root meristem . _PROTEIN_ in pollen tubes was absent precluding determination of a role for these rop _PROTEIN_ in pollen tube tip growth . to circumvent possible phenotypes caused by _PROTEIN_ of transcriptional activator gvg alone multiple lines were screened for each construct allowing the identification of specific phenotypes . seedlings _PROTEIN_ the constitutively active _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutant showed strong swelling of the epidermal cells of the hypocotyl and cotyledons concomitant with loss of tip growth in three lines . swollen epidermal cells were always green _METHOD_ indicating that the swelling was caused by _PROTEIN_ of the _METHOD_ fusion protein in individual cells . in five transgenic lines showing green _METHOD_ root hairs both constitutively active _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ caused loss of tip growth resulting in root hair swelling . the _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ rop in most lines was patchy and in such lines _PROTEIN_ constitutively active rop only _METHOD_ root hair cells were swollen while root hairs developed normally . the occurrence of the root hair phenotype was associated with an increase in diameter of the root elongation zone . mature epidermal root cells were not affected suggesting that the phenotype was specific for elongating cells . the finished bulges were found to contain extensive actin and tubulin _LOCATION_ . long actin bundles were present with a arrangement of finer filaments . microtubules were more randomly oriented and shorter than microtubules in mature root hairs or root epidermal cells possibly as a consequence of isotropic growth . swollen epidermal cells of the hypocotyl and swollen root hairs were not observed in arabidopsis seedlings nor in induced transgenic lines _PROTEIN_ either _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ or _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ tail . the phenotype was reproducible in and generations . the experiment indicated that cell swelling was specific for constitutively activated rop and thus pointed to an important role for rop _PROTEIN_ in root hair tip growth and also in elongation of epidermal cells of the hypocotyl . to study gradients in and mutant root hairs we microinjected root hairs with for confocal ratio imaging . in root hairs and in uninduced _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ roots a gradient was first visible after early bulge formation and disappeared at the end of tip growth . early trichoblasts from induced seedlings had low levels similar to the uninduced control . swelling root hairs from induced _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ roots had delocalized gradients focused on where growth was occurring . delocalization of the gradient could already be observed at the early stage of tip growth . _METHOD_ fusion protein was evenly distributed over the trichoblast _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and did not colocalize with the gradient . also _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in root cortical cells did not result in higher levels indicating that _PROTEIN_ rop is not sufficient to generate high .
_PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and ests were obtained from the arabidopsis biological resource center . _PROTEIN_ cdna was isolated from an arabidopsis cdna library . mutations were made in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and in _PROTEIN_ . inserts mutant inserts and an _PROTEIN_ fragment corresponding to the amino acids were obtained by pcr using pfu polymerase . pcr products were cloned into the ecori and sali sites of pbluescript ii sk and sequenced to confirm the presence of desired mutations and the absence of pcr _LOCATION_ . rho _PROTEIN_ cdna inserts were directionally cloned behind the _METHOD_ open reading frame of a modified version of _METHOD_ . _METHOD_ has a plant _PROTEIN_ cassette containing the camv promoter with a duplicated transcriptional enhancer a tobacco etch virus translational enhancer a _METHOD_ orf with additional and mutations and no stop codon and at the end the camv polyadenylation signal . pbluescript rho pcr clones were cut with bamhi sali and the inserts were cloned into the bamhi xbai sites of _METHOD_ . xhoi hindiii blunt fragments lacking the enhanced camv promoter were directionally cloned into the xhoi spei blunt sites of which allows _PROTEIN_ . small _PROTEIN_ cdnas were cloned into . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ fusion proteins were purified from escherichia coli strain and _PROTEIN_ assays were carried out using a preloading step with _PROTEIN_ . growth of tobacco cells was according to nagata et al . and transformation was performed using agrobacterium strain . transformants were on medium containing dexamethasone and allowed to grow for h. calli _PROTEIN_ inducible _METHOD_ fusion proteins were identified using _METHOD_ microscopy . _METHOD_ calli were transferred to liquid medium with selection and grown as cell suspensions . arabidopsis transgenic plants were obtained using transformation . to observe root hair phenotypes _METHOD_ rop fusion proteins were induced by growing seedlings in medium containing _METHOD_ salts sucrose and vitamins and dexamethasone for h. rabbit antisera were raised against bacterial _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ antigen and affinity purified using _PROTEIN_ protein . suspension cultures of transgenic lines were induced with dexamethasone for h. cells were pelleted resuspended in buffer a _PROTEIN_ sonicated on ice and then centrifuged at g for min at . _METHOD_ monoclonal antibodies were added to the supernatant immune complexes were bound to protein g agarose beads and analysed by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and western blotting according to standard procedures . blots were incubated with antibody or with a polyclonal _METHOD_ antibody protein a followed by antigen detection using a chemiluminescent substrate . _PROTEIN_ antiserum was used in a similar way but using protein a agarose beads . whole mount _METHOD_ staining of arabidopsis seedlings was performed according to et al . . _METHOD_ detection of actin and tubulin in arabidopsis seedlings was performed using the procedure according to braun et al . . root cells were microinjected with the _METHOD_ dye conjugated to a kda dextran and was monitored by confocal ratio imaging according to wymer et al . . when roots were induced with dexamethasone only cells showing _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ were used in subsequent microinjection and measurements . in situ calibration using ionophore and a range of bapta buffers indicated that the responsiveness of to changes in was unchanged in the _METHOD_ cells .
