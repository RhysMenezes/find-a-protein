four hundred and fifty eight genes coding for pentatricopeptide repeat _PROTEIN_ proteins are annotated in the arabidopsis thaliana genome . over the past years numerous reports have shown that many of these proteins function in organelles to target specific transcripts and are involved in post transcriptional regulation . therefore they are thought to be important players in the coordination between _LOCATION_ and organelle genome _PROTEIN_ . only four of these proteins have been described to be addressed outside organelles indicating that some _PROTEIN_ could function in post transcriptional regulations of _LOCATION_ genes . in this work we updated and improved our current knowledge on the localization of _PROTEIN_ proteins of arabidopsis within the plant cell . we particularly investigated the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ proteins whose targeting predictions were ambiguous using a combination of high throughput cloning and microscopy . through systematic localization experiments and data integration we confirmed that _PROTEIN_ proteins are largely targeted to organelles and showed that dual targeting to both the mitochondria and _LOCATION_ occurs more frequently than expected . these results allow us to speculate that dual targeted _PROTEIN_ proteins could be important for the fine coordination of gene _PROTEIN_ in both organelles .
we previously published a manually curated list of arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ gene when this work was initiated the most accurate _METHOD_ to predict subcellular localization of plant proteins were targetp and predotar therefore we used them to identify arabidopsis genes coding for _PROTEIN_ proteins with ambiguous localization predictions . targetp was recently improved with the targetp version of the software . among the _PROTEIN_ genes predotar predicts that and _PROTEIN_ proteins are addressed respectively to mitochondria and _LOCATION_ whereas _PROTEIN_ would not have any organelle localization . targetp gives similar results with and _PROTEIN_ localized to mitochondria and _LOCATION_ respectively and _PROTEIN_ without organelle localizations . taken together _PROTEIN_ proteins were predicted not to be addressed to either of the two _PROTEIN_ plant organelles by at least one of the two software . among them _PROTEIN_ proteins were not predicted to be addressed in the organelles by both _METHOD_ . we chose to experimentally investigate the subcellular localization of those _PROTEIN_ proteins as they were good candidates to have atypical functions out of the organelles . manually curated arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ gene models were most of them are identical to tair gene models but models are different and are indicated with their atppr codes . predictions of localization using predotar and target p software are listed . experimental _METHOD_ signals observed in protoplasts _PROTEIN_ targeting peptide or full length protein fused to _METHOD_ are shown . two independent observations by two of the authors were done on at least three independent agro infiltrations . for each _PROTEIN_ a tentative conclusion is proposed with the following rules if available the

extremity which is cleaved during the transfer through the organelle _LOCATION_ a mitochondrial targeting peptide is typically amino acid whereas a chloroplast targeting peptide is usually up to amino acid to assess the targeting peptide functionality we systematically merged in frame the first bp coding for the first amino acids of each candidate _PROTEIN_ orfs to the red _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ coding sequence using the gateway technology . the aim of this approach was to experimentally detect any mtp or ctp present in the first amino acids but not recognized by the prediction software . vector cloning based on gateway recombination technology was successful for genes . after agro infiltration of nicotiana benthamania leaves with these constructs and subsequent protoplasts preparation we were able to detect _METHOD_ signals for constructs using either _METHOD_ or confocal microscope . all localization experiments were repeated at least three times and observed independently by two of the authors . summarizes all predicted and experimental data obtained during this study . presented in are examples of typical subcellular localizations observed using bp constructs . in _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was visualized using a confocal microscope and compared with the distribution of the _LOCATION_ specific probe mitotracker green and the chlorophyll _METHOD_ . in the overlay panels combined _METHOD_ from _METHOD_ mitotracker and chlorophyll autofluorecence appears in yellow when _METHOD_ signal co localizes with mitotracker staining indicating a localization of the fusion protein in mitochondria whereas it appears in violet when _METHOD_ signal is localized in _LOCATION_ . it was detected that and bp _PROTEIN_ constructs gave an exclusive mitochondrial and _LOCATION_ localization respectively as exemplified by _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in . interestingly constructs exhibited a signal in both organelles _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and nine constructs gave localizations out of organelles appearing as typical _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ signals _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . these localization results in the _LOCATION_ and the _LOCATION_ of the protoplasts suggest that the first amino acids of these proteins do not code for a functional peptide targeting to organelles and that the _METHOD_ fusion proteins are localized where the translation occurs _LOCATION_ and in the _LOCATION_ by passive diffusion of small proteins through _LOCATION_ pores . figure . examples of typical sub cellular localizations observed using confocal microscopy . confocal images of protoplasts obtained from

investigate in more detail the subcellular localization of the _PROTEIN_ proteins that did not show a simple single organellar localization . out of the _PROTEIN_ proteins localized in both organelles and the nine proteins appearing outside of the organelles we successfully cloned the whole orfs and created _METHOD_ fusions for . subcellular localizations of these fusions were monitored using agro infiltrated n. benthamiana derived protoplasts observed under _METHOD_ and confocal microscope . results are summarized in . we confirmed the dual subcellular localization for six out of the orfs successfully _PROTEIN_ and encoding full length proteins thought to be addressed in both organelles _PROTEIN_ . as for _PROTEIN_ we showed a single localization in mitochondria for the other five . among the nine _PROTEIN_ proteins thought to be out of the organelles on the base of the first amino acids seven orfs were successfully cloned but no _LOCATION_ localization was confirmed the whole proteins fused to _METHOD_ were systematically addressed to one or both organelles as exemplified by _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in . surprisingly six of them were localized in both organelles _PROTEIN_ . altogether _PROTEIN_ proteins were verified as being localized in both mitochondria and _LOCATION_ using the full length protein . in order to provide a general overview of the localization of the whole _PROTEIN_ protein family we aggregated our results concerning one third of the family with all available data from published studies and accessible databases . we first re examined the localization prediction of the _PROTEIN_ proteins encoded in the arabidopsis genome using six available bio informatics prediction tools and despite using distinct _METHOD_ those tools largely provide similar results and gives a single localization prediction aggregating the six software results following a rule emphasized in the caption of . overall and of the _PROTEIN_ proteins are predicted to function in mitochondria and in _LOCATION_ respectively . for the results are unclear either because a majority of the software was unable to provide an organellar prediction or because they provide overmuch diverging organellar predictions . we also added the growing data coming from the proteomics identification of organelle proteins in arabidopsis mitochondria _PROTEIN_ and chloroplast _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ also including localization data obtained from maize chloroplast _PROTEIN_ and rice according to the recent concept of as a very good level of orthology observed between the members of _PROTEIN_ families in a. thaliana and oriza sativa suggests that both their function and their subcellular localization are largely conserved between species even between monocotyledons and dicotyledons . overall of the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ proteins or _PROTEIN_ orthologs in other species were identified either in the _LOCATION_ or the mitochondrial proteomes providing a very useful set of _PROTEIN_ protein localization data . three and five _PROTEIN_ proteins were identified during proteomics characterization of arabidopsis _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ proteins surprisingly _PROTEIN_ proteins were characterized in _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ or _LOCATION_ without functional characterization of any of these _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ proteins these observations can not be solved . they may be due to intrinsic technical limitations of proteomics approaches in contrast their number may indicate unsuspected localizations and functions . however proteome based localizations validate many of the prediction results of bio informatics software as of them matched the available predictions . in each cell of the table the number and the percent of compatible localizations among the intersection of data available in both data sets are indicated . two results are considered as compatible when their localizations are coherent for example experimental localization in both organelles and prediction or proteomics indicating only one of the two organelles . a growing number of _PROTEIN_ proteins were subjected to in planta functional characterization either in dedicated studies or in systematic studies including the work reported here and three previous data in _PROTEIN_ . authors usually characterized localizations by microscopy using fusions between _PROTEIN_ proteins or if suspected putative targeting peptides and a _METHOD_ reporter . including the work reported here _PROTEIN_ localizations were experimentally determined using _METHOD_ fusion proteins largely correlating with both bio informatics and proteomics approaches . among the _PROTEIN_ proteins for which both experimental localization data based on protein fusion and predictions using bio informatics tools are available have a similar localization . in addition among the _PROTEIN_ proteins being both identified in sub proteomes and subjected to experimental localization studies using _METHOD_ protein fusion were compatible . the last set of data comes from the identification of the molecular functions of _PROTEIN_ proteins using reverse genetics providing very important data about their localization . as largely reported in the literature _PROTEIN_ proteins are involved in regulating gene _PROTEIN_ by acting through direct interaction with specific rnas . a literature survey indicates that molecular roles were assigned to _PROTEIN_ proteins occurring in _LOCATION_ in mitochondria in both mitochondria and _LOCATION_ or in the _LOCATION_ . these reverse genetics studies are very strong statements of _PROTEIN_ localization which could be considered as true localization . when compared with this very high quality data set our data as well as all data of _METHOD_ protein localization appeared as very highly correlated with out of and out of compatible localization respectively . as concluded in and taking into account all the above depicted approaches we assigned all arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ proteins a probable localization depending on the strength of the available data . the localization based on reverse genetics when available prevailed over any other approaches . because we showed that the experimental localizations of fusion proteins were highly correlated with the localization of the molecular function when identified this data prevailed over the proteomics and bio informatics ones . additionally _PROTEIN_ protein identification in organellar proteomes though showing some discrepancies with functional data suggesting some _LOCATION_ of localization linked to this technique was as far as we know more trustable that bio informatics predictions . finally when no experimental data was available we proposed a predicted localization in mitochondria or chloroplast . gives a graphical view of these results . the number of _PROTEIN_ proteins with a suspected or proved subcellular localization in at least one of the two organelles increased significantly with our study . for example the experimental mitochondrial and chloroplast localization data increased by and with the addition _PROTEIN_ with experimental dual targeting to mitochondria and chloroplast to the previously known . overall _PROTEIN_ proteins are expected to function in mitochondria with of them being validated in experimental studies . additionally _PROTEIN_ proteins are expected to function in _LOCATION_ being demonstrated experimentally . forty five _PROTEIN_ proteins are suspected to have a dual addressing to both _LOCATION_ and mitochondria . finally five _PROTEIN_ proteins have been shown to have atypical localization and were shown to be addressed to the _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ to both _LOCATION_ and and _PROTEIN_ was observed in both _LOCATION_ and chloroplastic extracts during proteomics only _PROTEIN_ proteins do not have any clear localization based on experimental or bio informatics reported investigations . figure .
