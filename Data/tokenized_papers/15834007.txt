the _LOCATION_ genome of the moss physcomitrella patens contains two genes encoding phage type rna polymerases . each of the and transcripts possesses two in frame aug codons at the terminus that could act as a translational initiation site . observation of transient and stable physcomitrella transformants _PROTEIN_ the terminus of each pprpot cdna fused with the green _METHOD_ protein gene suggested that both and are not translated from the first aug codon in the natural context but translated from the second one and that these enzymes are targeted only to mitochondria although they are potentially targeted to _LOCATION_ when translation is forced to start from the first aug codon . the influence of the upstream sequence on the translation efficiency of the two aug codons in and was quantitatively assessed using a _PROTEIN_ reporter . the results further supported that the second aug codon is the sole translation initiation site in physcomitrella cells . an arabidopsis rpot homolog atrpot that possesses two initiation aug codons in its transcripts as do the rpots of p. patens has been _PROTEIN_ as a dually targeted protein . when the localization of atrpot was tested using green _METHOD_ protein in a similar way atrpot was also observed only in mitochondria in many arabidopsis tissues . these results suggest that despite the presence of two in frame augs at the termini of rpots in physcomitrella and arabidopsis the second aug is specifically recognized as the initiation site in these _METHOD_ resulting in _PROTEIN_ of a protein that is targeted to mitochondria . this finding may change the current framework of thinking about the transcription machinery of _LOCATION_ in land plants .
the cdna sequence for the two rpots in p. patens that we published previously showed a long sequence that preceded the conserved rpot coding sequence . some cdna sequences were also available in the _PROTEIN_ sequence tag database but all of them were mapped within the cdna sequences shown in figure . genomic sequences were published by citation and the comparison of cdna and genomic sequences indicated that the long sequence of was shared by the two except two terminal residues but that a short sequence fragment at the end of the genomic sequence of might be an intron sequence which ends by the consensus _PROTEIN_ . in other words the transcription starts from an exon further upstream whose genomic sequence is still not available . both of the cdnas are likely full length ones but the end was not mapped due to unavailability of upstream genomic sequences and the low level of transcripts in the total mrna pool . in both rpot sequences the long sequence contains two in frame _PROTEIN_ triplets . no further in frame _PROTEIN_ is present upstream of the conserved polymerase sequence . available sequence data indicate the transcript contains both aug codons . no splicing variant containing only one of the augs is known . therefore the mrna contains a long utr upstream of the first _PROTEIN_ in . the length of the utr of mrna is nucleotides . in addition the interval between the first _PROTEIN_ and the second _PROTEIN_ was and nucleotides respectively for and . in the atrpot sequence the utr is nucleotides long and the interval between the two _PROTEIN_ codons is nucleotides . we first tested if the two pprpots are present in the _LOCATION_ by immunoblot analysis and by measuring the sensitivity to tagetitoxin of the transcription in isolated mitochondria and _LOCATION_ of p. patens protonemata . tagetitoxin is known to inhibit transcription by _LOCATION_ encoded rna polymerase _PROTEIN_ and bacterial rna polymerase but not the activity of rpot . in p. patens the core of _PROTEIN_ consists of _LOCATION_ encoded subunits and a _LOCATION_ encoded subunit but is expected to be sensitive to tagetitoxin because its structure is analogous to that of bacterial rna polymerases . protonemata were used in these experiments because we already showed that the two pprpot genes are transcribed in the protonemata . first polyclonal antisera were raised against the glutathione s transferase _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ recombinant proteins . in these proteins the n terminal half of the protein sequence was used to avoid cross reaction due to the conserved c terminal active center domain . the cross reaction of these antibodies with the full length polymerase enzymes _PROTEIN_ was indeed undetectable and estimated to be less than . the two organelles were purified over percoll gradients and then tested by immunoblot analysis with anti or anti . an immunoreactive protein with a molecular _METHOD_ identical to that expected for or was detected in the mitochondrial fraction but not in the chloroplast fraction . control antibodies directed against known _LOCATION_ and mitochondrial proteins were also tested to confirm the purity of the two fractions . no significant cross contamination was found . these results suggest that both and proteins are localized in the mitochondria but not in the chloroplasts in the protonema . oligonucleotides used in this study underlines indicate restriction sites . the two pprpots were demonstrated to be functional rna polymerases in a previous study . the transcription activity of the two recombinant pprpot enzymes was not inhibited by tagetitoxin . in mitochondria the transcription was not inhibited by tagetitoxin or even stimulated to some extent . this result was just as expected because the two pprpots are present in the mitochondria as described above and no other type of rna polymerase is known to function in mitochondria of higher eukaryotes . in the _LOCATION_ the transcription was almost completely inhibited by the addition of tagetitoxin . in the in vitro transcription system using the proplastid nucleoids of tobacco by cells which contain an appreciable level of nep the residual transcription activity in the presence of tagetitoxin was ascribed to the activity of nep . in the _LOCATION_ of p. patens however there was no measurable level of tagetitoxin insensitive transcription activity . this is consistent with the results of immunoblot analysis that indicated the absence of rpot enzymes in the chloroplasts . if the rpots are _METHOD_ targeted to chloroplasts as reported by citation all these results are hard to explain . rather this is evidence that rpot enzymes or nep is absent in the _LOCATION_ of p. patens protonemata . next we reexamined targeting of _METHOD_ fusion proteins . the discrepancy in the targeting experiments as described in the introduction might be due to the constructs used in the two reports . in the experiments of citation translation was forced to start from the aug codon just downstream the translation leader sequence which was taken from tobacco etch virus . the native upstream sequence was not used in their targeting experiments . by contrast we used _METHOD_ fused constructs containing the native upstream sequences to investigate the situation in the natural translation context . thus the sequence context of the translational initiation site is a likely candidate for the discrepancy . since the nucleotide sequence context of the aug plays a role in the efficiency of translation initiation the upstream sequences of the first and second augs were compared . although the consensus sequence of the plant context is aaaaacaa aaug the sequence context of both the first and second aug were scarcely analogous to the consensus sequence and it was difficult to estimate functional initiation codon just by such sequence comparison . we therefore tried to obtain as much information as possible from the sequence database of p. patens . first all available protein encoding sequences were retrieved from the genbank database . then the nucleotides upstream of the initiation site were extracted from each entry . the information content of each site or sequencelogo was calculated for these utr sequences and is presented in figure . based on this statistic we deduced moss consensus as shown in the figure . the information content values were used as a weight _PROTEIN_ to calculate a score for each possible initiation site which we hoped would represent the probability of the initiation site . the result indicated that the score was higher for the second aug than for the first aug in both and . this is the first positive computational data suggesting that the second aug may be used preferentially . to reexamine the targeting of and by _METHOD_ we prepared several new _METHOD_ fusion constructs using both the natural upstream sequence and the translation leader sequence taken from the _PROTEIN_ gene of pea . in addition in _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ the second aug codon was mutated while the translation was forced to start from the first one . these constructs were introduced into moss protoplasts by polyethylene glycol mediated transformation . in the experiments with _METHOD_ the construct having the entire utr plus both met codons and constructs having only the second met codon _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ the _METHOD_ of _METHOD_ was localized to mitochondria whereas the _METHOD_ of _METHOD_ was localized to _LOCATION_ with the construct having a mutated second met codon _METHOD_ . in analogous constructs with the namely the construct having the entire utr _METHOD_ and the constructs having the second met codon _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was localized to mitochondria while the _METHOD_ of _METHOD_ was localized to _LOCATION_ with _METHOD_ . the _METHOD_ of _METHOD_ with the constructs having a translation leader that replaced the utr _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ was localized to both mitochondria and _LOCATION_ . these results indicate that forced translation from the first aug codon using the tl of pea _PROTEIN_ resulted in the localization to _LOCATION_ just as in the reported results with pol vector . however _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ with the natural upstream sequence were localized only to mitochondria . these results are explained if the first aug codon is not used as the translation initiation site in vivo although the amino acid sequence beginning from it has a property of _LOCATION_ targeting sequence . no secondary structure such as stem loop is predicted in the upstream sequence of the two pprpots with the software rnastructure version . however some uorfs were detected in the utr . we examined the influence of the upstream sequence on the translation efficiency with _METHOD_ fusion constructs _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . the results suggest that the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ of _METHOD_ was localized to mitochondria . the _METHOD_ of _METHOD_ was localized to both mitochondria and _LOCATION_ . in the experiment with _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was observed in mitochondria as in the case of _METHOD_ containing the full length upstream sequence of the first aug codon . these results suggest that the uorf has no effect on the translation efficiency of the first aug codon and that only the nucleotide sequence upstream of the first aug is necessary to suppress translation from this site . however this may not be suppression because not all augs within the mrna act as initiation codons . what can be concluded from this experiment is that the proximal nucleotide sequence but not the long utr sequence upstream is important to determine whether translation is started from this site of rpot mrna . to quantitate the effects of the upstream sequence on the translation from the first and the second augs of and five additional plasmids with _PROTEIN_ reporter were constructed and tested in transient _PROTEIN_ . these constructs contain either the upstream sequence of the first or the second aug codon or the tl from the pea _PROTEIN_ gene which were fused to the uida gene and driven by the cauliflower mosaic virus promoter . they were introduced into moss protoplasts by polyethylene glycol mediated transformation . one day after transformation gus activity was measured . two constructs gus and tl gus gave high levels of gus activity whereas the gus activity with gus was at a level of control . in contrast with constructs gus gave lower gus activity but this activity was significantly higher than the activity with gus and control . therefore it _METHOD_ that translation is initiated only at the second aug codon in both and . in other words the first aug codon is unlikely to be recognized as a translation initiation site . effects of the upstream sequences on translation efficiency gus activity in p. patens protoplasts that were transformed with respective plasmid is normalized with the coexpressed _METHOD_ . the gus values are _PROTEIN_ in arbitrary unit with setting the average values of _PROTEIN_ driven by the tl gus as . each value represents the average of three independent assays . n/a not applicable . in our transient _PROTEIN_ experiments both and were translated from the second aug codon and were only localized to mitochondria in the protoplasts . however the first aug codon could be used as an initiation site in some particular types of cells or tissues . to address this question we examined in detail the localization of and in various cell types and tissues in stably transformed moss . the pppmads _METHOD_ and pppmads _METHOD_ plasmids containing the natural upstream sequence of the first aug codon and n terminal sequence were used for the transformation . in all cell types and tissues of stably transformed p. patens including protonemata and gametophores _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was only observed in mitochondria but never in chloroplasts . when immunoblot analysis was performed with _LOCATION_ and mitochondria isolated from stably transformed p. patens protonemata the _METHOD_ fusion protein was detected in the mitochondrial fraction but not in the _LOCATION_ fraction . thus subcellular localization of the _METHOD_ fusion protein in stably transformed protonemata and other tissues was the same as that in transiently transformed protoplasts confirming that no detectable level of translation occurs from the first aug codon of and . it was concluded that the n terminal extension in each of the two pprpots beginning from the first aug codon is not translated in vivo . phylogenetic analysis of the rpot proteins suggested three major clusters with a relationship cluster iii . this result is essentially consistent with the structure of n terminal sequences cluster i is characterized by the conserved sequence block and mitochondrial localization . the conserved sequence block is not found in cluster iii which contained _LOCATION_ proteins . n terminal extension as well as the conserved sequence block are found in the sequences in cluster ii . however belongs to cluster ii but lacks n terminal extension . atrpot and nsrpot b have been shown to be dually targeted to both _LOCATION_ and mitochondria in experiments with _METHOD_ fusion proteins . immunological evidence suggested that wheat g is a mitochondrial rna polymerase but the _LOCATION_ localization was not tested with _METHOD_ . the localization of wheat c was not reported . we chose atrpot to test its targeting since the upstream sequence was not included in the _METHOD_ fusion constructs in the previous report . the sequence context of two augs was compared to the consensus sequence of plants aaaaacaa aaug . however both of the upstream sequences were not analogous to the consensus sequence . however a computer prediction of translation initiation site with the netstart program which is said to be specialized for arabidopsis suggested that atrpot is not translated from the first aug codon but is translated from the second one . analogous prediction data are presented for other plants but they might not be correctly predicted because of limitation of neural network prediction using the arabidopsis training data set . two plasmids were constructed . pbi atrpot _METHOD_ contained the upstream sequence of the first aug codon and coding sequence and pbi atrpot _METHOD_ contained the coding region and no native upstream sequence . these constructs were used to transform arabidopsis and then subcellular localization of the _METHOD_ fusion proteins was observed in cotyledon leaf and root . in the experiment with pbi atrpot _METHOD_ the _METHOD_ of _METHOD_ was localized to mitochondria . by contrast the _METHOD_ of atrpot _METHOD_ was observed in both mitochondria and _LOCATION_ . additionally we investigated into the localization of atrpot during the early stage of seedling development and during the deetiolation process because citation reported that the mutation of atrpot affected the light induced accumulation of several _LOCATION_ gene transcripts during early seedling development . however the _METHOD_ of atrpot _METHOD_ was not detected in _LOCATION_ under any conditions tested . these results are essentially equivalent to those of the in vivo targeting experiments of pprpots described above and suggest that atrpot may also contain a formal _LOCATION_ targeting sequence in its n terminus as in the case of the two pprpots .
