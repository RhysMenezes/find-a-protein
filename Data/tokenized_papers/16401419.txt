mechanosensitive _METHOD_ ion channels provide a mechanism for the perception of mechanical stimuli such as sound touch and osmotic pressure . the bacterial _METHOD_ ion channel _METHOD_ opens in response to increased _LOCATION_ tension and serves to protect against cellular lysis during osmotic downshock . _METHOD_ like proteins are found widely in bacterial and archaeal species and have also been identified in fission yeast and plants . none of the eukaryotic members of the family have yet been characterized .
a phylogenetic tree describing the relationship between selected _METHOD_ family members from _METHOD_ and plants is shown in citation . from escherichia coli prochlorococcus marinus chlamydomonas reinhardtii schizosaccaromyces pombe arabidopsis thaliana and oryza sativa we selected proteins that contain a _METHOD_ domain _PROTEIN_ according to the conserved domain database of the national center for biotechnology information citation . the ten arabidopsis _METHOD_ proteins fall into two clusters . _METHOD_ cluster with eukaryotic _METHOD_ like proteins from rice yeast and green algae . the other three _METHOD_ proteins _METHOD_ are the most similar to _METHOD_ and cluster with _METHOD_ like proteins from both prokaryotes and eukaryotes . _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ are closely related both to each other and to a rice protein provisionally named _METHOD_ . x ray crystallography of e. coli _METHOD_ revealed a homoheptameric ion channel wherein each monomer contributes three n terminal transmembrane helices to the pore forming domain . the c terminal domains interact to form a cytoplasmic structure thought to serve as a prefilter citation . sequence conserved among _METHOD_ family members includes the pore lining transmembrane domain _METHOD_ and the adjacent _METHOD_ family consensus sequence citation . _METHOD_ of two archaeal _METHOD_ like ion channels citation _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ all show sequence conservation in this region . functional studies have implicated a repeating sequence of glycines and alanines in in the regulation of the gating transition of _METHOD_ citation . the corresponding transmembrane domain in _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ is also rich in glycines and alanines . two leucine side chains within and are thought to generate a hydrophobic seal at the cytoplasmic entrance to the pore of _METHOD_ citation . in _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ is conserved and has undergone a conservative substitution to valine . the _METHOD_ family consensus sequence is partially conserved in _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ but its function is currently unknown . the sequence conservation between bacterial and plant members of the _METHOD_ family although limited suggested that _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ might function as _METHOD_ ion channels . to provide support for this hypothesis we used a well established assay for _METHOD_ ion channel activity in bacteria the osmotic shock assay citation . cells are grown in high salt and then diluted into low salt media survival of the ensuing hypo osmotic shock requires _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ . iptg inducible _PROTEIN_ vectors driving the production of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ were tested for rescue of the osmotic shock sensitivity of an e. coli strain lacking the three mechanosensitive ion channels _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ citation . as expected induction of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ is sufficient to restore hypo osmotic shock survival to . we also observed that _METHOD_ is capable of reproducibly rescuing the osmotic sensitivity of . transformation of the _METHOD_ gene into e. coli caused a severe growth defect and was not pursued further . these data are consistent with our model that _METHOD_ functions as a mechanosensitive ion channel . to provide further support for this model we made use of an assay developed by booth and colleagues citation . the assay relies on the nonspecific nature of _METHOD_ ion channels when opened they allow movement of ions in both directions across the _LOCATION_ . for wild type cells an osmotic downshock that occurs in low ph medium will lead to cytoplasmic acidification and result in cell death . if _METHOD_ is indeed functioning as a _METHOD_ ion channel in e. coli bacteria _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ should suffer cytoplasmic acidification when the downshock medium is acidic and no longer survive . we tested this prediction by growing _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ in high salt media and then diluting into low salt or high salt media both at ph . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ did not survive osmotic shock in ph medium . both strains survived dilution into ph iso osmotic medium indicating that downshock was required for loss of viability in acidic media . _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ are predicted to have a very similar structure comprising an n terminal chloroplast transit peptide citation five transmembrane helices citation and a c terminal cytoplasmic domain . the region of similarity to _METHOD_ shown in citation a is underlined _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ are identical at the amino acid level in this region and identical overall . the translational start codon predicted by the arabidopsis information resource for _METHOD_ is indicated by an asterisk . this start site would produce a protein with four transmembrane domains and an ambiguous subcellular localization . the translational start site codon used in our analyses is located bp upstream from this site and would produce a protein with an n terminus highly similar to that of _METHOD_ with five transmembrane domains and a strongly predicted chloroplast transit sequence . we were able to amplify and clone a cdna corresponding to the region between the two putative start codons and we have submitted a revised version of the _METHOD_ cdna annotation to tair . to begin to investigate the function of _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ we identified transgenic arabidopsis lines harboring insertions in _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and in _METHOD_ _METHOD_ in pools provided by the arabidopsis knockout facility at the university of wisconsin madison citation . both insertions are located in the last exon of the relevant gene . the border of the t dna insertion in _METHOD_ is at bp of the open reading frame whereas the border of the insertion in _METHOD_ is at bp . we were unable to amplify the border of the _METHOD_ insertion for sequencing . _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ mrna was detected at high levels in leaves inflorescences and roots by rt pcr in both wild type and _METHOD_ _METHOD_ double mutant plants . although _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ single mutants did not have an observable phenotype _METHOD_ _METHOD_ double mutant plants produced light green sectors on their leaves . the development of light green sectors was most dramatic in the cauline leaves of older plants but was also visible in rosette leaves except the first two or three true leaves . the presence of leaves with domains of different color or variegation has been described in a number of other mutants in arabidopsis citation . the variegated phenotype of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ plants was rescued by the introduction of transgenic _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ genomic fragments _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . in all other respects analyzed _METHOD_ _METHOD_ plants were wild type except for a partial infertility that is likely a result of a fragment of the gene present in the t dna construct and has been observed in a number of other insertion lines from the same facility citation . in support of this conclusion fertility was not improved by introduction of _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ . to investigate the cause of the variegation observed in _METHOD_ _METHOD_ plants we prepared plastic sections from cauline leaves of wild type and mutant plants . compared to wild type leaves _METHOD_ _METHOD_ mutant leaves show disruptions in cell arrangement and morphology as well as the overall leaf shape . leaf tissue in the mutant has larger air spaces between cells compared to the wild type and all cells including epidermal palisade and mesophyll cells are larger than in wild type leaves and appear misshapen . furthermore the leaf blade is _PROTEIN_ in the double mutant than in the wild type leaf . we did not observe evidence of increased cell death in _METHOD_ _METHOD_ mutants by trypan blue staining and conclude that the increased cell volume and air spaces evident in these sections are responsible for the variegation observed in _METHOD_ _METHOD_ leaves . because a number of previously characterized variegation mutants harbor lesions in _LOCATION_ genes that function in chloroplast development or metabolism citation we investigated the morphology of chloroplasts in _METHOD_ _METHOD_ mutants . chloroplasts enlarged to various extents were observed in mesophyll cells of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ leaves . some mesophyll cells from double mutant leaves are larger than those from wild type leaves as observed above . in _METHOD_ _METHOD_ approximately of the mesophyll cells of _PROTEIN_ cauline leaves contained enlarged chloroplasts whereas no abnormal chloroplasts were observed in leaves from wild type plants or single mutants . _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ genomic fragments were able to rescue this phenotype because only of the mesophyll cells contained enlarged chloroplasts in lines carrying _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ . transmission electron microscopy was performed to characterize the ultrastructure of the enlarged chloroplasts observed in the double mutant . as illustrated in citation c the enlarged chloroplasts found in the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ mutant developed properly with normal levels of _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ starch granules and _LOCATION_ . in the right panel one normally sized and one greatly enlarged chloroplast can be seen in a section through a palisade cell from a _METHOD_ _METHOD_ mutant . the ruffled lumpy appearance of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ was typical of the largest of the chloroplasts we observed _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . _LOCATION_ are semi independent endosymbiotic organelles present in almost every cell of the plant responsible not just for photosynthesis but for a number of metabolic reactions and processes that include fatty acid and amino acid synthesis starch production and storage and gravity perception citation . small undifferentiated proplastids develop into specialized versions such as chloroplasts chromoplasts amyloplasts and other nongreen _LOCATION_ in response to developmental and environmental signals . we therefore asked whether the morphological defects observed in the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ mutant might also be observed in other _LOCATION_ . to visualize nongreen _LOCATION_ we constructed the _LOCATION_ stroma localized dsred marker precared citation and introduced it into wild type and _METHOD_ _METHOD_ plants . wild type and mutant plants harboring precared were examined by confocal laser scanning microscopy . precared _METHOD_ was detected in mesophyll chloroplasts of wild type and _METHOD_ _METHOD_ plants showing that the marker is properly targeted to _LOCATION_ and confirming the presence of enlarged chloroplasts in the double mutant . in wild type plants _LOCATION_ found in the pavement cells of the leaf epidermis were small and lens shaped . these _LOCATION_ occasionally exhibited stromules dynamic tubular extensions of unknown function citation . in _METHOD_ _METHOD_ cells the _LOCATION_ of the pavement cells of the leaf epidermis were much larger than those seen in wild type pavement cells . furthermore these enlarged _LOCATION_ appeared spherical with no observable stromules or other surface disruptions . almost all of the _LOCATION_ in the epidermis of mutant leaves and cotyledons analyzed had this abnormal morphology and normally shaped _LOCATION_ were rarely observed . the _LOCATION_ of the root epidermis of wild type plants had an appearance similar to those in the leaf whereas in the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ root _LOCATION_ again appeared round and enlarged . occasionally normally shaped _LOCATION_ were also observed in the same cell . cells containing _LOCATION_ with long tangled stromules were also observed in the root epidermis of the double mutant although infrequently . the spherical _LOCATION_ are not an artifact of the precared similar intracellular structure can be observed under light microscopy of the root epidermis of mutant plants that do not harbor the are not present in wild type plants . amyloplasts are starch filled _LOCATION_ that play a central role in gravity perception in both the shoot and the root . amyloplast morphology in the double mutant was indistinguishable from that of wild type plants both by precared marker localization and by potassium iodide staining of starch granules . the observation that _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ encode proteins with n terminal chloroplast transit sequences suggested that they might localize to _LOCATION_ and directly affect their morphology . to test this hypothesis we generated plants _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ fused to _METHOD_ at their c termini under the control of their own promoters as described in citation . the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ transgenes are each capable of rescuing the variegated phenotype of the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ mutant in the and generations . as predicted in both transgenic lines _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was associated with chloroplasts and other _LOCATION_ in the shoot and root . unexpectedly the _METHOD_ signal was not uniform but was localized to distinct spots or foci on the chloroplast surface . either one or two foci were seen usually at one or both ends of the chloroplast . occasionally a third dot was observable at the middle of the _LOCATION_ . the _METHOD_ signal was most frequently found associated with small dividing chloroplasts in the hypocotyl and at the base of expanding leaves but could also be found associated with larger chloroplasts throughout the mesophyll and with nongreen _LOCATION_ of the leaf epidermis and root . by _METHOD_ microscopy _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ _METHOD_ appear to be associated with the _LOCATION_ envelope . to validate this observation we used biochemical fractionation and immunoblotting to characterize the subcellular localization of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . the levels and detectability of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ _METHOD_ were determined by subjecting whole cell extracts of leaf tissue to _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and immunoblotting with an antibody recognizing _METHOD_ . bands at the approximate size predicted for the fusion proteins were detected in the transgenic extracts and no signal was seen in extract from wild type tissue . chloroplasts were isolated from protoplasts derived from each transgenic line purified and fractionated into soluble and _LOCATION_ fractions . equivalent volumes of each fraction were then analyzed by immunoblotting as above . _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ _METHOD_ were detected in purified chloroplasts and in the _LOCATION_ fraction of lysed chloroplasts but were absent from the soluble fraction . as a control for fractionation this blot was stripped and reprobed with antibodies that recognize the large subunit of rubisco _PROTEIN_ a soluble protein of the chloroplast stroma . _PROTEIN_ was found in the soluble fraction only . the intraplastidic localization observed with _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and described above appeared similar to that previously described for the atmine and atmind proteins citation . atmine and atmind are arabidopsis homologs of the bacterial division proteins _PROTEIN_ and mine and are required for the proper localization of the contractile _PROTEIN_ during _LOCATION_ division citation . to test the hypothesis that the foci containing atmind or atmine are the same intraplastidic location that contains _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ we used particle bombardment to transiently _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and atmine _METHOD_ fusion proteins in arabidopsis leaves . _METHOD_ signal was detected in small foci on the surface of _LOCATION_ in epidermal cells transiently _PROTEIN_ either _METHOD_ _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . in general the signal was similar to that observed in stably transformed lines although numerous foci were only observed in bombarded cells and are likely the result of high _PROTEIN_ levels . mine _METHOD_ signal was also detected in foci within the _LOCATION_ as previously described citation and the _METHOD_ signal was observed to overlap with _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ _METHOD_ signals .
