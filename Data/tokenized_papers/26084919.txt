primary plasmodesmata arise at cytokinesis when the new cell plate _METHOD_ . during this process fine strands of _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ are laid down between enlarging _LOCATION_ derived vesicles to form nascent pd each pore containing a desmotubule a membranous rod derived from the cortical _LOCATION_ . little is known about the forces that model the _LOCATION_ during cell plate formation . here we show that members of the reticulon family of _LOCATION_ tubulating proteins in arabidopsis may play a role in the formation of the desmotubule . _PROTEIN_ and two rtnlbs present in the pd proteome are recruited to the cell plate at _PROTEIN_ telophase when primary pd are formed and remain associated with primary pd in the mature cell wall . both rtnlbs showed significant colocalization at pd with the viral movement protein of tobacco mosaic virus while superresolution imaging of primary pd revealed the central desmotubule to be labeled by . _METHOD_ recovery after photobleaching studies showed that these rtnlbs are mobile at the edge of the developing cell plate where new wall materials are being delivered but significantly less mobile at its center where pd are forming . a truncated _PROTEIN_ unable to constrict the _LOCATION_ was not recruited to the cell plate at cytokinesis . we discuss the potential roles of rtnlbs in desmotubule formation .
of the rtnlb homologs in the arabidopsis database we generated transgenic lines for _PROTEIN_ to _PROTEIN_ and either as rtnlb _METHOD_ _METHOD_ or rtnlb _METHOD_ fusions under the control of cauliflower mosaic virus promoters . in all transgenic lines rtnlbs labeled the _LOCATION_ in interphase cells . we noticed for some rtnlb lines that _METHOD_ became localized to the cell plate in dividing root cells . this localization was recorded for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and . in particular strong cell plate labeling was observed for _PROTEIN_ and two rtnlbs present in the pd proteome . to examine rtnlb distribution during cell division we _PROTEIN_ arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ and in tobacco bright yellow cells and followed their distribution in mitotically dividing cells . we used as a marker for the developing cell plate and found that both rtnlbs showed strong colocalization with labeled cell plate _LOCATION_ . we found a strong signal associated with the newly formed wall at the center and a more diffuse signal associated with the trailing edges of the cell plate . next we _PROTEIN_ the lumenal _LOCATION_ marker _METHOD_ hdel together with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . in cv cells at interphase as in arabidopsis _METHOD_ hdel was restricted to pockets in the _LOCATION_ by the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ mediated constriction of the _LOCATION_ lumen . however both _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ hdel labeled the cortical _LOCATION_ uniformly throughout cell division . however _PROTEIN_ became redistributed from the cortical _LOCATION_ into the developing cell plate during mid and _PROTEIN_ telophase features not seen with _METHOD_ hdel . we next agroinfiltrated constructs of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ into nicotiana benthamiana plants transgenically _PROTEIN_ the movement protein of tobacco mosaic virus fused to _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ that is known to locate to pd . in mature epidermal cells we saw a significant colocalization of these rtnlb fusions with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . to confirm that rtnlbs were associated with desmotubules we used three dimensional structured illumination microscopy _PROTEIN_ to examine primary pd in the walls between cv cells . to image the _LOCATION_ associated with pd more clearly we plasmolyzed adjacent cells _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or and also imaged plasmolyzed cells _PROTEIN_ red _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ hdel for comparison . by confocal microscopy we observed a strong rtnlb signal associated with punctae at the end walls of plasmolyzed cells . interestingly hechtian strands connecting the retracting protoplasts with the end walls showed strong rtnlb labeling indicating that a constricted tubule of _LOCATION_ runs through each hechtian strand . in contrast we did not find _METHOD_ hdel within hechtian strands or associated with pd confirming previous reports that _METHOD_ targeted to the _LOCATION_ lumen is excluded from the center of the desmotubule where the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ are in close contact . _METHOD_ hdel was also excluded from the hechtian strands indicating that during plasmolysis _METHOD_ hdel is squeezed into the contracting protoplast . with _PROTEIN_ we were able to resolve simple pd and found that desmotubules labeled with _METHOD_ could be traced across individual cell walls . often we observed the cortical _LOCATION_ undergoing abrupt changes in direction toward the entrance of a pd pore . figure shows the cortical _LOCATION_ associated with a single postdivision wall . note that multiple _LOCATION_ strands extend from the adjoining cells and converge at the entrances of pd where they can be traced across the wall . an enlargement of a region of cortical _LOCATION_ shows that desmotubules are labeled with . a movie depicting the three dimensional arrangement of _LOCATION_ associated with pd is shown in supplemental video . the optical sections shown in supplemental figure were taken nm apart in the axial dimension and show that a single labeled desmotubule can be tracked as it crosses the cell wall . we used frap to study the mobility of rtnlbs in the developing cell plate . we compared the leading edge of the cell plate where the rtnlb signal was diffuse with the middle of the cell plate where rtnlb distribution was tightly confined . we found a higher rate of _METHOD_ recovery at the edge of the cell plate compared with the center indicative of reduced rtnlb mobility during the formation of primary pd . at the completion of cytokinesis we found that a strong rtnlb signal remained on the new cell wall . we then plasmolyzed cv cells _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or and performed frap on the _LOCATION_ associated with the primary pd in the cell wall . there was no _METHOD_ recovery in this location although _LOCATION_ in the center of the cell showed a characteristic _METHOD_ recovery . as cv cells often grow in linear chains we also photobleached the _LOCATION_ of entire cells and monitored the bleached cell for _METHOD_ recovery . in this scenario the only source of _METHOD_ is from neighboring cells across the intervening pd . we failed to detect a return of _METHOD_ into the bleached cell indicating that even though rtnlbs are present in the desmotubule this structure does not form a conduit for rtnlb mobility between cells . next we utilized cv lines stably _PROTEIN_ a truncation of _PROTEIN_ comprising the first two transmembrane domains and _LOCATION_ loop but lacking the c terminal region predicted to form two transmembrane domains _PROTEIN_ . the _LOCATION_ in these cells was less tubular than in cells _PROTEIN_ the full length protein . this truncated protein was not strongly recruited to the cell plate at cytokinesis and remained associated with the cytoplasmic _LOCATION_ . we then performed frap on cells _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ in the cell plate of these cells recovered much more quickly than in those _PROTEIN_ the full length rtnlb _METHOD_ proteins and also at faster rates than lumenal _METHOD_ hdel .
