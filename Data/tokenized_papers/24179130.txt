_PROTEIN_ cytokinesis _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ encodes a putative rab guanine nucleotide exchange _PROTEIN_ that functions in _LOCATION_ trafficking and is required for cytokinesis and cell expansion in arabidopsis thaliana . here we show that the loss of function disrupts cytokinesis and cell expansion and impairs fertility phenotypes similar to those observed for _PROTEIN_ mutants . genetic and biochemical analyses showed that _PROTEIN_ function is dependent upon and that together these proteins are required for _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ internalization . further specifying the role of these proteins in _LOCATION_ trafficking _PROTEIN_ and proteins were found to be associated with isolated clathrin coated vesicles and to colocalize with clathrin light chain at putative sites of endocytosis at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . together these data suggest that _PROTEIN_ and function in clathrin mediated _LOCATION_ transport including _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ endocytosis required for cytokinesis and cell expansion .
heterozygous plants segregated for defects in plant growth and development as expected for a single recessive mutation . analysis of fully expanded mature rosette leaves revealed cytokinesis defects in of stomata representing the various types of defects observed in the stomatal cytokinesis defective mutants _PROTEIN_ and . oblate/type stomata in which no ventral wall or pore was evident predominated at and stomata containing one or more incomplete ventral wall including those that contained a pore occurred at frequency . similar to _PROTEIN_ mutants cw stubs were also observed in leaf epidermal pavement cells stained with toluidine blue o or propidium iodide _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ the cell surface marker green _METHOD_ protein low temperature _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ albeit less frequently than in stomata . the gc specific reporter fusion potassium channel in _PROTEIN_ bacterial _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was used to confirm the gc identity of oblate stomata in leaves distinguishing them from cell cycle arrested gmcs . additionally defective stomata _PROTEIN_ the _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ were observed by confocal laser scanning microscopy _PROTEIN_ to be binucleate an indicator of normal karyokinesis despite subsequent defective cytokinesis . the stomatal density in leaves was elevated relative to that in wild type leaves . additional phenotypes such as incongruous spaces or gaps between epidermal cells and clusters of small cells were observed in the epidermis of leaves and cotyledons when analyzed by _PROTEIN_ . the spaces/gaps were readily visualized by _PROTEIN_ in cotyledons from plants _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ d after germination as small regions between adjacent cells that densely stained with _PROTEIN_ and appeared not to be bound by a distinct pm . clusters of small cells arranged more or less symmetrically were also observed in the cotyledon epidermis of _PROTEIN_ stained and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ plants dag . the spaces/gaps and small cell clusters were previously not reported for _PROTEIN_ mutants however given the similarity in leaf cell division and expansion defects between and _PROTEIN_ mutants we reexamined the cellular arrangements observed in _PROTEIN_ loss of function mutants . similar to _PROTEIN_ imaging of _PROTEIN_ stained _PROTEIN_ cotyledons dag revealed the presence of both _PROTEIN_ positive spaces and small nearly symmetrically organized cell clusters . in addition to cytokinesis defects plants like _PROTEIN_ mutants displayed aberrant growth and development . aerial organs of mutant plants were dwarfed relative to the wild type with bolts that grew to a maximum height of cm and produced flowers that failed to fully mature and were infertile . roots were also stunted due at least in part to reduced cell numbers within the root division and transition zones . the number of cortical cells comprising these zones in three representative confocal images of _PROTEIN_ stained vertically grown seedlings seven dag was cells in the division zone of versus cells for the wild type and in the transition zone cells for compared with cells for the wild type . cell expansion defects were also observed in both _PROTEIN_ and mutants . the average surface area of cotyledon pavement cells from seedlings seven dag was in wild type plants but only for mutants . unlike _PROTEIN_ mutants root hair morphology was unaffected in seedlings . like _PROTEIN_ mutants mutant seedlings were hypersensitive to suc resulting in a markedly smaller and darker appearance than wild type seedlings grown on the same media . taken together these defective phenotypes of mutants indicate a role for in cytokinesis and cell expansion . standard map based cloning coupled with dna sequencing revealed the lesion to be a deletion of a guanine nucleotide at position of the _GENE_ open reading frame . the identity of was supported through the ability of a genomic clone including the entire kb region of _GENE_ plus kb of upstream sequence and kb of downstream sequence to rescue mutant phenotypes . transgenic lines displayed normal growth and development including leaf and root expansion and gc formation at all stages of development . in addition a second mutant allele which is the result of a t dna insertion within the third intron of was identified that cosegregates with mutant phenotypes . according to data compiled by the bio array resource for plant functional genomics is _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis roots hypocotyls cotyledons rosette leaves whole flowers carpels stamens pollen and seed . is also highly _PROTEIN_ in gcs . to further assess the cell and tissue specific _PROTEIN_ patterns of we generated transgenic wild type lines transformed with a bacterial gus encoding reporter orf under control of the kb promoter region . _PROTEIN_ of gus was observed in gcs in the epidermis of cotyledons and rosette leaves in seedlings and adult plants and often in the socket cells surrounding the base of trichomes . strong gus staining was also observed in hydathodes of fully expanded rosette leaves . in roots gus staining was observed at the mature region of the primary root and the tips of short young _PROTEIN_ roots branching from the primary root but not the primary root tip . was predicted by the pfam database to encode a bp mrna and a amino acid protein with a molecular _METHOD_ of kd containing a pair of central coiled coil domains that mapped to and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ according to the algorithm . the single base pair deletion in resulted in a frame shift in the predicted orf that would encode a truncated protein due to a premature stop codon preceded by out of frame amino acids following of . is similar at the amino acid level to four other arabidopsis putative proteins encoded by _GENE_ and _GENE_ . these homologs were also predicted to encode coiled coil domains as well as a prodom defined plant specific domain of unknown function _PROTEIN_ at their _PROTEIN_ termini that they share with which we refer to as the domain . the percentage identity and similarity of the predicted full length proteins and domains of these four homologs compared pairwise to are reported in supplemental table online . a blast search of the national center for biotechnology information database revealed the presence of putative homologs in other divergent plant genomes such as those of the genera ricinus vitis cucumis solanum zea glycine oryza sorghum panicum picea and populus but not in the genomes of animals fungi or protists suggesting that the protein serves a plant specific function . of the four arabidopsis homologs _PROTEIN_ sequence tags have been identified for _GENE_ and and all four have been detected in cdna libraries used in microarray analyses . mutants share many of the pleiotropic phenotypes of _PROTEIN_ mutants such as incomplete cytokinesis in leaf epidermal cells cell expansion defects and suc hypersensitivity . double mutant analysis was conducted to investigate whether _PROTEIN_ and mutants affect the same or related cellular _METHOD_ or pathways . the root expansion defects of _PROTEIN_ and mutant seedlings grown vertically on suc media were visibly polymorphic and easily scored thus root growth was monitored in a segregating _PROTEIN_ double mutant population . the root lengths of homozygous _PROTEIN_ double mutant and _PROTEIN_ and single mutant seedlings dag were and mm respectively while the root length of wild type seedlings which outgrew the plate at dag was last recorded at mm . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ root length measurements were determined not to be significantly different and the growth rate of _PROTEIN_ double mutant seedlings was nearly identical to that of _PROTEIN_ mutants while and wild type seedlings grew faster indicating that _PROTEIN_ double mutants mimic the root growth phenotype of the _PROTEIN_ single mutants but not that of the single mutants . the _PROTEIN_ double mutant root growth phenotype also was not intermediate between or different from that of the and _PROTEIN_ single mutants . together these data indicate that _PROTEIN_ is epistatic to . affinity purified antibodies generated against the amino terminus of reproducibly detected two polypeptides in whole seedling extracts that migrated at or near the predicted kd molecular _METHOD_ of the protein . both polypeptides were absent in and protein extracts while was detected in extracts from _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants at levels similar to those of the wild type and _PROTEIN_ and mutants _PROTEIN_ functional _PROTEIN_ and under the control of their native promoters _PROTEIN_ respectively . to confirm equal loading of total protein the samples were probed with antibodies against soluble and _LOCATION_ protein markers _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ bisphosphatase and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ like protein _PROTEIN_ respectively . as shown in figure the levels of cfbp were similar in all protein extracts analyzed . however the levels of _PROTEIN_ a protein required for cp _LOCATION_ fusion and _PROTEIN_ an integral _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ protein varied significantly between wild type rescued lines and scd mutant total protein extracts . these variations may reflect changes in _LOCATION_ composition and/or protein abundance in the mutant plants . indeed a survey of arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ data available through genevestigator for conditions that result in similar trends in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ levels indicated that the levels of these _LOCATION_ associated proteins are altered in plants _PROTEIN_ with a variety of biotic and abiotic stressors and thus may be an indirect effect of the compromised development of these mutants . as previously demonstrated affinity purified _PROTEIN_ antibodies _PROTEIN_ detected the kd _PROTEIN_ protein in total protein extracts from the wild type _PROTEIN_ and to a lesser extent _PROTEIN_ plants but not in _PROTEIN_ plant extracts . interestingly _PROTEIN_ levels were markedly reduced in total protein extracts from and plants compared with those of the wild type . by contrast the levels of the _PROTEIN_ and proteins were similar in plant extracts from the wild type and the stomatal cytokinesis defective mutant indicating that the observed reduction of _PROTEIN_ in mutants is not due to a general defect in gc cytokinesis and cell expansion . the mammalian connecdenn protein has been identified as a component of ccvs . to investigate if _PROTEIN_ and/or are associated with plant ccvs we employed a tandem fractionation scheme to prepare an enriched sample of ccvs from rapidly dividing and expanding suspension cultured arabidopsis cells . by negative stain electron microscopy analysis the final ccv enriched fraction was found to contain clathrin coated versus noncoated vesicles . immunoblot analysis of the cell lysate and subsequent successive fractions generated in the preparation of ccvs demonstrated that the final ccv fraction was significantly enriched for clathrin and _PROTEIN_ including _PROTEIN_ heavy chains _PROTEIN_ light _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ protein complex _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ components and the _PROTEIN_ epidermal _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ receptor _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ interacting protein . the presence of both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ demonstrated that the final enriched ccv fraction includes tgn derived and endocytic ccvs . the final enriched ccv fractions were also enriched in the cp and endosomal trans soluble n ethylmaleimide sensitive _PROTEIN_ attachment receptors _PROTEIN_ and syntaxin of _PROTEIN_ respectively highlighting the enrichment of _PROTEIN_ secretory pathway _LOCATION_ targeting and fusion proteins in clathrin enriched fractions . by contrast marker proteins for the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ cis _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ chloroplast _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ and mitochondria _PROTEIN_ were significantly depleted in the final ccv preparations . importantly immunoblot analysis using affinity purified anti _PROTEIN_ and term antibodies demonstrated that these two proteins cofractionated with ccvs . consistent with our immunoblot analysis of protein in seedling total protein extracts we detected two major and kd polypeptides in the arabidopsis suspension cultured cell homogenate as well as an additional polypeptide with higher apparent molecular _METHOD_ of kd that was below detection in whole seedling extracts . notably the and kd polypeptides detected with the affinity purified anti term antibody were enriched whereas the kd polypeptide was depleted in ccv enriched fractions . unlike _PROTEIN_ an integral _LOCATION_ protein _PROTEIN_ and the and kd polypeptides were released from microsomal _LOCATION_ after treatment with m urea . low but detectable levels of soluble _PROTEIN_ and the and kd polypeptides were also present in _LOCATION_ free _LOCATION_ indicating that _PROTEIN_ and are peripheral _LOCATION_ proteins . to corroborate the presence of _PROTEIN_ and on ccvs we further characterized the ccv enriched fraction via immunoelectron microscopy . the embedded ccv suspension was thin sectioned to achieve a broad distribution of exposed epitopes _LOCATION_ . probing sections with the anti _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ antibodies clearly demonstrated the presence of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ on a subpopulation of vesicles . however attempts to use the affinity purified anti term antibody to localize the protein were unsuccessful suggesting that the antibody is not suitable for immunoelectron microscopy analysis under the conditions used . large field views of sections probed with anti _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ term and the anti rabbit nm gold conjugate secondary antibodies revealed a strong specificity and an apparently higher proportion of vesicles labeled with anti _PROTEIN_ versus those with anti _PROTEIN_ . however it is possible that this result reflects differences in epitope availability rather than reduced levels of _PROTEIN_ on a given vesicle relative to another . based upon the cytokinesis and cell expansion defects of _PROTEIN_ and mutants and their cofractionation with _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ ccvs we hypothesized that _PROTEIN_ and proteins are required for post _LOCATION_ and/or endocytic trafficking . to determine whether pm endocytosis is impaired in the scd mutants we used _PROTEIN_ to monitor the cellular internalization of the lipophilic dye in the roots of wild type and scd seedlings . representative images showed a _PROTEIN_ in the number of labeled _METHOD_ puncta within root cells of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and mutants after min compared with wild type cells . quantification of internalization _PROTEIN_ as the average ratio of intracellular _METHOD_ signal per unit area versus that of pm normalized to the wild type revealed endocytosis was significantly reduced in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ compared with the wild type respectively . given that _PROTEIN_ and cofractionate with ccvs and that _PROTEIN_ and mutants display impaired internalization we examined whether n terminally _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ and/or colocalize with ccps at the cell cortex by variable angle _METHOD_ microscopy . _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ under the control of their native promoters in homozygous _PROTEIN_ and respectively rescued the phenotypic growth and developmental defects of _PROTEIN_ and mutants demonstrating that the _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ and fusion constructs are functional . similar to clc morange which localizes to ccps vaem imaging of epidermal root cells of seedlings _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ or _METHOD_ revealed that these two proteins likewise localize at or near the pm in discrete dynamic foci . intriguingly in _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ lines coexpressing _PROTEIN_ morange we observed a subpopulation of foci at or near the pm that contained both _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ morange or _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ morange . colocalization of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ morange or _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ morange was quantitatively verified using the costes randomization test . image pairs were analyzed with costes iterations using a point spread function . the pearson coefficients of both pairs were higher than that of all iterations of each respective analysis resulting in a costes p value of for both pairs . a p value greater than is taken to demarcate colocalization demonstrating that a subpopulation of _PROTEIN_ and foci at or near the pm contain _PROTEIN_ .
