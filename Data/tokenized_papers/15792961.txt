the genome of arabidopsis thaliana contains myosin xi _METHOD_ . here we prepared a specific antibody against a peptide that mimics a unique c terminal region from the myosin xi isoform _PROTEIN_ . the resulting antibody was used to demonstrate that _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis protein extracts co sedimented with actin filaments and dissociated from the filaments with _PROTEIN_ treatment . immunolocalization studies showed that _PROTEIN_ co localized predominantly with actin filaments in clustered punctuate dots in leaf epidermal cells root hair cells and suspension cultured cells . in a transgenic plant in which _LOCATION_ are labeled with green _METHOD_ protein some _PROTEIN_ signals were localized on _LOCATION_ in an actin dependent manner . we propose that the _LOCATION_ is one of the cargos translocated by _PROTEIN_ on actin filaments .
to make a specific antibody against _PROTEIN_ we compared the amino acid sequences in the diverse tail region of myosin xi _METHOD_ and identified regions with relatively low similarity to corresponding sequences of other _METHOD_ . the antiserum raised against this peptide cross reacted with several polypeptides in a crude protein sample prepared from wild type arabidopsis seedlings whereas an antibody affinity purified from the serum recognized only a kda protein as expected for _PROTEIN_ . when the affinity purified antibody was incubated with the antigen peptide before immunoblotting the signal intensity of the kda protein was _PROTEIN_ as the peptide concentration was raised above ml . in contrast the kda signal was not affected by prior incubation with the corresponding peptides from _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ even at a concentration of ml . we identified an arabidopsis line in which a t dna was inserted in the intron of _PROTEIN_ . to examine _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ reverse trnascription polymerase chain reaction was performed at three regions of the _PROTEIN_ gene . in plants homozygous for the t dna insertion the _PROTEIN_ transcript appeared to be truncated after the t dna insertion site . accordingly the _PROTEIN_ antibody raised against the c terminal tail region did not detect the kda protein in extracts from homozygous mutant plants . taken together these results demonstrated that the purified antibody specifically recognized the _PROTEIN_ isoform . when the crude protein extract from wild type arabidopsis seedlings was supplemented with polymerized f actin centrifuged and examined by immunoblotting with the _PROTEIN_ antibody _PROTEIN_ protein was co sedimented with actin filaments and recovered in the pellet fraction . futhermore when the pellet was incubated with a solution containing _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was recovered in the supernatant fraction after centrifugation suggesting that the putative _PROTEIN_ f actin complex was dissociated . these results indicated that _PROTEIN_ binds to f actin in the absence of _PROTEIN_ and detaches from f actin in the presence of _PROTEIN_ . we examined the intracellular localization of _PROTEIN_ in epidermal cells of leaf and stem . in guard cells strong _PROTEIN_ signals were observed . these dots were predominantly co localized with actin filaments . in root hair cells and suspension cultured cells punctuate signals appeared to form clusters in regions where actin filaments were present at higher density . when the epidermal cells were treated with latrunculin b an actin depolymerizing drug no filamentous actin signals were observed and small _PROTEIN_ dots were dispersed throughout the cytoplasm . when the _PROTEIN_ antibody was mixed with the _PROTEIN_ antigen peptide at ml before immunostaining no strong signals were detected in the leaf epidermal cells . furthermore the _PROTEIN_ antibody did not detect significant signals in the leaf epidermal cells from the homozygous t dna disruption allele . thus the punctuate signals observed in this study represent genuine _PROTEIN_ protein localization . it has been reported that the movement of _LOCATION_ is driven by an actin myosin system in plant cells . to test whether _PROTEIN_ is a motor protein responsible for the _LOCATION_ movement _PROTEIN_ localization was examined in leaf epidermal cells and guard cells of transgenic arabidopsis plants in which green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ was fused to the peroxisomal targeting signal peptide and stably _PROTEIN_ . due to the methanol treatment of plant samples during the freeze substitution procedure the intrinsic _METHOD_ of _METHOD_ was not detectable under an _METHOD_ microscope . therefore an antibody against _METHOD_ was used to detect the _METHOD_ protein . in a crude protein extract prepared from the transgenic seedlings the _METHOD_ antibody recognized only one protein of approximately kda as expected for the peroxisomal targeted _METHOD_ . furthermore immunostaining of epidermal and guard cells from leaves with the anti _METHOD_ antibody appeared to be similar to images of _METHOD_ signals in those cells of living transgenic plants with respect to the size and the density . double immunostaining using anti _PROTEIN_ antibody and anti _METHOD_ antibody showed that some _PROTEIN_ dot signals of a relatively large size were co localized with _METHOD_ labeled _LOCATION_ . however fine punctuate _PROTEIN_ signals especially in guard cells did not overlap with _LOCATION_ . in the _PROTEIN_ t dna insertion allele the mutant _PROTEIN_ protein if present should lack the c terminal motor neck and tail domains and thus is considered to be non functional . morphology growth and fertility were indistinguishable between wild type and the _PROTEIN_ null allele plants . next we compared the distribution of _LOCATION_ in epidermal cells of wild type leaves with that of the _PROTEIN_ null allele by immunostaining using an antibody against a peroxisomal marker protein catalase . the distribution patterns of _LOCATION_ were indistinguishable between wild type and mutant epidermal cells . these results indicate that disruption of _PROTEIN_ does not cause gross cellular and morphological abnormalities .
