background and _METHOD_ neutral red _PROTEIN_ a lipophilic phenazine dye has been widely used in various biological _METHOD_ as a vital stain for bright field microscopy . in its unprotonated form it penetrates the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and tonoplast of viable plant cells then due to protonation it becomes trapped in acidic compartments . the possible applications of _PROTEIN_ for confocal laser scanning microscopy _PROTEIN_ studies were examined in various aspects of plant root biology . methods _PROTEIN_ was used as a fluorochrome for living roots of phaseolus vulgaris allium cepa a. porrum and arabidopsis thaliana _METHOD_ . the tissues were visualized using _PROTEIN_ . the effect of _PROTEIN_ on the integrity of the _LOCATION_ and the growth rate of arabidopsis primary roots was analysed to judge potential toxic effects of the dye . key results the _PROTEIN_ advantages of the use of _PROTEIN_ are related to the _PROTEIN_ that _PROTEIN_ rapidly penetrates root tissues has affinity to suberin and lignin and accumulates in the _LOCATION_ . it is shown that _PROTEIN_ is a suitable probe for visualization of proto and metaxylem elements _PROTEIN_ bands in the endodermis and _LOCATION_ in cells of living roots . the actin _LOCATION_ and the microtubule system of the cells as well as the dynamics of root growth remain unchanged after short term application of _PROTEIN_ indicating a relatively low toxicity of this chemical . it was also found that _PROTEIN_ is a useful probe for the observation of the internal structures of root nodules and of fungal hyphae in vesicular arbuscular mycorrhizas . conclusions ease low cost and absence of tissue processing make _PROTEIN_ a useful probe for structural developmental and _LOCATION_ biogenetic studies of plant roots with _PROTEIN_ .
to allow unequivocal distinction of signals from _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ emission spectra of _PROTEIN_ stained structures were collected . these data confirmed the wide emission spectra observed earlier and showed that the highest emission peak was nm for _LOCATION_ and nm for protoxylem metaxylem and _PROTEIN_ bands . it was surprising to find that the emission spectra recorded in stained arabidopsis tissues showed up to five peaks or shoulders . to study the potential toxicity of _PROTEIN_ at the concentrations used for _PROTEIN_ studies arabidopsis root growth dynamics were analysed . roots grown in _METHOD_ medium supplemented with _PROTEIN_ stopped growing and did not recover for at least of incubation in the medium . however after d of growth in the medium supplemented with _PROTEIN_ roots were only shorter than the roots grown in normal medium . interestingly short term treatment of min in _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ did not inhibit subsequent root growth . these data indicate that the toxicity of _PROTEIN_ is relatively low at which is the concentration sufficient to visualize _PROTEIN_ band xylem elements or _LOCATION_ under _PROTEIN_ . both the microtubule network and the actin _LOCATION_ are very sensitive to disturbance and pharmacological treatments . to test whether _PROTEIN_ affects the microtubule network or the actin _LOCATION_ in living roots a comparative study was made of the roots of various transgenic lines where microtubules and the actin _LOCATION_ were observed . under the influence of _PROTEIN_ no significant differences were detected in the distribution of cortical microtubules in the elongated cells of the _METHOD_ line _METHOD_ . when the roots of this line were incubated for h with oryzalin changes in the orientation of cortical microtubules were observed . the h treatment induced complete disorganization of microtubules . incubation of the roots with _PROTEIN_ did not have any of these effects . also possible changes in the actin _LOCATION_ induced by _PROTEIN_ were tested . there were no significant changes in the actin _LOCATION_ either in cortical cells of the transition zone of arabidopsis roots or in the young differentiation zone . in _METHOD_ mtn and _METHOD_ lines cells in the transition zone both with and without _PROTEIN_ treatments had a similar distribution of f actin arrays suggesting that _PROTEIN_ does not affect the actin _LOCATION_ . similarly there were no significant differences in the actin _LOCATION_ detected in recently elongated cortical cells in the roots of a _METHOD_ line . these observations indicate that and of _PROTEIN_ is not cytotoxic for roots of arabidopsis when applied for up to min . upon vital staining of roots of arabidopsis thaliana col and ler _PROTEIN_ penetrated well into all root zones except the root apical meristem _PROTEIN_ . incubation in _PROTEIN_ prepared in _METHOD_ supplemented with mm potassium phosphate buffer for min was sufficient for visualization of protoxylem although the signal was still weak . after h of incubation _METHOD_ from the protoxylem was stronger . the images were acquired at the same laser settings . in this particular case grey value levels increased times after extensive staining . in the case of propidium iodide even prolonged incubation at a high concentration did not result in penetration into the stele of living arabidopsis roots _PROTEIN_ . in comparison to experiments at ph staining of the cell walls was in general very weak at ph . however protoxylem and metaxylem elements were well stained and _PROTEIN_ bands could be detected . they even appeared to be stained more specifically as the _PROTEIN_ of these stained structures at this ph was visually different from samples at ph . for example the lignified cell wall component of the protoxylem elements appeared thinner when stained at alkaline ph in comparison to acidic ph _PROTEIN_ . a similar effect could be observed upon addition of salt to the staining solution at ph _PROTEIN_ . in addition in the presence of salt _PROTEIN_ or concentrated buffer _LOCATION_ of the transition zone or transition and differentiation zone were stained at ph respectively . high buffer concentrations induced plasmolysis in the root tissues and allowed visualization of _LOCATION_ in all root zones . this was the only staining condition that permitted detection of the _LOCATION_ system in the differentiation zone . upon prolonged incubation the root meristem could be stained consistently in a staining solution containing m phosphate buffer at ph . the other staining media were not effective in this case . in the early differentiation zone where the protoxylem is not yet differentiated _PROTEIN_ at ph can be used as a general stain that serves well for recognition of various root tissues . in the more mature portion of the root _PROTEIN_ was found to be useful for detection of the _PROTEIN_ bands of the endodermis cells and proto and metaxylem elements . even the lowest concentration of _PROTEIN_ tested was sufficient for visualization of these internal tissues . at high concentrations of _PROTEIN_ staining of cell walls was too intense to detect _PROTEIN_ bands . under the same _PROTEIN_ settings and the same staining time _PROTEIN_ there was no difference in the _METHOD_ intensity of cell walls in young and mature differentiation zones of the same root _METHOD_ . however some transgenic lines did show differences in the _METHOD_ intensity in comparison to wild type plants . it was found that _PROTEIN_ was sufficient to obtain transverse images of arabidopsis roots that permitted visualization of all tissues and the _PROTEIN_ bands of the endodermis . using _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ bands could also be detected in a mutant with abnormal development of the ground tissue . the _LOCATION_ system of root cortical cells in arabidopsis a. cepa and p. vulgaris was studied for its _PROTEIN_ accumulation properties . at the basal portion of the root apical meristem the _LOCATION_ system of the cells is already formed in both arabidopsis and p. vulgaris roots . at this stage of cellular development cells have a system of many small _LOCATION_ . some of them are < _PROTEIN_ . at the beginning of cell elongation in the transition zone the _LOCATION_ become progressively larger proportional to the increase in cell length . in this process the _LOCATION_ fuse and finally form a large central _LOCATION_ . in effect the same observations were made for arabidopsis and a. cepa roots . good penetration ability of _PROTEIN_ at ph was also verified in such organs as the root nodule in p. vulgaris . using _PROTEIN_ the general morphology of the nodule could be observed . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ stained the _LOCATION_ system of differentiated nodule cells . central _LOCATION_ were formed in the peripheral tissues of the nodules . in this case _PROTEIN_ could not penetrate into internal tissues possibly due to binding to peripheral structures . analysing an enhancer trap line of a. thaliana where _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ is _PROTEIN_ in the root cap and presumptive xylem elements _PROTEIN_ was visualized in the _LOCATION_ system of the columella and _PROTEIN_ root cap cells . in the protruding _PROTEIN_ root primordium the _LOCATION_ system of root cap cells was not detected . at a more advanced stage _PROTEIN_ staining was similar in the primary and _PROTEIN_ roots at ph and at ph . since _PROTEIN_ rapidly penetrates into the tissues of the central cylinder of the root it is a very useful probe for in vivo analysis of _PROTEIN_ root development . this is illustrated here using a _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ line . _PROTEIN_ staining of xylem elements permits easy recognition of the plane of orientation while the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ highlights the _PROTEIN_ root primordia . in the roots stained with _PROTEIN_ primordia at stages ii and iv located in the protoxylem plane can be seen . previously the question about the minimum number of founder cells required for _PROTEIN_ root initiation in arabidopsis was studied and it was shown that three pericycle cells are sufficient to form a primordium . analysing enhancer trap line where pericycle cells adjacent to protoxylem _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ it was found that pericycle cells from three cell files adjacent to the protoxylem _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . when the root is placed in a protophloem plane these cells can be observed above the protoxylem detected with _PROTEIN_ in a longitudinal tangential or transverse optical section made with a _PROTEIN_ . during _PROTEIN_ root development a founder cell should theoretically be undergoing changes in the _LOCATION_ as the cell _PROTEIN_ has to be changed during the formation of a new organ . the study of the _LOCATION_ in deeper layers of living roots is not an easy task . the present attempt to visualize the _LOCATION_ in the pericycle was possible when _PROTEIN_ was applied to living roots of _METHOD_ mtn and _METHOD_ lines . the use of _PROTEIN_ permitted the protoxylem to be recognized and thus the identification of the pericycle cells which are competent for _PROTEIN_ root formation in living roots of a transgenic line where _METHOD_ is fused either to mouse talin or to the actin binding domain of plant fimbrin . in the transition zone central _LOCATION_ are surrounded with an f actin cage which interacts with actin rich end poles . the use of _PROTEIN_ will enable further studies of the underlying dynamics in the _LOCATION_ . fungal structures are barely visible in mycorrhizal roots without staining . in earlier studies _PROTEIN_ was introduced as a suitable vital stain for detection of arbuscules within colonized roots . here it is demonstrated that _PROTEIN_ used as a _METHOD_ probe for _PROTEIN_ is suitable for improving the detection of fungal structures within roots . while the colonized plant cells show hardly any staining the most intense _METHOD_ signal lies within fungal structures . _PROTEIN_ permitted d reconstruction of fungal structures within roots .
the arabidopsis thaliana lines used were wild type col and ler scr mutant enhancer trap lines and other transgenic lines _METHOD_ mammalian microtubule associated protein _METHOD_ mouse talin actin binding domain fused to the c terminus of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ mtn _METHOD_ actin binding domain _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . these lines were selected to test general staining properties of _PROTEIN_ and its effect on actin _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and microtubule network _METHOD_ . other _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ lines _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were used to test the possibility for cross talk between green emission of _METHOD_ and red emission of _PROTEIN_ as well as to examine how appropriate _PROTEIN_ is for developmental studies . the seeds were surface sterilized for min in commercial bleach and triton x rinsed four times with sterile distilled water and _PROTEIN_ at for h. seeds were plated on murashige and skoog medium _METHOD_ ph supplemented with sucrose and solidified with bacto agar . petri dishes were _PROTEIN_ in a vertical position at under an h h light cycle . to prevent any root damage seedlings were selected with the root system growing on the agar surface . phaseolusvulgaris negro jamapa seeds were surface sterilized with ethanol for min and subsequently with bleach for min and washed six times with sterile water . seeds were germinated aseptically in petri dishes containing wet filter paper to ensure germination . germinated seeds were transferred to liquid fahraeus medium . the roots were inoculated withrhizobium etli . allium cepa seeds were germinated on filter paper moistened with distilled water . growth and culture conditions of mycorrhizal plants were described earlier . arabidopsis plants were grown for d on _METHOD_ medium ph and for the toxicity test transferred to the same agar medium containing filter sterilized _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . alternatively roots of intact plants d after germination were incubated for min in liquid _METHOD_ medium containing _PROTEIN_ and then transferred to _PROTEIN_ free _METHOD_ medium . root growth increments were recorded each h. experiments were repeated at least twice . growth conditions were the same as indicated above . the actin _LOCATION_ and the cortical microtubule network are very sensitive to toxic compounds . therefore the effect of _PROTEIN_ on the _LOCATION_ was investigated . oryzalin an inhibitor of microtubule polymerization served as a positive control for disruption of the microtubule network in living arabidopsis roots . all observations were done on living roots of intact arabidopsis seedlings dag unless indicated otherwise on whole roots of a. cepa dag and on excised portions of living roots of p. vulgaris dag . day of germination was considered the day when seeds were plated on _METHOD_ medium . _PROTEIN_ was used for the preparation of mm stock solution in water and kept at for weeks . after that period a new stock was used . the final concentration of _PROTEIN_ ranged from to and mostly was or . only freshly prepared solutions were used . the ph of the staining solution was _METHOD_ or . at ph the staining solution solvent consisted of m potassium phosphate buffer m potassium phosphate buffer both prepared in water _METHOD_ medium supplemented with mm potassium phosphate buffer or medium supplemented with mm _PROTEIN_ . since for arabidopsis roots background staining was acceptable at ph the staining solution was mostly prepared in _METHOD_ medium . for staining of arabidopsis roots min of incubation was sufficient . in some cases material was kept in _PROTEIN_ solution for up to h. when roots were stained with a very low concentration of _PROTEIN_ the time required for staining was min . phaseolus vulgaris cm root portions were incubated with _PROTEIN_ for min . in each particular case the staining time is indicated in the figure legends . for comparison some material was stained with ml iodide for min . mycorrhizal roots were stained _PROTEIN_ and examined according to guttenberger . plant material was mounted directly in the solution of _PROTEIN_ or propidium iodide on a slide which was wrapped three times with two mm _PROTEIN_ strips of parafilm mm apart from one another and covered by a mm coverslip . when observations were done on an inverted microscope after mounting the coverslip was fixed in its position by another two thin strips of parafilm . at ph _PROTEIN_ has a wide excitation spectrum ranging from to nm and a wide emission spectrum with the maximum ranging from to nm . the reported emission spectra of _PROTEIN_ include significant emission between and nm . in the current work _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ transgenic lines were used . it is known that _METHOD_ emission peaks at nm indicating that _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ emissions overlap . this is why before observing tissues _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ it was necessary to verify which tissues in non transgenic material emit green _METHOD_ when _PROTEIN_ is used . in wild type col seedlings neither _PROTEIN_ bands and xylem nor _LOCATION_ emitted significant green _METHOD_ . to avoid the possibility of cross talk the laser power was _PROTEIN_ at the level that kept green _METHOD_ from _PROTEIN_ minimal or absent . in most cases this approach permitted _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ emissions to be detected separately . the emission spectra of plant material stained with _PROTEIN_ have not been reported . the zeiss lsm meta microscope made it possible to acquire a series of images of the same object area each taken with different emission wavelengths in nm steps . this stack is called a lambda stack . a lambda stack of various tissues and sub cellular compartments reacting with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was acquired and _METHOD_ intensities plotted against wavelengths to obtain emission curves . considering these spectra _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ were detected with the emission filters _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ respectively . confocal images were acquired on an upright leica and an inverted zeiss lsm meta microscopes . leica oil immersion leica water immersion and zeiss dry and water immersion objectives were used . with a leica miscroscope and nm lines of a kr/ar laser were used . with the zeiss microscope nm line of a he/ne laser and nm of an ar laser were used for _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ excitation . to further _PROTEIN_ cross talk and improve spectral separation during image acquisition of samples containing _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ commonly the sequential scan was used and different excitation wavelengths were employed _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . for transgenic lines mutants and wild type plants no _METHOD_ was detected . each single section represents an average of four scans . some reported figures represent maximum intensity projections of a stack of confocal optical sections . to obtain a transverse section a longitudinal optical section was acquired the zone of interest was detected and a tracing line perpendicular to the root axis was set over the image . then with the zeiss lsm meta microscope acquisition software images along the tracing line of increasing depth of focus were taken and subsequently visualized at a angle . at progressively deeper depth of focus the _METHOD_ signal _PROTEIN_ progressively . this explains why transverse sections of the images were always brighter at the top and dim at the bottom . for image analysis the zeiss image examiner software version and image j were used .
