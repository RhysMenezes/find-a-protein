arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are integral _LOCATION_ proteins genetically identified to be necessary for efficient intracellular multiplication of tobamoviruses . _PROTEIN_ interacts with the helicase domain polypeptide of replication proteins and with suggesting that both _PROTEIN_ and are integral components of the tobamovirus replication complex . we show here that _PROTEIN_ and proteins tagged with green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ are targeted to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ structures in plant cells . in subcellular fractionation analyses _METHOD_ and its tobacco homolog were predominantly fractionated to fractions whereas _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and its tobacco homolog were distributed _PROTEIN_ into the fractions and partially into fractions containing _LOCATION_ from several other organelles . the replication proteins were with both and viral rna polymerase activity . the replication proteins were also found in the fractions containing proteins but neither nor the polymerase activity was detected there . these observations suggest that the formation of tobamoviral rna replication complex occurs on _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ and is facilitated by _PROTEIN_ .
to study the intracellular localization of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in living cells we used green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ as a reporter . _METHOD_ was fused in frame to either the or of _PROTEIN_ and . the resulting constructs _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ were _PROTEIN_ transiently in epidermal cells of a.thaliana leaves by microprojectile bombardment . the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ in the cells was analyzed under a confocal laser scanning microscope . fig ref shows a representative image of an epidermal cell transiently _PROTEIN_ free _METHOD_ . in addition to its preferential accumulation inside the _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was observed in the area lining the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . the _LOCATION_ of mature leaf epidermal cells generally occupy most of the intracellular space and press the cytoplasm against the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . therefore the observed _METHOD_ lining the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ is likely to represent cytoplasmic localization . of the two _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ constructs only _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ successfully showed the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . the _METHOD_ was found in the area lining the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ but not in the _LOCATION_ . however it is difficult to specify whether the observed _METHOD_ is derived from the cytoplasm tonoplast _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ or other organelles . essentially the same _METHOD_ pattern was observed in cells transiently _PROTEIN_ either _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ . is predicted to possess a putative farnesylation signal . this signal functions only at the of a protein so that _METHOD_ but not _METHOD_ should preserve the functional signal . considering the possible importance of farnesylation _METHOD_ was used for further analyses . the distribution patterns of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ in epidermal cells of nicotiana benthamiana and n.tabacum were the same as in a.thaliana cells when transiently _PROTEIN_ . nicotiana tabacum cells are known to have relatively undeveloped _LOCATION_ compared with mature leaf epidermal cells . owing to the difficulty in determining the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ and in epidermal cells we used cells for further investigation . when cells stably _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ were analyzed by confocal laser scanning microscopy strikingly clear images were obtained compared with those of leaf epidermal cells . in cells _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was targeted to the intracellular _LOCATION_ of structures . these structures were indistinguishable from the _METHOD_ _LOCATION_ structures observed in cells transiently _PROTEIN_ the _METHOD_ attom proteins obtained by microprojectile bombardment . to identify the observed _LOCATION_ structures we analyzed transgenic cells stably _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in vivo markers for several major organelles including a tonoplast protein _METHOD_ a _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ protein _METHOD_ a _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ protein _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and an _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ marker protein _METHOD_ . it was found that the _LOCATION_ structures shown in the cells _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ have a strong resemblance to those observed for _METHOD_ . such structures did not appear in cells _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ or _METHOD_ . furthermore cells _PROTEIN_ the _METHOD_ attom proteins did not show the _LOCATION_ reticulate structures the _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ spots or a _METHOD_ line observed between two neighboring _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ cells . the vital _LOCATION_ stain which is known as the endocytic tracer visualizes the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ in yeast and plant cells . in order to verify that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ reside on the tonoplast the transgenic cells were with . as shown in fig ref and fig ref first labeled the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ which did not overlap the _LOCATION_ structures visualized by the _METHOD_ tom proteins or the tonoplast marker _METHOD_ . approximately h after labeling the _METHOD_ of transported to the tonoplasts by endocytosis overlapped perfectly with the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ in cells _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ . the complete overlap of the signals of and _METHOD_ confirmed the tonoplast localization of . these observations clearly demonstrated that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ are both localized _PROTEIN_ to the tonoplasts . this also implies that the _METHOD_ structures observed in leaf epidermal cells _PROTEIN_ the _METHOD_ tom proteins represent the tonoplasts rather than the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ or appressed cytoplasm . for further investigation of the localization of the tom proteins we employed _LOCATION_ flotation analysis using equilibrium iodixanol centrifugation . through iodixanol gradients _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ proteins of different intracellular compartments are finely separated according to their buoyant density as previously reported . first we analyzed the distribution of the _METHOD_ attom proteins and tobacco tom homologs and in the gradients to confirm that the localization of the _METHOD_ fusions shown by confocal microscopy reflects that of the authentic tom proteins . the transgenic cells _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ and the cells were disrupted and centrifuged at a low speed to pellet and remove cell debris . the lysates were loaded into the bottom of the gradients and centrifuged at g for h. the gradients were then fractionated and analyzed by immunoblotting . an antibody against _METHOD_ was used to detect _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ . and were detected using antisera against _PROTEIN_ and respectively and the fractionation patterns were compared . fig ref and fig ref illustrates representative fractionation patterns of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and respectively . the _METHOD_ antibody detected bands migrating around a position corresponding to a molecular _METHOD_ of kda which was smaller than the expected value . these bands were also detected by antiserum . both _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and were detected as double bands suggesting that _PROTEIN_ may undergo modifications . the fractionation pattern of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was similar to that of . both proteins predominantly floated to the top fraction of the gradient while they were also detected in fractions with relatively strong signals in the middle part of the gradient . the bands were almost undetectable in the bottom part where the cell lysates were originally loaded . fraction l contains most of the cytoplasmic proteins indicating that _PROTEIN_ is exclusively a _LOCATION_ protein . the fractionation patterns of _METHOD_ and are shown in fig ref and fig ref respectively . both proteins showed strong signals in fraction t. they were weakly detected in all other _LOCATION_ fractions when overexposed but were absent in fraction l again indicating that they were completely _LOCATION_ . in _METHOD_ the size of the fusion protein detected by the _METHOD_ antibody was smaller than the expected value . nevertheless the fractionation pattern resembled that of indicating that cleavage of _METHOD_ if it occurred did not affect its localization . similar distribution profiles between _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and and between _METHOD_ and suggest that tagging with the _METHOD_ reporter did not alter the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ and . in addition these results indicate that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are _PROTEIN_ associated with the _LOCATION_ that floated to the top part of the iodixanol gradients while _PROTEIN_ is also localized to the _LOCATION_ contained in fraction m. next fractionation patterns of marker proteins for the tonoplasts the _LOCATION_ and the _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ were analyzed . as illustrated in fig ref and fig ref two typical tonoplast proteins h inorganic pyrophosphatase and _METHOD_ were _PROTEIN_ detected in fraction t. thus both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are predominantly distributed to the fractions . on the other hand an _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ protein _PROTEIN_ was found to be fractionated _PROTEIN_ to fraction m although it was faintly detected in fraction t when overexposed . similarly the _LOCATION_ marker protein _METHOD_ was also predominantly fractionated into fraction m . this lumenal soluble protein was also detected in fraction l probably due to a leak upon disruption of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . the fractionation pattern of the _LOCATION_ marker _METHOD_ is shown in fig ref . the _METHOD_ antibody detected two bands around the position of the expected molecular _METHOD_ but both bands showed a similar fractionation profile . they were predominantly found in fraction m although they were also weakly detected in fraction t. the overall fractionation pattern of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ was found to be similar to that of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ marker _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was distributed in a wide range of the _LOCATION_ fractions and showed relatively strong signals in fractions t and m . taken together fraction t where both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were _PROTEIN_ detected was abundant in the tonoplasts while fraction m in which _PROTEIN_ but not _PROTEIN_ was detected at a significant level contained _LOCATION_ from several different organelles . to rule out the possibility that the buoyant densities of intracellular _LOCATION_ in cells differ from those in a.thaliana cells we examined the fractionation patterns of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ using a.thaliana cells . the fractionation patterns of these proteins were identical with their respective patterns obtained using cells . all these findings suggest that both _PROTEIN_ and are localized predominantly to the tonoplasts . this is consistent with the confocal images illustrating the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ . the _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ in fraction m remains to be determined . previously we have detected the interaction between _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ and the helicase domain polypeptides of the proteins of two tobamoviruses and using the yeast sos recruitment system . recently we have found that interacts with _PROTEIN_ in yeast split ubiquitin system . based on these observations we have proposed that the tom proteins and tobamovirus proteins are integral parts of the tobamoviral rna replication complex on _LOCATION_ . to test this possibility we investigated subcellular distribution of the proteins of and compared their localization with that of the tom proteins . protoplasts isolated from cells were inoculated with rna . cells at h were disrupted and subjected to iodixanol gradient flotation analysis . the antibody against the helicase domain polypeptide of was used to detect both and proteins . in protoplasts _PROTEIN_ and showed similar fractionation patterns to those described for cells . in protoplasts two different types of fractionation patterns were obtained . representative patterns of four out of seven independent inoculations are shown in fig ref while those of the other three inoculations are shown in fig ref . in infect the patterns of _PROTEIN_ and the tom proteins were similar to those in protoplasts . while most of the proteins of remained in fraction l they also floated up to the _LOCATION_ fractions . among these fractions strong signals of the proteins were detected in fractions t and m resembling the fractionation pattern of . in infect distinctive fractionation patterns of and the proteins were observed . in addition to the signals observed in infect strong signals for and but not _PROTEIN_ were detected in fractions and . since these proteins were not detected or detected at only a very low level in the corresponding fractions of protoplasts it appeared that the buoyant density of part of the tonoplasts was altered upon infection . remarkably relatively large amounts of the proteins were also detected in fractions and indicating that the proteins are tethered to the _LOCATION_ found in these fractions . we found that the _LOCATION_ proteins of were abundant in fractions t and m. in addition large amounts of the proteins also existed in fraction l where proteins remained . to investigate whether each fraction contained the functional replication complex to synthesize the viral rna the fractions shown in fig ref and c were subjected to an rdrp assay to detect the incorporation of ribonucleotides into the replicative form rna of . the bottom panels of fig ref and fig ref show the rf rna produced in each fraction . no rf rna bands were detected in protoplast samples indicating that the bands were . in both infect and infect the viral rdrp activity was _PROTEIN_ present in fractions t and m. furthermore fractions and in infect showed higher rdrp activity than those in infect . the rdrp activity was not detected in fraction l in either case despite the abundance of the proteins . the quantification of the signal intensity of the rf rna and the protein bands clearly demonstrated that the peaks for the viral rdrp activity and the _LOCATION_ replication protein were located in the same fractions . these observations suggest that the active tobamovirus replication complex is localized on the _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ .

of the start codon of the _METHOD_ open reading frame was used to construct _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ . because of the presence of a bamhi site in the coding sequence of the _PROTEIN_ gene the polymerase chain reaction was used to introduce a bglii site upstream of the start codon and to replace the stop codon with a linker sequence encoding four glycine codons followed by a bglii site . the resulting
