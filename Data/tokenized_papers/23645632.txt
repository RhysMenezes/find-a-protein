protein ubiquitination is involved in most cellular processes . in arabidopsis ubiquitin mediated protein degradation regulates the stability of key components of the circadian clock feedback loops and the photoperiodic flowering pathway . here we identified two ubiquitin specific proteases _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ involved in circadian clock and photoperiodic flowering regulation . double mutants of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ display pleiotropic phenotypes including early flowering and short periodicity of circadian _METHOD_ . in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ transcript rises earlier than that of wild type plants during the day which leads to increased _PROTEIN_ of flowering locus t. this and analysis of _PROTEIN_ co mutants indicates that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ regulate photoperiodic flowering through a _PROTEIN_ dependent pathway . in addition _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ regulate the circadian rhythm of clock genes including _PROTEIN_ elongated hypocotyl circadian _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ of cab _PROTEIN_ . furthermore _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are circadian controlled . therefore our work reveals a role for two deubiquitinases _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in the control of the circadian clock and photoperiodic flowering which extends our understanding of ubiquitin in daylength measurement in higher plants .
_PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are two arabidopsis homologs of human ubiquitin specific protease _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ share high amino acid sequence similarity with sequence identity suggesting that their function may be redundant . they also share amino acid sequence identity with _PROTEIN_ and have the conserved cys and his box signature motifs indicating that they have potential deubiquitination activity . at the n termini these three proteins contain a meprin and tumor necrosis _PROTEIN_ receptor associated _PROTEIN_ homology domain which is not found in other arabidopsis ubp proteins . to determine whether _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ have deubiquitination activity in vitro we performed enzymatic activity assays using the hexameric polyubiquitin protein _PROTEIN_ and ubiquitin extension protein _PROTEIN_ which bears the amino acid ribosomal protein appended to a single ubiquitin moiety as substrates . when wild type _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ and their mutant _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in which conserved cys of the enzymatic active sites were substituted by ser were coexpressed with _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in escherichia coli as described we can detect the cleaved products by immunoblotting analysis with ubiquitin antibody . the wild type _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were capable of cleaving ubiquitin from both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . however neither of the mutants _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ showed any enzymatic activity indicating that activities of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were dependent on the conserved cys residue . this result is consistent with previous findings that _PROTEIN_ can remove ubiquitin from lys linked ubiquitin chain . all of these results demonstrate that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are bona fide dubs in arabidopsis . to figure out the biological functions of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in plant development we first determined _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ patterns by examining the gus signal in transgenic plants with gus _PROTEIN_ under the control of the _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ promoter . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were both _PROTEIN_ in the hypocotyl cotyledon leaf root and inflorescence especially in the vascular part of these tissues . however a few differences were observed . first _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ in hypocotyl and cotyledon of d old plants whereas _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in hypocotyl but not cotyledon of d old seedlings . second in flowers _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ in carpel sepal and pollen whereas _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ only in the pollen . the highly overlapping _PROTEIN_ patterns of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis suggest that they may be functionally redundant in regulating plant development . to examine the subcellular localizations of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ proteins we generated green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ and cyan _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . in _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgenic plants we observed that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were located in both cytoplasm and _LOCATION_ which was similar to the _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ alone in _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ transgenic plants . moreover we detected the _PROTEIN_ protein in separated cytoplasmic or _LOCATION_ fractions using ubp antibodies . consistent with our observation in these transgenic plants the _PROTEIN_ can be detected in both cytoplasm and _LOCATION_ though more _PROTEIN_ can be detected in the cytoplasm . these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ might affect substrates in both the cytoplasmic and _LOCATION_ compartments . to investigate the biological functions of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ we isolated mutants from transfer dna insertion populations of arabidopsis . two insertional mutants of _PROTEIN_ were identified and the alleles were named as _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ the alleles contain t dna insertions in exons and respectively . three mutant alleles of _PROTEIN_ were identified and designated as _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . t dnas were inserted in the fifth and exons of these three mutants respectively . by northern blot analysis no accumulation of full length _PROTEIN_ mrna was detected in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutant plants and no full length _PROTEIN_ mrna was detected in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . however one smaller segment was found in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutant plants suggesting that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are not null alleles for _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ . in the _PROTEIN_ mutant surprisingly the mrna level of _PROTEIN_ was also _PROTEIN_ which might result from high transcription of the primer region of _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ causing suppression of _PROTEIN_ in trans indicating that _PROTEIN_ is a weak double mutant although there is only one t dna insertion in the genome . therefore we named it as _PROTEIN_ . different from other single mutants with no obvious developmental phenotypes the _PROTEIN_ exhibited distinct phenotypes including small plants round leaves short petioles dwarfism and more branches after bolting . the similar _PROTEIN_ patterns of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ indicate that they could have redundant biological functions in regulating plant development . to test this we generated double mutants and obtained _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . all these double mutants displayed similar but much more severe phenotypes than _PROTEIN_ including smaller plants rounder leaves shorter petioles at seedling stage more severe dwarf statures and more bushy plants at mature stage . among these viable double mutants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ showed weakest developmental phenotypes in every aspect we observed which is consistent with the _PROTEIN_ that partial transcripts can be detected in _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ . fertility of all these double mutants was dramatically _PROTEIN_ . only _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ set enough seeds for further research whereas _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was completely infertile . the homozygous _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutants could not be obtained suggesting that these two genes are important for arabidopsis embryo development and/or male/female gametophyte function . taken together we conclude that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are involved in diverse developmental processes . in addition to the developmental patterning defects of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ the single mutants of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and the double mutant _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ also showed early flowering phenotype under both long day _PROTEIN_ and short day conditions compared with wild type plants . the phenotypes were profounder under sd . the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutant flowered after forming only about leaves under sd which is similar to the mutants under _PROTEIN_ condition indicating that the double mutant is insensitive to photoperiod . the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant also showed early flowering if only according to leaf numbers . however _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ displayed drastic developmental retardation under _PROTEIN_ and sd suggesting that it is not reasonable for us to analyze the flowering time . taken together these results indicate that dubs _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are involved in the photoperiodic floral transition pathway . in arabidopsis transcriptional regulation of _PROTEIN_ is crucial for daylength measurement . _PROTEIN_ is activated under proper daylength and subsequently up regulates the _PROTEIN_ of flowering locus t _PROTEIN_ to promote flowering . changes in _PROTEIN_ transcription are the key of many daylength insensitive mutants . to determine if the early flowering phenotype caused by mutations of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ depends on _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ we measured _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ transcripts by quantitative reverse transcription pcr at h intervals for h under both _PROTEIN_ and sd conditions . in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutants the _PROTEIN_ level of _PROTEIN_ started to increase at or h after dawn which was earlier than that in wild type plants under both _PROTEIN_ and sd conditions . this led to elevated _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ during the day and then activated _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ which was more evident in the sd condition . by contrast the transcription of _PROTEIN_ was not affected in _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ single and double mutants . these results indicate that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ act in the photoperiodic flowering pathway by regulating _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ transcriptions . genetic analysis of _PROTEIN_ co double mutants further supported our results . both the _PROTEIN_ co double mutants and co single mutants flowered after forming around leaves but the _PROTEIN_ mutant flowered with only around leaves under _PROTEIN_ condition . this indicates that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ act upstream of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is an upstream regulator of _PROTEIN_ and positively regulates _PROTEIN_ transcription . so we also analyzed _PROTEIN_ gi mutants and found that they flowered as _PROTEIN_ as gi plants indicating that _PROTEIN_ is also downstream of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in regulating photoperiodic flowering . we also tested one mads box protein involved in photoperiodic flowering regulation short vegetative phase _PROTEIN_ which negatively regulates _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in a _PROTEIN_ independent manner . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ showed earlier flowering than and _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ under _PROTEIN_ condition indicating that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ regulate photoperiodic flowering in parallel . these genetic interactions suggest that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ regulate flowering time through _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . in the photoperiodic flowering pathway the circadian oscillators take part in the daylength measurement by regulating _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . the plant circadian clock is composed of multiple feedback loops . in arabidopsis two myb transcription _PROTEIN_ circadian _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ elongated hypocotyl _PROTEIN_ are _PROTEIN_ in the morning . they can bind to the promoter of the evening gene _PROTEIN_ of cab _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ to repress its transcription . in turn _PROTEIN_ regulates the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ as a repressor . we examined whether mutation of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ affects circadian rhythm and the _PROTEIN_ patterns of these core clock genes . the rhythmic accumulations of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were tested by qrt pcr in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutants . under constant white light free running condition the periods of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were shortened by h in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutants compared with that of wild type plants . in addition the transcription level of _PROTEIN_ was obviously increased in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutants . moreover the period of _PROTEIN_ promoter luciferase circadian rhythm was also shortened by h in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutants compared with the wild type . taken together these results indicate that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ function in the periodic control of the _PROTEIN_ of core clock oscillators in arabidopsis . then we tested whether _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are _METHOD_ circadianly regulated . mrna levels of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ oscillated under ll condition . the transcripts of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ increased and reached their highest level at h and then _PROTEIN_ and reached their lowest level around h . accumulation of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ proteins was also highest at h and lowest at h which is similar to their mrna levels . these results demonstrate that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are under circadian control . taken together we show that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are essential for proper circadian rhythm .
