the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ is an important compartment that undergoes dynamic changes in composition upon external or internal stimuli . the dynamic subcompartmentation of proteins in ordered low density and disordered high density _LOCATION_ phases is hypothesized to require interactions with cytoskeletal components . here we systematically analyzed the effects of actin or tubulin disruption on the distribution of proteins between _LOCATION_ density phases . we used a proteomic screen to identify candidate proteins with altered submembrane location followed by biochemical or cell biological characterization in arabidopsis thaliana . we found that several proteins such as _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ receptor kinases or remorins resulted in a differential distribution between _LOCATION_ density phases upon cytoskeletal disruption . moreover in most cases contrasting effects were observed disruption of actin filaments largely led to a redistribution of proteins from drm to dsm _LOCATION_ fractions while disruption of tubulins resulted in general depletion of proteins from the _LOCATION_ . we conclude that actin filaments are necessary for dynamic movement of proteins between different _LOCATION_ phases and that microtubules are not necessarily important for formation of microdomains as such but rather they may control the protein amount present in the _LOCATION_ phases .
the aim of this study was to characterize effects of cytoskeletal disruption on protein distribution between low density sterol rich microdomains and general other higher density _LOCATION_ phases . two major phytosterols sitosterol and campesterol were identified and quantified in drm and dsm fractions with generally higher values in drm fractions . generally these sterols contribute to about of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ lipids . no other typical _LOCATION_ sterols were identified but rather organic acids sugars alkanes and many unidentified compounds containing an alkyl group were characterized in the gc tof analysis . in both fractions a variety of soluble compounds like ethyl hexanoic acid hydroxy pyridine octadecane diethylene glycol boric acid or phosphoric acid were detected . these other compounds may have masked the detection of other lower abundant lipids . most of these substances except for ethanolamine were considered as copurifying contaminants since they were not known to be _LOCATION_ components . the cytoskeletal disruption did not result in statistically significant relative and absolute changes in any of the identified substances . both sterols grouped in the same hierarchical cluster of compounds . the level of sterols in drm as well as in dsm fractions remained unaltered in response to cytochalasin d and oryzalin treatment and as expected sterol levels were higher on average in drm fractions . thus we conclude that disruption of actin filaments or disruption of microtubules does not cause a drastic change in _LOCATION_ sterol composition . detergent resistant _LOCATION_ preparations are prone to copurifying nonsterol dependent proteins and may be considered an enrichment but not a purification of sterol rich _LOCATION_ microdomains . in order to robustly establish a filter for identification of true effects of cytoskeletal disruption on changes in protein distribution between cellular _LOCATION_ phases reference protein lists of know sterol dependent proteins as well as from intracellular _LOCATION_ proteins and soluble proteins were established . in the cytochalasin d experimental series proteins were identified in drm fractions a total of proteins were identified in dsm fractions and and proteins were identified from intracellular _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ and as soluble proteins . for oryzalin treatment experiments proteins were identified in detergent resistant _LOCATION_ proteins in detergent soluble _LOCATION_ proteins in intracellular _LOCATION_ and proteins as soluble proteins from two biological replicates . separation quality of cellular fractions was confirmed by the _PROTEIN_ that in almost all fractions collected a large number of proteins was identified in a single fraction only . the largest overlap between collected fractions was represented by the proteins from neighboring compartments for example or proteins overlapping between drm and dsm fractions while only or one protein was in common for detergent resistant _LOCATION_ and soluble fraction . the identified proteins were then assigned to expected cellular location based on _PROTEIN_ . as expected in both drug treatment series the majority of proteins identified in the drm fraction had a _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ location while proteins identified in the _PROTEIN_ fraction largely were of mitochondrial _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ location . the sol fraction contained the highest amount of soluble proteins . furthermore filtering out all proteins that were found in more than one fraction enriched the fraction specific protein groups at an even higher degree . in further analyses proteins were excluded if their abundance was highest in _PROTEIN_ or sol fractions even when detected in drm or dsf fractions . this filtering procedure was validated in detail in a previous study . to confirm the specificity of cytochalasin d and oryzalin treatment on the disruption of actin filaments and tubulins respectively the disappearance of actin or tubulin protein in the drm fraction was monitored . cytochalasin d treatment depleted the sample from _PROTEIN_ within min of treatment but a less strong effect was observed for _PROTEIN_ . oryzalin treatment efficiently depleted different tubulin _METHOD_ from the drm fraction in a concentration dependent manner . secondly specificity of the drug treatment was monitored using the dual labeled line for actin and tubulin . cytochalasin d treatment of h was already enough to significantly disrupt the majority of actin filaments but some actin strands still remained visible . microtubule structures were not affected by the cytochalasin d treatment . oryzalin treatment at a concentration of for h completely disintegrated typical microtubule structures while actin filaments remained intact . thus the drug treatments applied in our experiments specifically affected only one component of the _LOCATION_ . cluster analysis of the abundance profiles of drm proteins in response to cytochalasin d time course treatment revealed five major response groups . the largest number of proteins was found in cluster with a tendency for an increase of abundance in response to the treatment . however these were _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ proteins and very few _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ proteins . the cluster with the highest fraction of _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ proteins was cluster with a tendency of _PROTEIN_ abundance in the drm fraction . clusters with a high content of _LOCATION_ proteins particularly contained proteins involved in protein synthesis . such proteins are known copurifying proteins in drm preparations . in contrast clusters and with high fraction of _LOCATION_ proteins particularly were rich in proteins with transport and signaling functions . similarly oryzalin treatment over the range of concentrations resulted in differential responses of proteins which could be separated into five response clusters containing to proteins . proteins in cluster showed an increased abundance with increased concentration of oryzalin but these were particularly proteins with _LOCATION_ location such as ribosomal proteins . proteins in two clusters with a high fraction of _LOCATION_ proteins displayed a _PROTEIN_ abundance profile in drm with increasing oryzalin concentration but at different slope . these clusters were particularly enriched in proteins with signaling function or transporters . however cytochalasin d or oryzalin treatment of cell cultures did not affect global protein abundance levels and distribution of proteins identified in the _PROTEIN_ and sol fractions . these findings suggest that the observed drug induced protein abundance changes for proteins identified in drm and dsm fractions were _PROTEIN_ due to local redistributions within the _LOCATION_ and not due to global redistributions between compartments based on disturbed _LOCATION_ trafficking . in order to identify candidate drm proteins significantly affected by the cytoskeletal disruptions three filtering criteria were applied to the above data set proteins were required to be identified in drm fractions in at least one replicate of this study proteins were required to show significant response to drug treatment _PROTEIN_ and have evidence for sterol dependent _LOCATION_ location from previous work . based on these criteria for cytochalasin d treatment from the proteins identified in drm fractions only proteins had previously been confirmed also as sterol dependent proteins . for oryzalin treatment out of proteins identified in drm fractions proteins were also characterized as sterol dependent . from this overlap proteins were found to significantly display an altered abundance distribution between drm and dsf upon cytochalasin d treatment and proteins were found to significantly change their distribution profile in response to oryzalin . in most cases _LOCATION_ disruption particularly treatment with cytochalasin d induced a reduced abundance of proteins in sterol enriched drm fractions with an accompanied increased abundance of that protein in the sterol depleted dsm fraction . this may indicate that these proteins within the _LOCATION_ moved from sterol enriched phases into sterol depleted _LOCATION_ phases particularly after disruption of actin filaments . out of the proteins with significantly altered distribution between drm and dsm upon cytochalasin d treatment there were eight proteins involved in _LOCATION_ transport four signaling proteins two oxidases two proteins with functions in stress responses a remorin protein and few others with unassigned functions . among the proteins with significant response to oryzalin we found seven transporters three signaling proteins a remorin one protein involved in abiotic stress responses and one protein with unspecified role in plant development . among all these proteins nine proteins showed altered distribution between drm and dsm upon both treatments namely disruption of actin filaments as well as upon disruption of microtubules . thereby six proteins _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were depleted from drm in both drugs one protein _PROTEIN_ increased in drm fractions upon both drugs and two proteins _PROTEIN_ showed opposite behavior upon actin or microtubule disruption . among the proteins with significantly altered drm/dsm distribution profiles we identified members of the h _PROTEIN_ family _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . to study the biochemical effect of altered _LOCATION_ phase recruitment enzymatic activity assays were carried out in control and drug treated cells . thereby the activity measurements of the sterol rich drm fractions were compared with activity measurements of total _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ to relate differences in activity to differences in submembrane location . cytochalasin d treatment lead to a depletion of all three _METHOD_ of the h _PROTEIN_ from the sterol rich drm preparations and this was accompanied with an increase in the measured _PROTEIN_ activity in that fraction especially in cytochalasin d treatments of h . activity measured in total _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ remained unaltered upon the disruption of actin filaments and was generally lower than in sterol rich drm fractions . these findings suggest that actin filament disruption leads to recruitment of h _PROTEIN_ molecules from more rigid drm fractions to dsm and this relocation is associated with an increased activity of the protein remaining in drm . in contrast oryzalin treatment also removed _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ from the drm fraction but no accompanied increase in dsm was observed . the disruption of microtubules with oryzalin lead to a _PROTEIN_ h _PROTEIN_ activity in the drm fraction and increased activity levels in the whole _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . it _METHOD_ that microtubule disruption removed the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ from drm fractions without associated relocation to dsm . in general based on the enzyme activity measurements in combination with the resulting abundance distribution between drm and dsm we conclude that alterations in the location of proteins within _LOCATION_ phases may significantly affect their activity either through changes in abundance or by creating activating/inactivating interaction environment . the receptor kinase _PROTEIN_ was found to be depleted from drm upon treatment with cytochalasin d as well as upon treatment with oryzalin . the effects of drug treatment on location of _PROTEIN_ were analyzed using arabidopsis seedlings _PROTEIN_ a _METHOD_ fusion under the promoter . in untreated seedlings _PROTEIN_ showed more or less uniform distribution across the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . interestingly the uniform distribution of _METHOD_ signal was exempt in line shaped regions resembling the cellular pattern of microtubule strands . we suggest that these exempt darker areas follow the distribution of microtubules below the _LOCATION_ bilayer . this statement is supported by the finding that we did not record such distribution in oryzalin treated seedlings whereas it was still visible after treatment with cytochalasin d. occasionally locations in punctate patterns were visible . treatment of cells with cytochalasin d did not lead to large overall changes in location pattern of _PROTEIN_ but enhanced the appearance of the punctate location . treatment with oryzalin resulted in a more uniform pattern losing the _LOCATION_ negative print in the location pattern and resulting in smaller punctate structures . remorins are _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ proteins that were shown to locate to sterol rich _LOCATION_ microdomains using cell biological and biochemical approaches and they are highly enriched in drm preparation . in our experiments cytoskeletal disruptions led to altered distributions of remorin _PROTEIN_ between drm and dsm . these findings from the large scale proteomic approach were confirmed by protein gel blot analysis of four fractions across the sucrose gradient separating sterol rich drm from sterol depleted dsm . particularly when actin filaments were disintegrated by cytochalasin d treatment remorin abundance clearly _PROTEIN_ in drm fractions and increased in dsm . disruption of microtubules by oryzalin also led to a depletion of remorins _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ from drm but the accompanied increase in dsm was less prominent compared with the observations in cytochalasin d treatment . location of _PROTEIN_ in untreated arabidopsis seedlings was found in punctate patterns as observed previously . treatment with cytochalasin d completely disrupted this punctate location pattern to a more uniform distribution with smaller punctate patterns of lower intensity . in contrast treatment with oryzalin enhanced punctate location of _PROTEIN_ to bigger dots of higher intensity .

. homozygous lines of a. thaliana _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ tagged leucin rich repeat receptor like kinase _PROTEIN_ _GENE_ under promoter were obtained as a courtesy from xuna wu university of hohenheim germany . seeds of an a. thaliana dual labeled line for actin and tubulin were obtained as a courtesy of _PROTEIN_ persson from the max planck institute of molecular plant physiology in golm germany . this line allowed observation of the structure of microtubules and actin filaments in the same plant at the same time . the dual labeled line was created by transformation of col with vector containing _METHOD_ fusion construct under promoter together with a gene for kanamycin resistance . this line was subsequently crossed with another line that was transformed with a gateway vector containing _PROTEIN_ fused to mcherry _METHOD_ under promoter together with genes for kanamycin resistance . sterilized seeds of _METHOD_ tagged remorin lines were grown on murashige skoog medium containing agarose sucrose and kanamycin . seedlings transferred on plates were left for days in a light dark cycle with a h photoperiod at . prior to the performed experiments seedlings were carefully moved into the cavity of a six well plate filled with liquid _METHOD_ medium with sucrose and placed on a rotary shaker . cell suspension cultures were established from a. thaliana col leaf callus as described . they were grown in flasks in full jpl medium under constant light conditions at mol at with rotary shaking at rpm . cells were subcultured every days . in order to perform experiments cell cultures were pooled from and independent flask and subsequently divided into desired numbers of replicates for treatment . in general treatment experiments were carried out in at least three biological replicates and results are presented as an average of these . experiments were performed with cytochalasin d which is a potent inhibitor of actin polymerization . cytochalasin d binds to g actin and prevents polymerization of actin monomers as well as to the barbed end of actin filaments which inhibits the association of hew monomers at that end . the second drug used in the experiments was oryzalin which is a selective pre emergence surface applied dinitroaniline herbicide with rather low toxicity to animals and fungi . this drug acts as a microtubule depolymerizing agent and it perturbs all microtubule related processes in plant cells . both inhibitory effects were shown to be reversible . stock solutions of cytochalasin d and oryzalin were dissolved in _METHOD_ . the following experimental conditions were applied cytochalasin d treatment cells treated with cytochalasin d may react to the loss of the links between the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and actin filaments by creating more filaments that might compensate for the initial depolymerizing effect of cytochalasin d . in order to evaluate this effect time points instead of different concentrations were used . cell cultures were treated with cytochalasin d in concentration of nm for different periods min min min and min . the concentration used was far lower than the minimal concentration known to disrupt cytoplasmic streaming . control samples were treated with respective volumes of _METHOD_ solution . the concentration of _METHOD_ in final solutions was not higher than . after treatment cells were filtered and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen . oryzalin treatment according to the literature oryzalin has an impact on the normal structure of the microtubules already at nanomolar concentrations but often requiring long exposure . in order to perform experiments at similar time frames as the cytochalasin d treatment we selected increasing oryzalin concentrations applied for the duration of h. cell cultures were treated with different concentrations of oryzalin for h. instead of a disrupting agent respective amount of _METHOD_ was added to control samples . the concentration of _METHOD_ in final solutions was not higher than . after treatment cells were filtered and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen . activity of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ h _PROTEIN_ in drm and dsm fractions was measured by the malachite green colorimetric assay . the standardization of different samples was based on total protein content which was evaluated by the nanoorange protein quantitation kit according to the instructions . specific inhibitors of p type and v type _PROTEIN_ were used to distinguish the specific activity of selected enzyme from the background activity of the sample as _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ inhibitor edta as inhibition of _PROTEIN_ as inhibition of mitochondrial _PROTEIN_ and bafilomycin as inhibitor of v _PROTEIN_ . in order to perform enzymatic activity measurement of extracted protein was used per reaction mixture . the plate was placed on a shaker at . reaction was stopped after or h by adding mg am _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ solubilized in tne buffer the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ was subsequently treated with triton x in a concentration between and and in a ratio of proteins to triton of . the detergent treatment was applied for min on ice with shaking . detergent resistant and detergent soluble _LOCATION_ created after triton x were separated by centrifugation for h through a sucrose step gradient . after centrifugation a low density band was observed as a white _PROTEIN_ at the interface of the m and m sucrose phases . a fraction of ml containing the _PROTEIN_ was collected as drm fraction and ml from the bottom of the gradient was collected as dsm fraction . for _METHOD_ _METHOD_ proteins from collected fractions were purified by methanol chloroform method . initially four volumes of methanol one volume of chloroform and three volumes of water were added to the sample and after each addition the sample was vortexed . next the sample was centrifuged for min at room temperature . the upper phase was removed and the lower phase was diluted with three volumes of methanol . protein was then pelleted by centrifugation for min at maximum speed . for enzymatic measurements the recovery of proteins from collected sucrose gradient fractions was based on dissolving the dense sucrose with large volumes of buffer tne and subsequently pelleting _LOCATION_ by ultracentrifugation at g for h. purified proteins from preceding steps were dissolved in m m thiourea ph which causes denaturation of proteins . subsequently disulfide bonds were released by treatment with dtt and spontaneous oxidation was prevented by _PROTEIN_ with iodoacetamide . lys c and trypsin were applied for the digestion of proteins and creation of low molecular weight tryptic peptides as described . after trypsin digestion samples were desalted on stop and go extraction tips dried in a vacuum concentrator and resuspended in trifluoroacetic acid acetonitrile just before loading onto the liquid chromatography column . digested and desalted peptides were analyzed by _METHOD_ using nanoflow hplc and an orbitrap hybrid _METHOD_ spectrometer as _METHOD_ analyzer . peptides were eluted from a cm long m wide analytical column filled with beads on a linear gradient running from to acetonitrile in min at a flow rate of nl/min and sprayed directly into the _METHOD_ spectrometer . proteins were identified by tandem _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ by information dependent acquisition of fragmentation spectra of multiple charged peptides . up to five data dependent _METHOD_ spectra were acquired in the linear ion trap for each _METHOD_ full scan spectrum acquired at full width half maximum resolution settings with an overall cycle time of s. for raw file peak extraction and protein identification we used maxquant software with a. thaliana protein sequences used by the search engine andromeda . the following additional parameters were applied trypsin as cleaving enzyme ppm peptide _METHOD_ tolerance da _METHOD_ tolerance maximal two missed cleavages allowed threshold for validation of peptides set to using a _PROTEIN_ database acetylation at n terminal of proteins and oxidation of methionine set as variable modification _PROTEIN_ of cysteine set as a fixed modification label free quantification marked match between runs marked minimum peptide length of six amino acids and retention time correlation enabled . spectra of identified peptides are available in supplemental fig . . known contaminants such as keratins were excluded from further analysis . peptide lists derived from maxquant were processed by an r based script allowing for automated and standardized processing . peptides with the assigned maxquant score below and peptides that were quantified in less than of all fraction specific samples were filtered out . the principal steps of the normalization and quantitation were all peptide intensities within each sample were normalized to fraction of total ion intensity _METHOD_ . to compensate effects of normalization due to the number of detected peptides per sample intensity was proportionally corrected to the reciprocal number of identified peptides in each sample using the integrated normalization option in cracker . peptide intensities with missing values in more than the permitted numbers of samples within replicates of each fraction were filtered out . outliers exclusion was used to lower the influence of extreme peptide intensity values on the average protein intensity . remaining normalized peptide intensities were z score scaled and mean averaged . protein concentration in different fractions after chloroform/methanol extraction was evaluated by nanoorange according to the instructions and equal amounts of proteins per sample were loaded onto polyacrylamide gels . _PROTEIN_ polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and protein gel blots were performed as described . the _LOCATION_ was blocked in blocking solution overnight at and was subsequently washed three times with _PROTEIN_ t and _PROTEIN_ incubated with the primary antibody _METHOD_ at the concentration of in _PROTEIN_ t for h at room temperature . after additional washing steps the secondary antibody alkaline phosphatase coupled anti mouse igg was used at the concentration of in _PROTEIN_ t for h at room temperature . for detection of the signal blots were incubated in alkaline phosphatase detection buffer with addition of bromo chloro indolyphosphate p toluidine salt and nitro blue tetrazolium chloride . after density gradient centrifugation for the separation of drm and dsm a volume of ml for the low density band as well as ml from the bottom of the gradient was transferred to the clean ml falcon tube . for each ml of sample of mm hydroxy cholestane was added which reflected of this compound and served as an internal standard . lipids were extracted by the chloroform methanol method . to each sample ml of were added then ml of and finally ml of water . tubes were vortexed thoroughly after each solvent addition . the final mixture was centrifuged at g for min at room temperature which resulted in a separation into upper aqueous and bottom organic phases . the aqueous solution was removed using a pasteur pipette and the organic phase was washed with authentic upper phase . the cleaned organic phase was subsequently transferred in batches of to a smaller tube and dried in a vacuum concentrator . by repeatedly drying down small volumes the spread of extracted lipids around the whole inner surface of the tube was minimized . the profiling of soluble metabolites was performed as described previously by gas chromatography coupled to electron impact ionization/time of flight _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . dried lipid species were methoxyaminated and trimethylsilylated manually prior to gc ei/tof _METHOD_ analysis . analysis was performed using an agilent gas chromatograph with splitless injection onto a _PROTEIN_ vf _METHOD_ capillary column m length mm inner diameter m film _PROTEIN_ connected to a pegasus iii time of flight _METHOD_ spectrometer _PROTEIN_ . retention indices were calibrated by addition of a _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and n alkane mixture to each sample . gc ei/tof _METHOD_ _METHOD_ were acquired visually controlled baseline corrected and exported in netcdf file format using chromatof software _PROTEIN_ . gc _METHOD_ data processing into a standardized numerical data _PROTEIN_ and compound identification were performed using the tagfinder software . compounds were identified by _METHOD_ spectral and retention time index matching to the reference collection of the golm metabolome database . guidelines for manually supervised metabolite identification were the presence of at least three specific _METHOD_ fragments per compound and a retention index deviation within . all _METHOD_ features of an experiment were normalized by sample fresh weight internal standard _PROTEIN_ and were then maximum scaled . _METHOD_ imaging shown in the study was performed as described below . the _METHOD_ signal of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and mcherry was recorded using leica tcs system coupled with inverted light microscope and hcx pl apo w _PROTEIN_ objective . the excitation was achieved using nm argon laser for _METHOD_ nm argon laser for _METHOD_ and nm diode laser for mcherry . resulting emission was separated using triple dichroic td for _METHOD_ dichroic rsp for _METHOD_
