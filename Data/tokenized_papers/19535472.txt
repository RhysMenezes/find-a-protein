using a newly developed abscisic acid affinity chromatography technique we showed that the magnesium chelatase h subunit _PROTEIN_ specifically binds aba through the c terminal half but not the n terminal half . a set of potential agonists/antagonists to aba including trans aba gibberellin cytokinin like regulator benzylaminopurine auxin indole acetic acid auxin like substance naphthalene acetic acid and jasmonic acid methyl ester did not bind _PROTEIN_ . a c terminal truncated _PROTEIN_ with amino acid residues was shown to bind aba which may be a core of the aba binding domain in the c terminal half . consistently _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ c terminal half truncated proteins fused with green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ in wild type plants conferred aba hypersensitivity in all major aba responses including seed germination postgermination growth and stomatal movement and the _PROTEIN_ of the same truncated proteins fused with _METHOD_ in an aba insensitive cch mutant of the _PROTEIN_ gene restored the aba sensitivity of the mutant in all of the aba responses . however the effect of _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ n terminal half fused with _METHOD_ in the wild type plants was limited to seedling growth and the restoring effect of the aba sensitivity of the cch mutant was limited to seed germination . in addition we identified two new mutant alleles of _PROTEIN_ from the mutant pool in the arabidopsis biological resource center via arabidopsis targeting induced local lesions in genomes . the _PROTEIN_ mutant has a point mutation resulting in the n terminal leu and the _PROTEIN_ mutant has a point mutation resulting in the n terminal ser . the two mutants show altered aba related phenotypes in seed germination and postgermination growth but not in stomatal movement . these findings support the idea that _PROTEIN_ is an aba receptor and reveal that the c terminal half of _PROTEIN_ plays a central role in aba signaling which is consistent with its aba binding ability but the n terminal half is also functionally required likely through a regulatory action on the c terminal half .
we developed an aba affinity chromatography technique to detect aba binding to a known protein essentially based on our aba binding protein purification procedures . an aba linked sepharose was used to assess qualitatively whether a given protein binds aba . the escherichia coli _PROTEIN_ full length _PROTEIN_ was loaded onto the aba linked sepharose column and first eluted by mm nacl of total volume ml at ml each for times to eliminate completely unspecifically bound or loosely bound protein by the column . it is noteworthy that this eliminated portion by the mm nacl elution should also include a disassociated portion of an aba specific binding protein in the reversible binding process . after this elution the column was further eluted by or mm nacl plus mm aba . this aba affinity competitive elution released efficiently the aba specific binding portion of the _PROTEIN_ protein . in contrast elution with the inactive isomer trans aba could not substantially recover the _PROTEIN_ protein . as a negative control the sepharose column that was not coupled with aba did not bind tightly to the _PROTEIN_ protein . the loosely bound protein was completely removed from the non aba linked column with mm nacl of total volume about ml at ml each for five times and a subsequent elution with mm nacl plus mm aba did not recover any detectable _PROTEIN_ protein . it is noteworthy that the protein eluted by mm nacl from the aba linked column needed in most cases about ml of elution with ml each for nine to times showing that the aba linked column bound the _PROTEIN_ protein specifically and tightly . the mm aba elution with either or mm nacl showed no difference in efficiency in recovering _PROTEIN_ protein from the aba affinity column indicating that this aba specific elution was independent of nacl concentrations in the range from to mm . to further test the specificity of binding of _PROTEIN_ protein to the aba affinity column the _PROTEIN_ protein was incubated with or nm aba in order to compete with the sepharose linked aba for free aba . the aba concentration of nm is slightly lower than the saturation concentration of aba binding to _PROTEIN_ protein . the concentration of the sepharose linked aba was about nm in the binding incubation system equivalent to nm aba . the incubation of _PROTEIN_ protein with nm free aba efficiently _PROTEIN_ the amount of _PROTEIN_ protein eluted from the column and the immunosignal of the _PROTEIN_ protein was undetectable with the nm aba incubation . this competition assay showed that the _PROTEIN_ binding to the aba affinity column is specific . the competition efficiency of the free aba with sepharose bound aba for _PROTEIN_ protein was high likely because the important _PROTEIN_ group at the site of aba is blocked by the sepharose coupling which may _PROTEIN_ the ability of binding to _PROTEIN_ protein in comparison with free aba . in addition to trans aba we used a set of potential agonists/antagonists to aba gibberellin _PROTEIN_ cytokinin like regulator benzylaminopurine auxin indole acetic acid and jasmonic acid methyl ester to elute _PROTEIN_ protein from the aba affinity column in place of aba . however elution with any of these substances did not recover detectable _PROTEIN_ protein showing that these substances are not able to bind the _PROTEIN_ protein . to get further evidence that the arabidopsis natural _PROTEIN_ binds aba the arabidopsis total protein was loaded on the aba linked sepharose and the column was subjected to the same elution procedures mentioned above . the aba affinity competitive elution recovered efficiently the _PROTEIN_ protein from the aba linked sepharose column but not from the aba free column . a competition assay performed with the same procedure as described for the e. coli _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ protein showed that preincubation of the arabidopsis total protein with nm aba _PROTEIN_ significantly the amount of _PROTEIN_ protein eluted from the column and the nm aba preincubation completely eliminated the _PROTEIN_ immunosignal . these results consistent with those of e. coli _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ protein showed that the arabidopsis natural _PROTEIN_ protein is able to bind aba . additionally using this aba affinity column we showed that the e. coli _PROTEIN_ barley xanf binds aba and that in the barley natural proteins both the full length and a truncated xanf bind aba . in rice the two natural _PROTEIN_ both bind aba . to assess aba binding domains in the _PROTEIN_ molecule three truncated _PROTEIN_ proteins were used to perform the aba affinity chromatography assays . the truncated c terminal protein and a fragment located in the portion truncated protein were shown to bind aba . the specificity of aba binding to the truncated protein was assayed using a set of potential agonists/antagonists as for _PROTEIN_ full length protein and the results showed that these potential agonists/antagonists were not able to compete with aba for binding to the truncated protein revealing that the aba binding is specific . however the n terminal truncated protein was removed quickly from the aba linked column by mm nacl elution of which the immunoblotting band disappeared almost completely in the fourth elution by mm nacl while the immunoblotting bands of the and truncated proteins were still retained in the ninth or elution by mm nacl . importantly the truncated protein was not recovered by the aba affinity competitive elution . all of these findings showed that the n terminal truncated protein did not bind aba . the aba binding parameters of the and truncated _PROTEIN_ proteins were assayed by a aba in buffer binding system . the truncated protein binds aba with a kd of nm and maximum binding of mol aba protein and the truncated protein binds aba with a kd of nm and bmax of mol . the mutations of and affected the two aba binding parameters compared with the full length _PROTEIN_ but both the truncated _PROTEIN_ proteins could still perceive aba at the nanomolar level . to test the functional domains of _PROTEIN_ based on the findings from the aba binding assays we first created transgenic lines in the wild type ecotype columbia background using four different constructs of _PROTEIN_ cdna fragments . we previously found that the _PROTEIN_ of the full length _PROTEIN_ open reading frame often caused cosuppression of the _PROTEIN_ gene which made it difficult to obtain transgenic lines . this was also observed by another group . we hypothesized that there might be a sequence responsible for the protein/mrna stability of _PROTEIN_ and tried to use a truncated _PROTEIN_ with the c terminal amino acid residues deleted _PROTEIN_ which indeed made it much easier to obtain transgenic lines . we also tried to use a truncated _PROTEIN_ with n terminal deletion of to amino acid residues covering the chloroplast transit peptide but we failed to obtain transgenic lines therefore we used an n terminal amino acid deleted _PROTEIN_ truncation _PROTEIN_ for transgenic manipulation . the other three constructs included the truncated _PROTEIN_ used in the above mentioned aba binding assays . these truncated _PROTEIN_ were fused with _METHOD_ and shown to correctly _PROTEIN_ in the transgenic lines and localized in chloroplasts except for _PROTEIN_ and which localized in the _LOCATION_ because of lack of the chloroplast transit peptide . _PROTEIN_ of any of the truncated _PROTEIN_ in the wild type background did not affect the contents of mg protoix protoix and chlorophyll of the transgenic lines showing that the chlorophyll biosynthesis was not altered substantially . in contrast the aba sensitivity of these transgenic plants was changed . the transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ the four truncated _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and all showed significantly the aba hypersensitive phenotypes in seed germination postgermination growth and aba induced stomatal closure and aba inhibited stomatal opening . however the transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ the n terminal truncated protein showed substantially wild type phenotypes in seed germination and in postgermination growth when the seeds were planted directly in the aba containing medium while the aba hypersensitivity phenotype in seedling growth was observed in the transgenic plants when the seedlings were transferred to the aba containing medium from the aba free medium h after stratification which suggests the complexity of the _METHOD_ involved in the _PROTEIN_ mediated aba signaling . in aba induced stomatal closure and aba inhibited stomatal opening the transgenic plants showed wild type phenotypes . it is noteworthy that the transformation of the plants with empty vector _METHOD_ did not induce any chlorophyll or aba related phenotypes . we created transgenic lines in the aba insensitive cch mutant background using the same constructs of _PROTEIN_ cdna fragments as in wild type col . molecular analysis showed that the constructs were correctly _PROTEIN_ in the transgenic plants without altering the cch mutation . _PROTEIN_ of two truncated _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and linked to the chloroplast transit peptide enhanced the contents of mg protoix and protoix of the transgenic lines although the contents were still lower than in the wild type plants . however the chlorophyll contents of the transgenic lines were comparable to those in the wild type plants . contrarily _PROTEIN_ of the other three truncated proteins _PROTEIN_ and did not restore the levels of mg protoix protoix and chlorophyll . for the aba related phenotypes _PROTEIN_ of and truncated _PROTEIN_ restored the aba sensitivity in seed germination of the cch mutant while _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and truncated proteins made the cch transgenic seeds hypersensitive to aba compared with the wild type plants . however the _PROTEIN_ of the truncated _PROTEIN_ had no effect on postgermination growth and stomatal movement while the _PROTEIN_ of the other four truncated _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and restored the aba sensitivity in both of the aba major responses . it is noteworthy that the transformation of the cch mutant plants with empty vector did not induce any phenotypic change . we identified two new mutant alleles of the _PROTEIN_ gene _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ from the mutant pool in the arabidopsis biological resource center _PROTEIN_ via the arabidopsis targeting induced local lesions in genomes _PROTEIN_ project . the _PROTEIN_ mutation had a c to t change at nucleotide and _PROTEIN_ had a c to t substitution at nucleotide resulting in leu and ser mutations respectively in _PROTEIN_ protein both of which localize in the n terminal half of the _PROTEIN_ protein . neither of the mutations affects mg protoix and chlorophyll production but both of the mutations alter the aba sensitivity in germination and postgermination growth . the _PROTEIN_ mutant has an aba insensitive phenotype in seed germination like the cch mutant while the _PROTEIN_ mutant has an aba hypersensitive phenotype in seed germination contrary to _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ plants showed a stronger aba insensitive phenotype in postgermination growth like the cch mutant when the seeds were planted directly in the aba containing medium but the _PROTEIN_ plants showed a weaker aba insensitive phenotype in postgermination growth only when postgermination growth was prolonged . however both _PROTEIN_ mutants have substantially no aba related phenotypes in aba induced stomatal closure and aba inhibited stomatal opening .
arabidopsis and the cch mutant of the _PROTEIN_ gene were used in the generation of truncated _PROTEIN_ transgenic plants . truncated _PROTEIN_ genes were amplified by pcr from col cdna with kod plus dna polymerase and cloned into the binary vector which contains the cauliflower mosaic virus promoter and a c terminal _METHOD_ flag . the _PROTEIN_ cdna fragments were isolated by pcr using the forward primer ggactagtatggcttcgcttgtgtattctc and reverse primer ggggtaccactccatcccacagtgttgga for the _PROTEIN_ fragment the forward primer ggactagtatggacaccaatgactcactcaag and reverse primer ggggtacctcgatcgatcccttcgatcttg for the _PROTEIN_ fragment the forward primer ggactagtatggcttcgcttgtgtattctc and reverse primer ggggtaccatcaagattacattgcttagc for the fragment the forward primer ggactagtatgcccatgaggctgcttttctcc and reverse primer ggggtacctcgatcgatcccttcgatcttg for the fragment and the forward primer ggactagtatgcccatgaggctgcttttctcc and reverse primer ggggtacctgttgtgggaatagcctgagg for the fragment . the fragment was then ligated with a chloroplast transit peptide fragment that was isolated using the forward primer ggactagtatggcttcgcttgtgtattctc and reverse primer cggggccctctaagctcctcgaccaagta . all constructs were confirmed by sequencing . these constructs were introduced into the strain of agrobacterium tumefaciens and transformed into plants by floral infiltration . the homozygous seeds of the transgenic plants were used for analysis . at least five transgenic lines were obtained for each construct and all of the lines had similar aba related phenotypes . the results from one representative line are presented in this report . the cch mutant was a generous gift from dr. j. _PROTEIN_ . the seeds of the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants were obtained from the _PROTEIN_ as mentioned below . all of the mutants were isolated from ecotype col . plants were grown in a growth chamber at to on murashige and skoog _METHOD_ medium at about photons or in compost soil at about photons over a h photoperiod . it is particularly noteworthy that the cch mutant was originally identified as a light sensitive mutant deficient in chlorophyll and _PROTEIN_ shown to be insensitive to aba in stomatal movement . so the cch mutant is more susceptible to both strong light and water deficiency than its wild type background col and mild stress conditions to col are probably severe to the cch mutant . we observed that the good growth status of the cch mutant parental plants is of critical importance to their progeny to display the aba related phenotypes the stressed mutant parental plants had progeny with seeds whose insensitive phenotypes to aba became weaker in germination and postgermination growth but the aba insensitive phenotype in stomatal movement was not affected . this may be due to a possible up regulation of aba responsive _METHOD_ independent of _PROTEIN_ mediated signaling which may be induced by environmental stresses imposed on this mutant . the single nucleotide cch mutation in the cch background transgenic lines was identified according to a procedure described previously . a bp fragment was amplified by pcr and a haeiii restriction site was introduced into the wild type sequence corresponding to the cch mutation site while the cch mutation in the fragment results in abolishment of this restriction site . the forward primer used was _PROTEIN_ and the reverse primer was _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants were identified via the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ project . the tilled seeds with predicted deleterious mutations in the _PROTEIN_ gene were provided by the _PROTEIN_ . two lines and _PROTEIN_ were identified as the _PROTEIN_ alleles with the altered phenotypes of aba sensitivity and are designated _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ respectively . _PROTEIN_ had a c to t change at nucleotide . _PROTEIN_ had a c to t substitution at nucleotide . homozygous mutant plants were identified by pcr using allele specific primers designed as described by citation via restriction site analysis . a bp fragment was amplified by pcr using the forward primer _PROTEIN_ and reverse primer tccaccaacaagagcaaaac for analyzing the _PROTEIN_ mutant . an alui restriction site is present in the wild type fragment that can be degraded into and bp fragments while the _PROTEIN_ mutation abolished this restriction site in the fragment that can not be cut . similarly a bp fragment was amplified using the forward primer gaggaattggcgattaaagt and reverse primer ctgaagattatcaggagagcctc for analyzing the _PROTEIN_ mutant . an mboi restriction site is present in the wild type fragment that can be cut into and bp fragments while this restriction site was abolished by the _PROTEIN_ mutation . the two alleles were back crossed three times to remove the _LOCATION_ allele that was present in the parental background and additional mutations induced by ethyl methanesulfonate . the cdnas encoding the full length _PROTEIN_ and three _PROTEIN_ fragments were amplified by pcr with the following primers the forward primer ggaattctatggcttcgcttgtgtattctc and reverse primer acgcgtcgacttatcgatcgatcccttcgatcttg for full length _PROTEIN_ the forward primer ggaattctatggcttcgcttgtgtattctc and reverse primer acgcgtcgacttaatcaagattacattgcttagc for the forward primer ggaattctcccatgaggctgcttttctcc and reverse primer acgcgtcgacttatcgatcgatcccttcgatcttg for and the forward primer ggaattctcccatgaggctgcttttctcc and reverse primer acgcgtcgacttatgttgtgggaatagcctgagg for . the forward primers introduced an ecori restriction site and the reverse primers introduced a sali restriction site into the fragments . the pcr products were then digested and cloned directly into between the ecori and sali sites . the fragments in the plasmids were sequenced to check for _LOCATION_ . the recombinant _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ fragments were _PROTEIN_ in e. coli rosetta strains as a _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ fusion protein . the e. coli strains containing the _PROTEIN_ plasmids were grown at in l of luria bertani medium containing kanamycin until the optical density at nm of the cultures was to . protein _PROTEIN_ was induced by the addition of isopropyl d thiogalactopyranoside to a final concentration of mm at and rpm . after h the cells were lysed and proteins were purified on a chelating column as described in the pet system manual . a standard immunization protocol was used to immunize female rabbits . the e. coli _PROTEIN_ purified full length _PROTEIN_ fusion protein was injected five times at intervals of weeks . the antiserum was affinity purified . the immunoblotting of the _PROTEIN_ and truncated _PROTEIN_ proteins with the anti _PROTEIN_ serum was done essentially according to previously described procedures . proteins were separated by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ on polyacrylamide gels and the polypeptides were transferred to nitrocellulose _LOCATION_ in a medium consisting of mm tris hcl mm gly and methanol . after rinsing in tris buffered saline containing mm tris hcl and mm nacl the blotted _LOCATION_ were preincubated for h in a blocking buffer containing bovine serum albumin dissolved in tbs supplemented by tween and then incubated with gentle shaking for h at room temperature in appropriate antibodies . following extensive washes by the _LOCATION_ were incubated with goat anti rabbit igg conjugated with alkaline phosphatase at room temperature for h and then washed with and tbs . the locations of antigenic proteins were visualized by incubating the _LOCATION_ with nitroblue tetrazolium and bromo chloro indolyl phosphate . to test the specificity of the purified anti _PROTEIN_ serum we preincubated the antiserum with purified _PROTEIN_ fusion protein at for min before use to incubate the protein sample as described and as a control bovine serum albumin was used in the same preincubation instead of the _PROTEIN_ protein . this preincubation of the purified anti _PROTEIN_ serum with the antigen _PROTEIN_ protein completely abolished the ability of the antiserum to recognize either e. coli _PROTEIN_ purified _PROTEIN_ protein or natural _PROTEIN_ protein from arabidopsis total protein but the preincubation of the antiserum with bovine serum albumin did not affect this antiserum antigen recognition . this test showed that the anti _PROTEIN_ serum is specific to _PROTEIN_ protein . the leaves of arabidopsis were harvested from week old plants and ground in liquid nitrogen . the sample was then transferred into an eppendorf tube containing ice cold extraction buffer consisting of for aba affinity chromatography mm tris hcl ph mm nacl mm edta triton x glycerol mm dithiothreitol mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride leupeptin pepstatin a and aprotinin . the buffer for immunoblotting was composed of mm tris hcl ph mm nacl mm edta triton x glycerol and protease inhibitor cocktail . the sample was extracted for h in ice . the extracts were centrifuged for min at the supernatant was transferred to a new eppendorf tube and centrifuged again at for min and then the concentration of the supernatant was detected by _METHOD_ brilliant blue g . the samples were either kept at for immediate use or frozen and stored at until use . aba was linked to eah sepharose via _PROTEIN_ of the aba molecule according to previously described procedures . aba dissolved in ml of dimethylformamide solution was mixed with ml of drained eah sepharose . ethyle _PROTEIN_ hydrochloride was added into the aba eah sepharose solution the ph of which was adjusted to with n naoh . the aba eah sepharose solution was shaken for h at in the dark . the gel was then washed with dimethylformamide and then with both washing buffer i consisting of m nacl and m tris hcl and washing buffer ii composed of m nacl and m sodium acetate acetic acid . the gel was washed again with double distilled water . the coupling amount of aba to eah sepharose is determined essentially according to citation . aba eah sepharose was dissolved in glycerol and then the uv of the solution was measured with a uv photometer using glycerol as the control . the amount of the coupled aba was calculated according to the standard uv absorbance per millimolar aba at nm . the tested coupling efficiency which was the ratio of the coupling amount of aba to the total amount of the amino groups conjugated to the gel was approximately to . all of the procedures described below were done at . the aba linked eah sepharose gel was first equilibrated with buffer a solution consisting of mm mes naoh mm nacl mm mm and mm kcl . the equilibrated aba linked sepharose was then incubated with ml of pure e. coli _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ protein or ml of arabidopsis total protein for min in ml of buffer a . the final volume was ml . for the competition assays of _PROTEIN_ binding to the aba affinity column aba at or nm concentration was added into buffer a for this incubation of the aba linked sepharose gel with _PROTEIN_ protein . the same amount of ethanol for solubilizing or nm aba was used instead of aba as a control . the aba linked sepharose gel mixed with _PROTEIN_ protein was then packed into a column of cm for affinity chromatography . the column was first eluted with mm nacl in buffer a to remove the unspecific bound proteins . aba binding proteins were then eluted with the same buffer a containing or mm nacl and mm aba . the eluting solutions were assayed for immunoblotting with the anti _PROTEIN_ serum . labeled aba binding was performed essentially as described previously with modifications . we replaced the dextran coated charcoal with a glass fiber filter to remove free aba from the binding medium . we previously used the aba binding technique with a filter and this technique was recently used to assay the aba receptors _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . aba was made by american radiolabeled chemicals . the binding medium was composed of mm mes naoh mm mm mm dithiothreitol mm mannitol and protease inhibitor cocktail . each binding assay contained or nm aba with or without a fold molar excess of unlabeled aba of purified e. coli _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and binding buffer in a total volume . the mixtures were incubated at for min . the bound and free aba were separated as mentioned above by filtering the mixture through a gf/f glass fiber filter and washing with ml of ice cold aba binding buffer . the aba bound to _PROTEIN_ protein retained by the filter was then quantified by scintillation counting . the specific binding was determined by subtracting the binding in the presence of a fold molar excess of unlabeled aba from total binding . it is noteworthy that the radioactivity retained by the glass fiber filter _PROTEIN_ should be subtracted from the total and unspecific binding . the unspecific binding in all of the assays was less than of the total binding . the aba binding activity was _PROTEIN_ as moles of aba per mole of protein . for observation of the subcellular localization of the truncated _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ the corresponding cdna fragments driven by the cauliflower mosaic virus promoter and downstream tagged by _METHOD_ were obtained by enzymatic degradation from the above mentioned binary vector which was created for generating transgenic plants and harbors these cdna fragments linked to the promoter in the end and a c terminal _METHOD_ flag in the end . each of the promoter driven and _METHOD_ tagged cdna fragments was fused to the pmd t vector with the sphi and ecori sites . protoplasts were isolated from the leaves of to week old plants of arabidopsis and transiently transformed using polyethylene glycol essentially according to an established protocol . _METHOD_ of _METHOD_ was observed with a confocal laser scanning microscope after incubation at for h. phenotypic analysis was done essentially as described previously . for the germination assay approximately seeds each from the wild type mutants or transgenic mutants were sterilized and planted in triplicate on _METHOD_ medium _METHOD_ . the medium contained suc and agar and was supplemented with or without different concentrations of aba . the seeds were incubated at for d before being placed at under light conditions and germination was scored at the indicated times . for the seedling growth experiment seeds were germinated after stratification on common _METHOD_ medium and transferred to _METHOD_ medium supplemented with different concentrations of aba in the vertical position . the time for transfer was about to h after stratification for the transgenic plants and to h for the assays of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and cch mutants . this narrow aba responsive window of around h in seedling growth was observed for all of the _PROTEIN_ related mutants which may be partly associated with _PROTEIN_ regulation . seedling growth was investigated at the indicated times after the transfer and the lengths of primary roots were measured using a ruler . seedling growth was also assessed by directly planting the seeds in aba containing _METHOD_ medium to investigate the response of seedling growth to aba after germination . for stomatal aperture assays week old leaves were used . to observe aba induced stomatal closure leaves were floated in the buffer containing mm kcl and mm mes tris under a halogen cold light source at for h followed by the addition of different concentrations of aba . apertures were recorded on epidermal strips after h of further incubation to estimate aba induced closure . to study aba inhibited stomatal opening leaves were floated on the same buffer in the dark for h before they were transferred to the cold light for h in the presence of aba and then apertures were determined . the contents of chlorophyll protoix and mg protoix were assayed essentially according to previously described procedures . the following materials are available in the online version of this article . supplemental figure . transformation of wild type and cch mutant plants with empty vector _METHOD_ did not alter aba sensitivity in seed germination seedling growth and stomatal aperture . supplemental figure . affinity chromatography shows that both barley xanf and rice _PROTEIN_ bind aba . supplemental
