organ initiation requires the specification of a group of founder cells at the flanks of the shoot apical meristem and the creation of a functional boundary that separates the incipient primordia from the remainder of the meristem . organ development is closely linked to the downregulation of class i _PROTEIN_ like homeobox _PROTEIN_ genes and accumulation of auxin at sites of primordia initiation . here we show that arabidopsis thaliana _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ organs _PROTEIN_ a member of the _PROTEIN_ organ _PROTEIN_ domain gene family is required for coordinated organ development in shoot and floral _METHOD_ . loss of _PROTEIN_ function results in ectopic _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ genes shoot meristemless and brevipedicellus _PROTEIN_ indicating that _PROTEIN_ acts to restrict _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ acts in a trimeric protein complex with asymmetric _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ another lbd protein and _PROTEIN_ to suppress _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ organs . in addition to its role in _PROTEIN_ regulation we identified a role for _PROTEIN_ in regulating _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and auxin transport from embryogenesis onwards together with _PROTEIN_ . we propose that different _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ protein complexes possibly also comprising other lbd proteins coordinate auxin distribution and meristem function through the regulation of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ during arabidopsis development .
the embryonic or early seedling lethality of jlo and jlo mutants interfered with any functional analysis during _PROTEIN_ stages of development . thus most of our conclusions _PROTEIN_ the function of _PROTEIN_ in the shoot were drawn from misexpression experiments . we now characterized a series of novel jlo alleles that revealed phenotypically milder defects and allowed the dissection of _PROTEIN_ functions during _PROTEIN_ development . rt pcr analyses of rna isolated from seedlings showed that insertions located to the _PROTEIN_ transcriptional start cause a reduction in rna levels which are more severe in the jlo allele . homozygous jlo to jlo mutants produced shortened transcripts that were truncated to the insertions . sequencing of theses transcripts confirmed that the jlo to jlo alleles encode proteins that lack parts of the conserved _PROTEIN_ domain . allelism tests were subsequently performed . as expected for allelic mutations transheterozygosis of jlo with jlo to jlo failed to complement the embryo mutant phenotypes and seedling lethality of homozygous jlo mutants . we conclude that the phenotypic defects observed in the different jlo alleles solely are due to reduced or missing _PROTEIN_ function and not to previously unnoticed mutations in other genes . plants homozygous for the jlo mutation showed phenotypic alterations from early stages of seedling development onwards . similar to the previously described jlo allele jlo seedlings were smaller than wild type seedlings with a disorganized root and narrow cotyledons . however although growth and leaf development was strongly impaired homozygous jlo mutants were eventually able to bolt . jlo seedlings generated curled and fused leaves . the other jlo mutants studied here displayed normal vegetative development . after the transition to flowering all novel jlo alleles displayed related defects that were categorized into three classes . class i includes floral meristem identity defects _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . some of these flowers were subtended by cauline leaves further supporting this assumption . this phenotype appeared with a low frequency and _PROTEIN_ within the first four flowers of jlo and jlo mutants . class ii comprises homeotic transformations of _PROTEIN_ and stamen which appeared mostly on the first flowers of jlo mutants . however the majority of mutant flowers exhibited a reduced number and size of sepals _PROTEIN_ and stamens or displayed organ fusions . together these phenotypes were classified as class iii . jlo loss of function mutants arrest during embryogenesis or early seedling stages whereas reduced _PROTEIN_ activity causes leaf and floral defects . in addition we previously found altered target gene _PROTEIN_ in heterozygous jlo plants suggesting that plant development may be sensitive to the level of _PROTEIN_ activity . we therefore compared shoot development of wild type jlo and jlo plants to test this notion . heterozygous jlo mutants appeared aphenotypic during vegetative development . however after floral transition jlo flowers displayed defects that were comparable to those of jlo to jlo mutants namely homeotic transformations of second and third whorl organs reduction in floral organ number and organ fusions . floral buds opened prematurely due to smaller sepals and _PROTEIN_ and stamen size was notably reduced . jlo homozygous mutants show a severe retardation in shoot growth . scanning electron micrographs revealed that mutant _METHOD_ initiated primordia at arbitrary positions indicating _PROTEIN_ defects . most of these organs failed to grow out and the remaining primordia gave rise to radialized organs . by d after germination the shoot meristem had stopped further growth . notably this phenotype resembles that caused by inducible misexpression of a dominant negative version of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . thus both jlo and jlo plants exhibit defects in organ development albeit with different severity . meristem development requires _PROTEIN_ of class i _PROTEIN_ genes such as _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ and their downregulation in _PROTEIN_ organs . the arrest of meristem activity in the jlo mutants could be caused by changes in the activity or _PROTEIN_ levels of these genes . thus we examined _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in homozygous jlo loss of function mutants . in the wild type both _PROTEIN_ gus _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ gus were _PROTEIN_ only in meristematic tissue and downregulated in organ primordia at dag . by contrast _PROTEIN_ gus and _PROTEIN_ gus signal intensity increased in jlo _METHOD_ and expanded to the basis of _PROTEIN_ organ primordia . at dag _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were _PROTEIN_ throughout the enlarging apex and at the basis of organ primordia . using quantitative rt pcr assays we found that transcript levels of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are at least twofold increased in jlo mutant seedlings . furthermore we observed an upregulation of both genes in jlo and in jlo to jlo mutant seedlings . to further test whether _PROTEIN_ regulates organ development via repression of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ we generated the double mutants jlo bp and jlo stm . as previously published bp mutants appear aphenotypic during vegetative development but produce shorter internodes and pedicels together with downward pointing siliques after floral induction . in stm single mutants a shoot meristem is initiated but arrested after generating a few leaves . when we combined jlo with bp or stm primary leaves were visible at dag in jlo bp and jlo stm seedlings before leaf development and meristem activity was eventually arrested at dag . by contrast jlo single mutants initiated only radialized organs revealing that the reduction in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ function in jlo bp and jlo stm double mutants can partially rescue the leaf growth defects of jlo . plants defective in _PROTEIN_ function grow lobed leaves that accumulate _PROTEIN_ transcripts . furthermore mutants develop flowers that open prematurely due to reduced _PROTEIN_ and sepal sizes . thus jlo and mutants share several characteristics . because _PROTEIN_ of both genes overlaps in newly initiated organ primordia we hypothesized that they might act in a common pathway to direct organ development and regulate _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . we generated jlo and jlo double mutants to analyze their genetic interactions . both double mutant combinations displayed similar genetic interactions and only the jlo double mutants will be further discussed . compared with the wild type jlo embryogenesis is strongly impaired with aberrant patterning from the first cell division of the proembryo onwards and an overall delay in development whereas single mutants are aphenotypic during embryo development . jlo mutant embryos were indistinguishable from jlo mutant embryos and the strong jlo seedling phenotype was unaltered in jlo double mutants . to analyze a genetic interaction during _PROTEIN_ stages of development we also combined the and the mutation with the weaker jlo jlo and jlo alleles . again the combination of jlo jlo and jlo with either or caused similar phenotypes and only the jlo double mutants will be further described . compared with either single mutant we observed increased leaf lobing and ectopic leaflet formation in all double mutant combinations indicating enhanced _PROTEIN_ misexpression . using qrt pcr analysis we found a moderate increase of _PROTEIN_ but not of _PROTEIN_ transcript levels in jlo jlo and jlo mutant leaves . as we did not observe altered leaf morphology in the jlo jlo or jlo single mutants the level of ectopic _PROTEIN_ activity might be too low to affect leaf development . the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ was higher in mutant leaves and substantially higher in leaves of each jlo double mutant combination . notably the ectopic _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in all jlo mutant leaves was not accompanied by any reduction in _PROTEIN_ transcripts . these results suggest that both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are involved in the repression of _PROTEIN_ during leaf morphogenesis . we further analyzed flowers of jlo double mutants . with respect to either single mutant jlo sepals _PROTEIN_ and stamens were reduced in size and cell length was _PROTEIN_ . taken together these genetic data indicate that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ can function partially independently to direct leaf and flower development . the _PROTEIN_ that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ gene _PROTEIN_ is upregulated in jlo mutant seedlings suggested that _PROTEIN_ normally acts to downregulate these two homeobox genes . however this is in contrast with our previous observation that inducible misexpression of a fusion between _PROTEIN_ and the hormone binding domain of the _PROTEIN_ receptor _PROTEIN_ causes a drastic upregulation of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . to exclude that fusion to the _PROTEIN_ domain interferes with the normal _PROTEIN_ repressing function of _PROTEIN_ we designed an estradiol inducible _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ transgene . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ misexpressing plants revealed strongly lobed leaves resembling the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ misexpression phenotype and showed enhanced transcript levels of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ upon _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ induction . within h after induction both _PROTEIN_ protein and rna were strongly upregulated . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ levels significantly increased within hai suggesting an indirect mechanism of upregulation . we therefore speculated that the transgenic high level _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ might interfere with the regulatory pathways that normally restrict _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . in line with this we found that _PROTEIN_ requires _PROTEIN_ for this activity because induction of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in mutants did not alter the typical leaf phenotype in of all plants analyzed . moreover _PROTEIN_ levels of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ remained unaffected by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in an mutant background . from these data we conclude that _PROTEIN_ regulates _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ together with _PROTEIN_ . ectopic _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ could then either inhibit _PROTEIN_ transcription or interfere with _PROTEIN_ dependent regulation at the protein level . because qrt pcr analysis showed that _PROTEIN_ transcript levels are not altered in jlo mutants or upon _PROTEIN_ misexpression we tested the possibility that both proteins physically interact . we performed based yeast two hybrid experiments to assay a potential interaction between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ was fused to the activation domain and used as bait . since full length _PROTEIN_ was unstable and the _PROTEIN_ c terminus was activating transcription by itself we used only the n terminal _PROTEIN_ domain fused to the dna binding domain as prey . in this assay _PROTEIN_ was able to interact with the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ domain as demonstrated by growth on selective medium lacking leu trp his and ade . to map the domains relevant for the interaction we tested several truncations of both proteins . interaction was observed when _PROTEIN_ was combined with _PROTEIN_ versions carrying the gas block and coiled coil domain which are highly conserved amino acid regions within the _PROTEIN_ domain . none of the _PROTEIN_ truncations including only parts or the complete _PROTEIN_ domain were able to interact with _PROTEIN_ . this suggests that domains within the _PROTEIN_ c terminal region mediate the interaction . however the _PROTEIN_ c terminus fused to the ad appeared to be toxic for yeast . thus we performed yeast two hybrid experiments with _PROTEIN_ bd fusions as prey . interaction with _PROTEIN_ was obtained with full length _PROTEIN_ or only the c terminal domain of _PROTEIN_ . in yeast both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ can also interact with _PROTEIN_ an lbd protein closely related to _PROTEIN_ opening up the possibility that lbd proteins can form higher order complexes and act in a combinatorial fashion . however the interactions are not random between lbd proteins as for instance _PROTEIN_ was not able to bind _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ in yeast assays . complex formation between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ was shown to be required for _PROTEIN_ repression in _PROTEIN_ organs . coexpression of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ allowed yeast growth on selective media thus verifying the previously published data . however we did not observe any direct interaction between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . we therefore performed a yeast three hybrid assay to test whether _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ have the potential to form a multimeric complex . yeast was able to grow on selective medium when all three proteins were _PROTEIN_ showing that _PROTEIN_ can interact indirectly with _PROTEIN_ through _PROTEIN_ . the observation of such higher order complexes between _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ could help explain the effects of _PROTEIN_ misexpression on _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . here high level _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in a wild type background may interfere with the _PROTEIN_ restricting activity of the _PROTEIN_ complex possibly by sequestering _PROTEIN_ into _PROTEIN_ or multimeric complexes . to analyze protein interaction in planta _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were fused to the _METHOD_ proteins _METHOD_ _METHOD_ or mcherry and transiently _PROTEIN_ in nicotiana benthamiana leaf epidermal cells . we used a estradiol _PROTEIN_ system to limit overexpression artifacts and unspecific interactions . integrity of the different fusion proteins was confirmed by immunoblotting using an anti _METHOD_ antibody . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ fusion proteins were found in the cytoplasm and enriched in the nucleoplasm . _PROTEIN_ was localized to the _LOCATION_ with higher protein abundance in the nucleolus . consistent with previously published results the presence of _PROTEIN_ caused relocalization of _PROTEIN_ to the nucleoplasm . by contrast _PROTEIN_ did not affect _PROTEIN_ localization supporting the notion that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ do not directly interact . we used inducible misexpression in stably transformed arabidopsis plants to test the fusion proteins for functionality . in all cases we obtained the previously described gain of function phenotypes indicating that the fusion proteins are fully active . the observed subcellular localizations in arabidopsis root epidermal cells resembled those in n. benthamiana leaf epidermal cells . similarly coexpression of _PROTEIN_ but not of _PROTEIN_ resulted in a relocalization of _PROTEIN_ to the nucleoplasm . these findings are again consistent with a direct interaction of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and no direct binding of _PROTEIN_ to _PROTEIN_ . next we measured _METHOD_ resonance energy transfer efficiencies _PROTEIN_ between the _METHOD_ and mcherry pairs in planta . _PROTEIN_ was calculated as the percentage increase of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ after photobleaching of mcherry . all photobleaching experiments and _PROTEIN_ measurements were performed in the _LOCATION_ . in n. benthamiana leaf epidermal cells _METHOD_ signals were first detectable at hai and remained stable over h . upon extended induction some cells carried _METHOD_ aggregates indicating protein overexpression . therefore all measurements were performed within hai . as _PROTEIN_ depends on the orientation and distance of both chromophores to each other we measured intramolecular _PROTEIN_ as a control for the minimal distance . to this end both _METHOD_ and mcherry were fused together to the c termini of all tested proteins . the intramolecular _PROTEIN_ we measured for all fusion proteins ranged from to . calculation of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ fluctuation during photobleaching in the absence of the donor revealed a maximal background of in all control experiments . thus only _PROTEIN_ significantly higher than was _PROTEIN_ as an indication of close proximity or physical interaction of the two proteins for this set of experiments . the results we obtained confirmed our yeast interaction studies and showed a clear _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ interaction in both reciprocal _METHOD_ combinations . by contrast we did not observe a significant _PROTEIN_ for _PROTEIN_ . however when we coexpressed untagged _PROTEIN_ significant _PROTEIN_ between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ was recorded . measurements performed at and hai revealed that _PROTEIN_ remained stable over time indicating that _PROTEIN_ as a measure of protein interaction did not depend on protein overexpression . interestingly _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ showed significant homomerization suggesting that various homomers and heteromers may coexist within the _LOCATION_ . _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ proteins were used to further test the specificity of the observed interactions . both proteins localized to the _LOCATION_ and cytoplasm thus resembling subcellular localizations of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . in line with our yeast studies we detected an interaction between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ whereas _PROTEIN_ values for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were close to background . overall we noted a reduction of _PROTEIN_ in root epidermal cells of stably transformed arabidopsis plants compared with n. benthamiana . the intramolecular _PROTEIN_ we measured ranged only from to with a _METHOD_ background fluctuation of . we verified heteromerization of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ as well as homomerization of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ values for _PROTEIN_ were in the range of background level . we conclude that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ specifically interact in yeast n. benthamiana and arabidopsis . our studies revealed the capacity of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ to form protein complexes in arabidopsis and that both proteins can act together in the regulation of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in the shoot . _PROTEIN_ was previously shown to regulate auxin transport and signaling from embryogenesis onwards and we therefore asked if _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ share functions during early stages of development . _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ was analyzed using an _PROTEIN_ gus reporter gene construct . gus signals appeared on the adaxial side of cotyledons and organ primordia during embryonic and postembryonic development . in addition _PROTEIN_ gus was _PROTEIN_ in cells of the suspensor and the embryonic root tip . after germination _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ in the tips of seedling roots . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in embryos was analyzed through whole mount rna in situ hybridization . at the early heart stage _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ in the entire embryo with a stronger transcript accumulation in the basal domain . _PROTEIN_ on _PROTEIN_ is confined to the embryo axis the developing vasculature and the root pole . thus the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ domains overlap at the heart stage and in the basal root tip of _PROTEIN_ embryo stages . the _PROTEIN_ pattern of _PROTEIN_ during postembryonic development was analyzed using a _PROTEIN_ gus reporter construct . in the shoot _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ in the vasculature of cotyledons and leaves and weaker signals were also detected in the leaf blade . in seedling roots _PROTEIN_ gus is strongly _PROTEIN_ in the stele and in the root tip including the columella cells thus overlapping extensively with the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in these tissues . notably the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ levels are unaltered in mutants . similarly neither _PROTEIN_ domain nor _PROTEIN_ levels of _PROTEIN_ are altered in the jlo mutant background . the severe patterning defects of jlo embryos and roots result from a failure in auxin signaling and transport . thus we examined auxin distribution in mutants using the synthetic auxin response reporter _METHOD_ . in wild type heart stage embryos auxin accumulates at the root pole with an intensity maximum in the uppermost suspensor cell . unlike jlo mutants embryos displayed an unaltered _METHOD_ activity . postembryonic roots exhibit a maximum of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in the quiescent center the adjacent stem cells and columella cells . again activity was unaltered in seedling roots of mutants . because auxin accumulation is regulated by several _PROTEIN_ proteins we analyzed their _PROTEIN_ in more detail . we previously identified _PROTEIN_ as an important regulator of these efflux carriers . consistent with this _PROTEIN_ levels of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were reduced in the novel jlo to jlo alleles . we also analyzed the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ reporters in the mutant background . we found a _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signal in embryos and roots . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in roots was also reduced whereas _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signals were strongly increased . thus _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are similarly required for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ but they differ in their capacity to regulate _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . we sought to analyze whether _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ function together in the transcriptional regulation of _PROTEIN_ and . to this end we first performed qrt pcr analysis on jlo and single and double mutant roots . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ transcript levels are reduced in jlo mutants and we found a similar downregulation of these genes in the mutant background . jlo double mutants revealed no further _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ transcription suggesting that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ act together to promote _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . however _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was reduced in jlo mutants but nearly threefold upregulated in mutants . in jlo double mutants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ levels resembled those of jlo single mutants . this indicates that _PROTEIN_ is essential for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and that _PROTEIN_ heteromers may act to restrict _PROTEIN_ levels . _PROTEIN_ transcription is notably reduced in both jlo and mutant roots but further _PROTEIN_ in the double mutant indicating that _PROTEIN_ acts partially independently of _PROTEIN_ to promote _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . to further identify _PROTEIN_ dependent functions of _PROTEIN_ we analyzed the _PROTEIN_ of the _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ reporter in roots upon _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ induction . increased _PROTEIN_ activity was able to upregulate _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ but not _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in wild type roots while _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signals _PROTEIN_ within hai of _PROTEIN_ . in the mutant background _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ did not respond to _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ induction suggesting that _PROTEIN_ requires _PROTEIN_ for this function . _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ which is already increased in mutant roots compared with the wild type remained unaltered upon _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ induction . similarly _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signals did not respond to increased _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . using qrt pcr assays we confirmed that increased _PROTEIN_ activity is sufficient for _PROTEIN_ as well as _PROTEIN_ but not for _PROTEIN_ upregulation in wild type roots . _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ was first insensitive to _PROTEIN_ induction and _PROTEIN_ after prolonged _PROTEIN_ induction . in mutants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ transcript levels did not respond to _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ induction while _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ caused a minor increase in _PROTEIN_ rna levels . thus both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are required for positive regulation of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ also contributes to complexes that promote _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ which may compete with _PROTEIN_ in the regulation of _PROTEIN_ . this would imply that correct _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ requires a precise balance of various complexes that involve _PROTEIN_ . interference via _PROTEIN_ misexpression may increase _PROTEIN_ dimerization thus repressing _PROTEIN_ while the absence of _PROTEIN_ in mutants would preferentially allow the formation of _PROTEIN_ promoting complexes .
