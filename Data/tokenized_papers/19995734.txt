the actin _LOCATION_ plays a role in mobility of many different organelles in plant cells including chloroplasts mitochondria _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ . while progress has been made in identifying the myosin motors involved in trafficking of various plant organelles not all of the cargoes mobilized by different members of the myosin xi family have yet been identified . the involvement of myosins in chloroplast positioning and mitochondrial movement was demonstrated by _PROTEIN_ of a virus induced gene silencing construct in tobacco . when vigs with two different conserved sequences from a myosin xi motor was performed in plants with either _METHOD_ labeled _LOCATION_ or mitochondria chloroplast positioning in the dark was abnormal and mitochondrial movement ceased . because these and prior observations have implicated a role for myosins and the actin _LOCATION_ in _LOCATION_ and stromule movement we searched for myosin tail domains that could associate with _LOCATION_ and stromules . while a yellow _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ fusion with the entire tail region of myosin xi f was usually found only in the cytoplasm we observed that an arabidopsis or nicotiana benthamiana _METHOD_ myosin xi f tail domain homologous to the yeast _LOCATION_ binding domain associated with _LOCATION_ and stromules after transient _PROTEIN_ in n. benthamiana . taken together these observations implicate myosin motor proteins in dynamics of _LOCATION_ and stromules .
to assess the involvement of myosin xi motors in chloroplast localization we performed virus induced gene silencing of myosin genes by incorporating a highly conserved region from the motor domain of arabidopsis xi k. the sequence was selected as one that would be predicted to silence all arabidopsis myosin xis based on high levels of sequence identity with the remaining myosin xis . sequence analysis also predicted that the myosin xi silencing sequences was sufficiently dissimilar to arabidopsis myosin viii that silencing of the four arabidopsis myosin viiis would be unlikely . because the n. tabacum complete genome sequence is not available the sequences were chosen so that they would be likely to affect tobacco myosin xis rather than tobacco myosin viii according to alignments of the chosen silencing sequences against the two known myosin viii motor domain sequences available from n. benthamiana . following incorporation of the sequences into a tobacco rattle virus vector tobacco plants carrying either _METHOD_ labeled chloroplasts or _METHOD_ labeled mitochondria were agroinfiltrated . initial control experiments with the vigs vector carrying phytoene desaturase _PROTEIN_ sequence revealed that silencing was efficient with this vector under our inoculation and growth conditions . _PROTEIN_ silencing impairs carotenoid synthesis and the characteristic bleached leaves resulting from light sensitivity were observed in almost every plant inoculated . the same agroinfiltration was followed to inoculate plants with the myosin silencing vector . after several weeks of growth leaves were removed following incubation of the plants in dim light . in order to assess whether silencing occurred rna was isolated from control plants inoculated with the vector alone and from plants inoculated with the highly conserved myosin xi sequence . reverse transcription polymerase chain reactions were performed using primers that could amplify four different n. tabacum myosin xi genes and one myosin viii gene . after pcr cycles and agarose gel electrophoresis products were seen in all of the lanes from the control plants . fewer pcr products were seen in the lanes containing myosin xi rt pcrs in the inoculated plants indicating that the abundance of some myosin xi transcripts was reduced as a result of silencing . surprisingly the rt pcr experiments indicated that n. tabacum myosin viii transcripts are also reduced in the inoculated plants . these results indicate that silencing of some myosins did occur in the plants inoculated with the vigs vector containing the highly conserved myosin xi sequence . because there is no complete genome sequence for n. tabacum we can not determine whether _PROTEIN_ of all myosin xis is reduced and whether _PROTEIN_ of other myosin viiis is affected . mesophyll cells in control plants inoculated with the vector lacking a myosin sequence were compared to those inoculated with myosin silencing sequences . cells inoculated with the control vector exhibited the characteristic accumulation of chloroplasts in one plane while cells from the myosin sequence inoculated plants exhibited disorganized chloroplasts . these observations indicate that proper _PROTEIN_ of one or more myosins is required for correct positioning of chloroplasts in response to reduced light levels . because it is well established that plant mitochondria are mobilized by myosin xi motors and mitochondria exhibit rapid movement in wild type plants we also compared mobility of mitochondria in the control plants and plants inoculated with the myosin vigs vectors . mitochondria in mesophyll cells of control plants exhibited normal positioning and mobility while cells in the myosin vigs plants exhibited severely impaired mobility . in some cells inoculated with the myosin vigs vector the mitochondria appeared to be either mildly or extremely aggregated in contrast to the usual location of mitochondria dispersed throughout the cell . previously we examined the location of _METHOD_ fusions to various portions of the tail sequences of myosins _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ xi b xi i xi j xi k but did not observe any labeling of chloroplasts with _METHOD_ . when two portions of the tail regions of all arabidopsis myosins were fused to _METHOD_ proteins no interaction with chloroplasts was reported and five myosin tails gave only diffuse cytoplasmic signals . because we had earlier observed that sometimes smaller portions of myosin tails resulted in vesicle labeling while larger portions of the tail did not we surveyed a variety of _METHOD_ fusions to smaller portions of myosin xi tails by transient _PROTEIN_ in n. benthamiana . one such fusion with a small region of the tail region of arabidopsis myosin xi f was found to label chloroplasts and stromules . we investigated whether the homologous region from n. benthamiana myosin xi f would also result in specific labeling when fused to _METHOD_ . using the previously reported sequence of n. benthamiana myosin xi f a new _METHOD_ myosin xi f _PROTEIN_ vector carrying the homologous sub domain was constructed and agroinfiltrated into n. benthamiana leaves . we again observed specific localization to chloroplasts and stromules . in some epidermal cells we also observed _METHOD_ labeled vesicular structures . in order to investigate the identity of the vesicles labeled by the n. benthamiana _METHOD_ myosin xi f fusion the n. benthamiana myosin xi f vector was co infiltrated with mcherry markers for either _LOCATION_ mitochondria or perixosomes . we noticed that some cells exhibited _METHOD_ labeling of almost all mcherry labeled _LOCATION_ while a portion of the mcherry labeled _LOCATION_ vesicles in particular cells also exhibited _METHOD_ signals . we did not detect co localization of _METHOD_ myosin xi f with mitochondria . the labeling of _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ appeared to occur in epidermal cells while the labeling of _LOCATION_ most often occurred in cells with chlorophyll containing _LOCATION_ . possibly these differences in labeling could occur because of differential _PROTEIN_ of receptors or _PROTEIN_ proteins that interact with myosin xi f and the relevant cargo in different cell types . following agroinfiltration not all cells _PROTEIN_ the transgene encoded protein at the same levels also perhaps affecting the localization . when the myosin xi f tail or globular domain was overexpressed in n. benthamiana no disturbance of _LOCATION_ movement was detected in leaf epidermal cells though the myosin xi f tail does reduce _LOCATION_ movement when _PROTEIN_ in n. tabacum . reduced trafficking of _LOCATION_ in leaf epidermal cells was detected when the xi f tail was overexpressed in n. benthamiana consistent with our detection of interaction of the _METHOD_ myosin xi f sub domain with _LOCATION_ . did not observe any effect on mitochondrial trafficking when _METHOD_ fused to the xi f myosin tail was transiently _PROTEIN_ in n. benthamiana . the lack of effect on mitochondrial movement is consistent with our finding of no co localization of our _METHOD_ fusion with mitochondria marker . the _METHOD_ signal from the myosin xi f fusion appears to surround chloroplasts suggesting an association with the chloroplast envelope . the location of the _METHOD_ myosin xi f construct is similar to the _METHOD_ signal visualized in plants transformed with a _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion although the _METHOD_ signal from the myosin xi f fusion often does not surround the entire chloroplast . _PROTEIN_ is an outer envelope protein and the fusion was designed to avoid interference with incorporation of _PROTEIN_ into the chloroplast envelope . when transiently _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fused to the xi f myosin tail with iq repeats or to the remainder of the tail without the iq repeats only cytoplasmic localization of the _METHOD_ protein was detected in n. benthamiana . we made a _METHOD_ construct to the portion of the myosin xi f tail beginning with the coiled coil region and also observed only cytoplasmic _PROTEIN_ in contrast to the specific localization to the chloroplast surface and stromules obtained with the smaller xi f tail sub domain . the myosin xi f tail sub domain from arabidopsis and n. benthamiana that labeled chloroplasts in cells when fused c terminally to _METHOD_ is a amino acid polypeptide that is similar to the domain in yeast that is required for _LOCATION_ inheritance . in yeast a single myosin is responsible for transport of secretory vesicles _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and the _LOCATION_ . overexpression of the globular tail region of is lethal evidently a dominant negative effect on cargo trafficking . the yeast tail region contains two different domains one of which is required for interaction with _LOCATION_ and a second that is needed for association with secretory vesicles . proteins with altered amino acids in the _LOCATION_ sub domain retain interaction with secretory vesicles though _LOCATION_ inheritance is affected and mutations in the other sub domain affect vesicle trafficking without altering _LOCATION_ inheritance . the arabidopsis and n. benthamiana tail sub domain sequences are highly similar of the amino acids are identical . the homology of the plant sub domains to the yeast sub domain is also evident eight amino acids are identical between yeast and plant sequences and amino acids are either identical or represent conservative changes between yeast and plants . this sub domain may be hidden or folded improperly when _METHOD_ fusions are made to larger portions of the tail preventing its interaction with other proteins that mediate a specific interaction with the chloroplast envelope . this amino acid sub domain could be involved in the interaction of myosin xi f with _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ in certain cells and with chloroplasts in other types of cells . at present our data do not allow us to conclude whether or not other portions of the xi f tail as yet unidentified could interact with additional types of cargo . stromules are highly motile in epidermal and non green cells . stromules have been observed to be attached to unidentified cellular components and then detach sometimes to break off or to loop around and contact the outer surface of the _LOCATION_ . the labeling of stromules with the _METHOD_ myosin xi f sub domain fusion implicates myosin motors in both movement and possibly the anchoring of stromules to the _LOCATION_ . none of the mutant lines with insertions in all arabidopsis myosin xi genes was reported to exhibit any defects in chloroplast movement . this observation suggests that myosin xi f is not likely to be solely responsible for motility of chloroplasts . according to experiments with arabidopsis myosin mutants and nicotiana plants _PROTEIN_ rna silencing constructs considerable redundancy of function exists in the myosin xi gene family . insertional mutants in each of the arabidopsis myosin xi genes exhibited either no detectable phenotypes or minor abnormalities . loss of function mutants of arabidopsis myosin xi k and _PROTEIN_ resulted in abnormal root hair morphogenesis and the xi k mutants were also disturbed in trichome development . the mutations in these two genes reduced the rate but did not prevent the movement of mitochondria _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ bodies . if disruption of a single myosin gene could block all chloroplast movement arabidopsis plants would be expected to exhibit light sensitivity as was found for chloroplast relocation mutants . we therefore expect that there may be one or more additional myosin xis that also interact with chloroplasts and stromules and function in their mobility . additional analysis of myosins will be necessary to assign all members of the myosin xi family to their respective cargoes and functions .
