retrograde _LOCATION_ to _LOCATION_ signaling tightly controls and coordinates the _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ gene _PROTEIN_ that is required for _LOCATION_ biogenesis and chloroplast activity . as chloroplasts act as sensors of environmental changes _LOCATION_ derived signaling also modulates stress responses of plants by transferring stress related signals and altering _LOCATION_ gene _PROTEIN_ . various mutant screens have been undertaken to identify constituents of _LOCATION_ signaling pathways . almost all mutations identified in these screens target _LOCATION_ specific but not extraplastidic functions . they have been suggested to define either genuine constituents of retrograde signaling pathways or components required for the synthesis of _LOCATION_ signals . here we report the characterization of the constitutive activator of aaa _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutant which reveals another way of how mutations that affect _LOCATION_ functions may modulate retrograde _LOCATION_ signaling . _PROTEIN_ disturbs a _LOCATION_ specific function by impeding _LOCATION_ division and thereby perturbing _LOCATION_ homeostasis . this results in preconditioning plants by activating the _PROTEIN_ of stress genes enhancing pathogen resistance and attenuating the capacity of the plant to respond to _LOCATION_ signals . our study reveals an intimate link between chloroplast activity and the susceptibility of the plant to stress and emphasizes the need to consider the possible impact of preconditioning on retrograde _LOCATION_ to _LOCATION_ signaling .
the flu aaa luc _PROTEIN_ mutant was found in a screen for mutants that show constitutively high _PROTEIN_ of the responsive aaa _PROTEIN_ and a aaa _PROTEIN_ promoter luciferase reporter gene . the _PROTEIN_ mutant was backcrossed to the original flu aaa luc line . the segregation analysis of this cross verified that a single recessive mutation causes the caa phenotype . flu aaa luc _PROTEIN_ displayed a very high luciferase activity in day old seedlings as well as in day old rosette plants grown under continuous light . in day old seedlings the luciferase activity was predominantly confined to cotyledons . transcript levels of both the endogenous aaa _PROTEIN_ gene and the luciferase reporter gene were constitutively upregulated demonstrating that _PROTEIN_ acts in trans . seedlings of flu aaa luc _PROTEIN_ exhibited reduced size and a pale green leaf color . the growth defect of flu aaa luc _PROTEIN_ became even more obvious in older plants . the chlorophyll content of flu aaa luc _PROTEIN_ at different stages of seedling development was lower than in the wild type . it could not be restored to wild type level by growing seedlings on _METHOD_ media supplemented with sucrose or under low light . the screen for caa mutations in the flu parental line was based on the constitutive _PROTEIN_ of the responsive aaa _PROTEIN_ gene in the absence of enhanced production . following a shift from dark to light _PROTEIN_ of the endogenous aaa _PROTEIN_ and the aaa luc reporter gene in the flu mutant is strongly upregulated and the transcripts of these genes reach high levels that exceed those in the flu _PROTEIN_ mutant prior to re illumination . after shifting light grown flu _PROTEIN_ seedlings to the dark for h their pchlide reached a fivefold higher level than in wild type controls . during the re illumination the generation of in these mutant seedlings triggered a further strong upregulation of aaa _PROTEIN_ and aaa luc _PROTEIN_ . hence _PROTEIN_ does not perturb mediated signaling . this conclusion was confirmed by analyzing aaa _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ deficient seedlings . the _LOCATION_ proteins _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are required for the transfer of dependent signals from the _LOCATION_ to the _LOCATION_ and for the upregulation of responsive genes . if the constitutive upregulation of aaa _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ occurs via a different signaling pathway the inactivation of _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ should not interfere with the _PROTEIN_ of aaa _PROTEIN_ . the mutations were introduced into the flu _PROTEIN_ background by crossing flu with flu _PROTEIN_ . homozygous flu _PROTEIN_ quadruple mutants were selected from the segregating population of this cross . in double mutants normal _LOCATION_ differentiation during seedling development occurred only when immature seeds were allowed to develop in the dark . hence for the subsequent analysis of the quadruple mutant only seeds from siliques that had been kept in the dark were used . seedlings were grown for days under continuous light before the visible phenotype and transcript level of the aaa _PROTEIN_ gene were scored . seedlings of the flu mutant and flu were indistinguishable whereas flu _PROTEIN_ and flu _PROTEIN_ displayed a pale green phenotype . transcripts of aaa _PROTEIN_ reached between six and sevenfold higher levels in flu _PROTEIN_ and flu _PROTEIN_ than in flu and flu indicating that constitutive upregulation of aaa _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in flu _PROTEIN_ was retained in the absence of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . the major consequences of the generation of in the flu mutant after a shift from dark to light are rapid changes in _LOCATION_ gene _PROTEIN_ followed by growth inhibition and cell death . the constitutive activation of the responsive aaa _PROTEIN_ gene and growth inhibition of flu aaa luc _PROTEIN_ suggested that cell death might also be constitutively activated in the flu aaa luc _PROTEIN_ mutant . the onset of cell death was analyzed in seedlings grown under continuous light . in cotyledons of day old flu aaa luc _PROTEIN_ mutant seedlings only a few dead cells could be detected by trypan blue staining . in day old seedlings the number of dead cells in cotyledons strongly increased . in day old flu aaa luc _PROTEIN_ plants a similar pattern of dead cells could be seen in rosette leaves as in cotyledons of day old seedlings . the results of tb staining were confirmed by treating seedlings with propidium iodine _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ is excluded from intact cells but penetrates dying or dead cells and intercalates double stranded _LOCATION_ acids . similar results were obtained after flu aaa luc _PROTEIN_ was first backcrossed twice with col and homozygous _PROTEIN_ mutants lacking the flu mutation were analyzed . the induction of cell death may result from plants being exposed to excess excitation energy . however in _PROTEIN_ mutants the appearance of cell death and other stress responses such as the constitutive activation of the responsive aaa _PROTEIN_ gene and reduced growth already occur under moderate light conditions . to analyze the possible light intensity dependency of these stress responses seedlings were grown under continuous low light levels for days when seedlings reach a similar developmental stage as day old seedlings grown under . cell death was strongly suppressed in seedlings grown under low light levels which contained only a few randomly distributed dead cells . a comparable suppression of the growth inhibition phenotype was observed . similarly the aaa _PROTEIN_ gene but also other genes such as _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ to a much lower extent in _PROTEIN_ grown for days under low light levels . collectively these results suggest that the initiation of spontaneous cell death the constitutive activation of aaa _PROTEIN_ and the growth inhibition in _PROTEIN_ are light intensity dependent and increase with higher light intensities . the mutated gene causing the constitutive activation of the aaa luc reporter gene in the flu aaa luc _PROTEIN_ line was identified by map based cloning using sslp and caps polymorphic markers . the homozygous flu aaa luc _PROTEIN_ mutant was backcrossed with flu in the ler ecotype . from the mapping population of this cross homozygous flu aaa luc _PROTEIN_ seedlings were selected that showed strong luciferase activity co segregating with a reduced size and a pale green leaf color . a bulk segregant analysis was used to determine the approximate chromosomal position of the _PROTEIN_ mutation . pcr analysis of bulk dna originating from recombinant flu aaa luc _PROTEIN_ plants established a genetic linkage for the and polymorphic markers located on the lower arm of chromosome v . a total of aaa luc _PROTEIN_ plants of the segregating mapping population were analyzed for genetic linkage to polymorphic markers localized in the region between the and markers . _PROTEIN_ was localized in an kb region covered by two bac clones and which carry open reading frames . three of these genes were predicted to encode chloroplast proteins . as the pale green phenotype of flu aaa luc _PROTEIN_ linked to the constitutive luciferase activity is probably caused by an impairment of chloroplast activity genes predicted to encode chloroplast proteins were considered to be prime candidates for the _PROTEIN_ mutation . in one of these genes _GENE_ a single point mutation at position after the predicted start codon was detected that resulted in an amino acid exchange from gly to asp at position . _PROTEIN_ is located in the n terminal hydrophobic region of the predicted protein that constitutes a putative trans _LOCATION_ domain . previously a mutant with aberrant _GENE_ function had been identified during a t dna library screen for plants with an altered leaf lamina that was named crumpled leaf . hence _PROTEIN_ represents a second ethyl methanesulfonate _METHOD_ mutagenesis derived allele of crl named crl . to confirm that the mutation in the _PROTEIN_ gene was responsible for constitutive luciferase _PROTEIN_ and the morphological characteristics of _PROTEIN_ two approaches were used . first an allelism test was performed . crl and flu _PROTEIN_ were crossed and plants of this cross were analyzed . they closely resembled the parental flu _PROTEIN_ plants except that they were slightly paler . second a plasmid containing the coding region of _GENE_ under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus promoter _PROTEIN_ was introduced into flu _PROTEIN_ . complemented flu _PROTEIN_ plants were phenotypically indistinguishable from flu reverting the reduced size and pale phenotype of flu _PROTEIN_ . transcripts of the aaa _PROTEIN_ gene reached similar low levels in the complementing line and in flu very much in contrast to the transcript level of this gene in flu _PROTEIN_ . the complemented line also no longer showed a defect in chloroplast division as seen in flu _PROTEIN_ . tb staining of the complemented line demonstrated that spontaneous cell death in flu _PROTEIN_ was no longer detectable . hence constitutive aaa _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ stunted growth reduced chl content disturbed chloroplast division and spontaneous cell deaths in _PROTEIN_ are caused by the mutation of a single gene _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ protein _METHOD_ part of the outer envelope _LOCATION_ of _LOCATION_ . as shown previously mesophyll cells of the crl mutant contain only a few extremely enlarged chloroplasts . also in crl _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ division was severely impaired . mesophyll cells of crl contained a highly variable population of different sized _LOCATION_ ranging from cells with approximately enlarged _LOCATION_ to cells with a single extremely large chloroplast whereas in the wild type approximately chloroplasts per mesophyll cell are present . the wide range of different _LOCATION_ sizes in mesophyll cells of crl suggests that in crl _LOCATION_ were divided unevenly as has previously been reported for the crl mutant . the _LOCATION_ division defect in crl was also observed in other cell types like guard cells . the crl guard cells contained only one or two _LOCATION_ per cell or were completely devoid of _LOCATION_ . guard cells lacking _LOCATION_ were previously reported for other _LOCATION_ division mutants such as _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and have been described in detail in crl . to test its light dependency the _LOCATION_ division phenotype was also studied in etiolated seedlings . crl was crossed with a _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgenic line in a flu background . flu crl _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ plants were grown on _METHOD_ media in the dark for days and cotyledons were analyzed under a confocal microscope for _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and red _METHOD_ of free pchlide that overaccumulates in dark grown flu seedlings . as shown in figure mesophyll cells of dark grown flu crl _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ seedlings contain etioplasts that are significantly enlarged relative to the etioplasts of the parental flu _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ line . the loss of a functional _PROTEIN_ protein thus results in an impairment of _LOCATION_ division also in the absence of light . in the crl mutant a defect in _LOCATION_ division is linked to a change in the _PROTEIN_ of the responsive marker gene aaa _PROTEIN_ growth reduction and spontaneous cell death . this suggests that an impairment of _LOCATION_ division by other mutations also evokes a similar pleiotropic response as crl . to address this question known _LOCATION_ division mutants were analyzed that either contain similar numbers of enlarged chloroplasts in mesophyll cells such as crl or are affected in chloroplast envelope proteins with a similar localization pattern as the _PROTEIN_ protein . based on these criteria mutant lines _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were selected . seeds of t dna tagged lines were obtained for all mutants from the salk collection . homozygous t dna mutant lines were identified by genotyping and/or by microscopic identification of enlarged chloroplasts in mesophyll cells of young seedlings . similar patterns of enlarged chloroplasts were observed in mesophyll cells of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and crl . in each of these lines the initiation of cell death was analyzed by tb staining . positive tb staining was detected in the cotyledons of day old seedlings _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . in cotyledons of _PROTEIN_ only a few randomly distributed dead cells were observed . true leaves of all selected mutants displayed positive tb staining primarily in palisade parenchyma cells . such staining was not seen in the wild type . a similar result was obtained after staining dead cells with _PROTEIN_ . as in crl light intensity dependent cell death initiation was also observed in the cotyledons and true leaves of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ showing attenuated cell death under low light conditions . finally the _PROTEIN_ of ros marker genes was analyzed in cotyledons of chloroplast division defect mutants . similar to crl de repression of aaa _PROTEIN_ gene _PROTEIN_ also occurred in _PROTEIN_ and to a lesser extent _PROTEIN_ . another responsive gene _PROTEIN_ was even more de repressed in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ than in crl . the general oxidative stress marker gene _PROTEIN_ was constitutively activated in all mutant lines with transcript levels higher in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ than in crl whereas the marker gene _PROTEIN_ was hardly affected in any of the mutant lines . the impairment of _LOCATION_ division in crl and other _LOCATION_ division mutants activates a stress response that results in the upregulation of responsive and general oxidative stress marker genes and in the spontaneous microlesion formation in cotyledons and true leaves . the light intensity dependency of these stress responses may result from the reduced ability of _LOCATION_ division mutants to avoid potentially harmful higher light levels by moving chloroplasts to the cell periphery and orienting them in columns parallel to the plane of the incoming light . chloroplast movement is thought to alleviate photodamage of photosystem ii under high light conditions . enlarged chloroplasts have a reduced capacity to use light energy and to minimize photodamage under varying light conditions . to verify this possible cause of stress responses in _LOCATION_ division mutants the avoidance response mutants _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were grown under the same light conditions as crl . aaa _PROTEIN_ transcript levels in these mutants were compared with those in wild type control seedlings . in contrast to crl _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ seedlings did not upregulate aaa _PROTEIN_ relative to the wild type and they did not form microlesions . hence constitutive stress responses in crl do not seem to be primarily caused by the perturbed light avoidance response of chloroplasts . the crl mutation does not perturb the dependent signaling pathway . thus a mediated cell death response after a shift from dark to light may be expected not only in flu but also in flu crl seedlings . surprisingly the presence of the crl mutation in flu seedlings suppresses the onset of mediated cell death . previously other second site mutations have been identified in flu that like crl do not perturb mediated signaling but lead instead to a suppression of mediated cell death . suppression of mediated cell death in flu _PROTEIN_ flu and _PROTEIN_ flu has been attributed to a constitutive minor stress response that activates acclimation prior to the release of after a shift from dark to light . two criteria have been used to define such a change in stress susceptibility of the two soldat mutants and first the constitutive upregulation of stress responsive genes second an enhanced resistance against a combined low temperature/high light stress . crl seedlings also upregulate the _PROTEIN_ of stress responsive genes but they do not show an enhanced resistance against the combined low temperature/high light stress . if indeed constitutive activation of acclimation suppresses mediated cell death in crl an acclimatory response in crl must differ from that in the other second site mutants of flu . the cell death response pattern in crl seedlings recapitulates the microlesion formation in arabidopsis plants in response to pathogens . the possible constitutive activation of a pathogen defense response in crl was first tested by measuring the transcript levels of pathogen related protein _PROTEIN_ in day old seedlings of crl flu and wild type . an enhanced _PROTEIN_ of the pathogen defense marker gene _PROTEIN_ was confined to light grown crl seedlings and to flu seedlings exposed to a shift from dark to light . in wild type and flu seedlings grown under continuous light _PROTEIN_ transcripts were not detectable . to test the possible physiological impact of stress preacclimation in crl wild type and crl seedlings were spray inoculated with virulent pseudomonas syringae that constitutively _PROTEIN_ a luciferase reporter gene . bacterial growth was determined after different lengths of incubation by measuring the luciferase activity in extracts of inoculated plants . in crl the growth of the virulent pathogen was strongly suppressed compared with wild type seedlings .
