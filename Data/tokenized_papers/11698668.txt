all plants flower _PROTEIN_ in their life cycle . for example in arabidopsis the shoot undergoes a transition and produces reproductive flowers after the adult phase of vegetative growth . much is known about genetic and environmental processes that control flowering time in mature plants . however little is understood about the _METHOD_ that prevent plants from flowering much earlier during embryo and seedling development . arabidopsis embryonic flower _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutants flower soon after germination suggesting that a floral repression mechanism is established in wild type plants that prevents flowering until maturity . here we show that polycomb group proteins play a central role in repressing flowering early in the plant life cycle . we found that mutations in the fertilization independent endosperm _PROTEIN_ polycomb gene caused the seedling shoot to produce flower like structures and organs . flower like structures were also generated from the hypocotyl and root organs not associated with reproduction . _PROTEIN_ of floral induction and homeotic genes was derepressed in mutant embryos and seedlings . these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ mediated polycomb complexes are an essential component of a floral repression mechanism established early during plant development .
to understand _PROTEIN_ polycomb function and to visualize the pattern of recombinant _PROTEIN_ protein accumulation we generated arabidopsis lines bearing a transgene _METHOD_ with bp of _PROTEIN_ flanking sequences a modified _PROTEIN_ untranslated region a sequence that encodes the full length _PROTEIN_ protein _PROTEIN_ a linker sequence encoding six glycine amino acids and then a sequence encoding a green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ . _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was detected in the progenitor of the endosperm the central cell _LOCATION_ before and after fertilization . by the eight _LOCATION_ endosperm stage _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was no longer detectable and could not be detected at any _PROTEIN_ stage of plant development . nor could _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ rna be detected in _METHOD_ transgenic seedlings when the endogenous _PROTEIN_ gene is _PROTEIN_ . thus _PROTEIN_ of the _METHOD_ transgene in the very early stages of seed development observed in multiple independently transformed lines was highly restricted when compared with the pattern of _PROTEIN_ rna accumulation in the ovule female gametophyte embryo endosperm seedling leaf stem root and flower . although _METHOD_ transgene _PROTEIN_ did not recapitulate the wild type pattern of _PROTEIN_ rna accumulation perhaps because of a requirement for additional regulatory sequences and/or the sensitivity of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ detection it was able to complement the fie seed abortion phenotype . that is self pollinated heterozygous fie plants that are homozygous for the _METHOD_ transgene displayed siliques with no seed abortion . when germinated we observed seedlings all homozygous for the _METHOD_ transgene with mendelian segregation of _PROTEIN_ fie fie genotypes . in contrast siliques from control self pollinated fie plants contain nonviable seeds and when germinated the seedlings segregate for _PROTEIN_ fie genotypes . thus _PROTEIN_ of the _METHOD_ transgene in the central cell and early endosperm rescues embryo and seed abortion associated with inheritance of a maternal mutant fie allele . this result shows that the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein is active and suggests that fie embryo and seed abortion may be due primarily to a defect in endosperm development . plants homozygous for the _METHOD_ transgene that were either homozygous for the wild type _PROTEIN_ allele or heterozygous fie developed normally . thus in the presence of a wild type _PROTEIN_ allele the _METHOD_ transgene caused no detectable alteration in plant development . however none of the seedlings tested that were homozygous for the fie allele and the _METHOD_ transgene developed normally . these seedlings were smaller and did not produce normal rosettes . in some cases highly disorganized structures emerged from the shoot apical meristem . seedlings often produced sessile leaves with trichomes that resembled cauline leaves . we also observed white _PROTEIN_ like organs lacking trichomes . in some cases floral buds emerged that were surrounded by sessile leaves . within the floral buds outer whorl sepals could be distinguished by the appearance of unbranched trichomes on their abaxial surfaces and by their highly elongated cells . inner whorl organs whose distinctive shapes resembled immature stamens and carpels were also observed . finally floral organs within flower buds often displayed proper floral crucifer _PROTEIN_ . the mutant phenotypes described above were observed in multiple independently isolated transgenic lines as well as in seedlings homozygous for the null fie allele and for a _PROTEIN_ transgene that produces _PROTEIN_ protein without a _METHOD_ moiety . thus the mutant phenotypes were not due to any effect of _METHOD_ on the structure or cellular location of _PROTEIN_ . taken together these results show that the transition from vegetative to inflorescence development has prematurely occurred in the shoot apical meristem of seedlings homozygous for the null fie allele and the _METHOD_ transgene . this result suggests that one of the functions of the _PROTEIN_ gene is to repress the transition to flowering in the seedling shoot apical meristem . production of shoots and flower like organs was not limited to the shoot apical meristem in seedlings homozygous for the fie allele and the _METHOD_ transgene . shoots frequently emerged from the hypocotyl and roots of intact seedlings . carpel shaped organs with stigmatic papillae at their tips were present in such adventitious shoots . in addition organs tipped with stigmatic papillae and with structures resembling ovule primordia on their edges were observed . in some cases shoots with organs arranged in a floral crucifer _PROTEIN_ were observed . when roots were cultured in hormone free media many additional organs were produced with stigmatic papillae and structures resembling ovule primordia . these results show that ectopic shoots and organs resembling flowers were produced in seedlings homozygous for the fie allele and the _METHOD_ transgene . this result suggests that another function of the wild type _PROTEIN_ allele is to repress the formation of shoots and floral organs outside of the seedling shoot apical meristem region . the mutant phenotypes described above were observed in transgenic _METHOD_ seedlings that were also homozygous for the null fie allele and were never observed when a wild type _PROTEIN_ allele was present . thus the _METHOD_ transgenic allele is recessive to the wild type _PROTEIN_ allele . this _PROTEIN_ along with the restriction of _METHOD_ gene _PROTEIN_ to very early seed development suggests that loss of _PROTEIN_ activity is responsible for early flowering and ectopic shoot formation in seedlings that are homozygous for the null fie allele and have a _METHOD_ transgene . from this result we reasoned that expanding the period of _PROTEIN_ activity during embryogenesis and seedling development with a different transgene might result in plants that develop more normally . to test this hypothesis we generated _METHOD_ transgenic plants where transcription of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ is under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus promoter . in _METHOD_ lines we detected a broad pattern of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ throughout embryo development including the _PROTEIN_ stages that diminished in the germinating seedling . whereas _METHOD_ gene _PROTEIN_ was not detected in seedlings _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ rna encoded by the _METHOD_ gene was present . by genetic crosses we obtained plants that were homozygous for fie _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ . these plants did not display any of the mutant phenotypes shown in fig . fig ref and could not be distinguished from wild type plants . they produced rosette leaves followed by inflorescences fertile flowers and siliques with viable seed . thus we were able to adjust the level of _PROTEIN_ activity with the two transgenes to recapitulate the wild type flowering time phenotype . these results verify that early flowering and ectopic shoot and floral organ formation is due to a critical lack of _PROTEIN_ activity in seedlings homozygous for fie and the _METHOD_ transgene . to understand the molecular basis for the early flowering phenotypes we measured the _PROTEIN_ of meristem and floral organ identity genes in mutant and control seedlings . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ encode transcription _PROTEIN_ that promote floral meristem identity in arabidopsis and with the aid of other _PROTEIN_ activate transcription of floral meristem and organ identity genes such as _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . as shown in fig . fig refa _PROTEIN_ rna was present at a low level and _PROTEIN_ rna was not detected in wild type day and day seedlings . the same result was observed in and day seedlings containing the _METHOD_ transgene . however in seedlings that were homozygous fie with a _METHOD_ transgene _PROTEIN_ rna concentration was significantly elevated in day seedlings and _PROTEIN_ rna concentration was increased in both day and day seedlings . no effect on the _PROTEIN_ of other genes that accelerate flowering time _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or flowering locus t _PROTEIN_ was observed . because ectopic _PROTEIN_ of either _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ is sufficient to convert the normally indeterminate shoot apex to a floral meristem that _METHOD_ a terminal flower it is likely that aspects of the fie early flowering phenotype are due to their ectopic _PROTEIN_ . floral organ identity gene _PROTEIN_ was also affected by the level of _PROTEIN_ activity . whereas _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ rnas were not detected in control wild type seedlings or control seedlings with the _METHOD_ transgene both rnas accumulated in homozygous fie _METHOD_ seedlings . taken together these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ mediated polycomb complexes either directly or indirectly repress _PROTEIN_ of both floral meristem identity genes and floral organ identity genes during seedling development . to investigate the spatial regulation of gene transcription by _PROTEIN_ mediated polycomb complexes we determined the activity of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ promoters ligated to a _PROTEIN_ reporter gene in transgenic seedlings . as shown in fig . fig refb _PROTEIN_ transcription was restricted to the wild type seedling shoot apical meristem whereas there was no detectable transcription of the _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ transgenes in wild type seedlings . in contrast homozygous fie seedlings with the _METHOD_ transgene showed elevated _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ transcription in the shoot apical meristem cotyledon and hypocotyl regions . these results show that _PROTEIN_ mediated polycomb complexes either directly or indirectly repress transcription of floral meristem identity and floral organ identity genes in the aerial seedling . when does repression of flowering and floral promoting gene transcription begin ? one possibility is that aspects of floral repression initiate early in plant development during embryogenesis . to test this hypothesis embryo rna was isolated from self pollinated plants heterozygous for fie and homozygous for the _METHOD_ transgene . twenty five percent of these embryos are homozygous for fie and the _METHOD_ transgene . control wild type embryo rna was also isolated . semiquantitative reverse transcription pcr analysis indicated that the level of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ rna was elevated in the population that included homozygous fie _METHOD_ embryos . in this experiment we could not detect _PROTEIN_ embryo rna in either embryo population perhaps because a _PROTEIN_ not regulated by _PROTEIN_ is required for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in the embryo . finally _PROTEIN_ of control genes pk and apg was the same in both embryo populations . these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ mediated polycomb complexes function during embryogenesis either directly or indirectly to repress the _PROTEIN_ of specific floral meristem and organ identity genes .
seedlings were grown on hormone free agar plates _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ sucrose gamborg 's vitamins _PROTEIN_ and agar . plants were grown on soil under long day conditions . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ seed was provided by the arabidopsis biological resource center . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ seed were provided by d. weigel and t. jack . to construct a _PROTEIN_ green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ fusion protein the _PROTEIN_ cdna was amplified with primers _PROTEIN_ sal _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ ncoi digested with sali and ncoi and inserted into the _METHOD_ nos vector to obtain the _METHOD_ nos plasmid . the _METHOD_ gene used in these experiments lacks subcellular localization sequences . to have transcription of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion gene under the control of a _PROTEIN_ promoter base pairs of _PROTEIN_ flanking sequences were amplified with primers _PROTEIN_ sph and _PROTEIN_ salrv digested with sali and sph and inserted into the _METHOD_ nos plasmid to create the _METHOD_ nos plasmid . this plasmid was digested with psti and hindiii to liberate the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgene that was then inserted into replacing the _PROTEIN_ reporter to create plasmid pbi _METHOD_ that was introduced into agrobacterium . arabidopsis plants were transformed as described . transgenic plants were crossed with heterozygous fie plants and progeny were self pollinated to generate plants heterozygous for fie and homozygous for _METHOD_ . _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ was highly restricted compared with previously reported constructs and this result may be due at least in part to the process of creating a sali site in the _PROTEIN_ cdna that changed nucleotides to in the untranslated region from _PROTEIN_ to cga . to amplify endogenous _PROTEIN_ gene sequences we used primers and . because the primer is located in the first intron of the _PROTEIN_ gene it does not amplify any sequences associated with the _METHOD_ transgene . we distinguished fie and wild type _PROTEIN_ alleles by digesting the amplified products with xbai restriction endonuclease followed by agarose gel electrophoresis . the pcr amplified product from the wild type _PROTEIN_ allele is digested whereas the fie allele is not . to amplify _METHOD_ transgene sequences we used a primer in the _PROTEIN_ cdna region _PROTEIN_ rtf and a primer in the _METHOD_ cdna region _METHOD_ . pcr reactions were performed as described . seedlings with the _METHOD_ transgene were identified by growth on agar plates with kanamycin . rna was converted to cdna as described . amplification of cdna by pcr involved incubation at for min followed by cycles except when indicated at for s for s and for s. gene specific primers were as follows _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ actin _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ pk _PROTEIN_ apg _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ .
