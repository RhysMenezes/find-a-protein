the ado/fkf/lkp/ztl family of proteins of arabidopsis thaliana heynh . have a lov domain an f box motif and a kelch repeat region . _PROTEIN_ is a member of this family and functions either within or very close to the circadian oscillator in arabidopsis . promoter gus fusion studies revealed that the _PROTEIN_ gene was highly active in rosette leaves . in camv _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ plants _METHOD_ associated _METHOD_ was detected in _LOCATION_ suggesting that _PROTEIN_ is a _LOCATION_ protein . yeast two hybrid analysis demonstrated that _PROTEIN_ interacted with some arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ like proteins as do other ado/fkf/lkp/ztl family proteins suggesting that _PROTEIN_ can form an scf _PROTEIN_ complex that functions as a ubiquitin ligase . _PROTEIN_ interacted not only with itself but also with other members of the family _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . the two hybrid analysis also demonstrated that _PROTEIN_ interacted with _PROTEIN_ a clock component but not with _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ negative regulators of _PROTEIN_ gene _PROTEIN_ . the lov domain of _PROTEIN_ was shown to be necessary and sufficient for the interaction with _PROTEIN_ . an interaction between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ a paralogue of _PROTEIN_ was also observed but _PROTEIN_ did not interact with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ other paralogues of _PROTEIN_ .
the organ specific _PROTEIN_ mrna level had been examined previously mrna for _PROTEIN_ accumulated in rosette leaves flowers and siliques and small amounts of mrna were detected in roots _METHOD_ cauline leaves and seeds . to monitor the promoter activity of _PROTEIN_ transgenic arabidopsis plants containing an _PROTEIN_ promoter gus construct were generated . gus signals were detected in all parts of the seedlings but they were restricted to rosette leaves and root tips in week old rosette plants . in flowers gus activity was detected in sepals . gus signals were detected in young siliques but they were undetectable in old siliques . these results agree with the _PROTEIN_ mrna level detected by rt pcr suggesting that the kb promoter region has enough elements to regulate _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . to visualize the intracellular localization of _PROTEIN_ the camv promoter derived _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion construct was introduced into arabidopsis and high _PROTEIN_ lines were selected by rna gel blot analysis . the transgenic plants showed elongated hypocotyl and _PROTEIN_ flowering phenotype as observed in _PROTEIN_ plants suggesting that the introduced _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein functions in the transgenic plants . in those lines _METHOD_ associated _METHOD_ was distributed in _LOCATION_ but not in nucleoli and very strong _METHOD_ signals were detected throughout the cells of _METHOD_ plants . these data suggest that _PROTEIN_ is a _LOCATION_ protein . in arabidopsis more than f box proteins have been identified by genome analysis . however since these annotation data were _PROTEIN_ based on computer program analysis proteins that have no f box activity or have lost their activity during evolution may be included in these numbers . to examine whether _PROTEIN_ functions as an f box protein interaction tests were performed with arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ like proteins in a yeast two hybrid system . among ask proteins _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ tested _PROTEIN_ interacted with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . the interactions of _PROTEIN_ with ask proteins were similar to those of the other two with the ask proteins except with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . since amino acid sequences of f box regions of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are similar to each other _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ the ask preference _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ of these proteins is not surprising . furthermore _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ interact with a wide range of f box proteins in arabidopsis . the f box regions of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are sufficient to bind to ask proteins . in fission yeasts and mammals f box proteins were reported to function as homo and heterodimers . furthermore self dimerization of wc protein a lov domain containing a zn finger transcription _PROTEIN_ involved in blue light sensing in neurospora was reported . therefore the interactions of _PROTEIN_ with ado/fkf/lkp/ztl family proteins were examined by using the yeast two hybrid system . interactions were observed between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ but none were detected between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ by yeast growth tests on restricted medium . the interactions were also supported by the galactosidase activity . these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ may function in combination with lkp family proteins . the effects of light quality on yeast growth on restricted medium under different light conditions were examined but no growth differences were observed . from the analysis using _PROTEIN_ plants _PROTEIN_ was postulated to function either within or very close to the circadian oscillator . since _PROTEIN_ is a _LOCATION_ protein an interaction analysis of _PROTEIN_ was performed with _LOCATION_ localized clock associated _PROTEIN_ . in the growth test on sd medium lacking ade his leu and trp a strong interaction of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ was detected and a weak interaction of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ was detected . these interactions were also observed when the bait/prey configuration was inverted . no interaction between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ was observed . no interaction of _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ was detected . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ also did not interact with _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ . the galactosidase activities were tested to confirm these interactions . strong galactosidase activities were detected in yeasts possessing _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ constructs and weak activities were detected in yeasts possessing _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ constructs . no significant galactosidase activities were detected in yeasts possessing any other combination of constructs assayed . these results also suggest that _PROTEIN_ can interact with both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ but not with _PROTEIN_ . none of the interactions were affected by any light quality treatment that was performed . the portion of the _PROTEIN_ polypeptide that binds to _PROTEIN_ was also localized by the yeast two hybrid system . six constructs that _PROTEIN_ either one or two domains of _PROTEIN_ were examined . interactions between the lov domain containing peptides and _PROTEIN_ were detected but no interactions were detected between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ peptides without the lov domain in this two hybrid system . these results indicate that the lov domain of _PROTEIN_ is necessary and sufficient for the binding of _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ is a component of a central oscillator in arabidopsis and _METHOD_ a feedback loop with the myb like dna binding proteins _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . on the other hand there are four _PROTEIN_ paralogues in arabidopsis namely _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . to analyse the specificity of _PROTEIN_ binding _PROTEIN_ family proteins were used for two hybrid analysis . as in the case of _PROTEIN_ a strong interaction was detected between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and a weak interaction was detected between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . these interactions were also observed when the bait/prey configuration was inverted . no other interactions were detected between lkp family proteins and any other _PROTEIN_ family proteins . light quality did not affect the interaction between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in those examined . the portion of _PROTEIN_ polypeptide that binds to _PROTEIN_ was also determined by the yeast two hybrid system . as in the case of _PROTEIN_ the lov domain of _PROTEIN_ is necessary and sufficient for the binding of _PROTEIN_ .

enzyme sites subcloned into topo and sequenced entirely to verify the sequences . the primers used for pcr were the following _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and tctcggatccgatcaagtacttgcagtggt for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ for _PROTEIN_

acccgggtatgaatgctaatgaggaggggg and acccgggttagctatcctcaatgtttttta for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and tggatcctcatgattttgtagacgcgtctg for _PROTEIN_ . these pcr primers were also used for the rt pcr . each domain construct of _PROTEIN_ was also constructed by pcr subcloned into topo and sequenced entirely to verify the sequences . the primers used for pcr were the following _PROTEIN_ and tggatccttagggcccaggccttctaggaatttcttttgc for the lov domain of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and tggatccttacctttttgcaccgggaacac for the f box region of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and tctcggatccgatcaagtacttgcagtggt for
