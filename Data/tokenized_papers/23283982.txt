the exocyst complex localizes to distinct foci at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ of arabidopsis thaliana cells . their localization at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ is insensitive to bfa treatment but is _PROTEIN_ in an exocyst subunit mutant . in turn exocyst subunit mutants show _PROTEIN_ exocytosis .
in arabidopsis thaliana green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ tagged exocyst subunits _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are enriched at the outer pm of root epidermal cells and localize strongly to postcytokinetic cell plate _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ . the pm signal is not homogeneous and we occasionally observed dim spots at high magnification using the confocal laser scanning microscope _PROTEIN_ . to achieve higher spatial resolution and to separate the signal of exocyst subunits at the pm from the _METHOD_ of subunits in cytoplasm we used variable angle _METHOD_ microscopy which enables illumination of objects in close proximity to the microscope slide . we examined roots of arabidopsis seedlings _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ under the control of genomic promoters and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ under the control of the constitutive promoter _PROTEIN_ . functionality of the exocyst subunit localizations is corroborated by the ability of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion proteins to complement mutations in the respective genes _PROTEIN_ . we observed localization of _METHOD_ signal into distinct foci at the pm . in the meristematic zone it was sometimes difficult to distinguish individual foci and therefore we determined the density of the foci in elongation and maturation zones . density _PROTEIN_ from the root meristematic zone to the maturation zone from to this difference was statistically significant for the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ subunits . exocyst subunits colocalize in distinct foci at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . _PROTEIN_ section of arabidopsis root _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . the signal decorates outer epidermal pm . in recently divided cells the exocyst is focused on the maturing cell walls . exocyst subunits form distinct foci at the pm when observed by vaem . foci appearance is shown in the pm of outer epidermal root cells in elongation and root hair zones . scale bars . exocyst foci density in root epidermal cells n cells for each column _LOCATION_ bars sds . quantification of the exocyst subunits and _PROTEIN_ colocalizations in arabidopsis root epidermal cells . pairs indicated in e were evaluated . green red and yellow colors represent _METHOD_ only _METHOD_ only and their colocalization respectively . localization of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ exocyst subunits . green red and yellow circles denote _METHOD_ only _METHOD_ only and _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ positive foci respectively . scale bars . to test whether exocyst subunits colocalize in the pm foci we crossed arabidopsis plants _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ tagged exocyst subunits with plants _PROTEIN_ monomeric red _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ subunits . the _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ labeled foci colocalized in . we also observed a high proportion of only _METHOD_ labeled foci and a small proportion of only _METHOD_ labeled foci in all combinations . probably due to silencing of the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ transgene we were unable to obtain any _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ positive plants in the progeny of the respective crosses . patterns of endocytic events in arabidopsis epidermal cells when visualized by dynamin related proteins and the clathrin light chain protein fusions resemble that of exocyst foci . we therefore analyzed possible colocalization of _PROTEIN_ morange with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and found that it was low similar to the colocalization of exocyst foci caused by a random overlap . exocyst foci dynamics . a kymographic representation of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ at the pm of an elongating root epidermal cell . arrowhead points to _PROTEIN_ movement of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in the vertical direction . horizontal and vertical bars represent s and respectively . a kymographic representation of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ colocalization in the exocyst foci . recruitment of new _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ molecules is apparent . the horizontal and vertical bars represent s and respectively . frap of exocyst subunits at _PROTEIN_ pm of elongating root epidermal cells . each curve was constructed from frap experiments the individual measurements are represented by dots . histogram showing distribution of exocyst foci lifetimes measured in kymographs n foci for each subunit . taken together the results show exocyst subunits colocalized in the pm foci that were clearly distinct from endocytic sites marked by _PROTEIN_ . the exocyst labeled foci displayed limited spatial motility that preceded or followed dwelling of the foci at the pm . the signal usually appeared and remained localized to an identical site and vanished eventually . to monitor the foci behavior in time we used kymographic representations of the time series where the bona fide exocytic events appear as a straight line . the signal intensity typically increased after its appearance and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ before its disappearance . there was no prevailing pattern of signal maxima or minima during the event . exocyst subunits colocalized in the foci during the whole event . the median lifetime of exocyst foci in cells of elongation and root hair zones as determined from kymographs was and s for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ respectively . the lifetime distribution was similar for all exocyst subunits tested . to assess the exocyst turnover at the pm and to measure the turnover of the bulk of exocyst subunits we performed _METHOD_ recovery after photobleaching experiments using _PROTEIN_ . we infer from the frap curves that the mobile fraction of exocyst subunits is high representing . the _METHOD_ recovery half time was and s for the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ subunit respectively . the frap experiments show that the exocyst subunits cycle between cytoplasm and pm approximately on the order of tens of seconds for all four subunits studied . the frap values were higher than the foci lifetimes which can be caused by the _PROTEIN_ that the laser also bleaches populations of foci in adjacent focal planes . the exocyst is known to be sensitive to actin disruption in yeast cells . first we analyzed the possible colocalization of the exocyst _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ with the actin marker lifeact _METHOD_ and found no significant colocalization . second upon min of actin disruption by latrunculin b the exocyst appearance remained unaffected . after h latb treatment exocyst foci were still present however in some cells the foci aggregated into clusters . the effect was more obvious when using the _PROTEIN_ as the latb effect was pronounced in the epidermal cells below the _PROTEIN_ root cap and these cells are inaccessible for vaem . the exocyst aggregated into cell corners and formed clusters of intensive signal in epidermal cells in the elongation zone . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _LOCATION_ in root epidermal cells . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ does not colocalize with actin as visualized by lifeact _METHOD_ . short term actin disruption does not influence the appearance of exocyst foci . scale bars . localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and microtubules _METHOD_ . after min

_METHOD_ in _PROTEIN_ root sections h after disruption of actin and control . hyperpolarization of the exocyst signal is obvious in e. scale bars . frap curves demonstrate retarded recovery of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ at the pm of the epidermal root cells upon h treatment by latb . mt disruption had no effect . _LOCATION_ bars sds n . the exocyst is known to associate with microtubules in animals . however we did not observe any significant colocalization when _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was _PROTEIN_ with the _METHOD_ mt marker . the exocyst appearance at the pm remained unchanged after either min or h mt disruption by amiprophos methyl . we further examined possible cytoskeletal drug effect on the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ turnover at the pm using frap . whereas h mt disruption had no obvious effect h actin disruption led to a significant retardation of exocyst recruitment to the pm . these data indicate that although cytoskeletal _METHOD_ are not essential for exocyst localization at the pm in the short term long term actin disruption leads to changes in exocyst localization and its dynamics at the pm . the exocyst complex is supposed to function as a vesicle pm tethering machinery . to address the mechanism of exocyst complex function we asked whether the observed exocyst foci also harbor secretory vesicles tethered to the pm . we attempted to visualize secretory vesicles using the secretory marker _METHOD_ but did not observe any vesicle like events using vaem . exocytic vesicles harbor v snare proteins that eventually form snare complexes with their pm counterparts . therefore we tagged _PROTEIN_ v snare _PROTEIN_ in root cells which has been used as a marker of exocytosis in plants _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ the fusion protein in arabidopsis under the control of its native promoter . using _PROTEIN_ we observed signal in endosomal compartments and a pm signal that was strong at the outer pm of root epidermal cells . the fusion protein also labeled growing cell plates . the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ signal localized to the pm and also to distinct foci likely vesicles _PROTEIN_ when observed by vaem . the putative vesicles were moving beneath the pm and a subpopulation of the foci was tethered at the pm . dwelling of some foci followed or preceded their movement . it is possible that these foci correspond to exocytic and endocytic foci but we were unable to distinguish between the two types of events . colocalization of exocyst foci with vesicle marker and electron microscopy analysis of the _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ of root epidermal cells . comparison of _PROTEIN_ exocyst foci and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ localization and dynamics visualized by vaem . _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ localizes to epidermal pm and endosomes and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signal is prominent at the outer epidermal pm whereas _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ is evenly distributed along the entire pm the seemingly stronger signal of the intercellular _LOCATION_ results from summing of the adjacent pm signal . kymographs demonstrate that _PROTEIN_ and exocyst label pm localized foci with similar appearance . _PROTEIN_ foci dwelling at the pm are preceded by movement of the foci . motile foci and endosomes are visible in the kymograph . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ is highly dynamic compared with _PROTEIN_ labeled foci . scale bars horizontal and vertical bars represent s and respectively . colocalization of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ foci and quantification of the colocalization . the random overlap quantification is shown on the right . note the weak pm signal of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ apart from the larger foci . kymographic representation of the colocalization between _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ horizontal and vertical bars represent s and respectively . hpf afs electron microscopy analysis of the _PROTEIN_ pm of arabidopsis root epidermal cells . table summarizing the length and area of _PROTEIN_ pm analyzed and number of visible vesicles . from the actual vesicle number observed it is clear that only a subset of exocyst foci are tethering a vesicle . numerous _LOCATION_ and endomembranes are apparent in f but no vesicles are tethered below the _PROTEIN_ pm . in the lower cell paramural bodies are present . an example of vesicle tethered at the pm is shown in g note also the presence of numerous vesicles in the cytoplasm close to the _LOCATION_ . magnified inset from the distance of the vesicle from the pm is nm . scale bars in f and g and nm in i . the pattern of the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ foci resembled that of exocyst foci . we tested the colocalization between _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and the by _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ as this construct proved reliable and had stronger signal than _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ colocalized with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ at the _PROTEIN_ pm but not in the endosome like compartments when observed by _PROTEIN_ . when vaem was used exocyst foci colocalized with the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ putative vesicles tethered at the pm in of the foci observed whereas the colocalization caused by a random overlap was . a portion of the exocyst foci is thus associated with putative secretory vesicles . however the question remains whether the remaining foci also tether vesicles . we further attempted to visualize a pm localized t snare protein . the _PROTEIN_ t snare is _PROTEIN_ ubiquitously during all plant developmental stages suggesting that it could be involved in constitutive pm trafficking _PROTEIN_ . _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ appeared as a pm signal using _PROTEIN_ . with vaem the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signal localized to motile foci of high density probably representing _PROTEIN_ protein clusters . unlike the exocyst subunits it was difficult to distinguish individual foci and thus impossible to determine their actual density . when we compared the kymographs of exocyst subunits and the _PROTEIN_ foci it was obvious that _PROTEIN_ foci exhibited substantially higher motility and we did not observe any long lasting exocyst like foci in the case of _PROTEIN_ . due to the motility and short _PROTEIN_ dwelling times the potential colocalization would not be observable in the time resolution achieved during the sequential imaging of the green and red channels . if all exocyst foci do tether a _LOCATION_ bound vesicle these would be discernible using electron microscopy . high pressure freezing automated freeze substitution electron microscopy is commonly used to analyze endomembrane processes as the sample is fixed within a fraction of a second thus preserving all endomembrane structures . we fixed the epidermal cells of arabidopsis root tips using hpf afs and examined the _PROTEIN_ pm for the presence of tethered vesicles . in total we analyzed of the _PROTEIN_ pm of epidermal root cells . the sections examined were nm _PROTEIN_ . the approximate diameter of secretory vesicles in arabidopsis is nm . therefore the area of _PROTEIN_ pm examined is roughly _PROTEIN_ . if all exocyst foci harbored vesicles we would observe vesicles but instead we observed only vesicles in the vicinity of the _PROTEIN_ pm of epidermal cells . recently it was reported that the exocyst associates with double _LOCATION_ structures that are secreted into the apoplast however we observed only structures distantly resembling these paramural bodies often found in corners of epidermal cells . to test the hypothesis that the exocyst localizes to the pm even without the presence of a vesicle we used an approach with a higher throughput than transmission electron microscopy imaging and blocked exocytosis using the arf gef inhibitor brefeldin a which causes the aggregation of the trans _LOCATION_ network and partially inhibits exocytosis _PROTEIN_ . after h treatment of d seedlings with bfa the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ signal in root epidermal cells aggregated in so called bfa compartments and its intensity on the pm _PROTEIN_ indicating that exocytosis was inhibited . on the contrary _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ tagged exocyst subunits did not exhibit such behavior and their signal persisted completely at the pm . note that the analysis of _PROTEIN_ vaem images was very difficult due to the signal of the endomembrane compartments present beneath the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . after bfa treatment of _PROTEIN_ the pm signal _PROTEIN_ whereas the underlying endomembrane particles were still present therefore we did not analyze the bfa treated samples using vaem but used confocal microscopy instead . the exocyst is insensitive to brefeldin a treatment . plants _PROTEIN_ exocyst subunits and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusions were treated with bfa for h as indicated . the exocyst subunits remained localized on the _PROTEIN_ pm in the root epidermal cells whereas the _PROTEIN_ aggregated in bfa compartments . scale bars . in summary the partial colocalization with the _PROTEIN_ v snare the lack of tethered vesicles at the _PROTEIN_ pm as examined by hpf afs and the insensitivity of the exocyst to bfa demonstrate that the exocyst foci represent sites of exocyst complex docking at the pm that occur also without the presence of secretory vesicles . thus the exocyst foci probably form at preexisting sites capable of vesicle tethering . the exocyst is an octameric protein complex and loss of function mutations of its subunits result in developmental defects implying that it needs all of its components for proper functioning . to test whether exocyst foci are altered in cells lacking one of the exocyst components we _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ subunit in the _PROTEIN_ exocyst mutant . we compared phenotypically wild type plants _PROTEIN_ with the mutants . in the latter the pm incidence of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ foci was _PROTEIN_ as manifested in a conspicuously _PROTEIN_ density of the foci at the _PROTEIN_ pm of the elongation zone . the foci sometimes formed clusters at the pm which were never observed in wild type controls . mutations in exocyst subunits _PROTEIN_ the incidence of exocyst foci at the pm and lead to a _PROTEIN_ in exocytosis . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ exocyst foci in wild type and _PROTEIN_ mutant root epidermal cells scale bars . quantification of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ foci density in _PROTEIN_ wild type and mutant cells _LOCATION_ bars sds n and cells for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ wild type respectively . _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ localizes to the _PROTEIN_ pm and endomembranes in the wild type and _PROTEIN_ phenotypic wild type cells . in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ exocyst mutants _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ localization to the _PROTEIN_ pm _PROTEIN_ and in turn the signal of endomembrane compartment increases . calibration bar of the color coding is shown on the right scale bars . quantification of the _PROTEIN_ pm domain/cytoplasmic signal intensity ratio in wild type _PROTEIN_ wild type and _PROTEIN_ mutants . the _PROTEIN_ mutants were not quantified due to the lack of signal at the pm . n cells in seedlings n cells in seedlings _PROTEIN_ and n cells in seedlings _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ bars sds . if the exocyst foci indeed represent pm sites with vesicle tethering capacity then the _PROTEIN_ in exocyst foci density should result in _PROTEIN_ exocytosis . in root epidermal cells _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ is partitioned between the pm and endomembrane compartments . the strong signal at the _PROTEIN_ pm likely results from intensive exocytosis . the ratio of the pm and endomembrane signals can then be used as an approximation for ongoing exocytosis . therefore we examined _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ exocyst mutants . the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants are dwarf plants with pleiotropic developmental defects _PROTEIN_ . in both lines the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ localization differed dramatically from the wild type the _PROTEIN_ pm signal was lost and the protein was present in the cytoplasm and the endomembranes . we further analyzed the localization of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in the _PROTEIN_ mutant which is less severely affected and its cell types can be directly compared with wild type . in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ pm domain localization typically _PROTEIN_ and the signal in the endomembrane compartments increased although some mutant cells resembled wild type cells . to quantify this observation we determined the ratio of the _PROTEIN_ pm domain signal to the entire cytoplasmic signal . this ratio was lower in _PROTEIN_ mutants than in phenotypically wild type siblings and wild type plants . we were unable to compare the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ signal using vaem microscopy as the endomembrane compartments accumulated below the pm in the mutant plants hamper such an analysis similar to the situation in bfa treated samples . in summary the absence of the _PROTEIN_ subunit leads to a _PROTEIN_ recruitment of the _PROTEIN_ subunit to the pm . this indicates that the exocyst docking function was impaired in the _PROTEIN_ mutant plants . in turn exocytosis _PROTEIN_ in these plants as inferred from the localization of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . a plausible explanation of this effect is that the cells face difficulties in exocytosis due to the inability to tether vesicles to the pm . such inability may well explain morphological and developmental defects of the _PROTEIN_ mutant .
we used a leica microscope _METHOD_ with total internal reflection _METHOD_ illumination and an hcx pl apo oil objective . the penetration depth was set to nm roughly corresponding to angles of and the exposure time to _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . note that the set penetration depths do not necessarily reflect the actual physical penetration depths due to the intricate optical system of interfaces with various refractive indexes the glass medium medium cell wall and cell wall cytoplasm interfaces . excitation at nm and the _METHOD_ filter were used for imaging of _METHOD_ . excitation at and nm the quadp t cube and and filters were used for _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ sequential imaging . relative focus correction was used for colocalization imaging to compensate for the _PROTEIN_ that different wavelengths appear at different focal depths . the system equipped with a _PROTEIN_ camera was controlled by _PROTEIN_ af software . frap experiments were performed using the zeiss lsm duo _PROTEIN_ with the zeiss c apochromat water corrected objective . all images were acquired using identical settings image size was pixels the region of interest was bleached using iterations of a nm laser at laser power and and frames by s steps were acquired before and after bleaching respectively . root tips of d old seedlings of a. thaliana were excised immersed in bovine serum albumin and frozen immediately in a high pressure freezer _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . freeze substitution was carried out using a leica em afs _METHOD_ in dry acetone containing uranyl acetate and glutaraldehyde over a d period as follows for h increase for h for h increase for h and for h. samples were then slowly warmed to infiltrated stepwise over d at in spurr 's resin and embedded in capsules . the polymerization was performed at for h. ultrathin sections were made using an ultramicrotome and poststained in a leica em for min in uranyl acetate at and for min in lead stain at . grids were viewed with a jem transmission electron microscope operating at kv . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were transferred into _PROTEIN_ binary vector by the lr clonase ii enzyme mix . lifeact marker was amplified using and primers in a reaction without a template dna . the product was further reamplified using and primers to flank it with the attb sites . resulting product was transferred into the vector using the _PROTEIN_ clonase ii and further to the vector by the lr clonase ii . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was cloned by the three template pcr method . the _PROTEIN_ promoter region and _PROTEIN_ gene were amplified from a. thaliana genomic dna by using and and and primers respectively the _METHOD_ gene was amplified from the vector by using and primers . in a subsequent pcr resulting products were mixed and amplified using and primers . product of this three template reaction was transferred into and further to the binary vector by _PROTEIN_ clonase ii and lr clonase ii enzyme mix respectively . the construct was verified by sequencing the promoter region lacked the initial base pairs resulting in base pair promoter region . _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was transformed into a. thaliana _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ using the floral dip method . all pcrs were performed using the phusion polymerase . primers used are listed in . primers used . the columbia ecotype of a. thaliana was transformed using the floral dip method _PROTEIN_ . seeds of a. thaliana _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were kindly provided by m. h. sato and _PROTEIN_ morange by s. bednarek . generation of crosses between plants _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ and morange tagged proteins was used for evaluation of possible colocalization in the case of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ colocalization generation seedlings were used . to observe _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ foci in the _PROTEIN_ mutant we transformed the _PROTEIN_ line with the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ construct using the floral dip method . in the generation phenotypically homozygous plants were selected and compared with phenotypically wild type siblings . four day old arabidopsis plantlets grown on vertical agar plates were transferred with a block of agar beneath into a minute droplet of half strength murashige and skoog medium _METHOD_ supplemented with sucrose in a labtekii chambered coverglass and observed . five day old seedlings were used for frap experiments . for _LOCATION_ treatment mm latrunculin b in dimethyl sulfoxide and mm amiprophos methyl in ethanol were used . seedlings were transferred into _METHOD_ containing a dilution of the appropriate drug or equivalent volume of the solvent in controls incubated for min or h respectively and observed . the bfa experiment was conducted as follows d old seedlings _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ tagged exocyst subunits or _PROTEIN_ respectively were treated with mm brefeldin a diluted in _METHOD_ liquid medium . images of epidermal cells at root transition zone were taken after h treatment . all images were analyzed using imagej software . root growth was compensated using the correctstackdrift.txt macro . density of foci was determined in a rectangle of using the cell counter imagej plug in . _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ colocalization was analyzed as follows the first three images in a time series were averaged to enhance the signal of the stable foci . only cell areas where both channels were focused properly were used for evaluation . random overlap was determined in images where one of the channels was shifted by pixels . colocalization was determined by evaluating each labeled spot by eye in the assayed area and counted using the cell counter imagej plug in . kymographs were constructed from five pixel wide rectangles from each time point concatenated consecutively . to determine exocyst dynamics series obtained in s intervals were used to ensure proper coverage of both the short time and the long lasting events lengths of exocytic events were measured manually in kymographs . frap images were corrected for root growth and intensities were normalized as follows where at is the intensity in the bleached area at time t ct is the intensity in the control nonbleached area ab and cb are the intensities in the bleached and unbleached areas respectively immediately after the bleaching and av is the average at/ct intensity ratio in the five frames before bleaching . electron micrographs of epidermal root cells were checked for the presence of vesicles in the pm vicinity and the outer pm length was measured . evaluation of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ intensities at the pm and cytoplasm was achieved by creating a region of interest encompassing the entire cytoplasm and _PROTEIN_ pm domain respectively mean intensity was recorded and the ratio was calculated . all data were processed using the gnumeric spreadsheet and frap curves were fitted using gnuplot with the equation figures were assembled in imagej _PROTEIN_ and inkscape software and _METHOD_ were adjusted to obtain the best signal to noise ratio .
