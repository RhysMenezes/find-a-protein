leaf primordia with high division and developmental competencies are generated around the periphery of stem cells at the shoot apex . arabidopsis asymmetric _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ protein plays a key role in the regulation of many genes responsible for flat symmetric leaf formation . the _PROTEIN_ gene _PROTEIN_ in leaf primordia encodes a plant specific _LOCATION_ protein containing an _PROTEIN_ domain with cysteine repeats . _PROTEIN_ proteins are present in speckles in and around the nucleoli and in the nucleoplasm of some leaf epidermal cells . we used the tobacco cultured cell line by _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ fused yellow _METHOD_ protein to examine subnuclear localization of _PROTEIN_ in dividing cells . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ localized to speckles _PROTEIN_ in cells undergoing mitosis and distributed in a pairwise manner during the separation of sets of daughter chromosomes . few interphase cells contained _PROTEIN_ bodies . deletion analyses showed that a short stretch of the _PROTEIN_ amino terminal sequence and the c motif play negative and positive roles respectively in localizing _PROTEIN_ to the bodies . these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ bodies function to properly distribute _PROTEIN_ to daughter cells during cell division in leaf primordia and this process is controlled at least partially by signals encoded by the _PROTEIN_ sequence itself . the online version of this article contains supplementary material which is available to authorized users .
we made the xve _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ dna construct in which the coding sequence of _PROTEIN_ cdna was fused in frame to the coding sequence for yellow _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ . this fusion gene was driven by the estrogen inducible promoter and introduced into cells of the tobacco cultured cell line by . as described in we cultured the transformed by cells in liquid medium containing estradiol for h to induce transcription of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ gene . we then examined those cells for subcellular and subnuclear localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ proteins by observing randomly dividing cells for the _METHOD_ signals of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . as shown in fig . of interphase cells exhibited _METHOD_ signals in subnuclear speckles in and around the nucleolus in addition to the nucleoplasm . when only _METHOD_ was _PROTEIN_ in by cells the signal was detected _PROTEIN_ in the nucleoplasm as well as cytoplasm similarly as was seen in the remaining cells at interphase with

_METHOD_ were detected in several concentrated speckles in all mitotic cells . interestingly these speckles were observed to localize in pairwise patterns adjacent to both separating sets of daughter chromosomes after metaphase . there were no sets of daughter chromosomes that were not accompanied by the speckles even when only a small number of the speckles were present in the parental _LOCATION_ . the speckles appeared to be localized to regions among condensed chromosomes in the cells at prophase . from metaphase to telophase however the speckles seem to locate in peripheral regions of the chromosomes . since the signals of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in these phases were distinct from those of dapi speckles were not always associated with segregating daughter chromosomes . the numbers and sizes of speckles were variable from cell to cell although most of the cells at interphase and in mitosis contained speckles . the number of speckles in mitotic cells was also variable but interestingly the average numbers at metaphase and anaphase telophase were and respectively . in summary patterns of subnuclear localization of the _PROTEIN_ protein were dynamically altered during progression of the cell division cycle of by cells . _PROTEIN_ was consistently incorporated into several speckles in cells undergoing mitosis and also in a small portion of cells at interphase conversely _PROTEIN_ was also dispersed in the nucleoplasm of almost all cells at interphase . we hereinafter refer to these speckles in by cells as _PROTEIN_ bodies . to seek for internal regions of the _PROTEIN_ protein that might be responsible for its sub _LOCATION_ localization patterns we introduced a series of deletions into the _PROTEIN_ moiety in _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and investigated the localization patterns of signals from the _METHOD_ fusions . as shown in fig . b of cells that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ which had a deletion of the amino terminal short sequence exhibited _METHOD_ signals in _PROTEIN_ bodies during interphase . thus the proportion of cells that generate _PROTEIN_ bodies increased markedly suggestive of a negative role for the n terminal sequence of _PROTEIN_ protein in the formation of the _PROTEIN_ bodies during interphase.fig . localization of wild type _PROTEIN_ and its deletion mutants that were fused to _METHOD_ . a schematic representation of wild type and

_METHOD_ were observed in the nucleoplasm in all randomly dividing by cells at interphase which suggests that the c motif is required for the localization of _PROTEIN_ protein to _PROTEIN_ bodies . we deleted the _PROTEIN_ terminal domain of _PROTEIN_ in the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion designated _PROTEIN_ . figure b shows that _METHOD_ signals in only a small portion of the interphase cells were visible in _PROTEIN_ bodies . these results demonstrate that the c terminal domain is not involved in the formation of _PROTEIN_ bodies in interphase . signals from _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ that contained only the _PROTEIN_ domain sequence b which is highly conserved in all members of the _PROTEIN_ family were localized to _PROTEIN_ bodies in of cells at interphase showing that the _PROTEIN_ domain is sufficient for the _PROTEIN_ body formation . in the preceding sections we have shown that the n terminal short sequence and the c motif have negative and positive roles respectively in the formation of _PROTEIN_ bodies in cells at interphase . we addressed how mutations of these _PROTEIN_ regions affect the formation of _PROTEIN_ bodies in cells during mitosis . in cells _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ pairs of _METHOD_ signals were detected in _PROTEIN_ bodies in all mitotic cells we examined which suggests that the n terminal short sequence and the c terminal half are not required for the formation of _PROTEIN_ bodies in mitotic cells . distinct speckles were not observed in cells _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ cm _METHOD_ however even during mitosis . these results show that the c motif is essential for the formation of _PROTEIN_ bodies in cells during mitosis as well as in interphase.fig . localization of deletion mutants of _PROTEIN_ in m phase
