this study of the arabidopsis thaliana nitrate transporter _PROTEIN_ reveals an important function for a _PROTEIN_ family member in phloem nitrate transport . functional analysis in xenopus laevis oocytes showed that _PROTEIN_ is a low affinity nitrate transporter . green _METHOD_ protein and _PROTEIN_ reporter analyses indicated that _PROTEIN_ is a _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ transporter _PROTEIN_ in the companion cells of root phloem . in _PROTEIN_ mutants nitrate content in root phloem exudates was _PROTEIN_ and downward nitrate transport was reduced suggesting that _PROTEIN_ may facilitate loading of nitrate into the root phloem and enhance downward nitrate transport in roots . under high nitrate conditions the _PROTEIN_ mutant showed enhanced root to shoot nitrate transport and plant growth . we conclude that phloem nitrate transport is facilitated by _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in root companion cells . in addition enhanced root to shoot xylem transport of nitrate in _PROTEIN_ mutants points to a negative correlation between xylem and phloem nitrate transport .
_PROTEIN_ is a member of the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ transporter family . according to phylogenetic analysis of the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ family _PROTEIN_ is classified together with _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in subgroup iv while _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are in subgroup i and _PROTEIN_ is in subgroup ii . the predicted protein sequence of _PROTEIN_ shows and identity with that of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ respectively . similar to other reported _PROTEIN_ transporters _PROTEIN_ also contains putative transmembrane domains and a long hydrophilic loop between transmembrane domains and . some members of the _PROTEIN_ family are nitrate transporters examples being _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis and bn _PROTEIN_ in brassica napus while others such as at _PROTEIN_ and at _PROTEIN_ are di/tripeptide transporters . to elucidate the function of _PROTEIN_ it was heterologously _PROTEIN_ in xenopus laevis oocytes and the substrate specificity analyzed by two electrode whole cell clamping . as shown in figure compared with water injected oocytes at ph a larger current was elicited by mm in _PROTEIN_ injected oocytes but no current was elicited by mm leu leu mm gly gly or mm ala his . at all _LOCATION_ potentials tested nitrate but not any of the dipeptides tested could elicit an inward current in _PROTEIN_ injected oocytes . these data indicate that _PROTEIN_ is a nitrate transporter but not a dipeptide transporter . nitrate uptake activity of _PROTEIN_ was further confirmed by enhanced uptake activity of _PROTEIN_ injected oocytes . as expected for a proton coupled nitrate transporter with a proton/nitrate ratio larger than one an inward current was elicited by the negatively charged nitrate in _PROTEIN_ injected oocytes and the transport activity of _PROTEIN_ was ph dependent being higher at ph and lower at ph . different from _PROTEIN_ which shows dual affinity nitrate transport activity with high affinity nitrate transport activity when assayed with and low affinity transport with mm _PROTEIN_ only displayed low affinity nitrate transport activity . these results indicate that like most nitrate transporters in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ family such as _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ shows nitrate transport activity in the low affinity range . to determine the affinity of _PROTEIN_ for nitrate uptake activity of _PROTEIN_ injected oocytes at ph was measured using different concentrations of labeled nitrate ranging from to mm and the km for nitrate calculated by fitting to the michaelis menten equation was estimated as mm . taken together these functional studies in xenopus oocytes indicate that _PROTEIN_ is a low affinity nitrate transporter with a km of mm . quantitative rt pcr analyses of plants grown vertically on plates or hydroponically showed that _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in the root . the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in d old plants grown in ammonium nitrate or potassium nitrate was higher than that in plants grown with ammonium as the sole nitrogen source indicating that _PROTEIN_ is upregulated by nitrate after long time exposure . it is known that nitrate can rapidly induce the _PROTEIN_ of several nitrate related genes including _PROTEIN_ . this rapid transcriptional response has been referred to as the primary nitrate response . short term nitrate induction analysis showed that although _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was indeed rapidly induced by nitrate within min _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was unchanged by incubation with nitrate for at least h . in summary _PROTEIN_ is preferentially _PROTEIN_ in root tissues and its _PROTEIN_ is not rapidly induced by nitrate but is increased by long term nitrate exposure . to elucidate the _PROTEIN_ pattern in more detail promoter gus _PROTEIN_ reporter analysis was performed . the kb upstream region of _PROTEIN_ was used to drive the _PROTEIN_ of gus and the _PROTEIN_ gus construct was transformed into wild type arabidopsis plants . whole mount staining confirmed that _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in roots . if stained for an extended period weak gus staining could also be detected in the major veins of the leaves . enlarged images of the root revealed two strands of gus staining in the central stele while a cross section of the gus stained root showed that gus was _PROTEIN_ in the phloem and in the phloem pole pericycle cells of the root vascular stele . to confirm the tissue _PROTEIN_ pattern _PROTEIN_ protein localization in planta was determined by _PROTEIN_ of a _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ fusion driven by the _PROTEIN_ promoter . a kb genomic fragment of _PROTEIN_ including the kb promoter and coding region was fused upstream of the coding region for _METHOD_ and introduced into _PROTEIN_ mutant . as shown in figure consistent with the gus pattern a confocal section of root _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ showed that _PROTEIN_ was located in two rows of cells . in cross section the _METHOD_ signal was detected specifically in companion cells . compared with the specific _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in companion cells gus staining was more diffuse with an additional signal in the phloem pole pericycle cells . since diffusion is a common problem of gus staining it is likely that _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ in the companion cells of the root phloem . to determine the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ the _METHOD_ fusion protein driven by the cauliflower mosaic virus promoter was transiently _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis mesophyll protoplasts and the _METHOD_ signal was found to be confined to a _PROTEIN_ external to the chloroplast signal . thus _PROTEIN_ is a nitrate transporter localized in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . to determine the in vivo functions of _PROTEIN_ two independent t dna insertion lines _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ generated by gabi were obtained . in the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants the t dna was inserted in the second intron or the third exon of _PROTEIN_ respectively . no rna transcript was detected in either mutant by rt pcr using gene specific primers showing that both mutants are null mutants . since _PROTEIN_ is a nitrate transporter and is _PROTEIN_ in the companion cells of root phloem we speculated that _PROTEIN_ mediates nitrate loading into root phloem . to test this hypothesis the nitrate content of arabidopsis root phloem exudates was measured in the wild type and _PROTEIN_ mutants . the roots of d old seedlings were cut in the middle and placed in the exudation buffer . root phloem exudates were collected in humid _PROTEIN_ saturated boxes for h. as a control for nitrate efflux and apoplastic contamination of the previous growth medium roots of uncut seedlings were also placed in the exudation buffer . higher amounts of suc and nitrate but not glc were detected in phloem exudates of cut seedlings than the uncut seedlings suggesting that contamination of damaged cells from cut seedlings is low and like suc nitrate is also present in the phloem exudates . furthermore compared with the wild type similar suc but lower nitrate content was found in the phloem exudates from _PROTEIN_ mutants suggesting that _PROTEIN_ facilitates nitrate loading into root phloem . since root phloem is responsible for downward transport the influence of _PROTEIN_ on upward and downward nitrate transport was examined . grown seedlings were placed on segmented agar and the middle part of the root was treated with mm for h. the nitrate concentration in the shoot and the untreated bottom part of the root was measured to monitor root to shoot xylem transport of nitrate and downward phloem transport of nitrate respectively . as shown in figure nitrate concentration in the shoot was slightly higher in _PROTEIN_ mutants whereas the nitrate concentration in untreated bottom root was lower in the mutants . this result suggests that phloem loading of nitrate mediated by _PROTEIN_ may facilitate the downward phloem transport of nitrate and affect upward xylem transport of nitrate . to confirm that the upward xylem transport of nitrate was increased in _PROTEIN_ mutants root to shoot nitrate translocation was analyzed by submerging wild type and _PROTEIN_ roots in mm for min . the plants used were first grown in liquid medium with mm for d at which stage no statistically significant difference in growth was detected between the wild type and the mutants . after min of labeling the concentration of in the shoot was higher in both _PROTEIN_ mutants than in the wild type resulting in a higher shoot to root ratio of concentration in the mutants . consistent with this short term labeling result the shoot nitrate content of d old plants grown in mm was higher in _PROTEIN_ mutants than in the wild type but the root nitrate contents were comparable . the shoot to root nitrate content ratio in _PROTEIN_ mutants was also higher than that in wild type but under this condition the total n content was not changed in _PROTEIN_ mutants . it has been shown that _PROTEIN_ is involved in root to shoot nitrate transport by loading nitrate into xylem . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is similar in the wild type and in _PROTEIN_ mutant suggesting that enhanced root to shoot nitrate transport in _PROTEIN_ mutants is not due to enhanced _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in the mutants . taken together these data indicate that nonfunctional mutations of _PROTEIN_ which is _PROTEIN_ in companion cells of the root phloem enhance root to shoot transport of nitrate . unexpectedly under high nitrate conditions _PROTEIN_ mutants showed enhanced growth when plants were grown at low density on plate to examine the growth differences in individual plants . the enhanced growth phenotype of the _PROTEIN_ mutant could be restored to the wild type level by the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ construct further confirming that the growth phenotype is associated with _PROTEIN_ . furthermore this result shows that the promoter used in this construct and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein are functional and can represent endogenous _PROTEIN_ . when the medium contained ammonium as the sole nitrogen source or contained only a low concentration of no growth differences were detected between the wild type and _PROTEIN_ mutants . however when the medium contained higher concentrations of or _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ mutants exhibited increased growth . since no growth difference was seen between the wild type and the mutants when ammonium was the sole nitrogen source the growth difference observed in was due to the presence of nitrate . the fresh weight of _PROTEIN_ mutants grown on mm was to higher than that of the wild type . in the wild type the fresh weight increased when the medium nitrate concentration was increased from to mm but no further increase was seen when the medium nitrate concentration was increased from to mm . by contrast in the mutants growth increased with increasing nitrate concentration up to at least mm nitrate . thus the increased growth of _PROTEIN_ mutants was nitrate dependent and concentration dependent . these data suggest that _PROTEIN_ regulated long distance nitrate transport has an influence on plant growth in arabidopsis .
