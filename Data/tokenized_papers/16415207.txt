plant cells frequently undergo endoreduplication a process in which chromosomal dna is successively duplicated in the absence of mitosis . it has been proposed that endoreduplication is regulated at its entry by mitotic cyclin dependent kinase activity . however the regulatory _METHOD_ for its termination remain unclear although plants tightly control the ploidy level in each cell type . in the process of searching for regulatory _PROTEIN_ of endoreduplication the promoter of an arabidopsis thaliana cyclin a gene was revealed to be active in developing trichomes during the termination period of endoreduplication as well as in proliferating tissues . taking advantage of the situation that plants encode highly redundant cyclin a genes we were able to perform functional dissection of using null mutant alleles . null mutations of semidominantly promoted endocycles and increased the ploidy levels achieved in mature organs but they did not significantly affect the proportion of cells that underwent endoreduplication . consistent with this result _PROTEIN_ of the green _METHOD_ protein fusion protein restrained endocycles in a dose dependent manner . moreover a mutation in the destruction box of stabilized the fusion protein in the _LOCATION_ and enhanced the restraint . we conclude that negatively regulates endocycles and acts as a key regulator of ploidy levels in arabidopsis endoreduplication .
in the process of identifying cyclins that are involved in endoreduplication we found that the promoter of is active in trichomes . histochemical analysis using the escherichia coli _PROTEIN_ reporter gene showed that a kb dna region upstream of the initiation codon exhibits strong promoter activity preferentially in developing trichomes trichome socket cells root and shoot _METHOD_ vascular _METHOD_ and stomata guard cells and weak activity in many other tissues including developing leaf epidermis . in reproductive organs the styles pedicels and bases and vascular _METHOD_ of seedpods showed strong gus activity . in developing trichomes relatively stronger gus activity than in the surrounding cells was not observed at stage but became evident during the progression of stage . gus activity was evident also at stage and then gradually disappeared as the trichome matured . this temporal _PROTEIN_ pattern during trichome development is similar to that of cdka . assuming that is involved in regulating the endoreduplication of trichome cells it is likely to function in the termination but not the initiation of endoreduplication as developing arabidopsis trichomes undergo three of four endocycles before stage and complete the final one at stage . to investigate the function of in plant developmental processes we identified loss of function mutants of the gene . the lines and were obtained from the _PROTEIN_ . pcr using genomic dna as a template revealed that and have t dna insertions at positions and bp downstream of the initiation codon in the first and second exons respectively . rt pcr using total rna prepared from homozygous mutant plants amplified no transcripts corresponding to an internal region of the protein in either line indicating that both lines are null alleles of . therefore we further analyzed as a representative loss of function mutant unless indicated otherwise . homozygous mutant plants did not show any phenotype with morphology or growth rates obviously different from those of the wild type . however the _LOCATION_ in trichomes of the mutant plants were larger than those of wild type trichomes . the proportion of _LOCATION_ with large projection areas was higher in the mutant than in the wild type _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . moreover the distribution pattern of mutant _LOCATION_ exhibited an additional peak at a projection area position larger than the major peak . because it is thought that the major and additional peaks correspond to trichomes with ploidy levels of and respectively this result strongly suggests that the mutant contains a higher proportion of trichomes than the wild type . in addition to the enlarged _LOCATION_ the proportion of trichomes with four branches was significantly higher and that of three branch trichomes was significantly lower in the mutant than in the wild type . this observation supports the idea that the mutant trichomes have higher ploidy levels than wild type trichomes as the branch number of arabidopsis trichomes is thought to be positively correlated with the ploidy level . branch numbers of wild type and _PROTEIN_ trichomes to further investigate the effect of this mutation on ploidy we analyzed the ploidy distribution in cotyledons roots and first leaves using flow cytometry . the proportion of cells was not significantly affected by the mutation in any examined organs . however the mutation significantly increased the proportion of cells with a ploidy levels of or higher . this ploidy phenotype was analyzed in more detail in a time course experiment with developing first leaves . the proportions of and cells were lower and higher respectively in the mutant than in the wild type during a relatively early period of leaf development when cells with a ploidy level of or higher were not evident . during leaf development and cells became evident and increased in proportion earlier in the mutant than in the wild type with the higher ploidy levels showing greater time differences between the mutant and the wild type . the proportion of cells _PROTEIN_ earlier in the mutant . in _PROTEIN_ stages the mutant leaves showed almost the same proportions of and cells a lower proportion of cells and higher proportions of and cells compared with wild type leaves . these results indicate that the first endocycle occurs earlier and that subsequent endocycles succeed faster in mutant leaves than in wild type leaves although the proportion of cells that underwent endoreduplication during leaf development was the same . in fully expanded mutant cotyledons the ploidy phenotype was enhanced and cells which are not detected in wild type cotyledons were produced . this extra endocycle in cotyledons together with the evidently increased proportion of cells in mature first leaves indicates that the mutation also affects the ploidy levels finally achieved in these organs . homozygous mutant plants of the other line showed almost the same ploidy distribution patterns during leaf development and in cotyledons as that of confirming that the loss of function of is responsible for this ploidy phenotype . to investigate the functional manner of the ploidy levels of plants heterozygous for the mutation were compared with those of wild type and homozygous mutant plants . quantitative rt pcr analysis showed that transcripts were less abundant in the heterozygote than in the wild type . flow cytometry analysis of cotyledon cells of the heterozygote revealed a ploidy distribution pattern intermediate between those of the wild type and the homozygote . these results indicate that the mutation is semidominant and that the _PROTEIN_ level of negatively correlates with the ploidy level . to examine the effect of overexpression of the function on endoreduplication the _METHOD_ fusion protein was _PROTEIN_ . first to determine whether the fusion protein has the same function as the authentic protein functional complementation analysis was performed in plants under the control of the promoter which was used in gus histochemical analysis . although no _METHOD_ resulting from the _METHOD_ moiety was observed in the transgenic plants the fusion gene transcript was detected at various levels in seven transgenic lines through quantitative rt pcr . the ploidy phenotype in cotyledons was complemented almost completely in lines and which _PROTEIN_ the fusion gene at relatively high levels and was complemented partially or barely in lines _PROTEIN_ the fusion gene at relatively low levels . this result indicates that the fusion protein _METHOD_ the authentic function of in the regulation of endoreduplication and that its _PROTEIN_ also negatively correlates with the ploidy level . next the fusion protein was _PROTEIN_ ectopically using an estrogen inducible gene _PROTEIN_ system . to quantitatively analyze the effect of the fusion protein in the absence of the endogenous protein the transgene was introduced into plants . the transgenic plants showed no macroscopic changes either in the absence or the presence of the inducer . induced _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was observed in _LOCATION_ at various levels in different lines . figure shows the _METHOD_ of representative lines with low and high _PROTEIN_ levels in roots . the ploidy distributions in cotyledons and roots of these two lines were the same as in the transgenic parental line in the absence of the inducer . when the fusion protein was _PROTEIN_ the proportion of high ploidy cells was reduced to different levels depending on the levels of the fusion protein . in roots the proportion was significantly lower in line than in line . in cotyledons although the proportion was almost the same in the two lines the proportion of cells was significantly lower in line than in line . these results indicate that _PROTEIN_ of the gene and the _METHOD_ transgenes quantitatively restrains endocycles in a dose dependent manner . a type cyclins contain destruction box sequences which have been reported to mediate protein degradation . to _PROTEIN_ the _METHOD_ fusion protein at even higher levels we changed its d box sequence to a nonfunctional one and inducibly _PROTEIN_ the protein mdb _METHOD_ in plants . in the absence of the inducer the transgenic plants showed no changes in either macroscopic morphology or ploidy distribution patterns compared with the parental line . in the presence of the inducer the _LOCATION_ of these plants showed much stronger _METHOD_ _METHOD_ than those _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . this observation suggests that authentic is downregulated in planta by d box mediated protein degradation . _PROTEIN_ of this modified cyclin resulted in dwarfism but not in the complete growth arrest of plants . in the root apical region of the inducer treated plants root hair differentiation and vascular differentiation occurred closer to the root tip than normal . this phenotype suggests that the abnormal accumulation of the mutant protein retards the mitotic cell cycle in proliferating tissues because a similar phenotype has been reported as an effect of cell cycle arrest . in cotyledon pavement cells reductions in both size and shape complexity were observed . these results suggest that reduced levels of both cell proliferation and cell expansion caused the dwarfism . cotyledons and roots _PROTEIN_ mdb _METHOD_ showed relatively severe _PROTEIN_ in the proportion of high ploidy cells compared with those _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . this result is consistent with the idea that _PROTEIN_ quantitatively restrains endocycles depending on its _PROTEIN_ level . it is also notable that a significant increase in the proportion of cells was observed specifically in mdb _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ plants in both cotyledons and roots . the similar patterns of promoter activities of and cdka in developing trichomes suggest that and cdka form a complex that regulates endoreduplication . we performed an immunoprecipitation experiment to test whether has the ability to bind to cdka in planta . protein complexes containing mdb _METHOD_ in inducer treated roots were immunoprecipitated with an anti _METHOD_ antibody . after fractionation by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ the immunoprecipitates showed evident bands specific to mdb _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ plants at positions around and kd . the immunoprecipitates were examined for the presence of cdka by protein gel blot analysis with an antibody specific to the peptide sequence pstair which cdka only contains in arabidopsis . a signal band was detected at a position corresponding to the kd band indicating that mdb _METHOD_ binds to cdka in planta . the bands that were detected with the anti _METHOD_ antibody around kd are thought to correspond to mdb _METHOD_ and its derivatives . _METHOD_ was observed to be localized in _LOCATION_ . to examine the intracellular localization of cdka a cdka _METHOD_ fusion protein was _PROTEIN_ using the truncated cdka promoter which shows activity specific to developing trichomes . the fusion protein was localized evidently in _LOCATION_ of developing trichomes in the period from stage to early stage whereas its _LOCATION_ localization was observed throughout the period examined from stage to _PROTEIN_ stage . the period of _LOCATION_ localization coincides with that of promoter activity and includes the termination period of trichome endoreduplication . the possible coexistence of cdka and in the _LOCATION_ and their ability to physically interact strongly suggest that the proteins form a complex in the _LOCATION_ of developing trichomes during the period of endoreduplication termination .
