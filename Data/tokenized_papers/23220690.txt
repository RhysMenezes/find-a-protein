arabidopsis thaliana cell growth defect _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ has been implicated in promotion of proapoptotic bax like cell death via the induction of reactive oxygen species . here we report a conserved function of a chloroplast targeting cdf related gene responsive to senescence using crs overexpression and loss of function in plants as well as crs heterologous _PROTEIN_ in yeast . crs _PROTEIN_ was strongly induced in senescent leaves suggesting its _PROTEIN_ functions during plant senescence . crs _PROTEIN_ in yeast mitochondria increased the ros level and led to cell death in a manner similar to _PROTEIN_ . in whole plants overexpression of crs caused the loss of chlorophylls and the rapid onset of leaf senescence while the lack of crs led to the delay of leaf senescence in a loss of function mutant crs . the higher and lower accumulation of was correlated with early and _PROTEIN_ senescence in crs overexpressing and crs mutant plants respectively . furthermore _PROTEIN_ of senescence related marker genes and metacaspase genes was induced in crs overexpressing plants in response to dark . our findings suggest that crs plays a key role in the leaf senescence process that accompanies accumulation resulting in cell death promotion .
_PROTEIN_ induces apoptosis like cell death in yeast that resembles the lethality induced by bax in mammals . we have examined one of the cdf related genes crs that has not yet been functionally characterized . crs consisted of three exons and two introns with its open reading frame encoding a protein of amino acids for a calculated molecular _METHOD_ of kda . comparison of the amino acid sequences of three cdf related proteins revealed that the crs protein has a sequence identity to _PROTEIN_ . the sosui program predicted that crs contains four transmembrane domains in the c terminus and the targetp program predicted that it is a chloroplast protein . to verify the predicted subcellular localization of crs in cells we constructed transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ gene fused to the n terminus of crs under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus promoter _METHOD_ and observed _METHOD_ _METHOD_ in the protoplasts isolated . yellow _METHOD_ was detected in the chloroplasts of transgenic plants with the _METHOD_ crs construct in contrast in the transgenic control _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ only _METHOD_ yellow _METHOD_ was uniformly distributed throughout the cell . to confirm further the subcellular localization of crs in chloroplasts we introduced both _METHOD_ and green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ tagged crs _METHOD_ _METHOD_ into tobacco leaves via agrobacterium tumefaciens mediated infiltration and detected strong _PROTEIN_ of both _METHOD_ in chloroplasts . these results demonstrate that crs is a chloroplast localized protein . publicly available gene _PROTEIN_ data were analyzed as the first step to identify putative spatiotemporal regulation of crs _PROTEIN_ . an analysis of microarray data available at genevestigator revealed that crs is dominantly _PROTEIN_ in senescent leaves with other parts of adult plants _PROTEIN_ only very basal levels of crs . the analysis revealed that crs is one of the most abundantly transcribed genes during the senescence process . to investigate the _PROTEIN_ patterns of the crs gene in whole plants we fused kb of the crs promoter region to the _PROTEIN_ reporter gene in and transformed the construct into arabidopsis . the crs promoter was found to be a strong driver of gus _PROTEIN_ in senescent leaves of homozygous plants in the vegetative stage . in contrast gus was not detected in young buds of arabidopsis inflorescences but its _PROTEIN_ did gradually increase with increasing maturation of the flowers and was maximally _PROTEIN_ in the oldest open flowers . the reporter gene was also well _PROTEIN_ in the sepal and _PROTEIN_ but relatively more highly _PROTEIN_ in the anthers . within a senescing leaf gus was strongly _PROTEIN_ in the yellow tip region but less in the green basal region . all these findings indicate that crs has a major role in both senescing vegetative tissues and mature reproductive organs . to verify if crs has the same function as _PROTEIN_ in cell death we performed a yeast cell growth inhibition assay for crs . unlike _PROTEIN_ crs failed to inhibit cell growth in yeast . this may reflect the _PROTEIN_ that yeasts lack chloroplasts where crs appears to function in plant cells . to overcome the difference in subcellular organelles and test its putative function in cell death we fused the yeast mitochondrial signal peptide sequence to the n terminus of crs and repeated the spot assay . as shown in fig . yeast growth was inhibited by mtcrs . after h of yeast culture in sd galactose medium approximately and of mtcrs and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ cells respectively were stained with trypan blue a vital stain taken up by dead cells in contrast only of vector transformed negative control cells were stained with the dye . these results indicated that crs can cause cell death in a manner similar to _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ is known to induce cell death by increasing ros generation . we thus assessed the ability of crs to induce ros accumulation . the intracellular generation of ros in yeast cells can be detected using a non _METHOD_ dye dichlorofluorescein diacetate _PROTEIN_ which is taken up by the cells and oxidized by ros to the _METHOD_ compound dichlorofluorescein _PROTEIN_ thereby providing a quantitative measure of ros formation . after h of yeast culture in sd galactose medium _METHOD_ was detected in approximately and of mtcrs and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ cells respectively in contrast almost no _METHOD_ was detected in cells of the vector transformed negative control . these results implicate that crs can induce cell death through ros accumulation as _PROTEIN_ can . crs _PROTEIN_ in leaves at different stages of development was determined by reverse transcription pcr . rosette leaves were collected at three different stages of senescence namely non senescence early senescence and _PROTEIN_ senescence as categorized by citation . ns leaves had a basal crs _PROTEIN_ level while ls leaves showed a significantly higher _PROTEIN_ level of crs . the relative transcript level of _PROTEIN_ a marker gene of senescence was also significantly increased in ls leaves . within a senescent leaf crs _PROTEIN_ was strongest in the tip area which is the most senescent region of the leaf . these results together with publicly available information above confirm that the _PROTEIN_ of crs is closely associated with the progression of leaf senescence . rt pcr analyses using total rnas isolated from different organs of week old arabidopsis wild type plants revealed that under normal growing conditions cauline leaves and rosette leaves showed the highest level of crs _PROTEIN_ but flowers and _METHOD_ showed a relatively lower level of crs _PROTEIN_ with the root showing the lowest level of all plant organs analyzed . to understand the biological function of crs in whole plant senescence we generated transgenic arabidopsis plants overexpressing crs under the control of the promoter and subsequently selected two homozygous lines showing a much higher _PROTEIN_ of crs than the wild type . in addition a crs loss of function mutant line _PROTEIN_ was obtained from the gabi kat fst population . subsequent analyses verified the insertion of the t dna into the genomic dna sequence of the second exon of the crs gene and confirmed that the _PROTEIN_ of crs was completely abolished in the homozygous crs mutant . under normal growth conditions almost all young leaves of week old crs plants turned yellow while those of the wild type and crs mutant lines retained their green coloration . these results together with the published study of citation demonstrating that _PROTEIN_ shows enhanced _PROTEIN_ in senescent leaves led us to presume that _PROTEIN_ and crs have a functional redundancy during leaf senescence . senescence is known to be induced in dark treated leaves . thus to determine the extent of senescence in each plant type we observed the responses of wild type crs and crs mutant plants to dark treatment . wild type plants exhibited a visible yellowing phenotype after d in the dark with significant leaf senescence by d of dark treatment . in contrast no significant visible change was observed in crs leaves after d of dark treatment . the two independent crs lines showed a more rapidly yellowing phenotype than the wild type after d in the dark . the response to the dark treatment was monitored by measuring the chl content . the chl content of leaves on plants grown in the dark changed significantly in comparison with those grown under normal light conditions . seven days after dark treatment the chl contents of wild type crs crs and crs leaves were and respectively when compared with those of leaves grown under normal light conditions . these results support the notion that crs modulates the leaf senescence process including chl degradation . to determine whether or not the accumulation of a proposed signal molecule of senescence in arabidopsis differed in the leaves of the crs and crs mutant plants we examined the contents of detached third or fourth rosette leaves from week old plants exposed to dark treatment . the endogenous level was monitored using diaminobenzidine a histochemical reagent that is polymerized in the presence of to form reddish brown precipitates and a hydrogen peroxide/peroxidase assay . prior to the dark treatment dab staining and the hydroxide/peroxidase assay revealed that the rosette leaves of both the crs mutant and wild type plants had almost the same basal level of while those of crs plants contained a higher basal level of . the relative levels of in wild type crs and crs rosette leaves prior to dark treatment were about and respectively . however after the dark treatment the rosette leaves of crs plants clearly produced the highest amount of . taken together is more highly accumulated in crs leaves than in those of the wild type and crs mutant under normal light conditions and during senescence induced by dark treatment . to confirm further that the senescence associated function of crs is related to accumulation we examined the responses of detached third and fourth rosette leaves from wild type crs and crs mutant plants to a d exposure to various concentrations of . wild type and crs leaves showed the first signs of yellowing in mm while crs leaves started yellowing at mm . in addition with increasing concentrations the yellowing process appeared to progress more slowly in crs leaves than in wild type leaves . at mm the chl contents of the detached leaves of the wild type and crs plants _PROTEIN_ to and respectively compared with the control leaves while the chl content of leaves detached from crs plants was _PROTEIN_ to of that of the control leaves . in summary the leaves of crs plants are more tolerant to inducible senescence than those of wild type and crs plants . _PROTEIN_ is a ros inducible transcription _PROTEIN_ that promotes senescence processes . the _PROTEIN_ pattern of _PROTEIN_ is known to be induced in senescent leaves . these two senescence marker genes _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were analyzed by real time pcr to characterize the involvement of crs in the senescence process further . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in the leaves from wild type plants grown in the dark for d increased by > fold relative to that in leaves of untreated wild type plants . however the transcript level of _PROTEIN_ in the leaves of crs plants grown in the dark for d was about and fold higher than that in the leaves of untreated and treated wild type plants respectively . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was regulated similarly to that of _PROTEIN_ . the transcript level of _PROTEIN_ in the leaves of crs lines grown in the dark for d was about fold higher than that in the leaves of wild type plants grown under the same dark conditions . in comparison the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ was down regulated in crs mutant leaves to approximately and fold less than that in the dark treated wild type leaves . consequently crs _PROTEIN_ as well as that of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ is up regulated and the ros level is elevated during plant senescence . the loss of function mutant delays senescence by down regulating _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ with the reduction of ros level . our results indicate that crs induces cell death in yeast as _PROTEIN_ does . _PROTEIN_ is known to induce cell death in a similar manner to a mammalian proapoptotic protein bax . in mammals bax induces _PROTEIN_ activation that triggers apoptotic cell death . in arabidopsis there are nine predicted metacaspases that are structurally homologous to animal _PROTEIN_ . to determine whether leaf senescence promotion of crs correlates with the _PROTEIN_ level of metacaspases we compared the _PROTEIN_ of these nine metacaspase genes in dark treated wild type crs and crs mutant plants . during senescence two metacaspase genes _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were up regulated in crs plants and down regulated in crs mutant plants compared with the wild type . however the other seven metacaspase genes showed different _PROTEIN_ patterns . these results imply that crs may have a mode of action mechanism for plant senescence promotion that is similar to bax inducible mammalian cell death through _PROTEIN_ activation .
