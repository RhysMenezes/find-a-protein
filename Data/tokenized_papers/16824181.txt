we screened for mutants of arabidopsis thaliana that displayed enhanced disease resistance to the powdery mildew pathogen _LOCATION_ cichoracearum and identified the _PROTEIN_ mutant which formed large gray lesions upon infection with e. cichoracearum and supported very little sporulation . the _PROTEIN_ mediated disease resistance and cell death phenotypes were dependent on salicylic acid signaling but independent of ethylene and jasmonic acid signaling . in addition _PROTEIN_ plants displayed enhanced susceptibility to the necrotrophic fungal pathogen botrytis cinerea but showed normal responses to virulent and avirulent strains of pseudomonas syringae pv . tomato . the _PROTEIN_ gene was isolated by positional cloning and found to encode arabidopsis dynamin related protein _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ mutation caused an amino acid substitution in the _PROTEIN_ domain of _PROTEIN_ that is predicted to block _PROTEIN_ hydrolysis but not _PROTEIN_ binding . a t dna insertion allele in _PROTEIN_ did not cause powdery mildew induced lesions suggesting that this phenotype is caused by _PROTEIN_ being locked in the _PROTEIN_ bound state rather than by a loss of _PROTEIN_ activity . analysis of _PROTEIN_ green _METHOD_ protein fusion proteins revealed that _PROTEIN_ is at least partially localized to mitochondria . these observations suggest a mechanistic link between salicylic acid signaling mitochondria and programmed cell death in plants .
we screened ethyl methanesulfonate _METHOD_ mutagenized col plants with the strain of e. cichoracearum for enhanced disease resistance . from a screen of plants derived from parents we identified three _PROTEIN_ like mutants that we have designated _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and . the _PROTEIN_ mutant has already been described and the mutant remains to be fully characterized . here we describe the _PROTEIN_ mutant and _PROTEIN_ gene . in contrast to wild type col plants _PROTEIN_ mutant plants displayed very little powder and formed large lesions days after infection with e. cichoracearum . to ascertain at what stage fungal development was being arrested we stained infected leaves with trypan blue which stains fungal structures and dead plant cells . no obvious difference between wild type and _PROTEIN_ leaves was observed during the first days after inoculation and no epidermal cell death was observed in either wild type or _PROTEIN_ mutant leaves . the spores of e. cichoracearum germinated approximately h after inoculation and developed extensive branched hyphae on both col leaves and _PROTEIN_ leaves by day . however by day and day fewer conidiophores formed on _PROTEIN_ leaves than on col leaves . similar to the previously identified _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants the _PROTEIN_ mutant displayed large patches of dead mesophyll cells by days after infection with cell death becoming extensive by days after infection . such mesophyll cell death was not observed on col leaves and was not observed on _PROTEIN_ mutants prior to powdery mildew infection . these observations indicate that growth of e. cichoracearum was being arrested at a _PROTEIN_ stage of the infection process possibly due to nutrient deprivation resulting from _METHOD_ mesophyll cell death . to further characterize the _PROTEIN_ mutant we investigated whether _PROTEIN_ mutant plants displayed altered responses to virulent and avirulent strains of p. syringae pv . tomato . both col and _PROTEIN_ were susceptible to the virulent strain but resistant to the avirulent strain . the disease phenotypes displayed by _PROTEIN_ and wild type col plants were indistinguishable and there were no significant differences in bacterial growth . these data suggest that _PROTEIN_ does not function in regulating defense responses against virulent or avirulent p. syringae strains . we also inoculated the _PROTEIN_ mutant with a necrotrophic fungal pathogen botrytis cinerea the causal agent of gray mold . botrytis cinerea causes _METHOD_ of soft rot on more than different plant species including arabidopsis . wild type col plants are susceptible to this pathogen and mutations in the ethylene _PROTEIN_ and ja _PROTEIN_ pathways enhance susceptibility to b. cinerea while the sa pathway mutations _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ have no effect on resistance to b. cinerea . the _PROTEIN_ mutant displayed enhanced susceptibility to this pathogen producing significantly larger necrotic lesions than wild type col plants . in addition to resistance to powdery mildew the previously identified _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants display an enhanced ethylene induced senescence phenotype . unlike _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutant plants _PROTEIN_ plants displayed no visible difference from wild type col plants when treated with ethylene . this observation suggests that _PROTEIN_ may function in a pathway distinct from _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . to assess the roles of sa in _PROTEIN_ mediated disease resistance we crossed _PROTEIN_ to the sa deficient mutant _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ mediated powdery mildew resistance and cell death were suppressed by the _PROTEIN_ mutation indicating that _PROTEIN_ mediated disease resistance is dependent on sa . to further assess the requirement for sa induced defenses we created _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ double mutants . mutations in _PROTEIN_ block most sa induced defense responses while _PROTEIN_ mutations reduce accumulation of sa induced by some but not all pathogen strains . consistent with the results of the _PROTEIN_ analysis both the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and the _PROTEIN_ mutations suppressed the _PROTEIN_ mediated resistance to powdery mildew and cell death . to investigate whether ethylene and ja play a role in _PROTEIN_ mediated disease resistance we crossed the _PROTEIN_ mutant to the ethylene insensitive mutant _PROTEIN_ and to the jasmonate insensitive mutant _PROTEIN_ . in contrast to mutations that suppress the sa defense pathway the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutations did not suppress _PROTEIN_ mediated resistance . taken together the above data indicate that _PROTEIN_ mediated powdery mildew resistance depends on sa induced defense responses and is independent of defenses induced by ethylene and ja . the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mediated resistance phenotypes have also been shown to be dependent on sa induced defenses and independent of ethylene and ja signaling by similar double mutant analyses . because _PROTEIN_ mediated resistance depends on sa signaling we assessed whether the sa inducible defense gene pr was constitutively _PROTEIN_ . constitutive _PROTEIN_ of pr would indicate that the _PROTEIN_ mutation may simply disrupt cellular physiology leading to an elevation of sa levels that would provide a trivial explanation for the enhanced resistance to powdery mildew . however using rna gel blot analysis we observed no enhanced _PROTEIN_ of pr in _PROTEIN_ plants either before or after inoculation with powdery mildew . this result indicates that the _PROTEIN_ mediated resistance is not caused by constitutive _PROTEIN_ of sa inducible defense genes . this conclusion is consistent with the lack of enhanced resistance to p. syringae observed in _PROTEIN_ plants . although the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutations both confer a lesion phenotype induced by powdery mildew that is dependent on sa signaling the lesions on these two mutants have a qualitatively distinct appearance . in the _PROTEIN_ mutant the lesions are generally yellow brown in color and appear dry while in the _PROTEIN_ mutant the lesions are grayer and water soaked in appearance suggesting that these lesions may be induced by different pathways . to assess the relationship between lesions induced by _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ we crossed _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ and characterized the phenotype of the _PROTEIN_ double mutant . the double mutant displayed the _PROTEIN_ like lesion phenotype upon infection with powdery mildew indicating that _PROTEIN_ is epistatic to _PROTEIN_ at least at the level of mildew induced lesions . to map the _PROTEIN_ gene the _PROTEIN_ mutant was crossed to arabidopsis ecotype landsberg _LOCATION_ and scored for the mildew induced lesion phenotype in the generation . approximately of the plants displayed the lesion phenotype indicating that _PROTEIN_ is recessive . initially the _PROTEIN_ gene was mapped to a region between the microsatellite markers and on chromosome in a population of resistant plants . to further localize the _PROTEIN_ gene we developed new markers at intervals between these two markers using monsanto col and ler polymorphism data . five hundred and six resistant plants representing meioses were scored which allowed us to localize the _PROTEIN_ mutation to a region spanned by bacterial artificial chromosome clone _PROTEIN_ . this analysis defined a kb interval containing _PROTEIN_ . to identify the _PROTEIN_ gene we constructed a cosmid library using bac dna . four cosmid subclones of bac which overlapped and covered the entire _PROTEIN_ interval were identified and used to rescue the _PROTEIN_ phenotype . among these four subclones only cosmid clone complemented the _PROTEIN_ mutation with nine out of ten plants displaying the wild type susceptible phenotype . self progeny from these lines were obtained and assayed for resistance to powdery mildew . the susceptible phenotype co segregated with the t dna . sequencing of the vector insert junction fragments of cosmid revealed that it contained four full length genes _GENE_ _PROTEIN_ and _GENE_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . we sequenced all four of these genes from the _PROTEIN_ mutant and found a single mutation a transition in _PROTEIN_ which caused an amino acid change in the predicted open reading frame . no mutations were found in the other three genes . to confirm that _GENE_ is _PROTEIN_ we transformed two additional cosmid clones and into the _PROTEIN_ mutant . clone contained the complete _GENE_ gene but lacked full length copies of the other genes on clone while contained a truncated _GENE_ gene along with all three other full length genes on clone . clone complemented the _PROTEIN_ mutant phenotype while clone did not confirming that _GENE_ is _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ gene consists of exons and introns and encodes dynamin related protein _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ which is amino acid residues long has a predicted _METHOD_ of kda and a pi of . dynamin related protein belongs to a plant specific subclass of dynamin related proteins consisting of five members in arabidopsis . this class is characterized by having an n terminal _PROTEIN_ domain a central dynamin domain and a c terminal _PROTEIN_ effector domain a typical structure for plant dynamin related proteins . however this class lacks a ph domain and a proline rich domain which are found in classical animal dynamin like proteins . based on work on animal dynamins the plant proteins should be able to form polymeric structures that wrap around _LOCATION_ to facilitate _LOCATION_ tubulation and pinching off of vesicles processes that are essential to vesicle trafficking and _LOCATION_ compartmentalization . the _PROTEIN_ mutation causes a substitution in the _PROTEIN_ motif of the _PROTEIN_ domain of _PROTEIN_ . mutations in this domain of mammalian dynamin block _PROTEIN_ hydrolysis without significantly affecting _PROTEIN_ binding . such mutations also block endocytosis and lead to the formation of long tubular invaginations from the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ in _PROTEIN_ fibroblasts indicating that _PROTEIN_ hydrolysis by dynamin is required for pinching off of vesicles during endocytosis . because the _PROTEIN_ mutation is likely to alter _PROTEIN_ function rather than eliminate it we obtained a t dna insertion in _PROTEIN_ to assess whether loss of _PROTEIN_ function causes an _PROTEIN_ like phenotype . the salk t dna insertion line contains an insertion at amino acid position of _PROTEIN_ which is amino acids from the c terminus and is located within the central dynamin domain . this allele is thus unlikely to produce a functional protein . we confirmed the location of the t dna insertion by pcr based amplification of the t dna left border and direct sequencing of the pcr product . plants homozygous for the t dna insertion displayed no noticeable morphological or growth defects . they also showed normal susceptibility to infection by e. cichoracearum . this observation indicates that the _PROTEIN_ mutant phenotype is probably a gain of function phenotype despite the _PROTEIN_ that it is recessive and can be complemented by a single copy of a wild type transgene . to gain more insight into the function of _PROTEIN_ we investigated the subcellular localization of the _PROTEIN_ protein using a green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ fusion to the n terminus of _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ of this fusion protein in transgenic arabidopsis col plants under control of the constitutive cauliflower mosaic virus promoter revealed that _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ localizes to punctate spots in arabidopsis root cells indicating that _PROTEIN_ associates with an organelle . to assess whether these spots were mitochondria we stained transgenic arabidopsis roots with the mitochondrial specific _METHOD_ dye mitotracker red cmxros . the mitotracker _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ _METHOD_ co localized indicating that _PROTEIN_ associates with mitochondria at least part of the time .
