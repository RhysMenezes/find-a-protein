several recent proteomic studies of plant _LOCATION_ indicate that the peroxisomal _PROTEIN_ harbors multiple _PROTEIN_ dependent enzymes and chaperones . however it is unknown whether plant _LOCATION_ are able to produce _PROTEIN_ by substrate level phosphorylation or whether external _PROTEIN_ fuels the energy dependent reactions within _LOCATION_ . the existence of transport proteins that supply plant _LOCATION_ with energy for fatty acid oxidation and other _PROTEIN_ dependent processes has not previously been demonstrated . here we describe two arabidopsis thaliana genes that encode peroxisomal adenine nucleotide carriers _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . both proteins when fused to enhanced yellow _METHOD_ protein are targeted to _LOCATION_ . complementation of a yeast mutant deficient in peroxisomal _PROTEIN_ import and in vitro transport assays using recombinant transporter proteins revealed that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ catalyze the counterexchange of _PROTEIN_ with adp or amp . transgenic arabidopsis lines repressing both pnc genes were generated using ethanol inducible rna interference . a detailed analysis of these plants showed that an impaired peroxisomal _PROTEIN_ import inhibits fatty acid breakdown during early seedling growth and other oxidation reactions such as auxin biosynthesis . we show conclusively that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are essential for supplying _LOCATION_ with _PROTEIN_ indicating that no other _PROTEIN_ generating _METHOD_ exist inside plant _LOCATION_ .
to identify candidate genes encoding peroxisomal _PROTEIN_ carriers the arabidopsis genome was searched using the sequence of the s. cerevisiae peroxisomal _PROTEIN_ carrier _PROTEIN_ and the blast search algorithm . the three candidate genes showing highest similarity to _PROTEIN_ were selected for further analysis . _GENE_ encodes a protein of amino acids with a calculated molecular _METHOD_ of kd that shares identity with _PROTEIN_ . the _GENE_ gene product consists of amino acid residues has a molecular _METHOD_ of kd and is identical to the yeast carrier . the amino acid protein encoded by _GENE_ has a predicted molecular _METHOD_ of kd and shows identity to the yeast protein . a protein alignment revealed a strong similarity between _GENE_ and _GENE_ . both proteins display a weaker similarity to the corresponding protein of the third arabidopsis candidate _GENE_ . all three arabidopsis candidate genes belong to the so called mitochondrial carrier family . they possess characteristic sequence features typical for mcf members three repeats of a conserved mitochondrial energy transfer signature identified as by the prosite program and six predicted transmembrane spanning domains . the mcf is widespread in _METHOD_ animals and humans and several members of the mcf have been described as carriers with various functions and subcellular localizations . one of the candidate genes _GENE_ is annotated as peroxisomal _LOCATION_ protein kd _PROTEIN_ and was previously proposed to represent a peroxisomal _PROTEIN_ carrier . however biochemical data investigating its transport function or mutants deficient in this protein have not yet been reported . to investigate whether the three arabidopsis candidate genes identified in silico indeed encode peroxisomal _PROTEIN_ carriers we attempted genetic complementation of a yeast mutant deficient in _PROTEIN_ function . this knockout strain called _PROTEIN_ is unable to grow on media containing medium chain fatty acids such as lauric acid as the sole _PROTEIN_ source . in figure we show that heterologous _PROTEIN_ of _GENE_ or _GENE_ restored the capability of _PROTEIN_ to grow efficiently on lauric acid similar to mutant yeast cells _PROTEIN_ the endogenous _PROTEIN_ gene and the wild type strain transformed with an empty vector . by contrast the knockout yeast strain _PROTEIN_ _GENE_ failed to form colonies as did the _PROTEIN_ mutant transformed with the empty vector . these data indicate that the proteins encoded by _GENE_ and _GENE_ are able to mediate _PROTEIN_ import into yeast _LOCATION_ which is required for growth on lauric acid . to assess whether the gene products of the arabidopsis peroxisomal _PROTEIN_ carrier candidates were targeted to _LOCATION_ in yeast their subcellular localization was analyzed using _METHOD_ protein tagging in combination with _METHOD_ microscopy . the open reading frames of _GENE_ _GENE_ and _GENE_ were fused in frame to the n or c terminus of enhanced yellow _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ and transformed into the yeast mutant _PROTEIN_ . the _METHOD_ fusion proteins were coexpressed with a peroxisomal targeted _METHOD_ marker that consisted of the cyan _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ tagged with the peroxisomal target signal _PROTEIN_ at its c terminus . figure shows that _METHOD_ signals colocalized in yeast cells _PROTEIN_ both _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ fusions exhibited forming a punctuate pattern . these data indicate that all three candidate proteins are targeted to _LOCATION_ in yeast . importantly the _METHOD_ tagged proteins encoded by _GENE_ and _GENE_ complemented the mutant growth phenotype demonstrating that these _METHOD_ tagged plant proteins were functional in yeast _LOCATION_ . jointly complementation and subcellular localization data strongly suggest that _GENE_ and _GENE_ represent peroxisomal _PROTEIN_ carriers and thus were assigned the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ for arabidopsis peroxisomal adenine nucleotide carrier and respectively . although the third candidate _GENE_ is targeted to _LOCATION_ in yeast it does not complement the phenotype of the _PROTEIN_ mutant . it is thus unlikely that it functions as a peroxisomal _PROTEIN_ transporter . to assess whether _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are targeted to _LOCATION_ in plants as well young tobacco leaves were infiltrated with agrobacterium tumefaciens that were cotransformed with the corresponding _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ construct and a plasmid carrying the peroxisomal targeted marker _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . three days after infiltration tobacco epidermal cells were analyzed in vivo by _METHOD_ microscopy . the _LOCATION_ were visualized as blue _METHOD_ dots by the peroxisomal _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ marker construct . the _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ signals colocalized indicating that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ are targeted to _LOCATION_ not only in yeast but also in plant cells . while genetic complementation of a yeast knockout mutant deficient in its peroxisomal _PROTEIN_ carrier by _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ strongly indicated that the plant proteins encode peroxisomal _PROTEIN_ importers this experiment does not provide direct proof of protein function . to substantiate their transport properties we analyzed whether recombinant _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ reconstituted into liposomes were able to transport _PROTEIN_ in vitro . the peroxisomal _PROTEIN_ transport proteins from arabidopsis and the yeast _PROTEIN_ were _PROTEIN_ in the yeast knockout mutant _PROTEIN_ . _LOCATION_ proteins from the corresponding transgenic yeast cells were extracted directly reconstituted into liposomes and assayed for _PROTEIN_ import activity . the previously characterized _PROTEIN_ catalyzes the transport of _PROTEIN_ adp or amp in a strict counterexchange mode . thus the uptake of radioactively labeled _PROTEIN_ into proteoliposomes was measured in the presence or absence of a suitable counterexchange substrate . given that the mitochondrial _PROTEIN_ carriers from yeast are highly specific for _PROTEIN_ and adp respectively amp was selected as the counterexchange substrate to avoid possible background from mitochondrial _PROTEIN_ carrier activity . using this experimental setup no significant _PROTEIN_ uptake into liposomes reconstituted with _LOCATION_ proteins from _PROTEIN_ control cells containing the empty vector was measured . by contrast liposomes reconstituted with _LOCATION_ from the yeast mutant _PROTEIN_ either _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ showed a substantial _PROTEIN_ counterexchange activity . in the absence of amp no _PROTEIN_ uptake was observed . the transport rates obtained by both arabidopsis proteins were comparable to those observed for _PROTEIN_ further emphasizing that both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are able to catalyze an _PROTEIN_ exchange like their putative yeast ortholog . since we could not directly test whether yeast _PROTEIN_ arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are able to catalyze the exchange of adp with _PROTEIN_ due to the background activity of the yeast mitochondrial _PROTEIN_ carrier we also _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in escherichia coli which does not show endogenous _PROTEIN_ carrier activities . uptake of radiolabeled adp into proteoliposomes preloaded with either _PROTEIN_ adp or amp was measured for reconstituted recombinant proteins purified from e. coli . adp was efficiently taken up in the presence of the internal substrates _PROTEIN_ adp or amp but not in their absence . thus _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ represent nucleotide carriers with specificity for _PROTEIN_ adp and amp in a strict counterexchange mode like the yeast _PROTEIN_ transporter . a detailed knowledge of substrate affinity and specificity is required to understand the function of a transport protein in vivo . to determine the apparent km values of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ for _PROTEIN_ the initial rate of _PROTEIN_ uptake into amp preloaded proteoliposomes was measured at different external _PROTEIN_ concentrations . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ exhibit an apparent km value for _PROTEIN_ of and respectively whereas _PROTEIN_ has an apparent km value of for _PROTEIN_ . to assess the substrate specificity of the _PROTEIN_ carriers the inhibition constant was determined . for this the import of radiolabeled _PROTEIN_ into proteoliposomes preloaded with amp was measured in the presence of nonlabeled adp amp and inorganic ortho phosphate . for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ both adp and amp competitively inhibited the uptake of _PROTEIN_ whereas pi exerted no significant inhibitory effect . in addition the obtained apparent ki values shown in table exhibit similar ki/km ratios for all three recombinant proteins . the estimated ki values of adp are twofold to threefold higher than their corresponding km values for _PROTEIN_ . in the case of the apparent ki value for amp the half maximal inhibition of _PROTEIN_ transport was observed at even higher concentrations . apparent km _PROTEIN_ and ki values of recombinant _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ for various metabolites as a first step to elucidate the role of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in planta their _PROTEIN_ patterns were investigated by searching the publicly available microarray databases using the arabidopsis _METHOD_ browser . both genes are ubiquitously _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis throughout all developmental stages . notably _PROTEIN_ is highly _PROTEIN_ in tissues where oxidation plays an important role such as flowers stamens pollen developing seeds and senescent leaves . in addition the arabidopsis coresponse database csb.db was searched for genes that are coexpressed with _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . most of the genes coexpressed with _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are part of the glyoxylate cycle and _PROTEIN_ processes known to be primarily associated with oxidation . importantly one of the highest ranking coexpressed genes for both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ is the long chain acyl coa synthetase _PROTEIN_ that plays an important role in the activation of fatty acids during seedling establishment . to elucidate the impact of peroxisomal _PROTEIN_ transporters in vivo t dna insertion lines for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were isolated from the publicly available collections . no abberant phenotype was observed under normal growth conditions in homozygous _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ plants . importantly compared with the wild type seedling development was not delayed in either of the homozygous insertion lines indicating that storage oil mobilization was not compromised . however in the _PROTEIN_ mutant the t dna is located in the last exon of the _PROTEIN_ gene leading to the _PROTEIN_ of a truncated transcript that encodes a protein lacking the last amino acids of the c terminus . we _PROTEIN_ recombinant _PROTEIN_ protein in the yeast knockout _PROTEIN_ as described above and found that the truncated transport protein retains modest protein mediated _PROTEIN_ uptake activity when reconstituted into liposomes . thus the arabidopsis t dna insertion line _PROTEIN_ does not represent a loss of function mutant although the t dna had inserted into an exon of the corresponding gene . to produce arabidopsis lines with impaired _PROTEIN_ import into _LOCATION_ mediated by _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ plants repressing the _PROTEIN_ of both transporter genes were generated using an rnai approach with an ethanol inducible promoter alca . a bp cdna fragment of _PROTEIN_ was introduced into an intron spliced hairpin rna construct . the selected cdna fragment of _PROTEIN_ is highly similar to the corresponding region of _PROTEIN_ thus enabling simultaneous silencing of both genes from a single construct . the ethanol inducible rnai construct _PROTEIN_ was introduced into arabidopsis plants by agrobacterium mediated transformation . several independent transgenic lines were obtained after kanamycin selection and integration of the t dna was confirmed by genomic pcr . after selfing plants of the generation were screened for homozygous lines by segregation analysis of the nptii resistance gene further propagated and named . to determine the degree of simultaneous repression of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mrna in these transgenic lines we assessed _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ steady state transcript levels using rt pcr . rna from independent lines grown in the presence or absence of ethanol was isolated from d old seedlings . a strong simultaneous suppression of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ was observed in two independent rnai lines after ethanol induction consistent with their high nucleotide sequence identity whereas the _PROTEIN_ of the third gene _GENE_ was not affected . the results obtained by rt pcr for lines and were independently verified by quantitative rt pcr using two biological replicates . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are and fold downregulated after ethanol induction in line when compared with empty vector control plants . an even stronger reduction of the relative pnc mrna amounts was observed in the second line . the relative transcript levels of both pnc genes showed a slight repression prior to induction when compared with control plants . citation described previously that growth on murashige and skoog _METHOD_ agar plates might trigger endogenous ethanol production by anaerobic fermentation due to low oxygen conditions . this could explain the slight _PROTEIN_ of target genes in lines prior to ethanol application relative to the control . importantly the transgenic lines showed growth defects only after ethanol induction in parallel with the strong simultaneous repression of both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ under these conditions . the role of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in oxidation during postgerminative growth was investigated by examining seedling establishment of homozygous plants . mutants defective in import activation _PROTEIN_ and degradation of fatty acids _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ are unable to mobilize seed storage oil and seedling growth is arrested . however the presence of an alternative _PROTEIN_ source such as sucrose can rescue the phenotype . in our study seeds of several independent lines were grown on agar plates containing ethanol under controlled growth conditions . to assess whether sucrose was required for seedling establishment the seeds were placed on media either with or without sucrose . a defect in seedling growth upon ethanol induction of rnai _PROTEIN_ was reproducibly observed in the absence of sucrose . growth and development were arrested in seedlings compared with control plants carrying the empty vector . in contrast with other known mutants that exhibit the sucrose dependent phenotype described above treated with ethanol did develop seedlings on plates with sucrose but grew significantly slower than the control plants . in the absence of the inducer ethanol the growth rates and phenotypes of were indistinguishable from the wild type . similarly dark grown hypocotyls of _PROTEIN_ rnai seedlings were much shorter than those of wild type or empty vector controls when grown in the absence of sucrose indicative of their inability to mobilize storage oil for hypocotyl elongation . sucrose increased the elongation of rnai hypocotyls but did not restore them to the same length as the wild type indicating other functions for _PROTEIN_ and in addition to storage oil mobilization . although some mutants in which oxidation is severely impaired exhibit a defect in germination germination efficiency was not affected in the repression lines as shown for the _PROTEIN_ and cts mutant . two independent lines line and line that showed a severe ethanol inducible phenotype were selected for further studies . in wild type plants tag stored in oil bodies is degraded via lipolysis and peroxisomal oxidation and converted to sucrose to fuel postgerminative seedling establishment . to examine whether the arrested seedling growth of the _PROTEIN_ rnai lines is linked to impaired lipid breakdown levels of fatty acids and acyl coa esters were measured in d old seedlings of two independent lines treated with ethanol and the presence of oil bodies in seedling tissues was investigated by microscopy . the total content of fatty acids was increased eightfold in d old seedlings compared with seedlings transformed with the empty vector . as shown in figure . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ fatty acids accumulated in the repression lines . in particular the content of eicosenoic acid _PROTEIN_ which is considered to be diagnostic of tag was to times higher in seedlings than in control plants . consistent with the accumulation of fatty acids a strong increase in the quantity of long/very long chain acyl coa esters _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was observed in seedlings in comparison with the controls . in the absence of ethanol little difference in either the level of fatty acids or acyl coas was observed in seedlings compared with the empty vector control indicating that ethanol induced silencing of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ gene _PROTEIN_ causes the accumulation of fatty acids and acyl coa esters . examination of seedlings stained with the lipophilic dye nile red revealed that while oil bodies were largely absent in wild type hypocotyls d after germination the rnai seedlings exhibited a marked retention of oil bodies . taken together the retention of oil bodies and the accumulation of fatty acids and acyl coas indicate that both lipolysis and oxidation are impaired in seedlings . the requirement of peroxisomal _PROTEIN_ import for oxidation of compounds other than fatty acids was assessed by screening the response of _PROTEIN_ rnai lines to iba and db . in wild type plants both compounds are activated with coa in an _PROTEIN_ dependent manner and then converted by one cycle of oxidation to the active auxin indole acetic acid and the herbicide d respectively which severely inhibit root and hypocotyl growth . primary root elongation was analyzed in _PROTEIN_ rnai seedlings grown on agar plates supplemented with sucrose ethanol and either iba or db . as shown in figure the _PROTEIN_ rnai seedlings exhibited a moderate level of resistance to iba and db compared with wild type seedlings and empty vector controls . we also investigated auxin responses of dark grown hypocotyls from seedlings of two _PROTEIN_ rnai lines empty vector controls and the wild type . although hypocotyls are somewhat less sensitive to the application of exogenous auxins than roots both iba and db inhibited elongation of wild type and control hypocotyls . by contrast the hypocotyls of _PROTEIN_ rnai seedlings exhibited resistance to these compounds consistent with a block in their oxidation . these results indicate that the activation of iba and db is dependent on peroxisomal _PROTEIN_ import catalyzed by _PROTEIN_ .
