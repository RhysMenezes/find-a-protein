ubiquitin ligase plays a fundamental role in regulating multiple cellular events in eukaryotes by fine tuning the stability and activity of specific target proteins . we have previously shown that ubiquitin ligase _PROTEIN_ regulates plant growth in response to nutrient balance between _PROTEIN_ and nitrogen in arabidopsis . subsequent study demonstrated that _PROTEIN_ targets proteins for ubiquitination and modulates the protein abundance in response to c/n nutrient status . however the underlying mechanism for the targeting of _PROTEIN_ to proteins remains unclear . here we show that _PROTEIN_ interacts with proteins in a phosphorylation dependent manner . we identified and as putative binding sites on _PROTEIN_ by motif analysis . mutation of these ser/thr residues to ala in _PROTEIN_ inhibited the interaction with proteins as demonstrated by yeast two hybrid and co immunoprecipitation analyses . additionally we identified in vivo phosphorylation of and on _PROTEIN_ by _METHOD_ analysis . a peptide competition assay showed that the application of synthetic phospho peptide but not the corresponding unphosphorylated peptide suppresses the interaction between _PROTEIN_ and proteins . moreover arabidopsis plants overexpressing mutated _PROTEIN_ which could not bind to proteins showed accumulation of proteins and growth arrest in disrupted c/n nutrient conditions similar to wild type plants although overexpression of intact _PROTEIN_ resulted in repression of accumulation and tolerance to the conditions . together these results demonstrate that the physiological role of phosphorylation at binding sites on _PROTEIN_ is to modulate the binding ability and stability of proteins to control plant c/n nutrient response .
in arabidopsis proteins consist of _METHOD_ and each isoform can be separated into two major evolutionary branches the group and the non group . each isoform has a different binding affinity to the client proteins . previously we have shown that belonging to the non group is directly associated and ubiquitinated by _PROTEIN_ . in addition to immunoprecipitation and _METHOD_ analysis revealed that several _METHOD_ are putative targets of _PROTEIN_ with the stability of each isoform being different in response to c/n nutrient conditions . to evaluate the specificity of the interaction between _PROTEIN_ and each isoform we carried out yeast two hybrid analysis . among _METHOD_ and were chosen as representative of the non group whereas and were chosen as representative of the group . because the c terminal region of _PROTEIN_ was shown to interact with in analysis we constructed the c terminal region of _PROTEIN_ fused to the lexa dna binding domain _PROTEIN_ and the full length of or fused to the activation domain . the constructs were co transformed into yeast cells and the interactions were evaluated by galactosidase activity in a liquid assay using o nitrophenyl d galactoside . yeast cells harboring and showed high galactosidase activity whereas and had low activity . all ad proteins were _PROTEIN_ in yeast and the _PROTEIN_ levels did not correlate with galactosidase activity . the showed higher activity than that of although the _PROTEIN_ protein amount was lower . these results indicate that has a higher binding affinity to _PROTEIN_ compared with the . thus the was chosen for further study . to further confirm the requirements of the c terminal region of _PROTEIN_ binding to we generated the truncated _METHOD_ of _PROTEIN_ and tested the interaction with . truncation of the c terminal region of _PROTEIN_ abolished the interaction with in . this result was also confirmed by co immunoprecipitation analysis following transient _PROTEIN_ in n. benthamiana leaves . myc tagged was co immunoprecipitated with _PROTEIN_ tagged _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ which has no ubiquitin ligase activity but not with the c terminal region deletion mutant _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . these results demonstrate that proteins bind to the c terminal region but not to other regions of _PROTEIN_ . we therefore utilized _PROTEIN_ for interaction analysis avoiding the possible degradation of the proteins that interact with _PROTEIN_ . previously we have shown that _PROTEIN_ is localized at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and the localization is essential for the regulation of c/n nutrient response . this finding suggests that _PROTEIN_ interacts with proteins and regulates their stability at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . to test this possibility we explored the distribution of _PROTEIN_ and complex in plant cells . first _PROTEIN_ fused to _METHOD_ at the c terminus _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and fused to mcherry at the n terminus were transiently co _PROTEIN_ in n. benthamiana leaf epidermal cells for co localization analysis . the _METHOD_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was observed in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ as shown in a previous study . by contrast the _METHOD_ of mcherry was observed at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ as well as in the cytoplasm and _LOCATION_ . the _METHOD_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ overlapped with mcherry at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ indicating that _PROTEIN_ and were co localized at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . next we performed bifc analysis to evaluate the direct interaction between _PROTEIN_ and at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . the n or c terminal parts of _METHOD_ were fused to _PROTEIN_ and respectively _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . the constructs were transiently co _PROTEIN_ in n. benthamiana leaf epidermal cells with _PROTEIN_ mcherry used as a transformation and _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ marker . as a result reconstituted _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was observed at the cell surface when _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ were co _PROTEIN_ whereas co _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ with a no fusion _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ with a no fusion _METHOD_ yielded no _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . the _METHOD_ of _PROTEIN_ mcherry was observed in all combinations and completely overlapped with the reconstituted _METHOD_ . together these results clearly demonstrate that _PROTEIN_ interacts with proteins at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ in plant cells . proteins form a homo or heterodimer with the n terminal region and are able to simultaneously bind to two distinct sites of a single target protein or two different target proteins . each monomer contains a conserved amphipathic groove that mediates the association of proteins with phosphoserine or threonine containing motifs on their client proteins . to test whether the dimerization and the conserved amphipathic groove are involved in the interaction with _PROTEIN_ we constructed mutated _METHOD_ of in which the n terminal region was deleted to inhibit dimer formation . alternatively a conserved lys residue in the amphipathic groove was substituted by glu to abolish the ability to bind to the phosphopeptide . in analysis the mutation did not affect the interaction with _PROTEIN_ whereas the mutation significantly inhibited it . to further examine these results in plant cells we carried out co ip analysis . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was transiently co _PROTEIN_ with the native or mutated _METHOD_ of myc in n. benthamiana leaves and then subjected to co ip and western blotting analysis . the was co immunoprecipitated with _PROTEIN_ indicating that proteins can interact with _PROTEIN_ as monomers . the interaction between _PROTEIN_ and was only partially inhibited by the mutation which was inconsistent with the results of analysis that showed no interaction . it is possible that arabidopsis could not interact with _PROTEIN_ but rather with the endogenous _METHOD_ of n. benthamiana which can form a heterodimer with arabidopsis protein and in turn mediate the interaction with _PROTEIN_ . to evaluate this possibility we used the protein with both n terminal deletion and lys substitution a protein that showed a marked reduction in binding activity . these results indicate that the conserved lys residue in the amphipathic groove of proteins is essential for the binding to _PROTEIN_ . proteins are known to be mostly associated with two types of phosphopeptides rsx xp or rsxx xp in which the phospho ser/thr residue is required for binding . scansite analysis of the c terminal region of the _PROTEIN_ amino acid sequence revealed four putative binding sites corresponding to the mode i binding motif . among these sites showed the highest score . these sites except for were conserved in _PROTEIN_ the most closely related homologue to _PROTEIN_ but not in _PROTEIN_ . analysis revealed that _PROTEIN_ also interacts with whereas _PROTEIN_ did not show any interaction suggesting that and residues in the c terminal region of _PROTEIN_ may be involved in the interaction with proteins . to examine whether these residues on _PROTEIN_ are involved in the interaction with proteins we introduced a single or multiple alanine substitution of _PROTEIN_ at and . in analysis galactosidase activity was reduced by a single alanine substitution at one of four residues compared with the native form . substitution showed the greatest reduction . moreover the galactosidase activity was significantly reduced by a quadruple alanine substitution _PROTEIN_ . similar results were also demonstrated by co ip and western blotting analysis with n. benthamiana leaves . the amount of co immunoprecipitated was dramatically _PROTEIN_ by single substitution and triple substitution containing . on the contrary triple substitution except for did not have an obvious effect on the interaction nor did a single substitution except for . _PROTEIN_ did not show the interaction with suggesting that these residues are involved in the interaction with proteins and especially plays the central role for binding among the four residues . to evaluate these results in arabidopsis we prepared arabidopsis cultured cells constitutively _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and tested the interaction with endogenous proteins . co ip and western blotting analysis demonstrated that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is not able to interact with endogenous proteins whereas intact _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ did interact . taken together we conclude that and residues on _PROTEIN_ are essential for the interaction with proteins . as shown in fig . the conserved amphipathic groove of is required for the interaction with _PROTEIN_ suggesting that proteins bind to _PROTEIN_ in a phosphorylation dependent manner . to evaluate this possibility we first identified the in vivo phosphorylation sites of the _PROTEIN_ protein by _METHOD_ _METHOD_ analysis . liquid chromatography tandem _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ analysis with immunoprecipitated _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ from transgenic arabidopsis cultured cells identified phosphorylation on and both of which are considered putative phosphorylation residues for the binding sites on _PROTEIN_ . to further examine the phosphorylation we generated the phospho specific antibody antibody raised against the thr peptide _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and detected phosphorylation on the residue in vivo . immunoprecipitated _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was detected by anti thr antibody whereas _PROTEIN_ substituted with ala at _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was not detected . together these results demonstrate that binding sites on _PROTEIN_ are phosphorylated in vivo . to evaluate the effect of _PROTEIN_ phosphorylation on interaction with proteins we performed an in vitro _PROTEIN_ phosphorylation assay followed by far western blotting with recombinant his and anti his antibody . recently we have identified the kinase targeted to _PROTEIN_ using a proteomics approach . thus we used kta as the kinase for the in vitro phosphorylation assay against _PROTEIN_ . the n terminal hydrophobic region of _PROTEIN_ was deleted for sufficient _PROTEIN_ in e. coli and the remaining residues were fused to mbp to generate recombinant mbp _PROTEIN_ fusion protein _PROTEIN_ . mbp _PROTEIN_ was incubated with _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ kta in the reaction buffer for min . after the reaction the phosphorylation of mbp _PROTEIN_ was assessed by a phos tag mobility shift assay in which binding of phosphoproteins to the phos tag reagent in the _PROTEIN_ polyacrylamide gel _PROTEIN_ slows down their mobility . western blotting with anti mbp antibody demonstrated that mbp _PROTEIN_ incubated with _PROTEIN_ kta but not with _PROTEIN_ shows slow migration indicating that _PROTEIN_ is phosphorylated by kta in vitro . furthermore western blotting analysis with anti thr antibody revealed that kta phosphorylates at _PROTEIN_ . far western blotting analysis clearly demonstrated that only the phosphorylated mbp _PROTEIN_ can be associated with his . together these results indicate that the phosphorylation of _PROTEIN_ is required for the interaction with proteins . to determine whether phosphorylation of the binding sites on _PROTEIN_ is critical for the interaction we performed a competitive binding assay using the synthetic peptides thr and . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and myc were transiently co _PROTEIN_ in n. benthamiana leaves and the extracts were immunoprecipitated with anti _PROTEIN_ beads in the presence of thr or peptide . in the presence of thr peptide co immunoprecipitated myc was _PROTEIN_ to some extent and the dissociated myc was recovered in the supernatant fraction from the precipitation whereas peptide did not affect the interaction . these results clearly demonstrate that the interaction of _PROTEIN_ with proteins is mediated by the phosphorylation of the binding sites on _PROTEIN_ . to examine the physiological requirements of phosphorylation at binding sites for _PROTEIN_ function the c/n nutrient response of transgenic arabidopsis overexpressing intact _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or quadruple substituted _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was analyzed . wild type and transgenic plants were grown on modified murashige and skoog medium under the indicated _PROTEIN_ and nitrogen conditions and the percentage of day old seedlings with expanded green cotyledons was scored . all seedlings exhibited expanded green cotyledons under balanced c/n nutrient conditions _PROTEIN_ . in disrupted c/n nutrient conditions _PROTEIN_ wt seedlings exhibited a strong purple pigmentation and the percentage of cotyledon greening _PROTEIN_ significantly . on the other hand _PROTEIN_ was less sensitive to the disruption of c/n nutrient conditions and showed an increase in the percentage of cotyledon greening compared with the wt . however the percentage of cotyledon greening in all three independent lines for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ to a similar level as observed in the wt under disrupted c/n nutrient conditions indicating the physiological importance of these binding sites for _PROTEIN_ function in plant c/n nutrient response . previously we demonstrated that _PROTEIN_ ubiquitinates and promotes the proteasomal degradation of a specific isoform . furthermore we have shown that endogenous proteins as well as constitutively _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ accumulate under disrupted c/n nutrient conditions an accumulation enhanced in _PROTEIN_ double knock out mutants . thus we concluded that _PROTEIN_ negatively regulates the accumulation of proteins . to examine the requirement of _PROTEIN_ phosphorylation for the regulation of protein accumulation in response to c/n nutrient conditions we analyzed the amount of proteins in plants for wt _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ by western blotting using the anti antibody . proteins in the wt were more accumulated under disrupted c/n nutrient conditions compared with balanced c/n nutrient conditions as reported previously whereas the accumulation was repressed in _PROTEIN_ . interestingly such repression in _PROTEIN_ was released in _PROTEIN_ and restored to similar levels as in the wt . we also analyzed the transcriptional level of genes used in the interaction analysis with _PROTEIN_ . because we could not detect _PROTEIN_ we selected which is located in the same subgroup as . although the transcriptional level of some genes was changed in these plants in different c/n nutrient conditions there was no correlation between mrna levels and protein levels . together these results clearly demonstrate that the binding of proteins to the ser/thr residues in the c terminus of _PROTEIN_ is essential for the mediation of c/n nutrient response via protein stability in plants .
