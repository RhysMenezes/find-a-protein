chloroplasts are descendents of a cyanobacterial endosymbiont but many chloroplast protein genes of endosymbiont origin are encoded by the _LOCATION_ . the chloroplast cyanobacteria relationship is a typical target of orthogenomics an analytical method that focuses on the relationship of orthologous genes . here we present results of a pilot study of functional orthogenomics combining bioinformatic and experimental analyses to identify _LOCATION_ encoded chloroplast proteins of endosymbiont origin . phylogenetic profiling based on complete clustering of all proteins in _METHOD_ including eight cyanobacteria and two photosynthetic eukaryotes was used to deduce protein groups that are conserved in all oxygenic autotrophs analyzed but not in non oxygenic _METHOD_ . with the exception of well characterized protein groups arabidopsis proteins and synechocystis proteins in the conserved homolog groups were analyzed . green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ targeting experiments indicated that arabidopsis proteins were targeted to _LOCATION_ . _PROTEIN_ of arabidopsis genes was promoted by light . among the disruptants of synechocystis showed phenotypes related to photosynthesis . arabidopsis mutants in groups including those reported previously showed phenotypes . characteristics of pulse amplitude modulation _METHOD_ were markedly different in corresponding mutants of arabidopsis and synechocystis in most cases . we conclude that phylogenetic profiling is useful in finding cprendos but the physiological functions of orthologous genes may be different in chloroplasts and cyanobacteria .
an all against all blastp search was performed on a data set comprising all predicted proteins in _METHOD_ including eight cyanobacteria three photosynthetic bacteria two non photosynthetic bacteria two non photosynthetic eukaryotes and two photosynthetic eukaryotes . the genomes used in the analysis are listed in supplementary table . homolog groups were constructed by single linkage clustering with several different threshold e values using the gclust software version . the method of clustering was briefly described in previous publications . we used the results of clustering with e values and . the homolog groups that are shared by all of the eight cyanobacteria and the two photosynthetic eukaryotes but not by other _METHOD_ were selected for each e value and the groups were combined . we thus obtained homolog groups that were specific for photosynthetic _METHOD_ . this clustering was done using all the proteins coded for by the _LOCATION_ genome as well as organellar genomes and therefore some groups contained _LOCATION_ encoded proteins and cyanobacterial proteins such as photosynthetic reaction center proteins _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . however other groups contained _LOCATION_ encoded proteins of the plant and the alga with cyanobacterial homologs . among the selected groups groups contained known proteins involved in photosynthesis or chloroplast biogenesis . finally homolog groups in which the proteins in a. thaliana and c. merolae are encoded by the _LOCATION_ and have not been assigned a well defined function were selected as targets for further functional analysis . these homolog groups included a. thaliana proteins and synechocystis proteins . each of the homologous protein groups was assigned a cpre number . an alignment of an example homolog group is shown in fig . . in this example the member proteins were highly similar to one another but each of the proteins of a. thaliana and c. merolae had an n terminal extension . among the a. thaliana sequences had an n terminal extension . three _METHOD_ were tested for the prediction of intracellular localization . with the exception of seven proteins most of the proteins were predicted to be localized in chloroplasts by at least two prediction _METHOD_ . note that these results were obtained with the most recent software . only an old version of targetp was available at the start of the present study . based on these results we considered these proteins as putative cprendos and analyzed protein targeting and light regulated gene _PROTEIN_ . intracellular targeting of these a. thaliana proteins was analyzed using green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ fusion proteins in onion epidermis with particle bombardment . this is a heterologous system however we obtained no unexpected results that contradicted previously reported biochemical or immunological data in arabidopsis or cyanidioschyzon proteins . of the proteins analyzed proteins were targeted to _LOCATION_ . seven of these were also targeted to mitochondria . a complete set of _METHOD_ micrographs is presented in supplementary fig . . two proteins in cpre consisting of four paralogs showed no clear localization and are possibly cytoplasmic proteins . note that these two cytoplasmic proteins are included in a different cluster in a recent database . the data were consistent with the proteomic studies on various chloroplast fractions namely proteins belonging to homolog groups among the examined groups have been detected in at least some fractions of chloroplast . it is known that the proteomics data alone should not be considered as conclusive evidence for the presence of these proteins in chloroplasts because many non chloroplast proteins have been detected in chloroplast fractions . the _METHOD_ data indicated that even the putative cprendos that were not predicted to be chloroplast proteins by targeting prediction or that had not been detected in chloroplasts by _METHOD_ _METHOD_ were indeed localized to chloroplasts . we conclude therefore that we identified cprendos . the transcript level of the genes encoding the proteins was also analyzed by rna gel blot analysis . the transcript level of genes was elevated in the light as compared with in the dark suggesting light promoted _PROTEIN_ of these genes . table summarizes the targeting and _PROTEIN_ analyses . among the candidate proteins showed both chloroplast localization and light promoted _PROTEIN_ . disruptants of the corresponding genes were prepared in synechocystis sp . pcc by homologous recombination using a kanamycin resistance cassette from . among the genes were knocked out while seven genes were not completely disrupted and are likely to be essential . constructs for three genes could not be made despite repeated attempts either because of experimental failure or due to sequence differences in the strain used . the kinetics of _METHOD_ induction were measured for all the mutants as an initial survey . the abbreviation fi in fig . indicates that the kinetics was different in the mutant . to analyze the kinetic properties of photosynthesis in more detail we performed pulse amplitude modulation _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ analysis on selected mutants . these included the mutants that showed some differences in the _METHOD_ kinetics and several apparently normal mutants . representative traces for the _PROTEIN_ analysis are shown in fig . . the maximal level of _METHOD_ was obtained by the addition of dcmu at the end of each measurement . a disruptant of showed significantly reduced while retaining f and fm values . a disruptant of showed an elevated level of f thus exhibiting very low fv/fm . traces from _PROTEIN_ analysis for all mutants analyzed are presented in supplementary fig . and the results are summarized in fig . . the mutants that showed normal _METHOD_ kinetics in the initial survey were not in principle analyzed by _PROTEIN_ . this was justified by the _PROTEIN_ that six such normal mutants were also normal in the _PROTEIN_ analysis . eleven mutants showed both increased qn and _PROTEIN_ . two others showed elevated qn while two others showed reduced . these mutants also showed other _METHOD_ in qp npq fv/fm or . these results suggested that the mutants had defects in photosynthetic electron transport or _METHOD_ . the results of oxygen evolution and spectral analysis are summarized in table . oxygen evolution activity was low in three mutants whereas seven mutants showed elevated evolution per chl . this must be due to a reduced content of chl most probably the antenna chl of psi . the ratio of carotenoid to chl and the ratio of _PROTEIN_ to chl as estimated from the absorbance ratio and respectively were also affected in mutants . it should be noted that the five mutants that did not show significant difference in _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ showed changes in the absorption spectrum . interestingly the seven mutants that have not been completely segregated did show phenotypes in _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ oxygen evolution or pigment composition . t dna insertion lines of a. thaliana that tagged the cpre genes were obtained from the arabidopsis information resource and analyzed . among the cpre groups we obtained data for groups while results on eight other mutants were reported during the course of the present study . mutants were not obtained for seven cpres because no t dna insertion lines were available in the stock centers and only heterozygous lines were obtained for four cpres . mutants of a gene of had variegated cotyledons and foliage leaves . a mutant of had non green cotyledons on sucrose containing medium . _PROTEIN_ analysis showed that mutants of nine cpres had some defects in photosynthesis . representative traces for the _PROTEIN_ analysis are shown in fig . . in our current analysis out of cpres indeed showed phenotypes that were considered as being related to photosynthesis . this project began years ago and during this time some of the proteins have been characterized in detail and the reports have been published . these are _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and . some other proteins were found to be homologs of proteins in other _METHOD_ such as nnru homolog vkor homolog clps homolog and yggh homolog . _PROTEIN_ was described as a gene involved in a light acclimation defect but biochemical analysis of the protein was not reported . _PROTEIN_ was described only as a transgene in yeast cells . other proteins that have ycf numbers or annotations have not been analyzed in plants to date . curiously mutants in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ did not show detectable phenotypes in synechocystis using the method of analysis and growth conditions in the study reported here . according to the publications on these proteins the mutants showed phenotypes at high light conditions . this suggests that more of the mutants that were analyzed in the present study may show phenotypes under high light or other extreme conditions .

end the putative targeting sequence with a short connecting sequence a at its end and a short connecting sequence b at its end and the _METHOD_ sequence with a short connecting sequence b at its end . the connecting sequences a and b were used to join two pcr fragments by pcr . for the amplification of fragments and the _METHOD_ vector was used as a template . the primers for the amplification of fragment were primer ccctcagaagaccagagggctattgagact and primer ggatcctctagagtcgac . the primers for the amplification of fragment were primer atggtgagcaagggcgag or gtgagcaagggcgaggag and primer
