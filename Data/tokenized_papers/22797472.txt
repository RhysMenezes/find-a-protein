a highly enriched fraction of the transcriptionally active chromosome from chloroplasts of spinach was analyzed by two dimensional gel electrophoresis and _METHOD_ _METHOD_ to identify proteins involved in structuring of the nucleoid core . among such _LOCATION_ nucleoid associated candidate proteins a kd swib domain containing protein was identified . it belongs to a subgroup of low molecular _METHOD_ swib domain proteins which in arabidopsis thaliana has six members with predictions for localization in the two dna containing organelles . green/red _METHOD_ protein fusions of four of them were shown to be targeted to chloroplasts where they colocalize with each other as well as with the _LOCATION_ envelope dna binding protein in structures corresponding to _LOCATION_ nucleoids . for swib and swib a second localization in mitochondria and _LOCATION_ respectively could be observed . swib has a histone motif next to the swib domain and was shown to bind to dna . moreover the recombinant swib protein was shown to induce compaction and condensation of nucleoids and to functionally complement a mutant of escherichia coli lacking the histone like nucleoid structuring protein h ns .
to identify novel proteins involved in shaping of chloroplast nucleoids a highly enriched fraction of the tac from spinach chloroplasts was used for proteome analysis . for our studies we used chloroplasts isolated from spinach leaves which provide excellent material for biochemical studies requiring highly purified and functional organelles that can not easily be prepared from arabidopsis . to obtain a highly enriched fraction a conventional tac fraction prepared from kg of spinach leaves was subjected to a second round of gel filtration resulting in tac ii . the protein compositions of both fractions were analyzed by two dimensional gel electrophoresis . for isoelectric focusing ph gradients from to were chosen . after second dimension denaturing gel electrophoresis proteins were visualized by staining with _METHOD_ blue . image analysis allowed the detection of spots on the de gel of tac i whereas on the de gel of tac ii only protein spots were clearly discernible . these proteins were manually excised from the gel and digested with trypsin . by means of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ tac ii proteins with protein scores of or more and individual peptide scores of or more could be identified . thirteen of them were identified by homology with protein sequences of spinach by homologies with protein sequences from arabidopsis and by homology with sequences from rice and single proteins were identified by homologies with other plant species . despite precipitation with protamine sulfate and the second round of gel filtration used for preparation of tac ii the fraction contains several contaminants as it has previously been reported for other preparations enriched in nucleoid associated proteins . for example the two polygalacturonases are likely contaminants . these proteins are synthesized as precursors at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ from where they are transported in vesicles to their destinations in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and cell wall . it is likely that these proteins in the tac fraction are derived from the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ which is known to be physically tightly associated with chloroplast envelope _LOCATION_ . among the identified proteins in tac ii are several putative nucleoid core components with putative roles in transcription replication _PROTEIN_ and structuring of dna . as expected subunits of the _LOCATION_ encoded rna polymerase namely _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were detected in tac ii . the _PROTEIN_ subunit was identified with a score under and therefore was not included in supplemental data set online . six of the identified tac proteins are putative architectural ptnaps with dna binding properties that are able to alter the dna compaction through bending wrapping or bridging . previous biochemical investigations revealed low molecular _METHOD_ dna binding proteins in nucleoid fractions which were assigned as candidates for functional replacement of the missing hu like proteins in plants . hitherto an identification of such basic low molecular _METHOD_ proteins was not possible . purification of the tac fraction from spinach chloroplasts enabled the identification of a swib domain protein in spot of the de gel . the peptide _METHOD_ determined for the spinach protein matched with a kd swib domain containing protein encoded by the _GENE_ gene . the low molecular _METHOD_ swib domain protein was found to have a high lys content and a high isoelectric point thereby resembling bacterial _PROTEIN_ . the smallest putative ptnap identified in spot belongs to the family of swib domain proteins that has members in arabidopsis as identified by the arabidopsis information resource database analyses . phylogenetic analysis with software revealed that based on their amino acid sequences plant swib proteins can be subdivided into four major groups . the two group proteins with a molecular _METHOD_ of kd have high similarity with the yeast _PROTEIN_ protein which is a component of the swi/snf complex with a functional role in transcriptional activation by modulation of the chromatin structure . proteins of groups and have in addition to the swib domain other domains such as really interesting new gene zinc finger plus and gyf or the dek domain . all members of these two groups are predicted to be involved in histone modification and regulation of transcription in the _LOCATION_ . the kd swib domain protein found in tac ii belongs to group consisting of so called stand alone swib domain proteins where the swib domain is found as an isolated protein and is not part of a larger protein . in prokaryotes such swib domain proteins were found exclusively in chlamydia which as parasitic bacteria probably have acquired the swib domain gene from a mammalian host . the other tac ii proteins possessing dna binding domains have molecular _METHOD_ higher than kd . the protein identified in spot is a member of the _PROTEIN_ subfamily of the _PROTEIN_ family of transcription _PROTEIN_ unique to plants . the _PROTEIN_ domain consists of to amino acids and is involved in binding to dna . in silico analyses predicted localization for some members of the _PROTEIN_ subfamily in organelles . moreover for the _GENE_ protein a dual targeting to chloroplasts and _LOCATION_ could be shown . the protein identified in spot represents a structural _PROTEIN_ of chromosomes protein . smc proteins belong to a ubiquitous protein family present in almost all prokaryotic and eukaryotic _METHOD_ and have functions in chromosome condensation segregation cohesion and dna recombination and repair . in e. coli smc proteins were shown to induce negative supercoiling of dna in vivo indicating their involvement in organization and compaction of nucleoids . an smc _PROTEIN_ as well as an catenin protein were previously identified in the proteome of chloroplasts from arabidopsis . the protein identified in spot has similarity in sequence with the arabidopsis catenin protein . armadillo repeat proteins form a large group of proteins in arabidopsis . two further putative ptnaps identified in tac ii belong to the family of the myb/sant domain transcription _PROTEIN_ having a helix turn helix _PROTEIN_ dna binding domain . animal and fungal proteins containing sant domains _PROTEIN_ were found to be associated with histone modifying enzymes and _PROTEIN_ dependent chromatin remodeling proteins . proteome analysis of tac ii allowed identification of a kd swib domain protein . _METHOD_ of peptides obtained by trypsin digestion fitted best to the kd swib protein which has the lowest molecular _METHOD_ of the six members of group . all swib proteins designated to this group are predicted to be targeted to either chloroplasts or mitochondria . to investigate the subcellular localization of the proteins _METHOD_ fusion constructs were prepared and employed for transient transformation assays with tobacco protoplasts . microscopy inspections revealed that apart from swib which was observed in the cytoplasm when fused to _METHOD_ _METHOD_ fusion proteins of all group swibs were targeted to chloroplasts to mitochondria or to both organelles . all _METHOD_ chimeric proteins located in chloroplasts showed punctuate patterns resembling the distribution of nucleoids visualized by the pend _METHOD_ construct on the red background of the chlorophyll _METHOD_ . the mitochondrial localization of swib _METHOD_ and swib _METHOD_ proteins could be confirmed by labeling with mitotracker orange . as a control a construct encoding _METHOD_ alone is shown . to investigate whether the four chloroplast located swib domain proteins might be components of the same subplastidial structures their potential colocalization was examined by simultaneous transformation of protoplasts with _METHOD_ and red _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ fusion constructs . microscopy analyses showed that swib _METHOD_ colocalized with swib _METHOD_ swib _METHOD_ with swib _METHOD_ and swib _METHOD_ with swib _METHOD_ . in all four _METHOD_ combinations tested _METHOD_ signals frequently overlapped indicating an association of all four swib proteins with the same subplastidial structures . to examine whether these structures could represent nucleoids swib _METHOD_ and swib _METHOD_ constructs were transiently cotransformed with a pend dsred construct in tobacco protoplasts . the pend protein is known to bind to _LOCATION_ dna and to be suited for visualization of _LOCATION_ nucleoids . the overlay of green and red _METHOD_ signals within the chloroplasts revealed that both swib and swib colocalize with the pend protein . the amino acid sequences of the four swib domain proteins targeted to chloroplast nucleoids have high similarity due to the highly conserved swib domain . one of the _METHOD_ determined by _METHOD_ _METHOD_ belongs to a theoretical peptide derived from the swib domain of swib as revealed by theoretical digestion with trypsin using the program expasy . _METHOD_ of five further peptides could correspond to peptides obtained by partial digestion of swib or to modified peptides . when the theoretical _METHOD_ of peptides obtained by digestion with trypsin from the four different proteins were compared it became obvious that swib and swib are very similar sharing four identical peptides with _METHOD_ above d. swib and swib were found to share two identical peptides with _METHOD_ above d but not to share peptides with swib and swib . besides the swib domain swib and have low compositional complexity regions _PROTEIN_ in their sequences . so far no universal function for such _PROTEIN_ could be elucidated . the _PROTEIN_ region at the n terminus of the swib protein shows high similarity to a part of the c terminal domain of the histone of tobacco . moreover in silico analysis revealed that this region of swib which is extremely rich in lys is highly similar to an analogous region found at the n terminus of the _PROTEIN_ protein from tobacco that was described to function as a dna binding domain . this part of the swib protein might represent a domain for binding to dna . no such motifs could be found in the sequences of swib and respectively . for immunological analyses the peptide sequence _PROTEIN_ representing the residues to of swib was chosen for production of a swib specific antibody . protein fractions derived from spinach chloroplasts and subfractions thereof were analyzed by immunoblotting . the predominant form of the protein in chloroplasts had a molecular _METHOD_ of kd which is consistent with the molecular _METHOD_ of the processed form of the in vitro translation product imported into chloroplasts . a second higher molecular _METHOD_ form of the protein could result from posttranslational modification . two _LOCATION_ and two higher molecular _METHOD_ _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ of the swib protein also could be detected in protein fractions isolated from chloroplasts and _LOCATION_ of arabidopsis leaves . we further tested the presence of swib in tac i and tac ii . when tac i and tac ii fractions having the same amount of protein were analyzed the level of immunoreactive protein detected by the swib antibody was higher in tac ii than in tac i indicating an enrichment of the swib protein during purification of tac . in comparison the relative level of the nucleoid associated protein _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ during purification of tac i as shown previously with corresponding fractions from barley chloroplasts . swib binds to dna when it is not altered by posttranslational modification because tac fractions contained only the lower molecular _METHOD_ form of swib . next we examined whether swib in tac ii binds to dna . for this purpose tac ii proteins after transfer onto nitrocellulose _LOCATION_ were renatured . by incubation with a radiolabeled rdna probe three low molecular _METHOD_ protein bands were detected . when the _LOCATION_ prior to incubation with dna was incubated with the swib antibody the intensity of the band corresponding to a dna binding protein of kd was diminished . this result indicates that swib might represent one of the low molecular _METHOD_ dna binding proteins of tac fractions detected previously . to investigate whether swib might have an architectural function in nucleoids we overexpressed the gene encoding swib in e. coli . dna staining with diamidino phenylindole showed that after induction with isopropyl d thiogalactopyranoside cells accumulating the recombinant swib protein had highly condensed nucleoids while control cells showed a uniform distribution of dna . accumulation of swib coincided with growth arrest of the cells for several hours shortly after addition of iptg . a similar effect on growth of e. coli cells and compaction of nucleoids had been observed previously when the abundant histone like protein h ns was overproduced . to investigate whether swib could be a functional analog of an abundant histone like protein termed h ns we aimed at complementation of an e. coli mutant lacking this _PROTEIN_ . the h ns protein was shown to induce compaction of nucleoids and to affect _PROTEIN_ of of the e. coli genes . among the genes repressed by h ns is the cryptic _PROTEIN_ operon which encodes all gene products necessary for uptake and fermentation of the aryl d _PROTEIN_ such as salicin or arbutin . mutant cells that can metabolize salicin appear as red colonies on salicin containing indicator plates whereas colonies unable to ferment salicin are colorless . to test whether the arabidopsis swib gene can functionally substitute for the e. coli hns gene cells of the mutant strain were transformed with the plasmid containing swib . after d of growth on indicator plates colonies of the hns mutant and the hns mutant transformed with plasmid were red whereas colonies of the mutant strain transformed with a control swib plasmid stayed colorless as colonies of the wild type . this result showed that swib in vivo can functionally replace the e. coli h ns protein . the t dna insertion mutants so far available have insertions either in untranslated region or in the intron of the swib gene . the fold to fivefold enhanced transcript levels in some of the mutants were found to coincide with retarded postgermination development of seedlings .
