phytochromes are light responsive photoreceptors in plants that influence development and differentiation during the entire plant life cycle . plant nucleoside diphosphate kinase _PROTEIN_ has been reported to be a component of the light mediated signalling cascade and to interact physically with phytochrome a in the _LOCATION_ . by using diverse methods as in vitro imports in vivo localisation of _METHOD_ fusion proteins and immuno blotting of plant cell fractions we clearly localise _PROTEIN_ only to chloroplasts but not to the _LOCATION_ demonstrating that although high affinity protein protein interactions can occur in vitro their physiological relevance can be artificial if the proteins are localised to different cell compartments in vivo .
computational transit peptide prediction reveals the presence of a probable chloroplast targeting sequence at the n terminus of _PROTEIN_ . when we fused _METHOD_ to the _PROTEIN_ end of which did not mask the transit peptide the chimera localised exclusively to arabidopsis chloroplasts . removing the predicted transit peptide resulted in a diffuse distribution in the _LOCATION_ as was the case with _METHOD_ . to corroborate the results from the in vivo localisation of the _METHOD_ fusion proteins we conducted in vitro import experiments with radioactively labelled precursor proteins into isolated arabidopsis chloroplasts . the translation product was efficiently translocated into chloroplasts and processed to the mature form of about kda . the processed form was resistant to treatment with the externally added protease thermolysin which removes proteins at the _LOCATION_ surface . this _METHOD_ that the predicted chloroplast transit peptide is functional and directs _PROTEIN_ efficiently to the organelle . there was still the possibility that the _PROTEIN_ gene is alternatively spliced with one translation product being targeted to chloroplasts whereas the other might end up in the _LOCATION_ . to investigate this we performed rt and _PROTEIN_ pcr on arabidopsis rna . with both methods we detected only one form of rna that corresponded to the full length precursor mrna asserting the notion that only a single form of the protein exists which is transported into chloroplasts . to further test that _PROTEIN_ is not also localised to the _LOCATION_ by some unknown mechanism we immunoblotted leaf extract _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ and stromal extracts from arabidopsis with antibodies against ndpk ferredoxin oxidoreductase and sucrose phosphate synthase proteins for the chloroplast stroma and the _LOCATION_ respectively that served as subcellular markers . to check for eventual contamination with mitochondria we analysed chloroplasts mitochondria and the _LOCATION_ fraction with antibodies against mitochondrial vdac . no mitochondrial contamination could be detected . fnr was detected in the leaf extract and the stromal fraction as anticipated and a slight contamination of the _LOCATION_ fraction with stromal proteins is also detectable . the full length form of the sps was only detectable in leaf extract whereas in enriched _LOCATION_ only a proteolytic fragment can be seen . the ndpk antibody recognised two bands in the stroma as described previously for pea whereas a lower band corresponding to _PROTEIN_ was exclusively present in the _LOCATION_ . the lower stromal band is also recognised in the _LOCATION_ but not the upper one . to verify the identity of the stromal and _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ we used an _PROTEIN_ agarose affinity _PROTEIN_ to enrich _PROTEIN_ from stroma and leaf extract . purification of atndpk from arabidopsis stroma followed by _METHOD_ _METHOD_ yielded peptides corresponding to _PROTEIN_ only . no peptides of another isoform were found indicating that _PROTEIN_ is the only isoform located in the chloroplast stroma . binding of total soluble proteins from whole leaf extracts to _PROTEIN_ agarose resulted in four bands containing atndpk _METHOD_ . the upper band corresponding to the protein recognised by the ndpk antibody in the stromal fraction contained only _PROTEIN_ . the second band much less intense comprised and . the most prominent band immuno detected in the _LOCATION_ fraction consisted solely of as well as the very faint lowest band . to exclude that the faint band in fig . at kda represents unprocessed _PROTEIN_ we immuno analysed the _LOCATION_ fraction with antibodies against ndpk and included the area around kda . the antibodies failed to recognise any protein in this molecular range . this result clearly supports our conclusion that _PROTEIN_ is not found in the _LOCATION_ but exclusively within chloroplasts . since ndpk proteins are involved in nucleotide metabolism we speculated that _PROTEIN_ in chloroplasts might be associated with _LOCATION_ dna which is organised in nucleoids . to this extend we stained isolated protoplasts with dapi and analysed the localisation of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in parallel . the overlay of both pictures clearly shows that the signal obtained from _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ co localised with dapi stained nucleoids . to validate this further we investigated _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ localisation in comparison with the nucleoid marker protein _PROTEIN_ which was fused to _METHOD_ . again the overlay shows an unambiguous co localisation of _PROTEIN_ with nucleoids suggesting that _PROTEIN_ in _LOCATION_ might have a dual role in nucleotide homeostasis and gene regulation as was demonstrated in other _METHOD_ . to determine if the spatial proximity of _PROTEIN_ to _LOCATION_ nucleoids mirrors a direct interaction we purified nucleoids from arabidopsis chloroplasts and analysed the obtained fraction by immuno staining with antibodies against sir an enzyme that had been reported to bind to nucleoids fnr and ndpk . the purified nucleoids contain sir as expected but fnr and ndpk are only found in samples from the first two washing steps .
