chloroplasts are a significant site for reactive oxygen species production under illumination and thus possess a well organized antioxidant system involving ascorbate . ascorbate recycling occurs in different manners in this system including a dehydroascorbate reductase reaction . we herein investigated the physiological significance of _PROTEIN_ in photo oxidative stress tolerance in arabidopsis . _METHOD_ fused _PROTEIN_ protein was targeted to chloroplasts in arabidopsis leaves . a _PROTEIN_ knockout mutant exhibited sensitivity to high light _PROTEIN_ . under _PROTEIN_ the ascorbate redox states were similar in mutant and wild type plants while total ascorbate content was significantly lower in the mutant suggesting that _PROTEIN_ contributes at least to some extent to ascorbate recycling . activation of monodehydroascorbate reductase occurred in _PROTEIN_ mutant which might compensate for the lack of _PROTEIN_ . interestingly glutathione oxidation was consistently inhibited in _PROTEIN_ mutant . these findings indicate that _PROTEIN_ regulates both ascorbate and glutathione redox states to acclimate to _PROTEIN_ .
_PROTEIN_ has been suggested to be a chloroplastic isoform in arabidopsis because it has an n terminal extension sequence similar to a chloroplast targeting signal which is absent in _PROTEIN_ and .

consequence all _METHOD_ tested successfully predicted that _PROTEIN_ is a chloroplastic protein . this was supported by a previous proteome analysis using chloroplasts isolated from arabidopsis leaves . peltier jb cai y sun q et al . the oligomeric stromal proteome of arabidopsis thaliana chloroplasts . mol . cell . proteomics . . behrens c blume c senkler m et al . the protein complex proteome of chloroplasts in arabidopsis thaliana . j. proteomics . in order to confirm this in more detail cdna was cloned into the vector for the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion proteins . when the fusion proteins were transiently _PROTEIN_ in the leaves of week old wild type arabidopsis plants _METHOD_ _METHOD_ clearly overlapped with the red _METHOD_ derived from chloroplasts . in contrast the _METHOD_ protein alone was distributed in the _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ . these results demonstrate the chloroplastic localization of _PROTEIN_ . for reverse genetic approach a t dna insertion line _PROTEIN_ of this gene was obtained . a t dna insertion occurred in the third intron of the _PROTEIN_ gene . a semi quantitative rt pcr analysis revealed that the line was a null mutant . furthermore total dhar activity in _PROTEIN_ leaves was approximately in wild type leaves . in an attempt to understand the physiological significance of _PROTEIN_ in photo oxidative stress tolerance week old wild type and _PROTEIN_ plants were subjected to ehl at for h. as shown in fig . both plants suffered visible damage from this strong stress however _PROTEIN_ plants were more bleached than the wild type plants . we then examined the effects of _PROTEIN_ knockout on the redox states of ascorbate . before ehl irradiation the _PROTEIN_ mutation had no significant effect on the levels or redox states of ascorbate and . while the ehl exposure for h did not induce visible damage in both wild type and _PROTEIN_ this treatment enhanced ascorbate oxidation especially in the mutant . furthermore the lack of _PROTEIN_ inhibited the ehl induced accumulation of ascorbate . these findings suggested that chloroplastic dhar is required for photo protection through ascorbate recycling in plants under strong photo oxidative stress conditions . the ehl exposure easily induced visible damage on leaves under the present experimental conditions making it difficult to understand the cause and effect relationship between the ascorbate redox states and _PROTEIN_ phenotype . to obtain more detailed data we used _PROTEIN_ at photons in subsequent analyses therefore . we confirmed that _PROTEIN_ mutant had lower dhar activity even under _PROTEIN_ . no visible oxidative damage was observed in wild type and _PROTEIN_ when subjected to this stress for h . we evaluated oxidative stress damage in the mutant by measuring fv/fm the maximum quantum yield of photosystem ii . the parameter was _PROTEIN_ by _PROTEIN_ irradiation in wild type and _PROTEIN_ plants but was more prominent in the mutant at h . furthermore this _PROTEIN_ was accompanied by an increase in the levels of malondialdehyde a marker of lipid oxidation . these findings indicated that the _PROTEIN_ mutant was more sensitive to this _PROTEIN_ than wild type . although the _PROTEIN_ induced accumulation of ascorbate was slightly but significantly suppressed in the _PROTEIN_ mutant the loss of _PROTEIN_ had no detectable effect on the redox states of ascorbate under the stress conditions . at present we do not have any robust explanation for this discrepancy . one plausible explanation might be that the loss of _PROTEIN_ actually had an impact on the redox states of ascorbate within chloroplasts . we might not be able to detect the impact because of use of whole leaf cells for the ascorbate measurement . we also found that the _PROTEIN_ mutation actually facilitated an increase in total mdar activity under _PROTEIN_ . these findings suggest that _PROTEIN_ contributed at least to some extent to ascorbate recycling under _PROTEIN_ although the lack of _PROTEIN_ could be compensated by other _METHOD_ including mdar . as described above ascorbate is required for the xanthophyll cycle which is one of the important processes for light acclimation . we measured npq to indicate the activity of the cycle in wild type and _PROTEIN_ under _PROTEIN_ . however there was no significant difference in this parameter between genotypes before and after _PROTEIN_ . this result was probably because of the small difference in ascorbate content between wild type and _PROTEIN_ and suggested that _PROTEIN_ does not contribute to the induction of npq at least under our experimental conditions . since dhar catalyzes the reduction of dha using gsh as an electron donor it is possible that dhar contributes to redox regulation of glutathione through its oxidation . in spite of its negligible effect on ascorbate redox states the lack of _PROTEIN_ markedly affected the redox states of glutathione . even in the absence of _PROTEIN_ the redox states of glutathione were more reduced in _PROTEIN_ mutant plants than in wild type plants . furthermore redox states were _PROTEIN_ in response to _PROTEIN_ in wild type plants but this _PROTEIN_ was significantly mitigated in _PROTEIN_ mutant plants . no significant difference was observed in _PROTEIN_ activity between wild type and _PROTEIN_ mutant plants suggesting that the high reduction states of glutathione in the _PROTEIN_ mutant were not associated with _PROTEIN_ activity . these findings indicate that _PROTEIN_ strongly contributes to the glutathione oxidation event in illuminated leaves . furthermore the _PROTEIN_ mutation facilitated an increase in the total glutathione content under _PROTEIN_ . the accumulation of glutathione is a general marker of oxidative stress . we previously found that the lack of chloroplastic apx isoenzymes have the similar impact on glutathione levels under excess light
