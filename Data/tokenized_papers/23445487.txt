_LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ associated binding protein _PROTEIN_ of arabidopsis thaliana is a novel type protein that binds to the /calmodulin complex and phosphatidylinositol phosphates as well as free . although the _PROTEIN_ gene is predominantly _PROTEIN_ in root hair cells it remains unknown how _PROTEIN_ functions in root hair cells via binding to ligands . from biochemical analyses using purified _PROTEIN_ and its variants we found that the n terminal basic domain with amino acids is necessary and sufficient for binding to ptdinsps and the /calmodulin complex and that the residual domain of _PROTEIN_ binds to free . in mutant analysis a _PROTEIN_ knockdown line displayed longer root hairs than the wild type . to examine the function of each domain in root hair cells we over _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and its variants using the root hair cell specific expansin _PROTEIN_ promoter . transgenic lines over _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and exhibited abnormal branched and bulbous root hair cells while over _PROTEIN_ of the domain suppressed root hair emergence and elongation . the domain was necessary and sufficient for the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ localization of _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ . these results suggest that the domain of _PROTEIN_ negatively regulates root hair tip growth via processing and ptdinsp signals on the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ while the residual domain is involved in the _PROTEIN_ of cell expansion .
to determine the binding sites of _PROTEIN_ for ligands such as ptdinsps we characterized the biochemical properties of _PROTEIN_ using recombinant proteins . _PROTEIN_ possesses a polybasic region of residues at the n terminal domain that is rich in lysine residues . the region from the to residue is rich in proline glutamate valine and lysine residues . to characterize the biochemical properties of the n terminal domain of _PROTEIN_ we prepared two types of recombinant _PROTEIN_ normal _PROTEIN_ and n terminally truncated _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ and were tagged with a tag at their c termini _PROTEIN_ in escherichia coli cells and isolated from the soluble fraction of the cell lysate . highly purified preparations of the recombinant proteins were obtained by three step ni _PROTEIN_ column chromatography phenyl hydrophobic interaction and qae columns . the molecular size of was smaller than that of _PROTEIN_ on _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . in addition a peptide of the domain of _PROTEIN_ tagged with was synthesized and subjected to _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ to confirm the molecular size and purity . these proteins were used for further biochemical characterization . to examine the binding site of the _PROTEIN_ we performed a overlay assay . _LOCATION_ sheets blotted with _PROTEIN_ and were incubated with . _PROTEIN_ and but not gave a positive signal in a dose dependent manner even in the presence of mm and mm kcl . this indicates that binds to the cc region of _PROTEIN_ which lacks the domain under physiological conditions . the binding of negatively charged phospholipids such as ptdins to proteins may be mediated by short sequences enriched in basic residues as discussed previously . _PROTEIN_ possesses such a polybasic region in the n terminal domain . to examine its binding capacity to ptdinsps we performed in vitro lipid binding assays . _PROTEIN_ and were incubated with nitrocellulose _LOCATION_ sheets _PROTEIN_ which were spotted with a series of ptdinsps . the interaction of the proteins with lipids was detected using anti his tag antibodies . _PROTEIN_ preferentially bound to ptdins ptdins ptdins and ptdins . did not bind to these lipids . the peptide bound to and phosphatidic acid but not to less _PROTEIN_ lipids including phosphatidylcholine phosphatidylethanolamine or phosphatidylinositol . furthermore we assessed the ptdinsp binding capacity quantitatively using _PROTEIN_ array sheets . _PROTEIN_ interacted with ptdins ptdins ptdins and ptdins . showed no capacity for binding to ptdinsps although a background signal was observed for . strongly bound to all ptdinsps examined but not to ptdins . these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ binds to ptdinsps directly through the domain . bound to the ptdinsps more strongly than _PROTEIN_ even when applied at of the amount used for _PROTEIN_ . this is probably due to the difference in molecular size and/or _PROTEIN_ structure between _PROTEIN_ and . ptdinsps in the spot area of the _LOCATION_ may accept a larger number of the small peptides but not _PROTEIN_ . there is also the possibility that the cc region interferes with interaction of the domain with ptdinsps . to examine the cam binding domain of _PROTEIN_ we performed a pull down assay with cam agarose beads . recombinant proteins were incubated with cam agarose in the presence of or egta a chelator . the proteins associated with cam agarose were extracted subjected to _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and then detected by immunoblotting with antibodies against the tag to detect _PROTEIN_ . as shown in figure _PROTEIN_ bound to cam agarose in the presence of but not in the presence of egta . furthermore the peptide bound to cam agarose only in the presence of however did not . these results indicate that the domain is necessary and sufficient for binding to the /cam complex . the domain has a possible cam binding motif namely a domain in which hydrophobic residues are positioned at the and residues . in a helical wheel model three corresponding residues and _PROTEIN_ are located at both ends of the basic region which comprises lysine and arginine residues . the basic surface of the helical wheel may interact with negatively charged phosphate moieties on the inositol _PROTEIN_ by electrostatic bonding . to investigate physiological roles of the _PROTEIN_ gene we obtained a t dna tagging knockdown mutant _PROTEIN_ which contains a t dna insertion into the upstream of the _PROTEIN_ gene from the arabidopsis biological resource center and established a homozygous line with the t dna insertion . junction sequences between the t dna and genomic dna were determined revealing that the line contains the t dna insertion at bp upstream of the _PROTEIN_ translation start site . because the insertion mutation was thought not to affect the primary structure of the gene product but to affect the level of gene _PROTEIN_ we examined the _PROTEIN_ transcription level in the mutant seedlings by real time rt pcr and found that the level was approximately of the wild type . to assess the effect of knockdown of the gene we compared mutant root hairs with those of the wild type because the _PROTEIN_ promoter is specifically active in root hair cells . the mutant root hairs were found to be significantly longer on average than those of the wild type . plants heterozygous for the t dna insertion exhibited intermediate levels with _PROTEIN_ to both _PROTEIN_ transcript levels and root hair length between the wild type and the homozygous mutant . these results indicate that the _PROTEIN_ gene functions negatively and quantitatively in root hair elongation . mutant root hairs developed at a similar distance from the root tip to those of the wild type but the elongation rate of mutant root hairs was higher than that of the wild type especially in _PROTEIN_ stages of root hair development . except for root hair length mutant plants did not exhibit any visible phenotypes in roots or other organs . polybasic regions of the proteins have been proposed to play a role in their _LOCATION_ targeting through interactions with ptdinsps . to investigate how the domain is involved in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ localization of _PROTEIN_ we _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and its variants tagged with _METHOD_ in transgenic a. thaliana . in addition to _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ constructs we prepared a _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ construct to estimate the contribution of n myristoylation at _PROTEIN_ to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ localization . these constructs were _PROTEIN_ under the control of the _PROTEIN_ promoter which is specific to root hair cells . localization patterns of these _METHOD_ tagged proteins were observed in root hair cells at the bulge forming stage because they caused root hair phenotypes that may confuse estimation of their intracellular localization at _PROTEIN_ stages . at least eight independent lines for each construct were established and the same localization pattern of _METHOD_ tagged protein was observed in all established lines for each construct . the results are shown in figure . _METHOD_ of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ constructs was detected _PROTEIN_ in the cell peripheral region including the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . however _METHOD_ of the _METHOD_ construct was detected throughout the cytoplasmic space . for detailed localization of these proteins the tip regions of root hairs without apparent abnormalities were treated with a lipophilic _METHOD_ dye n phenyl hexatrienyl pyridinium dibromide for a sufficiently short period that the dye stained _PROTEIN_ the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . then _METHOD_ from _METHOD_ and was observed simultaneously . the overlaid images indicate that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ localize predominantly to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and that _METHOD_ localizes predominantly to the cytoplasm . therefore the domain is necessary and sufficient for association of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ with the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . _METHOD_ of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ construct was detected in both the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and the cytoplasm . this suggests that association of _PROTEIN_ with the _LOCATION_ is enhanced by interaction of the protein with the _LOCATION_ components in addition to n myristoylation . to investigate the physiological roles of _PROTEIN_ and its domains in root hair development in detail we used a reverse genetic approach by over _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and its variants in a root hair cell specific manner . four types of construct _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were _PROTEIN_ in transgenic a. thaliana under the control of the _PROTEIN_ promoter . at least six homozygous transgenic lines were established for each construct . the transcript levels of these transgenes were determined by real time rt pcr and found to be approximately fold higher than the level of the _PROTEIN_ transcript in wild type plants . in all the established transgenic plant lines _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and constructs root hairs with abnormal morphologies including branches and bulbous structures were frequently observed . to statistically assess the frequencies of root hairs with abnormal morphologies we counted total root hairs and those containing branched structures in wild type and transgenic roots _PROTEIN_ . the frequency of appearance of abnormal root hairs was significantly higher in all examined lines for each construct than in the wild type but the frequency did not significantly vary between the constructs nor was it correlated with the _PROTEIN_ level of each construct . however the construct conferred a different phenotype to the others . seedlings of eight of the ten obtained transgenic lines had shorter root hairs than wild type seedlings and those of the other two lines had no root hairs in the transit region of the root hypocotyl boundary where wild type seedlings form many root hairs . a statistical analysis revealed that root hair lengths of root hair containing lines were less than half of the wild type on average . the transcription level of the coding transgene in a hairless line was over twice that in root hair containing lines and suggesting that the severity of the phenotype caused by is correlated with its _PROTEIN_ level . moreover root hair containing lines exhibited single epidermal cells containing multiple bulges which were never observed in the wild type root epidermis under the conditions used in this study . transgenic lines containing the _METHOD_ tagged protein constructs _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ showed the same root hair phenotypes as caused by each corresponding construct without the _METHOD_ moiety . for all the constructs the intracellular localization patterns observed in the root hair cells at the bulge forming stage were sustained in root hairs at _PROTEIN_ stages . these _PROTEIN_ support the idea that addition of the _METHOD_ moiety had no influence on the molecular functions of _PROTEIN_ and its variants in root hair cells .
