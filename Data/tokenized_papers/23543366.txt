this work shows that overexpression of the _PROTEIN_ gene from arabidopsis enhanced the _PROTEIN_ of embryogenic competence and triggered organogenesis from some cells of the regenerated embryo like structures . agrobacterium mediated genetic transformation of cotton was described in the _PROTEIN_ but is still time consuming and largely genotype dependant due to poor regeneration . to help solve this bottleneck we over _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ gene a homeobox transcription _PROTEIN_ cloned in arabidopsis thaliana known to stimulate organogenesis and/or somatic embryogenesis in arabidopsis tissues cultured in vitro . the atwus gene alone and atwus gene fused to the _METHOD_ marker were compared to the _METHOD_ gene alone and to an empty construct used as a control . somatic embryogenesis was improved in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ calli as the percentage of explants giving rise to embryogenic tissues was significantly higher when _PROTEIN_ gene was over _PROTEIN_ than in the control . an interesting result was that _PROTEIN_ embryogenic lines evolved in green embryo like structures giving rise to ectopic organogenesis never observed in any of our previous transformation experiments . using our standard in vitro culture protocol the overexpression of atwus in tissues of a recalcitrant variety did not result in the production of regenerated plants . this achievement will still require the optimization of other non genetic _PROTEIN_ such as the balance of exogenous phytohormones . however our results suggest that targeted _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ gene is a promising strategy to improve gene transfer in recalcitrant cotton cultivars .
we have analyzed the effect of _PROTEIN_ overexpression during regeneration via somatic embryogenesis from the appearance of embryogenic tissues through the development of somatic embryos . atwus _PROTEIN_ tissues were compared to controls with _PROTEIN_ to developmental and morphological characteristics . figure summarizes the successive steps of the regeneration process for both control and atwus _PROTEIN_ calli . in six independent experiments each including explants per construct we observed a significant increase in the percentage of embryogenic lines in calli where _PROTEIN_ was overexpressed . atwus overexpressors yielded times more embryogenic lines than control _METHOD_ overexpressors . variability between experiments probably reflects the heterogeneity of the starting material . for example experiments and were done with a different seed batch than experiment . the positive effect of atwus overexpression was confirmed in another experiment where was used as the second control . this result shows that the _METHOD_ gene has no detrimental effect on somatic embryogenesis . the percentage of explants giving rise to embryogenic tissues was statistically higher when the fusion atwus _METHOD_ is overexpressed compared to atwus . in some cases we have observed the appearance of embryogenic calli directly on the explant _PROTEIN_ the fusion atwus _METHOD_ . compared to the _METHOD_ control atwus overexpressor calli produced many more embryogenic cell clusters . the clusters contained dark blue stained active cells indicating a high rate of soluble proteins with a _PROTEIN_ cell wall a big _LOCATION_ and a single nucleolus . these cytological features are common to embryogenic cells in general whatever the species . the macroscopic morphology of embryogenic lines overexpressing _METHOD_ was identical to that of lines we previously transformed with gus gene or various genes of interest . the tissues overexpressing _METHOD_ have passed through the classical stages leading to somatic embryogenesis and plantlet regeneration typically observed in cotton . different stages of differentiation are usually found in a single cotton embryogenic line and the embryogenic lines can simultaneously proliferate and form embryos during several years on hormone free medium . accordingly control embryogenic lines including those overexpressing _METHOD_ produced several types of structures aggregates of embryogenic cells pro embryos and embryos at different stages of development . embryogenic lines overexpressing atwus differed from this typical scenario and produced tissues going through three distinct stages of differentiation . the first stage corresponded to embryogenic aggregates same as control at the time of appearance but that rapidly evolved in clusters initially forming small pale yellow round structures then growing into large round structures distinguished as the second stage . in the third stage these structures evolved into even larger green _METHOD_ usually not observed during cotton regeneration . at stage and beyond these structures can exhibit characteristics of somatic embryos with a well organized root pole . we conclude that the formation of abnormal embryo like structures results from the constitutive _PROTEIN_ of atwus . tissues in embryogenic lines overexpressing either atwus or _METHOD_ were conducted . similar to control embryogenic tissues the atwus induced embryo like structures can be _PROTEIN_ on a hormone free medium through multiplication of similar adventitious embryos produced by budding . more than embryogenic lines were thereby subcultured with a stable phenotype for over years . despite the _PROTEIN_ that embryoids over _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ have never gone into differentiation of shoots ectopic leaf like structures were produced by these embryoid formations . this phenomenon has never been observed on control somatic embryos . histological examination showed that these ectopic leafy structures arise from the peripheral zone of the embryo like structures where cells actively divide . the leaf like formations developed on embryos _PROTEIN_ atwus alone as well as atwus _METHOD_ . in the latter case the corresponding _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was detected in the _LOCATION_ as expected for the atwus fusion protein . confocal imaging of embryogenic like formations _PROTEIN_ atwus _METHOD_ revealed that signal was highest in the globular formations arising at the peripheral zone . these formations are constituted of active meristematic cells as shown by nbb coloration . this observation suggests that the _PROTEIN_ of atwus leads to the reactivation of cells giving rise to organogenic structures . some of the embryogenic lines transformed with the atwus or _METHOD_ atwus transgenes did not show a developmental pattern giving rise to embryo like structures . instead they only grew as proliferating tissues without any embryonic differentiation remaining at stage . therefore we tested the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in this type of tissue as well as in the structures . rt pcrs have been done with tissues exhibiting globular green _METHOD_ and cultures of undifferentiated _PROTEIN_ lines . all tissues were sampled after the same delay of year in in vitro culture . atwus _PROTEIN_ was only detected in embryogenic structures . the results indicate that transformed embryogenic tissue not evolving into and embryo like structures do not _PROTEIN_ atwus confirming that formations and ectopic leaf like structures result from overexpression of atwus . endogenous iaa levels were measured in atwus overexpressing embryogenic callus and in _METHOD_ overexpressors for two independent experiments with ten samples . no differences were seen for iaa content between atwus and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ lines .
