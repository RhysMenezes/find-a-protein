the yellow stripe like family of proteins has been identified based on sequence similarity to maize yellow the transporter responsible for the primary uptake of iron from the soil . transports iron that is complexed by specific plant derived fe chelators called phytosiderophores . non grass species of plants neither make nor use ps yet ysl family members are found in non grass species including arabidopsis thaliana . ysls in non grasses have been hypothesized to transport metals complexed by nicotianamine an iron chelator that is structurally similar to ps and which is found in all higher plants . here we show that arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ transports iron and copper when these metals are chelated by na . _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ in many cell types in both roots and shoots suggesting that diverse cell types obtain metals as metal na complexes . _PROTEIN_ transcription is regulated by the levels of iron and copper in the growth medium . based on its _PROTEIN_ pattern a major function of the _PROTEIN_ appears to be in the _PROTEIN_ movement of metals in the vasculature .
