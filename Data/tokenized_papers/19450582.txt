full length tyrosine decarboxylase cdna _PROTEIN_ from arabidopsis thaliana was identified by rapid amplification of cdna ends pcr and isolated by rt pcr . the _PROTEIN_ mrna was substantially induced by drought stress and wounding and was considerably _PROTEIN_ by salt stress . by using _PROTEIN_ protein fusions with green _METHOD_ protein an intracellular localization to the cytoplasm was shown . recombinant _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ in escherichia coli and enzymatically characterized it exclusively catalyzed the conversion of l tyrosine to tyramine exhibited an optimum temperature of and an optimum ph at approximately . recombinant _PROTEIN_ protein formed tetramers as shown by blue native gel electrophoresis .
all available mrna sequences for _PROTEIN_ lacked information on the untranslated region of the gene . likewise no full length _PROTEIN_ est clones can be found in publicly available databases . by using primers specific for the annotated open reading frame _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ we were not able to amplify _PROTEIN_ by rt pcr thus we concluded that the sequence in the region of the gene is perhaps misannotated . to determine the full length cdna sequence of _PROTEIN_ we thus undertook a _PROTEIN_ pcr approach . starting from the predicted middle of the third exon an extended cdna fragment of bp containing additional sequence was produced . by combining it with the annotated _PROTEIN_ mrna sequence we obtained a new orf of bp that corresponds to the full length cdna . sequence analysis revealed misinterpreted exon intron junctions between the first two exons in the database sequence . summarizes the results on the exon intron structure and on the untranslated region of _PROTEIN_ . using oligonucleotides specific for the obtained coding region of _PROTEIN_ allowed the amplification of full length _PROTEIN_ . the difference between the deduced amino acid sequence of _PROTEIN_ and the annotated sequence is restricted to the extreme n terminus . the experimentally determined _PROTEIN_ amino acid sequence is missing the first ten amino acid residues of the annotated sequence . the rest of the primary sequence is identical to the annotated sequence thus the polypeptide remains its significant homology with aadcs from other plant species . the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in potato is regulated by environmental stress . other studies report an involvement of _PROTEIN_ in plant defense and wound response . in this _PROTEIN_ it appeared rewarding to analyze whether arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ transcription is also responding to external stimuli . for this purpose different stimuli e.g . wounding transition to darkness temperature drought and high salt conditions were tested by qrt pcr for their ability to influence _PROTEIN_ transcription . _PROTEIN_ transcription strongly responds to wounding . _PROTEIN_ levels peak within min and transcript levels decline thereafter . furthermore _PROTEIN_ was rapidly activated by drought stress reaching maximum levels after min . in contrast heat and cold stress as well as stimulation by pathogens triggered no significant alteration of _PROTEIN_ transcripts . salt stress gave rise to a transient _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ levels by approximately after min . time course experiments uncovered a substantial and transient induction of _PROTEIN_ gene _PROTEIN_ by meja . in this series of experiments both coronatine and opda were by far less effective . plant _PROTEIN_ are suggested to be soluble proteins located in the cytoplasm . to determine the intracellular targeting of _PROTEIN_ several reporter constructs were cloned for transient transformation of a. thaliana pavement cells using particle bombardment for gene delivery . _PROTEIN_ full length cdna was fused to _METHOD_ on either the or the end of the gene . the transient _PROTEIN_ studies with the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusions suggest a cytoplasmic localization of the chimeric proteins almost resembling the results for the cytoplasmic control . for his tagged _PROTEIN_ an apparent molecular _METHOD_ of approximately kda was estimated by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . the recombinant protein refused all other substrates other than l tyrosine suggesting _PROTEIN_ to be a specific l tyrosine decarboxylase _PROTEIN_ . the enzyme exhibits a broad temperature optimum with a maximum at . at temperatures above protein activity sharply declines . the ph optimum is relatively broad maximum enzyme activity can be detected at ph . at ph values above the enzymatic activity rapidly declines . _PROTEIN_ shows michaelis menten kinetics with l tyrosine concentrations up to mm . to determine both the maximum reaction rate and the substrate affinity of _PROTEIN_ the lineweaver burk equation was used . this led to the calculation of a v max of nkat and a k m of mm _PROTEIN_ . to explore a possible oligomerization of _PROTEIN_ we estimated its subunit state by non denaturing blue native gel electrophoresis . thereby evidence for an exclusive occurrence of his tagged _PROTEIN_ in tetrameric state could be provided . an immunosignal was only detectable in the range of the kda marker .
