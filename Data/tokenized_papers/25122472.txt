the proteomic composition of the arabidopsis _LOCATION_ apparatus is currently reasonably well documented however little is known about the relative abundances between different proteins within this compartment . accurate quantitative information of _LOCATION_ resident proteins is of great importance it facilitates a better understanding of the biochemical processes that take place within this organelle especially those of different polysaccharide synthesis pathways . _LOCATION_ resident proteins are _PROTEIN_ to quantify because the abundance of this organelle is relatively low within the cell . in this study an organelle fractionation approach targeting the _LOCATION_ apparatus was combined with a label free quantitative _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ to simultaneously localize proteins to the _LOCATION_ apparatus and assess their relative quantity . in total _LOCATION_ localized proteins were quantified . these data show that organelle fractionation in conjunction with label free quantitative _METHOD_ _METHOD_ is a powerful and relatively simple tool to access protein organelle localization and their relative abundances . the findings presented open a unique view on the organization of the plant _LOCATION_ apparatus leading toward unique hypotheses centered on the biochemical processes of this organelle .
the strategy for quantification of _LOCATION_ apparatus proteins is described in figure . density gradient centrifugation allowed partial separation of the _LOCATION_ apparatus from other abundant organelles . the organelle fractions were subjected to data independent acquisition lc _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . individual protein abundance distributions across the gradient were used to determine the _LOCATION_ apparatus sedimentation profile . the fraction most enriched for the _LOCATION_ apparatus was then used for the analysis of protein abundances by the top method . quantitative determination of gradient fractionation profiles of organelle proteins can be used to assign subcellular localization . if the measurement of protein abundance in each fraction is linear and quantitative proteins in different organelles can be distinguished based on their different sedimentation profiles . to assess whether lc _METHOD_ _METHOD_ quantification could be used for localization of _LOCATION_ apparatus proteins label free quantitative proteomic analysis was performed of organelle fractionations targeted at _LOCATION_ enrichment in two biological replicates of arabidopsis callus . the replication allowed estimation of the quality of the analysis . stringent filtering criteria were applied for protein localization analysis a protein needed to be quantified in eight of analyzed fractions in both gradients with at least two fully tryptic unmodified proteotypic peptides . using these criteria sedimentation profiles for proteins were constructed . to investigate the sedimentation profiles of _LOCATION_ localized proteins in the gradients a protein marker set was generated composed of proteins for which subcellular localization has been shown by prior cell biological studies and high homology to well characterized proteins . the marker proteins were divided into two groups _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and non _LOCATION_ . a principal component analysis plot of sedimentation profiles of both experiments combined shown in supplemental figure indicates that these two groups of proteins can be distinguished based on their fractionation profiles . the sedimentation profiles for _LOCATION_ marker proteins in both replicate experiments are shown in figure . these distributions are consistent with the distribution of the galactosyltransferase _GENE_ _LOCATION_ marker protein as measured by western blotting . the marker protein distribution profiles were used to classify unlabeled proteins to either _LOCATION_ or non _LOCATION_ classes using a support vector machine classifier as implemented in the proloc software . the optimal svm parameters obtained as described above yield a macro score of for the marker protein set . of unlabeled proteins that were subjected to the svm classifier only proteins with an svm score greater than or equal to were considered reliably classified . at this threshold proteins were classified as _LOCATION_ residents . the sedimentation profiles for the svm classified _LOCATION_ proteins in both replicate experiments are consistent with the sedimentation profiles of _LOCATION_ marker proteins . of these proteins classified as _LOCATION_ by lc _METHOD_ _METHOD_ proteins have been localized by lopit experiments reported previously . almost all of these proteins were localized by lopit to the _LOCATION_ apparatus showing high consistency between the two methods . of three inconsistent assignments one protein assigned in lopit to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ to be primarily localized to post _LOCATION_ compartments based on recent literature and two proteins are _LOCATION_ and thus may be contaminants in this lc _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _LOCATION_ assigned list five proteins from this list of svm assigned proteins are unique _LOCATION_ assigned proteins not previously reported by a high confidence assignment method . the top method of quantification is a method of converting peptide intensity to protein amount . this quantification method is based on a premise that the sum intensity of the three most intense peptides from any protein has a linear correlation to the given protein concentration _PROTEIN_ of the protein sequence or size . the method was initially applied on qtof instruments and is a standard form of analysis of _METHOD_ acquisitions . this quantification method was _PROTEIN_ implemented on other _METHOD_ . the method has since been applied to assess protein abundances in a variety of _METHOD_ including escherichia coli budding yeast human cell lines and plants . to assess its accuracy in our experiments we analyzed the commercial protein standards universal protein _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . supplemental figure shows protein quantification for the two standards . in general the equimolar proteins in _PROTEIN_ tend to produce similar top values approximately within a _PROTEIN_ of and the method enables the inference of the correct abundance group to which the protein belongs in the _PROTEIN_ standard . given that accuracy and precision of quantification in proteomics experiments using the top method are known to correlate positively with protein abundance for _LOCATION_ protein quantification lc _METHOD_ _METHOD_ data were used from the most _LOCATION_ enriched fraction . the data on organelle sedimentation presented above identified fraction number five as most enriched in _LOCATION_ proteins . from this fraction using the top method the relative molar quantities of _LOCATION_ proteins were determined of quantified proteins from the most _LOCATION_ enriched fraction . these _LOCATION_ proteins consisted of proteins from the known _LOCATION_ proteins marker set additional proteins localized to the _LOCATION_ by svm in this study and proteins localized to the _LOCATION_ in previous lopit experiments . the top lc _METHOD_ _METHOD_ quantification analysis was carried out independently on two biological replicates of _LOCATION_ and showed good reproducibility the was and the median coefficient of variance of quantification was . the _LOCATION_ proteins constitute approximately mol of quantified proteins in the most _LOCATION_ enriched gradient fraction . the _LOCATION_ marker protein overexpressed in the cell cultures _GENE_ was the most abundant protein at mol of the quantified _LOCATION_ proteome . notably when the unfractionated whole callus cell lysate was analyzed by lc _METHOD_ _METHOD_ only four _LOCATION_ proteins were identified and quantified and one of which was the marker protein . this shows that the _LOCATION_ is a very low abundance organelle and also indicates that the organelle fractionation strategy provides significant enrichment of the _LOCATION_ apparatus .
the arabidopsis columbia ecotype liquid grown callus line was used for the preparation of the _LOCATION_ enriched _LOCATION_ and quantitative proteomic analysis . the transgenic line _PROTEIN_ myc was used _PROTEIN_ a _LOCATION_ apparatus marker protein fused with a c myc tag . the conditions of growth were as described in citation . organelle separation was achieved by iodixanol density ultracentrifugation of the homogenized arabidopsis liquid grown callus line as described previously . in brief the plant callus material was harvested d after the culture medium was refreshed and all subsequent steps were performed at . approximately g of callus tissue was homogenized in an equal volume of homogenization buffer . the homogenate was centrifuged for min at two times to remove unbroken cells cell wall components and _LOCATION_ . the supernatant was centrifuged for h at in an rotor at onto a ml cushion containing iodixanol in homogenization buffer . concentrated _LOCATION_ from the interface were collected with a syringe adjusted to iodixanol and spun for h at in a rotor in optiseal ml tubes at to separate organelles on a self forming iodixanol density gradient ml fractions were collected from the upper part of the gradient with fractions to enriched for the _LOCATION_ apparatus that was used in this study . two independent biological replicates were performed from separate callus cultures . the protein samples were precipitated in tca and the pellets were solubilized in mm ammonium bicarbonate and rapigest sf . after protein extraction from the density gradient fractions protein quantities of each fraction were determined by the bca assay and the sample volumes used in subsequent analysis were adjusted accordingly . immunoblot analyses were used to study the sedimentation profile of the _LOCATION_ apparatus along the density gradient by tracking the abundance of the myc protein with a rabbit polyclonal anti c myc antibody a . for each sample the proteins were reduced with mm dithiothreitol for h at alkylated with mm iodoacetamide for h at room temperature and digested with trypsin _PROTEIN_ by applying a trypsin protein ratio and incubating at overnight . concentrated hcl was added to the digestion solution until ph was reached to hydrolyze the acid labile detergent rapigest sf . the solutions were centrifuged to pellet insoluble material before loading of the samples on the lc . the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ protein standards consisting of human proteins in equimolar _PROTEIN_ and a dynamic range of six concentrations ranging from attomol to pmol _PROTEIN_ were used to assess the accuracy of the top quantification . the protein sample was diluted in rapigest sf and digested with trypsin as described above . approximately ng of peptides from fractions of the upper part of the density gradient _LOCATION_ from both biological replicates was separated by the nanoacquity uplc system . loading was kept low to avoid detector the saturation issues described previously . the lc aqueous mobile phase contained formic acid in water and the organic mobile phase contained formic acid in acetonitrile . the samples were injected on a fused silica trapping column and trapped for min at a flow rate of aqueous mobile phase . the separation was performed on a mm column at nl flow rates using a min linear gradient elution . the column was washed with organic mobile phase for min and reequilibrated with organic mobile phase for min . the column temperature was _PROTEIN_ at . peptides fractionated on the nanoacquity were then analyzed in line with a synapt _PROTEIN_ hybrid _METHOD_ _METHOD_ system . the data reported were acquired in _METHOD_ _METHOD_ mode with low energy and high energy scans of _METHOD_ duration each . during high energy scans the collision energy was linearly ramped in the transfer region of triwave from to v. emitters were manufactured by etching a fused silica line with hydrofluoric acid as described by citation . to allow postacquisition lock _METHOD_ correction fibrinopeptide b was infused through the lockspray ion source at a flow rate of nl as an external reference compound _METHOD_ through an auxiliary pump and acquired one time every s for a s period . the _METHOD_ correction was applied to the spectra postacquisition . the full list of instrument settings is available in supplemental table . the raw data were processed with the plgs and _METHOD_ to generate precursor _METHOD_ lists and associated product ion _METHOD_ lists for subsequent protein identification and quantification . the thresholds for low energy ions high energy ions and low energy exact _METHOD_ retention time pairs were set to and counts respectively . the fibrinopeptide was specified as a lock _METHOD_ compound with m/z for z and a d tolerance window . a detailed description of the plgs pipeline is in citation . for _LOCATION_ proteins ranking the database search was performed with the settings suggested by the manufacturer against the _PROTEIN_ version of the nonredundant arabidopsis genome annotation database containing protein sequence entries in which entries with entirely identical sequences were merged into single fasta entries by an in house r script . for _LOCATION_ localized protein quantification the most abundant _LOCATION_ fraction of both biological replicates gradients was searched with false discovery rate _PROTEIN_ cys as the fixed modification and oxidation of met as the variable modification . the database search was performed with the following settings a peptide could be identified by a minimum of one fragment ion and the protein identification required at least three fragment ions and at least one peptide per protein for identification . only proteins with green autocurate thresholds were used in the subsequent analysis . the _METHOD_ proteomics data have been deposited to the proteomexchange consortium through the pride partner repository with the dataset identifier . to obtain protein distributions across the gradient the _METHOD_ pipeline implemented in proloc and based on functionality from synapter and _METHOD_ was developed _METHOD_ . in brief raw data analysis was performed in plgs to get a list of exact _METHOD_ retention times and identified peptides from both arabidopsis forward and scrambled databases . identified peptides from fractions and from the first biological replicate gradient and fractions and from second biological replicate gradient were used to construct a list of m/z and retention times for fully tryptic unmodified proteotypic peptides . these peptide identifications were then transferred to all the acquisitions based on similarity of m/z and retention time . this resulted in and peptides being quantified in the first and second gradient replicates respectively . these peptides were present in at least of gradient fractions in both gradients . the peptide data were converted to protein intensities as follows . for each protein a fraction with the highest number of peptides quantified was nominated as a reference fraction . the protein abundance in that reference fraction was taken as one . then other fractions were quantified against the reference fraction by finding the ratio of the combined intensity for peptides shared between the interrogated and reference fractions . when the quantities in all fractions for a given protein were computed the values were renormalized to give a sum across all fractions . an svm classifier as implemented in the proloc r package was used to infer protein localization . briefly the labeled data were separated into stratified test and training partitions . the latter was submitted to another round of stratified fold cross validation to optimize the svm parameters . model accuracy is evaluated using the macro score / which was calculated as the harmonic mean of the precision precision true positives / _METHOD_ a measure of exactness and recall recall tp/ a measure of completeness . the best pair of parameters was subsequently used in training a classifier on all training profiles before assessment on all test/validation profiles . this procedure was repeated times to estimate generalization performance values and identify suitable model parameters which were then applied to train a model on all marker profiles and classify unlabeled data . the following materials are available in the online version of this article . supplemental figure . _LOCATION_ protein localization by svm . supplemental figure
