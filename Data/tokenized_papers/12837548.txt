the nadh ubiquinone oxidoreductase of the mitochondrial respiratory chain is a large multisubunit complex in eukaryotes containing different subunits . analysis of this complex using blue native gel electrophoresis coupled to tandem _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ has identified a series of different proteins from the model dicot plant arabidopsis and different proteins from the model monocot plant rice . these proteins have been linked back to genes from plant genome sequencing and comparison of this dataset made with predicted orthologs of complex i components in these plants . this analysis reveals that plants contain the series of highly conserved complex i subunits found in other eukaryotic and related prokaryotic enzymes and a small set of proteins widely found in eukaryotic complexes . a significant number of the proteins present in bovine complex i but absent from fungal complex i are also absent from plant complex i and are not encoded in plant genomes . a series of plant specific _LOCATION_ encoded complex i associated subunits were identified including a series of ferripyochelin binding protein like subunits and a range of small proteins of unknown function . this represents a post genomic and large scale analysis of complex i composition in higher plants .
separation of mitochondrial _LOCATION_ by bn _PROTEIN_ allows the separation of intact electron transport chain complexes on the basis of their apparent molecular _METHOD_ . subsequent second dimension separation of the subunits within each complex using reducing _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ displays these subunits for analysis . our separation of arabidopsis and rice _LOCATION_ proteins in this manner revealed a series of complexes . we are undertaking a comprehensive identification of the proteins in each of these complexes and in present the very high molecular _METHOD_ section of bn _PROTEIN_ gels from arabidopsis and rice . several protein complexes are evident . the identification of four of these high molecular _METHOD_ complexes in arabidopsis was confirmed by sequencing components from each by _METHOD_ . the predicted _METHOD_ of the complexes were derived by comparison with _METHOD_ observed in potato mitochondrial preparations . the largest of the protein complexes contained a series of kda subunits . _METHOD_ _METHOD_ revealed that these were products from prohibitin like genes in both arabidopsis and rice . this complex is likely to be an oligomer of prohibitin chaperonin proteins . a similar prohibitin complex with a native _METHOD_ of > kda has been identified in yeast where genetic studies have shown that it is essential for cell survival and is associated with proteolysis by the clp protease system . the second largest complex on the bn _PROTEIN_ strip is the nadh ubiquinone oxidoreductase or complex i of the respiratory chain . in arabidopsis this complex was present consistently in two _METHOD_ of slightly different mobilities on bn _PROTEIN_ . in rice on the other hand only a single form of complex i was observed . the native _METHOD_ of complex i has been estimated at approximately kda in higher plants . following complex i the edge of the f f o _PROTEIN_ synthase is apparent with a _METHOD_ of approximately kda . near the f f o complex a small amount of _LOCATION_ bound _PROTEIN_ complex _METHOD_ is apparent this protein complex is much more prominent on bn _PROTEIN_ separations of soluble plant mitochondrial proteins . complex i from both plant species separated into a large number of individual bands following _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . a small number of these proteins have been identified from other plant species by n terminal sequencing and the use of cross reacting antibodies . in order to systematically identify the arabidopsis and rice proteins bands were excised trypsin digested and the resultant peptides analyzed by collision _METHOD_ and database matching . a set of bands from the low mobility complex i and bands from the high mobility form of complex i from arabidopsis were analyzed along with bands from the rice complex i . this full range of separated protein bands was obtained using tris glycine _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ to separate protein bands in the > kda range and tris tricine _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ to separate in the < kda range . thirty different proteins were identified in the gel bands of complex i from arabidopsis and different proteins in the gel bands in rice _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . database searching revealed that some of these proteins were orthologs of known complex i components from other eukaryotes _PROTEIN_ . in arabidopsis the products of four mitochondrial encoded subunits _PROTEIN_ were detected along with products of _LOCATION_ encoded known complex i gene orthologs . in rice the products of _PROTEIN_ and were detected but the absence of the gene sequences for _PROTEIN_ forced matching of these peptides to the homologous gene from other plants . the high degree of identity of these mitochondrial nad genes across plants allowed accurate matching of the rice peptides across species . the products of _LOCATION_ encoded known complex i genes from rice were also identified . in addition to these counterparts of well known complex i proteins _PROTEIN_ we identified a further set of proteins largely of unknown function from both arabidopsis and rice _PROTEIN_ . both species contained proteins at kda that comprise a gene family related to bacterial siderophores known as ferripyochelin binding proteins _PROTEIN_ . these proteins have not been shown to be associated with complex i from other eukaryotes to our knowledge and no clear orthologs are present in mammalian genomes or the n. crassa genome . both rice and arabidopsis contain orthologs with identity to swiss prot a amino acid n terminal sequence from potato complex i submitted by u. herz and l. grohmann in as the kda subunit of nadh dehydrogenase . an identical potato protein has been claimed to be the plant _PROTEIN_ synthase inhibitor protein despite the very low homology of these proteins to the inhibitor protein from other eukaryotes . whatever the possible involvement with the _PROTEIN_ synthase it _METHOD_ clear that this protein is found prominently in complex i preparations from potato arabidopsis and rice . rice also contains two proteins annotated as nadh dehydrogenase kda proteins based on n terminal identity to a amino acid n terminal sequence from a potato complex i subunit purified by u. herz and entered in the swiss prot database . an arabidopsis ortholog of this protein also exists and is annotated at the munich information centre for protein sequences as but the tigr locus entry of the same name is a frame shifted protein sequence in the same region . we have no evidence to date for this _PROTEIN_ protein 's presence in our arabidopsis complex i preparation . a series of small molecular _METHOD_ proteins were also discovered in both arabidopsis and rice complex i . the very similar products of the and genes and the rice ortholog were found . these proteins are predicted to contain mitochondrial targeting presequences by both predotar and targetp but their sequences do not match to proteins of known or predicted function _PROTEIN_ . there is some similarity of the rice sequence to a region near the n terminus of the mammalian and n. crassa mitochondrial complex i component but this similarity is not very evident in the arabidopsis sequences and may be a coincidence . the arabidopsis protein encoded by and the rice ortholog were also found but neither were predicted to be mitochondrial by the prediction _METHOD_ used here . the presence of these proteins in both species provides good initial evidence for the future investigation of these proteins as possible complex i components in plants . finally there are a series of proteins identified that require extra research to more clearly define their role as potential complex i components . in arabidopsis the higher mobility complex i form contained a distinct protein band at kda . sequencing revealed this protein to be galactono lactone dehydrogenase . this enzyme is responsible for the final step of ascorbate biosynthesis that occurs on the inner mitochondrial _LOCATION_ in plants . the location and association of this protein with complex i was previously unknown although a biochemical link with the electron transport chain had been established . we were not able to identify this protein in our rice complex i samples from dark grown rice shoots perhaps due to very low _PROTEIN_ of genes encoding ascorbate synthesizing proteins under such conditions or the lack of co migration of this enzyme with complex i in rice . the plant complex i preparations also contain two additional small proteins that do not contain any obvious sequence identity to either each other or to proteins of known function from other eukaryotes . both proteins contain mitochondrial targeting presequences according to multiple prediction _METHOD_ . this provides some further bioinformatic evidence that they are likely to represent legitimate _METHOD_ identifications of mitochondrial proteins . however these single identifications need to be further investigated to substantiate _METHOD_ of their association with complex i . it should be noted that these identifications are based on purification of complex i by a one step process blue native gel electrophoresis largely due to the low yields of mitochondria from these model plant species . while this technique has produced impressive separation of native complexes in its application to mitochondrial samples the possibility that co elution of complexes or nonspecific association of protein to complexes during this procedure must be entertained . in it 's defense we have not found known components of other major electron transport chain complexes or carrier proteins identified by _METHOD_ in our complex i lane _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ but we can not discount the possibility that some of the plant specific proteins observed in our complex i preparations could be due to such co elution or nonspecific associations . given the diversity of the proteins found in the plant complex i preparations it seemed advisable to consider the findings of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in the context of which counterparts to known complex i proteins had been found and whether the missing counterparts were in _PROTEIN_ present in plant genomes . all of the mammalian genes for the _LOCATION_ encoded proteins and the mitochondrial encoded proteins of complex i have been sequenced . a generic nomenclature for complex i genes taking into account the structural association data has been proposed for the human genes and is used as a helpful basis for _PROTEIN_ . purified complex i can be disassociated into and subcomplexes . the complex contains the flavoprotein subcomplex the fe s center subcomplex proteins and a range of proteins of unknown function . the subcomplex contains a set of proteins apparently originating from the _LOCATION_ arm of the complex but with no known function . several subunits are lost from the complex during and complex separation and one protein the sdap protein is localized in both subcomplexes . the mitochondrial encoded proteins in mammals are orthologs of the bacterial nuoa and nuoj nuon products . the five proteins responsible for directly binding fe s centers and/or fmn along with two fe s subcomplex proteins are counterparts of the bacterial nuob nuog proteins . the products of these orthologous genes are also found in the extensively studied complex i from the fungus n. crassa . in addition a series of ten n. crassa complex i proteins have mammalian analogs _PROTEIN_ while a set of four n. crassa complex i components have no known counterparts in the mammalian complex . on the basis of this information the human protein sequences were used to search genomic and est databases from arabidopsis and rice to identify probable plant orthologs . in arabidopsis orthologs of all conserved subunits were identified with only one existing as a family of two members the orthologs and . in addition orthologs for other mammalian complex i subunits were identified _PROTEIN_ . in rice the lack of a complete mitochondrial genome sequence hampered identification although ample evidence exists for the conservation of nd genes in the rice mitochondrial genome _PROTEIN_ . orthologs for of the highly conserved complex i subunits have been sequenced in rice _LOCATION_ encoded genes and mitochondrial encoded genes . in addition a series of other genes encoding proteins with similarity to mammalian complex i subunits were identified . in higher plants two genes encoding fe s subcomplex proteins that are _LOCATION_ encoded in n. crassa and mammalian species are encoded in the plant mitochondrial genome as _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . only one of the seven n. crassa complex i genes that do not have mammalian counterparts appears to have plant counterparts namely the subunit _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . neither of the newly identified mammalian components _PROTEIN_ and esss have clear orthologs in plant genomes _PROTEIN_ . looking across the dataset presented in _PROTEIN_ it appears that a significant number of the mammalian _LOCATION_ encoded complex i subunits have no clear orthologs yet identified in the genomes of fungi and higher plants . nearly all of the subcomplex components are currently missing along with both ndufc components and several components in the i subcomplex . it is possible that orthologous components do exist but are absent from our analysis due to very divergent sequence this possibility awaits further experimental analysis of the plant complex i and more extensive bioinformatic analysis . a core set of nine proteins not found in the prokaryotic enzyme do appear to be conserved across all the eukaryotes analyzed . this set is currently much smaller than the set of subunits that have been identified in mammals and are not present in the bacterial enzyme . when this genomic analysis _PROTEIN_ is linked with components definitively identified in purified plant complex i _PROTEIN_ an interesting pattern emerges _PROTEIN_ . the fe s subcomplex proteins and flavoprotein subcomplex components dominate those proteins positively identified by _METHOD_ in the plant complexes while products of most of the _LOCATION_ encoded genes conserved between plants and other eukaryotes were also found to be present . however in the case of both arabidopsis and rice a number of sequence orthologs of mammalian components have currently not be detected in plant genomes _PROTEIN_ . also clear complex i like genes present in the plant genomes were observed in some cases to be consistently missing from the complexes purified by bn _PROTEIN_ from the two species . it must be noted that hydrophobic proteins and those that do not digest with trypsin will be likely to remain undetected using these experimental approaches and so such nondetections can not be considered definitive evidence of absence . however it is noteworthy that most of these proteins currently undetected in plant complexes and/or genomes represent components for which no functional role has been described in any system to date .
a heterotrophic arabidopsis cell culture established from callus of ecotype lansberg _LOCATION_ stem explants was _PROTEIN_ by weekly subculture in murashige and skoog basal media supplemented with sucrose mg/l naphthaleneacetic acid and mg/l kinetin . the cell cultures were _PROTEIN_ in ml conical flasks in the dark at in an orbital shaker . at days each flask contained g fw cells and growth was approximately in the middle of the log phase . subculture of ml of culture to ml of fresh media initiated the cycle again . a total of l of day old dark grown cell suspension culture was filtered through gauze to remove media and then the cells disrupted in a waring blender by three successive s bursts . disruption of g of cells was performed in ml of grinding medium bovine serum albumin pvp mm egta mm cysteine ph . filtered cell extract was separated by differential centrifugation and mitochondria purified from the resultant organelle pellets by two percoll gradients according to millar et al . . approximately mg of total mitochondrial protein is obtained using this approach . batches of g of rice seed were washed in bleach for mins rinsed in distilled water and grown in the dark in vermiculite slats at a constant watered daily and grown for days . rice shoots were harvested using scissors and cut into mm lengths into a beaker on ice . cut shoots were ground in a precooled mortar and pestle using acid washed sand in ml of homogenization solution . after filtering homogenate through four layers of miracloth it was centrifuged for min at g then the supernatant again centrifuged at g for min . the resultant organelle pellet was resuspended in wash buffer _PROTEIN_ bsa and the two centrifugation steps repeated to produce a washed organelle pellet . this resuspended pellet was layered over pvp preformed gradient in a percoll self forming gradient in wash buffer and centrifuged at g for min . mitochondria formed a band towards the bottom of the gradient the upper _LOCATION_ material was discarded and the mitochondrial band removed attempting to minimize contamination of peroxisomal material from the bottom of the gradient . following two wash centrifugation steps at g for min the pellet was layered over a second self forming gradient consisting of percoll in wash buffer and centrifuged for min at g . mitochondria remained near the top of the gradient while remaining peroxisomal material migrated to the bottom of the gradient . the mitochondrial layer was aspirated and concentrated by wash centrifugation steps at g for min . approximately mg of total rice mitochondrial protein is obtained by this approach . bn _PROTEIN_ was performed largely according to jansch et al . . gels consisted of a separating gel and a stacking gel formed in a solution of m amino n caproic acid and mm bis tris hcl . the anode buffer consisted of mm tricine mm bis tris hcl w/v blue _PROTEIN_ and the cathode buffer of mm bis tris hcl . mitochondrial sample pellets were suspended to approximately mg ml in mm _PROTEIN_ freeze thawed repeatedly in liquid n and centrifuged for min at g . _LOCATION_ pellets were then washed with mm _PROTEIN_ . aliquots of mg of _LOCATION_ protein were suspended in of an aca buffer solution followed by addition of of a freshly prepared solution of n dodecylmaltoside . after min centrifugation at g of w/v blue _PROTEIN_ was added to the supernatants . gels were run at in a precooled apparatus with all samples and buffers precooled to . approximately min before the run w/v n dodecylmaltoside was added to the cathode buffer only . electrophoresis was commenced at v constant voltage for min and then increased to ma without voltage limitation for h. bn lanes were cut from gels equilibrated in standard _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ sample buffer for min laid horizontally on acrylamide _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ separating gels sealed in with agarose and electrophoresis continued for h under standard conditions . q tof _METHOD_ was performed on an applied _METHOD_ q _PROTEIN_ pulsar _METHOD_ using an ionspray source . protein spots to be analyzed were cut from bn _PROTEIN_ gels destained dried at in a dry block heater and stored at . for the sequencing analysis the proteins were digested with trypsin according to sweetlove et al . injected into the electrospray source in formic acid and selected doubly charged peptides identified in _METHOD_ tof mode fragmented by n collision and analyzed by _METHOD_ . _METHOD_ spectra and collision _METHOD_ data were analyzed with analyst _PROTEIN_ bioanalyst and proid software _METHOD_ . sequence orthologs were identified by blast analysis of n. crassa and bovine genes against of the arabidopsis protein set a draft rice genome protein set and rice gene indices all distributed by the institute for genomic research and the arabidopsis and rice national center for biotechnology information entries . the e values of matches were recorded to give an indication of the degree of similarity between the plant and mammalian sequences . e values were obtained from blastp and tblastn analyses . the most significant match was utilized for the determination of sequence orthologs in many cases this represented a relatively stringent e value of less than . where low levels of identity were observed further sequence structural analyses were undertaken to confirm them as likely matches . predotar targetp and mitoprot targeting predictions were determined using full length predicted protein sequences .
