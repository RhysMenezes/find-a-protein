chloroplasts and mitochondria contain a family of putative preprotein and amino acid transporters designated prat . here we analyzed the role of two previously characterized prat protein family members encoded by _GENE_ and _GENE_ in planta using a combination of genetic cell biological and biochemical approaches . _PROTEIN_ studies and green _METHOD_ protein tagging identified both in chloroplasts and mitochondria whereas was located exclusively in chloroplasts . biochemical evidence was obtained for an association of mitochondrial with two distinct protein complexes one containing the inner _LOCATION_ translocase _PROTEIN_ and the other containing an alternative nad h dehydrogenase subunit _PROTEIN_ implicated in a respiratory complex electron transport chain . through its association with _PROTEIN_ is involved in the uptake of carrier proteins and other hydrophobic _LOCATION_ proteins lacking cleavable presequences whereas 's interaction with _PROTEIN_ may permit controlling mitochondrial biogenesis and activity .
specific antisera were raised against and for localization and _PROTEIN_ studies . for comparison antibodies were raised against and . the final antisera obtained were used to probe protein gel blots separating total leaf as well as chloroplast and mitochondrial extracts . figure shows that and were barely detectable in leaf extracts . consistent with previous results and database analyses performed at the resource platform of the university of toronto and were found in chloroplasts . similar results were obtained for and . for and signals were also obtained in mitochondrial protein extracts from weeks old arabidopsis plants . time course experiments illustrated a negative light regulation of and _PROTEIN_ in d old etiolated plants during greening . by contrast and were constitutively _PROTEIN_ . respective control analyses demonstrated the differential regulation of nadph protochlorophyllide oxidoreductase _PROTEIN_ the major light harvesting chlorophyll protein of photosystem ii and the of the during greening . using bacterially _PROTEIN_ and proteins in vitro import assays were conducted with isolated arabidopsis chloroplasts and isolated arabidopsis mitochondria . in a first set of experiments and were incubated with chloroplasts that had been isolated by percoll/sucrose density centrifugation from arabidopsis plants . after various periods chloroplasts were collected by centrifugation and before being treated with thermolysin a protease frequently used to degrade unimported proteins adhering to the outer _LOCATION_ envelope during _LOCATION_ . when import was analyzed and were found to attain conformations suggestive of conformational changes to occur upon binding to the _LOCATION_ envelope or import to proceed across the envelope _LOCATION_ during incubation . controls with the small subunit precursor of _PROTEIN_ confirmed that the uptake assays were productive . additional controls revealed that and were per se sensitive to thermolysin and degraded when incubated in the absence of chloroplasts . and behaved as integral _LOCATION_ proteins of the inner _LOCATION_ envelope _LOCATION_ as demonstrated by fractionation and salt extraction experiments with mol/l nacl and mol/l ph . after both treatments and were present in the _LOCATION_ pellets but not corresponding supernatants obtained after centrifugation of the incubation mixtures . fractionation and protease protection assays carried out for the endogenous confirmed the localization and topology of in the mitochondrial inner _LOCATION_ . transgenic _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis plants confirmed the chloroplast localization of _METHOD_ fusion protein . by analogy _METHOD_ studied in parallel was located in chloroplasts but not in mitochondria . unlike and and were targeted to isolated mitochondria in vitro and attained proteinase conformations . mitochondrial uptake assays with the precursors of the alternative oxidase and the inner _LOCATION_ carrier protein adenine nucleotide translocator _PROTEIN_ proved the functionality of the import assays . incubations carried out in the absence of mitochondria showed that and were not intrinsically resistant to proteinase k . in more refined experiments the sublocalization of in mitochondria was examined . incubations were performed in the absence or presence of valinomycin to dissipate the _LOCATION_ potential . data in figure demonstrate the formation of proteinase in mitochondria irrespective of the presence of valinomycin . by contrast did not produce bands and was degraded by proteinase k . rupture of the outer mitochondrial _LOCATION_ following import but prior to protease digestion resulted in a fragment of . the appearance of this fragment was reminiscent of that routinely obtained for the inner mitochondrial _LOCATION_ protein _PROTEIN_ that is broken down up to its _LOCATION_ portion by protease . addition of valinomycin dissipating the followed by rupture of the outer mitochondrial _LOCATION_ resulted in the degradation of imported and by added proteinase k a result consistent with what is expected for an integral inner _LOCATION_ protein that could not reach its final destination and accumulated in the intermembrane space . when rabbit was used in parallel experiments several bands were obtained presumably resulting from internal translation initiation at subsequent methionine codons or partial proteolysis of the newly produced _PROTEIN_ proteins . importantly the two uppermost bands bound mitochondria and were imported into the inner _LOCATION_ . on the basis of these data we concluded that is an integral inner mitochondrial _LOCATION_ protein . the localization and function of in mitochondria were examined further in subsequent experiments . was _PROTEIN_ as _PROTEIN_ protein in escherichia coli and purified and used for in vitro uptake experiments with mitochondria that had been isolated from d old arabidopsis plants . after different incubations under standard import conditions complexes formed with were isolated by agarose chromatography from ruptured mitochondria eluted and analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis _PROTEIN_ . the protein pattern consisted of and six _PROTEIN_ polypeptide groups . protein sequencing identified the new bands to represent _PROTEIN_ the mitochondrial intermembrane space import and assembly protein _PROTEIN_ three proteins dubbed tiny _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ implicated in the mitochondrial import of carrier proteins and proteins the outer mitochondrial _LOCATION_ receptor _PROTEIN_ the subunit of the alternative nad h dehydrogenase _PROTEIN_ and mitochondrial import motor protein _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were not well resolved under the electrophoresis conditions used here and migrated as a single band of kda . for _PROTEIN_ two bands were seen of which the upper most likely represents a covalent adduct comprising _PROTEIN_ and held together by a mixed disulfide bond . as shown previously easily _METHOD_ such intermediates . the simultaneous presence of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in the protein pattern obtained with suggested that there might be different protein complexes in the inner mitochondrial _LOCATION_ containing . when the protein mixture eluted from the column was subjected to _PROTEIN_ indeed one _PROTEIN_ band and several other bands were obtained . western blotting showed that at least three of these bands contained the other bands may represent assembly intermediates of or contaminations . one of the specific bands designated also contained _PROTEIN_ and thus appears to represent a complex involved in the uptake of _LOCATION_ precursor proteins into the inner mitochondrial _LOCATION_ . in gel filtration assays eluted at an apparent molecular _METHOD_ of kda . the second band designated eluted at kda and the third band eluted at kda . the latter band likely represents unassembled trapped in detergent micelles . the elution profile of the two _PROTEIN_ bands was indistinguishable from that of the native . thus with a very good likelihood the complexes formed with in vitro were reflecting those established with the endogenous in vivo . we next imported _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ into mitochondria and purified by on agarose protein complexes from total mitochondrial _LOCATION_ . after _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ gave rise to a complex that corresponded to complex seen before whereas _PROTEIN_ gave rise to a _PROTEIN_ complex that corresponded to complex . both complexes contained as demonstrated by western blotting . western blotting with _PROTEIN_ antibodies identified two additional _PROTEIN_ bands the identity of which was not analyzed further . when the isolated complexes were analyzed by _PROTEIN_ two protein patterns were obtained that were fundamentally different for complex and complex . while complex contained _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and as well as some other proteins complex contained _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ as well as a few minor bands . results shown in figure underscored the identity of interactions established by in vitro and in vivo . collectively these data resolved the results shown in figure in _METHOD_ of the presence of two structurally and functionally different complexes in mitochondria in which is involved . complex very likely plays a role in the import of proteins containing hydrophobic _LOCATION_ spans including carrier proteins and does so by the combined action of _PROTEIN_ and that both are prat proteins and contain conserved sterile alpha motives _METHOD_ operating as protein interaction domains . import through the _PROTEIN_ complex is coupled to the import motor and folding machineries operating in the _PROTEIN_ as well as intermembrane space _PROTEIN_ . complex also contains and _PROTEIN_ but lacks _PROTEIN_ and instead contains _PROTEIN_ . this suggests complex to couple alternative _PROTEIN_ electron transport to normal and oxidative _PROTEIN_ protein folding . the roles of and were followed up by rna interference using previously established lines . consistent with previous results none of the rnai plants had a visible phenotype if grown under continuous white light illumination . however when cultivated under h white light h dark cycles plant growth was retarded and depending on the light intensity used gave rise to a chlorotic phenotype similar to that described by murcha et al . for double mutants . strikingly etiolated rnai plants were conditionally and died when illuminated . terminal deoxyribonucleotidyl nick measurements and dna fragmentation analyses by conventional agarose gel electrophoresis revealed _METHOD_ dna breakdown to occur in illuminated rnai versus seedlings . if would cooperate with _PROTEIN_ in the import of transit mitochondrial proteins lack of should lead to reductions or depletions in the inner mitochondrial _LOCATION_ protein pattern . to avoid any phototoxic effects associated with greening mitochondria were isolated from d old plants . then inner mitochondrial _LOCATION_ proteins were prepared and their proteins analyzed by _PROTEIN_ . figure shows that the patterns of mitochondrial inner _LOCATION_ proteins were distinct for and rnai seedlings . the patterns differed by the abundance of several higher and lower molecular _METHOD_ proteins . protein sequencing and protein gel blot analyses revealed that while _PROTEIN_ was reduced in amount _PROTEIN_ was entirely absent from the inner mitochondrial _LOCATION_ of rnai plants . for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ elevated protein levels were seen as compared to those in the . in vitro uptake assays revealed that while yet imported could not assemble further with other components of the inner mitochondrial _LOCATION_ in rnai plants and thus did not form higher molecular _METHOD_ complexes as those in plants . a possible explanation could be that because of the reduced amount or even complete lack of respective partner proteins including _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ lacked ability to establish larger complexes . it is attractive to hypothesize that the observed of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ as seen at the rna and protein levels could be a mechanism to account for the increased import needs of rnai plants for transit proteins including . to test this hypothesis was imported into isolated and rnai mitochondria . incubations were carried out in the absence or presence of valinomycin to dissipate the _LOCATION_ potential . data in figure demonstrated the faithful uptake of into mitochondria as concluded from the appearance of proteinase band . rupture of the outer mitochondrial _LOCATION_ following import but prior to protease digestion resulted in the major fragment of seen before in figure . a second smaller and much less abundant fragment of was observed . when import was analyzed for rnai mitochondria only this minor lower molecular _METHOD_ fragment of appeared . interestingly this band already was present in assays to which proteinase k had not been added yet suggesting a topology different from that of generating the _PROTEIN_ proteinase _PROTEIN_ band . because the appearance of of was sensitive to valinomycin we concluded that it represents a default product incapable of giving rise to functional complexes . control uptake assays showed a lack of import of other transit proteins such as the oxaloacetate malate translocator and _PROTEIN_ into rnai mitochondria . together these data identified and _PROTEIN_ as essential components of a new pathway of import of transit precursors into mitochondria of arabidopsis .
all mutant and rnai lines used in this study have been described elsewhere . further details can be found in the si section . plants were grown at under conditions except for rnai plants that were cultivated under continuous white light illumination provided by _METHOD_ bulbs . for illumination experiments seeds were with tween and germinated on _METHOD_ agar medium for d before being exposed to white light of either or . conditions for the isolation of chloroplasts and mitochondria in synthesis and protein uptake have been described and are summarized in detail in the si section . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were produced in e. coli strain purified by agarose chromatography and used for isolating protein complexes from mitochondria . briefly intact mitochondria were recovered after the import reaction by centrifugation and suspended in a buffer containing mmol/l mol/l sorbitol at a protein concentration of mg/ml . mitochondria then were solubilized with or digitonin in solubilization buffer containing mmol/l mmol/l mmol/l ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid and mmol/l ethyleneglycoltetraacetic acid and subjected to a centrifugation step at g in a beckman _PROTEIN_ ultracentrifuge rotor for min . gel filtration was carried out on a superose gel filtration column at a flow rate of ml/min in column buffer containing digitonin or octylglucoside . protein was separated by either or denaturing _PROTEIN_ and detected by _METHOD_ staining autoradiography or western blotting with specific antibodies . testing of seedling viability was carried out with tetrazolium using d old etiolated seedlings that had been transferred to white light of or . dna breakage indicative of apoptotic cell death in irradiated rnai seedlings was monitored by agarose gel electrophoresis and ethidium bromide staining or deoxynucleotidyl dutp nick end labeling measurements using apoptag fluorescein in situ apoptosis detection kit _PROTEIN_ . briefly etiolated seedlings were infiltrated in the dark with equilibration buffer containing tdt enzyme and incubated at for h before being exposed to white light for appropriate periods . seedlings were briefly washed with equilibration buffer and incubated for min in the dark with . after another washing step specimens were inspected under a _METHOD_ microscope .
