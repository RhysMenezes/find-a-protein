to gain an insight into the assembly and structure of the plant exocyst we determined the interactions between different exocyst subunits using a _PROTEIN_ yeast assay . interactions between the exocyst subunits _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were determined . in the assessment of the baits _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ showed very strong therefore they could not be used as baits in the interaction test . six pairs of strong interactions were detected for which all three reporter genes were activated _PROTEIN_ interacts with _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ interacts with both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ interacts with _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ interacts with _PROTEIN_ . the lacz reporter gene was activated for two pairs only _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ hence these putative weak interactions need to be confirmed by alternative methods . we decided to focus on _PROTEIN_ because of its prominent role in the yeast exocyst complex . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ arabidopsis possesses two genes that encode _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ which are tandemly duplicated and share sequence identity at the protein level . the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is unable to discriminate between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . however _PROTEIN_ sequence tags and a search against the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ database revealed that both genes are _PROTEIN_ . we determined the temporal and spatial _PROTEIN_ pattern of _PROTEIN_ by _PROTEIN_ of a _PROTEIN_ gene fusion . six independent transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ genomic sequence fused to gus were examined histologically for gus activity . in seedlings _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ in cotyledons and root but not in hypocotyls and highly _PROTEIN_ in shoot apical _METHOD_ . in roots _PROTEIN_ was highly _PROTEIN_ in the root tip the vasculature and _PROTEIN_ root primordia . unlike in younger seedlings _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was observed in the hypocotyls of older seedlings . in both expanding and expanded rosette leaves _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was detected . in flowers _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was not detected in _PROTEIN_ and sepals but strong _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was detected in the stigma unfertilized ovules and pollen . in embryos _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was observed from the early heart stage onwards . thus _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in various tissues of both seedlings and mature plants and preferentially in tissues containing dividing and expanding cells such as the shoot apical meristem root tip _PROTEIN_ root primordia and developing embryos . using a genotyping approach we identified a salk line harboring a insertion in the first intron of the _PROTEIN_ gene . we performed pcr amplification of the _PROTEIN_ allele with primers flanking the insertions and amplification of the mutant _PROTEIN_ allele left and right borders with one primer flanking the insertion and the primer _PROTEIN_ and one primer flanking the insertion and the primer . all pcrs resulted in amplification products of the expected size indicating that the insertion caused no dna rearrangements . we identified only heterozygous and plants . the _PROTEIN_ allele segregated in a ratio of in progeny of selfed heterozygous plants . as no homozygous plants were identified and the segregation ratio of the _PROTEIN_ allele is typical for embryo lethality we tested immature siliques from heterozygous _PROTEIN_ plants for the presence of white or otherwise abnormal seeds . green and white seeds within single siliques were observed whereas only green seeds were present in the immature siliques from plants . as white seeds indicate embryo lethality we scored the number of white seeds from siliques from three individual plants heterozygous for _PROTEIN_ . in all these lines c. of seeds were white suggesting that the _PROTEIN_ mutation is recessively embryo lethal . the mature seeds from heterozygous and plants were also compared showing a mixture of small wrinkled seeds and normal seeds in heterozygous plants and only normal seeds in the . we tested germination by placing wrinkled seeds and normal seeds on _METHOD_ plates to score the germination rate . the normal seeds all germinated but none of the wrinkled seeds had germinated after wk . to determine whether in addition to embryo lethality the _PROTEIN_ mutation causes gametophytic defects we analyzed the progeny of heterozygous _PROTEIN_ lines and performed reciprocal crosses between _PROTEIN_ and plants . in the progeny of _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ allele segregated as expected . in the progeny of the reciprocal crosses the transmission of the _PROTEIN_ allele was not affected when _PROTEIN_ was used as either pollen donor or pollen receiver demonstrating that gametophytic transmission of the _PROTEIN_ allele is normal . thus _PROTEIN_ appears to be essential for plant development . to examine whether the white seeds in the progeny of plants heterozygous for _PROTEIN_ were harboring aborted embryos we investigated embryo development in these seeds . from the stage to the stage we could not discriminate between mutant and embryos . unlike normally developing embryos which become heart shaped d after fertilization the mutant embryos failed to undergo this developmental step . mutant embryos from siliques in which the embryos had developed to the cotyledonary stage were still globular although their size and the number of cells had increased beyond the normal size and number of cells of globular embryos and the cells of the mutant embryo appeared more rounded . to investigate the defects in mutant embryos in more detail we stained the cell walls with calcofluor white . microscopic analysis revealed several aspects although the suspensor looked normal the mutant embryo proper lacked any _PROTEIN_ cells were rounded and cell division occurred in random directions whereas in embryos of the same age an epidermal cell layer had clearly developed . thus although cell division is not inhibited aberrant embryos apparently lack any form of differentiation and _PROTEIN_ . genetic complementation of the _PROTEIN_ mutant was performed by introducing the _PROTEIN_ genomic dna driven by the endogenous _PROTEIN_ promoter _PROTEIN_ into plants heterozygous for _PROTEIN_ . in addition we introduced a similar construct with the _METHOD_ coding region fused to the end of the _PROTEIN_ genomic sequence _METHOD_ . we scored for white seeds in two lines carrying the _PROTEIN_ construct to assess the percentage of seeds in which embryo development was arrested . in contrast with uncomplemented plants that carried c. white seeds both lines had a strongly reduced number of abnormal seeds and respectively . transgenic plants heterozygous for the _PROTEIN_ allele complemented with the _METHOD_ construct showed percentages of white seeds below . the percentages of white seeds observed were lower than that expected in plants carrying one complementation construct indicating that the plants carry more than one complementation construct . indeed backcrossing of these lines with the resulted in progeny with higher percentages of white seeds in five of the seven independent lines and after backcrossing to twice followed by selfing we were able to select four lines that showed c. of white seeds of lines complemented with _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ . approximately of the seedlings of these backcrossed lines carried the hygromycin resistance marker of the complementation construct . both the complemented and the backcrossed lines developed normally and contained normally developed embryos demonstrating that the mutant phenotype is caused by the _PROTEIN_ insertion allele and that both _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ fully complement the mutant phenotype . we determined the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ in transgenic plants carrying the _METHOD_ fusion construct selected as described above in developing embryos root hairs and root epidermal cells . root hairs expand by tip growth their expansion is extremely _PROTEIN_ and occurs exclusively at the tip . root epidermal cell expansion is also _PROTEIN_ but occurs over the whole cell facets parallel to the elongation direction of the root . we refer to this type of cell expansion as axial growth . we studied _METHOD_ localization in both expanding and fully grown cells . in the embryos _METHOD_ accumulated at the periphery of the cells and stained the cytoplasm weakly . in addition to the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ amyloplasts produced _METHOD_ . this _METHOD_ was also present in embryos . because we observed plasmolysis and relocation of the _METHOD_ signal within min after embryo isolation we shifted our focus to root hairs and root epidermal cells that are more suitable for live cell imaging . in both of these cell types we observed _METHOD_ _METHOD_ evenly distributed throughout the cytoplasm and brightly _METHOD_ cell compartments which are clearly visible in fig . . at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ of both cell types _METHOD_ _METHOD_ had a punctate distribution similar to that observed for the other exocyst subunits _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . we did not observe clear differences in the density of the puncta in expanding and fully grown cells . as the tip of growing root hairs harbors many vesicles and is the location of cell elongation it was important to determine the density of _PROTEIN_ puncta at this location . as it is technically _PROTEIN_ to measure the density of puncta in the surface of the dome of the root hair tip because of its curvature we measured the _METHOD_ intensities of _LOCATION_ regions in median confocal sections . cell expansion is fastest at the side of the dome and is slower at the tip of the dome . we measured the _METHOD_ intensities in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ of these two areas and compared these intensities with the _METHOD_ intensity of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ of the tube . surprisingly we did not observe significant differences in _METHOD_ intensity between the different _LOCATION_ areas of the expanding tip and the _LOCATION_ area of the root hair tube _PROTEIN_ . thus _PROTEIN_ puncta at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ do not preferentially accumulate in expanding areas of cells . this suggests that _PROTEIN_ is not specifically recruited to _PROTEIN_ exocytosis events in interphase cells . to determine the behavior over time of the _METHOD_ puncta at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ we photobleached the _METHOD_ that was already present and analyzed the recovery of _METHOD_ over time . we studied the behavior of individual _METHOD_ puncta at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ of tubes of growing and fully grown root hairs and the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ of the outer periclinal face of expanding and fully grown root epidermal cells . in all of these cell types new immobile _METHOD_ _METHOD_ puncta appeared at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ after photobleaching . when puncta first appeared their _METHOD_ was low but detectable . over time their _METHOD_ intensity increased until it reached a maximum intensity whereafter the _METHOD_ intensity gradually _PROTEIN_ until it disappeared completely . the characteristic behavior of _METHOD_ puncta is illustrated in fig . . to check whether there are differences in the lifetime of the puncta between different cell types and/or between growing and fully grown cells we measured the lifetimes of the _METHOD_ puncta in growing and fully grown root epidermal cells and root hair tubes . we collected image sequences with intervals between sequential images determined the amount of frames during which each punctum was present and used these values to calculate an average lifetime . within individual cells lifetimes were highly variable ranging from to s. the average lifetime of _METHOD_ puncta was s in the tube region of growing root hairs s in the tube region of fully grown root hairs s in expanding root epidermal cells and s in fully grown root epidermal cells . the average _METHOD_ punctum lifetime in the growing root hairs was no different from that in fully grown root hairs . the lifetime of puncta in expanding and expanded root epidermal cells is significantly different which can be accounted for by the small population of puncta with long lifetimes in fully expanded root epidermal cells . to test whether _PROTEIN_ is delivered to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ by the _LOCATION_ system we tested whether it associates with the vesicle pool in the apex of expanding root hairs by staining with the amphiphilic styryl dye . it is assumed that decorates _LOCATION_ of endocytotic vesicles rapidly and also that exocytotic vesicles are decorated rapidly . we did not see any _PROTEIN_ accumulation in the region in the apex of growing root hairs other than the _METHOD_ that is present throughout the cytoplasm . from this we conclude that _METHOD_ does not localize to vesicles . this suggests that _PROTEIN_ recruitment to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ is not mediated by the _LOCATION_ system . to investigate whether _PROTEIN_ recruitment to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ depends on exocytosis we applied bfa to growing root hairs and measured the density and lifetime of _METHOD_ puncta at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . bfa is a macrocyclic lactone of fungal origin that inhibits _LOCATION_ secretion in plants . we applied a concentration range of bfa to growing root hairs . the lowest concentration of bfa that caused complete root hair growth inhibition after h was . occasionally swollen root hair tips were observed but root hairs were still alive and cytoplasmic streaming continued . the inhibition of root hair growth showed that treatment with bfa successfully inhibits _LOCATION_ secretion in root hairs . under these conditions _METHOD_ still localized as puncta to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ throughout the root hair tube . however the density of the _METHOD_ puncta was reduced dramatically after h of treatment compared with that in untreated cells . after h of bfa treatment the density had _PROTEIN_ even further . the _METHOD_ puncta still showed their characteristic increase and _PROTEIN_ in _METHOD_ intensity during their lifetime but the average lifetime was increased when compared with control cells and s in control cells p < fig . . the lifetime of _METHOD_ puncta did not change after longer bfa treatment fig . . thus the disruption of exocytotic vesicle production causes a _PROTEIN_ in recruitment and longer lifetimes of _METHOD_ puncta . as the insertion of _PROTEIN_ complexes into the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ which is likely to be an exocytotic event occurs predominantly along cortical microtubules we tested whether _METHOD_ puncta with these cortical microtubules . we crossed an line with _METHOD_ lines . the optical coverage of cortical microtubules in the analyzed cells was . if the _METHOD_ puncta appear at random locations of the cell cortex the expected percentage of puncta with cortical microtubules is c. . of _METHOD_ puncta showed with cortical microtubules which is . this is not significantly different from the expected percentage . to test the of _METHOD_ with _PROTEIN_ complexes directly we crossed a line into a _METHOD_ line and searched for the of _METHOD_ with the insertion of _PROTEIN_ complexes . this was performed by the photobleaching of existing in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . we performed a analysis of newly inserted with _METHOD_ puncta during the insertion process _LOCATION_ and found that only of the _PROTEIN_ complex insertion events correlated with the presence of a _PROTEIN_ punctum at the same location . thus it is unlikely that _PROTEIN_ puncta are involved in exocytosis for the insertion of _PROTEIN_ complexes into the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . in mitotic cells the exocyst subunits _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are localized to the initiating cell plate disappear during cell plate extension and reappear on the division wall for some time after the completion of cytokinesis . to determine whether _PROTEIN_ behaves similarly we studied the localization of _METHOD_ during the course of cell plate formation in dividing cells of the arabidopsis root meristem . in the meristematic cells in both the epidermal and cortical cell layer _METHOD_ is localized to distinct structures with high _METHOD_ intensity in some cells . to gain an insight into the _METHOD_ localization we counterstained with which labels developing cell plates and followed the _PROTEIN_ localization in cells of the root meristem over time . an accumulation of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was associated with the appearance of the cell plate . during the centrifugal expansion of the cell plate to the parental cell walls the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ disappeared . _METHOD_ accumulation during early cell plate formation lasted s . when cell plate formation had completed _METHOD_ _METHOD_ started to accumulate at the division wall . the average residence time of _METHOD_ at the division wall was min _METHOD_ . thus _PROTEIN_ localization during cytokinesis is similar to the localization of other exocyst subunits .
