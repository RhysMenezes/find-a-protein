the freezing tolerance of arabidopsis thaliana is enhanced by cold acclimation resulting in changes in the compositions and function of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . here we show that a dynamin related protein _PROTEIN_ which is thought to function in the vesicle trafficking pathway in cells is related to an increase in freezing tolerance during cold acclimation . _PROTEIN_ accumulated in sphingolipid and sterol enriched _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ domains after cold acclimation . analysis of _PROTEIN_ mutants clearly showed that _PROTEIN_ is required for full development of freezing tolerance after cold acclimation . _PROTEIN_ fused with green _METHOD_ protein was visible as small foci that overlapped with _METHOD_ dye labelled _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ providing evidence that _PROTEIN_ localizes non uniformly in specific areas of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ accumulates in sphingolipid and sterol enriched _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ domains and plays a role in freezing tolerance development during cold acclimation .
previously we showed that some and subfamily proteins _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ accumulated in sphingolipid and sterol enriched _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ fractions isolated from cold acclimated arabidopsis seedlings . among these drps only _PROTEIN_ transcriptionally responded to low temperatures . to investigate changes in the transcript levels of all arabidopsis drp family genes during cold acclimation further we retrieved gene _PROTEIN_ data from the microarray database nascarrays . we selected the nascarrays data set because the growth and cold treatment conditions used to generate the data set were similar to our experimental conditions . among the drp genes _PROTEIN_ two genes in the subfamily and were transcriptionally induced in rosette leaves after treatment at for h or longer . _PROTEIN_ and appeared to respond to cold but the changes were not statistically significant . next we examined the tissue specificity of the and subfamily gene _PROTEIN_ using microarray data after normalization by rma at the arabidopsis _METHOD_ browser . _PROTEIN_ and were strongly _PROTEIN_ in leaves at all stages but and showed low _PROTEIN_ in leaves . was _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in mature pollen and the stamen at the flowering stage and was _PROTEIN_ in mature pollen . these results suggested that among the drp families _PROTEIN_ was a major cold responsive gene in mature leaves . to investigate the cold responsiveness of the _PROTEIN_ protein we generated an anti peptide antibody against _PROTEIN_ and carried out western blot analysis using _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and drm fractions isolated from week old arabidopsis leaves . cold treatment for days resulted in the accumulation of _PROTEIN_ in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ fraction especially in the drm fraction . chc which is a component of the ccp presumably together with dynamins was found exclusively in the drm and also accumulated after cold treatment although there were no changes in the transcript levels of two genes encoding arabidopsis chcs . for functional analysis of _PROTEIN_ in the cold acclimation of plants we isolated a _PROTEIN_ homozygous plant from t dna insertion line _PROTEIN_ in the arabidopsis col background . the _PROTEIN_ of the full length _PROTEIN_ gene increased in the wild type after a day cold treatment but no pcr fragments were amplified from the _PROTEIN_ either before or after cold treatment . immunoblotting analyses with the anti _PROTEIN_ antibody detected _PROTEIN_ as a kd protein in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ fraction from wild type plants but not from _PROTEIN_ . these results clearly show that there is no _PROTEIN_ of full length gene or protein in _PROTEIN_ . in addition there were no visible phenotypic differences between wild type and _PROTEIN_ plants when grown under normal growth conditions . next we used real time pcr analyses to examine the cold responsiveness in gene _PROTEIN_ of the subfamily in leaf tissues . _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ gene under non acclimated conditions was greater in _PROTEIN_ than in the wild type . however after cold acclimation the difference in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ between the wild type and _PROTEIN_ was cancelled because _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ gene in the wild type slightly increased after cold treatment . the _PROTEIN_ of the gene which is found _PROTEIN_ in flower tissues slightly _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ under non acclimated conditions but cold acclimation induced gene _PROTEIN_ in leaf tissues of both the wild type and _PROTEIN_ at the same level . we found no difference between the wild type and _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ either before or after cold acclimation . the extent of _PROTEIN_ during cold acclimation was similar in the wild type and _PROTEIN_ although cold acclimation slightly _PROTEIN_ its _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ increased four fold in the wild type after cold acclimation and the extent of the increase was far greater than that of other that are _PROTEIN_ in leaf tissues such as _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . these results indicated that deletion of _PROTEIN_ does not affect the _PROTEIN_ of other subfamily members significantly after cold acclimation . to confirm whether cold responsive _PROTEIN_ is associated with freezing tolerance in arabidopsis we determined the freezing tolerance of wild type and _PROTEIN_ plants using two types of freezing tolerance tests regrowth ability assay and electrolyte leakage assay . to test regrowth ability whole plants grown on murashige and skoog _METHOD_ agar medium were transferred to cooled test tubes and then frozen under controlled conditions at a cooling rate of per hour . after a freeze/thaw cycle plants were grown on soil at for days and then the number of plants with new leaves was counted to determine the survival rate . before cold acclimation the temperatures at which of plants were killed were not significantly different between the wild type and _PROTEIN_ plants . cold acclimation for days resulted in an increase in freezing tolerance in both plants but the wild type plants acquired significantly greater tolerance than the _PROTEIN_ plants . in addition we carried out the regrowth ability assay using another _PROTEIN_ mutant gabi line _PROTEIN_ . the of _PROTEIN_ before and after cold acclimation were and respectively . these results clearly demonstrated that during cold acclimation _PROTEIN_ plants were less capable of developing freezing tolerance than the wild type plants . next we further determined the extent of electrolyte leakage from detached leaves of plants grown on _METHOD_ agar medium after a freeze thaw cycle as an index of _LOCATION_ stability under freezing condition . in non acclimated plants the extent of electrolyte leakage was not significantly different between the wild type and _PROTEIN_ mutants at all temperatures tested . the temperatures for electrolyte leakages were and for wild type _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ respectively . after cold acclimation for days conversely the extent of electrolyte leakage from leaves of _PROTEIN_ mutants was greater than that of wild type leaves and of wild type _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were and respectively . taken together these freezing assays clearly showed that _PROTEIN_ had impaired development of freezing tolerance during cold acclimation because the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ is less stable in the mutant against freeze induced stresses than in wild type . to further confirm function of _PROTEIN_ in freezing tolerance we complemented the _PROTEIN_ mutant with _PROTEIN_ using the _PROTEIN_ coding region _PROTEIN_ under the native _PROTEIN_ promoter . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was confirmed in the transgenic arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ both before and after cold acclimation . the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in the _PROTEIN_ plant recovered the development of freezing tolerance during cold acclimation for days in regrowth ability survival of the complemented line _PROTEIN_ was similar to that of wild type plants after freezing and the was . when we determined electrolyte leakage from leaves after freezing the extent of leakage from the complemented line was less than that of _PROTEIN_ and of _PROTEIN_ was at the same level to that of wild type . interestingly when kept in a cold chamber for weeks leaves of _PROTEIN_ mutants turned to purple color suggesting that both _PROTEIN_ mutants are likely to accumulate anthocyanin after longer cold treatment . nevertheless because we do not observe any phenotypic differences in wild type and _PROTEIN_ mutants after a shorter period of cold acclimation there are no or little effects on differences in freezing tolerance between these plants under conditions we employed in this study . to determine the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ in cells we generated transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ under the control of the promoter _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ because green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ signals of the native promoter derived _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ were very weak in our microscope system . the anti _METHOD_ antibody recognized a single protein of approximately kd in the microsomal and _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ fractions isolated from the leaves of transgenic plants _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . immunoblot analysis using the anti _PROTEIN_ antibody showed that _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and native _PROTEIN_ were accumulated in _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ fractions of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ leaves . to biochemically confirm the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ a microsomal fraction from _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ leaves was fractionated by to linear sucrose density gradient centrifugation . immunoblot analysis revealed that both _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and native _PROTEIN_ were enriched in fractions and after the centrifugation . _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ aquaporins _PROTEIN_ which were used as _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ marker proteins were also detected in these fractions . these results implied that _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and native _PROTEIN_ were localized in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . next we observed _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in leaf protoplasts of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ using confocal _METHOD_ microscopy . interestingly the _METHOD_ foci of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ were localized as patchy areas of dot like structures on and in the close vicinity of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . when _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ leaf protoplasts were stained with to visualize the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and subsequently observed with a confocal _METHOD_ microscope labelled _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ overlapped with foci of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . moreover transient co _PROTEIN_ analysis of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mcherry a _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ marker protein that were introduced into tobacco leaf by agrobacterium mediated transformation showed that _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ foci overlapped with _PROTEIN_ mcherry signals at the cell surface . these results collectively indicated that _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ foci were non uniformly distributed at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . we then analyzed in detail the behavior of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ foci near the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ in root tissues of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . as in leaf protoplasts _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ signals in root tissues came from heterogeneously localized regions on the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and coincided with labelled _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . there were strong _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ signals at the cell plate in the division zone of the root . we also found that many _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ foci on the cell surface appeared and disappeared within short time intervals . the observation prompted us to analyze time lapse images of the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ foci on the cell surface . three images captured at approximately sec intervals were pseudocolored with three different colors and therefore the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ foci appeared as white dots in a merged image of the three pictures if they did not move within sec . however almost all foci were shown in different colors suggesting that many _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ foci moved dynamically within this period . in addition there was a random distribution to the colored foci in the merged image indicating that the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ foci did not move horizontally but appeared and disappeared from the cell surface . we observed that most of the _METHOD_ signals were near the cell surface while a few _METHOD_ foci were in cytoplasmic regions in the leaf protoplast . tang et al . reported that _PROTEIN_ was localized in mitochondria as determined by transient _PROTEIN_ analysis of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ although the abnormal mitochondrial phenotype caused by deletion of _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ by kang et al . and tang et al . . when we stained the mitochondria of root cells using mitotracker red however there did not seem to be any co localization of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ signals with mitotracker red derived signals .
