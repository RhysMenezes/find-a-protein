during leaf senescence chlorophyll is broken down to _METHOD_ chlorophyll catabolites . these arise from intermediary _METHOD_ chlorophyll catabolites by an acid catalyzed isomerization inside the _LOCATION_ . the chemical structures of nccs from arabidopsis indicate the presence of an enzyme activity that demethylates the _PROTEIN_ group present at the isocyclic _PROTEIN_ of chl . here we identified this activity as methylesterase family member _PROTEIN_ . during senescence _PROTEIN_ leaves exhibited a strong ultraviolet excitable _METHOD_ which resulted from large amounts of different fccs accumulating in the mutants . as confirmed by _METHOD_ _METHOD_ these fccs had an intact _PROTEIN_ group which slowed down their isomerization to respective nccs . like a homologous protein cloned from radish and named pheophorbidase _PROTEIN_ catalyzed the demethylation of pheophorbide an early intermediate of chl breakdown in vitro but _PROTEIN_ also demethylated an fcc . to determine the in vivo substrate of _PROTEIN_ we analyzed pheophorbide a _PROTEIN_ which is deficient in pheophorbide catabolism and accumulates pheophorbide in the chloroplast and a _PROTEIN_ double mutant . in the _PROTEIN_ background we additionally mistargeted _PROTEIN_ to the chloroplast . normally _PROTEIN_ localizes to the _LOCATION_ as shown by analysis of a _PROTEIN_ green _METHOD_ protein fusion . analysis of the accumulating pigments in these lines revealed that pheophorbide is only accessible for demethylation when _PROTEIN_ is targeted to the chloroplast . together these data demonstrate that _PROTEIN_ is an integral component of chl breakdown in arabidopsis and specifically demethylates chl catabolites at the level of fccs in the _LOCATION_ .
the distribution of _PROTEIN_ activity was shown to correlate with the occurrence of nccs harboring a free _PROTEIN_ group . for example all investigated brassicaceae species have _PROTEIN_ activity and demethylated fccs and nccs have been found in canola and arabidopsis indicating that _PROTEIN_ could be responsible for this site specific modification . a protein blast search of rsppd against the arabidopsis proteome uncovered high homology to members of the mes family of arabidopsis . thereby rsppd clustered with the members of subfamily as determined by citation with highest homology to _PROTEIN_ . the phylogenetic tree of figure includes further mes like est derived sequences from plant species for which ncc structures have been determined . the tree indicates that subfamily members of the mes protein family are indeed present in other brassicaceae species but also in barley and maize where evidence for hydrolysis of the methylester group at has not been provided . analysis of gene _PROTEIN_ patterns has proven successful in the past to identify potential chl catabolic enzymes . when analyzing microarray _PROTEIN_ data of the arabidopsis mes genes using the genevestigator tool _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ exhibited increased _PROTEIN_ levels in senescent leaves compared with green leaves . in addition using the _PROTEIN_ tool _PROTEIN_ was found in a network of coexpression with other chl catabolic genes . using semiquantitative reverse transcription pcr we confirmed the senescence regulated _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in the wild type upon dark induced senescence . thereby the _PROTEIN_ pattern was very similar to the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ is required for the initiation of chl breakdown and has been proposed to play a regulatory role in chl apoprotein complex destabilization . from this analysis _PROTEIN_ appeared to be the most likely candidate for demethylation in arabidopsis . to investigate its enzymatic activity recombinant _PROTEIN_ was produced in escherichia coli in fusion with an n terminal his tag . _PROTEIN_ was able to convert pheide a to pyro pheide a in a time dependent manner . as described for rsppd _PROTEIN_ most likely only catalyzed methylester hydrolysis of pheide a to desmethyl pheide a while the subsequent decarboxylation to pyro pheide a occurred spontaneously without the involvement of _PROTEIN_ however this was not analyzed in more detail . when pfcc was used as the substrate for recombinant _PROTEIN_ a new more _PROTEIN_ fcc peak appeared in reverse phase hplc which by _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ analysis _METHOD_ was identified as the demethylated form of pfcc . in contrast recombinant his tagged versions of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ the two other subfamily members and _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ the other senescence regulated mes proteins were unable to demethylate pfcc . as described for rsppd _PROTEIN_ was unable to demethylate cjncc an ncc isolated from senescent leaves of cercidiphyllum japonicum . _PROTEIN_ has been shown to hydrolyze meja and meiaa . to obtain insight into the substrate specificity of recombinant _PROTEIN_ we tested its pfcc esterase activity in the presence of fold molar excesses of meja meiaa and methyl salicylic acid or a fold molar excess of pheide a . as shown in figure under these conditions pfcc demethylation was only impaired to some extent by meiaa indicating that in vitro _PROTEIN_ has a high preference for an fcc as substrate . to investigate the in vivo role of _PROTEIN_ in relation to chl breakdown two independent t dna insertion lines named _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were obtained from the salk resource . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ analysis of these mutants indicated both alleles to represent true knockout mutants . the absence of full length _PROTEIN_ transcripts in these mutants did not affect the senescence regulated _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . the mutants did not show any phenotype during normal growth under either short day or long day conditions . when senescence was induced in the dark with detached leaves _PROTEIN_ mutants did not exhibit a dramatic stay green phenotype although compared with the wild type chl was significantly retained at a low level . when extracts of senescent leaves of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were analyzed for the presence of fccs and nccs using reverse phase hplc major differences were observed in comparison with wild type leaves . thus except for two peaks comigrating with pfcc and at ncc all fccs and nccs of the _PROTEIN_ mutants as detected by their typical _METHOD_ and/or absorption properties were likely novel chl catabolites not found before in arabidopsis . the three major fcc fractions tentatively named _PROTEIN_ fcc _PROTEIN_ fcc and _PROTEIN_ fcc and the major ncc fraction _PROTEIN_ were isolated from _PROTEIN_ and analyzed by _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . as seen in table i all analyzed catabolites possessed an intact _PROTEIN_ group . in addition the respective identities of _PROTEIN_ fcc and _PROTEIN_ ncc with pfcc and at ncc the only methylated catabolites detected in the wild type could be confirmed by _METHOD_ and hplc . to our surprise quantification of these catabolites revealed that both _PROTEIN_ lines accumulated significantly higher overall amounts of fcc and ncc . the reason for this higher quantity of chl catabolites in the mutants is unclear at present . moreover while the wild type almost exclusively accumulated nccs senescent _PROTEIN_ leaves contained high proportions of fccs . as a consequence senescent _PROTEIN_ leaves but not wild type leaves exhibited blue _METHOD_ when excited with uv light . intense _METHOD_ could also be observed in naturally senesced _PROTEIN_ leaves . to investigate whether the other mes subfamily members _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or other senescence regulated mes proteins _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ are involved in chl breakdown t dna insertion lines of respective genes were isolated and fccs and nccs were analyzed after dark induced senescence . none of these mutants exhibited a catabolite pattern that was different from the wild type . together with the above described absence of chl catabolite esterase activity of the respective recombinant proteins this result indicates that _PROTEIN_ acts nonredundantly toward the formation of chl catabolites that carry a free _PROTEIN_ acid function at . to analyze why _PROTEIN_ mutants accumulated rather high amounts of fccs we first investigated the subcellular localization of these chl catabolites . to this end chl catabolites extracted from isolated _LOCATION_ of senescent _PROTEIN_ leaf material were analyzed by reverse phase hplc and compared with the catabolites of protoplasts . the pattern of fccs and nccs was identical in the two fractions and given a rather low contamination of the _LOCATION_ fraction with extravacuolar compartments also the relative amounts of different catabolites were comparable between _LOCATION_ and protoplasts . the major difference between these two fractions was pfcc _PROTEIN_ which was absent from _LOCATION_ . this indicated that most of the fccs and nccs found in _PROTEIN_ accumulated in the _LOCATION_ sap as is known for wild type arabidopsis and other plant species . using confocal microscopy _LOCATION_ localization of _PROTEIN_ fccs was confirmed in senescent _PROTEIN_ leaves when excited with a nm laser mutant cells of the palisade mesophyll exhibited a strong blue _METHOD_ that covered the entire cellular space indicating _LOCATION_ origin . in contrast wild type mesophyll tissue only weakly fluoresced under these conditions . these data let us assume that the isomerization of fccs to nccs was compromised in _PROTEIN_ mutants . we speculated that this phenomenon could result from the possibility that the presence of an intact _PROTEIN_ group in the _PROTEIN_ fccs could affect the efficiency of their isomerization to the respective nccs . to test this we compared the rates of fcc to ncc isomerization at different ph values using either pfcc _PROTEIN_ or the product of its hydrolysis with recombinant _PROTEIN_ desmethyl pfcc . both fccs were converted to the respective nccs but the rates of isomerization differed considerably as judged from the half lives of the fcc substrates under the given ph conditions . thus both at ph and the conversion of desmethyl pfcc was about three times faster than that of pfcc . this delay of isomerization is likely at least in part responsible for the observed retention of fccs in the _PROTEIN_ mutants . a second possibility _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ was not experimentally tested here . lives of desmethyl pfcc and pfcc as shown above the absence of _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ mutants abolished the demethylation of chl catabolites as seen in the fccs and nccs the products of degradation . at the same time recombinant _PROTEIN_ was able to demethylate both pheide and pfcc . therefore the question arose what is the in vivo substrate of _PROTEIN_ ? to answer this we first investigated the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ by transiently _PROTEIN_ a _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein in wild type protoplasts and analyzing _METHOD_ _METHOD_ with confocal microscopy . similar to a free _METHOD_ control _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ localized to the _LOCATION_ . the integrity of the fusion protein was analyzed on immunoblots of transformed protoplasts using an anti _METHOD_ antiserum . this localization excluded pheide a as a likely substrate for _PROTEIN_ because _PROTEIN_ the exclusive pheide a catabolizing enzyme of higher plants has been localized to the chloroplast and export of pheide from senescent chloroplasts followed by reimport of desmethyl pheide is unlikely to occur . to confirm that the in vivo activity of _PROTEIN_ is restricted to the _LOCATION_ we mistargeted c terminally hemagglutinin tagged _PROTEIN_ to the chloroplast in transgenic ecotype columbia and _PROTEIN_ . to direct _PROTEIN_ ha to the chloroplast we n terminally fused it to the n terminal amino acids of arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ which represent the predicted chloroplast transit peptide of _PROTEIN_ . stroma localization of the chimeric construct _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in col _PROTEIN_ lines could be confirmed on immunoblots of protein extracts of protoplasts chloroplasts and subchloroplast fractions using anti ha antibodies . we then compared the patterns of accumulating pheide pigments in senescent leaves of the wild type _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ ha _PROTEIN_ and a _PROTEIN_ double mutant . while the wild type as expected was devoid of pheide a this chl breakdown intermediate accumulated to a similar extent in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . in contrast when targeting _PROTEIN_ to the chloroplast in the _PROTEIN_ background a large proportion of the accumulating pheide a had been converted to pyro pheide a . this result indicated that under natural conditions _PROTEIN_ does not have access to pheide a implying that the likely in vivo substrate of _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ is an fcc .
