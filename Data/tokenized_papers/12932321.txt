background in contrast to the intense attention devoted to research on intracellular sterol trafficking in animal cells knowledge about sterol transport in plant cells remains limited and virtually nothing is known about plant endocytic sterol trafficking . similar to animals biosynthetic sterol transport occurs from the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ via the _LOCATION_ apparatus to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . the vesicle trafficking inhibitor brefeldin a has been suggested to disrupt biosynthetic sterol transport at the _LOCATION_ level . results here we report on early endocytic sterol trafficking in arabidopsis root epidermal cells by introducing filipin as a tool for _METHOD_ sterol detection . sterols can be internalized from the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and localize to endosomes positive for the early endosomal _PROTEIN_ homolog _PROTEIN_ fused to green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . early endocytic sterol transport is actin dependent and highly bfa sensitive . bfa causes coaccumulation of sterols endocytic markers like _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ a _PROTEIN_ localized presumptive auxin transport protein in early endosome agglomerations that can be distinguished from _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ . sterol accumulation in such aggregates is enhanced in mutants and the actin depolymerizing drug cytochalasin d inhibits sterol redistribution from endosome aggregations . conclusions early endocytic sterol trafficking involves transport via _PROTEIN_ positive early endosomes that in contrast to animal cells is actin dependent . our results reveal sterol enriched early endosomes as targets for bfa interference in plants . early endocytic sterol trafficking and recycling of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ protein share a common pathway suggesting a connection between plant endocytic sterol transport and _PROTEIN_ sorting events .
in animal cells the sterol binding antibiotic filipin is routinely used for _METHOD_ and ultrastructural detection of free cholesterol citation . by modifying protocols for cholesterol localization we established filipin as a probe for _METHOD_ detection of plant hydroxysterols . filipin specifically detected hydroxysterols on blots and in arabidopsis roots . subsequently we analyzed sterol distributions in epidermal cells by colocalizing filipin sterol _METHOD_ with green or yellow _METHOD_ proteins _METHOD_ _METHOD_ targeted to different organelles citation . as a pm marker we employed enhanced _METHOD_ _METHOD_ fused to the low temperature inducible protein _PROTEIN_ citation a member of a family of conserved small integral pm proteins citation . arabidopsis encodes a functional homolog of yeast originally purified as a pm proteolipid citation . filipin sterol _METHOD_ was predominantly observed at the cell periphery where it colabeled with _METHOD_ . at the ultrastructural level filipin sterol complexes formed characteristic nm protruberances at the pm citation . filipin sterol _METHOD_ also accumulated in intracellular compartments citation . we observed little overlap between sterols and the distribution of _LOCATION_ targeted proteins such as _METHOD_ _LOCATION_ and _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . similarly little colabeling of sterols was found with _LOCATION_ targeted n acetylglucosaminyl transferase i citation fused to _METHOD_ _METHOD_ citation . as a second _LOCATION_ marker we utilized rat n sialyltransferase fused to _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . in arabidopsis roots rat sialyltransferase localizes to cisternae and _LOCATION_ of the trans side of the _LOCATION_ citation and a _METHOD_ protein fusion localizes to the trans side of _LOCATION_ stacks in tobacco citation . sterols partially colabeled with n _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ citation . similarly we observed partial overlap of filipin sterol _METHOD_ and the early endosomal homolog _PROTEIN_ fused to _METHOD_ citation . consistently _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ fusions of two other homologs _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ partially colabeled with filipin sterol _METHOD_ in protoplasts and this colocalization pattern is reminiscent of filipin cholesterol colocalization with _METHOD_ in animal cells citation . our results demonstrate that arabidopsis sterols are abundant in the pm and may also localize to the trans _LOCATION_ . furthermore they reveal _PROTEIN_ positive early endosomes as novel sterol enriched compartments in plants . to analyze sterol internalization we pulse labeled live arabidopsis roots _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ with filipin and examined epidermal cells for filipin sterol _METHOD_ . subsequent to filipin labeling and wash out filipin sterol _METHOD_ occurred at the pm citation . after min of incubation in filipin free medium sterol _METHOD_ appeared in internal compartments while steady state _METHOD_ localization remained unaffected citation . these findings suggest that sterols are internalized in the arabidopsis root epidermis and support that endocytic sterol trafficking occurs in plant cells . we next analyzed bfa effects on sterol trafficking in the arabidopsis root epidermis . in epidermal cells bfa caused strong coaccumulation of sterols and _METHOD_ in discrete subcellular compartments as early as min after application . similarly _METHOD_ rapidly colabeled with the endocytosis marker in bfa induced compartments citation . these results suggest that sterol enriched bfa compartments contain early endosomes . consistent with this view _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ partially colabeled with sterols in bfa induced structures citation . under the same conditions sterol containing compartments did not accumulate _LOCATION_ targeted proteins citation . notably early bfa induced sterol compartments could be distinguished from the _LOCATION_ . both _LOCATION_ markers n _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ citation and nag _METHOD_ citation _PROTEIN_ localized to multiple discrete punctate structures that surrounded sterol containing compartments and likely represented individual _LOCATION_ stacks . a low degree of colabeling between n _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and sterols however was observed in sterol containing structures and suggests that some trans _LOCATION_ material may contribute to sterol containing bfa compartments . consistent with these results ultrastructural analyses revealed that bfa induced agglomeration of a mixed vesicle population that contained only some trans _LOCATION_ derived material was devoid of _LOCATION_ and was surrounded by _LOCATION_ stacks . together our findings suggest that bfa induces agglomeration of sterol containing vesicles that partially represent early endosomes . we further examined whether components in bfa compartments derive from the pm by double pulse labeling plants that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ with filipin and . all three components colabeled in the center of bfa compartments citation demonstrating that sterol and positive material in these structures derives from the pm . to establish the fate of pm proteins accumulating in bfa compartments we analyzed trafficking of newly synthesized _METHOD_ under bfa treatment by _METHOD_ recovery after photobleaching . after bleaching of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ de novo synthesized protein rapidly reappeared at the pm while recovery in bfa compartments occurred with an approximate min delay citation . by contrast bfa did not significantly influence frap of _METHOD_ at the pm when compared to samples that were not treated with the inhibitor . thus bfa does not primarily affect _METHOD_ targeting to the pm but rather a _PROTEIN_ trafficking step likely to involve endocytosis . we addressed whether _METHOD_ in bfa compartments derived from the pm rather than from a biosynthetic pathway . application of cycloheximide did not obviously influence steady state levels of _METHOD_ at the pm citation but it effectively inhibited frap of _METHOD_ . these findings suggest that biosynthesis does not strongly contribute to the pm pool of this protein at steady state and they indicate that it is not rapidly degraded . chx preincubation and the subsequent addition of bfa did not obviously influence accumulation of _METHOD_ in bfa compartments citation . thus similar to _PROTEIN_ in vascular cells citation accumulation of _METHOD_ in epidermal bfa compartments occurred largely independent of protein biosynthesis . since pm derived sterols and _METHOD_ rapidly colocalized with early endosomal markers upon bfa treatment our data strongly suggest that bfa interferes with early endocytic sterol trafficking . to elucidate cytoskeletal requirements of endocytic sterol trafficking we examined the effects of actin and tubulin inhibitors on subcellular sterol distributions . application of the tubulin depolymerizing drugs oryzalin or nocodazole did not affect subcellular sterol distributions in elongating cells . by contrast application of the actin depolymerizing drug cytochalasin d caused sterol accumulation in small intracellular compartments . these differed by their higher number and smaller size from bfa induced endosome agglomerations but similarly coaccumulated sterols and _METHOD_ citation . frap analysis of roots pretreated with cytd revealed _METHOD_ recovery of _METHOD_ at the pm while hardly any recovery was observed in intracellular compartments citation . these results indicate a strong cytd effect on the endocytic pathway of the sterol colocalizing pm protein . together our results suggest that early endocytic sterol and _METHOD_ trafficking require the actin _LOCATION_ . we further examined whether interference with the actin _LOCATION_ affects trafficking of sterol containing early endosomes . application of cytd caused coaccumulation of sterols and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ citation as well as colocalization of and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in cytd induced compartments . these findings suggest that sterol enriched cytd compartments contain early endosomes . additionally some sterol or containing cytd compartments coaccumulated _LOCATION_ markers indicating that cytd treatment causes agglomeration or partial fusion of early endosomes and the _LOCATION_ . these results suggest that similar to transport of _LOCATION_ stacks citation trafficking of sterol enriched early endosomes requires the actin _LOCATION_ . we investigated whether sterols can redistribute from endosomal aggregates . to this end we examined the reversibility of sterol accumulation after inhibitor treatment and found that the effects of even prolonged incubation with either cytd or bfa were reversible after drug wash out . application of cytd after bfa treatment and wash out inhibited sterol redistribution from bfa compartments citation and this inhibition suggests that sterol redistribution from endosomes requires the actin _LOCATION_ . we further studied the actin dependence of endocytic sterol trafficking by analyzing sterol distributions in deformed root hairs _PROTEIN_ mutants defective in the _PROTEIN_ gene citation . _PROTEIN_ mutants represent partial loss of function _PROTEIN_ alleles that display root epidermal _PROTEIN_ defects citation . in _PROTEIN_ alleles sterol distribution and internalization appeared normal . by contrast all three _PROTEIN_ alleles were hypersensitive to treatment with bfa for min . bfa induced formation of large sterol positive compartments in _PROTEIN_ mutants _PROTEIN_ that are clearly distinct from the higher number of small punctate structures in bfa treated wild type cells citation . similarly bfa differentially affected internalization and distribution in wild type citation and _PROTEIN_ epidermal cells citation . consistent with _PROTEIN_ mutant phenotypes in epidermal differentiation citation differences in sterol and distribution were observed in elongating and differentiated _PROTEIN_ epidermal cells citation . the hypersensitivity of _PROTEIN_ mutants to bfa induced sterol and accumulation suggests that is required for normal sterol distribution and early endocytic trafficking . the defects observed in _PROTEIN_ closely resemble the effects of actin inhibitors on sterol redistribution from endosome agglomerations . these findings further support an actin requirement during redistribution events in early endocytic sterol trafficking . the cytoskeletal and vesicle transport requirements for early endocytic sterol trafficking resembled those described for _PROTEIN_ recycling in vascular cells citation . however the pm localization of another presumptive auxin transporter the auxin influx carrier _PROTEIN_ can be modified by bfa treatment citation . to address whether endocytic sterol trafficking is regulated by _METHOD_ similar to those governing the transport of _PROTEIN_ or aux proteins we examined sterol distributions in double labeling experiments with antibodies against epidermally _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ citation and hemagglutinin epitope tagged _PROTEIN_ protein citation . sterols colabeled with _PROTEIN_ and ha _PROTEIN_ at the pm of untreated epidermal cells . _PROTEIN_ and ha _PROTEIN_ displayed their expected pm localizations toward the apical end or with a preferential apical basal orientation respectively citation citation . upon short term bfa treatment sterols colabeled with _PROTEIN_ in endosomal vesicle agglomerations while _PROTEIN_ only partially _PROTEIN_ its apical localization at the pm citation . under the same conditions ha _PROTEIN_ localization remained unaffected . extending the application period to hr at bfa caused almost complete loss of apical _PROTEIN_ from the pm and strong colabeling with sterols in bfa compartments citation . under the same conditions ha _PROTEIN_ localization appeared more diffuse and depolarized when compared to untreated epidermal cells but no distinct colocalization with sterols was observed in bfa induced structures citation . our findings demonstrate that bfa affects _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ localization of diverse pm proteins with different efficiency and specificity . they suggest that early endocytic sterol trafficking and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ protein recycling follow a common bfa sensitive endocytic pathway .
