the vanilla _PROTEIN_ albino mutant is defective in a gene encoding a chloroplast localized pentatricopeptide repeat protein of the dyw subgroup . however the _PROTEIN_ terminal dyw motif is truncated in _PROTEIN_ . to identify _PROTEIN_ specific phenotypes we compared chloroplast rna editing sites and chloroplast gene _PROTEIN_ patterns among wild type _PROTEIN_ and another albino mutant _PROTEIN_ which is defective in the _LOCATION_ isoprenoid biosynthesis pathway . we found that the editing of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ transcripts is partially affected in _PROTEIN_ . in addition steady state levels of chloroplast rrnas are significantly _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ of _LOCATION_ encoded rna polymerase transcribed genes is down regulated whereas the _PROTEIN_ of _LOCATION_ encoded rna polymerase transcribed genes is up regulated in _PROTEIN_ . although the development and function of mutant chloroplasts are severely impaired steady state mrna levels of _LOCATION_ encoded photosynthetic genes are not affected or are only slightly _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ gene encodes a transcription _PROTEIN_ and its _PROTEIN_ is down regulated by norflurazon treatment in wild type . this norflurazon effect was not observed in _PROTEIN_ . these results suggest that the _PROTEIN_ protein may be involved in _LOCATION_ to _LOCATION_ retrograde signaling in addition to its role in chloroplast rna editing and gene _PROTEIN_ . a defect in a key biosynthetic pathway can have many indirect effects on chloroplast gene _PROTEIN_ as is seen in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . similarly the _PROTEIN_ mutant has pleiotropic molecular phenotypes and most of which may be indirect effects .
to isolate mutants impaired in chloroplast development and function we generated a collection of arabidopsis t dna insertion lines and screened for plants displaying albino pale green or pale yellow phenotypes . one of the isolated mutants vanilla _PROTEIN_ exhibits albino to pale yellow phenotype . homozygous _PROTEIN_ plants are albino lethal so the mutant is _PROTEIN_ as a heterozygous line . progeny from a self pollinated heterozygous plant segregate green and albino plants in a ratio of on a half _METHOD_ plus sucrose medium i.e . the albino phenotype is inherited as a monogenic recessive mutation . the _PROTEIN_ albino plants are lethal under either normal or low light condition . some _PROTEIN_ albino plants can grow to develop flower bud like structures on a tissue culture medium . however these flower buds never grow to mature before the plant dies . in week old _PROTEIN_ mutants total chlorophylls and carotenoids are and respectively of the amounts in wild type plants . in contrast the content of photosynthetic pigments was almost undetectable in the _PROTEIN_ albino plants which are null mutants of the _PROTEIN_ gene encoding hrdroxy methyl butenyl diphosphate reductase _PROTEIN_ of the _LOCATION_ nonmevalonate pathway for isoprenoid biosynthesis . in parallel with their photosynthetic pigment content the psii maximum quantum yield of _PROTEIN_ mutants was about of wild type plants whereas the photosynthetic activity was not detectable in the _PROTEIN_ albino plants . transmission electron microscopic analysis of _PROTEIN_ leaf sections revealed that the development of chloroplast is impaired in the mutant . in contrast to wild type chloroplasts which are lens shaped containing well organized inner _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ the morphology of _PROTEIN_ mutant chloroplasts range from round or amoeboid shape and completely lack of _LOCATION_ to lens shaped with the development of few stacking and non stacking _LOCATION_ . these various types of mutant chloroplasts may exist in the same or different cells . the mutant chloroplasts without _LOCATION_ are usually filled with large vesicles . in addition densely stained globule aggregates are frequently observed in the _PROTEIN_ mutant chloroplasts . these observations are consistent with the phenotypes that the _PROTEIN_ mutants still retain certain amounts of photosynthetic pigments and some photosynthetic activity . genetic analysis of the _PROTEIN_ mutants has confirmed that the albino phenotype co segregates with the t dna insertion . to identify the _PROTEIN_ locus we used thermal asymmetric interlaced pcr to analyze the genomic flanking sequence of the _PROTEIN_ t dna mutant . sequence analysis of the tail pcr products revealed that the t dna insertion is located in the open reading frame of _GENE_ . rna gel blot analysis confirmed that kb transcripts of the predicted _GENE_ gene were detected in the wild type but not in the _PROTEIN_ albino plants . since the rna gel blot analysis can not detect very low abundant transcripts we conducted rt pcr analysis to show that there is no trace of _PROTEIN_ transcripts left in the mutant . these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ is a null allele of the _GENE_ gene . to further prove that we have identified the allele responsible for the _PROTEIN_ albino mutant we introduced a kb genomic clone encompassing the predicted open reading frame of the _PROTEIN_ gene and its putative promoter into the mutant . the _PROTEIN_ gene driven by its own native promoter was able to complement the _PROTEIN_ albino mutant . the phenotype and genotype of a representative complementation line are shown in fig . and e respectively . these results confirm that the _PROTEIN_ albino phenotype is caused by a loss of function mutation in the _PROTEIN_ gene . is an intronless gene that encodes a _PROTEIN_ protein . the amino acid sequence and domain composition of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ protein are most similar to those in the dyw subgroup . however the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ protein has a truncated dyw domain . the other reported _PROTEIN_ dyw proteins end with a conserved dyw or dfw tri peptide . the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ protein is predicted to localize to the chloroplast . to verify the prediction we fused the first amino acids of _PROTEIN_ protein which encompass the putative transit peptide to the n terminus of a green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ . the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion construct driven by a cauliflower mosaic virus promoter was transformed into arabidopsis protoplasts . confocal microscopy was used to observe the _METHOD_ signals h after transformation . the green _METHOD_ signals derived from the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein co localized with the auto _METHOD_ signals of chlorophylls in the chloroplasts . these results suggest that the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ protein is localized to the chloroplast . we used semi quantitative rt pcr analysis to examine the _PROTEIN_ patterns of _PROTEIN_ in week old wild type arabidopsis plants grown in soil . the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ is ubiquitous as the _PROTEIN_ transcripts were detected in all organs examined . levels of _PROTEIN_ transcripts are low in roots and high in leaves _METHOD_ flowers and siliques . to test the effects of light on the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ we treated day old arabidopsis etiolated seedlings with light for and h. total rna extracted from these samples was analyzed by semi quantitative rt pcr to detect the _PROTEIN_ levels of _PROTEIN_ . low levels of _PROTEIN_ mrna were detected in day old etiolated arabidopsis seedlings . exposure to light for h rapidly increased the accumulation of _PROTEIN_ transcripts and higher levels of _PROTEIN_ mrna were detected in seedlings treated by light for and h . many chloroplast protein coding genes are organized as clusters and are co transcribed as polycistronic messages . the _PROTEIN_ of these polycistronic genes has to go through extensive posttranscriptional processing . to further identify _PROTEIN_ specific molecular phenotypes we used rna gel blot analysis to compare the abundance and banding patterns of chloroplast transcripts in wild type _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants . the psb genes encode subunits of the photosystem ii protein complex and the pet genes encode subunits of the photoelectron transport cytochrome protein complex . compared to those of wild type steady state levels of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and psbz mrnas are significantly _PROTEIN_ in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . these effects are specific to the _PROTEIN_ albino mutants because the _PROTEIN_ of most of the psb genes is only slightly affected in the _PROTEIN_ albino plants . in addition to the difference in transcript levels the banding patterns of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ transcripts in _PROTEIN_ are different from those of wild type and _PROTEIN_ . the intensity of each individual band of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ transcripts is differentially regulated in _PROTEIN_ compared to those of wild type and _PROTEIN_ . although the abundance of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ transcripts is significantly _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ at least three unique high molecular weight _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ transcripts were specifically detected in _PROTEIN_ but not in wild type and _PROTEIN_ . these results suggest that the abundance and _PROTEIN_ patterns of chloroplast psb transcripts are significantly and specifically affected in the _PROTEIN_ albino mutant . the psa genes encode subunits of the photosystem i protein complex . the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ genes are co transcribed in the same operon . compared to those of wild type steady state levels of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ transcripts are significantly _PROTEIN_ in both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ albino mutants . these results suggest that the down regulation of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ transcripts is not specific to the _PROTEIN_ mutant . the ndh genes encode subunits of the nadh dehydrogenase . the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ genes are located in the same operon . compared to those of wild type and _PROTEIN_ steady state levels of high molecular weight precursor transcripts of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ are specifically up regulated in the _PROTEIN_ albino mutant . in contrast to _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ patterns of most ndh genes are similar between the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ albino mutants . compared to those of wild type levels of _PROTEIN_ transcripts are slightly _PROTEIN_ in both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants . by contrast steady state levels of _PROTEIN_ mrnas are specifically down regulated in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . whereas the abundance and _PROTEIN_ patterns of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and petl transcripts are similar between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ albino mutants steady state levels of petn mrna are significantly _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ compared to those of wild type and _PROTEIN_ . the chloroplast atp genes are organized into two transcriptional units in arabidopsis . one cluster of genes has the order _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and the other cluster has the order _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . we designed probes corresponding to the coding regions of these chloroplast encoded _PROTEIN_ synthase subunit genes to detect the abundance and banding patterns of these polycistronic transcripts by rna gel blot analyses . we found that the _PROTEIN_ patterns of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ transcripts are specifically affected in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ operon and kb transcripts are transcribed by _PROTEIN_ and nep respectively . in the _PROTEIN_ mutant steady state levels of nep transcribed kb _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ transcripts are increased compared to those of wild type and _PROTEIN_ whereas the _PROTEIN_ transcribed kb _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ transcripts are almost undetectable . moreover there are at least two additional high molecular weight _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ transcripts that specifically accumulate in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . we used sense and antisense probes located in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ operon and its adjacent gene _PROTEIN_ to demonstrate that these high molecular weight transcripts in _PROTEIN_ have the same orientation as _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ transcripts . in contrast to the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ transcripts the _PROTEIN_ patterns of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ are similar to those of _PROTEIN_ . compared to those of wild type steady state levels of _PROTEIN_ transcripts are significantly _PROTEIN_ in both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ albino mutants whereas the abundance of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ transcripts is not affected . the _LOCATION_ encoded rna polymerase consists and subunits which are encoded by the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ genes respectively . compared to those of wild type and _PROTEIN_ steady state levels of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ transcripts are increased in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . similarly steady state levels of clpp transcripts are specifically up regulated in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . in addition a novel low molecular weight clpp transcript was specifically detected in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . the rps and rpl genes encode ribosomal proteins of small and large subunits respectively . the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ gene is split into two parts which belong to two different operons in the chloroplast genome . the and _PROTEIN_ transcripts have to go through trans splicing to form mature transcripts . compared to those of wild type and _PROTEIN_ steady state levels of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are significantly increased in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ genes are located in the same operon . similar to that of _PROTEIN_ steady state levels of _PROTEIN_ transcripts are specifically down regulated in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . the _PROTEIN_ levels of the other rps and rpl genes are similar between the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ albino mutants . the ycf genes encode proteins of unknown functions in the chloroplast . compared to those of wild type and _PROTEIN_ steady state levels of and transcripts are specifically increased in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . moreover the _PROTEIN_ patterns and the intensity of each individual band of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ transcripts in _PROTEIN_ are significantly different from those of wild type and _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ gene encodes the subunit of acetyl coa _PROTEIN_ . steady state levels of _PROTEIN_ transcripts are _PROTEIN_ in both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . the chloroplast rrna genes are organized as a operon similar to that of prokaryotes . ethidium bromide staining of total rna extracted from weeks old _PROTEIN_ albino plants reveals that levels of chloroplast ribosomal rna are significantly reduced in the _PROTEIN_ albino mutant compared to that of wild type and _PROTEIN_ . we used rna gel blot analysis to examine the _PROTEIN_ patterns and steady state levels of and rrnas in wild type _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants . compared to those of wild type and _PROTEIN_ steady state levels of and rrnas are significantly _PROTEIN_ in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . despite the dramatic difference in transcript abundance the banding patterns of chloroplast and rrnas in _PROTEIN_ are similar to those of wild type and _PROTEIN_ . these results suggest that steady state levels of chloroplast rrnas are specifically affected in the _PROTEIN_ mutant but not in the _PROTEIN_ albino plants . in addition to rrnas we also used rna gel blot analysis to examine the _PROTEIN_ of chloroplast trna genes . it has been suggested that the _PROTEIN_ of chloroplast _PROTEIN_ gene is dependent on _PROTEIN_ and trnaglu can specifically repress the activity of nep during the _PROTEIN_ phase of chloroplast development . compared to those of wild type steady state levels of _PROTEIN_ transcripts are slightly _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ and dramatically reduced in _PROTEIN_ . similarly steady state levels of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ trnr trnt _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ transcripts are also significantly _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ . by contrast steady state levels of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ trnl _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and trnv transcripts are _PROTEIN_ to similar levels in both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ compared to those of wild type . ribulose bisphosphate _PROTEIN_ the key enzyme of photosynthetic _PROTEIN_ fixation is composed of large and small subunits which are encoded by _PROTEIN_ in the chloroplast and rbcs in the _LOCATION_ respectively . compared to those of wild type and _PROTEIN_ steady state levels of _PROTEIN_ transcripts are significantly _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ . by contrast steady state levels of rbcs transcripts are not affected in _PROTEIN_ but are significantly _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ . similarly compared to those of wild type steady state levels of cab transcripts are only slightly reduced in _PROTEIN_ but are dramatically _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ mutants are albino lethal which only retain limited ability in photosynthesis . it is unexpected to observe that the amounts of rbcs and cab transcripts are not or only slightly affected in the _PROTEIN_ albino plants . we further examined the _PROTEIN_ levels of several _LOCATION_ encoded psa and psb genes in wild type _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants by northern blot analysis . interestingly the results are very similar to those of rbcs and cab . compared to those of wild type steady state levels of psad psae _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ psbo psbp _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ transcripts are not or only slightly affected in _PROTEIN_ but are significantly _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ . norflurazon is a phytoene desaturase inhibitor that will block the synthesis of carotenoids . the signaling pathways involved in nf initiated _LOCATION_ to _LOCATION_ retrograde regulation of cab and rbcs genes have been established . to examine if the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ protein is involved in _LOCATION_ to _LOCATION_ retrograde regulation we used nf to treat wild type _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ albino plants . six days old wild type arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ plants grown under normal condition were transferred to medium with or without nf for days . total rna extracted from these samples was subject to northern blot analysis to examine the _PROTEIN_ of retrograde regulated genes cab rbcs _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . after nf treatment steady state levels of _PROTEIN_ mrna are _PROTEIN_ in wild type and _PROTEIN_ . interestingly this nf initiated retrograde regulation of _PROTEIN_ does not exist in _PROTEIN_ . instead of down regulation steady state mrna levels of _PROTEIN_ are significantly increased in _PROTEIN_ after nf treatment . by contrast steady state levels of cab rbcs and _PROTEIN_ mrnas are further _PROTEIN_ in both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ albino mutants after nf treatment . these results suggest that the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ protein may be required for the specific retrograde regulation of _PROTEIN_ initiated by nf treatment . we used rt pcr and bulk sequencing of the amplified cdnas to examine all chloroplast rna editing sites in week old wild type _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants . we found that the editing of two sites in _PROTEIN_ and one site in _PROTEIN_ was significantly reduced in _PROTEIN_ . one of the _PROTEIN_ editing sites is located at the nucleotide from the aug of the _PROTEIN_ mrna . c to u editing at this position results in an amino acid change . the other _PROTEIN_ editing site is located in the . in _PROTEIN_ c to u editing at the nucleotide from the aug leads to an amino acid change . to determine the editing efficiency of these sites we cloned the rt pcr products and randomly sequenced independent clones from each sample . compared to that of wild type the editing efficiency of these three sites was significantly _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ and was only slightly reduced in _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ editing site is and edited in wild type _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ respectively . the editing of _PROTEIN_ site is partial in wild type and _PROTEIN_ but is dramatically reduced in _PROTEIN_ . similarly the editing efficiency of _PROTEIN_ site is and in wild type _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ respectively . finding obtained here that the editing of _PROTEIN_ site is partially impaired in _PROTEIN_ is different from its allelic mutant _PROTEIN_ . we obtained the _PROTEIN_ line from the arabidopsis biological resource center _PROTEIN_ and examined the editing of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ sites in the albino plants . our results indicate that the editing profiles of these sites in _PROTEIN_ are very similar to those of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . by comparing the editing profiles among wt _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ we have identified several rna editing sites that are specifically affected in the _PROTEIN_ albino mutant . these rna editing sites are located in clpp _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ transcripts . in addition the editing of _PROTEIN_ petl _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ is reduced to similar levels in both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ albino mutants . the profiles of the other rna editing sites are similar among wild type _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ .

hybridization hybridization wash conditions and detection were performed according to roche s dig application manual for filter hybridization . for rt pcr analysis total rna was isolated from various

genomic southern . six of the green hygromycinr primary transformants tested were _PROTEIN_ homozygous . in the generation about seeds from each line were germinated on a hygromycin selective medium and all hygromycinr seedlings were green an indication that the _PROTEIN_ genomic clone complements the albino phenotype in all lines . genotypic and phenotypic characterizations of line a representative homozygous line for the _PROTEIN_ transgene and _PROTEIN_ locus are shown in fig . d. the computer program chlorop predicts that the length of _PROTEIN_ transit peptide is amino acids .
