to obtain a global overview of how mitochondria respond to stress we aimed to define the plant mitochondrial stress response _METHOD_ . by combining a set of arabidopsis thaliana genes that putatively encode mitochondrial proteins with microarray experiments on stress related conditions _LOCATION_ encoded genes were defined as widely stress responsive . using green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ fusion assays the mitochondrial targeting of a large number of these proteins was tested confirming in total proteins as mitochondrially targeted . several of these proteins were observed to be dual targeted to mitochondria and _LOCATION_ including the small heat shock proteins and . in addition to the well defined stress components of mitochondria such as alternative oxidases nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide h dehydrogenases and heat shock proteins a variety of other proteins many with unknown function were identified . the mitochondrial carrier protein family was over represented in the stress responsive genes suggesting that stress induces altered needs for metabolite transport across the mitochondrial inner _LOCATION_ . although the genes encoding many of these proteins contain common cis acting regulatory elements it was apparent that a number of distinct regulatory processes or signals likely triggered the _METHOD_ . therefore these genes provide new model _METHOD_ to study mitochondrial retrograde regulation in addition to the widely used alternative oxidase model . additionally as changes in proteins responsive to stress did not correlate well with changes at a transcript level it suggests that post transcriptional _METHOD_ also play an important role in defining the _METHOD_ .
the aim of this study was to identify genes coding for mitochondrial proteins that were responsive to a wide array of stress conditions . therefore a bipartite approach was undertaken first to identify genes that putatively encode mitochondrial proteins and second to identify which of these genes respond significantly to a variety of stress conditions using publicly available high quality microarray datasets . to obtain a comprehensive list of arabidopsis thaliana genes coding for mitochondrially located proteins we queried the _PROTEIN_ cellular location database of arabidopsis proteins _PROTEIN_ for proteins that were predicted or experimentally shown to be located in mitochondria . prediction yielded genes that putatively encode mitochondrial proteins while experimental approaches using _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ or green _METHOD_ protein tagging _METHOD_ yielded and genes respectively . together they produced a non redundant set of genes putatively encoding mitochondrial proteins for which probe sets are present on the affymetrix _PROTEIN_ genechip . some of the _PROTEIN_ probe sets can detect more than one highly similar gene product so the genes were covered by probe sets indicating a relatively low rate of probe set redundancy . a full list of the selected genes is shown in . the second step was to make a selection of high quality arabidopsis microarray datasets that covered a range of different conditions that impose or are related to stress conditions . based on a number of marker genes encoding mitochondrial proteins for which a widespread stress responsiveness had been demonstrated in the past such as _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ the web tool genevestigator was used to browse publicly available microarray datasets . this led to the selection of experiments related to abiotic stress conditions ros treatment chemical inhibitors and hormone related treatments . raw data files for these experiments were collected and normalized . additionally ros related datasets from catalase deficient mutants treated with high light and a chloroplastic cu/zn sod mutant were collected as these had been used previously to define hallmarks of responses to oxidative stress . in total different _PROTEIN_ datasets were collected some of which were single comparisons to control while some were more elaborate time course experiments . after normalization and statistical analysis the profiles of the probe sets that detect _PROTEIN_ of the putatively mitochondrial proteins were compiled . a probe set was defined as differentially responsive in a specific experiment when its _PROTEIN_ was significantly changed and the proportion of change was at least two fold . almost of the probe sets were responsive in at least one of the conditions while about one in three probe sets was responsive in multiple conditions . our objective was to obtain a list of genes coding for mitochondrial proteins that were responsive to a wide range of stresses so a final selection of probe sets that were responsive in at least half of the conditions was retained _PROTEIN_ . the most widely responsive genes were annotated as a _PROTEIN_ like aaa type _PROTEIN_ an _PROTEIN_ protein _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ that were responsive to out of conditions . note that no transcripts from mitochondrially encoded proteins were found to be widely stress responsive . however as labeling of rna for detection of transcript abundance involves oligo dt primers and poly adenylation is not a normal feature of mitochondrial transcripts though it can signal degradation it is not unexpected that they were not detected adequately using this approach . furthermore transcript abundance for mitochondrially located genes has been proposed to be regulated by post transcriptional _METHOD_ such as splicing editing and translation . the gene _PROTEIN_ patterns demonstrated in this study were obtained from various experiments under different growth conditions and developmental stages and further validation of stress induced changes in transcript will be a valuable confirmation . nevertheless for several of the genes identified in this study stress induced _PROTEIN_ has been reported extensively in other studies by quantitative pcr methods underlining the validity of the microarray data . as for over half of the proteins the putative mitochondrial location is based on prediction alone where accuracy compared to experimental approaches can be less than it was necessary to verify their predicted mitochondrial localization . furthermore a mitochondrial location determined by sub cellular proteomics approaches may still contain some non mitochondrial proteins due to contamination with other cellular compartments _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ . to validate the mitochondrial location of the proteins for which the mitochondrial localization was not experimentally determined by two approaches or generally accepted due to detailed biochemical studies _METHOD_ localization assays were performed for proteins _PROTEIN_ . coding sequences were amplified from arabidopsis cdna and cloned into _METHOD_ fusion vectors . we were unable to amplify the corresponding cdna for a mitochondrial carrier family protein . for all genes c terminal _METHOD_ fusions were constructed _METHOD_ and in specific cases also n terminal fusions _METHOD_ . the _METHOD_ fusion vectors were then transformed into arabidopsis cell culture cells and onion epidermal cells together with an _PROTEIN_ transit peptide red _METHOD_ protein _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion construct as mitochondrial marker for co localization in arabidopsis cell culture . in summary for out of proteins a mitochondrial location could be confirmed while other proteins were found to be located in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ and endomembrane system protein kinases and _PROTEIN_ protein _PROTEIN_ and . for a mitochondrial carrier family protein _METHOD_ targeting in mitochondria could only be found for the splice variant . note that in the case of the mitochondrial substrate carrier family protein it has recently also been shown to be located in _LOCATION_ in an independent study . interestingly dual targeting to mitochondria and _LOCATION_ was observed for several proteins proline oxidase _PROTEIN_ ribosomal protein related aaa _PROTEIN_ oxoisovalerate dehydrogenase . for two proteins dual targeting was only apparent in onion cells grpe co chaperone like _PROTEIN_ . surprisingly also the small heat shock proteins and appear to be dual targeted to mitochondria and chloroplasts although they had previously been assumed to be only mitochondrial . for an embryo abundant protein dual targeting to both mitochondria and _LOCATION_ could be observed . to summarize the _PROTEIN_ profiles of the genes for which a mitochondrial localization was experimentally confirmed as outlined above we used hierarchical clustering of the _PROTEIN_ values in the selected microarray datasets and visualized them in a heat map . in all conditions a clear trend of up regulation was evident and only heat osmotic stress and mutants in _PROTEIN_ or cu/zn sod displayed a _PROTEIN_ in transcript abundance for several genes . treatments that are often considered to be physiologically comparable such as salt and osmotic stress do not always result in a similar transcriptomic response as indicated by their relatively large distance in the sample tree . for example it can be observed that upox and are strongly down regulated during osmotic stress while up regulated during salt stress . similar results have been seen in the response of enzymes of the ascorbate glutathione cycle which showed increased activity during high salinity and _PROTEIN_ activity during drought . in other cases comparable treatments did cluster together such as heat treatment of seedlings and cell cultures . furthermore treatment with h o resulted in similar _PROTEIN_ profiles as the catalase deficient plants that accumulate peroxisomal h o during the high light treatment . interestingly treatment with complex i inhibitor rotenone and the phytohormone salicylic acid resulted in similar _PROTEIN_ patterns . this may be explained by the _PROTEIN_ that also sa has been shown to inhibit complex i activity . in _METHOD_ of gene specific _PROTEIN_ patterns the clustering analysis reveals further correlations that may have functional implications . the two homologous small heat shock proteins and are highly co _PROTEIN_ indicating they may form a functional pair and both are needed for stabilizing mitochondrial proteins and possibly _LOCATION_ proteins during stress conditions . small heat shock proteins have previously been shown to dimerize so and may dimerize to be functional . two additional heat shock proteins _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are very similarly _PROTEIN_ . although their _PROTEIN_ patterns are partially divergent from the small heat shock proteins it appears more closely related to the grpe co chaperone . in yeast a mitochondrial grpe co chaperone has been shown to interact with _PROTEIN_ and is essential for viability so the apparent co _PROTEIN_ of arabidopsis homologs suggests a similar functional relationship . besides heat shock proteins members of the alternative respiratory pathway _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ cluster together . together these proteins can form a complete respiratory chain dissipating energy as heat and not contributing to _PROTEIN_ synthesis and their strong co _PROTEIN_ has been documented previously . furthermore the presence of similar cares in their promoters indicates a high degree of co regulation further confirming that the observed _PROTEIN_ patterns of _METHOD_ genes are at least partially regulated by underlying co regulation _METHOD_ . in addition to _PROTEIN_ that oxidises _LOCATION_ nad h a _PROTEIN_ facing nd _PROTEIN_ that is dual targeted to mitochondria and _LOCATION_ is co _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ . this suggests that stress conditions impose an additional need for nadh reduction from both _LOCATION_ and mitochondria . using the tair gene ontology annotations we looked for go _METHOD_ that were significantly over represented in our final selection as compared to the whole arabidopsis genome . as expected go _METHOD_ for sub cellular location mitochondria and response to stress were strongly over represented . the go annotation electron transport and energy pathways was also over represented . this can be attributed to the presence of alternative etc components _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ a kda putative complex iii subunit . furthermore the go term transport is significantly over represented with the presence of six members of the mitochondrial substrate carrier protein family . the abundance of a protein in the cell is determined by a multitude of _PROTEIN_ including transcription rate mrna stability translation initiation rate protein stability and protein degradation rate . we compared the transcriptional changes observed in our study with a set of organellar proteomics studies on stress treatments that were recently compiled which listed mitochondrial proteins as changing under at least one stress condition . forty three of these were present in our list of genes . for of these the mrna levels were significantly changed in at least one of the selected microarray datasets but only s transferase _PROTEIN_ and heat shock protein _PROTEIN_ present in our final selection of _PROTEIN_ though our _METHOD_ assays could not confirm mitochondrial targeting for _PROTEIN_ . where both transcript and protein level information was available we observed that the fold change for transcript was generally greater than for protein the average fold change for mrna was in contrast to for protein . positive correlations between mrna and protein levels were observed in seven out of cases such as _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . however in eight out of cases such as _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and heat shock protein _PROTEIN_ the mrna and protein levels display an inverse relationship . moreover it was evident that often large fold change differences can be observed in mrna while changes in protein abundance had not been detected in the specific studies _PROTEIN_ . transcription _PROTEIN_ exert their function by binding to specific dna sequence elements so a starting point for defining co regulation is the analysis of the promoter regions of co _PROTEIN_ genes and the identification of common cis acting regulatory element . the bp upstream regions from the transcriptional start site were searched for common sequence elements namely putative binding sites for known transcription _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . from this analysis it was evident that putative binding sites for several classes of transcription _PROTEIN_ were highly represented in this set . these include the _PROTEIN_ a binding site that was shown to be bound by the _PROTEIN_ domain of _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ transcription _PROTEIN_ in pepper _PROTEIN_ has been shown to play a role in biotic and abiotic stress resistance . interestingly the _PROTEIN_ b binding site that is bound by the domain of _PROTEIN_ was only found in a context with the _PROTEIN_ a element in three promoters . this may indicate that _PROTEIN_ or other _PROTEIN_ domain transcription _PROTEIN_ could be involved in co regulation of these genes . furthermore putative binding sites for _PROTEIN_ and myb related transcription _PROTEIN_ were strongly represented . as these are very large families of transcription _PROTEIN_ with and members respectively and the binding sites are variable pinpointing which members may be involved in regulation of these genes will be _PROTEIN_ . in almost half of the bp upstream regions of the selected genes a putative abscisic acid response element/g box was present which has been shown to be bound by _PROTEIN_ transcription _PROTEIN_ . the core binding sequence for wrky type transcription _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was present in the upstream region of more than of these promoters particularly in the promoters of genes that were most stress responsive _PROTEIN_ . wrky transcription _PROTEIN_ have been found to be involved in stress and defense signaling in numerous reports so they are likely candidates for co regulating the mitochondrial stress response . additionally a putative binding site for the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ transcription regulator was present in over half of the promoters . _PROTEIN_ has generally been associated with meristem and floral development and very little is known on a possible role in stress tolerance .
the initial list of genes that encode putatively mitochondrial proteins was compiled based on experimental determination by _METHOD_ _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ targeting and genes that returned a predicted mitochondrial location in all of the following prediction _METHOD_ targetp predator and wolf psort as listed in the _PROTEIN_ database . raw data files for the following experiments were collected . the datasets for osmotic stress salt stress tiba heat abscisic acid cycloheximide and uv b were collected from tair . the datasets in arabidopsis cell cultures for rotenone heat salicylic acid and hydrogen peroxide were those from . the datasets from ozone and quartz filtered uv were obtained from arrayexpress . cel files were normalized using robust multiarray average gc rma in the avadis software suite . for single comparison data experiments a t test after _PROTEIN_ correction was used for statistical analysis . for time course experiments the coefficient of variance the ratio of the standard deviation on all measurements and the average _PROTEIN_ values over the time course were used as statistical measures . for the datasets for _PROTEIN_ deficient mutants treated with high light and for cu/zn sod mutants gc rma normalized _PROTEIN_ values were provided by the authors from . a probe set was defined as differential in a specific condition if the fold change was larger than two fold and the p value was below or coefficient of variation was higher than . to define over represented functional categories we used the gene ontology annotations from the tair website . to test for over represented categories compared to the genome a chi square statistical test was applied . the presence of putative transcription _PROTEIN_ binding sites was assessed using the _PROTEIN_ atcisdb database . searches were restricted to the bp region upstream of the transcriptional start site while for analysis of _PROTEIN_ motif also the untranslated region was downloaded from tair and searched . only putative cares that were present in more than of the promoters are shown in _PROTEIN_ . coding sequences were amplified from arabidopsis thaliana cdna using standard protocols with the roche expand high fidelity pcr system using gene specific primers flanked by gateway recombination cassettes . for some genes encoding large proteins the first bp were cloned as this region is most likely to contain the itochondrial targeting peptide . pcr products were cloned into according to the manufacturer 's instructions . cloning into the final _METHOD_ vectors was as described in . as mitochondrial marker the alternative oxidase _PROTEIN_ targeting signal of amino acids fused to _METHOD_ was used . as _LOCATION_ marker the full length targeting sequence of small subunit of ribulose bisphosphate _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was used . biolistic co transformation of the _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ fusion vectors was performed on arabidopsis cell culture and onion epidermal cells as previously reported . in brief _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ plasmids were co precipitated onto gold particles and transformed using a _PROTEIN_ biolistic transformation system . ml of arabidopsis cell suspension or freshly peeled onion epidermal cells were placed on filters on osmoticum medium and bombarded . cells were then incubated for h at in the dark before microscopy was performed using an olympus _METHOD_ microscope .
