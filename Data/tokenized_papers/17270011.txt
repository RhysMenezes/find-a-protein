the arabidopsis monovalent cation proton antiporter _PROTEIN_ family includes eight members _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ have been well characterized as tonoplast and _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ na /h antiporters respectively . the proteins _PROTEIN_ have been phylogenetically linked to _PROTEIN_ while _PROTEIN_ appears to be related to _PROTEIN_ . here we report functional characterization of _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ t dna insertion mutants are hypersensitive to lithium ions relative to wild type plants but not to the other metal ions such as sodium potassium and caesium . _PROTEIN_ overexpression in a triple deletion yeast mutant that exhibits defective na /li transport specifically suppresses sensitivity to li but does not affect na sensitivity . likewise _PROTEIN_ overexpression complemented sensitivity to li but not na in _PROTEIN_ mutant seedlings and increased li tolerance of both the _PROTEIN_ mutant and wild type seedlings . results of li and k measurement of loss of function and gain of function mutants indicate that _PROTEIN_ may be responsible for li extrusion and may be able to _PROTEIN_ k acquisition and intracellular ion homeostasis . subcellular localization of the _PROTEIN_ enhanced green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ fusion protein suggested that _PROTEIN_ protein is targeted to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . taken together our findings suggest that _PROTEIN_ encodes a putative _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ li /h antiporter that functions in li detoxification and ion homeostasis in arabidopsis .
the _PROTEIN_ protein belongs to the na /h antiporter family and is phylogenetically related to _PROTEIN_ . the predicted _PROTEIN_ full length protein exhibits approximately identity with the _PROTEIN_ sequence over a stretch of amino acids . hydrophobicity plot analysis showed that the n terminal region of _PROTEIN_ is highly hydrophobic . analysis of its genomic sequence has revealed that the _PROTEIN_ gene consists of exons and introns . two arabidopsis thaliana mutant lines named _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ harbouring t dna insertions within the intron and the exon respectively of the _PROTEIN_ gene were identified in the signal database . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ knockout mutant plants lack _PROTEIN_ transcript _PROTEIN_ as demonstrated by rt pcr analysis using _PROTEIN_ specific primers . homozygous mutants showed a clear li hypersensitivity phenotype that was apparent under low li concentrations during seed germination and during the early growth period of the seedlings . while germination of wild type seeds was not significantly disrupted by exposure to licl at concentrations < mm germination of mutant seeds was significantly inhibited in the presence of mm licl . when exposed to mm licl about of the wild type seeds germinated whereas only of the mutant seeds germinated during the day period following transfer to . yet no significant difference was found in germination and subsequent seedling growth between the _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ and wild type under or mm nacl treatment . root elongation of the _PROTEIN_ mutants was also more sensitive to exogenous licl than that of the wild type plants . _PROTEIN_ mutant hypersensitivity appears to be limited to li as no hypersensitivity to other alkali metals such as na k and cs was observed in our experiments . we further assessed the li and k contents of wild type _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ seedlings under moderate licl treatment . li contents of mutants treated with mm licl were both slightly higher than those of the wild type and their k contents were lower than the wild type .the results suggest that the li sensitivity of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ is correlated with their cellular li and k contents . yeast has been utilized as a model organism to study transport and homeostasis of alkali metal cations . cells of s. cerevisiae with mutations in _PROTEIN_ and as well as in _PROTEIN_ are unable to grow in media containing high concentrations of toxic cations primarily na and li . cells _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ exhibited no significant growth difference with respect to control cells when tested in normal medium . however in medium with mm licl concentration which is normally highly toxic to cells _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ greatly improved yeast growth . no growth improvement was observed in the presence of other cations in concentrations toxic to cells . the _PROTEIN_ mutation in s. cerevisiae also causes strong specific hygromycin sensitivity in cells which have been widely used in functional complementation studies to identify _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ na /h antiporters . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ did not suppress hygromycin sensitivity caused by the _PROTEIN_ mutation suggesting that _PROTEIN_ is involved in extruding li from the _LOCATION_ at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ but not in sequestering li into _LOCATION_ . our findings also suggest that _PROTEIN_ is important for li tolerance but not for tolerance to na or other toxic ions . in summary _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ selectively suppresses the li sensitive phenotype of the yeast mutant suggesting that it directs li extrusion out of the cell and functions as an li /h transporter . as _PROTEIN_ is a putative na /h antiporter we hypothesized that it might be inducible by cation stress . _PROTEIN_ specific primers were chosen to perform the rt pcr experiment . rt pcr results indicated that _PROTEIN_ transcript abundance was not significantly changed by the stress treatments of nacl kcl or licl . thus the _PROTEIN_ gene appears not to be transcriptionally activated under the cation stress conditions tested . this result is consistent with microarray data . rt pcr analyses also revealed that _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ in all organs examined including roots shoots leaves and flowers . the transcript level appeared to be a little higher in leaves than in other organs . promoter _PROTEIN_ analysis was performed to examine the tissue specificity of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . gus staining was detected in the leaves hypocotyls primary roots and root hairs of the transgenic seedlings . gus staining was most pronounced in the vascular tissue cells of the leaves robust gus staining was also observed in the root hairs . confocal imaging analysis of overexpressed _PROTEIN_ enhanced green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ fusion protein in transgenic arabidopsis young roots indicated that the protein is targeted to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . as there are no large _LOCATION_ in young roots it is reasonable to believe the fusion protein was targeted to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ rather than the tonoplast . the result is in agreement with _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ localization data from proteomic analyses . a vector only control not including _PROTEIN_ was also used as shown in figure in which the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ spread throughout the cell . to assess further the ion specificity of _PROTEIN_ we generated _PROTEIN_ overexpression lines in the _PROTEIN_ mutant background . the _PROTEIN_ background was chosen because the root growth of _PROTEIN_ plants is obviously hypersensitive to both nacl and licl . furthermore the high degree of sequence similarity between the two genes suggests that the function of _PROTEIN_ may be similar to that of _PROTEIN_ . we observed no discernible phenotypic difference under nacl stress between _PROTEIN_ mutant plants and the _PROTEIN_ plants overexpressing _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . however when the transgenic plants were subjected to the stress of li the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ transgenic seedlings displayed greatly enhanced li tolerance . these results indicate that overexpression of _PROTEIN_ selectively complemented the li sensitive phenotype of the _PROTEIN_ mutant and greatly improved the li tolerance of _PROTEIN_ mutant seedlings . similar results were obtained during germination . the germination rates of lines overexpressing _PROTEIN_ approached nearly in the presence of mm licl a concentration that strongly inhibited germination in wild type plants . the seedlings root growth was also measured under li or na treatments . the root growth of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ exhibited no obvious difference with increased licl treatment but they showed similar growth with _PROTEIN_ when subjected to nacl stress . although it seemed that the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ seedlings were slightly more tolerant to mm nacl they were eventually killed by mm nacl as _PROTEIN_ . transgenic seedlings with a wild type background _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ displayed no obvious differences from wild type seedlings under kcl cscl or stress as well as or mm nacl treatment . however the _PROTEIN_ seedlings displayed dramatically improved li tolerance . the three lines of _PROTEIN_ transgenic seedlings could survive with licl stress as high as mm licl while wild type seedlings could not grow when li concentration was > mm . in addition we found that on licl treatment seedlings overexpressing _PROTEIN_ accumulated less li than wild type plants suggesting that _PROTEIN_ is important for li efflux in plant cells . examination of k content revealed that the transgenic lines _PROTEIN_ substantially higher k content when subjected to mm licl treatment . this suggests that _PROTEIN_ is involved in the regulation of k and other ion homeostasis under li stress conditions . we also examined the effect of li on the germination of transgenic seeds and subsequent seedling growth . both the germination of wild type seeds and subsequent seedling growth were nearly completely inhibited by mm licl whereas transgenic plants were not much affected . more significantly these transgenic plants could grow even in the presence of mm licl .
