the sucrose non fermenting related protein kinase family represents a unique family of plant specific protein kinases implicated in cellular signalling in response to osmotic stress . in our studies we observed that two class kinases _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are rapidly and transiently activated in arabidopsis roots after exposure to salt . under saline conditions _PROTEIN_ knockout mutants had a reduced primary root length while _PROTEIN_ mutants exhibited a reduction in the number of _PROTEIN_ roots . the reduced _PROTEIN_ root density was found to be a combinatory effect of a _PROTEIN_ in the number of _PROTEIN_ root primordia and an increase in the number of arrested _PROTEIN_ root primordia . the phenotypes were in agreement with the observed _PROTEIN_ patterns of genomic yellow _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ fusions of _PROTEIN_ and under control of their native promoter sequences . _PROTEIN_ was found to be _PROTEIN_ in the vascular tissue at the base of a developing _PROTEIN_ root whereas _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ throughout the root with higher _PROTEIN_ in the vascular system . salt stress triggered a rapid re localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ from the _LOCATION_ to punctate structures in root epidermal cells . differential centrifugation experiments of isolated arabidopsis root proteins confirmed recruitment of endogenous _PROTEIN_ to _LOCATION_ upon exposure to salt supporting their observed binding affinity for the phospholipid phosphatidic acid . together our results reveal a role for _PROTEIN_ and in root growth and architecture in saline conditions .
to investigate their possible role in salt stress signalling activation of _PROTEIN_ and was studied in a. thaliana roots . plants grown hydroponically for days were transferred to control or saline medium and kinase activity was monitored using an in gel kinase assay on root protein extracts . to identify _PROTEIN_ and activation and to determine their roles in salt related signalling two independent t dna insertion lines were isolated for both kinases _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . using an anti antibody these mutants were confirmed to be knock outs at the protein level . activation of _PROTEIN_ and was studied in roots of hydroponically grown plants that had been stressed by transfer to different salt concentrations ranging between and mm nacl or mm mannitol . crude protein extracts were separated by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ with the generic protein kinase substrate myelin basic protein immobilized in the gel . myelin basic protein can be phosphorylated by several protein kinase families including mitogen activated protein kinases and allowing visualization of the activity of the endogenous kinases . two kinases with molecular weights of and kda are activated between min and h and min and h in response to mm nacl . at the expected molecular weight of _PROTEIN_ and a fast and transient activation of a protein kinase was observed between sec and min and the activation increased again after h. to determine whether this protein kinase activity represented _PROTEIN_ or both immunoprecipitation was performed with an antibody that recognizes both _PROTEIN_ and and the protein kinase activity was analysed by an in gel kinase assay . in addition kinase activation was investigated in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutant backgrounds after a min salt stress . as shown in the activation kinetics of the immunoprecipitated resembled the activation pattern observed at kda in the crude extract . activation was very fast peaking at min and was rapidly repressed but reappeared after h. the identity of _PROTEIN_ and as the kda band in the crude extract was confirmed in the _PROTEIN_ mutant background where the kda band was completely absent after min of salt stress . _PROTEIN_ and were activated to a similar degree since the kda kinase activity was similar in both single mutants . western blot analysis with the same antibody on the crude extract showed that there were no changes in protein abundance up to h of salt treatment . no kinase activation was observed when plants were transferred to control medium . a similar activation pattern was observed when mm mannitol was used indicating that _PROTEIN_ and are activated in arabidopsis roots in response to salt and osmotic stress . snrk and are among the fastest activated protein kinases in arabidopsis thaliana roots upon salt stress . in gel kinase assay of protein extracts from hydroponically grown roots exposed to mm nacl . in the upper panel the activity of a number of kinases is detected . at kda the activation of _PROTEIN_ and is observed . in the second panel in gel kinase activity is shown after immunoprecipitation with an antibody against _PROTEIN_ confirming the identity of these bands to be _PROTEIN_ . in the third panel the western blot analysis shows _PROTEIN_ and protein abundances at the different time points and in the lower panel _METHOD_ brilliant blue is shown as a loading control . _PROTEIN_ and are responsible for the kinase activity observed at kds . the same approach as shown in was conducted in the single and double mutant background after min of mm salt stress . all the protein kinase assays were performed with myelin basic protein immobilized in the gel as substrate . in arabidopsis salinity been shown to cause changes in the root system architecture allowing plants to optimize their growth under this condition . to assess whether the protein kinases play a role in this response primary root length and _PROTEIN_ root density were studied in the _PROTEIN_ and mutants in both control and saline conditions . to avoid any _METHOD_ with sucrose affecting root growth through direct uptake via the leaves media were prepared without sucrose . _PROTEIN_ and are involved in _PROTEIN_ primary and _PROTEIN_ root growth respectively in saline conditions . arabidopsis thaliana seeds of col _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were sown on agar plates containing _METHOD_ . the plants were grown vertically under an angle of . after days the seedlings were transferred either to control or plates supplemented with or mm salt . plates were scanned and the primary root length and the _PROTEIN_ root density were measured days after the transfer using image analysis software and counting of visual _PROTEIN_ roots . the primary root length and the lrd _PROTEIN_ were averaged . the number of replicates varied between and replicates per line and concentration and seedlings were randomized over different plates . the phenotypes were confirmed in three independent studies . the _LOCATION_ bars represent the standard _LOCATION_ and significant differences were determined using tukey b and are indicated by letters . under control conditions there were no differences in primary root length when col wild type and all mutants were compared . the addition of mm nacl to the growth medium did not change this but when exposed to mm nacl significant differences between the wild type and the _PROTEIN_ mutant lines _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ appeared . a reduction of in the primary root length was detected in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and the _PROTEIN_ double mutant whereas the wild type and the _PROTEIN_ lines showed a reduction of only when exposed to salt . when studying the lrs no differences in lrd were observed between wild type and the mutants in control conditions . col showed a reduction in lrd of at mm nacl in comparison to control conditions . in the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ single mutants a significantly greater reduction was observed showing a reduction of close to at mm nacl in comparison to control conditions . the double mutant again phenocopied the single mutants also showing a reduction in lrd . similar results were obtained when exposing col and the mutant lines to mm nacl . these data show that both protein kinases are involved in _PROTEIN_ root system architecture under saline conditions where _PROTEIN_ exerts its function predominantly in the primary root and _PROTEIN_ in the lrs . the reduction in lrd in the single _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ double mutant could either be due to a reduction in the number of _PROTEIN_ root primordia or to a defect in their development . to investigate this in more detail the developmental stages of all the primordia were studied . as shown in no difference in the primary root length was observed for the _PROTEIN_ mutant compared with the col wild type under any of the conditions tested . for col the lrd and the non emerged lrp density were measured at control conditions and media supplemented with and mm nacl . in control conditions of the total _PROTEIN_ root primordia developed into a lr . when transferred to mm nacl there was a _PROTEIN_ in the total number of primordia but only of the lrp developed into a lr . at the higher salt concentration the total number of primordia _PROTEIN_ by compared with control conditions but the percentage of lrp that developed into a lr was similar to that observed at mm nacl . the _PROTEIN_ knockout line exhibits a reduction in the number of _PROTEIN_ root primordia in saline conditions . col and _PROTEIN_ were grown and treated similarly as in . primary root length of col and _PROTEIN_ seedlings . salt induces an increase in arrested lrp and a reduction in the total number of lrp . the _PROTEIN_ root density of col was measured as in . the total number of lrp was counted using a binocular after fixing and clearing the roots . the non emerged lrp _PROTEIN_ roots and the total number of lrp were plotted per cm primary root . asterisks in the dark and light bars represent significant differences in the density of non emerged lrp and lrs respectively . asterisks above the bars indicate significant differences in the density of the total number of lrp . the _PROTEIN_ knock out line shows a reduction in lrs and total lrp but not in the non emerged lrp . the number of replicates varied between and replicates per line and concentration and seedlings were randomized over different plates . the phenotypes were confirmed in three independent studies . the _LOCATION_ bars represent the standard _LOCATION_ and significant differences have been determined using a student s t test . in control conditions no significant difference in either the lrd or lrp density was detected between col and _PROTEIN_ . at both and mm nacl the density of total _PROTEIN_ root primordia was less in _PROTEIN_ than in the wild type . in addition to this reduction a more pronounced effect was found in the percentage of lrp that developed into a lr _PROTEIN_ which effectively accounted for the overall reduction of over in the emerged lrd . these results show that the reduction in lrd is partly due to a reduction in the total lrp density but predominantly caused by a reduction in the percentage of lrp that developed into a lr showing that _PROTEIN_ plays a role in the development of lrp in saline conditions . their high homology at the amino acid sequence level indicated similar functions for the _PROTEIN_ and protein kinases . however the knock out mutants clearly showed different phenotypes in root system architecture in response to salt . to study their _PROTEIN_ in roots _METHOD_ fusions of _PROTEIN_ and under the control of their native promoter sequence were constructed and transformed into their respective mutant backgrounds . in the primary root _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was not detectable in the root tip and was predominantly _PROTEIN_ in the vascular tissue in distal root tissue . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was not detectable in the lrp during the initial stages of development in stages and but was highly _PROTEIN_ in the adjacent vascular tissue . further from the root tip _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was higher in cortex cells . in addition _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ specifically accumulated in the developing vascular tissue of a newly emerged lr . _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ in the vascular tissue at the site of a _PROTEIN_ root . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was stably transformed into the _PROTEIN_ mutant background . the mid section of the primary root _PROTEIN_ root primordia in stage and emerged were imaged . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ is primarily _PROTEIN_ in the vascular tissue distal from the root tip . the arrow indicates the accumulation of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in the developing vascular tissue of an emerged _PROTEIN_ root . prior to imaging plants were exposed to propidium iodide for min . plants were grown vertically under an angle of on agar plates containing _METHOD_ and sugar for days . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ is shown in green and propidium iodide is shown in red . wide field images are depicted with their corresponding confocal images and all the pictures were taken with the same confocal settings . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was _PROTEIN_ in almost all cells proximal to the root tip of the primary root excluding the columella cells . the highest accumulation of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was in pericycle cells . further distal from the root tip _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ also accumulated in the endodermis while its abundance in the adjacent cortex cells was reduced . even further distal from the root tip the _PROTEIN_ in the epidermal cells was low . interestingly at the site of a developing lrp _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ accumulated in punctate structures in the lrp . at a _PROTEIN_ stage of lrp development _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was present in the _LOCATION_ of all the lrp cells . remarkably enhanced _PROTEIN_ was observed in the cortex cells at the side of the developing lrp which was not observed in the cortex cells on the other side . in addition accumulation of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was observed in punctate structures in these cells . in the emerged lr _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was _PROTEIN_ at low levels in the developing vascular tissue similar to the _PROTEIN_ pattern of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ in cells surrounding an emerging _PROTEIN_ root primordium and accumulates in punctate structures in these cells . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was stably transformed into the _PROTEIN_ mutant . the mid section of the primary root lrp in stage stage and emerged were imaged . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ accumulated in pericycle and the endodermis . at the site of a stage lrp _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was highly _PROTEIN_ and accumulated in punctate structures . the _PROTEIN_ in epidermal cells was lower compared than in the root tip . cortex cells surrounding the lrp contained higher levels _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and similar punctate structures as observed in a stage lrp . accumulation in the developing vascular tissue of an emerged _PROTEIN_ root . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ is shown in green and propidium iodide is shown in red . the growth conditions were the same and all the pictures were taken with the same confocal settings as used in . to investigate whether localization of _PROTEIN_ or would change in response to salt treatment seedlings were treated with mm nacl . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ relocalized from the _LOCATION_ to punctate structures within min of salt application in epidermal cells . two minutes after the start of the treatment _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was still predominantly _LOCATION_ but after min most of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ had moved from the _LOCATION_ and accumulated at unknown punctate structures . to confirm that the fusion protein was functional western analysis and an in gel kinase assay were performed on the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ line which showed that the fusion protein was intact and could be activated by salt treatment similar to the endogenous _PROTEIN_ protein kinase _PROTEIN_ . moreover an n terminal _METHOD_ fusion of the _PROTEIN_ protein could also be activated by salt _PROTEIN_ and this fusion also relocalized to punctate structures upon salt treatment _PROTEIN_ similar to _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ ruling out any positional effect of the _METHOD_ protein tag on localization of the protein . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ localization did not seem to be affected by salt treatment . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ accumulates in punctate structures in root epidermal cells upon salt stress . seven day old _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ seedlings were stained with propidium iodide for min and subsequently placed either in control medium or medium containing mm nacl . the first image was taken min after the saline medium was applied . images were taken in epidermal cells approximately above the root tip . in the lower right corner the same area is shown after min of control treatment . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ is shown in green and propidium iodide is shown in red . the growth conditions were the same and all the pictures were taken with the same confocal settings as used in . a co localization study with a lipophilic dye to label _LOCATION_ was performed to further investigate the nature of the accumulation of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . after treatment with the dye for h prior to the min salt stress treatment co localization occurred in some of the punctate structures that were closer to the _LOCATION_ indicating that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ is targeted to cellular _LOCATION_ . in order to further confirm the salt induced recruitment to _LOCATION_ endogenous _PROTEIN_ levels were analysed after subcellular fractionation in control and salt stressed roots . this approach consisted of a number of different centrifugation steps allowing the isolation of proteins that are associated with the _LOCATION_ . a similar approach conducted on sorghum bicolour was described earlier . different fractions were analysed by using antibodies against proteins that reside in different cellular compartments . protein concentrations of all fractions were normalized in order to determine relative alterations between fractions . the total g supernatant and the brij wash fraction _PROTEIN_ consisted of _LOCATION_ proteins in both control and salt stimulated samples . _PROTEIN_ were highly abundant in these fractions confirming their _LOCATION_ localization . both the g and g _LOCATION_ pellet fractions contained _LOCATION_ contamination but contained _PROTEIN_ trans _LOCATION_ and peripheral _LOCATION_ proteins . in comparison to the _LOCATION_ marker _PROTEIN_ was enriched in these fractions indicating they were partially _LOCATION_ bound in both control and saline conditions . when the _LOCATION_ contaminants were removed by brij washing a striking increase of _PROTEIN_ was observed in the remaining pellet fraction of the salt treated samples but not in the control samples . the peripheral _LOCATION_ marker v _PROTEIN_ subunit was equally present in this fraction in both samples indicating that the same protein pools were isolated . the localization of _PROTEIN_ in these fractionation studies indicated not only _LOCATION_ but also _LOCATION_ associated localization in saline conditions confirming the confocal microscopy observations and showing that _PROTEIN_ is recruited to the _LOCATION_ upon salt stress . _PROTEIN_ are targeted to cellular _LOCATION_ during salt stress and bind phosphatidic acid _PROTEIN_ in vitro . proteins from control or mm nacl treated arabidopsis roots were isolated and fractionated using sequential centrifugation steps . pellet fractions are indicated with p and the supernatant fractions are indicated with s. western blot analysis was performed on these fractions using antibodies against different compartment markers or _PROTEIN_ . _LOCATION_ were isolated and washed with brij to remove any _LOCATION_ contaminants . from the upper to lower panel _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ peripheral _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and the _LOCATION_ marker fructose biphosphate . in the lowest panel a silver stain is shown as a loading control . both _PROTEIN_ and bind liposomes containing _PROTEIN_ purified glutathione s transferase _PROTEIN_ tagged recombinant protein was mixed with liposomes containing phosphatidylcholine pc/phosphatidylserine or pc/pa . lipid concentrations available for binding were mm for ps and or mm for _PROTEIN_ . the start fraction represents the input the pellet fraction represents the fraction that bound to the liposomes and the supernatant represents the remainder . relative loading start pellet supernatant . salinity stress is known to induce changes in the phospholipid composition of _LOCATION_ in arabidopsis including the transient formation of _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ was identified in a proteomic screen for _PROTEIN_ targets and was shown to bind _PROTEIN_ affinity beads . to test whether _PROTEIN_ and its most related family member _PROTEIN_ directly bind to _PROTEIN_ and to assess the specificity of lipid binding recombinant _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ proteins purified from escherichia coli were tested in a liposome binding assay . since liposomes consist of a lipid bilayer interaction with a more naturally organized _PROTEIN_ can be shown using this approach . both _PROTEIN_ and exhibited binding affinity for _PROTEIN_ containing liposomes in a concentration dependent manner while no binding could be detected for liposomes containing another anionic phospholipid phosphatidylserine or control lipids consisting only of the structural phospholipid phosphatidylcholine . thus _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are able to bind _PROTEIN_ directly and selectively in vitro providing a possible molecular basis for the observed interaction of _PROTEIN_ with cellular _LOCATION_ upon exposure of roots to salt .

recombination sites and were recombined into . the resulting entry vectors were used in lr clonase recombination reactions with to generate _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ fusion
