mitochondria are defining components of most eukaryotes . however higher plant mitochondria differ biochemically morphologically and dynamically from those in other eukaryotes . _PROTEIN_ a member of the clustered mitochondria superfamily is conserved among eukaryotes and is required for correct distribution of mitochondria within the cell . we sought to understand how disruption of _PROTEIN_ function in arabidopsis leads to mitochondrial clustering and the effects of this aberrant chondriome on cell and whole plant physiology . we present evidence for a role of _PROTEIN_ in mediating intermitochondrial association which is a necessary prelude to mitochondrial fusion . we demonstrate that disruption of mitochondrial association motility and chondriome structure in friendly affects mitochondrial quality control and leads to mitochondrial stress cell death and strong growth phenotypes .
the friendly mutant was originally identified due to the clustered mitochondrial phenotype however no analysis was made _PROTEIN_ the size distribution of clusters relative to the wild type . here mitochondria in wild type plants were found to be distributed evenly throughout the cytoplasm in both leaves and roots while in friendly many mitochondria were arranged in large clusters of tens of organelles in addition to singletons that had a distribution resembling the wild type . in order to quantify cluster number and size clusters were defined as discrete associations in an area of at least a phenotype that was not observed in healthy wild type plants . while no clusters were observed in the wild type some mitochondria were observed to be in loose groups with an average area of in leaf epidermal pavement cells and in root epidermal cells . the average mitochondrial cluster size in friendly leaf epidermal pavement cells was while significantly larger clusters covering an average of were observed in roots . there was no significant difference in the number of clusters in leaves or roots in friendly . the majority of groups in the wild type covered an area less than in both leaves and roots while the larger size classes were more frequently observed in root cells reflecting the greater mean group size in this cell type . in friendly the majority of clusters fell within the to range while as in the wild type clusters covering larger areas were more frequently present in roots than in leaves . a similar phenotype was observed in the friendly transfer dna mutant . mitochondrial clusters in leaves prepared for transmission electron microscopy by chemical fixation showed no obvious outer _LOCATION_ connectivity . however given the importance of any intermitochondrial connection in the mutant to the role of _PROTEIN_ we decided to investigate this further by two complementary methods . in order to determine whether or not mitochondria in clusters in friendly were connected to each other by a contiguous outer _LOCATION_ leaf material prepared by high pressure freezing was viewed by tem . membranous structures were well preserved within the cytoplasm of both wild type and mutant leaves allowing clear identification of fine membranous organelles such as the _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ within chloroplasts . no organelles other than mitochondria appeared to be affected morphologically by the friendly mutation . over ultrathin sections were observed from at least three plants and there was no evidence of continuity of the outer _LOCATION_ between mitochondria in a cluster . however electron dense regions were observed between individual mitochondria within a cluster . an independent approach was used to investigate the connectivity of the mitochondrial _PROTEIN_ of adjacent mitochondria in a cluster using _METHOD_ recovery after photobleaching of the mitochondrial targeted _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . a strip through a cluster was photobleached using the nm laser and no recovery was observed up to s after bleaching . due to the physically dispersed nature of the wild type arabidopsis chondriome a meaningful photobleaching control could not be performed on the wild type . instead in order to observe how quickly _METHOD_ could diffuse within a _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ we performed frap on mitochondrial tubules of the network mutant first identified by citation . mito _METHOD_ was able to diffuse into bleached areas of the _PROTEIN_ within s . we next focused on the dynamism of clusters in friendly and their interaction with the _LOCATION_ . single mitochondria in friendly move on actin filaments as in the wild type . similarly small clusters of mitochondria in friendly are also able to move on actin filaments and depolymerization of f actin with latrunculin b arrests this movement . larger clusters assemble due to the aggregation of smaller clusters that are brought together through movement on actin and these large clusters are less able to move through the _LOCATION_ intact and are disrupted by the forces of cytoplasmic streaming such as restructuring of the actin _LOCATION_ and physical bottlenecks in the cytoplasm . clusters of mitochondria in friendly therefore are highly dynamic transient structures composed of discrete organelles that are able to interact with the actin _LOCATION_ in a wild type manner . furthermore while we had previously hypothesized that clusters in friendly may be tethered to microtubules we found no evidence of any association with either microtubules _METHOD_ or more specifically the plus ends of microtubules and partial depolymerization of microtubules did not affect the movement of clusters . in contrast depolymerization of the actin _LOCATION_ in the wild type using latrunculin b was able to phenocopy the friendly phenotype . this apparent stickiness of mitochondria in the absence of their actin scaffold is not observed with other organelles that move on actin . for example while _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ bodies move on actin and latrunculin b arrests this movement neither organelle _METHOD_ large clusters in response to actin depolymerization . furthermore the clustering of mitochondria in friendly is not due to a general cytoskeletal or motor defect since the distribution and movement of _LOCATION_ are not affected in the mutant and no altered distribution of other organelles was observed in tem images . these observations support the hypothesis that mitochondria are attracted to one another and that movement on actin filaments counters this attraction by providing the scaffold and driving force to keep mitochondria separate except during their regulated association and transient fusion . a c terminal translational fusion of _METHOD_ to the full length _PROTEIN_ complementary dna coding sequence was generated to visualize the _PROTEIN_ location . _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in wild type arabidopsis showed a _LOCATION_ location often with a punctate distribution . similar localization patterns were observed using transient _PROTEIN_ in tobacco . to demonstrate that this _PROTEIN_ pattern was unlikely to be due to overexpression we performed transient _PROTEIN_ in friendly seedlings both c and n terminal fusions to monomeric red _METHOD_ _METHOD_ showed a punctate distribution in close association with mitochondria . cotransformation of tobacco with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and mito mcherry demonstrated that the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ puncta were frequently associated with mitochondria . that this was a dynamic association is evident from the time lapse movie . as with stable transformation in arabidopsis a punctate pattern was not always observed instead a more diffuse cytoplasmic distribution was apparent . in the cortical cytoplasm this appeared as a _LOCATION_ as the fusion protein was excluded from areas occupied by other organelles . in order to exclude the possibility that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was localized to organelles exhibiting a similar punctate pattern coexpression in tobacco was performed with _METHOD_ markers of _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ and the _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ no colocalization was apparent . similarly the cortical reticular pattern of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was distinct from that of the _LOCATION_ visualized by coexpression of the _LOCATION_ marker _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ . our data demonstrating a _LOCATION_ localization is in agreement with a recent _LOCATION_ proteomic study . the yeast _PROTEIN_ ortholog also has been localized by proteomics to the _LOCATION_ and the drosophila melanogaster ortholog clu has been shown to be a _LOCATION_ protein that associates peripherally with mitochondria in d. melanogaster follicle nurse cells . our observations of the movement of mitochondrial clusters on actin the role of actin in bringing mitochondria together in the formation of clusters and the dynamism of clusters led us to consider how clusters form . mitochondria in wild type arabidopsis that meet one another through the movement on actin often display a short period of association during which time fusion and subsequent fission can occur a phenomenon also seen in some mammalian cells and termed kiss and run . figure displays individual frames from supplemental movie that show two association/disassociation events in the wild type the images reference one of these associations that occurs within s and the subsequent disassociation that occurs within a further s . in contrast the images in figure reference an association/disassociation event between an initially discrete single _LOCATION_ and another _LOCATION_ at the exterior of a cluster in friendly the single _LOCATION_ associates with the cluster within s and disassociates s _PROTEIN_ . by analyzing movies each of the wild type and friendly we were able to quantify the average length of intermitochondrial association in the wild type the average is s however in the friendly mutant the average time of association is significantly greater at s . this extended association time between mitochondria in friendly is sufficient to lead to the buildup of a cluster as more mitochondria become temporarily associated before eventually being able to leave the cluster if sufficiently close to a filament of actin . to demonstrate that longer association times lead to more mitochondrial clustering we constructed and simulated a simple stochastic model of mitochondrial dynamics . in this model mitochondria represented as individual agents undergo random motion on a three dimensional lattice with the rate of mitochondrial motion depending on whether a _LOCATION_ is clustered or free . as mean association time increases the proportion of mitochondria existing in clusters in the steady state increases in concert . this provides independent theoretical evidence that alteration of mitochondrial association alone could be responsible for the clustering of mitochondria in friendly . in supplemental document we also provide a simple analytic argument that qualitatively recapitulates this behavior . it was suggested recently that mitochondrial fusion involves the formation of a pore in the inner mitochondrial _LOCATION_ thereby causing transient changes in the _LOCATION_ potential of the fusion partners . we decided therefore to investigate _LOCATION_ potential dynamics in friendly . transient changes in _LOCATION_ potential which we term pulses are rare events in the wild type thus it was immediately evident from confocal scanning laser microscopy imaging that the number of mitochondria exhibiting pulses and the frequency of pulses were greater in friendly than in the wild type . mitochondria undergoing a pulse in the reference images of hypocotyl cells _PROTEIN_ mito _METHOD_ are identified by their green color due to mito _METHOD_ _METHOD_ in the absence of the _PROTEIN_ localized red tetramethylrhodamine methyl ester while mitochondria with a greater _LOCATION_ potential are yellow orange due to the colocalization of tmrm and mito _METHOD_ in their _PROTEIN_ . in friendly the extent of pulsing was highly variable between cells and there was considerable heterogeneity of _LOCATION_ potential within the chondriome although in general mitochondria in clusters showed the same baseline _LOCATION_ potential as those not in clusters . quantification of the number of pulses showed that the average frequency of pulses was per mitochondria per minute in the wild type while in friendly it was increased to per mitochondria per minute an increase of approximately . there was no significant difference in the frequency of pulses for mitochondria in a cluster compared with those not in clusters . our interpretation of these results is that fusion initiation events via the formation of a fusion pore occur with higher frequency in friendly relative to the wild type . to test whether the increased rate of pulsing correlated with an increase in the extent of _PROTEIN_ mixing and therefore intermitochondrial fusion we devised a quantitative in vivo fusion assay using the mitochondria targeted photoconvertible protein mito monomeric eos . _PROTEIN_ localized meos was photoconverted within highly motile mitochondria in a region of leaf epidermis . the percentage reduction in numbers of green mitochondria as a result of the exchange of _PROTEIN_ contents during repeated transient fusion events with mitochondria containing photoconverted meos was significantly greater at the end of the assay time period in friendly relative to that in the wild type . the _PROTEIN_ that an exchange of _PROTEIN_ contents was not seen in the frap experiments can likely be accounted for simply because we analyzed by necessity a single relatively immobile cluster by photobleaching and therefore interaction with other mitochondria outside of the cluster could not occur . similarly the fusion assay by necessity required mitochondria to be motile since there would be no fusion between dispersed mitochondria unless they were able to meet . in addition observation of hundreds of individual association events between a single red _LOCATION_ and a single green _LOCATION_ failed to demonstrate extensive mixing of the two meos species suggesting that there is limited _PROTEIN_ exchange per fusion event as reported for mammalian cells . the result of this fusion assay demonstrates that the increased association time is not simply due to mitochondria trying but failing to fuse with one another but that it increases the chance that transient fusion events can occur facilitating the exchange of _PROTEIN_ content . while friendly was identified solely on the basis of its mitochondrial phenotype there is a series of whole plant defective phenotypes as a consequence . plants of the same age are smaller and have shorter more rounded leaves . _METHOD_ is reduced in friendly significantly so at to d old however the most obvious phenotypic difference between the mutant and the wild type is the length of the primary root . primary root length is significantly shorter in friendly seedlings at and d such that by d the root of the mutant is almost half the length of the wild type . similarly when seedlings are grown in darkness the hypocotyl length is significantly shorter in friendly than in the wild type . the reduction in total root length is reflected in a significant reduction in the length of the cap/meristematic region and a slightly greater reduction in the elongation zone . root width was also reduced significantly in friendly compared with its wild type . similar whole plant phenotypes were apparent in the friendly t dna mutant . propidium iodide _PROTEIN_ staining of roots was performed to visualize root cell architecture in order to determine whether it was a reduction in cell number and/or cell size that was responsible for the reduction in root length . as can be seen from the data in figure the roots of friendly are composed of smaller cells therefore there are a greater number of cells in a defined length of root tissue . however _PROTEIN_ staining also revealed that roots of friendly contained many dead cells which are permeable to _PROTEIN_ while few dead cells were observed in wild type roots . for independent confirmation using a more specific and robust probe sytox orange was used as a probe that readily and selectively enters cells with a damaged _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and stains dna . a greater number of dead cells were observed in friendly than in the wild type in all developmental zones with significant increases measured in the elongation and differentiation zones . the significant increase in root cell death led us to investigate a potential breakdown in the mitochondrial quality control process in friendly . lysotracker has been used to assess autophagy in plants and while not specific for autophagosomes it does label acid _LOCATION_ required for the process . we stained d old wild type and friendly seedlings using lysotracker red dnd for min followed by capture of z stacks by cslm of the root elongation zone . we observed increases in both the size and number of lysotracker stained compartments in friendly compared with the wild type . quantification of lysotracker stained compartments demonstrated that there were significant increases in the number and area of lysotracker stained compartments in roots of friendly compared with the wild type . the increased size and number of acid compartments in friendly are consistent with a role for _PROTEIN_ in the _PROTEIN_ of cell health . to discover what other processes and functions are altered in friendly that may contribute to the loss of cell health and the whole plant phenotypes we decided to analyze the friendly transcriptome . to understand the molecular implications and overall impact of the friendly mutation and of compromised fusion control on whole cell homeostasis we performed a set of microarray based transcriptome studies on whole seedlings . although in general only small fold changes of abundance in friendly relative to the wild type were observed these changes were determined to be significant using cybr t for nonredundant transcripts . the significantly regulated transcripts were allocated to functional groups using mapman resulting in the identification of significantly regulated functional groups of genes . the functional groups included protein synthesis and protein degradation consistent with the observed induction of autophagy . together with photosynthesis and photosynthetic light reactions which were also significantly regulated this functional group set was identified previously by meta analysis of multiple transcriptomic data sets as being a general indicator for mitochondrial dysfunction . in addition to these classes we also observed regulation of abiotic stress redox and tricarboxylic acid cycle that can be clearly linked to mitochondrial dysfunction . interestingly significant regulation was also determined for transcription including by the nac _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ domain superfamily of transcription _PROTEIN_ members of which have been implicated in mitochondrial retrograde signaling . mean _PROTEIN_ fold ratios of transcripts were analyzed by functional class scoring for each experiment using mapman software and applying the hochberg correction . numbers of transcript elements within each bin are indicated along with the p value . to determine the impact of the friendly mutation on mitochondrial respiration and specifically on the alternative pathway we measured oxygen uptake by whole seedlings in the aqueous phase using a clark type oxygen electrode . there was no significant difference in average oxygen uptake between the wild type and friendly under noninhibited baseline conditions . however in the presence of mm kcn an inhibitor of the cytochrome pathway average oxygen uptake by wild type seedlings was reduced to oxygen chlorophyll a percentage inhibition of while average oxygen uptake by friendly seedlings was only reduced to oxygen chlorophyll which was not a statistically significant change relative to uptake in the absence of kcn and equated to an inhibition of only . this suggested that much of the oxygen uptake of friendly seedlings was due to the alternative pathway . to test this we next measured the effect of mm propylgallate an inhibitor of the alternative oxidase on the kcn insensitive oxygen uptake . propylgallate in combination with kcn reduced oxygen uptake by wild type and friendly seedlings to approximately the same rate equating to a combined inhibition of kcn and propylgallate of baseline uninhibited oxygen uptake of approximately confirming that alternative oxidase induction is responsible for the kcn insensitive oxygen consumption in friendly . to test the result from the transcriptome analysis suggesting photosynthetic defects in friendly we next investigated psi and psii activities . there was no difference in steady state psii redox state between the wild type and friendly as estimated by the chlorophyll _METHOD_ parameter ql . this observation was true both at the growth irradiance of photons and when the leaf being sampled was exposed to an actinic light of photons . similarly there was no difference in the capacity for nonphotochemical dissipation of excess light between the friendly mutant and the wild type . psi activity measured as the change in was used to probe possible effects of the friendly mutation on psi function and its supply of electrons . the wild type plants exhibited a greater level of psi activity and an increased value . psi was also more slowly reduced in friendly this measure of how rapidly psi is rereduced following the removal of far red illumination indicates that psi is receiving a diminished supply of electrons from plastocyanin and the photosynthetic electron transport chain . to probe whether the number of electrons available to psi from the electron transport chain was diminished in friendly we used the areas under the curve of the single and multiple turnover flashes . the results confirm the psi rereduction observations with friendly having a lower number of electrons available from sources outside of the linear electron transport chain . values shown are means se . for experimental details see materials and methods. a lys acetylated peptide of the _PROTEIN_ protein containing the two acetylation sites lys and lys was identified in the analysis performed by citation supplemental fig . . to validate the biological meaning of both sites and rule out artifacts we studied the effect of lys acetylation of lys and lys on the function of _PROTEIN_ by site directed mutagenesis . the respective lys residues were mutated to either arg or gln and the mutagenized cdna coding sequences as well as the wild type coding sequences were used to stably transform either friendly or its wild type followed by an analysis of mitochondrial clustering relative to overexpression or complementation . the _PROTEIN_ that the mitochondrial phenotype of wild type plants is altered by overexpression of _PROTEIN_ suggests that _PROTEIN_ function is dependent on its _PROTEIN_ level . both and mutants were able to complement friendly to levels similar to the _PROTEIN_ of the wild type coding sequence . in contrast mutation of either lys to gln _PROTEIN_ complementation relative to the lys to arg mutants or the wild type coding sequence . the reverse results were obtained when wild type plants were transformed with the site directed mutants indicating that only the lys to gln mutations can counter the clustered phenotype caused by overexpression in wild type plants or transformation of the wild type with either lys to arg mutants or the wild type construct . the low level of complementation by the lys to gln mutants and the relative lack of effect of transformation with either of the lys to gln mutants in the wild type support the hypothesis that _PROTEIN_ activity can be regulated by lys acetylation .

performed using a nikon confocal laser scanning microscope equipped with a water immersion objective and using and nm excitation for _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ respectively . sections of the true leaves of d old arabidopsis seedlings were high pressure frozen at the biotechnology and biological sciences research council oxford brookes high pressure freezing facility using a baltec apparatus and freeze substituted in the presence of osmium using an afs apparatus as described by citation . after freeze substitution sections were embedded sectioned and observed by tem according to citation . epidermal

were quantified using the analyze particles command in fiji software . clusters of mitochondria in friendly were minimally defined as discrete particles consisting of mitochondria covering an area of at least . groups of wild type mitochondrial were defined as discrete particles covering an area of at least . for frap we used a zeiss lsm inverted confocal laser scanning microscope equipped with and water immersion objectives and driven by a personal computer running _PROTEIN_ lsm software . _METHOD_ was excited with the nm argon laser and emission was collected between and nm . leaf epidermal pavement cells of d old seedlings were used . a portion of a randomly chosen mitochondrial cluster of friendly or of a tubule in the network mutant was bleached using argon laser power followed immediately by a reduction of the argon laser power to and capture of images s apart to observe any _METHOD_ recovery . in order to visualize actin filaments and mitochondria a double transgenic line was generated by crossing mito _METHOD_ with a second line _PROTEIN_ an in frame fusion of mcherry to the c terminal amino acids of mouse talin which _METHOD_ the actin binding domain

vector . a stable arabidopsis line _PROTEIN_ mcherry was crossed with mito _METHOD_ or with the friendly mutant _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and the crossed lines were analyzed using _METHOD_ microscopy . to visualize the plus end of microtubules we pcr amplified using the end binding protein _PROTEIN_ coding sequence from _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and this was cloned and recombined with pdclmcherry x as above . a stable arabidopsis line _PROTEIN_ mcherry _PROTEIN_ was crossed to the wild type and friendly as above . movies were generated from images of the control mito _METHOD_ line or friendly captured at s intervals using microscopy system . five movies were captured of different regions of the epidermis of the true leaves of three d old seedlings to give movies . the results presented are means of associations measured in three independent experimental repeats each composed of movies . association time was calculated as the number of frames counted from the time a single _LOCATION_ was within one mitochondrial width of either a second _LOCATION_ in the case of the wild type mito _METHOD_ line or of a _LOCATION_ at the exterior surface of a cluster of mitochondria in the case of friendly until the same _LOCATION_ moved at least one mitochondrial width from its partner . the dynamic model consists of a set of n model mitochondria positioned on an l l l cubic lattice with periodic boundary conditions . two or more mitochondria can not occupy the same lattice site . a _LOCATION_ is labeled as free if none of its six nearest neighbor sites are occupied by another mitochondria otherwise it is labeled as clustered . the model is initialized by placing the n mitochondria randomly on the lattice . we use the gillespie stochastic simulation algorithm to simulate the subsequent dynamics of the model with each _LOCATION_ able to move to any of its empty nearest neighbor sites . the rate with which a free _LOCATION_ moves to a given neighbor is and the rate with which a clustered _LOCATION_ moves to a given neighbor is . if mitochondria are very sticky then will be much less than . the algorithm is run until the number of clustered mitochondria converges to a steady state nc . we also define the association time as the time interval between an initially free _LOCATION_ first becoming clustered and thereafter becoming free . we record the average association time over all mitochondria and over simulation time . we use l n and for these simulations the results are qualitatively robust across the full range of other reasonable parameterizations . we vary running

average of the first three or the last three time points respectively . to measure the rate of plant root growth seeds were germinated and grown on aseptic agar plates as described above with the

performed using an xe _PROTEIN_ system and the data were collected via the _PROTEIN_ data acquisition system interfaced with the wincontrol software version . to induce minimal _METHOD_ the weak modulated light source was turned on and data were collected for . once the signal had stabilized an _METHOD_ pulse of photons was applied to the leaf to close the psii reaction centers and generate fm . the leaf was then exposed to an actinic light source until a steady state level of _METHOD_ was reached . to estimate the fraction of closed psii reaction centers at steady state a saturating flash was applied and maximum psii _METHOD_ in the light _PROTEIN_ state was determined . following the saturating flash the actinic light was removed and a weak far red light was applied to oxidize the electron transport chain . when a steady state was reached was determined . the actinic light intensity was then increased and the same steps were repeated . the dark _PROTEIN_ optimal quantum yield of photosynthesis was calculated as variable psii _METHOD_ in the dark _PROTEIN_ state /fm according to the equation . the relative redox state of psii at steady state was estimated at each light level using the term ql where ql / . similarly the amount of nonphotochemical quenching was estimated at each light level using the term npq where npq /fm . to estimate the functional activity of psi in friendly fully developed rosette leaves from the same plants used for psii analyses were examined using a _PROTEIN_ control unit equipped with the ed dual wavelength emitter/detector . data were collected using the pda interfaced as described . far red light was applied to the leaf using the fr light source . the deflection in the signal was used to estimate the amount of oxidizable . the functional pool size of intersystem electrons was determined by applying single turnover _PROTEIN_ and multiple turnover flashes . the single turnover flash had a one half peak width of produced by the xe pump flash control unit _PROTEIN_ . the multiple turnover flash had a duration of _METHOD_ . both flashes were produced using the xmt power/control unit . the number of intersystem electrons per was calculated using the equation mtarea/starea . the areas under the curve were calculated using the origin software package . the relative rate of reduction following removal of the far red light was calculated by finding the time required to reach one half of the dark reduction level and thus is presented as a half time value . experimental details for the extraction of proteins from arabidopsis digestion enrichment and _METHOD_ analysis of lys acetylated peptides are given by citation . unless stated otherwise results are _PROTEIN_ as means se of data obtained from independent experiments representing true biological replicates . significant differences between mean values were calculated using student s t test . _METHOD_ micrographs including time lapse movies and z stacks
