the phytohormone abscisic acid plays a vital role in plant development and response to environmental _PROTEIN_ but the complex networks of aba signaling pathways are poorly understood . we previously reported that a chloroplast protein the magnesium protoporphyrin ix chelatase h subunit _PROTEIN_ functions as a receptor for aba in arabidopsis thaliana . here we report that _PROTEIN_ spans the chloroplast envelope and that the _LOCATION_ c terminus of _PROTEIN_ interacts with a group of wrky transcription _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ that function as negative regulators of aba signaling in seed germination and postgermination growth . _PROTEIN_ a central negative regulator inhibits _PROTEIN_ of aba responsive genes such as _PROTEIN_ . in response to a high level of aba signal that recruits _PROTEIN_ from the _LOCATION_ to the _LOCATION_ and promotes _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ interaction _PROTEIN_ relieves the _PROTEIN_ gene of inhibition by repressing _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . these findings describe a unique aba signaling pathway from the early signaling events to downstream gene _PROTEIN_ .
it remains an open question how chloroplast protein _PROTEIN_ transmits a signal across the chloroplast envelope to the _LOCATION_ in response to aba signaling as in chloroplast retrograde signaling . a previous report showed that _PROTEIN_ localizes in both envelope and stroma fractions in vitro depending on the concentrations of the medium used in chloroplast fractionation _PROTEIN_ localizes predominantly to the envelope fraction in the medium containing a relatively high concentration while it resides predominantly in the stroma fraction with a lower concentration of in the medium . we confirmed this observation in a chloroplast fractionation assay . however it is known that plant tissues contain at levels > mm which should be enough to _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ at the chloroplast envelope . we used a combination of biochemical cellular and molecular approaches to localize this protein in arabidopsis cells . an in situ _METHOD_ labeling assay in the frozen tissues of arabidopsis leaves showed that _PROTEIN_ localizes to the periphery of chloroplasts in planta . an assay of transient _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis protoplasts showed that _PROTEIN_ predominantly resides at the chloroplast envelope . we used chloroplast envelope markers to verify the envelope associated _PROTEIN_ localization which was confirmed by overlapping of the _PROTEIN_ green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ signal with both an inner _PROTEIN_ and an outer _PROTEIN_ chloroplast envelope marker . two classes of biochemical assays chloroplast fractionation combined with immunoblotting detection and in situ immunogold labeling consistently showed chloroplast envelope localization of this protein . an _METHOD_ assay with the isolated intact chloroplasts further showed that whereas the antibodies against either the n or c terminus of _PROTEIN_ recognized _PROTEIN_ on the chloroplast outer surface the antibody against a middle fragment of _PROTEIN_ did not . this revealed that _PROTEIN_ spans the chloroplast envelope with its n and c termini exposed to the _LOCATION_ . assays of transient _PROTEIN_ of the truncated _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein in arabidopsis protoplasts showed that the truncated _PROTEIN_ localizes predominantly to the chloroplasts envelope and the truncated _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ to both envelope and intrachloroplast compartment and the truncated _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ entirely to intrachloroplast compartment . these data suggested that the c terminal transmembrane domain is situated approximately from amino acid residues to . this is essentially consistent with a transmembrane prediction model where several transmembrane domains may occur in the n terminal amino acids to and in the c terminal amino acids to . the _LOCATION_ exposed c and n termini of _PROTEIN_ provide aba signaling with a potential bridge across the chloroplast envelope . we previously showed that the c terminus of _PROTEIN_ binds aba and plays a central role in aba signaling . in a yeast two hybrid screen using the c terminus of _PROTEIN_ as a bait we found an _PROTEIN_ interaction partner that is a wrky transcription _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . we confirmed this interaction using yeast two hybrid and coimmunoprecipitation assays with yeast total protein . the yeast two hybrid assays were performed with a set of truncated proteins of the _PROTEIN_ and showed that the c terminal sequence in _PROTEIN_ is an interaction domain but that the n terminal half of _PROTEIN_ does not interact with _PROTEIN_ . consistently this interacting c terminal domain is exposed to the _LOCATION_ side of the chloroplast indicating that the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ interaction takes place in the c terminal _LOCATION_ portion of _PROTEIN_ . the n terminal half was previously shown to have no aba binding activity but is functionally required for aba signaling likely through a regulatory role of the c terminal half . two closet homologs of _PROTEIN_ viz. _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were shown to interact also with _PROTEIN_ but with an interaction intensity weaker than _PROTEIN_ does . we showed that the wrky a member of the wrky family but with low identity of amino acid sequence with _PROTEIN_ does not interact with _PROTEIN_ indicating the specificity of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ interaction . furthermore we verified the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ interaction in planta with coip assays using plant total protein . the assay with the firefly luciferase complementation imaging confirmed the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ interaction in vivo . the _PROTEIN_ group was previously shown to localize in the _LOCATION_ . we showed that _PROTEIN_ localizes to the _LOCATION_ but mostly to both the _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ in wild type plant cells that contain aba at physiological concentrations by both the stable _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein and immunoblotting of the cellular fractions . in the protoplasts coexpressing the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion proteins we observed the colocalization of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ on the surface of chloroplasts . however in the aba deficient mutant _PROTEIN_ cells _PROTEIN_ resides almost uniquely in _LOCATION_ . this was shown with the same assays as mentioned above for wild type plants . by contrast _PROTEIN_ localization to the chloroplast envelope was not altered in the _PROTEIN_ cells . interestingly while the exogenous aba application downregulated _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ the aba treatment enhanced significantly the amount of _PROTEIN_ in the _LOCATION_ of wild type plant cells and restores the _LOCATION_ distribution of _PROTEIN_ in the _PROTEIN_ cells . these findings reveal that aba is important for the _LOCATION_ distribution of _PROTEIN_ and recruits this transcription _PROTEIN_ from the _LOCATION_ to the _LOCATION_ . in the yeast two hybrid system _PROTEIN_ interacts with _PROTEIN_ without supplementation with aba suggesting that this bimolecular interaction occurs in the absence or low levels of aba . we used a combination of yeast two hybrid and a yellow _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ bimolecular _METHOD_ complementation system and biochemical approaches to investigate this possible aba responsive phenomenon . we found that in the yeast two hybrid system the exogenous aba application specifically promoted _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ interaction as tested by yeast growth and galactosidase activity . by contrast two aba inactive/less active isomers aba and trans aba had no significant effect indicating the specificity of the physiological active form aba for this stimulation . the bifc assays confirming _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ interaction in vivo occurring in the surface of chloroplasts showed that the exogenous aba treatment enhanced apparently _PROTEIN_ wrky interaction in vivo . the coip assays showed clearly that with the exogenous aba treatment the _PROTEIN_ was more efficiently precipitated by _PROTEIN_ and similarly _PROTEIN_ was more efficiently precipitated with _PROTEIN_ . these data showed consistently that aba stimulates _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ interaction . in the bifc system the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ interaction was not detected in the _PROTEIN_ cells but exogenous aba could partly restore this interaction in the mutant cells . the coip assays performed with the same procedures as mentioned above for wild type plants confirmed this observation . these findings together with the observations that aba recruits _PROTEIN_ from the _LOCATION_ to the _LOCATION_ indicate that aba is required for the _PROTEIN_ molecule migration from the _LOCATION_ to the _LOCATION_ where it interacts with the _LOCATION_ portion of _PROTEIN_ . we then tested whether the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ interaction is dependent on functional _PROTEIN_ . the cch mutation in _PROTEIN_ which results in aba insensitivity substantially disrupted the responsiveness of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ interaction to aba in the firefly lci system . the aba treatment did not significantly affect the protein levels of the _PROTEIN_ and mutated _PROTEIN_ harboring the cch mutation indicating that the disruption of the aba responsiveness of the cch mutated _PROTEIN_ was not caused nonspecifically by alteration of its protein levels in the lci system . these data indicate that aba stimulated _PROTEIN_ wrky interaction requires the function of the _PROTEIN_ mediated signaling . the wrky domain proteins are a superfamily of transcription _PROTEIN_ with up to representatives in arabidopsis and the family members appear to be involved in the regulation of plant development and pathogen defense . several wrky proteins were suggested to be involved in aba signaling in creosote bush rice and barley . most recently genetic evidence was provided for the involvement of the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ transcription _PROTEIN_ in regulation of aba signaling . the subgroup of the _PROTEIN_ transcription _PROTEIN_ was previously shown to modulate cooperatively plant defense . in this work we observed that all the knockout mutants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ showed aba hypersensitive phenotypes in aba induced inhibition of seed germination and aba induced postgermination growth arrest with the intensity of the phenotypes _PROTEIN_ > _PROTEIN_ > _PROTEIN_ . the introduction of the native promoter driven cdnas of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ into the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants respectively rescues the aba sensitivities of these mutants demonstrating that these mutations are responsible for the observed aba hypersensitive phenotypes . the double mutant _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ showed the strongest aba hypersensitive phenotypes which was followed by the _PROTEIN_ single mutant and the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ triple mutant both of which showed comparable aba hypersensitivity . these data indicate that _PROTEIN_ plays a more important role than the two other wrkys in aba signaling consistent with its stronger interaction with _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ mutation however repressed the aba hypersensitive phenotypes of the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutations to partly restore wild type growth when combined with either of these two mutations indicating the complexity of the wrky mediated signaling processes . a previous report showed that among the three wrkys _PROTEIN_ plays the most important role in plant defense _PROTEIN_ though _PROTEIN_ binds dna most tightly and that _PROTEIN_ inhibits the binding of _PROTEIN_ to w box acting likely as an antagonist to _PROTEIN_ in plant defense . similarly this experiment showed that _PROTEIN_ is a regulator to balance the _PROTEIN_ mediated aba signaling . due to the essential role of _PROTEIN_ in the wrky mediated aba signaling we focused further detailed analysis on _PROTEIN_ . neither of the wrky mutations changed the concentrations of endogenous aba protoix magnesium protoporphyrin ix or chlorophyll indicating that wrky mediated aba signaling is distinct from the processes of aba metabolism and chlorophyll biosynthesis . the three wrkys are _PROTEIN_ ubiquitously in different organ/tissues including stomata as is _PROTEIN_ supporting their cooperative roles at the whole plant level . no aba related phenotype in stomatal movement was observed in any of the wrky single mutants double mutants and even triple mutants . however we observed that the aba sensitivity of the guard cells of the cch mutant which has stomata strongly insensitive to aba in their movement was restored by introducing any of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ single mutations into the cch mutant . the mechanism underlying this phenomenon needs further study . in addition we introduced the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ single mutations into the two other _PROTEIN_ mutant alleles _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and the transgenic mutant _PROTEIN_ rnai lines and the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutation was introduced into the three _PROTEIN_ mutant alleles cch _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants and the _PROTEIN_ rnai lines . all these mutants combining wrky and _PROTEIN_ alleles showed aba hypersensitivity in aba induced inhibition of seed germination and aba induced postgermination growth arrest resembling their respective original wrky mutants . this reveals that the different wrky mutations suppress the aba insensitive phenotypes caused by the different mutations in _PROTEIN_ gene . these genetic data argue that the wrkys mediate aba signaling downstream of _PROTEIN_ . next we showed that the exogenous aba treatment reduced levels of both _PROTEIN_ mrna _PROTEIN_ test and real time pcr figures to and protein . in the aba deficient _PROTEIN_ mutant cells _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was upregulated at both mrna and protein levels and exogenous aba application repressed this upregulation to restore the wild type _PROTEIN_ level of _PROTEIN_ in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . in the aba signaling mutant cch plants and _PROTEIN_ rnai lines _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was also upregulated as in the _PROTEIN_ cells but this upregulation could not been repressed to restore the wild type _PROTEIN_ level of _PROTEIN_ by exogenous aba application . by contrast _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was constitutively downregulated in the _PROTEIN_ overexpressors as in the aba treated wild type columbia cells . these findings indicate clearly that aba induced _PROTEIN_ downregulation requires the _PROTEIN_ mediated aba signaling . real time pcr analysis showed that the _PROTEIN_ of a set of aba responsive genes was altered in the wrky single and double mutant seedlings . these genes include _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . however the _PROTEIN_ of the genes encoding the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ aba receptors _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was not changed in these wrky mutants . the _PROTEIN_ altered genes were upregulated in the wrky mutants in most cases especially in the _PROTEIN_ single mutant and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant seedlings . it is noteworthy that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were most remarkably upregulated in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant . it is also notable that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was downregulated significantly in the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutant seedlings but upregulated in the _PROTEIN_ single mutant and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant . all these genes are aba positively responsive genes or positive aba signaling regulator genes except for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ which encode two negative aba signaling regulators . however the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ was also upregulated in the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ single mutant and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant like the most positive aba signaling regulator genes . it is interesting to observe that the _PROTEIN_ of the genes involved in the _PROTEIN_ aba receptor mediated signaling cascade _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ was upregulated in some of the wrky mutants . however a recent report showed that aba downregulates _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ slightly upregulates _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and does not significantly alter _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ . given that aba represses _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ and thus disruption of the _PROTEIN_ gene should mimic the effects of aba the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ should have been downregulated or not altered in these wrky mutants . these discrepancies implicate complexity of the aba signaling network and further studies will be necessary to assess if crosstalk occurs between the _PROTEIN_ mediated signaling and _PROTEIN_ mediated signaling . also the results suggest that a complex mechanism involving forward and reverse feedback effects may function and particularly a tightly regulated cooperation among the three wrkys should be important in this _PROTEIN_ wrky mediated signaling pathway which is consistent with the above genetic findings . we further assayed _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in the germinating seeds of the _PROTEIN_ mutant because the two genes are _PROTEIN_ at low level in seedlings after germination . the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ was not altered but _PROTEIN_ was upregulated in _PROTEIN_ mutant suggesting that the regulation of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ by _PROTEIN_ is developmental stage dependent . a search of the arabidopsis genomic sequence showed that several aba signaling genes have in their promoter regions a w box sequence the core of a cis element to which the wrky transcription _PROTEIN_ bind . among these aba signaling regulators _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ both belong to a class of basic leucine zipper transcription _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ to a class of apetala domain transcription _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is a myb related transcription _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ is a rab related protein . the three classes of transcription _PROTEIN_ are considered to be some members of the most important aba regulators in the aba signaling framework . with chromatin coimmunoprecipitation _PROTEIN_ analysis combined with pcr and quantitative real time pcr we showed that _PROTEIN_ binds the promoters of all these genes via the core w box sequence tgac . we further confirmed these _PROTEIN_ promoter interactions for the more important aba responsive transcription _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ with both yeast one hybrid system and gel shift assays . together with the observations that the _PROTEIN_ of these transcription _PROTEIN_ encoding genes was upregulated in the wrky knockout mutants as mentioned above these data indicate that _PROTEIN_ binding to the w box of the promoters represses _PROTEIN_ of many of the most important aba signaling regulator genes . it is noteworthy however that as mentioned above the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ single mutations did not upregulate the _PROTEIN_ gene _PROTEIN_ but the _PROTEIN_ levels of the _PROTEIN_ gene _PROTEIN_ were enhanced in the _PROTEIN_ single mutant and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant . these observations indicate that the regulation of the _PROTEIN_ gene _PROTEIN_ by wrkys involves a complex mechanism involving cooperation among the three transcription _PROTEIN_ that functions to repress _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . next we focused the analysis on _PROTEIN_ because among the other three transcription _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ appears to function in a more complicated manner in the wrky mediated signaling according to the gene _PROTEIN_ analysis . also disruption of _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ has no aba related phenotypes due to functional redundancy . _PROTEIN_ is one of the most important and genetically well characterized aba signaling regulators that control seed germination and postgermination growth . we thus analyzed the function of the _PROTEIN_ promoter interaction in vivo . first we used transformation of the _PROTEIN_ promoter driven gus to confirm the observation by real time pcr analysis . consistently the _PROTEIN_ mutation was shown to enhance remarkably the _PROTEIN_ level of _PROTEIN_ . next we investigated whether _PROTEIN_ directly represses _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ by coexpression of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ promoter in a heterologous system . in the tobacco leaves cotransformed with both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ native promoter luc constructs _PROTEIN_ specifically inhibited _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ . introduction of _PROTEIN_ mutation into the _PROTEIN_ and cch _PROTEIN_ mutants resulted in the aba insensitive phenotypes in seed germination and postgermination growth thus suppressing the aba hypersensitivity of the _PROTEIN_ and cch _PROTEIN_ mutants . taken together our findings consistently show that _PROTEIN_ binds directly to the _PROTEIN_ promoter to repress _PROTEIN_ gene _PROTEIN_ thus _PROTEIN_ functions directly downstream of _PROTEIN_ in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mediated aba signaling .
arabidopsis thaliana ecotype col was used to generate transgenic plants . an _PROTEIN_ gene fragment encoding a truncated _PROTEIN_ with to amino acid residues was introduced into col plants as a _METHOD_ fusion protein . because overexpression of the full length _PROTEIN_ generally induced cosuppression of _PROTEIN_ gene and this truncated _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein functions similarly to full length _PROTEIN_ in plants when it is overexpressed leading to aba hypersensitivity in all the three aba major responses we used the truncated _PROTEIN_ overexpression lines as _PROTEIN_ overexpressors instead of overexpression of full length _PROTEIN_ . the cdna isolation and transgenic manipulation were as previously described . the _PROTEIN_ rnai lines of _PROTEIN_ gene were generated with the same procedures as described previously using col ecotype . briefly a gene specific bp fragment amplified by pcr located downstream to bp of the start codon was used as the sense arm and a bp fragment located downstream to bp of the start codon was used as the antisense arm . the pcr fragments were ligated into vector under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus promoter which was used to transform wild type col plants . the homologous generation seeds or plants were used for analysis . at least transgenic lines were obtained for each construct and all the lines had similar aba related phenotypes . the results from one representative line were presented here . the cch mutant was a generous gift from j. _PROTEIN_ . the seeds of the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants in the _PROTEIN_ gene were obtained from the _PROTEIN_ via the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ project and were characterized as previously described . the _PROTEIN_ allele was identified as an aba insensitive mutant in both seed germination and postgermination growth . the _PROTEIN_ mutant is hypersensitive to aba in seed germination but insensitive to aba in postgermination growth . both alleles have no aba related phenotypes in stomatal movement . the cch _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants were isolated from the ecotype col . the seeds of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutants were also obtained from _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ was obtained from cold spring harbor laboratory gene and enhancer trap lines and contains a ds transposon inserted within the second exon of _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are t dna insertion knockout mutants with a t dna insertion within the first exon respectively in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ genes . both mutants were isolated from col ecotype . all the three mutants were previously identified as null alleles in their respective genes and were confirmed in our laboratory by pcr genotyping . the _PROTEIN_ mutation was transferred from its ler ecotype background into col ecotype by backcrossing as previously described . the aba related phenotypes of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants were complemented by introducing into the mutant plants the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ cdnas respectively driven by their corresponding native promoters _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ that were amplified by pcr . double and triple mutants were generated by genetic crosses and identified by pcr genotyping . the _PROTEIN_ rnai construct was used to transform directly the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutants to downregulate _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in these mutants because we observed that the _PROTEIN_ rnai construct in background wild type col was generally lost in the rnai lines so we could not transfer the _PROTEIN_ rnai construct from transgenic wild type plants into the mutants by crossing . at least rnai lines for each mutant background were obtained . for comparing the rnai lines of the mutant background with those of the wild type col background the _PROTEIN_ levels were checked by real time pcr and immunoblotting to ensure that the rnai lines of different backgrounds have similarly low levels of _PROTEIN_ mrna and protein product . the homologous generation seeds or plants were used for analysis . plants were grown in a growth chamber at to on murashige and skoog _METHOD_ medium at photons or in compost soil at photons over a h photoperiod . we produced proteins of the full length _PROTEIN_ several truncated _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ full length _PROTEIN_ and a truncated _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in e. coli essentially as described previously . the cdnas encoding these proteins were amplified by pcr . for the full length open reading frame of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ the forward primers introduced an ecori restriction site and the reverse primers introduced a sali restriction sites into the fragments and the pcr products were digested and cloned into _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or pgex _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ between ecori and sali sites . for _PROTEIN_ the forward primers introduced an ecori restriction site and the reverse primers introduced an xhoi restriction site into the fragment and the pcr products were digested and cloned into pgex ecori and xhoi sites . the fragments in the plasmids were sequenced to check for _LOCATION_ . the recombinant cdnas were _PROTEIN_ in e. coli strains as tagged fusion proteins or glutathione s transferase tagged fusion proteins . the e. coli strains containing the _PROTEIN_ plasmids were grown at in liter of luria bertani medium containing kanamycin until the of the cultures was to . protein _PROTEIN_ was induced by the addition of isopropyl d thiogalactopyranoside to a final concentration of mm in a condition at with rotations per minute . after h the cells were lysed and proteins purified on a chelating column _PROTEIN_ or sepharose _PROTEIN_ column as described in the manufacture 's system manual . the antisera against _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were produced and tested for specificity as described previously . the extraction of the arabidopsis protoplasts was performed essentially according to procedures described by citation . the extraction of the arabidopsis total protein from leaves or whole plants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and immunoblotting were done essentially according to previously described procedures . the arabidopsis leaves were prepared as frozen sections _PROTEIN_ and immediately fixed with paraformaldehyde at for min . the tissues were then rinsed with _PROTEIN_ solution three times for min each . after the sections were incubated in blocking buffer _PROTEIN_ overnight at they were labeled with the anti full length _PROTEIN_ antiserum diluted fold in a _PROTEIN_ solution supplemented with bsa for h at . after extensive rinsing with _PROTEIN_ the samples were incubated in goat anti rabbit igg fluorescein isothiocyanate antibody diluted fold in a _PROTEIN_ solution supplemented with bsa for h at . the specimens were rinsed in _PROTEIN_ and mounted with glycerol in _PROTEIN_ and observed under a confocal laser scanning microscope . the _METHOD_ of fitc was pseudocolored in green and the _METHOD_ of chloroplasts in red . the specificity and reliability of the immunohistochemical assays were tested . the first control was to omit antiserum to test possible unspecific labeling of the goat anti rabbit igg fitc antibody . the second control was to use rabbit preimmune serum instead of the rabbit antiserum to test the specificity of the antiserum . no substantial fitc signal was observed in either of these negative controls showing that the immunochemical detection was specific to _PROTEIN_ . more than three repetitions of the control experiments were conducted for each sample . transient _PROTEIN_ in the arabidopsis protoplasts was performed essentially with the procedures described by citation . for the transient _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were tagged by _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ was also tagged by mcherry _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . the two chloroplast inner _PROTEIN_ and outer _PROTEIN_ envelope markers were tagged by mcherry and used for observation of precise localization of _PROTEIN_ . the corresponding cdnas were amplified by pcr . the cdnas of _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ fragments _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were driven by the camv promoter and downstream tagged by _METHOD_ . the cdnas of the two chloroplast envelope markers _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were also driven by camv promoter but downstream tagged by mcherry _METHOD_ . each of the promoter driven and _METHOD_ or mcherry tagged cdnas was fused to the pmd t vector at the sphi and ecori sites . the cdna of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was also linked to its genomic native promoter to be transiently _PROTEIN_ in protoplasts and in this case the _PROTEIN_ native promoter was isolated using the forward primer aactgcagagccgtgtgggcttgacttt and reverse primer _PROTEIN_ and cloned into the psti and xbai sites upstream of _METHOD_ in the pmd t vector in which the promoter was replaced by the genomic native promoter of _PROTEIN_ . protoplasts were isolated from the leaves of to week old plants of arabidopsis or from leaves of the aba biosynthesis mutant _PROTEIN_ plants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and transiently transformed using polyethylene glycol essentially according to sheen 's protocol . _METHOD_ of _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ was observed by a confocal laser scanning microscope after incubation at for h. for assaying the effects of aba treatment on the _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ distribution in cells aba at concentration was used to incubate the transformed protoplasts h before the observation under the confocal laser scanning microscope . for stable _PROTEIN_ of the _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis plants the cdna encoding _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ respectively was cloned using the same primers as described above for transient _PROTEIN_ in protoplasts . the cdnas were cloned into the binary vector that contains the camv promoter and a c terminal _METHOD_ flag . these constructs were introduced into the strain agrobacterium tumefaciens and transformed into arabidopsis col plants by floral infiltration . the protoplasts were prepared from the to week old homozygous plants for observation under a confocal laser scanning microscope . for observation of _PROTEIN_ in roots the young roots of the to d old seedlings were directly observed under the confocal laser scanning microscope . for assaying the effects of aba treatment on the _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ distribution in cells aba solution at concentration was used to spray the to week old homozygous plants and the leaves were sampled h after the spraying . the protoplasts were isolated from the aba treated and nontreated plants for observation under the confocal laser scanning microscope . arabidopsis intact chloroplasts were isolated from week old healthy plants essentially as described previously with modifications . all the procedures were performed at . briefly leaves were homogenized in the isolation buffer consisting of mm sorbitol mm mm edta mm and mm hepes/koh ph . the homogenate was filtered and centrifuged and the pellet was resuspended in suspending buffer composed of mm sorbitol mm mm hepes/koh ph and complete protease inhibitor cocktail . the resuspended chloroplasts were loaded onto a two step percoll gradient and were centrifuged in a swinging bucket rotor at for min . the band that appeared between the two phases contained intact chloroplasts and was recovered . the intact chloroplasts were washed with the suspending buffer at a rate of chloroplast to buffer by inverting the tubes carefully . the chloroplasts were centrifuged in a swinging bucket rotor at for min and the pellet was recovered and resuspended in the suspending buffer . the intactness of the chloroplasts was verified by phase contrast microscopy . chloroplast _LOCATION_ and soluble/stroma fractions were prepared essentially as described previously with modifications . briefly the suspended intact chloroplasts obtained as described above were pelleted by centrifugation . the pellets were thus suspended in the sorbitol free suspending buffer and ruptured by homogenization . chloroplast _LOCATION_ were pelleted by ultracentrifugation in a swinging bucket rotor at for min and the supernatant was collected as the chloroplast stroma extract . the stroma fraction was concentrated by ultrafiltration . the recovered _LOCATION_ pellet was solubilized in the suspending buffer supplemented with triton x for h of extraction which gave the chloroplast _LOCATION_ protein fractions for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and immunoblotting . the envelope and _LOCATION_ fractions were separated as described previously with modifications from the chloroplast _LOCATION_ fractions obtained as described above but without the triton x extraction procedure . discontinuous sucrose gradients were prepared in the chloroplast suspending buffer as a m sucrose layer superposed on a m sucrose layer . the chloroplast _LOCATION_ fractions were loaded on the discontinuous sucrose gradients and centrifuged in a swinging bucket rotor at for min . the chloroplast _LOCATION_ were separated into the _LOCATION_ fraction that appeared as a dark green pellet at the bottom of the tube and the envelope fraction that appeared as a yellow band at the interface of the two sucrose layers . the _LOCATION_ fraction was collected and solubilized in the suspending buffer supplemented with triton x for h of extraction . the envelope fraction was collected and diluted in the chloroplast suspending buffer to give to m sucrose and centrifuged in a swing out rotor at for min . the pellet was recovered and solubilized in the suspending buffer supplemented with triton x for h of extraction . the triton x treated _LOCATION_ and envelope fractions were used for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and immunoblotting . the chloroplast inner and outer envelope _LOCATION_ were separated as described previously with modifications . the suspended intact chloroplasts obtained as described above were pelleted by centrifugation at for min . the pellet was suspended in the chloroplast suspending buffer supplemented with m sucrose for a hypertonic treatment for min . the chloroplasts were then subjected to a series of procedures as described above for final isolation of the envelope fraction . the envelope _LOCATION_ fraction obtained as such was used to separate the inner and outer envelope _LOCATION_ . discontinuous sucrose density gradients were prepared in the chloroplast suspending buffer as to to m three sucrose layers . the chloroplast _LOCATION_ fractions were loaded on the discontinuous sucrose gradients and centrifuged in a swinging bucket rotor at for h. the chloroplast envelope _LOCATION_ were divided into the inner _LOCATION_ fraction that appeared between and m sucrose layers and the outer _LOCATION_ fraction that appeared at the interface of the and m sucrose layers . both _LOCATION_ fractions were recovered separately and diluted in the chloroplast suspending buffer to give to m sucrose and centrifuged at for min . the pellet was recovered and solubilized in the suspending buffer supplemented with triton x for h of extraction . the triton x treated fractions were used for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and immunoblotting . all the procedures described above were performed at . chloroplast outer envelope marker toc inner marker tic _LOCATION_ marker _PROTEIN_ and stroma marker _PROTEIN_ were used to characterize purity of the chloroplast fractions . the commercial antibodies against these proteins were _PROTEIN_ from agrisera . for testing the purity of chloroplast _LOCATION_ fraction the inner envelope marker tic _PROTEIN_ was shown to be enriched in this _LOCATION_ fraction while the stroma marker _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was not detected in this _LOCATION_ fraction indicating that the _LOCATION_ fractions were not contaminated by the
