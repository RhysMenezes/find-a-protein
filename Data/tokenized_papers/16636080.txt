_PROTEIN_ homologs and dynamin related proteins uniquely regulate _LOCATION_ division and proliferation . arabidopsis plants possess five _PROTEIN_ homologs designated in this study as _PROTEIN_ b c d and e. transcripts for four _METHOD_ were found in arabidopsis plant parts and in cells in suspension culture by contrast _PROTEIN_ transcripts were found only in developing siliques . within hours after biolistic bombardments myc tagged or _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ a b c d and e individually sorted from the _LOCATION_ directly to _LOCATION_ none trafficked indirectly through the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . both termini of myc tagged _PROTEIN_ b c d and e faced the _LOCATION_ whereas the n and c termini of myc _PROTEIN_ faced the _LOCATION_ and _PROTEIN_ respectively . in _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ transformed cells _LOCATION_ doubled in number . those _LOCATION_ bearing myc _PROTEIN_ but not myc _PROTEIN_ elongated prior to duplication . in cells transformed with _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ elongated without subsequent fission . in _PROTEIN_ transformed cells _LOCATION_ were aggregated and rounded . a c terminal dilysine motif present in _PROTEIN_ d and e was not necessary for _PROTEIN_ induced _LOCATION_ elongation . however deletion of the motif from myc _PROTEIN_ led to _LOCATION_ elongation and fission indicating that the motif in this isoform promotes fission without elongation . in summary all five overexpressed _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ sort directly to peroxisomal _LOCATION_ where they individually promote duplication _PROTEIN_ aggregation _PROTEIN_ or elongation without fission _PROTEIN_ .
blast searches for c. boidinii _PROTEIN_ homologs revealed the existence of five putative arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ proteins _GENE_ _GENE_ _GENE_ _GENE_ and _GENE_ corresponding to _PROTEIN_ b c d and e respectively . all five exhibited amino acid sequence identity with and amino acid sequence identity with human and _PROTEIN_ was the only putative peroxin homolog identified in a blast search against conversely only _PROTEIN_ d and e were identified in blast searches against . no _PROTEIN_ homologs were identified when or trypanosoma brucei _PROTEIN_ were used to search the tair protein database . the amino acid sequence alignment in fig . shows that _PROTEIN_ d and e are highly similar to each other whereas _PROTEIN_ and b are less similar to _PROTEIN_ d and e . _PROTEIN_ and b exhibit identity and similarity to each other . the _PROTEIN_ proteins possess at least three _PROTEIN_ or four _PROTEIN_ predicted transmembrane domains . _PROTEIN_ characteristically possess a peroxisomal _LOCATION_ targeting signal comprising a tmd near a basic cluster of amino acid residues . each _PROTEIN_ sequence possesses at least two basic clusters of amino acid residues that might constitute a portion of a mpts these putative mptss on _PROTEIN_ d and e share high similarity . _PROTEIN_ d and e each possess a c terminal dilysine motif . non quantitative reverse transcriptase pcr was employed to determine which if any of the putative _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis developing siliques roots leaves and/or suspension culture cells . fig . shows that four of the five _PROTEIN_ gene transcripts are _PROTEIN_ in roots leaves and suspension culture cells but _PROTEIN_ transcripts were not . however transcripts for all five genes were detected in silique rna extracts . because of the high degree of similarity among _PROTEIN_ d and e control pcrs were employed in which foreword primers for one _PROTEIN_ gene _PROTEIN_ were paired with reverse primers from another _PROTEIN_ gene _PROTEIN_ . leaf rna was used for the control pcrs . no pcr product was produced from any of these control reactions . shortly after biolistic bombardments transformed cells were examined by _METHOD_ microscopy to determine the sorting pathway and subcellular localization of each overexpressed myc or _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ protein . the earliest time point that proteins were consistently visualized within transformed cells was hours post bombardment . panels a f k and p in fig . show in each transformed arabidopsis or by cell a punctate _METHOD_ pattern resulting from dual immunolabeling with anti myc plus cy conjugated antibodies and anti catalase plus rhodaminex conjugated antibodies . in both cell types myc tagged _PROTEIN_ colocalized with endogenous catalase in _LOCATION_ by contrast myc tagged _PROTEIN_ was not observed in any other organelles _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ at any time point . the general morphology of the _LOCATION_ in these transformed cells is the same as the morphology of _LOCATION_ in neighboring nontransformed cells i.e . rounded or rod shaped . comparisons of these panels also illustrate that _LOCATION_ in arabidopsis cells are characteristically larger and fewer in number per cell than _LOCATION_ in by cells . arabidopsis and by cells overexpressing each of the other four myc _PROTEIN_ proteins also exhibited colocalizations with endogenous peroxisomal catalase . none of these _PROTEIN_ proteins was detected in any other organellar compartment . notably _LOCATION_ in approximately of transformed cells possessing myc _PROTEIN_ or myc _PROTEIN_ at hours were distinctly elongated in arabidopsis and by cells . virtually all of the cells transformed with myc _PROTEIN_ b or e at hours possessed normal _LOCATION_ that were spherical to rod shaped similar to those in surrounding nontransformed cells . in parallel experiments _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ c and d also sorted directly to _LOCATION_ at early hours . our visual observations that arabidopsis _LOCATION_ bearing myc _PROTEIN_ or d were somewhat elongated within about of the transformed cells at hours prompted further examination of _LOCATION_ in these and other myc _PROTEIN_ transformed cells at _PROTEIN_ time points . for a cell transformation and time course control arabidopsis cells were bombarded with a gene encoding chloramphenicol acetyltransferase with an appended c terminal type peroxisomal _PROTEIN_ targeting signal . _LOCATION_ in these transformed cells were used to derive a range of shapes and sizes for non induced _LOCATION_ throughout a gene _PROTEIN_ period of hours . this was the longest time period that cells could be _PROTEIN_ without adverse effects of contamination nutrient deprivation etc . fig . p shows representative micrographs of _LOCATION_ in single transformed cells bearing overexpressed myc _PROTEIN_ d b and cat skl at and hours post bombardment . _LOCATION_ that acquired myc _PROTEIN_ or d became elongated/tubulated and remained as such through hours . visual comparisons of these long _LOCATION_ with the long _LOCATION_ within neighboring wild type or cat skl transformed cells revealed the extent of peroxisomal elongation in myc _PROTEIN_ transformed cells and myc _PROTEIN_ transformed cells . insets with higher magnifications of _LOCATION_ facilitate these visual comparisons . a dramatically different morphological effect was observed for _LOCATION_ that acquired myc _PROTEIN_ . all of these _LOCATION_ assumed a spherical/toric shape which appeared to be a consequence of _LOCATION_ aggregation . fig . shows the percentage of _PROTEIN_ transformed cells possessing elongated _LOCATION_ at various time points . fewer than of _LOCATION_ in cells transformed with cat skl were elongated during the entire gene _PROTEIN_ time period . none of the _LOCATION_ in cells transformed with myc _PROTEIN_ was elongated at any time . a nearly constant low percentage of cells transformed with myc _PROTEIN_ possessed elongated _LOCATION_ . a dramatic difference was apparent in cells transformed with myc _PROTEIN_ or d. as noted earlier at hours post bombardment approximately of the transformed cells possessed elongated _LOCATION_ . within hours approximately of cells transformed with myc _PROTEIN_ or d possessed elongated _LOCATION_ . throughout the rest of the time course essentially the same percentage of these transformed cells possessed elongated _LOCATION_ . cells transformed with myc _PROTEIN_ exhibited a significant difference in the degree of _LOCATION_ elongation . only a small percentage of these transformed cells possessed elongated _LOCATION_ up to hours . thereafter the percentage increased to a peak of at hours followed by a gradual decline to about the same level as cat skl transformed cells . similar overexpression experiments were carried out with untagged versions of _PROTEIN_ d and e. the same morphological results were observed at and hours post bombardment for each isoform indicating that the myc epitope tag did not influence _LOCATION_ morphology . fig . illustrates that myc _PROTEIN_ bearing _LOCATION_ observed at hours post bombardment are mostly spherical or rod shaped . however at hours _LOCATION_ in about of the transformed cells possess clearly elongated _LOCATION_ . these observations are consistent with data presented in fig . . at hours a striking difference was observed in virtually all of the transformed cells on the microscope slides _LOCATION_ in these cells were mostly spherical and visibly more numerous . similar images of spherical proliferated _LOCATION_ were observed in myc _PROTEIN_ transformed cells at hours . at and hours _LOCATION_ bearing myc _PROTEIN_ were rounded/rod shaped and exhibited approximately the same number of _LOCATION_ per cell as cells _PROTEIN_ cat skl . notably at hours the _LOCATION_ were not elongated . at hours virtually all transformed cells on the microscope slides possessed visibly proliferated rounded _LOCATION_ which is remarkably similar to the myc _PROTEIN_ proliferated _LOCATION_ . a similar apparent increase in the number of rounded _LOCATION_ was evident when cells were transformed with a _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ construct . at hours the _METHOD_ rounded/rod shaped _LOCATION_ bearing this chimeric protein apparently were less numerous than they were at hours . fig . j illustrates that _LOCATION_ bearing cat skl and endogenous catalase are colocalized and are rounded/rod shaped at hours like those bearing myc or _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ at hours . the number of _LOCATION_ in the cat skl transformed cell is visibly less than the number of _LOCATION_ in the cells transformed with myc or _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ or myc _PROTEIN_ . these microscopic observations prompted numerical analyses of the perceived peroxisomal multiplications observed in _PROTEIN_ transformed cells . cells transiently transformed with the cat skl construct were used to establish baseline values for _LOCATION_ number in transformed cells at and hours post bombardment . the number of cat skl bearing _LOCATION_ remained virtually constant _LOCATION_ at the three time points . at hours the number of _LOCATION_ bearing myc _PROTEIN_ conformed to the baseline value whereas the number of those bearing myc _PROTEIN_ was approximately double the baseline value _LOCATION_ . at hours the number of _LOCATION_ possessing either myc _PROTEIN_ or myc _PROTEIN_ was approximately doubled _LOCATION_ . the number of myc _PROTEIN_ bearing _LOCATION_ did not change during the next hours of _PROTEIN_ . an independent samples t test confirmed that there was a significant difference between the mean number of _LOCATION_ per in cells transformed with _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ compared with cells transformed with cat skl . there was no significant difference between the numbers of _LOCATION_ in cells transformed with cat skl at the different time points . to validate the statistically significant doubling of myc _PROTEIN_ bearing _LOCATION_ at hours cells were transformed with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . table shows that the number of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ bearing _LOCATION_ was approximately double the baseline value . to determine whether the c terminal dilysine motif was necessary for myc _PROTEIN_ induced peroxisomal elongation and/or duplication myc _PROTEIN_ and myc _PROTEIN_ constructs that lacked their dilysine motifs were produced . at and hours _LOCATION_ bearing myc _PROTEIN_ were elongated as were _LOCATION_ bearing the wild type protein . conversely _LOCATION_ bearing myc _PROTEIN_ exhibited a time dependent change in morphology not observed for _LOCATION_ bearing myc _PROTEIN_ . at hours _LOCATION_ bearing myc _PROTEIN_ were rounded/rod shaped similar to _LOCATION_ bearing the wild type protein . at hours _LOCATION_ bearing myc _PROTEIN_ were elongated unlike the rounded _LOCATION_ bearing the wild type protein construct . at hours myc _PROTEIN_ bearing _LOCATION_ were no longer elongated but were rounded and visibly increased in number per cell similar to _PROTEIN_ bearing _LOCATION_ at or hours . hence unlike _LOCATION_ in cells transformed with myc _PROTEIN_ those in cells transformed with myc _PROTEIN_ elongated prior to duplication . to determine the topological orientation of peroxisomal myc _PROTEIN_ proteins in vivo digitonin was applied to permeabilize _LOCATION_ but not peroxisomal _LOCATION_ of cells transformed with genes encoding c or n terminal myc tagged _PROTEIN_ b c d or e. fig . c j shows _METHOD_ from _LOCATION_ in individual myc labeled cells transformed with each of the genes . notably no _METHOD_ was observed in cells transformed with _PROTEIN_ myc . as expected variations in _LOCATION_ morphology and number were apparent among the different transformed cells hence appendage of the myc epitope to the n or c terminus did not produce variant peroxisomal morphology . fig . t shows results of anti catalase/rhodamine _METHOD_ labeling in the same dual immunolabeled cells depicted in fig . j . in all cases anti catalase/rhodamine _METHOD_ signals from the transformed cells were not observed indicating that anti catalase iggs were not accessible to the peroxisomal _PROTEIN_ . combined these results indicated that the n termini of each myc tagged _PROTEIN_ homolog and the c termini of _PROTEIN_ c d or e immunoreacted with anti myc antibodies present in the _LOCATION_ only . the myc _PROTEIN_ protein was _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis cells as a control to verify that a n terminal myc epitope tag facing the peroxisomal _PROTEIN_ was inaccessible to anti myc/cy antibodies in digitonin treated cells this orientation for myc _PROTEIN_ was shown previously in by cells . fig . v shows that transformed cells permeabilized with digitonin and dual immunolabeled with anti myc/cy and anti catalase/rhodamine antibodies exhibit no _METHOD_ . confirmation of myc _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in transformed cells is shown in fig . x where anti myc/cy and anti catalase/rhodamine labeled _LOCATION_ are visualized in samples from the same batch of cells permeabilized with triton x . as another positive control for digitonin permeabilization cells from the same myc _PROTEIN_ transformation experiment were incubated in digitonin and dual immunolabeled with anti tubulin plus cy conjugated and anti catalase/rhodamine antibodies . _METHOD_ images of cortical microtubules in the cytoplasm but not of peroxisomal _PROTEIN_ catalase confirmed that incubation in digitonin permeabilized _LOCATION_ and not peroxisomal _LOCATION_ .
