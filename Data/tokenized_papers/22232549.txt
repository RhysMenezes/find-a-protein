heterotrimeric g proteins consisting of and subunits play important roles in plant development and cell signaling . in arabidopsis in addition to one prototypical g protein subunit _PROTEIN_ there are three extra large g proteins _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ of largely unknown function . each extra large g protein has a c terminal like region and a amino acid n terminal extension . here we show that the three xlg proteins specifically bind and hydrolyze _PROTEIN_ despite the _PROTEIN_ that these plant specific proteins lack key conserved amino acid residues important for _PROTEIN_ binding and hydrolysis of _PROTEIN_ in mammalian proteins . moreover unlike other known proteins these activities require instead of as a cofactor . yeast two hybrid library screening and in vitro protein pull down assays revealed that _PROTEIN_ interacts with the _LOCATION_ protein _PROTEIN_ . electrophoretic mobility shift assays show that _PROTEIN_ binds to dna in vitro in a non sequence specific manner and that _PROTEIN_ bound _PROTEIN_ promotes the dna binding activity of _PROTEIN_ . overexpression of _PROTEIN_ results in early flowering . combined overexpression of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ enhances this early flowering phenotype and elevates _PROTEIN_ of the floral pathway integrator genes _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ but does not repress _PROTEIN_ of the floral repressor _PROTEIN_ . chromatin immunoprecipitation assays show that _PROTEIN_ increases _PROTEIN_ binding to _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ promoters . thus a dependent g protein _PROTEIN_ promotes _PROTEIN_ dna binding activity for a subset of floral integrator genes and contributes to floral transition .
the c terminal regions of xlgs contain domains which in heterotrimeric g proteins mediate _PROTEIN_ binding and hydrolysis . however some amino acids conserved in the g to g domains of proteins are not conserved within the corresponding domains of xlg proteins . particularly amino acids in the regions of the g and g domains which are involved in coordination _PROTEIN_ binding and subsequent _PROTEIN_ hydrolysis are not conserved . this raised the question of whether or not xlg proteins are able to bind and hydrolyze _PROTEIN_ . we addressed the biochemical properties of the three xlg proteins using _PROTEIN_ binding and _PROTEIN_ assays . results were similar for all three xlg proteins results for _PROTEIN_ are reported here and those for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are described in supplemental figs . . to examine specific _PROTEIN_ binding and _PROTEIN_ activities we purified and assayed recombinant _PROTEIN_ and xlg proteins fused with and trx . as expected _PROTEIN_ bound _PROTEIN_ rapidly in the presence of illustrating the known dependence of proteins on this divalent cation . however _PROTEIN_ did not bind _PROTEIN_ under these conditions . to address whether _PROTEIN_ has a preference for other divalent cations over for _PROTEIN_ binding activity _PROTEIN_ binding filter assays were performed in the presence of instead of . interestingly the presence of promoted _PROTEIN_ binding of _PROTEIN_ whereas in the absence of any divalent ion there was no _PROTEIN_ binding to _PROTEIN_ . by contrast _PROTEIN_ showed weaker _PROTEIN_ binding in the presence of as compared with . similar to _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ also bound _PROTEIN_ in the presence of . these results indicate that xlg proteins prefer over as a cofactor for their _PROTEIN_ binding activities . to confirm the specificity of _PROTEIN_ binding pcr based mutagenesis was used to generate a mutation in the g domain of _PROTEIN_ a residue which is essential for binding to the phosphate moieties of guanine nucleotides . similar mutations have been reported to abolish the _PROTEIN_ binding activity of other g proteins . for example the mutation of rice protein eliminates _PROTEIN_ binding . mutations of mammalian and of also impair _PROTEIN_ binding and create a dominant negative phenotype . we designated this mutant protein _PROTEIN_ this protein was also tagged with n terminal and trx . _PROTEIN_ binding by _PROTEIN_ protein was greatly reduced . as expected purified trx control protein did not show any _PROTEIN_ binding activity . analogous mutations reduced the _PROTEIN_ binding of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . because heterotrimeric g protein subunits including arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ have intrinsic _PROTEIN_ activity we examined the _PROTEIN_ activity of _PROTEIN_ using thin layer chromatography in the presence of various divalent cations . although _PROTEIN_ like mammalian subunits exhibited the greatest hydrolytic activity in the presence of _PROTEIN_ showed little or no _PROTEIN_ activity under this condition . in contrast _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ activity was observed in the presence of although this activity was less than that of _PROTEIN_ in the presence of . as expected no _PROTEIN_ activity was observed for the mutant form of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ activity of _PROTEIN_ protein which has no tag was similar to that of trx tagged _PROTEIN_ indicating that trx tag does not affect the _PROTEIN_ binding and _PROTEIN_ activities of xlg c terminus proteins . the specificity of the _PROTEIN_ activity of _PROTEIN_ was also addressed . when a fold excess of cold _PROTEIN_ gdp or _PROTEIN_ was added to the reaction _PROTEIN_ had the greatest competitive effect indicating that _PROTEIN_ specifically binds _PROTEIN_ . the full length _PROTEIN_ protein exhibited only slightly increased _PROTEIN_ activity compared with _PROTEIN_ c terminus protein suggesting that the n terminal region of _PROTEIN_ is dispensable for the _PROTEIN_ activity . similar results were observed for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . to address the functions of xlgs we used a yeast two hybrid screen to identify proteins that interact with _PROTEIN_ . one _PROTEIN_ interacting protein recovered from the screen was _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ encodes a predicted protein of amino acids with a plant specific dna binding domain and a _LOCATION_ localization signal . _PROTEIN_ shows an overall identity with _PROTEIN_ in its amino acid sequence . _PROTEIN_ is a plant specific like dna binding domain protein that is required for _PROTEIN_ of vernalization mediated _PROTEIN_ repression and also promotes flowering in a vernalization independent manner . to identify the domains of _PROTEIN_ that are responsible for _PROTEIN_ binding we used partial cdnas for additional yeast two hybrid assays . both full length _PROTEIN_ and the c terminus of _PROTEIN_ interacted with _PROTEIN_ but the n terminus of _PROTEIN_ did not indicating that the c terminus of _PROTEIN_ is responsible for the interaction in yeast . interestingly the _PROTEIN_ mutant proteins _PROTEIN_ full length and _PROTEIN_ which do not bind _PROTEIN_ did not show any interaction with _PROTEIN_ in yeast suggesting that _PROTEIN_ interacts with _PROTEIN_ in a _PROTEIN_ dependent manner . these results were further confirmed by in vitro pull down assays using recombinant proteins . we found that trx _PROTEIN_ but not trx _PROTEIN_ binds to _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in vitro . thus the _PROTEIN_ binding activity of _PROTEIN_ appears to be required for its interaction with _PROTEIN_ . given the sequence similarity between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ we also tested whether _PROTEIN_ interacts with xlgs using the yeast two hybrid assay . however _PROTEIN_ did not interact with any of the three xlgs . we used co immunoprecipitation to test the protein protein interaction between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in vivo . total proteins were extracted from wild type _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ double overexpressing lines . protein extracts were immunoprecipitated with anti _PROTEIN_ antibody as probe and then protein gel blotting was performed to detect _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ with anti _METHOD_ antibody . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was detected in the proteins from _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ double overexpressing plants immunoprecipitated with anti _PROTEIN_ antibody . in control experiments _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was not detected in the proteins immunoprecipitated with anti _PROTEIN_ antibody from wt or from _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plants confirming the physical interaction of _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ in plant cells . given that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ interact in planta they would be expected to show identical or overlapping subcellular localization . all xlg proteins including _PROTEIN_ have a _LOCATION_ localization sequence and localize to the _LOCATION_ as observed in transient _PROTEIN_ assays . we carried out transient _PROTEIN_ assays to ascertain the localization of _PROTEIN_ which also has a predicted _LOCATION_ localization sequence . the green _METHOD_ signal from _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ overlaps with the red _METHOD_ from the _METHOD_ tagged nls peptide indicating that _PROTEIN_ localizes to the _LOCATION_ . we applied several complementary approaches to assess _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ patterns . rt pcr analysis showed that similarly to _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ throughout the plant including in roots _METHOD_ leaves flowers and cauline leaves . we then used reporter gene analysis to examine _PROTEIN_ patterns in more detail . histochemical gus staining of gus lines showed that _PROTEIN_ is strongly _PROTEIN_ in cotyledon shoot apical meristem radicle root tip and staminar filaments . given the sequence similarity between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and thus a possible role of _PROTEIN_ in vernalization response we also examined mrna _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ during the course of vernalization treatment . rna blot analysis showed that mrna _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ but not of _PROTEIN_ is increased after a week cold treatment . up regulation of _PROTEIN_ by a week cold treatment was also observed using gus . stronger _PROTEIN_ of gus was observed in plants that experienced a long term cold treatment compared with a control without cold treatment . to further dissect the increased level of _PROTEIN_ mrna we performed quantitative real time rt pcr using samples subjected to cold treatments ranging from h to weeks . the mrna level of _PROTEIN_ was rapidly increased almost fold within h of cold treatment and then _PROTEIN_ below the level of no cold treatment after h of cold treatment . _PROTEIN_ mrna _PROTEIN_ eventually increased again fold after a week cold treatment . _PROTEIN_ mrna also exhibited the rapid increase within h of cold treatment and the _PROTEIN_ after h of cold treatment . unlike _PROTEIN_ however the level of _PROTEIN_ mrna remained unchanged after a week cold treatment . the ectopic _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ causes early flowering due to the activation of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . we accordingly examined flowering times of transgenic plants overexpressing _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plants exhibited rapid flowering under sd and a slight acceleration of flowering under _PROTEIN_ . in addition when _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plants were vernalized flowering was further accelerated . because _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ interact we also evaluated the flowering time of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ double overexpression lines . interestingly double overexpressor _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ plants showed earlier flowering under _PROTEIN_ and sd compared with both wt and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plants with or without vernalization treatment . thus the interaction between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ appears to enhance _PROTEIN_ activity in vivo . to investigate the molecular basis of this early flowering phenotype we examined the _PROTEIN_ of floral pathway genes in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ overexpression lines and in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ double overexpression lines under sd using quantitative rt pcr . introduction of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ alone did not promote transcript levels of the floral pathway genes _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . however the abundance of these transcripts was increased in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plants and even more so in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ plants . vernalization triggers the repression of _PROTEIN_ and other _PROTEIN_ clade genes . mrna levels of _PROTEIN_ and its clade genes _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ plants immediately after vernalization showed no significant difference compared with vernalized wild type in the extent of this repression . after vernalization however the floral pathway integrator genes _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and particularly the levels of _PROTEIN_ mrna were higher in these lines than in col . to analyze the effect of ft mutation on the flowering time of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ plants _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ construct was transformed into the ft mutant and flowering times were determined . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in the ft mutant background had the same _PROTEIN_ flowering phenotype as ft mutants indicating that early flowering of _PROTEIN_ requires the elevated _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ . therefore accelerated flowering of overexpressing _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ plants apparently occurs directly through regulation of the floral pathway integrator gene _PROTEIN_ through a mechanism independent of repression of _PROTEIN_ and its clade genes . _PROTEIN_ shows a non sequence specific dna binding activity in vitro . given the sequence similarity between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and the _LOCATION_ localization of _PROTEIN_ we examined the dna binding activity of recombinant _PROTEIN_ protein . _METHOD_ were performed using dna fragments derived from promoters of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ . recombinant _PROTEIN_ protein bound to all dna fragments tested . these dna fragments do not share any common sequence motif illustrating that similar to _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ has non sequence specific dna binding activity at least in these in vitro assays . the interaction between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ prompted us to hypothesize that this interaction may modulate the dna binding activity of _PROTEIN_ . accordingly recombinant _PROTEIN_ c terminal domain protein _PROTEIN_ which contains the _PROTEIN_ interaction domains was added in the reaction with _PROTEIN_ and the binding strength was evaluated by the amount of probe retardation . the addition of _PROTEIN_ increased the dna binding activity of _PROTEIN_ whereas the mutant protein _PROTEIN_ which fails to interact with _PROTEIN_ did not . because _PROTEIN_ mutant protein also fails to bind _PROTEIN_ in vitro we examined the effect of _PROTEIN_ binding of _PROTEIN_ on the dna binding activity of _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and were added in the reaction together with _PROTEIN_ . under these conditions _PROTEIN_ formed a supercomplex with _PROTEIN_ and probes suggesting that activation of _PROTEIN_ by _PROTEIN_ binding contributes to the enhanced dna binding of _PROTEIN_ in vitro . we showed that _PROTEIN_ overexpression lines show early flowering due to increased _PROTEIN_ of floral pathway integrator genes independent of regulation of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and that _PROTEIN_ binds to dna in a non sequence specific manner in vitro . to address whether _PROTEIN_ binds to promoters of floral pathway integrator genes such as _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in vivo _PROTEIN_ assays were employed . for these assays wild type _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ double overexpresssing lines were used . after immunoprecipitation with anti _PROTEIN_ or anti _METHOD_ antibodies enrichment of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ promoter regions was assayed by quantitative pcr . as shown in fig . b and c enrichment of the _PROTEIN_ promoter region bp upstream from the start codon was observed in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ line with slightly enhanced enrichment in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ overexpression lines . in addition _PROTEIN_ promoter regions were not enriched in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ whereas enrichment of the _PROTEIN_ promoter region bp upstream from the start codon was observed from the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . no enrichment of _PROTEIN_ regions was observed in either the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ line or the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ line . taken together our results indicate that _PROTEIN_ promotes the dna binding activity of _PROTEIN_ specifically to promoter regions of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in vivo and thus leads to the activation of floral integrator genes .
