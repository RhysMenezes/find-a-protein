a new homology search algorithm identifies novel kash protein family members in arabidopsis that act at the _LOCATION_ envelope in _LOCATION_ positioning and innate immunity .
plant genomes do not encode any homologues of known opisthokont kash proteins . the kash domains of opisthokont kash proteins and plant wips terminate in a c terminal aa motif which is critical for interacting with the sun domain and for ne localization . however the kash domains of plant wips and of animal kash proteins share little amino acid similarity . even among plant wips the composition of the kash domain varies significantly except for the c terminal aa and in particular the terminal _PROTEIN_ . thus we define a protein sequence as a putative kash domain when it fulfills all of the following it is immediately c terminal of a transmembrane domain its length is between and aa and it is the c terminus of a protein and terminates in four amino acids with a given amino acid pattern . a java program called _PROTEIN_ was developed to search for putative kash domain containing proteins according to these rules . in addition we argued that if a putative kash domain is present in most members of a protein family it is more likely to be a bona fide kash domain . therefore blastp was used to obtain homologues of a positive output from _PROTEIN_ in the ncbi nr database value < are considered as homologues . we first ran this method on the a. thaliana proteome using xxpt as the c terminal aa pattern . four putative kash candidates were and they are all plant specific . and are paralogues in a. thaliana and are conserved across land plants . has close homologues in arabidopsis lyrata and in the closely related species capsella rubella and has distant homologues in other dicots . has only one homologue each in a. lyrata and c. rubella . amino acid sequence alignment of the c terminal domains of predicted plant kash proteins . amino acid sequence alignment of homologues homologues homologues and homologues . full length protein sequences were used for the alignment and only the c termini are shown . aly a. lyrata ata aegilops tauschii bdi brachypodium

filled circles indicate proteins predicted not to have a tmd by phobius . clustalx color was assigned to the alignments . analyzing the last aa of these five candidates and their homologues revealed a new pattern of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . this pattern was used to search the nr database for putative kash proteins in plants . seven new protein families were identified . the protein family shown in was identified only in medicago truncatula and one homologue was subsequently cloned from medicago sativa . the protein families shown in fig . were only found in poaceae . this search also came across a mammalian protein family which has a conserved tmd followed by a short sequence terminating in a conserved llp motif . among these candidates we chose and for verification and named them and respectively because of their putative sun domain binding properties and ne localizations . we also cloned a homologue of the protein family shown in from m. sativa for verification . to determine the subcellular localization of the chosen plant kash candidates transgenic wild type a. thaliana lines were generated that _PROTEIN_ n terminally _METHOD_ tagged proteins under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus promoter . root tip cells of d old seedlings were imaged by confocal microscopy and at least three lines for each construct were analyzed . as shown in all five fusion proteins were associated with the ne . subcellular localization of predicted plant kash proteins . _METHOD_ tagged and under control of the promoter were stably _PROTEIN_ in wild type or _PROTEIN_ ko _PROTEIN_ kd respectively . _METHOD_ tagged and driven by the promoter were stably _PROTEIN_ in wild type a. thaliana . root tip cells were imaged using confocal microscopy . bars . _METHOD_ signal is shown in green . images in the second column of a are overlays of _METHOD_ and transmitted light images . cell to cell variability of _METHOD_ fusion protein abundance was seen in all images . the nli was calculated and compared . as illustrated in the top of d two maximum ne intensities and two maximum cytoplasmic intensities _PROTEIN_ along a random line across a cell were chosen to calculate the nli which equals / _PROTEIN_ . asterisks in d represent significant statistic differences when compared with _METHOD_ tagged wild type sines in wild type a. thaliana . _LOCATION_ bars show _METHOD_ . next we tested the ability of and to interact with _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . pairs of tagged proteins were transiently _PROTEIN_ under the control of the promoter in nicotiana benthamiana leaves and coimmunoprecipitation assays were performed . to determine the importance of the c terminal aa of each candidate deletions of these amino acids were introduced and the resulting mutant proteins were designated as and respectively . to test whether the putative kash domains of and are essential for sun protein interaction they were replaced with rfytksaeaaaaa rfytksaeaaaa and rfytksaeaaaaaa

is . in d and f the vertical black lines represent the removal of empty intervening lanes for presentation purposes . _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ was transiently coexpressed with n terminally myc flag tagged _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . ip assays were performed with an anti _METHOD_ antibody . as shown in myc flag _PROTEIN_ was strongly coimmunoprecipitated with _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ but barely with _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ . a similar co ip procedure was performed to test the interaction of myc _PROTEIN_ with and their respective mutants . as shown in myc _PROTEIN_ was strongly coimmunoprecipitated with _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ weakly with _METHOD_ and barely with _METHOD_ _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ . these data indicate that the putative kash domain and the c terminal aa are important for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ binding . to test whether the sun domain of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ is necessary for this interaction co ip assays were performed with _PROTEIN_ deletion mutants and . myc was coexpressed with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ myc _PROTEIN_ . as a negative control the unrelated _METHOD_ nls _METHOD_ _LOCATION_ export signal fusion protein was used . after ip using an anti _METHOD_ antibody coimmunoprecipitated myc was detected by an anti myc antibody . as shown in only the two sun domain deletions were unable to coimmunoprecipitate myc . to further analyze sun domain specificity of the protein protein interactions we introduced two point mutations in the sun domain of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . based on the amino acid sequence alignment of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and homo sapiens _PROTEIN_ two conserved residues in the kash binding pocket were chosen and mutated in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . the mutated proteins were named _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ respectively . after n. benthamiana coexpression and co ip the ability of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ to bind myc or myc was determined . as shown in in contrast to wild type sun proteins both mutated proteins barely interacted with either or confirming that the kash binding pocket within the sun domain is required for interaction . shows the comparable co ip assays performed for _METHOD_ tagged and and their respective mutants tested for interactions with myc tagged _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . ips were performed with an anti _METHOD_ antibody and coimmunoprecipitated proteins were detected with an anti myc antibody . shows a schematic representation of and their putative kash domain mutants . shows that strongly binds to _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ but that deletion of the c terminal aa replacement of the putative kash domain or mutating the kash binding pocket of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ disrupts this binding . similar results were obtained for and for . losing interaction with a sun protein leads to mislocalization of nesprin nesprin nesprin and _PROTEIN_ . to determine whether this is true for _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ they were stably _PROTEIN_ in a. thaliana under the control of the promoter . shows that all five _METHOD_ fusion proteins were only weakly associated with the _LOCATION_ periphery and were abundantly found in the cytoplasm and/or associated with the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and components of the endomembrane system . this demonstrates that the c terminal aa are required for efficient association of all five proteins with the ne . to compare the ne localization quantitatively we defined an ne localization index as the sum of two maximum ne intensities divided by the sum of two maximum cytoplasmic intensities _PROTEIN_ . the higher the nli the more concentrated at the ne the signal is . as shown in deleting the c terminal aa of the sun domain interacting ne proteins significantly reduced their enrichment at the ne when compared with wild type proteins . finally _METHOD_ tagged and were _PROTEIN_ in a _PROTEIN_ knockout _PROTEIN_ knockdown _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant respectively . shows that protein mislocalization similar to the deletion of the c terminal aa was also observed in the _PROTEIN_ ko _PROTEIN_ kd mutant which is reflected by the nli in . protein interactions will reduce the mobility of a _LOCATION_ protein and frap can assay this mobility difference . by _PROTEIN_ proteins in n. benthamiana leaves the mobility at the ne of _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ with or without coexpression of atsun proteins was quantified by comparing maximum recovery values of frap . as shown in the mobility of _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ was significantly reduced when they were coexpressed with either _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ . coexpressing _PROTEIN_ with either or or coexpressing _PROTEIN_ with had no effect consistent with the finding that mutating the sun domain disrupts binding in co ip assays . a slight _PROTEIN_ in maximum recovery was detected when _METHOD_ was coexpressed with _PROTEIN_ . it is possible that _PROTEIN_ retains some affinity for _METHOD_ which was not resolved by the co ip assay . together these data indicate that and interact with _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ at the plant ne . frap analysis of the interaction between and atsun . _METHOD_ protein fusions of and sun proteins were transiently _PROTEIN_ in n. benthamiana leaves and protein mobility was studied by frap . recovery curves of _METHOD_ alone or _METHOD_ coexpressed with _METHOD_ flag _PROTEIN_ or _METHOD_ flag _PROTEIN_ respectively . recovery curves of _METHOD_ alone or _METHOD_ coexpressed with _METHOD_ myc _PROTEIN_ or _METHOD_ myc _PROTEIN_ respectively . recovery curves of _METHOD_ alone or _METHOD_ coexpressed with _METHOD_ flag _PROTEIN_ or _METHOD_ flag _PROTEIN_ respectively . recovery curves of _METHOD_ alone or _METHOD_ coexpressed with _METHOD_ myc _PROTEIN_ or _METHOD_ myc _PROTEIN_ respectively . color coded asterisks after each curve indicate that the maximum recovery of that curve shows a statistically significant difference when compared with the black curve whereas color coded circles after each curve indicate no statistical significant difference . _LOCATION_ bars represent _METHOD_ . no known domains are predicted in the newly confirmed kash proteins by interproscan except for and which contain armadillo repeats in their n termini . because and are also the only known kash proteins conserved across land plants we investigated them in greater detail . to analyze the _PROTEIN_ profiles of and we _PROTEIN_ n terminally _METHOD_ tagged and driven by their own promoter _METHOD_ _METHOD_ in stably transformed wild type a. thaliana . in leaves confocal z stack images show that was exclusively _PROTEIN_ in guard cells and guard cell mother cells whereas was _PROTEIN_ in epidermal cells mesophyll cells and trichomes but only weakly in guard cells . both and are _PROTEIN_ in roots without any obvious differences . these _PROTEIN_ patterns were also recapitulated in a. thaliana lines transformed with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ or _METHOD_ gus . _PROTEIN_ and protein localization pattern of and in leaves . is _PROTEIN_ in guard cells and guard cell mother cells and the protein is localized to fibers in guard cells . is _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in epidermal cells and mesophyll cells and weakly in guard cells . the images are maximum intensity projections of a z stack image . _METHOD_ of chloroplasts are shown in red and overlaid with the _METHOD_ signal . bars . in the overlay images asterisks indicate the _LOCATION_ observed and p letters indicate stomatal pores enclosed by pairs of guard cells . _PROTEIN_ and protein localization pattern of and in trichomes and roots . _PROTEIN_ and protein localization pattern of in trichomes and roots . _PROTEIN_ and protein localization pattern of in trichomes and roots . both genes are _PROTEIN_ in root cells but only is _PROTEIN_ in trichomes . both proteins are localized at the ne . the trichome image of _METHOD_ was taken with higher laser power than that used for _METHOD_ as indicated by the _METHOD_ from the trichome cell wall . for the differentiated root cells the _LOCATION_ surface was imaged to compare the fiber structure of _METHOD_ and relatively evenly distributed signal of _METHOD_ . bars . diff. differentiated undiff. undifferentiated . interestingly _METHOD_ labeled a spotted fiberlike pattern at the ne and in the cytoplasm of guard cells and guard cell mother cells . in root cells the fiberlike pattern was more prominent at the ne . however showed no fiberlike localization pattern in either leaves or roots . because arm repeats are predicted in the n termini of and the n terminal aa of and the n terminal aa of were fused to _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and transiently _PROTEIN_ in n. benthamiana leaves under the control of the promoter . _METHOD_ was localized to cytoplasmic fiberlike structures . we then coexpressed _METHOD_ with an f actin marker _METHOD_ lifeact or a microtubule marker _METHOD_ in n. benthamiana leaves . as shown in _METHOD_ was colocalized with _METHOD_ lifeact but not with _METHOD_ . the colocalization of _METHOD_ with _METHOD_ lifeact was also observed in root cells of stably transformed a. thaliana . in contrast _METHOD_ did not decorate fiberlike structures in n. benthamiana leaves and neither did the fusion of a larger n terminal fragment excluding the tmd kash domain . both _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ had similar localization to the soluble protein _METHOD_ nls _METHOD_ nes . this suggests that associates with f actin and that this property is not shared with . association of with f actin filaments . _METHOD_ was transiently coexpressed with _METHOD_ lifeact or _METHOD_ in n. benthamiana leaves showing that _METHOD_ was colocalized with _METHOD_ lifeact but not _METHOD_ . _METHOD_ was transiently coexpressed with _METHOD_ lifeact in n. benthamiana leaves but _METHOD_ was localized to the cytoplasm instead of f actin fibers labeled by _METHOD_ lifeact . _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ lifeact were colocalized in root cells of stably transformed a. thaliana plants . bars . because the arm repeats of are associated with f actin we reasoned that the ne fibers decorated by _METHOD_ are likely associated with and/or depend on f actin . rhodamine phalloidin staining of the guard cells _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ showed that _METHOD_ was colocalized with rhodamine phalloidin labeled fibers . after treatment with latrunculin b for h the ne fibers disappeared . in contrast in the mock treatments the ne fibers were barely affected . next we investigated whether the mobility of and at the ne was affected by actin depolymerization . as measured by frap latb treatment increased the mobility of _METHOD_ in guard cells but had no effect on the mobility of _METHOD_ consistent with a specific interaction between and f actin at the guard cell ne . association of with f actin filaments in guard cells . _METHOD_ is colocalized with rhodamine phalloidin labeled filaments in a. thaliana guard cells . the fibers in both guard cells and root cells are sensitive to h treatment of latb but the fibers are still visible in the mock treatment . the images of guard cells are maximum intensity projections of a z stack image . the differentiated root cell _LOCATION_ were imaged at the _LOCATION_ surface . frap recovery curves of _METHOD_ with or without latb triggered f actin depolymerization . a. thaliana lines stably transformed with _METHOD_ driven by the promoter were used for frap . the asterisk indicates a significant statistical difference of the maximum recovery compared with the black curve . _LOCATION_ bars represent _METHOD_ . bars . to probe into the biological roles of and three transfer dna insertion mutants and two t dna insertion mutants were isolated . further analysis showed that at least one downstream gene is missing in which was therefore discarded

primers amplified the full length coding sequences are listed in table . example of measuring _LOCATION_ position in guard cells . an ellipse was rendered on a pair of guard cells and the acute angle between the center of the _LOCATION_ and the minor axis was measured . mean guard cell _LOCATION_ positions determined by the angle shown in c. blue asterisks p < when compared with wild type after blue light treatment blue circles p > when compared with wild type after blue light treatment black asterisks p < when compared with wild type without blue light treatment black circles p > when compared with wild type without blue light treatment . two tailed t test was used and n . quantification of conidiophore formation on the cotyledon adaxial side as a measure of hpa growth on the indicated genotypes . values are means _PROTEIN_ of three biological replicates each with n . asterisks indicate significant differences to wild type and circles represent no significant differences to wild type . one way analysis of variance followed by tukey s honest significant difference test was used . because is predominantly _PROTEIN_ in guard cells we examined guard cell _LOCATION_ positioning . the leaf epidermis was peeled and immediately fixed in paraformaldehyde containing hoechst . an ellipse was rendered on a pair of guard cells and the acute angle between the minor axis of the ellipse to the center of the _LOCATION_ was used to quantify the position of the _LOCATION_ . only guard cell pairs with a major axis of the rendered ellipse longer than were measured . to avoid stomatal aperture effects on _LOCATION_ position we irradiated the leaves with blue light to open stomata before fixation . pairs of guard cells were measured for each line . in wild type the guard cell _LOCATION_ predominantly localized at the center of each cell and this positioning was not affected in . however in mutants containing homozygous or alleles the position of the _LOCATION_ skewed toward a greater distance from the center of a guard cell . we then measured the _LOCATION_ position without blue light illumination . as shown in similar results were obtained suggesting that stomatal aperture has little effect on _LOCATION_ positioning in guard cells . guard cell _LOCATION_ position was also affected in _PROTEIN_ ko _PROTEIN_ kd and was similar to that of . next we measured the guard cell _LOCATION_ position in complemented by _METHOD_ . three lines were analyzed and in all cases _METHOD_ rescued the _LOCATION_ position of as shown in . importantly latb treatment also affected guard cell _LOCATION_ position and recapitulated the effect . mock treatment showed no effect . these data strongly suggest that the atsun complex is involved in centrally anchoring the paired guard cell _LOCATION_ in an f actin dependent manner likely by direct or indirect interaction of the arm repeats with f actin . upon contact with plant cells filamentous plant pathogens develop haustoria sophisticated feeding structures that form a specific _LOCATION_ interface with the host cell . haustorium formation leads to structural rearrangements in the attacked host cell and this involves migration of the _LOCATION_ toward the infection site . to suppress plant immunity pathogens translocate effector proteins into host cells several of which are targeted to the host cell _LOCATION_ . we therefore tested whether immunity to the a. thaliana downy mildew pathogen hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis is altered in and mutants . d old seedlings were infected with hpa isolate that infects col and the severity of the infection was quantified by counting the conidiophores that emerged from the upper side of the cotyledons d after infection . as shown in and were more susceptible to hpa than wild type but behaved like wild type . _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ in the double mutant complemented the enhanced disease susceptibility phenotype in two independent transgenic lines . these results suggest that but not contributes significantly to plant immunity against hpa .
please refer to fig . b for details of _PROTEIN_ and supplemental material . the protein models were downloaded from tair . the nr database is constantly updated which affects the results of our program and ncbi blastp . the one used here was downloaded on february . to develop the c terminal aa pattern of plant kash proteins we searched the a. thaliana protein models using our program with pattern xxpt . five protein models were identified and . homologues of newly identified plant kash candidates were obtained using ncbi blastp on june and the tmd prediction program phobius was used to support the existence of a tmd . for convenience the geninfo identifier _PROTEIN_ number is used to represent the corresponding protein in this study . if the majority of a protein family terminates in a putative kash domain this protein family was considered a positive candidate . among the five protein models identified and were positive candidates . has one homologue in a. thaliana two in a. lyrata and one in c. rubella . two a. thaliana homologues do not possess a putative kash domain . it was therefore considered a false positive . analyzing the c terminal aa of homologues of _PROTEIN_ and revealed a new pattern of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . this pattern was used to search the nr database for putative kash proteins in plants using _PROTEIN_ . we performed blastp using the protein sequence of and against individual nonplant _METHOD_ such as h. sapiens mus musculus caenorhabditis elegans drosophila melanogaster s. pombe and saccharomyces cerevisiae and no homologues were found . we also performed blastn using genomic sequence of and and against nonplant genomes and obtained no hits . these results suggest that all sines are indeed plant specific and they could not have been identified by homologous searches such as blastn or blastp . for the animal kash protein search homologues of known animal kash nesprin nesprin klarsicht unc and obtained by blastp . sequences containing no proline in the c terminal aa were submitted to blastp and removed if the closest homologue was not a kash protein . the c terminal aa pattern _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or very rarely _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ was derived from the final kash protein pool . pattern _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was used to search for putative animal kash proteins . all alignments were performed by using mafft with default settings and the e ins i strategy except for the alignment in fig . g for which the g ins i strategy was used . while searching for homologues of newly identified putative kash proteins we found many proteins share high similarities at the n termini but lack a putative kash domain . some of these cases were a result of a probably mispredicted intron and were then corrected based on

_PROTEIN_ / _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in which in is normalized _METHOD_ intensity _PROTEIN_ is _METHOD_ intensity immediately after the bleach and _PROTEIN_ is the mean prebleach _METHOD_ . normalization was used to allow comparison and analysis of each individual frap experiment as ne _METHOD_ is variable in both transiently and stably transformed cells . for each sample the normalized data were fitted to an exponential equation of best fit using prism and half time and maximum recovery were calculated . statistical analysis was performed in excel . the frap raw data are shown in fig . . leaves of d old a. thaliana plants were ground in liquid nitrogen and total rna was extracted using rneasy plant mini kit . first strand cdna was synthesized using superscript iii first strand synthesis system and oligo dt as a primer . primers used for pcr were listed in table . a. thaliana seedlings were immersed in the gus staining solution _PROTEIN_ and mm x _PROTEIN_ vacuum infiltrated for min and incubated at for h. staining solution was then removed and the seedlings were washed with several changes of ethanol until the tissue was cleared . seedlings were imaged under a dissecting microscope _PROTEIN_ or compound microscope with a lens using water as a medium at room temperature . a camera was used to capture images which were organized in photoshop and illustrator . leaves of wk old a. thaliana plants were used for the _LOCATION_ position measurement in guard cells . to open stomata newly fully expanded leaves were detached put on a piece of wet filter paper in a petri dish and irradiated with of blue light for h. the lower epidermis was then peeled off and fixed and stained in paraformaldehyde _PROTEIN_ buffer containing hoechst for min . after this fixation and staining the leaves were imaged using a digital camera . leaves without blue light treatment were fixed stained and imaged in the same way except for the _METHOD_ transformed lines which were imaged directly on a confocal microscope using the _METHOD_ from _METHOD_ . nis elements software was used for the _LOCATION_ position measurement . an ellipse was first rendered on a pair of guard cells using the five point ellipse tool . the major axis of the ellipse was aligned to the common boundary of the two guard cells . if the major axis was equal to or longer than the angles between the minor axis and the middle of the _LOCATION_ were measured using the free angle tool . a. thaliana seedlings were grown as described by . d old seedlings were sprayed with spores/ml hpa isolate until the leaf surface was completely covered with spore solution . after infection seedlings were kept for d under a sealed transparent lid to _PROTEIN_ high humidity at and h day/night cycles . to quantify conidiophores seedlings per genotype were submerged in a solution of uvitex followed by a wash in a higher volume of water . conidiophores emerging from the adaxial cotyledon side were counted using a _METHOD_ stereomicroscope with a uv filter . fig . shows amino acid sequence alignment of the c terminal domains of wip family members and a flow chart of _PROTEIN_ . fig . shows amino acid sequence alignment of the c terminal domains of predicted kash protein families not verified in this study . fig . shows _PROTEIN_ pattern of and in leaves and roots . fig . shows that but not is associated with f actin . fig . shows raw data of the frap analyses performed in this study . table provides primers used for cloning . table provides primers used for rt pcr analyses and genotyping . the
