_LOCATION_ trafficking plays a fundamental role in eukaryotic cell biology . of the numerous known or predicted protein components of the plant cell trafficking system only a relatively small subset have been characterized with respect to their biological roles in plant growth development and response to stresses . in this study we investigated the subcellular localization and function of an arabidopsis small _PROTEIN_ belonging to the rabe family . rabe proteins are phylogenetically related to well characterized regulators of _PROTEIN_ vesicle transport from the _LOCATION_ apparatus to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ in animal and yeast cells . the rabe family of _PROTEIN_ has also been proposed to be a putative host target of avrpto an effector protein produced by the plant pathogen pseudomonas syringae based on yeast two hybrid analysis . we generated transgenic arabidopsis plants that constitutively _PROTEIN_ one of the five rabe proteins fused to green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ . _METHOD_ and endogenous rabe proteins were found to be associated with the _LOCATION_ apparatus and the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ in arabidopsis leaf cells . rabe down regulation due to cosuppression in transgenic plants resulted in drastically altered leaf morphology and reduced plant size providing experimental evidence for an important role of rabe _PROTEIN_ in regulating plant growth . rabe down regulation did not affect plant susceptibility to pathogenic p. syringae bacteria conversely _PROTEIN_ of the constitutively active enhanced plant defenses conferring resistance to p. syringae infection .
we conducted a screening of two separate arabidopsis cdna libraries using avrpto as bait . several avrpto interacting arabidopsis proteins were identified including a member of the rabe family of small _PROTEIN_ a putative cytoplasmic kinase an auxin signaling repressor _PROTEIN_ two hypothetical proteins and several putatively chloroplast or mitochondria targeted proteins . the interaction with the small _PROTEIN_ rabe was particularly interesting because rabe was predicted to be _LOCATION_ localized as is avrpto and as mentioned above because screening of a tomato cdna library had also yielded two avrpto interacting proteins homologous to _PROTEIN_ the mammalian counterpart of arabidopsis rabe . to characterize the specificity of the avrpto rabe interaction we investigated whether avrpto interacts with other members of the rabe family and with other rab proteins . of the other arabidopsis rab protein families we cloned and _PROTEIN_ in yeast _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ none of these representatives interacted with avrpto in the system . of the five rabe genes all but _PROTEIN_ were successfully cloned and _PROTEIN_ in yeast . all four rabe proteins tested interacted with avrpto . thus it appears that avrpto interacts specifically with the arabidopsis rabe family of _PROTEIN_ . small _PROTEIN_ normally cycle between the active _PROTEIN_ bound and the inactive gdp bound states . mutation of highly conserved residues can be used to alter the nucleotide binding and hydrolysis activities of rab proteins . the mutant _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ were engineered . in the system avrpto interacted only with wild type or with _PROTEIN_ restricted but not with gdp restricted suggesting that avrpto preferably binds to the active form . analysis of the arabidopsis genome showed that of the rab genes reside in duplicated regions . of the five rabe genes and appear to be derived from a major duplication event between chromosomes iii and v and the same holds true for _PROTEIN_ and . the high degree of sequence identity among the five rabe proteins equal to or higher than suggests functional redundancy . however members of a gene family could be preferentially _PROTEIN_ in different tissues at specific developmental stages or in response to stresses . we used the genevestigator gene atlas tool to investigate whether this is the case with the five rabe genes . the in silico analysis revealed that all five genes are _PROTEIN_ in all arabidopsis tissues and developmental stages . and are the only two gene family members whose _PROTEIN_ is much lower in pollen than in all other tissues . based on publicly available microarray data appeared to be the most highly _PROTEIN_ rabe gene in arabidopsis ecotype columbia rosette leaves followed by _PROTEIN_ . the and genes had the lowest _PROTEIN_ levels . we conducted reverse transcription pcr analysis on rosette leaf total rna and confirmed a high _PROTEIN_ level for . to investigate potential up or down regulation of the rabe family members in response to pathogens or other stresses we analyzed the _PROTEIN_ patterns of the rabe genes with the atgenexpress visualization tool across several publicly available microarray data sets . none of the five genes appeared to be significantly up or down regulated in response to pathogens or elicitors . in the absence of any _PROTEIN_ based indication of whether the five rabe proteins have redundant or distinct functions we chose the highly _PROTEIN_ for further study . all rab proteins are normally present in cells in two pools one cytoplasmic and the other _LOCATION_ associated . nucleotide binding state and interaction with accessory proteins determine whether a rab is in the _LOCATION_ or the _LOCATION_ at any given time . a hallmark feature of rab proteins is that they localize to the specific _LOCATION_ compartments in which they function . it was previously reported that arabidopsis when transiently and heterologously _PROTEIN_ in tobacco epidermal cells as a fusion with yellow _METHOD_ protein was detected in the _LOCATION_ apparatus and in the cytoplasm . to determine rabe localization in native arabidopsis cells we created stable transgenic plants that _PROTEIN_ fused with enhanced _METHOD_ under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus promoter . by convention _METHOD_ was fused to the n terminus of to preserve the c terminal caax geranylgeranylation site that is critical for _LOCATION_ association and function . several independent transgenic lines were analyzed by confocal laser scanning microscopy _PROTEIN_ . _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was observed not only in intracellular punctate structures consistent with the _LOCATION_ apparatus as detected in heterologous tobacco cells but also prominently at the cell periphery . leaf epidermal cells typically contain a very large _LOCATION_ that accounts for most of the cell volume . _METHOD_ detected at the cell periphery may represent the pm the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ or the thin layer of cytoplasm that is between the pm and the tonoplast . to more precisely determine whether _METHOD_ was also localized at the pm we stained live leaf tissue with the lipophylic dye . produces a bright red _METHOD_ in _LOCATION_ but not in aqueous solutions and is rapidly incorporated into the pm . it is often used in microscopy as an endocytic tracker because it is retained in the portions of pm that are internalized by endocytosis . within the first to min after incorporation selectively stains the pm . _PROTEIN_ analysis revealed a precise overlap of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ with _METHOD_ immediately after staining indicating that is associated with the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . to investigate whether the punctate structures labeled by _METHOD_ correspond to the _LOCATION_ apparatus we examined colocalization with rat sialyl transferase a _LOCATION_ marker protein fused to dsred _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was transiently _PROTEIN_ in the _METHOD_ transgenic leaves via particle bombardment . observation of cells coexpressing _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ revealed overlapping _METHOD_ signals confirming 's association with the _LOCATION_ apparatus . taken together our analysis of _METHOD_ localization revealed that in the native arabidopsis leaf cells _LOCATION_ associated is found not only in the _LOCATION_ apparatus as reported previously in heterologous tobacco cells but also in the pm . _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in the transgenic plants was driven by the cauliflower mosaic virus constitutive promoter . to exclude the possibility that the observed rabe localization reflects patterns of only the transgenically _PROTEIN_ protein we conducted additional analyses to determine the localization of endogenous rabe in transgenic as well as wild type arabidopsis plants . we performed subcellular _LOCATION_ fractionation by centrifugation of clarified plant extracts on suc step gradients . this method allowed separation of the pm from fractions containing lighter _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . western blot analysis with an anti rabe polyclonal antibody that reacts with all rabe family members revealed that the bulk of _LOCATION_ associated endogenous rabe proteins as well as transgenically _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were in the same fraction as the pm marker h _PROTEIN_ . a lower amount of endogenous rabe as well as _METHOD_ cofractionated with xylosyl transferase _PROTEIN_ a _LOCATION_ apparatus resident protein . a tonoplast marker tonoplast integral protein _PROTEIN_ was found predominantly in the same fraction as the _LOCATION_ marker . independent _LOCATION_ fractionation experiments yielded similar results although minor differences in protein levels and distribution among fractions were occasionally observed across western blots as a result of interexperiment variability . overall the _LOCATION_ fractionation experiments complemented the live cell imaging results together they indicate that endogenous and ectopically _PROTEIN_ rabe proteins are not only localized at the _LOCATION_ apparatus but that the majority of _LOCATION_ associated rabe is in the pm in arabidopsis leaf cells . we also produced transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ which is predicted to be constitutively active as a _METHOD_ fusion . unlike wild type _METHOD_ the _METHOD_ fusion was not detected in intracellular punctate structures _LOCATION_ but was primarily found at the cell periphery . pm staining with revealed that the bulk of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ did not overlap with the pm but was most likely localized in the tonoplast . we obtained from the arabidopsis biological resource center arabidopsis transgenic lines _PROTEIN_ various endomembrane markers fused to _METHOD_ . comparison of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ with that of either a pm localized channel protein or a tonoplast marker revealed a localization pattern similar to that of the tonoplast both in intact and in plasmolyzed leaf tissues . plasmolysis in line resulted in the characteristic hechtian strands typical of _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ retracting from the cell wall in mesophyll cells the chloroplasts were clearly located on the inside of the _METHOD_ labeled pm . in contrast plasmolyzed cells _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ did not display hechtian strands and chloroplasts in the mesophyll cells were distinctly on the outside of the _METHOD_ labeled _LOCATION_ further supporting localization in the tonoplast . to investigate whether intracellular distribution of the protein was perturbed in the presence of bacteria we performed microscopic observation of transgenic _METHOD_ plants _PROTEIN_ with various strains of pst . leaves were syringe inoculated with bacteria at colony forming units and analyzed by _PROTEIN_ at to h after inoculation . we observed that bacterial inoculation caused _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ accumulation in mesophyll cells . interestingly whereas such a phenomenon was restricted to a few sparse cells in leaves _PROTEIN_ with wild type virulent pst or with the nonpathogenic ttss defective mutant focal accumulation of _METHOD_ was widespread in leaves inoculated with the avirulent strain pst . these results suggest that the _METHOD_ subcellular localization is dynamic and can respond to bacterial infection especially in a gene for gene interaction . a large percentage of _METHOD_ transgenic arabidopsis plants generated in this study showed cosuppression of the transgene and of endogenous rabe as demonstrated by western blot analysis . severe reduction of the endogenous rabe protein level in transgenic plants invariably correlated with a distinct morphological phenotype . rosette leaves developed normally for the first weeks when arabidopsis development is usually slower and plants were indistinguishable from col plants . in the following weeks when arabidopsis size increases more rapidly the leaves of rabe cosuppressed plants did not fully elongate midribs remained short while the leaf lamina continued to expand producing a characteristic wavy phenotype . mature rabe cosuppressed plants were significantly smaller than wild type plants and had short midribs and petioles . rabe cosuppressed plants flowered at the same time as wild type arabidopsis although their _METHOD_ were much shorter than wild type _METHOD_ and the plants produced fertile seeds . the progeny of selected silenced lines _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ silencing and had the same phenotype as the parental plants . _PROTEIN_ of the rabe gene family was analyzed by rt pcr in the cosuppressed lines and compared with _PROTEIN_ in wild type plants . rt pcr demonstrated that not all rabe gene family members are equally affected by cosuppression . and _PROTEIN_ were knocked down most severely followed by _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . showed only slight down regulation . given the high degree of sequence similarity among small _PROTEIN_ of the arabidopsis rab superfamily we tested whether other closely related rabs were affected by silencing . the closest relatives of the rabe clade in arabidopsis are the four rabd proteins _PROTEIN_ . rabd was previously characterized as a regulator of the early secretory pathway being involved in transport from the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ to the _LOCATION_ . rt pcr revealed that transcripts of all four rabd genes were present at similar levels in silenced plants and in wild type arabidopsis . silencing in the transgenic plants therefore is specific and limited to the rabe genes primarily and . we performed pathogenesis assays with pst to establish whether the partially rabe cosuppressed plants are impaired in their defenses against p. syringae . pst consistently caused disease _METHOD_ and multiplied on rabe cosuppressed plants reaching similar population levels as on wild type arabidopsis . in several instances however we observed that older or environmentally stressed rabe cosuppressed plants displayed some degree of basal resistance possibly due to stress caused by rabe down regulation . we did not observe a consistent and reproducible difference between wild type col plants and rabe cosuppressed plants in the multiplication of pst or a ttss defective mutant of pst the mutant . _METHOD_ rabe plants did not exhibit significant alterations in growth and development other than the appearance of minute sparse indentations in mature rosette leaves about weeks prior to bolting . the origin and significance of these indentations are unclear however we have been unable to show using trypan blue staining that they develop as a consequence of cell death . although transgenic _PROTEIN_ of constitutively active _METHOD_ did not globally affect plant growth or development it had a remarkable effect on plant responses to p. syringae infection . upon _PROTEIN_ with pst the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ plants displayed a considerable degree of resistance reflected by bacterial multiplication being consistently restricted compared with multiplication on wild type arabidopsis . this observation was consistent across several experiments on different transgenic lines . visible disease _METHOD_ namely chlorosis and necrosis were also markedly reduced . this enhanced resistance phenotype apparently requires the constitutively active form of as transgenic _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ did not result in enhanced resistance . up regulation of the secretory pathway was recently demonstrated in systemic acquired resistance and plants undergoing sar accumulate secreted proteins in the apoplast including antimicrobial polypeptides . because rabe proteins are predicted to be involved in regulating secretory vesicle trafficking the enhanced resistance to pst in _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ plants could be caused by constitutive stimulation of defense associated secretion . to test this possibility arabidopsis wild type and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ plants were sprayed with benzothiadiazole a synthetic activator known to trigger sar in plants or with water as a control . three days _PROTEIN_ total protein secretion in the apoplast and secretion of the _LOCATION_ defense protein _PROTEIN_ were monitored . intercellular wash fluid collected from water treated _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ plants contained _PROTEIN_ and several unknown proteins that were absent from the water treated arabidopsis wild type iwf indicating a constitutive activation of secretory and defense pathways . bth application resulted in similar levels of secreted _PROTEIN_ and several other proteins in the apoplast of both wild type and transgenic plants . interestingly some protein bands were exclusively detected in the iwf of water and bth treated _PROTEIN_ plants but not in the bth treated wild type plant iwf . these unique _LOCATION_ proteins associated with _PROTEIN_ of suggest that other secretory pathways in addition to the sar pathway are activated in these plants .

infected and uninfected landsberg _LOCATION_ plants were screened . the avrpto coding sequence was amplified from pst genomic dna by pcr and cloned into pnlexa to serve as bait in the screen . we
