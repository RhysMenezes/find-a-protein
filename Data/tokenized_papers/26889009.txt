arabidopsis thaliana _PROTEIN_ is involved in proper alignment of the cell division plane and root elongation and is required for preventing micronuclei formation .
we isolated an a. thaliana mutant by screening for mutants defective in root growth . the phenotype was confirmed in the generation and the mutant line was termed _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ carried a single recessive mutation responsible for the phenotype . to characterize the root growth of _PROTEIN_ in detail we measured the root length of the mutant almost every day up to dag . the primary root length of _PROTEIN_ was about two thirds that of the wild type throughout the growth period . assuming constant growth rates of the roots the average growth rate of _PROTEIN_ was of that in the wild type . although _PROTEIN_ appeared to develop fewer _PROTEIN_ roots at dag microscopic observation revealed that the number of emerged _PROTEIN_ roots per primary root length did not differ significantly between the wild type and _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ exhibited smaller shoots compared with the wild type growth of the _PROTEIN_ mutant . seven dag seedlings from the wild type and _PROTEIN_

at p < by welch s t test . the root growth rate was determined by meristem activity and cell expansion . to evaluate meristem activity we estimated the cell number in root _METHOD_ . the meristematic zone was defined as the area between the _PROTEIN_ and the first elongating cortical cell . to estimate the boundary between the meristem and the elongation zone quantitatively we measured the lengths of all cortical cells from the _PROTEIN_ to the elongation zone in dag seedlings . the data suggested that the average cell length starts to increase at the and cells from the _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ and the wild type respectively . the different positions of the initiation of cell elongation indicate that the number of meristematic cells was reduced in _PROTEIN_ . root cell organization of

lengths of the root cells we measured the cell length in the mature region of _PROTEIN_ and wild type roots . no significant difference was observed in mature cell length between _PROTEIN_ and wild type roots . propidium iodide _PROTEIN_ stained seedlings were observed at dag using a confocal microscope . the cellular organization in the root _METHOD_ differed between the wild type and _PROTEIN_ . in _PROTEIN_ the cell files in the root _METHOD_ were partially disordered with the occurrence of non canonical periclinal cell divisions . these periclinal cell divisions were observed with a higher frequency in the cortex endodermis and epidermis compared with the wild type . these extra cell files were observed locally and discontinued from each initial suggesting that these defective patterns were not caused by the abnormal periclinal cell division of stem cells . in addition _PROTEIN_ stained dead cells were observed with higher frequency in the epidermis cortex endodermis and stele of _PROTEIN_ compared with the wild type . proportions of seedlings in which extra periclinal cell divisions were observed meristem zones in dag seedlings were observed . values are _PROTEIN_ as

cor cortex epi epidermis st stele n the number of seedlings analysed . to identify the causal gene for the root growth defect in _PROTEIN_ we conducted map based cloning . _PROTEIN_ was crossed with ler and its population was used for genetic mapping . molecular genetic analysis of individual plants was performed using col and ler genetic markers and the _PROTEIN_ locus was mapped to a region on bac clone on chromosome in a region that contained eight predicted genes . the genomic sequences of the region corresponding to the open reading frames of the eight genes were determined and only one mutation was found in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ with no mutations in the other genes . the mutation was located in the end of the fifth intron in a predicted splicing acceptor site . the nucleotide sequence of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mrna was determined by rt pcr and sequence analysis revealed that splicing of the fifth intron of _PROTEIN_ occurred improperly in _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ mrna contained an additional in the mutant establishing that intact _PROTEIN_ protein was not produced in _PROTEIN_ . positional identification of the mutation responsible for _PROTEIN_ . molecular markers and the

mutation in _PROTEIN_ is indicated in bold and the extra exon is underlined . note that the extra exon causes a shift in the reading frame . to confirm that the mutation in _PROTEIN_ caused the _PROTEIN_ phenotype we obtained a tagged line allele with a t dna insertion in _PROTEIN_ and isolated a line with the homozygous t dna insertion . we detected no intact _PROTEIN_ transcript in the tagged line and the allele exhibited similar defects in root growth and radial organization to _PROTEIN_ . we designated _PROTEIN_ and the t dna allele as _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ respectively . in addition we conducted a complementation experiment by _PROTEIN_ a _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein under the control of the upstream region of _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ . we constructed two types of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion proteins one with genomic _PROTEIN_ and the other with _PROTEIN_ cds . for each construct we obtained two independent transformants homozygous for the t dna insertion in the generation . all homozygous lines generated were tested for their growth and all lines recovered root elongation . in addition root radial organization was recovered in both lines . to investigate the tissue specificity of the _PROTEIN_ promoter activity we generated col background transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ reporter gene under the control of the _PROTEIN_ promoter region which was identical to the fragment used in the complementation test . we generated eight independent transformants and staining of their generation revealed that seven of the eight lines exhibited similar staining patterns . here we describe one of the representative transgenic plants among the seven lines . seedlings at dag were gus stained to observe the _PROTEIN_ patterns in the early stages . gus staining was observed in cotyledons hypocotyls and roots . in roots strong staining was observed in the stele . at dag staining was observed _PROTEIN_ in the vascular tissue in both roots and shoots with strong staining in young leaves . in the primary roots gus staining was observed _PROTEIN_ in the stele _PROTEIN_ and several cells surrounding the _PROTEIN_ . weak or no gus staining was

elongated _PROTEIN_ roots but not in the proximal meristem . we investigated _PROTEIN_ protein localization using _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion in the transgenic _PROTEIN_ lines used for the complementation test . driven by its own promoter _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion showed the strongest _METHOD_ in the _METHOD_ in these transgenic plants which became weaker towards the elongation zone and columella cells . higher magnification revealed a strong and uniform signal near the cell periphery which was absent from the central portion of the cells suggesting cytoplasmic localization of the fusion protein . in mature regions of the roots significant _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was not observed . tissue specific _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein . three dag seedlings of transformants

root tips with higher magnification . mature region with root hair . bars . to investigate the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ during each cell cycle stage further we visualized dna by dapi staining and observed _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ localization in meristematic epidermal cells . during interphase and prophase of cell division _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was observed in the _LOCATION_ but not inside _LOCATION_ . from metaphase to telophase _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was uniformly localized in cells including the area where chromosomes were observed . subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein during cell division . three dag seedlings of transformants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in were observed using confocal microscopy . dna was stained with dapi and root meristematic epidermal cells in each cell division phase were observed . bar . the aberrant cell division and cell death in _PROTEIN_ mutant root _METHOD_ motivated us to consider the possibility of cell cycle disruption . _LOCATION_ of dag root _METHOD_ were stained with sybr green i which revealed that of _PROTEIN_ and of _PROTEIN_ seedlings had at least one cell with micronuclei in longitudinal confocal sections of root _METHOD_ whereas no micronuclei were observed in any wild type seedlings . the frequency of cortical cells with micronuclei were in the wild type in _PROTEIN_ and in _PROTEIN_ that suggested defects in chromosomal separation in the _PROTEIN_ mutants . to obtain a further hint on the possible involvement of _PROTEIN_ in cell cycle progression we visualized _LOCATION_ during dna synthesis phase by pulse labelling using the thymidine analogue edu and calculated the percentage of cortical cells in m or s phase in confocal sections of the root _METHOD_ . both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ exhibited slight but significantly higher proportions of mitotic cells whereas those in the s phase did not differ significantly between _PROTEIN_ mutants and the wild type . quantitative rt pcr revealed that _PROTEIN_ mrna whose accumulation is specific to the _PROTEIN_ to m transition accumulated in roots of _PROTEIN_ mutants to a significantly higher level than in the wild type . these results suggest the involvement of _PROTEIN_ in cell cycle progression . micronucleus formation in _PROTEIN_ mutants . in root _METHOD_ of dag seedlings _LOCATION_ were
