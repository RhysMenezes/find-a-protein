nac proteins are plant specific transcriptional regulators . _PROTEIN_ was one of the first identified nac proteins in arabidopsis . in present study we characterized the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and biological function in response to water deficit stress . _PROTEIN_ mrna _PROTEIN_ was strongly induced by dehydration and abscisic acid treatment but inhibited by water treatment suggesting a general role in drought stress responses . transient _PROTEIN_ analysis in onion epidermal cells indicated the _LOCATION_ localization for the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein . yeast transactivation analysis showed that _PROTEIN_ had ability to activate reporter gene _PROTEIN_ . furthermore domain deletion analysis revealed that the _PROTEIN_ transactivation activity was conferred by its c terminal domain . when _PROTEIN_ gene was knocked out by t dna insertions arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants displayed a recovery rate about seven times higher than wild type plants in drought response test . this _PROTEIN_ phenotype was coincident with the enhanced _PROTEIN_ of stress responsive marker genes such as _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ under drought stress . above evidences suggest that _PROTEIN_ as a transcriptional regulator negatively regulates the _PROTEIN_ of stress responsive genes under drought stress in arabidopsis .
a full length _PROTEIN_ cdna was obtained by reverse transcription pcr . a comparison between the cdna and genomic dna sequences revealed that the _PROTEIN_ gene consists of three exons and two introns . _PROTEIN_ is predicted to encode a amino acid protein with an estimated molecular _METHOD_ of kda . to investigate the physiological role of the _PROTEIN_ a reverse genetics approach was employed . two different _PROTEIN_ insertion alleles are registered in the salk institute genomic analysis laboratory t dna _PROTEIN_ database and we obtained these lines named _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ from the nottingham arabidopsis stock centre . both t dna mutant alleles were inserted in the third intron of _PROTEIN_ . the insertions were identified in homozygous plants harboring the _PROTEIN_ gene knockout alleles by pcr . plants homozygous for the _PROTEIN_ mutation were identified by segregation analysis using the resistance marker kanamycin . pcr analysis of plants carrying a homozygous insertion consistently yielded a single band using the combination of gene specific and t dna border primers however as a result of the large insert size no band was found using the two gene specific primers . two week old wt _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ seedlings were exposed to drought stress on filter paper for h. reverse transcript pcr analysis demonstrated that the two insertion alleles abolished _PROTEIN_ transcript _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ knockout mutant plants indicating that these _PROTEIN_ alleles _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were null . we did not observe a significant phenotypic change in _PROTEIN_ mutant plants compared with wild type plants under normal growth conditions in the growth chamber suggesting that _PROTEIN_ may not function in normal plant growth and development . these findings are consistent with a low _PROTEIN_ level of _PROTEIN_ in adult plants under normal conditions . it is well known that _PROTEIN_ is a nac protein . to further characterize the function of the _PROTEIN_ protein under abiotic stress five known stress responsive nac domain proteins in arabidopsis were used for alignment . multiple sequence alignment was performed using the clustalw . boxshade was produced by boxshade . from this alignment it was clear that the _PROTEIN_ protein contains the nac conserved domain in its n terminal region which is further divided into five subdomains . however the c terminal region is highly divergent from other known nac domain sequences . this suggests that _PROTEIN_ may play different roles with these five nac proteins in response to stress . phylogenetic analysis revealed that _PROTEIN_ belongs to the _PROTEIN_ subfamily which includes seven nac genes in arabidopsis and can be further divided into two clades . among these genes _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ have been reported to respond to abiotic stresses . however the three members are not within the same clade in the phylogenetic tree containing _PROTEIN_ . this implied that the functions of _PROTEIN_ are likely to differ from those of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in abiotic stress responses . phylogenetic analysis also indicated that the closest relative of _PROTEIN_ is the nac protein encoded by _GENE_ whose mrna _PROTEIN_ was putatively induced by multiple abiotic stresses in previous microarray data analyses . however the detailed biological function of _GENE_ remains unknown . to identify the function of the _PROTEIN_ gene under abiotic stress we initially carried out rna blot analysis to verify whether _PROTEIN_ gene _PROTEIN_ is regulated by drought stress . three week old arabidopsis plants were subjected to water and dehydration as shown in fig . . we detected low level of _PROTEIN_ mrna _PROTEIN_ under normal condition . however _PROTEIN_ mrna was almost undetectable after water treatment at or h indicating that the _PROTEIN_ transcript was inhibited by . notably _PROTEIN_ transcript levels were highly up regulated by dehydration treatments . at all time points transcript levels were higher in dehydration treated samples than in the untreated controls . _PROTEIN_ transcript levels began to increase within h of dehydration treatment and reached the maximum after h. because drought stress can induce the accumulation of aba _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was further investigated in response to exogenous aba by quantitative real time rt pcr . the results indicated that the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ was also induced by aba treatment . similar to drought treatment aba treatment significantly increased _PROTEIN_ transcript levels within h and reached a maximum after h . these findings suggest that the _PROTEIN_ gene product is a drought and aba inducible protein and may importantly contribute to arabidopsis thaliana response to drought stress . nac family proteins contain a highly conserved domain within the n terminus which may function as a potential _LOCATION_ localization signal . _PROTEIN_ is a putative nac domain transcription _PROTEIN_ . however the subcellular localization of the _PROTEIN_ protein is unknown . to investigate the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ protein the coding region of _PROTEIN_ was fused in frame at its c terminus with the _METHOD_ marker . this construct was co bombarded into onion epidermal cells where the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein was _PROTEIN_ under the control of the camv promoter . the subcellular localization of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein was determined by visualization under a confocal microscope . in control cells the _METHOD_ signal was consistently observed within both the cytoplasm and _LOCATION_ . in contrast the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein was located exclusively within the _LOCATION_ in the cells examined indicating that _PROTEIN_ is a _LOCATION_ localized protein . although a fragment of the _PROTEIN_ protein lacking amino acids from the n terminus was previously mentioned to have transactivation activity by personal communication to date the data have not been published . therefore we further examined the transcription activation activity of the full _PROTEIN_ protein using a yeast _PROTEIN_ system . the yeast strain was transformed with the fusion plasmids pbd _PROTEIN_ pbd _PROTEIN_ n pbd _PROTEIN_ c and pbd . the growth status of these transformants was subsequently evaluated . figure demonstrates that the yeast cells containing pbd _PROTEIN_ and pbd _PROTEIN_ c grew well in the sd medium lacking histidine whereas cells containing pbd _PROTEIN_ n and pbd did not . in the presence of bromo chloro indolyl d galactopyranoside the yeast cells that grew on the sd medium without histidine turned blue indicating that the other reporter gene lacz was also activated . notably all yeast cells grew well on sd medium lacking tryptophan . these results suggest that the full length _PROTEIN_ and the c terminal domain have transcription activation activity whereas the n terminal domain does not . to further characterize the function of the _PROTEIN_ gene under drought stress in vivo _PROTEIN_ and wild type plants were transferred from plates into saturated soil for phenotypic observation . upon transplantation the soil moisture was adequate and the mutant and wild type plants were not watered until the recovery experiment . in the days after being transplanted into the soil plants grew readily under normal water conditions . during this time no differences in morphological characteristics or flowering period were observed between mutant and wild type plants . as the soil in the plastic basin became increasingly dry soil osmotic stress began affecting the plants growth . from days the treated plants slowly began to wilt . by days mature leaf margins displayed a mild curling . after continued drought treatment for an additional days both mutant and wild type plants exhibited significant wilting . however there were no observed differences in phenotype . at this time watering was resumed and plants were scored for recovery from the drought stress . four hours and days after re watering photos were taken and . the majority of _PROTEIN_ mutant plants recovered after the resumption of watering but the recovery of wild type plants was reduced significantly after the drought treatment . specifically only of water stressed wild type plants recovered whereas of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ plants recovered . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ plants displayed a similar dehydration tolerance phenotype . the phenotype could not be detected in the _PROTEIN_ heterozygous mutants . these results strongly support the involvement of _PROTEIN_ in drought tolerance . we observed enhanced tolerance to drought stress in _PROTEIN_ mutant plants compared with wild type plants . the _PROTEIN_ gene is believed to encode a nac family protein that may function as transcriptional regulator . therefore we evaluated whether the _PROTEIN_ of stress responsive genes in _PROTEIN_ mutant plants was altered under drought condition . we chose to monitor the _PROTEIN_ patterns of several stress marker genes including _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in the wild type and _PROTEIN_ mutant plants . because the t dna insertion mutants _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ displayed similar phenotypes under drought stress conditions we used _PROTEIN_ for a detailed analysis of the stress responsive gene _PROTEIN_ . as shown in fig . the _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ gene transcripts were not detectable in wild type and _PROTEIN_ mutant plants under normal conditions . consistent with findings from previous studies drought treatment in the present study induced the _PROTEIN_ of stress gene markers such as _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in the wild type plants . marker genes were also induced in _PROTEIN_ mutant plants . however _PROTEIN_ mutant plants produced higher levels of mrna for the all selected stress gene markers at and h after drought treatment . therefore these results from marker genes analysis support the hypothesis that _PROTEIN_ may function in response to drought stress . to examine the _PROTEIN_ pattern of the _PROTEIN_ gene we generated and analyzed _PROTEIN_ promoter gus transgenic plants . the _PROTEIN_ promoter fragment was used to drive _PROTEIN_ of gus in plants . after transformation with the plasmid _PROTEIN_ into wild type arabidopsis numerous hygromycin resistant plants were obtained and independent transgenic lines were analyzed in the generation by histochemical detection of gus activity . the _PROTEIN_ profiles for all lines were similar . histochemical staining of seedlings revealed that _PROTEIN_ promoter gus was _PROTEIN_ virtually throughout the entire plant during seedling development as shown in fig . and . in day old seedlings strong gus staining was primarily localized in the mature zones of the roots hypocotyl and cotyledons . however no gus staining was detected at the root tip or in the elongating zone of the root . furthermore staining was absent from epidermal or cortical cells of the root . figure demonstrates the typical gus staining pattern found in rosette leaves of _PROTEIN_ promoter gus plants . in all plants analyzed and in most leaves of these plants gus staining was detected in or along the vascular tissue . gus activity was also strongly observed in the floral organs and cauline leaves . the apical stem of inflorescence was not stained . mature siliques typically displayed an additional more general staining near both ends . strong _PROTEIN_ was observed in stomatal guard cells of the mature leaf epidermis . vascular _METHOD_ were also intensely stained throughout the entire plant such as those present in roots leaves and a siliques _METHOD_ and several floral organs . from these data we concluded that the _PROTEIN_ gene is nearly ubiquitously _PROTEIN_ in various plant organs . in addition we further studied the _PROTEIN_ pattern of the _PROTEIN_ promoter gus under drought and aba treatment in transgenic arabidopsis plants . figure shows that both drought and aba treatment can enhance the _PROTEIN_ of gus reporter gene . this result is consistent with the inducible _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ mrna by drought and aba treatment . the bp promoter region of the _PROTEIN_ gene was evaluated for the presence of putative cis acting regulatory elements . a number of consensus cis acting elements were found in the _PROTEIN_ promoters consistent with the role of the gene in stress and disease responsive pathways . these include consensus sequences that mediate stress gene _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ sequences that mediate pathogen and wound induced gene _PROTEIN_ and sequences that mediate guard cell specific _PROTEIN_ .
