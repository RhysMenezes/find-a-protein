arginine methylation of histone and plays important roles in transcriptional regulation in eukaryotes such as yeasts fruitflies nematode _METHOD_ fish and mammals however less is known in plants . in the present paper we report the identification and characterization of two arabidopsis thaliana protein arginine n methyltransferases _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ which exhibit high homology with human . both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ methylated histone and myelin basic protein in vitro . site directed mutagenesis of the third arginine on the n terminus of histone to lysine completely abolished the methylation of histone . when fused to _METHOD_ _METHOD_ both methyltransferases localized to the cytoplasm as well as to the _LOCATION_ . consistent with their subcellular distribution _PROTEIN_ pull down assays revealed an interaction between the two methyltransferases suggesting that both proteins may act together in a functional unit . in addition we demonstrated that _PROTEIN_ an rna methyltransferase is a potential substrate for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and furthermore uncovered a direct interaction between the protein methyltransferase and the rna methyltransferase . taken together our findings implicate _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ as protein arginine n methyltransferases in arabidopsis and may be involved in diverse biological processes inside and outside the _LOCATION_ .
using blast searches with the amino acid sequence of the variant as a query we identified two proteins _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ with the closest sequence homology with human . these two proteins bear and sequence identity with human respectively and share identity with and similarity to each other . amino acid sequences of from arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ yeast drosophila and human were aligned for comparison . strong conservation was observed particularly within the characteristic sam dependent methyltransferase motifs i post i ii and iii as well as the double e loop and thw loop throughout the prmt family . major variations were presented in the n terminus which may reflect their unique substrate specificities . results from bioinformatics analysis prompted us to examine whether _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ contain intrinsic prmt activities . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ fusion proteins were _PROTEIN_ in e. coli and were affinity purified using glutathione sepharose beads . _PROTEIN_ was affinity purified as a negative control . the _PROTEIN_ bound _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ fusion proteins were then subjected to a methyltransferase assay in the presence of the methyl donor sam and the indicated substrates core histones from calf thymus oligonucleosomes purified from hela cells and myelin basic protein which was widely used as substrate in arginine methyltransferase assays . after enzymatic reactions the mixtures were separated by _PROTEIN_ and visualized by fluorography . histone and myelin basic protein were radioactively labelled by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ only but not by the _PROTEIN_ control . in addition histone was also methylated albeit to a lower extent compared with histone as reported previously . oligonucleosomes were not methylated in this assay indicating that other cofactors or a proper conformation may be necessary . next we sought to map which sites were subjected to methylation by _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . there are nine arginine residues in the n terminus of histone and is so far the only residue on histone reported to be methylated by . in this _PROTEIN_ two _METHOD_ of recombinant substrates were generated _PROTEIN_ fused to the n terminal peptide covering amino acids of histone _PROTEIN_ and its derivative bearing a mutation at the third arginine to lysine _PROTEIN_ respectively . recombinant _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were then incubated with _PROTEIN_ and the mutated form of _PROTEIN_ in the presence of sam . fluorography results showed that _PROTEIN_ was methylated by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ whereas _PROTEIN_ completely lost its ability to be methylated . this result indicated that is the only arginine residue in the n terminus of histone methylated by _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in vitro . to determine whether endogenous histone is methylated at total histones from arabidopsis were isolated and the methylation status of was analysed by western blotting using anti antibodies . the antibody recognized histone isolated from arabidopsis well but did not recognize recombinant histone _PROTEIN_ in e. coli which was free from any post translational modifications demonstrating the in vivo occurrence of methylation . as positive controls calf thymus histone and _PROTEIN_ methylated calf thymus histone were used and their levels of methylation were also captured by the anti antibody . the same _LOCATION_ was re probed with anti antibody to demonstrate equal levels of loading . the substrates of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ varied from _LOCATION_ proteins to cellular _LOCATION_ proteins indicating that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ may function in the both _LOCATION_ and cytoplasm . to test this _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ cdnas were fused in frame to the end of _METHOD_ under the control of the promoter and the distribution of these fusion proteins in plant cells was determined by a transient transfection system using onion epidermal cells with particle bombardment . as observed by confocal _METHOD_ microscopy _METHOD_ fusion proteins of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ displayed a strong _LOCATION_ localization although lacking the _LOCATION_ localization signal . as we had expected both proteins were also dispersed in the cytoplasm similarly to the pattern observed in onion cells _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ alone .this result was compatible with recent findings from suggesting that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ may be involved in multiple cellular processes . the similar biochemical properties and subcellular distribution between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ suggested that both proteins may be involved in similar physiological progresses . starting from this premise a _PROTEIN_ pull down experiment was performed using _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ as the bait to pull down mbp _PROTEIN_ . a direct interaction was demonstrated between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ as no other signal was detected by an anti mbp monoclonal antibody in any of the control lanes . it was reported that dimerization of was essential for sam binding and enzymatic activity and the dimers further formed an extended oligomer as validated by gel filtration chromatography . in this _PROTEIN_ our result suggested that hetero oligomers consisting of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ might be formed as the functional unit in regulating plant development . a previous study has revealed components of the ribonucleoprotein complex such as the human rna methyltransferase fib as the in vitro substrate of . in the genome of arabidopsis there are two genes that encode nearly identical proteins _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ which function as homologues with human fib . both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ share the conserved gar domain _PROTEIN_ and the helix domain in analogy to their human counterpart . to determine whether _PROTEIN_ was a substrate of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and its n terminal region containing the gar domain _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were cloned and _PROTEIN_ as _PROTEIN_ fusion proteins in e. coli . purified _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were incubated with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in the presence of sam as previously described . the reaction products were separated by _PROTEIN_ and visualized by fluorography . as shown in figure both _PROTEIN_ and its n terminal region _PROTEIN_ were methylated by _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in vitro indicating that _PROTEIN_ may be the potential substrate of . since _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ fusion protein is very sensitive to proteolysis during _PROTEIN_ and purification and is less competitive to acquire sam the level of methylation of full length _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is minimal the major methylated product _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ electrophorese as a broad band ranging from to kda as reported previously . other groups work has also demonstrated the _PROTEIN_ gar fusion protein or fusion protein containing the gar domain such as _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ are very susceptible to degradation . these fragments are much more competitive to acquire sam than full length _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ which ultimately results in the minimal level of methylation of full length _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . to determine the type of activity that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ catalyse _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was subjected to western blotting after a methyltransferase activity assay the samples were separated by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and transferred on to nitrocellulose _LOCATION_ and probed with an antibody specific for asymmetrically dimethylated arginine residues . the result demonstrated the presence of asymmetric dimethylation on _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ suggesting _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are type i arginine methyltransferases . since human fib was reported to associate with a subcomplex containing _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ tubulin and tubulin we determined to assess whether there existed a direct interaction between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . to this end _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ proteins were immobilized on glutathione sepharose beads as the bait and the mbp _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ as the prey in _PROTEIN_ pull down assays . as detected by western blotting using monoclonal antibodies against the mbp tag mbp _PROTEIN_ was shown to be captured by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ but not by the _PROTEIN_ control indicating that _PROTEIN_ interacted directly with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in vitro .
database searching was performed using tblastn at ncbi . multiple alignments of protein sequences were performed with clustalx and were manually edited with the genedoc program . full length coding sequences of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ the n terminal region of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ the n terminal region of histone and were amplified by pcr . primer pairs are listed as follows and for _PROTEIN_ and for _PROTEIN_ and for _PROTEIN_ and for _PROTEIN_ and for and and for . these pcr fragments were digested further and cloned in frame into the bamhi and ecori sites of pgex vector to generate the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ fusion constructs . to generate the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ constructs the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ fusion constructs were digested with ecori and the cohesive ends were filled in using klenow fragment then digested with bamhi . the resulting fragments of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were subcloned into the vector which was digested using the same strategy except for the last step using bglii digestion instead of bamhi . to generate an mbp tagged _PROTEIN_ fusion construct _PROTEIN_ fragments of _PROTEIN_ were digested with bamhi and ecori from the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ fusion construct and subcloned into pmal tev vector . to generate the mbp _PROTEIN_ fusion construct fragments of _PROTEIN_ were digested with smai and bamhi and reinserted into pmal tev vector . all of the constructs generated above were verified by dna sequencing . the fusion proteins _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and mbp _PROTEIN_ were _PROTEIN_ in escherichia coli strain cells and mbp _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ in e. coli strain cells and all were affinity purified with glutathione sepharose beads . in vitro histone methyltransferase assays were performed as described previously . labelled proteins were separated by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and visualized by autofluorography for h. approx . g of leaves from week old arabidopsis were homogenized in histone extraction buffer . after centrifugation at g for min the pellet was resuspended with m then centrifuged at g for min . then vol . of acetone were added to the supernatant and left at overnight to precipitated proteins . the proteins were then centrifuged at g for min and resuspended with m urea to a final volume of . all steps were carried out at unless specified . recombinant histone calf thymus histones calf thymus histones methylated by _PROTEIN_ and total histones isolated from arabidopsis were separated by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ transferred on to a pvdf _LOCATION_ and probed with anti antibodies . _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plasmids were transiently _PROTEIN_ in onion epidermal cells as described previously . the inner epidermal layers from fresh onions were placed on _METHOD_ basal medium . a amount of plasmids containing the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ or _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion constructs was precipitated on to gold particles and then bombarded on to the onion epidermal cells . the samples were incubated at for h in the dark after bombardment . _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was observed and captured using a confocal microscope . _PROTEIN_ bound _PROTEIN_ fusion proteins _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were incubated with e. coli extracts containing either mbp _PROTEIN_ or mbp _PROTEIN_ at for h with constant gentle mixing . the mixtures were centrifuged at g for min and the pellet was washed extensively with modified ripa buffer _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . after the final wash the pellet was resuspended in an equal volume of _PROTEIN_ loading buffer and separated by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . proteins were transferred on to a nitrocellulose _LOCATION_ and were immunodetected by monoclonal antibodies against mbp .
