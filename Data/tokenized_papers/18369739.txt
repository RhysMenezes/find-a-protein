the small heat shock proteins which are ubiquitous stress proteins proposed to act as chaperones are encoded by an unusually complex gene family in plants . plant shsps are classified into different subfamilies according to amino acid sequence similarity and localization to distinct subcellular compartments . in the whole arabidopsis thaliana genome genes were annotated to encode shsps of which belong to previously defined plant shsp families . in this paper we report studies of the five additional shsp genes in a. thaliana which can now be shown to represent evolutionarily distinct shsp subfamilies also found in other plant species . while two of these five shsps show _PROTEIN_ patterns typical of the other genes three have unusual tissue specific and developmental profiles and do not respond to heat induction . analysis of intracellular targeting indicates that one shsp represents a new class of _LOCATION_ targeted shsps while the others are _LOCATION_ some of which may cooperate with other shsps in formation of heat stress granules . three of the five new proteins were purified and tested for chaperone activity in vitro . altogether these studies complete our basic understanding of the shsp chaperone family in plants .
searching the genome database of a. thaliana by blastp and blastn with known plant shsp sequences as queries revealed orfs coding for putative shsp genes . this genomic search was complemented by est database searches including those for other plant species . sequence comparison and parsimony analyses of amino acid residues in the conserved _PROTEIN_ regions revealed that the corresponding proteins are grouped into distinct clusters formed on separate branches in a phylogenetic tree . based on this analysis and localization studies we defined five new subfamilies of shsps in addition to the previously known seven subfamilies ci cii ciii _LOCATION_ m p and po . in contrast to the ci cii and mi subfamilies which each consist of more than one member in a. thaliana each of the newly defined subfamilies is represented by only one gene in a. thaliana i.e. _PROTEIN_ civ _PROTEIN_ cv _PROTEIN_ cvi _PROTEIN_ cvii and mii . for all but _PROTEIN_ cvii homologous genes were identified in other plant species . it is interesting to note that genes homologous to _PROTEIN_ civ were exclusively found in dicotyledonous plants while homologues of _PROTEIN_ cvi were only found for monocotyledonous plants . except for genes in the civ family represented by _PROTEIN_ civ in a. thaliana the other four genes all contain one intron either in the _PROTEIN_ domain _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or in the n terminal arm _PROTEIN_ . altogether these sequence data define families of shsps in plants . shsps have a typical sheet structure within the _PROTEIN_ composed if eight strands as seen in the x ray structures of and ci . predicted secondary structures within the evolutionary conserved _PROTEIN_ of the plant orthologous shsps revealed that irrespective of the species most of the shsps contain all these typical strands . significant exceptions were found for members of the civ _PROTEIN_ and cv _PROTEIN_ subfamilies which lack amino acid residues involved in strand . due to the function of in strand exchange for dimer formation these shsps would be predicted to have a different overall quaternary structure . no reliable secondary structure predictions were possible for sequences outside of the _PROTEIN_ for any of these proteins . however with exception of subfamily cvi the c terminal ends of all other shsps contain conserved sequence motifs which are specific for each subfamily . to understand the potential functional complexity of these diverse new families of shsps gene _PROTEIN_ analysis by rt pcr and microarray profiling were used to determine what abiotic stresses and developmental conditions specifically affect their _PROTEIN_ . a. thaliana cell suspension cultures or whole plants were heat stressed as shown in fig . and messenger rna levels of the indicated genes were analyzed in different tissues by semiquantitative rt pcr . comparable to the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ ci and _PROTEIN_ cii shsps accumulation of transcripts for most of the newly identified shsp members was induced or strongly enhanced by hs treatment irrespective of the analyzed tissue . it is surprising to note that the _PROTEIN_ pattern of three members showed remarkable differences . for hsp cv high transcript levels were already detectable in leaves and flowers of nonstressed plants . however under hs the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ cv was induced in roots and significantly enhanced in leaves but strongly repressed in flowers . _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ cvi was constitutive and ubiquitously present in all tissues and transcript levels were not altered during hs . the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ cvii was also found to be constitutive but abundant transcript levels were only detectable in cultured cells and flowers . another interesting observation was the accumulation of nonspliced precursor transcripts under hs for some but not all intron containing shsp genes . hsps ciii cv and mii accumulated unspliced precursors while _PROTEIN_ cvi and _PROTEIN_ cvii did not . to obtain a broader overview of the _PROTEIN_ behavior of all of the shsp genes microarray data provided by the atgenexpress consortium were analyzed for a. thaliana plants and cell suspension cultures subjected to various abiotic stress conditions . with exception of the newly identified shsps _PROTEIN_ cv cvi and cvii all other shsps respond to different stressors to various extents but the strongest accumulation of transcripts was observed under hs conditions . however _PROTEIN_ the abundance and dynamic changes of transcript levels during ongoing stress treatments remarkable differences in the _PROTEIN_ behavior of individual shsp genes were obvious . this was even evident for individual members belonging to the same shsp family when compared over the time coarse of the applied stress treatments . the atgenexpress experimental series also includes information on the a. thaliana transcriptome of different organs and developmental stages . previous studies revealed that shsp family members are also _PROTEIN_ under control conditions at specific plant developmental stages and in defined tissues . in contrast to the majority of ci and cii shsps which show enhanced _PROTEIN_ levels in pollen and during _PROTEIN_ stages of seed maturation _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ civ mii and _PROTEIN_ po were only detectable in seeds but not in pollen . it is interesting to note that none of the other newly identified or any other of the organellar shsps shows a significant increase in transcript accumulation during these developmental stages . in agreement with our rt pcr data the _PROTEIN_ pattern of most members of the newly defined cytoplasmic/nuclear families is much broader and enhanced transcript levels of hsps civ cv and cvi are visible in diverse nonstressed vegetative tissues especially in rosette leaves . also remarkable is the _PROTEIN_ pattern of _PROTEIN_ cvii which is virtually restricted to _PROTEIN_ stages of shoot apex and early stages of flower development . after the classification of the newly identified a. thaliana shsps civ cv cvi cvii and mii on the basis of their phylogenetic relationship subcellular localization of these proteins was analyzed to verify this classification and to confirm the targeting predictions . _PROTEIN_ constructs encoding myc epitope tagged fusion proteins were constructed and the subcellular localization was studied in transiently transformed tobacco mesophyll protoplasts _PROTEIN_ the fusion proteins under the control of the constitutive camv promoter . the results shown in fig . illustrate that _PROTEIN_ civ _PROTEIN_ cv _PROTEIN_ cvi and _PROTEIN_ cvii were distributed in the cytoplasmic/nuclear compartment . both n and c terminal tagged versions were tested to minimize the possibility of mislocalization due to the position of the myc tag . however in all cases the intracellular distribution pattern was not altered by _PROTEIN_ of the alternatively tagged variants . as predicted the c terminally tagged mii was found exclusively in mitochondria which is shown by its colocalization with a cotransformed _METHOD_ variant targeted to the mitochondria . for comparison the intracellular distribution pattern of _PROTEIN_ po was similar but its colocalization with endogenous catalase confirmed the expected targeting of this shsp to _LOCATION_ . in contrast to mii myc the n terminal tagged version accumulated in the cytoplasm by forming large protein aggregates which is probably due to the masking of the n terminal mitochondrial tp . shsps of the cytoplasmic/nuclear subfamilies ci cii and ciii have been shown to be recruited to _PROTEIN_ under hs where they may fulfill protective functions toward denatured proteins . to analyze the localization of the newly identified shsps under hs conditions and to determine if they are incorporated into endogenous tobacco _PROTEIN_ hs was applied to transformed protoplasts to induce the _PROTEIN_ of endogenous shsps . the formation of _PROTEIN_ was followed by immunodetection of endogenous ci shsps which became clearly visible as a speckled pattern in the cytoplasm of heat stressed protoplasts . changing of the _LOCATION_ cytoplasmic distribution to the characteristic speckled pattern after hs and coimmunostaining with shsp ci specific antibodies indicated the recruitment of shsps civ cv and cvii into _PROTEIN_ . in contrast the intracellular localization of _PROTEIN_ cvi and of both organellar shsps mii and _PROTEIN_ po was not altered by hs treatment . it is well known that shsps can protect denatured proteins from irreversible aggregation by forming stable shsp substrate complexes . to test the possible chaperone activity of the newly identified shsps we prepared purified recombinant _PROTEIN_ civ _PROTEIN_ cvi and mii . unfortunately _PROTEIN_ cv and _PROTEIN_ cvii proved to be insoluble and could not be purified in sufficient quantity for analysis . we also purified recombinant _PROTEIN_ po as this peroxisomal localized protein had not previously been tested for chaperone activity . all four of these purified proteins were tested for their ability to protect firefly luciferase from heat insolubilization and to support luciferase refolding in reticulocyte lysate in comparison to purified _PROTEIN_ ci . the plant ci shsps are well characterized for their chaperone activity . as shown in fig . the activity of nonheated luciferase remained constant during the assay . after denaturation by heating at for min in the absence of any shsp the relative luciferase activity was reduced to less than and there was no measurable activity increase by subsequent incubation at room temperature . in contrast by addition of increasing amounts of recombinant _PROTEIN_ ci a concentration dependent increase in recovery of luciferase activity was observed . these observations are consistent with the model that shsps can stabilize luciferase during heat treatment by keeping the enzyme in a soluble state and thereby competent for refolding by _PROTEIN_ dependent chaperones provided by the rabbit reticulocyte lysate . although different amounts of the individual shsps were required to facilitate the same amount of luciferase refolding comparable results were obtained with purified recombinant _PROTEIN_ civ and _PROTEIN_ po . in contrast _PROTEIN_ cv did not show any protection capacity although even higher amounts of the shsp were tested .
