nucleotide sugar transporters are antiporters comprising a gene family that plays a fundamental role in the biosynthesis of complex cell wall polysaccharides and glycoproteins in plants . however due to the limited number of related mutants that have observable phenotypes the biological function of most nsts in cell wall biosynthesis and assembly have remained elusive . here we report the characterization of from arabidopsis heynh . which is homologous to multi specific udp sugar transporters from drosophila melanogaster humans and caenorhabditis elegans . we show that possesses the common structural characteristics conserved among nsts . using a green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ tagged version we demonstrate that is localized in the _LOCATION_ apparatus . we also show that is widely _PROTEIN_ especially in the roots and in specific floral organs . additionally the results of an in vitro nucleotide sugar transport assay carried out with a tobacco and a yeast _PROTEIN_ system suggest that is capable of transferring udp gal and udp glc but not a range of other udp and gdp sugars into the _LOCATION_ lumen . mutants lacking _PROTEIN_ of exhibited an early proliferation of _PROTEIN_ roots as well as distorted root hairs when cultivated at high sucrose concentrations . furthermore the distribution of homogalacturonan with a low degree of methyl esterification differed in _PROTEIN_ root tips of the mutant compared to wild type plants although additional analytical procedures revealed no further differences in the composition of the root cell walls . this evidence suggests that the transport of udp gal and udp glc into the _LOCATION_ under conditions of high root _METHOD_ production plays a role in _PROTEIN_ root and root hair development .
phylogenetic analysis of nsts from arabidopsis shows that the gene is a homolog of nsts that have multisubstrate specificity . alignment of the deduced protein sequence with sqv frc and reveals that the arabidopsis protein shares between and amino acid identity with these nsts . due to its putative function as a udp sugar transporter and its more distant relationship to the arabidopsis gdp mannose transporter _PROTEIN_ we designated the new gene because another group of putative udp sugar transporters _PROTEIN_ had been described previously . comparison of the cdna with the genomic sequence highlights the presence of seven exons . is amino acids in length and is a highly hydrophobic protein possessing predicted transmembrane domains . since individual computer _METHOD_ are not able to predict with precision the location of _LOCATION_ spanning regions we employed several _METHOD_ to build a consensus model for the topology of . given the close correlation of the number and position of hydrophobic domains of sqv frc and we consider that contains tmds . interestingly highly conserved lysine and threonine residues implicated in nst substrate binding specificity are present . taken together these characteristics are consistent with being an nst . in order to determine whether and to what extent is _PROTEIN_ we carried out quantitative rt pcr analysis using rna extracted from various plant organs . udp sugar transport activity may be required in many cell types and indeed is _PROTEIN_ differentially in arabidopsis organs with the greatest accumulation of transcripts in roots . the analysis of the root hair zone of day old plants also shows that transcripts are abundant . to analyze the distribution of _PROTEIN_ within these organs in greater detail we performed in situ hybridization analysis . the results show that _PROTEIN_ of is not uniform in the different cell types rather there is greater _PROTEIN_ of this gene in the vasculature of embryonic roots at the leaf abscission zone and in the receptacle and stigma of the flower . the broad pattern of _PROTEIN_ of is corroborated by data from microarray _PROTEIN_ analysis . these results demonstrate that is _PROTEIN_ in a tissue specific manner and is highest in roots . to determine the substrate specificity of we generated a myc his epitope tagged fusion version of the protein for transient _PROTEIN_ in tobacco . half leaves were infiltrated with myc his or with the empty vector . after subcellular fractionation myc his was detected in a microsomal fraction by an anti his antiserum but not in the same fraction isolated from the half leaves infiltrated with the empty vector control . the molecular _METHOD_ of the detected protein was lower than the predicted _METHOD_ of the epitope tagged version . we consider that the highly hydrophobic nature of is responsible for the aberrant phenomenon observed for other nsts including from plants . microsomal vesicles obtained from control and myc his infiltrated plants were used in assays to measure the uptake of a panel of radiolabeled ndp sugars . as shown in uptake of udp gal was approximately fourfold higher in vesicles isolated from tobacco _PROTEIN_ myc his than in the control . uptake of udp glc was also statistically significantly enhanced by _PROTEIN_ of the epitope tagged nst . experiments with udp xyl udp glca udp glcnac gdp man gdp fuc and gdp gal revealed no significant uptake of these nucleotide sugars by myc his . to further confirm the substrate specificity of the nst we transformed s. cerevisiae with myc his . _LOCATION_ enriched vesicle fractions were isolated from yeast transformed with the empty vector and yeast transformed with myc his . the presence of the arabidopsis nst with the same molecular _METHOD_ as that observed when _PROTEIN_ in the tobacco system was confirmed by western blot analysis using anti myc antisera . experiments with radiolabeled nucleotide sugars demonstrated that transport of udp gal and udp glc was two to three times greater in vesicles isolated from myc his _PROTEIN_ yeast than in the controls . in conclusion the assays performed in tobacco and yeast vesicles give strong evidence that is capable of transporting udp gal and udp glc . the experiments with myc his demonstrated that the fusion protein was associated with a microsomal fraction when _PROTEIN_ in tobacco leaves and was present in an enriched _LOCATION_ fraction when _PROTEIN_ in yeast . to determine the precise subcellular localization of the nst a fusion protein composed of the green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ fused to the c terminus of was constructed and transiently _PROTEIN_ in tobacco epidermal cells . four days after infiltration discrete motile spots of _METHOD_ were observed . _METHOD_ co localizes strongly with the _LOCATION_ marker mannosidase i but not with an _LOCATION_ marker signal peptide of plus the n terminus of the _METHOD_ and the _LOCATION_ retention at its c terminus . to further analyze the subcellular localization of the epidermal cells were pretreated with brefeldin a prior to visualization a drug known to alter the localization of proteins from the _LOCATION_ to the _LOCATION_ in leaves . treatment with this drug significantly altered the pattern of protein localization resulting in a mesh like pattern of _METHOD_ resembling the _LOCATION_ network . taken together the size motility and sensitivity to bfa strongly suggest that is a _LOCATION_ localized protein . subsequently a microsomal fraction was prepared from the tobacco plants _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ for use in uptake assays . similarly to the results obtained with myc his uptakes of udp gal and udp glc were sixfold and fold greater respectively in plants _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ compared to the controls . neither gdp man nor gdp fuc uptake was stimulated by the presence of _METHOD_ demonstrating that the fusion protein used for localization experiments was indeed functional . despite the characterization of numerous arabidopsis _LOCATION_ nsts to date no direct link between their function and role in vivo has been established . therefore we decided to examine the effect of abolishing _PROTEIN_ in planta . thus we identified and characterized two t dna insertion lines in the columbia ecotype the salk line and the gabi kat line . heterozygous plants from both lines segregated when grown on antibiotic containing plates indicative of a single t dna insertion . for each line we isolated a homozygous mutant . by pcr analysis we confirmed that in the line the third exon of the gene was disrupted whereas the insertion was present in the utr in the line . rt pcr analyses were used to amplify a fragment located of all the insertions to determine the mrna _PROTEIN_ levels in the mutants . we detected no _PROTEIN_ of in both lines indicating that these represent genuine null mutants . in conclusion the genetic and molecular analyses of each mutant line indicate the presence of a single t dna insertion in different exons of which abolishes the _PROTEIN_ of the nst . under controlled growth conditions in soil the growth and development of the aerial portion of the mutant lines were unaffected by the lack of _PROTEIN_ of . morphometric analyses confirmed that there were no significant differences between mutant lines and wild type plants in _METHOD_ of rosette weight time of bolting number of inflorescences height of _PROTEIN_ inflorescence number of _PROTEIN_ branches or number and spacing of siliques . even though is highly _PROTEIN_ in roots no differences in root morphology were observed in the or lines grown on _METHOD_ supplemented with suc . however as higher suc concentrations encourage root growth and among other processes increase cell wall production we explored the consequences of abolishing _PROTEIN_ under these conditions . studies of seedlings grown on _METHOD_ agar supplemented with suc showed a greater proliferation of _PROTEIN_ roots in the mutant lines compared to wild type plants after . however as the plants developed the number and morphology of _PROTEIN_ roots in the mutant lines approached that in wild type plants . sorbitol did not stimulate _PROTEIN_ root emergence indicating that the effect of sucrose was not due to an increase in osmotic pressure . _PROTEIN_ root primordia emergence occurred earlier than in the wild type although microscopic analysis after propidium iodide staining revealed no alterations in the development of emerging _PROTEIN_ roots nor in the number or size of the cells in the lrp of the mutants . we performed successive treatments with an auxin transport inhibitor and exogenous auxin in order to synchronize lrp emergence . however these treatments did not alter the premature development of _PROTEIN_ roots in the mutant lines indicating that this mutant phenotype is independent of altered auxin levels . the morphology of mutant root hairs grown on _METHOD_ agar supplemented with suc was altered . in wild type plants characteristic elongated root hairs with a vesicle rich cytoplasmic region at the root hair tip a reverse fountain type of cytoplasmic streaming and a basal central _LOCATION_ were observed . however in mutants grown under the same conditions shorter root hairs with bulging tips were frequently encountered as well as slightly wavy and branched root hairs with swollen bases . the altered morphology of the _PROTEIN_ roots and root hairs could be a result of a weakened cell wall caused by changes in its composition . to examine this possibility whole mounted _PROTEIN_ roots from plants grown for on _METHOD_ suc were immersion labeled in cell wall specific antibodies and examined by _METHOD_ microscopy . labeling with a monoclonal antibody specific for homogalacturonan with a low degree of methyl esterification was significantly altered in _PROTEIN_ root tips of the mutant . whereas in wild type plants abundant labeling was observed at the root apices there was a noticeable absence of _METHOD_ in the region closest to the root tip in the mutant line . nevertheless labeling with an antibody specific for homogalacturonan with a high degree of methyl esterification revealed no differences in the distribution of these epitopes between wild type and mutant plants . using the same panel of antibodies we observed no differences between imbibed seeds of wild type and plants or when seeds or _PROTEIN_ root tips were incubated with an antibody recognizing arabinogalactan proteins . to analyze the effect of the absence of in more detail cell wall material was prepared from week old seedlings grown on _METHOD_ suc and assessed in _METHOD_ of monosaccharide composition including uronic acid and cellulose content . no significant differences were observed in any of these parameters indicating that reducing the _PROTEIN_ of does not lead to any gross changes in wall polymer composition . taken together these results suggest that changes in the cell wall in _PROTEIN_ roots may be due to alterations in non _PROTEIN_ decoration and/or cell wall architecture . alternatively changes in polysaccharide composition may be specific to certain cell types present in low abundance that could not be detected with the bulk analysis of entire roots .

myc his plasmid as template to amplify a myc his tagged version of . as primers we used bamhi and myc his saci _PROTEIN_ containing a sac i site . the pcr product was cloned in pgemt excised using
