the recombinase is a member of the prokaryotic site specific serine recombinases which in the presence of a dna bending cofactor can catalyse dna deletions between two directly oriented bp six recombination sites . we have examined here whether the recombinase can be _PROTEIN_ in plants and whether it displays in planta its specific catalytic activity excising dna sequences that are flanked by six sites . in plant protoplasts the enzyme could be _PROTEIN_ as a _METHOD_ recombinase fusion which can localise to the cell _LOCATION_ . recombinase stably _PROTEIN_ in tobacco plants can catalyse deletion of a spacer region that is flanked by directly oriented six sites and has been placed between promoter and a gus reporter gene _PROTEIN_ . in transient transformation experiments recombinase mediated elimination of the spacer results in transcriptional induction of the gus gene . similarly recombinase in stably double transformed arabidopsis plants deletes specifically the spacer region of a reporter construct that has been incorporated into the genome . in the segregating generation plants were identified that contain exclusively the recombined reporter construct . in summary our results demonstrate that functional recombinase can be _PROTEIN_ in plants and that the enzyme is suitable to precisely eliminate undesired sequences from plant genomes . therefore the recombination system may become an attractive tool for plant genetic engineering .
to test whether the prokaryotic recombinase can be _PROTEIN_ in plants and to determine its subcellular localisation we have constructed a fusion of recombinase and the green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ that is placed under control of the camv promoter in the plasmid _METHOD_ . the plasmid was transiently transformed into tobacco by suspension cell protoplasts and transformed protoplasts were analysed by confocal laser scanning microscopy . we have used constructs that served as controls in this experiment _METHOD_ that is found in both cytoplasm and _LOCATION_ and _METHOD_ nls _PROTEIN_ nesmutated and _METHOD_ that localise to the _LOCATION_ . co localisation of the _LOCATION_ and green _METHOD_ is demonstrated by overlaying the _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ of the _PROTEIN_ type fusion protein and the transmission image of the same protoplast . the _METHOD_ recombinase fusion protein localises to both cytoplasm and _LOCATION_ . the fraction of the fusion protein localising to the _LOCATION_ varies somewhat in different protoplasts . to stably introduce the recombinase gene under control of the camv promoter into the tobacco genome plasmid was used for agrobacterium mediated transformation of tobacco seedlings . three independent lines that displayed resistance against kanamycin were examined by pcr for presence of the transgene . pcr reactions using genomic dna as template and a primer specific for the promoter in combination with a primer annealing in the gene encoding recombinase yielded a dna fragment of the expected size of bp in the three transgenic lines but not in wt tobacco . using rt pcr the _PROTEIN_ of the recombinase transcript was examined . cdnas of the three transgenic lines and wt tobacco were used as template in pcr with primers annealing within the recombinase coding sequence . pcr with the three transgenic lines resulted in the expected bp fragment whereas no amplification was observed using cdna of wt tobacco . the same tobacco lines were further analysed by immunoblotting using an antibody against the recombinase . the antibody reacted with purified recombinant recombinase and with a protein band of the same size _METHOD_ that was detected in protein extracts of the three transgenic tobacco lines but not of wt tobacco . in summary these results demonstrate that the recombinase can be _PROTEIN_ in tobacco and that the protein can localise to the cell _LOCATION_ . initial tests for the activity of recombinase in plants were performed by introducing transiently a recombination substrate plasmid into the tobacco plants _PROTEIN_ recombinase and for comparison into wt plants . we have tested for recombinase activity by using a substrate plasmid in which the promoter activity driving the _PROTEIN_ of the uida reporter gene _PROTEIN_ is blocked by insertion of a bp spacer region in between promoter and reporter gene . excision of the spacer region by recombinase mediated recombination between the two six sites should bring the gus coding region under transcriptional control of the promoter similarly as seen with other recombination _METHOD_ . as positive control for gus activity the plasmid was introduced into wt tobacco leaf cells by biolistic transformation . cells _PROTEIN_ gus appear as blue spots after histochemical staining for gus activity . introducing plasmid into wt tobacco cells demonstrates that the presence of a single six site between promoter and gus coding region does not block gus _PROTEIN_ . this is important to check since the resembles the situation after recombination which leaves one six site as a footprint . transforming plasmid into wt tobacco did not result in gus _PROTEIN_ indicating that the presence of the bp spacer region between promoter and gus coding sequence abolishes gus _PROTEIN_ . however when is transformed into the three tobacco lines _PROTEIN_ recombinase the gus gene is _PROTEIN_ indicating that recombinase mediated recombination between the two directly oriented six sites flanking the spacer region resulted in deletion of the spacer . this experiment demonstrated that recombinase can catalyse site specific recombination of a substrate that has been transiently introduced into tobacco cells . in the next step we have examined whether recombinase can catalyse site specific recombination of a target that has been incorporated into the plant genome . towards that goal the recombinase _PROTEIN_ construct which has been used in tobacco was transformed into arabidopsis by agrobacterium mediated transformation . transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ recombinase were identified as described above by rt pcr . constructs that could serve as recombinase substrate and as positive control for gus _PROTEIN_ were introduced into wt and recombinase _PROTEIN_ arabidopsis plants by agrobacterium mediated transformation . three of the _PROTEIN_ resistant transformants obtained by retransformation of recombinase _PROTEIN_ plants with the plasmid were tested by pcr for the presence of the gene encoding recombinase and for the recombination substrate . moreover by using primer pairs and it could be determined whether site specific recombination has occurred . in the three analysed double transformed plants in addition to the coding sequence both recombined and non recombined substrate could be detected . as expected in the control plants harbouring either the recombinase _PROTEIN_ construct or the substrate construct no recombination could be detected by pcr . to test for _PROTEIN_ of the gus gene and to reveal its spatial distribution three double transformed seedlings along with single transformed seedlings were histochemically stained for gus activity while the remaining double transformed seedlings were further propagated . plants transformed with the plasmid that served as positive control for the gus assay show a prominent staining virtually in the entire seedlings . consistent with the pcr analysis no gus staining was observed with the single transformants and plants harbouring both the recombinase _PROTEIN_ construct and the substrate display gus staining . to examine the inheritance and segregation of the transgenes progeny each of the three pcr analysed double transformants heterozygous for the transgene were further analysed . cotyledons of day old seedlings were stained for gus activity indicating that site specific recombination had occurred in seedlings resulting in _PROTEIN_ of the gus gene . we then tested the seedlings for the presence of the recombinase _PROTEIN_ cassette and of the substrate by pcr . specific primer pairs and limiting the extension times allowed discriminating the recombined and the non recombined substrate . we could identify wt plants and all possible combinations of presence/absence of the recombinase construct and the recombined/non recombined versions of the substrate except the combination of the recombinase construct and exclusively non recombined substrate . the segregation of recombinase construct recombined and non recombined substrate in the analysed seedlings has been summarised in table . the observed segregation pattern of the transgenes is consistent with the values expected for a single locus of each construct . this is seen with the three individual lines as well as for the combined segregation analysis . the result of the pcr analysis is consistent with the histochemical gus staining of the seedlings . all plants that contain exclusively recombined or both recombined and non recombined display intense gus staining whereas plants containing exclusively non recombined or no at all do not _PROTEIN_ the gus gene . due to the genetic segregation five plants contain exclusively the completely recombined but not the recombinase construct . these plants contain as recombination product only one bp six site between the promoter and the gus gene whereas the spacer region and the second six site have been deleted . this was confirmed by sequencing of the dna fragment amplified by pcr with primers and from the genomic dna of these plants revealing that the recombinase indeed has precisely eliminated the spacer and one six site . genomic dna isolated from these plants was also examined by southern blot analysis using a region of the gus reporter gene as hybridisation probe . digests of the genomic dna with ecori and ecori/hindiii resulted in three hybridising bands suggesting that there are up to three insertions of the recombination substrate . however the segregation analysis and the relative intensity of the two large hybridising bands relative to the band of kb comparing the single and double digest indicate that the two larger bands might be rather the result of an incomplete restriction enzyme digestion . in the ecori/hindiii digest the band of kb is consistent with the presence of the recombined substrate construct . in summary the experiments with the transgenic arabidopsis plants demonstrated that the recombinase can catalyse deletion of dna regions that have been stably introduced into the plant genome provided the target dna fragment is flanked by directly oriented six recombination sites .
the sequence encoding recombinase was amplified by pcr using primers aaggatccatggggctaaaattggttatgcat and _PROTEIN_ deepvent dna polymerase and the plasmid as template introducing terminal bamhi and hindiii recognition sites . using these sites the coding sequence was first cloned into bamhi/hindiii digested plasmid pbc sk giving pbc . then the coding sequence was cloned into the bamhi/sali digested binary plant transformation vector _PROTEIN_ giving where is under control of the camv promoter . for construction of a _METHOD_ recombinase fusion the sequence encoding recombinase was amplified as described above using primers _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . using the introduced terminal smai/bamhi recognition sites the pcr fragment was cleaved and introduced into smai/bamhi digested _METHOD_ as previously described giving _METHOD_ . to construct a recombination reporter plasmid for transient transformation assays the bp fragment obtained by hpai/ecorv digestion from the spacer region between the two six sites of the plasmid and inserted between the six sites of the ecorv digested plasmid giving . a fragment comprising two six sites spaced by bp was obtained by treating consecutively with kpni klenow enzyme and saci . this fragment was cloned in between the promoter and the coding sequence of the uida gene _PROTEIN_ of the plasmid treated consecutively with sali klenow enzyme and saci giving . from this plasmid one six site and the spacer region were deleted by digesting with saci/sali creating blunt ends using the klenow enzyme and religation of the plasmid giving . to construct a recombination reporter plasmid suitable for agrobacterium mediated plant transformation the bp bsphi fragment of pbc sk was inserted into that has been treated consecutively with sali klenow enzyme and smai giving . this plasmid was treated consecutively with kpni klenow enzyme and saci and inserted into cleaved partially with psti treated with klenow enzyme and saci giving . this plasmid was digested with hindiii/ecori and the entire cassette containing promoter the two six sites spaced by bp the gus coding sequence and the terminator was inserted into hindiii/ecori digested binary plant transformation vector _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ giving . as control a plasmid was constructed that contains a six site between promoter and gus reporter gene . a single six site was obtained by digesting with saci/bamhi and cloning this fragment into saci/bamhi digested giving six . from this plasmid the region comprising the promoter six site gus coding sequence and terminator was obtained by digestion with hindiii/ecori and introduced into giving . transient transformation of tobacco by cell protoplasts and the analysis by confocal laser scanning microscopy were performed as previously described . the plasmid was introduced into the agrobacterium tumefaciens strain by electroporation . day old tobacco seedlings were inoculated with the transformed agrobacteria as previously described to introduce the _PROTEIN_ cassette into the tobacco genome . after regeneration and selection for kanamycin resistance on solid _METHOD_ medium plants were propagated on soil at and h h darkness . for transient recombination assays biolistic transformation was used to introduce into cells of tobacco plants _PROTEIN_ recombinase . we have used a particle inflow gun that was assembled by the workshop of the institutes of biology ii/iii freiburg university germany following previously reported instructions . leaves of week old tobacco plants were bombarded as previously described using gold particles coated with the transformation plasmids . after bombardment the leaves were incubated for h at and assayed for _PROTEIN_ activity by histochemical staining using the substrate x _PROTEIN_ . after a h incubation at cells _PROTEIN_ the gus gene appear as blue spots . arabidopsis thaliana ecotype columbia plants were transformed with and by the floral dip method using a. tumefasciens strain in infiltration solution . transformants were selected on solid _METHOD_ medium while soil grown and transformants were selected by spraying the seedlings with a _PROTEIN_ solution when they had rosette leaves . for pcr analysis genomic dna from tobacco leaves and arabidopsis seedlings was isolated . reverse transcribed pcr was performed as previously described using random hexameric primers for reverse transcription . the following pcr primers were used for analysing the recombinase _PROTEIN_ construct _PROTEIN_ tcggtcgaacgtccacaattt _PROTEIN_ recombined _PROTEIN_ actgcctcttcgctgtac and non recombined ctggagtgaataccacgacga . immunoblot analysis of crude protein extracts of tobacco leaves was performed as previously described using an antiserum against purified recombinase and antibody binding was detected using the ecl chemiluminescence system . total genomic dna was isolated from arabidopsis seedlings and digested with restriction enzymes . of the digested dna was separated by electrophoresis in agarose gels transferred onto a hybond n _LOCATION_ by capillary blotting . hybridisation with a bp probe originating from the gus gene coding region was performed in a hybridisation buffer _PROTEIN_ at . after washing the _LOCATION_ hybridisation signals were detected using a typhoon phosphorimager .
