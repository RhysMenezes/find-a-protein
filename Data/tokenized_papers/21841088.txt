a classical approach protein separation by two dimensional blue native/sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was combined with tandem _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and up to date computer technology to characterize the mitochondrial protein complex proteome of arabidopsis in so far unrivaled depth . we further developed the novel gelmap software package to annotate and evaluate two dimensional blue native/sodium dodecyl sulfate gels . the software allows annotation of proteins according to functional and structural correlations assignment of comprehensive protein identification lists to individual gel spots and thereby selective display of protein complexes of low abundance . in total distinct proteins were identified by _METHOD_ _METHOD_ several of which form part of at least different mitochondrial protein complexes . to our knowledge numerous protein complexes were described for the first time _LOCATION_ . discovery of further protein complexes within our data set is open to everybody via the public gelmap portal at www.gelmap.de/arabidopsis_mito .
mitochondrial fractions of independent mitochondrial isolations from arabidopsis cell suspension cultures were separated by bn/sds _PROTEIN_ as described in materials and methods. the resulting gels were highly reproducible as revealed by gel comparisons using the delta software package . a typical gel was selected for further analyses . the most prominent spots were excised and analyzed by electrospray tandem _METHOD_ on average six different proteins were identified per spot . identifications were accepted if supported by _METHOD_ reliability scores and by at least two matching peptides per protein . however in some cases single peptide hits were accepted for identification if other lines of evidence were present . primary data of all _METHOD_ identifications are available in supplemental table and at www.gelmap.de/arabidopsis_mito . overall proteins were identified within the spots that represent unique proteins . for all spots values for apparent molecular _METHOD_ were determined based on a precise scaling of the bn/sds gel as given in figure . to assess the purity of mitochondrial fractions the subcellular localizations of all identified proteins were evaluated using the arabidopsis subcellular proteomic database _PROTEIN_ . this database summarizes all experimental and computer prediction data for subcellular localizations of proteins in arabidopsis . of the overall analyzed gel spots of the first hit identifications represent mitochondrial proteins according to experimental evidence given in the _PROTEIN_ ii database . evaluation of all unique proteins by the _PROTEIN_ ii database is more complicated . many proteins of this data set are of very low abundance and consequently have not been assigned to a subcellular localization by experimental data yet . overall experimental evidence for the subcellular localization of of the unique proteins has not been obtained according to _PROTEIN_ ii . a total of of the identified unique proteins represent known mitochondrial proteins and another are assigned to other cellular compartments like _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ or the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . however most of the unassigned proteins are localized in mitochondria according to targeting prediction computer _METHOD_ and therefore represent candidates for new constituents of this subcellular compartment . furthermore identifications of proteins assigned to other subcellular compartments in most cases are based on only a few peptides _METHOD_ which indicates that these proteins are of rather low abundance in our fraction . therefore evaluation of our _METHOD_ data set using _PROTEIN_ ii was repeated based on the identified peptides of all proteins . of the overall peptides peptides belong to known mitochondrial proteins . a comparatively low number of peptides are assigned to known nonmitochondrial proteins . another peptides are of unknown subcellular localization because experimental data are lacking so far . however most of the corresponding proteins are predicted to be localized in mitochondria . therefore the unassigned peptides/proteins represent candidates for newly identified mitochondrial proteins . based on the different evaluation results we finally concluded that our organellar fraction has a purity in the range of to . the novel gelmap annotation software package was used for online data presentation . gelmap was recently developed to functionally annotate isoelectric focusing/sds gels . the original software proved not to be suitable for the annotation of bn/sds gels because spots in general include several different proteins . therefore we upgraded the application range of gelmap for the assignment of lists of proteins to individual spots . since all proteins are annotated according to distinct functions and protein complexes the software now allows one to selectively display unknown protein complexes based on the vertical positioning of their subunits on a bn gel . for gelmap annotation the image file of the bn/sds gel was loaded into the delta software package for automated spot detection . a spot coordination file was generated by delta and exported into excel . this excel coord table was extended by several columns to add further details for all identified proteins like statistical values biological values _METHOD_ _METHOD_ protein accession number protein name assignment to a protein complex and to a physiological process and to a subcellular compartment . the image file and coord table were both loaded into gelmap at www.gelmap.de . the how to area of the gelmap web site provides all information necessary to prepare and upload a data set . based on the gelmap software package the content of the columns of the coord table is automatically displayed on the map in pop ups linked to the spots or in a menu to the right of the gel image which includes information concerning the assignment of the proteins to protein complexes or functional categories . by clicking on a spot names of all included proteins and their _METHOD_ reliability scores are listed in a pop up window and by clicking on a protein name further information is displayed including a more protein details link at the bottom which gives access to the coord table including all information available for the protein of interest . a more peptide details link leads to a second table indicating peptide specific information . in case a spot only includes a single protein the additional information pop up is displayed directly . features best can be followed if directly tested on the internet . proteins detected within the same spot are sorted according to their mascot scores . in general we interpret that high scores reflect high abundance of a protein . however this assumption is not always correct because the mascot scores also depend on the biochemical properties of proteins . the annotation of the arabidopsis mitochondrial proteome as generated by gelmap offers several advantages . first of all it allows easy access to protein identification data of large proteome data sets based on functional categorization . but more importantly it specifically allows searching for protein complexes of low abundance which are positioned at the same location on the gels as protein complexes of high abundance like the complexes of the oxidative phosphorylation system . the low abundance protein complexes in most cases have comparatively low _METHOD_ reliability scores which nevertheless are clearly above the threshold . using the categorization tools offered by gelmap their positioning along a vertical line becomes visible allowing one to deduce new protein protein interactions . the following protein complexes were found in the course of the project . subunits present within plant complex i recently were systematically characterized . currently different subunits are known seven of which occur in pairs of _METHOD_ . in the frame of our study subunits were detected in monomeric complex i . four subunits were not found . subunit was never identified in any proteomic study probably due to its extreme hydrophobicity . the plant specific subunit _GENE_ which was described by citation is present on our gel map but at a position far away from complex i . it could have been detached from complex i during solubilization or it may represent an _LOCATION_ identified complex i subunit . most of the identified subunits of complex i also were found in the kd i supercomplex . four additional proteins were discovered in our study which represent candidates for newly identified complex i subunits _GENE_ _GENE_ _GENE_ and _GENE_ . the first two subunits represent _METHOD_ and resemble proteins of the _PROTEIN_ preprotein translocase family . interestingly another complex i subunit the so called _PROTEIN_ protein exhibits similarity to the proteins of the _PROTEIN_ family . three of the four new subunits were found both in the kd supercomplex and in monomeric complex i supporting their assignment as complex i subunits . complex i subunits were additionally detected in spots not forming part of the vertical rows of spots representing the i supercomplex or monomeric complex i . all these subunits migrate on the second gel dimension at a lower molecular _METHOD_ than on the first gel dimension . at the same time their _METHOD_ reliability scores are low most likely indicating their comparatively low abundance . interestingly several of these complex i subunits form part of vertical rows of spots on the gel indicating the presence of complex i breakdown products or assembly intermediates in our mitochondrial fraction . for instance four complex i subunits of the _LOCATION_ arm of complex i were identified in vertical alignment close to the _PROTEIN_ synthase complex . also in most other cases the positions of complex i subunits separated from the holoenzyme nicely correlate with the positions of known complex i subcomplexes . this illustrates the suitability of the gelmap software tool to identify protein complexes of low abundance . based on our molecular _METHOD_ calibration complex v runs at kd on the native gel dimension . fourteen subunits have been reported for arabidopsis all of which are included in our map except for subunit c which is small and very hydrophobic . additionally a homolog of subunit g from other groups of eukaryotes was detected in the low native _METHOD_ range _METHOD_ . in yeast this subunit only is associated with _PROTEIN_ synthase within the dimeric _PROTEIN_ synthase supercomplex . under the conditions applied during our investigation _PROTEIN_ synthase dimers are not stabilized . since subunit g is completely detached from the _PROTEIN_ synthase monomer on our gel it probably also represents a dimer specific protein in arabidopsis . the more hydrophobic subunits of complex v especially subunits a and b were identified in several neighboring spots and therefore are difficult to precisely localize on our map . our interpretation of the assignment of these subunits to the spots on the gel is given in supplemental figure . on our gel the known and subcomplexes run at and kd . the relatively high abundances of these subcomplexes indicate that they represent breakdown products rather than assembly intermediates . includes subunits and and includes subunits a d oscp _PROTEIN_ and . the fad subunit does not form part of the two subcomplexes but was only detectable within the holocomplex or as a singular protein . subunits of complex v additionally were detected within several other spots not forming part of the vertical rows of spots representing the holocomplex or the and subcomplexes especially in the low native _METHOD_ range . these proteins may form part of smaller complex v subcomplexes or assembly intermediates . this central complex of the oxphos system has subunits in plants all of which are included in our map . for the first time to our knowledge the so called hinge subunit _PROTEIN_ was detected for arabidopsis . six of the subunits are present in pairs of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . all subunits also form part of the i supercomplex . no subcomplexes of complex iii were detected further supporting its extraordinary stability . on bn/sds gels complex iv usually is found in a larger and a smaller form . the smaller form lacks cox vib and possibly other subunits . on our bn/sds reference gel complex iv is present in the smaller form . its apparent molecular _METHOD_ was determined to be kd . for arabidopsis different subunits were described until now termed cox i cox ii cox iii cox vb cox vc cox via cox vib cox vic and cox to cox . the cox to subunits are plant specific . the map includes cox ii cox vc cox and cox . the cox i cox iii and cox vb subunits are visible on the gel but peptides could not be detected most likely due to the extreme hydrophobicity of these proteins . currently further efforts are being made to identify these subunits and include them in the online version of gelmap . the cox subunit was found in gel regions representing larger native _METHOD_ and therefore might only be included in the larger form of complex iv . some of the complex iv subunits occur in two or more _METHOD_ several of which were detected in the frame of our project . the holocomplex has a size of kd and consists of eight subunits termed _PROTEIN_ to _PROTEIN_ four of which are plant specific _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . all these proteins except _PROTEIN_ are included in our map _PROTEIN_ . some proteins occur in _METHOD_ . all subunits except _PROTEIN_ also are present in a smaller form of complex ii which runs at about kd . analyses by bn _PROTEIN_ revealed that complex ii gets dissected into two subcomplexes that comigrate at this position on the native gel dimension . the intermembrane space protein cytochrome c which translocates electrons from complex iii to complex iv occurs as a monomer of kd but also was detected in the native range of about kd . it is positioned on a vertical line together with the cytochrome c binding enzyme l galactono lactone dehydrogenase . we speculate that these two proteins form a protein complex of about kd . alternative nad h dehydrogenases are encoded by two gene families in arabidopsis termed nda and ndb . on our map we found the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ proteins . molecular _METHOD_ of the monomeric precursor proteins are in the range of to kd . all proteins were detected in the kd range of the native gel dimension . similar results were previously reported for _PROTEIN_ . we postulate that the nda and ndb proteins might form a protein complex that probably has a heterotrimeric structure . all enzymes of the tricarboxylic acid cycle are included in our map . due to horizontal and vertical smearing effects of the bn/sds gel most proteins were identified within several spots . however based on their mascot scores conclusions can be drawn concerning their _PROTEIN_ locations on the map . in accordance with reports in the literature three enzymes fumarase isocitrate dehydrogenase and malate dehydrogenase have a homotetrameric structure . citrate synthase most likely represents a homodimer . furthermore the subunit of the oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complex _METHOD_ a homodimer . in contrast aconitase can only be found as a monomer on the gel . succinyl coa synthetase consists of an subunit and a subunit but evidence for the interaction of these two subunits is not obvious in our map . finally as reported above succinate dehydrogenase is a heterooligomer composed of eight distinct subunits in plants . most tca cycle enzymes are present in multiple _METHOD_ . it currently can not be decided if the homooligomeric tca cycle protein complexes are composed of multiple copies of identical or distinct _METHOD_ . further biochemical analyses are necessary to validate and characterize the new protein complexes identified by this approach . pyruvate dehydrogenase probably is the largest protein complex of the mitochondrial _PROTEIN_ . it is composed of numerous copies of the and subunits and has an overall molecular _METHOD_ of about md . the holoenzyme was outside of the molecular _METHOD_ limit of our bn/sds gel . however subcomplexes were found . a tetramer composed of two and two subunits runs at about kd on the native gel dimension . furthermore much larger protein associations were detected that include the subunit . nad malic enzyme _METHOD_ a protein complex of about kd . it is composed of two distinct subunits of about kd each . the protein complex therefore probably has a hexameric structure . in the literature different oligomeric structures were reported for this enzyme complex that range from dimeric to octameric . the core of the tom complex consists of six distinct subunits _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . its native molecular _METHOD_ is kd on our gel slightly smaller than reported before . all subunits are included in our map except for the very small _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ proteins which migrate within the dye front of the second dimension gel . the preprotein receptor occurs in several _METHOD_ . one protein of unknown function comigrates with the tom complex on the gel . it has a size of kd and contains a tetratricopeptide motif like the preprotein receptor which was characterized for fungal and mammalian mitochondria . it currently can not be decided if this protein physically interacts with the tom complex in arabidopsis . metaxin another outer _LOCATION_ protein involved in protein translocation runs at kd on the native gel dimension . four distinct _PROTEIN_ complexes are known which are designated _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ complexes according to the protein components included . only two of these complexes clearly were identified on our map the _PROTEIN_ complex which has a hexameric structure _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is located in the mitochondrial intermembrane space and runs at about kd on the bn gel dimension and the _PROTEIN_ complex which runs at about kd and includes at least the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ subunits . another _PROTEIN_ complex which includes the _PROTEIN_ protein runs at about kd . _PROTEIN_ represents a nonessential subunit of the _PROTEIN_ complex . its binding partners were not identified in the course of our study . as already mentioned above two subunits resembling _PROTEIN_ proteins form part of complex i and the i supercomplex in plants . the adp/atp translocase runs at kd on the second gel dimension . on the native gel dimension it smears from kd to about kd . however highest mascot scores clearly are in the to kd range indicating dimeric to tetrameric structures . several _METHOD_ occur that may be combined or separated within the oligomers . the adp/atp translocase is known to have a large n terminal extension that is removed upon import but dispensable for protein targeting . possibly this precursor protein should be considered to represent a polyprotein that is cleaved into two separate polypeptides the smaller of which is of unknown function . similar to the results obtained for the adp/atp translocase other members of the mitochondrial metabolite carrier family were predominantly found in the to kd region . porin of the outer mitochondrial _LOCATION_ which is designated the voltage dependent anion channel of mitochondria runs at kd on the second gel dimension and is widely distributed on the native gel dimension between and kd . spots with highest mascot scores are at about and kd indicating that porins most likely form trimers that might associate to form hexamers . the _PROTEIN_ complex is composed of two heptameric _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ monomers . its native molecular _METHOD_ is close to kd . in the presence of _PROTEIN_ two heptameric _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ bind to the _PROTEIN_ complex . since bn/sds _PROTEIN_ was carried out in the absence of _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ heptamers are dissociated and form an extra protein complex of about kd . prohibitin _METHOD_ large _PROTEIN_ like protein complexes that are assumed to have functional importance as chaperones for the protein complexes of the oxidative phosphorylation system . the _PROTEIN_ form of this protein complex migrates between and kd on the native gel dimension . five different _METHOD_ were detected in our map . in plants the heterodimeric mitochondrial processing peptidase _METHOD_ part of complex iii . two further protease complexes were detected in our map the clp protease complex at kd which is composed of clp monomers and a putative homodimeric lon protease complex at kd . the glu dehydrogenase complex runs at kd and probably has a homotetrameric structure . an arginase complex runs at kd and probably is represented by a homotrimer . the kd isovaleryl coa dehydrogenase runs at kd and probably _METHOD_ a trimer or tetramer . the gly dehydrogenase complex is of high abundance in mitochondria isolated from green tissue but of low abundance in nongreen cell cultures . it consists of the t p l and h subunits . the p and l proteins are part of our map but do not form a protein complex . hence the complex _METHOD_ to be destabilized under the conditions applied . _PROTEIN_ proteins represent a large protein family that especially occurs in plant organelles . they are involved in rna maturation processes like rna splicing or editing . twenty seven _PROTEIN_ proteins were detected in our map several of which obviously form part of protein complexes because they run on the native gel dimension much higher than explainable by their monomeric molecular _METHOD_ . for instance _PROTEIN_ runs at kd _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ both run at kd _PROTEIN_ runs at kd and _PROTEIN_ runs at kd . further experimental evidence is necessary to determine the exact composition of these _PROTEIN_ protein complexes . it currently can not be decided whether these complexes have homooligomeric or heterooligomeric subunit composition . many further enzymes listed under other metabolic pathways similarly migrate at a much higher position on the native gel dimension than on the denaturing gel dimension indicating the presence of further protein complexes . it is beyond the scope of this publication to list all these discrepancies . however our database is publicly accessible via the gelmap platform at www.gelmap.de/arabidopsis_mito and can be queried for any protein accession of interest . the database also includes several proteins that so far could not be experimentally assigned to a subcellular compartment . these proteins represent candidates for new mitochondrial components but their subcellular localization should be evaluated by further studies . the presented reference map allows to our knowledge for the first time a systematic definition of the mitochondrial protein complex proteome . the protein complexes described in this study refer to arabidopsis mitochondria isolated from dark grown suspension culture cells . analyses of other tissues of this model plant as well as analyses of arabidopsis plants cultivated in varying conditions surely will reveal differing results . changes in the abundance of protein complexes will be analyzed in the future and the results will be implemented into the gelmap project . the identification of protein complexes by the combination of bn/sds _PROTEIN_ tandem _METHOD_ and gelmap provides comprehensive insights into the plant mitochondrial protein complex proteome . many protein complexes could be identified for the first time . biochemical studies will follow to validate the presence and composition of these protein complexes in the future .
mitochondria were isolated from arabidopsis cell suspension cultures as described by citation . organelle fractions were divided into aliquots of . for sample preparation prior to bn _PROTEIN_ freshly prepared organelles of one aliquot were sedimented by centrifugation for min at full speed and resuspended in of digitonin solubilization buffer . after incubation for min on ice insoluble material was discarded by another centrifugation step and the supernatant was supplemented with of _METHOD_ blue solution _METHOD_ . fractions were directly loaded onto a bn gel . bn gel electrophoresis was carried out as described before . basic parameters were as follows protean ii electrophoresis chamber gel dimensions of cm polyacrylamide concentration of the first dimension gradient gel to and second gel dimension tricine _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ system constant polyacrylamide concentration on the separation gel which was overlaid with a cm spacing gel as described by citation . gels were stained according to the _METHOD_ blue colloidal protocol . spots were cut out from a gel using a manual spot picker and were numbered consecutively from to . in gel digestion was carried out as described by citation . tryptic peptides were resolved in of liquid chromatography sample buffer and was injected into the lc _METHOD_ system . nano hplc electrospray ionization quadrupole time of flight _METHOD_ analyses were carried out with an easy nlc system coupled to a microtof q ii _METHOD_ device . for lc separation a two column setup with a reverse phase for hydrophobic interaction of peptides was used precolumn proxeon easy precolumn analytical column proxeon easy column . the lc gradient started with solution a and the proportion of solution b was continuously increased for min to b . this ratio was applied for min . solution b was then continuously increased again for min to b and a. _METHOD_ fragmentation was carried out automatically . for this the software selected up to three peptides of highest intensity in the _METHOD_ precursor scan . for data processing dataanalysis software from bruker daltonics was used . database search was carried out with proteinscape and the mascot search engine in the arabidopsis information resource database . the search was carried out with the following parameters enzyme trypsin/p with up to one missed cleavage allowed global modification _PROTEIN_ variable modifications acetyl oxidation precursor ion _METHOD_ tolerance ppm fragment ion _METHOD_ tolerance d peptide charge and instrument type electrospray ionization quadrupole time of flight . minimum peptide length was set to and protein and peptide assessments were carried out if the mascot score was greater than . proteins were further validated by comparison with the _PROTEIN_ ii database to determine the proportion of nonmitochondrial proteins in our sample . therefore accession numbers of all identified proteins were used for a search of the _PROTEIN_ ii database . available proteomic data _METHOD_ _METHOD_ given in _PROTEIN_ ii were used to assign each protein to its most likely subcellular localization . for four different data subsets the subcellular distribution as well as the proportion of mitochondrial and nonmitochondrial proteins were determined . gels were scanned using the image scanner iii and stored as jpeg files with minimal compression . image files were loaded into the delta software package . spot detection was carried out by automatic mode of the software package and corrected manually . a file including the coordinates of all spots was generated and exported into excel . finally gel image and coord files were exported into the gelmap software package available at www.gelmap.de . information on how to use gelmap is given in the how to area of the gelmap web site . for the analyses of bn gels detailed information for all identified proteins was directly added to the coord file . as a consequence the gelmap database for mitochondria of arabidopsis only is based on two files . furthermore an optional second table file was uploaded that provides peptide data of the _METHOD_ analyses . information about the identified peptides of a protein is available via a link for more peptide details in the pop up windows on the reference gel . the following materials are available in the online version of this article . supplemental figure . assignment of subunits of complex v _PROTEIN_ . supplemental figure . protein complex visualization by gelmap . supplemental table . detail table of the bn/sds reference map for arabidopsis mitochondrial proteins . supplemental table . subcellular localization of the identified proteins according to the _PROTEIN_ ii database . supplemental table . _PROTEIN_ ii search results . the arabidopsis mitochondrial protein complex proteome reference map was integrated into the arabidopsis proteomics meta portal mascp gator .
