deadenylation also called poly tail shortening is the first rate limiting step in the general cytoplasmic mrna degradation in eukaryotic cells . the _PROTEIN_ not complex containing the two key components _PROTEIN_ catabolite repressor _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ associated _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is a major player in deadenylation . _PROTEIN_ belongs to the rnase d group in the dedd superfamily and is a protein conserved through evolution from yeast to humans and plants . every higher plant including arabidopsis and rice contains a _PROTEIN_ multigene family . in this study we identified and cloned four genes from rice . four recombinant proteins and all exhibited exonuclease activity in vitro . point mutations in the catalytic residues of each analyzed recombinant proteins were shown to disrupt deadenylase activity . and mrna were found to be abundant in the leaves of mature plants . two types of mrna transcript were detected in an inverse _PROTEIN_ pattern in various tissues . was transient induced by drought cold abscisic acid and wounding treatments . mrna was not detected either under normal conditions or during most stress treatments but only accumulated during heat stress . four reporter fusion proteins were localized in both the cytoplasm and _LOCATION_ . in addition when green _METHOD_ protein fused with and respectively _METHOD_ spots were observed in the nucleolus . _METHOD_ fusion proteins were located in discrete cytoplasmic foci and fibers . we present evidences that colocalizes with _PROTEIN_ a processing body marker and _PROTEIN_ a microtubules maker indicating that is a component of the plant p body and associate with microtubules . our findings provide biochemical evidence that proteins may be involved in the deadenylation in rice . the unique _PROTEIN_ patterns of each were observed in various tissues when undergoing abiotic stress treatments implying that each _PROTEIN_ gene in rice plays a specific role in the development and stress response of a plant .
to identify rice _PROTEIN_ homologs we used the protein sequence _PROTEIN_ as a query for the basic local alignment search at phytozome . eighteen putative homologs were identified from rice genome database . however only four corresponding cdna or est _PROTEIN_ sequences of these putative could be obtained from ncbi and plantgdb database . these four homologs encoded by and were named and respectively . using the same way to search we identified _PROTEIN_ related sequences in maize . among them _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ cdna sequences were available in public databases . the amino acid sequence comparison analysis indicated that the rice and maize _PROTEIN_ homologues we identified are well conserved at rnase d domain with three conserved motifs and four important catalytic residues of nuclease activity dedd . in addition these _PROTEIN_ homologues contain the fifth conserved amino acid residue histidine . therefore all of the identified sequences from rice and maize were grouped in the _PROTEIN_ family . a phylogenetic relationship was constructed using amino acid sequences from rice maize arabidopsis human mouse fruit fly and budding and fission yeast _PROTEIN_ families . the phylogenetic tree showed that all of the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ proteins could be divided into three groups consistent with a previous report . the four rice _PROTEIN_ proteins analyzed in this study were clustered into two groups i and iii . were clustered in group iii whereas and its counterparts _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were clustered in the same clade group i . the amino acid sequences of the proteins in group iii were more similar to than to _PROTEIN_ proteins . to determine whether the proteins contained deadenylation activity the recombinant his proteins were _PROTEIN_ in e. coli . three recombinant his proteins and were obtained by histrap and gel filtration column . due to a protein aggregation problem of protein we performed ammonium sulfate precipitation followed by cation exchange and gel filtration to purify intact . the deadenylase activities of purified proteins were analyzed by incubating them with fam labeled rna substrates for various lengths of time . reaction mixtures were subjected to polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis the fam labeled fragments were then visualized using fluorometer . and proteins were able to remove the first seven adenine nucleotides of the substrates within min by stepwise shortening . compared with and the substrates were digested completely by within min whereas others required longer than min to completely digest the substrates . to determine whether the exhibited stepwise deadenylase activity as other proteins less amount of was examined . as result shown in fig . tenfold diluted proteins removed the first seven adenine nucleotides of the substrates by stepwise shortening . these results indicated that the direction of rna degradation was from to . the intermediate products accumulated in all of the reaction mixtures . the proteins removed the uridine nucleotide and the following three adenine nucleotides and produced shorter products fam/ucu . to confirm that the deadenylase activity came from the proteins a mutation strategy at the conserved active site residues was applied . four mutated proteins consequently did not exhibit deadenylase activity indicating that the deadenylase activity was not from contaminating nucleases during purification . these results indicated that proteins are active . to determine the _PROTEIN_ profile of the family in rice total rnas were isolated from various tissues and subjected to northern blot analysis . in the shoots of day old seedlings and the sheaths of month old mature plants and mrna were slightly detectable and were significantly _PROTEIN_ in the green leaves senescent leaves panicle axes and _PROTEIN_ of mature plants . two different transcripts of mrna and were detected as inverse _PROTEIN_ patterns in the various tissues . the mrna was detected in roots sheaths nodes and _PROTEIN_ whereas was detected in leaves and senescent leaves . northern blot analysis detected no mrna in any of the selected tissue . to examine whether the _PROTEIN_ of each gene responses to various abiotic stresses northern blot analysis and qrt pcr were used to determine the mrna levels of in the roots and shoots of week old rice seedlings subjected to abscisic acid drought cold salt and heat treatments . the accumulation of mrna was slightly induced by aba salt cold and heat both in roots and shoots . the level of mrna in roots and mrna in shoots was significantly induced by drought stress and cold stress . we further quantified the relative levels of mrna including both _METHOD_ in plants subjected to drought and cold stresses . consistent with the northern blot analysis mrna levels increased approximately more than fold in drought stressed shoots when the plants lost more than of their fresh weight in water . the level of mrna increased and fold after shifting to for h in roots and shoots respectively . it has been reported that arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mrna accumulated rapidly within min after aba and wounding treatments . since is closely related to _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ from phylogenic tree we determined whether the _PROTEIN_ of was in response to aba and wounding treatments . in seedlings the accumulation of mrna drastically increased within min after wounding and aba treatments but then declined h after treatments . these results indicated that transcripts were transiently induced by drought cold aba and wounding treatments . mrna was detected in shoots and was slightly repressed by heat stress aba and cold stress . moreover mrna was detectable under aba drought salt and heat stress in roots . among the different stress treatments mrna was only detected under heat stress and levels of mrna increased fold in roots and fold in shoots after shifting to for h and dramatically _PROTEIN_ to the basal level after h of recovery at room temperature . the differential _PROTEIN_ patterns of rice _PROTEIN_ family members indicate that each gene in rice may have a unique function in response to various abiotic stresses . the cellular localization of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ occurs predominantly in the cytoplasm and p body . another human _PROTEIN_ homolog _PROTEIN_ is located in the cytoplasm and _LOCATION_ . amino acid sequence analysis indicated that some proteins have various numbers of putative nls and nes . to determine the subcellular localizations of proteins genes were fused with _METHOD_ under the control of a promoter and introduced into onion epidermal cells using particle bombardment . to prevent artifacts resulting from high protein _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ emitted _METHOD_ signals were observed at h after bombardment . as shown in fig . _METHOD_ signals from _METHOD_ fused to the c terminal of each protein _METHOD_ were present not only in the _LOCATION_ but also in the cytoplasm the same cellular localization pattern as _METHOD_ only . in the cytoplasm and _METHOD_ protein signals were distributed uniformly whereas _METHOD_ was localized to specific _LOCATION_ foci and formed filamentous structures . similar subcellular localization patterns were observed when _METHOD_ fused to the n terminus of each _METHOD_ .we further examined the subcellular localization of proteins by fusing another reporter _PROTEIN_ in onion epidermal cells . each fusion proteins were distributed both in the _LOCATION_ and cytoplasm whereas gus was predominantly localized in the cytoplasm . the gus was also localized to specific _LOCATION_ foci and filamentous structures . in contrast to the well distributed signals of _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ in the _LOCATION_ the and _METHOD_ signals in the _LOCATION_ exhibited dense spots that were localized to the nucleoli . specific localization in the _LOCATION_ foci and filamentous structures of was observed . since _PROTEIN_ a human _PROTEIN_ homolog is known to localize in p bodies we determined whether was associated with p bodies and conducted colocalization experiments using the arabidopsis p body marker _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . consistent with arabidopsis protoplasts _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was localized in cytoplasmic foci resembling p bodies . mcherry _METHOD_ fusion proteins were colocalized with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ indicating that localized in p bodies . however certain mcherry proteins were not colocalized with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . by contrast _METHOD_ proteins assembled as filamentous structures in the cytoplasm are probably microfilaments or microtubules . we examined whether mcherry was associated with a microtubule marker _PROTEIN_ arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ domain one and two or a microfilament marker the second actin binding domain of arabidopsis fimbrin . the results shown in fig . indicated that mcherry and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were colocalized wherease _METHOD_ were not indicating that is associated with microtubules .
