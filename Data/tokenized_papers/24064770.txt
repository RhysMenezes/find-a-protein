brassinosteroid hormones are primarily perceived at the cell surface by the leucine rich repeat receptor like kinase brassinosteroid _PROTEIN_ . in arabidopsis thaliana _PROTEIN_ has two close homologs _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ respectively which are _PROTEIN_ in the vascular tissues and regulate shoot vascular development . here we identify novel components of the _PROTEIN_ receptor complex in planta by immunoprecipitation and _METHOD_ _METHOD_ analysis . whereas _PROTEIN_ associated _PROTEIN_ and several other known _PROTEIN_ interactors coimmunoprecipitated with _PROTEIN_ no evidence was found of a direct interaction between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . in addition we confirmed that _PROTEIN_ interacts with the _PROTEIN_ receptor by coimmunoprecipitation and _METHOD_ microscopy analysis . importantly genetic analysis of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ triple mutants revealed that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ signaling modulate root growth and development by contributing to the cellular activities of provascular and quiescent center cells . this provides functional relevance to the observed protein protein interactions of the _PROTEIN_ signalosome . overall our study demonstrates that cell specific br receptor complexes can be assembled to perform different cellular activities during plant root growth while highlighting that immunoprecipitation of leucine rich repeat receptor kinases in plants is a powerful approach for unveiling signaling _METHOD_ with cellular resolution in plant development .
in arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ is enriched in the vascular tissues whereas that of _PROTEIN_ appears in most plant cells . to reveal the localization of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ receptors the full length genomic sequences of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were fused to yellow _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ under the control of the native promoters consisting of a region kb upstream of the start codon for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . localization of these receptor fusions in stable homozygous plants was compared with that of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ plants a construct previously shown to complement _PROTEIN_ null mutants . root analysis of d old plants revealed the presence of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in all cell files of the root apical meristem similar to that reported . further up in the meristem confocal microscopy of a transverse section showed a predominant _PROTEIN_ localization at the outer cell files at the differentiation zone . in contrast with _PROTEIN_ the localization pattern for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ was specific to a few cell files . at the root apex _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are similarly localized at the _PROTEIN_ columella stem cells and a group of provascular cells including vascular initials cells located right above the _PROTEIN_ . transverse view at the differentiation zone of the root showed the presence of _PROTEIN_ at the phloem pole pericycle cells whereas _PROTEIN_ was absent from these cells . since the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ receptors under their native promoters was much lower than that of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ lines additional _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ overexpressing plants were established in order to increase the amount of _PROTEIN_ protein in the plant . the analysis of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ plants revealed a localization pattern similar to the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ native lines suggesting an additional spatial control at the protein level for _PROTEIN_ . at the elongation and differentiation zone of the root a stele specific localization was found in _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ plants . in mature plant organs _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were predominantly localized at leaf veins and associated with phloem tissues in the vascular bundles of the shoot inflorescence stem . while _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ plants showed a strong localization in the vascular tissues _METHOD_ was also present at the epidermis where _PROTEIN_ is predominantly localized . previously identified _PROTEIN_ interactors have been essential for understanding br signal transduction in the plant . here we use an alternative approach to identify a native _METHOD_ tagged plant receptor complex from young seedlings directly by ip using anti _METHOD_ antibodies immobilized on beads . in preliminary experiments wild type columbia seedlings were used as a control to detect proteins that bind nonspecifically to anti _METHOD_ beads . three independent biological replicates were performed for each tagged receptor and wild type complex purified in pairs . the resulting peptides were analyzed by _METHOD_ as previously described . first the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ line was used . in this line _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was undetectable in total protein extracts analyzed directly by immunoblot but successfully enriched after ip . peptide measurement by _METHOD_ of native _PROTEIN_ ips only yielded a few proteins besides the _PROTEIN_ bait including _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and clathrin binding protein _GENE_ . to increase the sensitivity of our approach _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ lines were subsequently used for ip . furthermore a revised procedure that employs protein cross linking microsomal _LOCATION_ isolation and complete solubilization after ultracentrifugation in addition to removal of putative _METHOD_ only coimmunoprecipitated proteins by comparison with a _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ control rather than the wild type was employed to minimize false positives . using this protocol and _METHOD_ analysis combined with stringent peptide and protein scoring parameters a total of _PROTEIN_ coimmunoprecipitated proteins were significantly enriched . previously described components of br signaling such as _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were found among the proteins identified in _PROTEIN_ ips . indeed the coreceptor _PROTEIN_ was also purified as a highly significant interactor of _PROTEIN_ . interestingly _PROTEIN_ itself was not detected among the proteins that coimmunoprecipitate with _PROTEIN_ using our experimental conditions . the vha and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ were enriched in _PROTEIN_ ips as well as the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . a number of other cytoplasmic kinases including _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ protein _PROTEIN_ were also detected . notably absent were the _PROTEIN_ phosphatase and the inhibitor protein _PROTEIN_ . taken together our results show that proteins that coimmunoprecipitate with _PROTEIN_ under our conditions include known components of the br signaling pathway but lack the _PROTEIN_ receptor _PROTEIN_ . to confirm the newly identified putative interactions with the _PROTEIN_ complex we transiently _PROTEIN_ selected cyan _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ tagged receptors in arabidopsis protoplasts and subjected these protoplasts to _METHOD_ resonance energy transfer combined with _METHOD_ lifetime imaging . positive colocalization of _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ was observed in protoplasts _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ fused to _METHOD_ . flim microscopy allowed the selection of certain _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ areas where _METHOD_ lifetime was imaged . the average lifetimes of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ of all double transfected protoplast combinations were measured and compared with the control _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protoplasts . significantly reduced _METHOD_ lifetimes were found between the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ receptor pairs confirming their in vivo interaction properties . a positive interaction was also detected for _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ homodimers but also between _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ receptors . overall these results confirm _PROTEIN_ as a _PROTEIN_ interactor in live protoplasts . to confirm the observed interactions in vivo coimmunoprecipitation was done in double tagged arabidopsis plants coexpressing _PROTEIN_ ha and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ constructs . _PROTEIN_ was successfully detected in an immunoprecipitated _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ sample demonstrating the interaction between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ proteins in planta . similar results were obtained for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . by contrast the _PROTEIN_ receptor was not detected in immunoprecipitates from _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ plants . nonetheless _PROTEIN_ heterodimerization was only detected by fret flim analysis . in conclusion our data show that _PROTEIN_ receptors interact with _PROTEIN_ in planta while a direct interaction of _PROTEIN_ could not be confirmed in vivo . _PROTEIN_ mediated signaling regulates normal cell cycle progression of root meristematic cells including the rarely divided _PROTEIN_ cells during root growth yet a role for brls in the root has not hitherto been reported . to address the biological relevance of the observed _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ interactions with _PROTEIN_ we performed a genetic analysis using multiple combinations of _PROTEIN_ like receptors and the _PROTEIN_ coreceptor . root length analysis of d old seedlings showed that _PROTEIN_ roots are significantly shorter than col wild type plants in agreement with previous reports whereas _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant roots were of similar length as wild type ones . strikingly _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ triple mutants enhanced the _PROTEIN_ short root phenotype supporting the notion that biochemical interaction between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ is required for br mediated root growth . by contrast the roots of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were of similar length as those of their respective _PROTEIN_ parents . br sensitivity of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutants was analyzed in a dose response curve . increasing bl concentrations significantly reduced the root length of wild type plants . at nm bl a reduction of root growth was observed in the wild type plants that was not observed in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . in response to nm bl the root length of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ was similar to that of the wild type whereas in the same conditions _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ showed a significantly reduced sensitivity to br mediated root shortening . a previous mutant analysis showed that brs are required to _PROTEIN_ quiescence at the root stem cell niche . since brl receptors localized to these cells we asked whether the _PROTEIN_ complex is necessary to preserve the competence of _PROTEIN_ cells to divide at the root apex . confocal microscopy and quantitative analysis of _PROTEIN_ cells in a wild type population showed that of the plants had one layer of _PROTEIN_ cells whereas had two layers . the remaining of the roots analyzed exhibited an intermediary phenotype where only some of the _PROTEIN_ cells appeared divided . this transition state was referred to as . analysis of _PROTEIN_ organization was studied in different mutant combinations . compared with wild type plants a reduction in the frequency of _PROTEIN_ division was observed in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutants showing of the plants with one layer of _PROTEIN_ cells . strikingly treatment with nm bl enhanced the observed insensibility to bl in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutants and _PROTEIN_ mutant compared with the wild type in the _PROTEIN_ cells . this phenotype was even stronger in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ triple mutants in agreement with our previous results in the bl dose response curve . similar to our results obtained for the bl dose response curve in roots this phenotype was dose specific and nm bl promoted _PROTEIN_ division in wild type plants whereas the _PROTEIN_ cells of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ plants retained some insensitivity to this hormone concentration . this insensitivity was stronger in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutants treated with nm bl and was confirmed when these plants were treated with nm bl . in agreement _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutants showed an increased number of plants with one _PROTEIN_ layer compared with the remaining genotypes for all bl concentrations analyzed . the complete quantitative analysis for three independent biological replicates is shown in supplemental supplemental table online . furthermore we observed that the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutants showed hypersensitivity to br in the stele when compared with _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutants . these results unveil a concerted action of these br receptors in the _PROTEIN_ and provascular cells and provide biological significance for the observed biochemical interactions . in conclusion our analysis shows that brls regulate br mediated responses of a specific cellular environment at the innermost located tissues of the plant .
transgenic _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ lines in the col wild type background were generated using the dna clone reported by citation . pro _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ constructs were cloned using a recombination gateway multisite cloning system . dna sequences were amplified from respective bac clones . the purified gene pcr product was placed into the gateway donor vector by the _PROTEIN_ reaction . the same procedure was done for the kb promoter pcr product of both receptors placed into the gateway vector . for the tagged _METHOD_ a donor vector was used . a recombination lr reaction was performed using the three sequenced pentry vectors in a three component pdest vector and transferred to plants by floral dipping . arabidopsis thaliana col ecotype plants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ fused to _METHOD_ were described previously _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . wild type col seedlings were used as a control . sterilized seeds were vernalized for h at and grown for either or d in agar or liquid murashige and skoog _METHOD_ medium containing g/l suc and mm /potassium hydroxide ph under normal conditions . six day old homozygous plants of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ grown on _METHOD_ agar were used for the confocal microscopy _PROTEIN_ analysis . ten day old homozygous seedlings _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were used for the ip experiments . the root length of d old seedlings grown vertically on half strength _METHOD_ agar without suc was measured and the data were analyzed with imagej software . all experiments were repeated at least three times . a student s t test was used to show statistical differences of root lengths among col _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutants . for bl dose response curve assays the average root length for each genotype was calculated by dividing the average root length for a certain bl concentration by the average root length of the preceding bl concentration . the se associated with each ratio was calculated with the corresponding formula for se divisions . the mean ratios between the three replicates were calculated and plotted as well as their corresponding se . a one way analysis of variance test was done to calculate the bl curve replicates significance . initial pull down experiments using _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ seedlings were performed using the protocols described by citation . coimmunoprecipitation experiments were done in the same conditions as the ips described above but instead of g of starting material g was used for homozygous lines coexpressing _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ ha . seedlings _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ in the col background were grown in shaking liquid culture . approximately mg of seeds per treatment were surface sterilized placed at for h and placed in a liter flask containing ml of gamborg 's b salts ph supplemented with suc . flasks were shaken at rpm at room temperature in constant light for d. in vivo protein cross linking was performed on g of whole arabidopsis seedlings as previously described followed by flash freezing in liquid nitrogen . total _LOCATION_ protein was isolated by grinding g of frozen arabidopsis tissue in ml of cold lysis buffer aminomethane hydrochloride ph mm nacl mm edta glycerol mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride mm naf nm microcystin and protease inhibitor cocktail tablets roche diagnostics . the extract was centrifuged at for min and the resultant supernatant was further centrifuged at for h to pellet the microsomal fraction . the microsomal pellet was resuspended in ml of resuspension buffer and sonicated using a probe sonicator . the sample was cleared of any residual insoluble material by centrifugation at for min and total solubilized _LOCATION_ protein in the supernatant was quantified using the bradford assay . total _LOCATION_ protein extracts were equalized to mg protein in ml of resuspension buffer containing triton x . fifty microliters of anti _METHOD_ magnetic beads was added to the protein extracts which were then rotated for h at . magnetic beads with attached proteins were immobilized on a magnetic separator . the beads were washed with ml of resuspension buffer of wash buffer _PROTEIN_ and of wash buffer . proteins were eluted from the beads with of elution buffer _PROTEIN_ . three independent biological replicates were prepared for the _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ control ips . while our protocol and controls eliminated many false positives we can not completely rule out that detergent insoluble _LOCATION_ components may still be present in our ip samples . therefore we refer to the proteins identified by _METHOD_ after ip as proteins coimmunoprecipitating with _PROTEIN_ rather than as _PROTEIN_ interacting proteins . after ip of eluted proteins was separated on a to nupage gradient gel . after staining to ensure equal protein loading each lane was segmented into bands and subjected to in gel tryptic digestion and peptides were extracted as previously described . peptides were analyzed by _METHOD_ with an easy nanolc coupled to an orbitrap elite _METHOD_ spectrometer . peptides were initially preconcentrated and desalted online using an acclaim trapping column . the nano liquid chromatography separation was performed using a cm reversed phase column comprised of a o.d . i.d . picofrit capillary that was slurry packed in house with a magic stationary phase . the mobile phase consisted of formic acid in water and formic acid in acetonitrile . after loading essentially the entire peptide sample from each band onto the reversed phase column the mobile phase was held at b for min and the peptides were then separated using a linear gradient from to b over min followed by min of isocratic separation at b at a flow rate of nl/min . the data were acquired using data dependent acquisition where the most intense precursor ions were selected from the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ scan _METHOD_ for collision induced dissociation fragmentation in the ion trap using a normalized collision energy setting . monoisotopic precursor selection was enabled and precursor ions with unassigned charge or a charge state of were excluded . fragmented precursor ion _METHOD_ were excluded from further selection for s. for internal _METHOD_ calibration the ion at

from sigma aldrich . all other materials were _PROTEIN_ from sigma aldrich unless otherwise noted . a workflow within proteome discoverer was used to process conduct a database search and determine peak areas for the identified peptides . the database searches were parsed to a mascot server _PROTEIN_ to search against the database using the following parameters a precursor ion tolerance of ppm a product ion _METHOD_ tolerance of d _PROTEIN_ of cys specified as a fixed modification and oxidation of met and phosphorylation of ser thr and tyr specified as variable modifications . the precursor ions area detector node within pd was used in the pd workflow to report peak areas for each mascot identified peptide . next individual _METHOD_ result files were loaded into scaffold for data visualization and cross sample comparison . implementing the peptide prophet and protein prophet _METHOD_ within scaffold statistical validation was performed to classify identifications as having at least two unique peptides with a protein identification probability of at least and a peptide identification probability of at least . individual protein quantification was accomplished using the total precursor intensity option within scaffold . fold changes _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ were also calculated and reported within scaffold . identified proteins were considered enriched in the _PROTEIN_ data set if the protein was identified in at least two out of three _PROTEIN_ replicates and when the average abundance of the protein in the _PROTEIN_ replicates was quantified to be at least fold greater than the average abundance in the _METHOD_ control replicates . to analyze the _METHOD_ localization in _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ lines d old roots were stained in mg/ml propidium iodide _PROTEIN_ and visualized after excitation by a kr/ar nm laser line . _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ were detected with a to nm and to nm band
