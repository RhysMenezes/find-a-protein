_PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ multiple roles in microtubule organization . previously it was shown that plant _PROTEIN_ binds kinase and colocalizes with microtubules in a cell cycle specific manner . to elucidate the function of _PROTEIN_ further this work analysed arabidopsis cells overexpressing _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . distinct arrays of bundled microtubules decorated with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were formed in the vicinity of the _LOCATION_ envelope and in the _LOCATION_ of overexpressing cells . the microtubular arrays showed reduced sensitivity to anti microtubular drugs . _PROTEIN_ mediated formation of _LOCATION_ microtubular arrays was not specific for the transition to mitosis and occurred independently of aurora kinase . the fibres were not observed in cells with detectable programmed cell death and in this respect they differed from _PROTEIN_ dependent microtubular assemblies functioning in mammalian apoptosis . colocalization and co purification data confirmed the interaction of importin with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . in cells with _LOCATION_ foci of overexpressed _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ strong _LOCATION_ signals for ran and importin diminished when microtubular arrays were assembled . this observation suggests that _PROTEIN_ mediated microtubule formation might be triggered by a ran cycle . collectively the data suggest that in the acentrosomal plant cell in conjunction with importin overexpressed _PROTEIN_ reinforces microtubule formation in the vicinity of chromatin and the _LOCATION_ envelope .
the _PROTEIN_ protein is composed of two domains _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ domain . arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ has two _LOCATION_ localization signals andm unlike other _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ has a signal for _LOCATION_ export . _PROTEIN_ also possesses two domains that can mediate its localization to microtubules . the _PROTEIN_ protein also contains a short region that shows significant probability for coiled coil formation as confirmed using several _METHOD_ coils paircoil multicoil and elm . the coiled coil region was found in plant proteins that contain _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ motifs across various plant species most of them belonged to as yet uncharacterized or hypothetical plant proteins . localization of _PROTEIN_ protein in arabidopsis cells overexpressing _PROTEIN_ . domains putative interaction sites and binding motifs in the amino acid sequence of arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ protein . for putative interaction sites binding motifs as well as domain graph elm and sumosp databases were used . schematic drawing was prepared in dog . domain organization of arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ protein and its plant homologues _PROTEIN_ targeting protein for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ brachypodium distachyon uncharacterized protein cucurbita maxima hypothetical protein oryza sativa hypothetical protein oryza sativa japonica group trichoplax adhaerens hypothetical protein _PROTEIN_ zea mays uncharacterized protein sorghum bicolour hypothetical protein vitis vinifera uncharacterized protein glycine max uncharacterized protein ricinus communis protein with unknown function . schematic drawing of proteins was prepared in mydomains . localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in dividing cell in cell culture with stable _PROTEIN_ and in root meristematic zone of a. thaliana . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was localized with mitotic microtubular arrays from prophase until early telophase . bar . localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in arabidopsis cell suspension culture overexpressing _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was predominantly localized with dots or seeds _PROTEIN_ elongated into bundled fibres around and inside the _LOCATION_ . frequency of overexpressing cells ranged between depending on the transformation event bar . relative _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in two representative samples of dividing arabidopsis suspension cultures overexpressing _PROTEIN_ showed a significant increase in transcript level compared to the control cells . deeper analysis of arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ amino acid sequence revealed the following the presence of an ligand ken box d box three cyclin recognition sites several _PROTEIN_ phosphopeptide ligands _LOCATION_ mitotic spindle checkpoint protein _PROTEIN_ binding motif mitogen activated protein kinase docking motifs sumoylation sites and several phosphorylation sites _PROTEIN_ . localization of proteins with these motifs or interaction sites is typically _LOCATION_ . plant _PROTEIN_ is localized in _LOCATION_ . in addition using nuc ploc and subnuclear compartments prediction system the subnuclear localization of arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ protein was predicted to be _LOCATION_ speckle and _LOCATION_ lamina respectively . cultured cells and seedlings of a. thaliana were transformed with plasmids containing full length c and n terminal _PROTEIN_ protein fusions with _METHOD_ under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus constitutive promoter . after selection stable cell lines were derived . both c and n terminal _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion proteins showed similar localizations . the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was observed in _LOCATION_ the perinuclear region and in a cell cycle specific manner with mitotic microtubular arrays . the localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein was similar for dividing cultured cells and cells of arabidopsis seedlings . the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signal was present with perinuclear microtubules in preprophase with kinetochore microtubular fibres in metaphase and anaphase and with early phragmoplast in cytokinesis . it was previously found that the cell cycle specific microtubular localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ requires aurora binding . _PROTEIN_ knockout in arabidopsis is lethal and only heterozygous plants could be obtained for the t dna inserts . therefore the current study was not able to test functionality of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein under the most stringent conditions by complementation of null mutants . however the localization data and interaction of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ with aurora kinase suggest that the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein is functional . as early as after transformation _PROTEIN_ fusion protein showed diffused distribution in cytoplasm with accumulation in _LOCATION_ a _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ signal was predominantly associated with dots and patches in _LOCATION_ and as fibrillar structures located inside the _LOCATION_ and in the perinuclear area . the effects of overproduction of _PROTEIN_ n and c terminal _METHOD_ fusion proteins were similar suggesting that the _METHOD_ moiety did not interfere with the function of _PROTEIN_ in fibre formation . overexpression of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was confirmed by real time qpcr . microscopic analysis of _PROTEIN_ overexpressing cells showed that the dots of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in interphase _LOCATION_ were formed within a period of d from transformation . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ dots and patches were gradually built into _PROTEIN_ fibrillar structures . the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signal was attached to filamentous structures reminiscent of microtubules that were arranged into cage like structures surrounding the _LOCATION_ . to prove whether _PROTEIN_ decorated fibres in _PROTEIN_ overexpressing cells represent cytoskeletal polymers this study performed a series of double _METHOD_ experiments . fibres were positive for tubulin but they were not recognized by anti actin antibody . the signal for tubulin localized with the _PROTEIN_ foci in _LOCATION_ and with forming fibres . in _PROTEIN_ overexpressing cells containing more prominent fibrillar arrays tubulin was associated with thinner _PROTEIN_ positive fibres along their entire length . _PROTEIN_ bundles heavily labelled with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ showed a weaker signal for tubulin probably due to the lower accessibility of the epitope to the anti tubulin antibody . _PROTEIN_ localization with ectopic perinuclear and _LOCATION_ microtubules in arabidopsis cells overexpressing _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ foci localized with tubulin in the _LOCATION_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ partially loaded on tubulin fibres in cells with foci of overexpressed _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . serial sections of the cell immunostained by anti _METHOD_ antibody and anti tubulin antibody with chromatin stained by dapi are shown . tubulin signal with thinner _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ decorated fibres was stronger compared to the signal with _PROTEIN_ bundles of analysed cells showed the corresponding pattern . while microtubules were depolymerized with exception of kinetochore stubs in cells _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ gpf after the treatment with apm for microtubular arrays in cell overexpressing _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ were stable after the same treatment . bars . treatment of cells overexpressing _PROTEIN_ with the microtubule depolymerizing drug apm showed that the _LOCATION_ and perinuclear microtubular bundles were resistant to drug induced depolymerization . as shown in the microtubular arrays persisted in of apm treated cells showing overexpression of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . microtubules were largely depolymerized by the same dose of apm in cells with stable _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and only remnants of kinetochore microtubules decorated with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were observed . taxol treatment did not result in further bundling or stabilization of ectopic microtubules in _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ overexpressing cells . serial sections of _LOCATION_ and d reconstructions showed a network of microtubules decorated with _PROTEIN_ inside the _LOCATION_ and in the area adjacent to the _LOCATION_ . _PROTEIN_ intertwined bundles of microtubules were present around the _LOCATION_ and anchored to the _LOCATION_ at the cell periphery . more detailed analyses using imaris sectioning of _LOCATION_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ overexpressing cells confirmed the formation of fibrillar structures inside the _LOCATION_ in the vicinity of chromatin and also inside the nucleoli . to prove _LOCATION_ location of ectopic arrays cells overexpressing _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in vivo were analysed . as shown in fibres decorated with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were observed together with intranuclear foci of overexpressed _PROTEIN_ . three dimensional reconstruction and analysis of microtubular arrays in arabidopsis cells overexpressing _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . representative images from reconstruction of cells with _PROTEIN_ decorated fibres around and inside _LOCATION_ microtubular fibres in the perinuclear area are twisted the microtubular fibres anchored _LOCATION_ to cell periphery bar . two imaris sections of the _LOCATION_ with _PROTEIN_ decorated fibres _PROTEIN_ decorated fibres were present inside the _LOCATION_ and the nucleolus overexpressing _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ panel z shows a single z stack of the _LOCATION_ right panel y z shows cross section by y plane perpendicular to z plane in the _PROTEIN_ panel lower panel x z shows cross section by x plane perpendicular to z plane in the _PROTEIN_ panel bar . serial z stacks of _LOCATION_ of cell overexpressing _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ analysed in vivo . sections from _LOCATION_ surface to the centre showed perinuclear fibres and intranuclear foci and fibres decorated by _PROTEIN_ bar . these data showed that overexpressed _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein was initially present in _LOCATION_ foci and patches and _PROTEIN_ fibrillar microtubular arrays were formed in _LOCATION_ and the perinuclear area . the ectopic microtubular fibres heavily decorated with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were resistant to microtubular drugs . importin binds _PROTEIN_ protein and imports it into the _LOCATION_ and rangtpase sequesters the _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ pool before breakdown of the _LOCATION_ envelope . binding of animal importin to recombinantly _PROTEIN_ plant _PROTEIN_ protein in a rangtpase dependent manner was shown in vitro by et al . . to determine whether the rangtpase pathway is involved in the process of _PROTEIN_ mediated formation of microtubular arrays the current work analysed the immunolocalization of importin and ran in _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ overproducing cells . the signal for importin was observed in _LOCATION_ associated with the _LOCATION_ envelope and with intranuclear and perinuclear microtubular fibres . quantitative co localization analyses of _PROTEIN_ and importin were performed using the imagej plugin jacop . the analyses showed high degrees of co localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ with patchy patterns of importin on perinuclear fibres and with microtubular fibres extending from the perinuclear area to the periphery . all coefficients correctly reported a strong overlap between the two channels . immunolocalization of importin and ran in _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ overproducing cells . _PROTEIN_ and importin colocalized in the vicinity of the _LOCATION_ with the _PROTEIN_ decorated microtubular fibres and in intranuclear foci . colocalization was analysed by imagej software with jacop plugin . the similar labelling pattern was observed in of analysed overexpressing cells . importin was copurified with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ by _METHOD_ trap _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ from extracts of arabidopsis cells . _METHOD_ immunoprecipitate from wild type ler arabidopsis culture was used as a negative control _METHOD_ . immunoblotting of _METHOD_ immunoprecipitate from _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ cell culture with anti _METHOD_ antibody showed several bands corresponding to the full length molecule of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ above and several degradation products . representative images of _METHOD_ labelling of the cells overexpressing _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ immunostained with anti importin with anti ran chromatin stained by dapi . importin signal was _LOCATION_ localized around _LOCATION_ and colocalized with some of the _PROTEIN_ foci in overexpressing cells with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ foci and patches . _LOCATION_ signal for importin was reduced in cells where _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fibres were formed and it localized with the fibres around _LOCATION_ and in the _LOCATION_ . signal for ran in the _LOCATION_ of cells with _PROTEIN_ perinuclear fibres was not above the level of signal found in untransformed cells . importin _LOCATION_ signal declined in the cells with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fibres while a portion of signal for importin localized with _PROTEIN_ perinuclear fibres . bars . previous experiments used _METHOD_ co immunoprecipitation to show an interaction of _METHOD_ with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . the current work performed _METHOD_ co immunoprecipitation to provide evidence for an interaction between _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and importin . as shown in importin was co purified with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ from low speed supernatants . negative controls as well as probing of purified _PROTEIN_ complexes with the relevant anti actin antibody confirmed that interaction of importin with _PROTEIN_ was specific . it is known that _PROTEIN_ protein is highly unstable in plant cell extracts or under conditions of electrophoretic protein separation and this makes detection by western blotting difficult . in agreement with data shown by et al . and et al . several bands for the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein and its degradation products were detected with anti _METHOD_ antibody in a sample of immunopurified _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . next ran protein was immunolocalized in _PROTEIN_ overexpressing cells . the signal for ran was stronger in _LOCATION_ with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _LOCATION_ dots and patches where of _LOCATION_ showed higher levels of the ran signal compared to the untransformed controls . on the other hand only of _LOCATION_ showed any signal above that of control untransformed _LOCATION_ in cells with _LOCATION_ microtubular arrays . this finding suggests that the ran _LOCATION_ signal was weakening during microtubular array assembly . multiple labelling showed that similarly to ran the importin signal was enriched in _LOCATION_ of overexpressing cells where it co localized with some of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ foci and accumulated around ne . in cells with assembled fibres diminution of the _LOCATION_ signal for importin was even more pronounced compared to that observed for ran . a smaller proportion of the importin signal was observed associated with the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ decorated microtubular arrays . plant tubulin is associated with microtubular arrays around the _LOCATION_ envelope and in _LOCATION_ . et al . showed that tubulin is localized with _PROTEIN_ and on mitotic microtubular arrays . therefore this work analysed the localization of tubulin in cells overexpressing _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . signals for tubulin were observed in a patchy pattern with microtubular bundles formed in the vicinity of the _LOCATION_ and extending to the cell periphery . quantitative co localization analyses of tubulin and _PROTEIN_ using the imagej plugin jacop showed co localization of tubulin with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ decorated microtubular arrays . however the association of tubulin with immunopurified _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ could not be demonstrated . colocalization of _PROTEIN_ and tubulin in arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ overproducing cells . tubulin localized together with attpx _METHOD_ . analysis of cells overexpressing _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ stained with anti tubulin antibody dapi obtained by laser scanning microscopy and reconstructed . still images from reconstruction animation show tubulin localized with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ decorated fibres in vicinity of _LOCATION_ envelope with intranuclear microtubules and in patchy pattern on microtubular bundles extending from perinuclear area . tubulin colocalized with _PROTEIN_ on microtubular fibres extending from perinuclear area to the cytoplasm and _LOCATION_ and on the _LOCATION_ envelope . colocalization was analysed by imagej software with jacop plugin . the similar labelling pattern was observed in of analysed overexpressing cells . bars . together the immunolocalization and immunopurification data suggest a function for importin with plant _PROTEIN_ . the accumulation of importin and ran in the _LOCATION_ of overexpressing cells indicates a _LOCATION_ import of overexpressed _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . diminution of the _LOCATION_ signal for importin as observed in cells with microtubular arrays indicates that microtubule formation was triggered by sequestered _PROTEIN_ possibly ran cycle dependent . the presence of an importin signal with _PROTEIN_ on ectopic microtubular fibres suggests that an excess of the overexpressed _PROTEIN_ may still be bound to importin . previous data showed that binds to _PROTEIN_ and that binding is required for cell cycle specific localization of _PROTEIN_ on mitotic microtubular arrays . in cells with stable _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ both proteins colocalized with microtubular arrays from preprophase to early telophase and were co purified . however only a weak signal was found on bundled _PROTEIN_ decorated microtubules in overexpressing cells . to determine whether binding of aurora kinase was required for _PROTEIN_ mediated formation of ectopic microtubular arrays this work overexpressed a truncated version of _PROTEIN_ that lacked two conserved aurora kinase binding sites _PROTEIN_ . microtubular arrays were formed in the vicinity of and in the _LOCATION_ and were associated with _PROTEIN_ . this work analysed the effect of the aurora kinase inhibitor that affected microtubular mitotic arrays in wild type arabidopsis cells . contrary to the wild type cells treatment had no visible effect on the formation stability and arrangement of _LOCATION_ and perinuclear microtubular bundles in cells overexpressing _PROTEIN_ . these data suggest that binding of aurora kinase with _PROTEIN_ which is required for localization of _PROTEIN_ on mitotic microtubules is dispensable for the formation and organization of the ectopic peri/intranuclear microtubules in _PROTEIN_ overexpressing cells . localization of _PROTEIN_ and in control and treated cells overproducing _PROTEIN_ . localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ from the prophase until the early telophase in arabidopsis cells . weak signal of with _PROTEIN_ in the _LOCATION_ of arabidopsis . _PROTEIN_ fibres in _PROTEIN_ overproducing cells were resistant to aurora kinase inhibitor . bars . to understand whether the formation of ectopic microtubules was cell cycle specific anti phosphohistone antibody was used to monitor the mitotic status of the chromatin from pre prophase to metaphase . cells with _PROTEIN_ decorated fibres did not show phosphohistone staining . further proof that fibres were not formed in preparation for mitosis was provided by dapi staining that showed diffuse interphase chromatin but not pre mitotic condensed chromatin in cells with the _PROTEIN_ decorated microtubular arrays . the formation and arrangement of ectopic microtubular bundles was not affected by treatment with the mitotic kinase inhibitor roscovitine which previously showed a severe effect on microtubular arrays . these findings suggest that ectopic _LOCATION_ and perinuclear microtubules were not formed specifically during the transition from interphase to mitosis . formation of _PROTEIN_ fibrillar structures was not dependent on mitotic status of the chromatin or connected with programmed cell death . immunolabelling of _PROTEIN_ and phosphohistone in prophase and interphase cells overexpressing _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ decorated ectopic microtubules were not formed in _LOCATION_ with mitotic chromatin . ectopic _PROTEIN_ decorated microtubular arrays were not observed in cells entering programmed cell death that were positive with tunel labelling . bars . a type of _PROTEIN_ stabilized microtubular array similar to that observed in these experiments is formed in mammalian cells where it functions during apoptosis . the current examined whether the _PROTEIN_ induced microtubules were involved in apoptosis in arabidopsis . in situ detection of dsdna breaks was used . the proportion of cells with tunel stained _LOCATION_ was in both wild type and _PROTEIN_ overexpressing cells . neither _PROTEIN_ dots nor ectopic perinuclear or _LOCATION_ microtubules were observed in cells with tunel detectable dsdna breaks . to provide further evidence of programmed cell death cell viability was analysed using evans blue staining which does not discriminate between apoptosis and necrosis however changes in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ recognized by evans blue might be an early indicator of cells undergoing dna fragmentation prior to tunel detectable dna breakage . overexpressing cells with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ labelled fibres were not stained with evans blue . the formation of _PROTEIN_ decorated ectopic microtubules was therefore not associated with programmed cell death .
molecular cloning of _PROTEIN_ and for n and c terminal fusions was performed according to et al . . gateway binary vectors for n terminal _METHOD_ fusion for n terminal _METHOD_ fusion for c terminal

in controls or overexpressed _PROTEIN_ cells was designated as . the primers used for real time pcr were _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ aagctcgacctgtgaacaaga and _PROTEIN_ ctggcagatgtggtgtacttct . to ensure specificity of primers primer pairs were designed to span across two neighbouring exons and were detected as a single peak in dissociation curve analysis . amiprophos methyl at a concentration of was used for microtubule depolymerization as described et al . taxol was used at a concentration . inhibition of cdk and aurora kinase activity was done adding roscovitine as described by et al . and et al . and aurora kinase inhibitor as described by et al . . co immunoprecipitations were performed using _METHOD_ trap a and _METHOD_ trap a according to the manufacturer s instructions using the modified protocol described in et al . . the extract from the a. thaliana cell culture _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or co _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ after centrifugation at g for were used directly or solubilized by np for at . the extracts were supplemented with double concentration of inhibitors of proteases with inhibitors of phosphatases and and incubated with _METHOD_ trap or _METHOD_ trap beads for at . as a negative control _METHOD_ immunoprecipitate from wild type ler arabidopsis culture was used . the immunoprecipitated proteins were released by elution with glycine . proteins in the eluates were resolved by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and analysed for importin tubulin and by immunoblotting with rabbit polyclonal anti importin antibody affinity purified rabbit polyclonal antibody athtu anti actin anti _METHOD_ and anti _METHOD_ antibodies and anti ran antibody . secondary antibodies anti rabbit and
