proteomic approaches on lipid bodies have led to the identification of proteins associated with this compartment showing that rather than the inert fat depot lipid droplets appear as complex dynamic organelles with roles in metabolism control and cell signaling . we focused our investigations on caleosin _PROTEIN_ a minor protein of the arabidopsis thaliana seed lipid body . _PROTEIN_ shares an original triblock structure which confers to the protein the capacity to insert at the lipid body surface . in addition _PROTEIN_ possesses a calcium binding domain . the study of plants deficient in caleosin revealed its involvement in storage lipid degradation during seed germination . using saccharomyces cerevisiae as a heterologous _PROTEIN_ system we investigated the potential role of _PROTEIN_ in lipid body biogenesis and filling . the green _METHOD_ protein tagged protein was correctly targeted to lipid bodies . we observed an increase in the number and size of lipid bodies . moreover transformed yeasts accumulated more fatty acids . we confirmed that this excess of fatty acids was due to overaccumulation of lipid body neutral lipids triacylglycerols and steryl esters . we showed that the original intrinsic properties of _PROTEIN_ protein were sufficient to generate a functional lipid body _LOCATION_ and to promote overaccumulation of storage lipids in yeast oil bodies .
in order to follow _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in yeast cells a _METHOD_ c terminally tagged version of the protein a powerful tool for monitoring the intracellular fate of heterologous or endogenous _LOCATION_ proteins was created . _PROTEIN_ was under the control of the galactose inducible gal promoter in order to check the potential toxicity of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in yeast . cell growth tests were performed on plates . cells _PROTEIN_ pgal _METHOD_ or pgal _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were spotted onto plates containing _PROTEIN_ or galactose as the _PROTEIN_ source . the size of colonies was weakly altered by the presence of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ when growth was performed on galactose containing medium but no toxicity was evidenced . the _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ was analyzed by immunoblot experiments using the polyclonal serum raised against the n terminal hydrophilic domain of the protein as described elsewhere . one band at kda was present in the galactose cultured cell extract but not in the _PROTEIN_ culture one corresponding to the proper fusion protein . as this anti caleosin serum also reacted with several yeast proteins we confirmed that the kda band detected was indeed _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ using antibodies raised against _METHOD_ . we also determined by time course experiments that the highest level of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was obtained after an overnight induction . an experiment conducted in planta revealed the localization of _PROTEIN_ at the periphery of seed lipid bodies . our previous immunoblot experiments revealed the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in yeast cells but it was necessary to demonstrate the correct targeting of the protein to lipid bodies before investigating the function of the protein . as _LOCATION_ a delta sterol c methyltransferase is localized specifically inside the lipid bodies this protein was selected as a specific marker for colocalization experiments . we introduced at the chromosomal locus of the _LOCATION_ gene the coding sequence a brighter fast maturing version of dsred leading to the _PROTEIN_ of an _METHOD_ c terminal tagged version of _LOCATION_ . this strain was transformed with the pgal _METHOD_ or the pgal _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ plasmids . experiments were first conducted on cells fully induced for _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ but due to the high level of _PROTEIN_ the protein was present in all the sucrose gradient fractions and the cells were too bright for observation of _METHOD_ punctuate staining under the microscope . to reduce the level of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ the induction was started after overnight growth in a raffinose containing medium . after h of galactose induction cells were collected for sucrose gradient fractionation and for observations under the microscope . lipid bodies from cells _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were purified by centrifugation on sucrose gradient density and were recovered in fractions and of the gradient as revealed by the presence of the kda _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ protein on western immunoblot experiments . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was mostly present in fractions and indicating the localization of the protein in lipid bodies . faint staining was also detectable in fractions and indicating that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ localization was not entirely restricted to lipid bodies or could be linked to the high _PROTEIN_ of the protein in the cells . indeed _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was one of the most abundant proteins in the lipid bodies . the cells were also observed under a microscope equipped with nomarski optics and for _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . cell observations confirmed the proper localization of _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ to lipid bodies clearly visible with nomarski optics . the same staining _PROTEIN_ like structures at the surface of lipid bodies was also evidenced for _METHOD_ _METHOD_ corresponding to the _PROTEIN_ fusion protein . these observations demonstrated that the correct targeting of the protein as its insertion at the surface of lipid bodies was similar to the localization observed for the endogenous _PROTEIN_ reported in a. thaliana seeds by citation . careful examination of cells _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ under the microscope pointed out potential morphological modifications affecting the size and number of lipid bodies per cell . a large cell to cell variability of lipid body number and size was also observed . this variability was correlated to the cell to cell heterogeneity of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ due to the wide range of induction of the gal promoter . indeed these observations were confirmed by electron microscopy of the ultrastructural morphology of cells induced for _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . analysis of cell thin sections revealed modifications in the intracellular organization of organelles with a significant proliferation of intracellular _LOCATION_ probably corresponding to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ often induced during strong heterologous _PROTEIN_ in yeast . we also observed that only a subset of cells presented a very high number of lipid bodies probably corresponding to cells fully induced for _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . these numerous lipid bodies were organized in clusters around proliferation _LOCATION_ sites where mitochondria were also stacked . we also observed the presence of contacts between oil bodies . in these _PROTEIN_ cells we detected a global increase of lipid body number per cell up to lipid bodies per cell whereas the control cells contained between and lipid bodies per cell . we also observed a wide range of lipid body sizes with larger structures than the control cells . because the morphological modifications observed on lipid bodies after _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ could lead to lipid accumulation we analyzed the lipid content of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ yeasts . we first focused our investigation on cell fatty acids which provided a rapid overview of the total cell lipid content . after overnight induction in a galactose containing medium cells were processed to obtain fame and the organic extract was separated by gc to determine the fame composition . we observed a significant accumulation of lipids in cells _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ when compared with the control cells leading to a statistically significant increase in the total fatty acid content of . according to the retention times obtained from fame standards we also determined the fatty acid composition of the yeast with major species and and minor species and . the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ did not modify the fame composition of yeast . to determine the nature of the lipids accumulated after _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ cellular lipids were analyzed by tlc after folch extraction . we decided to quantify storage neutral lipid triacylglycerols and steryl esters lipids specifically stored in lipid bodies . lipids from cells _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were analyzed and compared with those extracted from the control strain _PROTEIN_ only free _METHOD_ . quantification of each class of lipids revealed a significant variation in cells _PROTEIN_ at _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ for lipids specific for lipid bodies and not for other cellular lipid classes such as free fatty acids phospholipids and sterols . we observed that the impact on storage was most significant for neutral lipids and fold increases for steryl esters and triacylglycerols respectively and less significant for synthesis intermediates such as diacylglycerols and monoacylglycerols .
