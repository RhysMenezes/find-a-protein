aurora like kinases play key roles in chromosome segregation and cytokinesis in yeast plant and animal _METHOD_ . here we characterize three arabidopsis thaliana protein kinases designated and which share high amino acid identities with the ser/thr kinase domain of yeast and animal auroras . structure and _PROTEIN_ of and suggest that these genes arose by a recent gene duplication whereas the diversification of plant and aurora kinases predates the origin of land plants . the transcripts and proteins of all three kinases are most abundant in tissues containing dividing cells . intracellular localization of green _METHOD_ protein tagged atauroras revealed an ataurora type specific association _PROTEIN_ with dynamic mitotic structures such as microtubule spindles and centromeres and with the emerging cell plate of dividing tobacco by cells . immunolabeling using ataurora antibodies yielded specific signals at the centromeres that are coincident with histone that is phosphorylated at ser during mitosis . an in vitro kinase assay demonstrated that preferentially phosphorylates histone at ser but not at ser or thr and . the phylogenetic analysis of available aurora sequences from different eukaryotic origins suggests that although a plant aurora gene has been duplicated early in the evolution of plants the paralogs nevertheless _PROTEIN_ a role in cell cycle related signal transduction pathways .
aurora ser/thr kinases have a characteristic catalytic domain that is conserved in three arabidopsis aurora like genes and . the cdnas corresponding to the aurora like genes were isolated by rt pcr after the corresponding exonic sequences were identified using gene prediction _METHOD_ and published est sequences . the exon/intron structures of the arabidopsis aurora genes were deduced by comparison of cdna and genomic sequences . to encode predicted proteins of and amino acids . alignment reveals the conserved catalytic domain of arabidopsis aurora like kinases the budding yeast aurora kinase drosophila aurora and mouse aurora . the catalytic domain is highly conserved showing to identity between the different atauroras . it contains a motif in the activation loop in which is imbedded a residue that in animal _METHOD_ is phosphorylated by camp dependent kinase pka . downstream of the activation loop a type destruction box is present that may be subject to proteasome dependent targeting and protein degradation . at a similar position other aurora proteins also carry a degradation box that has been shown to be essential for human aurora protein degradation . the n and c terminal domains are more divergent and are presumably responsible for substrate specificity . to investigate the evolutionary relationship of the aurora family the conserved catalytic domain was used to build a phylogenetic tree . we searched the embl plant est database querying with the predicted protein sequences of atauroras . we identified ests from putative aurora like genes in angiosperm species and one member each in cycads ferns and mosses . all plant auroras are grouped in a plant specific clade divided in two major subgroups that we called plant aurora and plant aurora . the monocots zea mays oryza sativa and hordeum vulgare and the dicot arabidopsis had representatives in both subclades whereas lower plants contained only plant aurora arabidopsis has two aurora type copies that are highly similar at the nucleotide sequence level and in intron/exon structure suggesting that these originated via a relatively recent duplication event . the tissue distribution of ataurora _PROTEIN_ was determined by rna gel blot hybridization of total rna isolated from young roots _METHOD_ flower buds flowers fully expanded leaves and d old seedlings possessing small apical _METHOD_ and by semiquantitative rt pcr . specific aurora probes hybridized to rna of kb . high abundance of aurora transcripts was detected in root and flower tissue . remarkably fully expanded leaves and _METHOD_ contained little or no aurora rna . similarly transcript levels were high in flower buds as well as in extracts from cultured cells when analyzed by semiquantitative rt pcr . the aurora transcript levels paralleled those from _PROTEIN_ and transcription _PROTEIN_ suggesting that these samples were enriched for cycling transcripts . the elongation _PROTEIN_ subunit and actin were included as loading standards . because aurora rna was most abundant in extracts from tissue rich in dividing cells we plotted the rna profiles of the atauroras in synchronized arabidopsis tissue culture cells using publicly available affymetrix microarray datasets . the transcription profiles of and the strongly mitotically induced show that these four genes are activated together h after release from the aphidicolin block . the increase in mrna coincides with entry into mitosis when _PROTEIN_ of b type cyclins is upregulated . _PROTEIN_ of the auroras peaks at mitosis after which they are downregulated along with . shows the strongest induction level increasing approximately fivefold over the rna level before the onset of mitosis . the downregulation of atauroras overlaps with the end of mitosis to h after aphidicolin removal . to quantify the ataurora protein a polyclonal antibody against recombinant _PROTEIN_ in escherichia coli was generated . the reactivity of the antiserum was tested with the same mixture of the recombinant protein that was used for immunization of rabbits . the antiserum recognized a kd protein corresponding to the predicted molecular _METHOD_ of atauroras . the smaller extra band is background specific to bacteria . in view of the high similarity of the ataurora proteins and because the antibodies were prepared to a full length we anticipated a cross reaction with all three members of the protein family and will therefore refer to the antiserum as anti ataurora . high protein levels were detected in young roots flowers and flower buds of arabidopsis in accordance with the transcript abundance . a weaker immunosignal was detected in the protein extracts from seedlings and even less in extracts of mature leaves and old roots . no signal was obtained from siliques . the protein mobility in _METHOD_ and leaves of rosettes was shifted suggesting posttranslational modification of ataurora in these tissues . to establish the uniformity of loading of the various protein samples histone specific antibody staining is shown in figure . to analyze the cellular localization of plant auroras the open reading frames of and were fused upstream and downstream of the green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ coding sequence and the resulting constructs were introduced into tobacco by suspension cultures . fusions with _METHOD_ at the n terminal side produced more stable and intense _METHOD_ in by cells than fusions at the c terminal end . in interphase cells and were predominantly located in the _LOCATION_ . to study the distribution of the fusion proteins during cell division time lapse photographs were recorded . at the onset of prophase before _LOCATION_ envelope breakdown _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ were located on the cytoplasmic side of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ gradually migrating to the poles of the nascent spindle as mitosis progressed . upon formation of the spindle microtubular basket _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ associated with the microtubule fibrils and moved toward the midzone of the spindle . _PROTEIN_ both moved away from the spindle midzone toward the spindle poles . a weaker concentration of _METHOD_ was detectable in regions that colocalize with the position of the centromeres directed toward the spindle poles . _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ behavior was remarkably similar until the end of anaphase when _METHOD_ concentrated at the midline of the phragmoplast . it progressively followed the expansion of the cell plate until the mother wall was reached . _METHOD_ was much less abundant at the cell plate and it disappeared at the onset of expansion . in contrast with and that were evenly distributed in the nuclueus _METHOD_ concentrated in _LOCATION_ dots arranged around the nucleolus and at the _LOCATION_ periphery in early prophase cells . the diffuse perinuclear _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ at the position where the poles of the spindle are formed is presumably artifactual accumulation of the fusion product in an unknown compartment because we have seen this recurrently for other unrelated _METHOD_ fusion constructs in by lines . the strongest concentration of _METHOD_ occurred at or near the centromeres that became aligned during metaphase . _METHOD_ ataurora remained at the centromeres until a few minutes after the start of anaphase when the signals divided with chromosomes . then it became distributed to a granular component of the cytoplasm . we tested the ability of recombinant to phosphorylate histone in vitro . was _PROTEIN_ in insect cells using the baculovirus _PROTEIN_ system . the activity of the _PROTEIN_ was analyzed using a kinase assay with two different substrates . histone of arabidopsis was _PROTEIN_ in e. coli to ensure that posttranslational modifications were absent before the kinase assay . total histone extracts including isolated from calf thymus were used to test histone type specificity of . the possible influence of other potential posttranslational modifications of was not studied in detail but it is known from the literature that methylation and acetylation are competitive processes . the in vitro kinase assay demonstrates that like human aurora a and b proteins the immunoprecipitated showed protein kinase activity toward recombinant histone . histone was not phosphorylated when incubated with proteins of uninfected insect cells . the phosphorylation signal was also absent when antibody was added and when immunoprecipitated was omitted from the reaction mixtures or contained substrate only . the additional signals which correspond with the size of the antibody light chain are probably caused by nonspecific autophosphorylation of the antibody containing fraction . the preferential phosphorylation of histone was demonstrated by the kinase assay using total histones as substrate . the kinase assay with precipitated from infected insect cells with antirecombinant or with anti antibodies indicates a preferential phosphorylation by . in addition a weaker kinase activity toward histone and casein was observed . we next determined the amino acid residue of histone that is phosphorylated by . nonradioactive in vitro kinase assays performed with protein extracts from recombinant infected insect cells using recombinant histone as substrate and subsequent immunoblot analyses demonstrate a specific phosphorylation at ser of histone . no significant phosphorylation was detected at the histone sites ser thr thr or thr . to investigate whether is colocated on mitotic chromosomes with phosphorylated histone the subchromosomal location of ataurora was determined in mitotic chromosomes of field bean . this plant species was used because its large chromosomes allow a precise identification of subchromosomal domains . immunostaining with the anti ataurora antibody yielded _PROTEIN_ specific signals at the internal centromeric region . in the majority of the prophase _LOCATION_ the immunosignals appeared as globular domains which were further characterized by a distinct central signal gap . double labeling with anti ataurora and anti tubulin antibodies revealed a partial overlap between kinetochore localized tubulin and the ataurora specific signals . however ataurora signal was restricted to centromeric regions where sister chromatid cohesion persists longest and where the highest level of histone phosphorylation at ser occurs .

to standard procedures . equal loading of samples after spectrophotometric measurement was monitored by ethidium bromide staining and hybridization of rna _LOCATION_ with an actin specific cdna probe . cdna fragments from the genes tested were labeled with the megaprime labeling kit according to the manufacturer 's instructions and hybridized to the _LOCATION_ . filters were washed at high stringency . oligonucleotide primers corresponding to and full length cdnas were used for rt pcr . at the end of the primers a bp long restriction recognition site specific for swai/asci or bamhi/spei was added . pooled mrna of seedling flower bud root leave and stem rna was isolated using magnetic beads . the rt pcr products were cloned in pgem t easy vector . to avoid contamination with genomic dna primers overlapping intron/exon junctions were selected for semiquantitative rt pcr analysis . for rt pcr on control genes the following genes/primer pairs were used _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and phosphatase _PROTEIN_ . primers were designed to include the putative start and stop codons of the aurora genes resulting in the forward primers _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and the reverse primers aactctgtagattccagaaggatcagc tcctctgtaaaggcctgatggg and _PROTEIN_ to amplify the open reading frames of _GENE_ _GENE_ and _GENE_ respectively . gateway and sequence extensions were added for in frame cloning into to generate n terminal _METHOD_ aurora fusion products . c terminal _METHOD_ fusion constructs were as described before . transgenic by calli were mixed with of low melting agarose and spread onto the bottom of a well coverglass chamber and covered with fresh of fresh by medium . chambers were incubated at room temperature for h before imaging with a confocal laser scanning microscope composed of an inverted axiovert zeiss and equipped with a water corrected objective and an argon ion laser to generate nm light for _METHOD_ excitation . the images were captured with the _PROTEIN_ image acquisition software . images were exported as tiff files and processed with adobe photoshop . cdna corresponding to the entire and histone genes were cloned into vector and respectively and _PROTEIN_ in escherichia coli to generate n and c tag fusion peptides . these fusion peptides were purified on nickel agarose columns _PROTEIN_ under denaturing conditions with ph step elution to ph and used after dialyses in urea step gradient . polyclonal ataurora and histone antibodies were produced in rabbits by repeated injection over a time span of weeks . the

nitrocellulose _LOCATION_ . after blotting _LOCATION_ were reversibly stained with ponceau red . _LOCATION_ were incubated for h at in _PROTEIN_ and low fat milk or _PROTEIN_ bsa peg and pvp containing the appropriate antibody . secondary anti rabbit antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase were used to reveal immunocomplexes by enhanced chemiluminescence . samples of the nonradioative in vitro kinase assay were transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride _LOCATION_ and then the _LOCATION_ were incubated with antibodies against histone phosphorylated histone at thr ser thr ser or at thr . the open reading frame of cdna was subcloned into the his plasmid in frame with the n terminal his tag . cells were then transfected with the his plasmid using cellfectin according to the manufacturer 's instructions . transfected cells were tested by protein gel blot analysis for the presence of at aurora protein . the medium from these cells was used as recombinant baculoviruses stock for sf cell infection for h at for production of protein . for immunoprecipitation cells containing baculovirus recombinant were lysed in a buffer containing mm tris hcl ph mm nacl mm edta ph nonidet p and mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride . after sonication insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at . approximately of protein were immunoprecipitated by incubation at

_PROTEIN_ containing nm phosphatase inhibitor calyculin . immunoprecipitates were resuspended in a kinase assay buffer _PROTEIN_ and incubated for min at in the presence of of recombinant histone his tagged or of core histone mix from calf thymus together with from calf thymus . the kinase reaction was terminated by adding laemmli sample buffer followed by boiling . reaction mixtures were resolved by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ stained with _METHOD_ brilliant blue dried and autoradiographed . suspensions of _LOCATION_ and mitotic metaphase chromosomes of vicia faba were prepared as described by

washes in _PROTEIN_ for min each and incubated with the primary antirecombinant anti peptide antibodies or polyclonal rabbit antibody against histone phosphorylated at ser position . after h incubation at and washing for min in _PROTEIN_ the slides were incubated with corresponding secondary antibody _METHOD_ conjugates . for simultaneous immunostaining with anti tubulin antibody a microtubule stabilizing buffer was used instead of _PROTEIN_ . the anti tubulin antibody diluted was detected after incubation with fluorescein isothiocyanate conjugated anti mouse antibody diluted . _METHOD_ signals were observed using a microscope equipped with _METHOD_ optics . the images recorded with a cooled ccd camera were pseudocolored and merged using the program adobe photoshop . fourty
