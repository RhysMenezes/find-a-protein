in higher plant cytokinesis _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and cell wall originate by vesicle fusion in the plane of cell division . the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ gene which is required for cytokinesis encodes a protein related to vesicle docking syntaxins . we have raised specific rabbit antiserum against purified recombinant _PROTEIN_ protein to show biochemically and by immunoelectron microscopy that _PROTEIN_ protein is _LOCATION_ associated . using _METHOD_ microscopy _PROTEIN_ protein was found to be specifically _PROTEIN_ during mitosis and unlike the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ h _PROTEIN_ to localize to the plane of division during cytokinesis . arabidopsis dynamin like protein _PROTEIN_ accumulates at the plane of cell plate formation in knolle mutant cells as in wild type cells suggesting that cytokinetic vesicle traffic is not affected . furthermore electron microscopic analysis indicates that vesicle fusion is impaired . _PROTEIN_ protein was detected in mitotically dividing cells of various parts of the developing plant including seedling root inflorescence meristem floral _METHOD_ and ovules and the cellularizing endosperm but not during cytokinesis after the male second meiotic division . thus _PROTEIN_ is the first syntaxin like protein that appears to be involved specifically in cytokinetic vesicle fusion .
the nucleotide sequence of the _PROTEIN_ cdna predicted that the _PROTEIN_ protein like other syntaxins consists of an terminal variable region a conserved region of amino acids and a _PROTEIN_ terminal putative hydrophobic _LOCATION_ anchor _PROTEIN_ . recombinant _PROTEIN_ protein without the hydrophobic _PROTEIN_ terminus was purified from e. coli for generating polyclonal antiserum . the specificity of the antiserum was determined by western blot analysis of recombinant protein and by immunostaining of knolle mutant embryos . in western blots of plant cell extracts the _PROTEIN_ specific antiserum detected a protein of kd and if used at higher concentration an additional kd protein . _PROTEIN_ mrna was shown previously to accumulate preferentially in organs with actively dividing tissues such as developing flowers and siliques _PROTEIN_ . essentially the same organ distribution was observed for _PROTEIN_ protein . developing flowers and immature siliques which contain developing embryos showed the highest levels of _PROTEIN_ protein . roots and callus cells contained less _PROTEIN_ protein while almost none was detectable in young seedlings and leaves . this distribution suggested that _PROTEIN_ protein like its mrna is _PROTEIN_ in dividing cells . the subcellular distribution of _PROTEIN_ protein was determined by sucrose density gradient centrifugation of cell extracts . _PROTEIN_ protein was found in all gradient fractions although the highest levels were observed in denser fractions some of which contained the pm _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ protein showed essentially the same distribution as the arabidopsis dynamin like _PROTEIN_ protein which was recently shown to be localized to _LOCATION_ . samples of several fractions were processed for electron microscopy and stained with _PROTEIN_ antiserum and protein a gold . _PROTEIN_ positive material was observed on the surface of membranous material . the predicted amino acid sequence of the _PROTEIN_ gene product includes a _PROTEIN_ terminal hydrophobic stretch that could serve as a _LOCATION_ anchor _PROTEIN_ . to determine whether _PROTEIN_ is indeed an integral _LOCATION_ protein we investigated its association with _LOCATION_ under various experimental conditions such as alkaline ph high salt concentration or presence of detergent . cell extract was centrifuged at g. aliquots of the supernatant fraction were centrifuged at g to give supernatant and pellet fractions . the pellets were resuspended in different buffers and recentrifuged at g yielding wash fractions and pellets . the pellets were washed as before resulting in wash fractions and washed pellets . western blotting detected a _PROTEIN_ double band in the supernatant fraction but only the upper band in the supernatant fractions . by contrast the lower band was detected in the washed pellets except after treatment of the pellet with triton x which released _PROTEIN_ protein into the wash fraction . the other two treatments high salt concentration and alkaline ph released little or no _PROTEIN_ protein from the pellet respectively suggesting that _PROTEIN_ is an integral _LOCATION_ protein . for comparison _PROTEIN_ protein was recovered from the washed pellets after treatment with triton x but released into the wash fraction when the pellet had been resuspended at ph suggesting that _PROTEIN_ is a peripheral _LOCATION_ protein . in the presence of triton x _PROTEIN_ appears to be released from the _LOCATION_ but _METHOD_ a pelletable complex of kd . to determine whether the nonpelletable _PROTEIN_ protein was soluble or associated with a specific _LOCATION_ fraction we processed an aliquot of the supernatant for electron microscopy and immunogold labeling . as shown in fig . f _PROTEIN_ protein was attached to the surface of small vesicles as well as to lumps of membranous material . these data suggest that _PROTEIN_ protein is tightly associated with _LOCATION_ . to determine the intracellular localization of _PROTEIN_ protein throughout the cell cycle whole mount preparations of single cells from squashed embryos were doubly labeled with dapi and with _PROTEIN_ specific antiserum . no _PROTEIN_ signal was detected in interphase cells . _PROTEIN_ positive material accumulated in large patches during early m phase and predominantly in the plane of division in telophase cells . cells exiting from mitosis showed more diffuse _PROTEIN_ signals near the plane of division . to determine the sequence of events more precisely dividing embryonic cells were double stained with _PROTEIN_ specific antiserum and with anti tubulin antibody to visualize the microtubule _LOCATION_ . at the onset of mitosis a preprophase band of cortical microtubules marks the future plane of cell division _PROTEIN_ . some cells displaying the preprophase band contained large patches of _PROTEIN_ positive material while others did not suggesting that the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ protein started at or soon after the onset of mitosis . from prophase to anaphase _PROTEIN_ staining was detected only in large patches within the cytoplasm during these stages mitotic spindles formed and separated the sets of daughter chromosomes . the phragmoplast _METHOD_ during anaphase between the two sets of daughter chromosomes and narrows down in the center of the division plane during early telophase . in early telophase cells _PROTEIN_ positive material started to accumulate in the center of the phragmoplast . as the phragmoplast was displaced toward the periphery of the cell the _PROTEIN_ positive material extended from the center to the advancing edge of the phragmoplast . when the phragmoplast reached the _PROTEIN_ cortex of the cell the _PROTEIN_ positive disc extended across the entire plane of division although the _PROTEIN_ signal appeared weaker in the center than at the periphery . in the early interphase _PROTEIN_ staining was rarely found and if still present it appeared fragmented . thus the time course of _PROTEIN_ protein accumulation at the plane of cell division reflected the formation and _PROTEIN_ expansion of the cell plate . to address whether the _LOCATION_ of the cell plate is labeled by a marker for the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ we examined the distribution of pm _PROTEIN_ in cytokinetic cells . the pm _PROTEIN_ did not accumulate in the forming cell plate as demonstrated by double labeling with _PROTEIN_ . although the surface of the cytokinetic cell was decorated with pm _PROTEIN_ the developing cell plate only displayed the _PROTEIN_ signal . even when the _PROTEIN_ signal was confined to the periphery of the nearly complete cell plate pm _PROTEIN_ was excluded . since the entire surface of surrounding interphase cells was labeled with pm _PROTEIN_ we presume that pm _PROTEIN_ entered the newly formed _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ only after the _PROTEIN_ protein had disappeared from the cell plate . thus the developing cell plate appears to constitute a _LOCATION_ compartment that is topologically distinct from the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and is formed by a specialized set of cytokinetic transport vesicles . we examined the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ protein in whole mount preparations of single cells from embryos mutant for each of the three knolle alleles described so far is a stop codon mutation that truncates the _PROTEIN_ protein at amino acid is a frame shift mutation resulting in a _PROTEIN_ protein without the conserved region and the _PROTEIN_ terminal hydrophobic anchor and is a large deletion that removes about half the coding region and adjacent sequences _PROTEIN_ . mutant cells were analyzed during telophase as visualized by dapi staining . no _PROTEIN_ positive material was observed in kn mutant cells and in mutant cells for the two other kn alleles . thus all three mutations appear to interfere with the accumulation of stable mutant _PROTEIN_ protein . to address whether the lack of _PROTEIN_ protein interfered with the transport of _LOCATION_ vesicles to the plane of cell division we analyzed the intracellular distribution of the _LOCATION_ associated arabidopsis dynamin like _PROTEIN_ protein in cytokinetic cells using an antiserum raised against recombinant _PROTEIN_ . it had been shown previously that the dynamin like phragmoplastin from soybean was _PROTEIN_ in dividing as well as in nondividing cells and that a substantial fraction of pdl redistributed to the cell plate during cytokinesis _PROTEIN_ . we made the same observation for _PROTEIN_ and fig . c shows a wild type cell that accumulated _PROTEIN_ at the newly forming cell plate during cytokinesis . we also detected _PROTEIN_ at the plane of cell division in kn mutant cells suggesting that _LOCATION_ vesicles accumulated there in the absence of _PROTEIN_ protein . to visualize the cytokinesis defect in more detail we prepared serial sections of kn mutant embryos for em analysis . fig . a shows a diagram of an enlarged interphase cell displaying the characteristic features of incomplete cytokinesis such as several _LOCATION_ and fragments of internal cell walls . in addition bands of vesicles extend some of the wall fragments . at higher magnification a nearly wide band of vesicles appears to extend from the cell surface to the interior interrupted by islands of vesicle aggregates that enclose stretches of material that resembles the middle lamella of the cell wall . the vesicles are fairly uniform in size measuring nm in diameter and appear to be coated by electron dense material . the spaces between adjacent vesicles are free of ribosomes and paved with homogeneous material . we followed the extension of the vesicle band in adjacent sections and determined that the vesicles were actually arranged in a disc shaped structure that eventually joined a mature cell wall . these data imply that the lack of _PROTEIN_ protein does not block vesicle transport but impairs vesicle fusion during the formation of the cell plate . most cell divisions during plant development involve the phragmoplast assisted formation of a cell plate by vesicle fusion in the plane of division . however there are exceptions to this type of cytokinesis . for example the endosperm which surrounds the developing embryo passes through a syncytial stage of _LOCATION_ multiplication _LOCATION_ before cellularization by the simultaneous formation of cell walls between adjacent _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ . the cell walls grow in from the surface and _METHOD_ of vesicles nm in diameter and microtubules have been observed near the growing tips of cell walls . a special case of cytokinesis also occurs in male meiotic cells . after the two _LOCATION_ divisions the new cell walls grow in from the cell surface although microtubule arrays form a complex network of phragmoplast like structures _PROTEIN_ . to determine whether the _PROTEIN_ protein is generally involved in cytokinesis or only in divisions that deploy the phragmoplast assisted formation of a cell plate we studied the accumulation of _PROTEIN_ protein in various tissues undergoing cell division . in addition to embryonic cells _PROTEIN_ positive material was found in dividing cells in the seedling root in the inflorescence apex and in developing flowers . thus these somatic tissues appear to use _PROTEIN_ protein in cytokinesis . of the exceptional cases we analyzed the endosperm _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ protein . during cellularization hexagonal arrays of _PROTEIN_ positive material separated adjacent _LOCATION_ and _PROTEIN_ on the asynchronously dividing endosperm cells accumulated _PROTEIN_ positive material in the plane of cell division in much the same way as dividing embryo cells . the only truly exceptional case was the cytokinesis of the male meiotic cell . the sporogenous tissue of anthers which generates the male meiotic cells _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ protein essentially like somatic cells . as expected surrounding tapetum cells that were undergoing endomitosis but not cytokinesis did not give a _PROTEIN_ signal . also no _PROTEIN_ positive material accumulated during the cytokinesis of the male meiotic cell although phragmoplast like microtubule arrays formed between the four _LOCATION_ of the tetrad after the second _LOCATION_ division . thus the cytokinesis of the male meiotic cell appears to occur via a _PROTEIN_ independent mechanism .
