related protein kinase the plant kinase homolog of mammalian amp activated protein kinase is a sensor that _PROTEIN_ cellular energy homeostasis via control of anabolism/catabolism balance . ampk dependent phosphorylation of affects cell cycle progression autophagy and apoptosis . here we show that phosphorylates the arabidopsis thaliana cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor homologs _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ thus extending the role of this kinase to regulation of cell cycle progression . _PROTEIN_ and were phosphorylated in vitro by a recombinant activated catalytic subunit of . tandem _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and site specific mutagenesis identified and as the phosphorylated residues on _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ respectively . physically interacts with _PROTEIN_ in the _LOCATION_ of transformed by tobacco protoplasts but in contrast to mammals the _PROTEIN_ phosphorylation state alone did not modify its _LOCATION_ localization . using a heterologous yeast system consisting of a _PROTEIN_ yeast mutant complemented by a. thaliana cdka cell proliferation was shown to be abolished by _PROTEIN_ and by the non phosphorylatable form _PROTEIN_ but not by the phosphorylation mimetic form _PROTEIN_ . moreover a. thaliana _PROTEIN_ double over _PROTEIN_ plants showed an attenuated _PROTEIN_ associated phenotype . furthermore this severe phenotype was not observed in _PROTEIN_ over _PROTEIN_ plants . overall these results establish that the energy sensor plays a cardinal role in the control of cell proliferation in a. thaliana plants through inhibition of _PROTEIN_ biological function by phosphorylation .
the a. thaliana genome encodes seven cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor homologs identified on the basis of the presence of a short domain that is partially shared with mammalian cyclin dependent kinase inhibitors and is involved in the interaction with cdk/cyclin complexes . however this domain is located at the c terminus of plant proteins but the n terminus of mammalian proteins . furthermore although the amino acid similarity is restricted to this short domain all of these proteins belong to the intrinsically disordered protein family . the folding index profile of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ was determined using the prediction tool . as shown in figure _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ have a highly negative folding index profile similar to their animal counterpart . indeed using the same prediction tool while and cdka were shown to contain only and of protein residues that are predicted to be disordered this proportion reached and for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and respectively . an in silico analysis using scan prosite allowed detection of potential consensus phosphorylation sites in several atkrp proteins . we focused on _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ the only family members that displayed a common putative phosphorylation site in the cdk/cyclin interaction domain . interestingly _PROTEIN_ also contained a second consensus phosphorylation site at . to investigate whether phosphorylates _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in vitro glutathione s transferase _PROTEIN_ fused _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ proteins were produced in escherichia coli and purified . they were used in a reconstituted medium containing recombinant _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . in the absence of atkrp two phosphorylated proteins were observed corresponding to _PROTEIN_ which is phosphorylated by _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ which is both autophosphorylated and feedback phosphorylated by activated as previously shown . interestingly when either _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ were present in the reaction mixture autoradiography showed that both proteins incorporated phosphate from radiolabelled _PROTEIN_ . this phosphorylation was dependent on activated as _PROTEIN_ alone was unable to phosphorylate _PROTEIN_ . a tandem _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ analysis of in vitro phosphorylated _PROTEIN_ indicated that peptides containing the common consensus target site previously identified in silico _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were phosphorylated . the _PROTEIN_ phosphorylation site was unambiguously identified as however doubt remained _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ as the peptide contained two closely located threonine residues . to resolve this ambiguity a site directed mutagenesis strategy was used and the following _PROTEIN_ mutated _METHOD_ were produced _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . in the reconstituted medium both the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutant _METHOD_ exhibited phosphorylation on whereas _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ did not show phosphorylation . thus clearly the dependent phosphorylation sites on _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are at and respectively . to better understand the function of this post translational modification it was decided to focus only on _PROTEIN_ . bold letters indicate residues or for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ respectively . in order to investigate this post translational modification in vivo we first addressed the question of whether physically interacts in planta with _PROTEIN_ . after transient _PROTEIN_ in by tobacco protoplasts using bimolecular _METHOD_ complementation _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was detected in several protoplasts demonstrating that and _PROTEIN_ are interacting partners in vivo . in addition this interaction only occurred in the _LOCATION_ in accordance with the known subcellular localizations of and _PROTEIN_ which are nucleocytoplasmic and _LOCATION_ respectively . in mammals phosphorylation by ampk on induces its cytoplasmic re localization . to investigate the effect of _PROTEIN_ phosphorylation on its subcellular localization chimeric _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ proteins _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were transiently _PROTEIN_ in a. thaliana protoplasts . both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ showed _LOCATION_ localization like the wt form . thus it appears that under our conditions phosphorylation alone does not lead to re localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ to the cytoplasm . to assess the biological function of _PROTEIN_ phosphorylation on cdk/cyclin complexes it was first necessary to investigate whether a. thaliana _PROTEIN_ was capable of altering cell division . to this end a heterologous system in yeast was set up taking advantage of the ability of a. thaliana cdka to functionally complement the absence of the unique yeast cdk _PROTEIN_ . to perform more efficient complementation of the yeast _PROTEIN_ mutant a mutated atcdka variant atcdka af harbouring and mutations to circumvent their potential inhibitory phosphorylation was generated _PROTEIN_ . mutated yeast _PROTEIN_ cells which are unable to divide at a restrictive temperature were complemented by atcdka af leading to yeast cell multiplication . the complemented yeast cells were then transformed with either wt or mutated _PROTEIN_ . interestingly _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ appeared to block cell division thus confirming the inhibitory function of _PROTEIN_ on cell division . in contrast the phosphorylation mimetic form _PROTEIN_ did not alter the complementation process strongly suggesting that the phosphorylation event abolishes the _PROTEIN_ inhibitory effects on atcdka . in order to unravel the molecular mechanism involved the interactions of the phosphorylation mimetic form _PROTEIN_ with cdk and cyclin partners were assessed in a two hybrid system . it had been established previously by a two hybrid approach that _PROTEIN_ interacts with a. thaliana cdka . as shown in figure _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ interact to a similar degree with atcdka af the atcdka variant . we then tested the interaction of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ with a d type cyclin the second partner in the cdk/cyclin complex which was previously shown to be a true partner of _PROTEIN_ in planta . interestingly the phosphorylation mimetic form _PROTEIN_ partially lost its ability to interact with its cyclin partner . taken together these results suggest that the inability of the phosphorylation mimetic form _PROTEIN_ to inhibit cdk kinase activity may be due to loss of its interaction with the cyclin partner of the cdk/cyclin complex . finally experiments were performed to clarify the function of _PROTEIN_ phosphorylation in a. thaliana . the phenotype of plants constitutively over _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ has been described previously . most of the krp family members over _PROTEIN_ in a. thaliana display several common features including rosette size reduction increased cell size characteristic leaf serration and a reduced capacity of mesophyll cells to undergo callogenesis . here we first confirmed that _PROTEIN_ over _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ induced the same pleiotropic and gradual developmental alterations . the severity of the phenotype is in agreement with an increase in _PROTEIN_ transcript levels and also with higher mrna levels for two d type cyclins and . several phenotypic classes were determined according to leaf serration namely wt l for plants displaying a wt like phenotype and ls _METHOD_ ss and _PROTEIN_ for lightly moderately severely and highly serrated phenotypes respectively _PROTEIN_ . this classification of the plant population was validated by analysing several plants from each class using two others parameters the capacity of mesophyll cells to undergo callogenesis and the size of leaf epidermis cells . the ability to produce calli was quantified by weighing the leaf explants to determine the fresh weight increase _PROTEIN_ . this _PROTEIN_ gradually _PROTEIN_ in accordance with the severity of the serration phenotype whereas the cell size dramatically increased . indeed the proportion of cells with an area above which is very low in the wt l plants reaches in _PROTEIN_ plants . based on the results mentioned above we hypothesized that at phosphorylation of _PROTEIN_ on interferes with _PROTEIN_ function in planta . to assess this we generated double oe plants _PROTEIN_ . these plants were classified according to their leaf serration phenotype as described above . we observed that the plants in each class of this population present the same parameters as the plants of the corresponding class in the oe _PROTEIN_ population . interestingly by comparing the distribution of the plants in the various classes for the two genotypes we found that over _PROTEIN_ partially reversed the oe _PROTEIN_ phenotype . while the plant population over _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ alone showed variable severity of the expected developmental alterations with classified as wt l as intermediate phenotype _METHOD_ ss and _PROTEIN_ the population over _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ together with displayed a shift towards the wt like phenotype _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . this shift towards the wt like phenotype is due to a slight _PROTEIN_ in the proportions of all the other classes . in oe plants the higher content allows more _PROTEIN_ to be phosphorylated but not all especially in plants containing the highest amount of _PROTEIN_ . consequently oe only partially reversed the oe _PROTEIN_ effect . to try to get a stronger reversion plants over _PROTEIN_ the phosphorylation mimetic form _PROTEIN_ were produced and classified as above according to the serration criteria . the same correlation was observed between the classification of plants as wt l ls etc . and callogenesis capacity/cell size parameters . remarkably the proportions of _PROTEIN_ and ss plants drastically _PROTEIN_ among the oe _PROTEIN_ population while the proportion of wt l plants reached _PROTEIN_ . this result shows a very clear effect on the oe _PROTEIN_ phenotype of mimicking the _PROTEIN_ phosphorylation status . measuring the leaf rosette diameter confirmed this result . indeed the population of oe _PROTEIN_ plants clearly shifted towards the large rosette phenotype . collectively these data suggest that phosphorylates _PROTEIN_ in planta and this alters cell proliferation .
