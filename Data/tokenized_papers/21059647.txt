competitive inhibition of transcription _PROTEIN_ by small proteins is an intriguing component of gene regulatory networks in both animals and plants . the small interfering proteins possess limited sequence homologies to specific transcription _PROTEIN_ but lack one or more protein motifs required for transcription _PROTEIN_ activities . they interfere with the activities of transcription _PROTEIN_ such as dna binding and transcriptional activation by forming nonfunctional heterodimers . a potential example is the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ protein consisting of residues . it has a zinc finger domain but lacks other protein motifs normally present in transcription _PROTEIN_ . in this work we show that _PROTEIN_ and its functional homologues physically interact with a group of zinc finger homeodomain transcription _PROTEIN_ such as _PROTEIN_ that regulate floral architecture and leaf development . gel mobility shift assays revealed that _PROTEIN_ blocks the dna binding activity of _PROTEIN_ homodimers by competitively forming _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ heterodimers . accordingly the transcriptional activation activity of _PROTEIN_ was significantly suppressed by _PROTEIN_ coexpressed transiently in arabidopsis protoplasts . notably _PROTEIN_ also prevents _PROTEIN_ from _LOCATION_ localization . although _PROTEIN_ was localized exclusively in the _LOCATION_ it was scattered throughout the cytoplasm when _PROTEIN_ was coexpressed . transgenic plants overexpressing the _PROTEIN_ gene _PROTEIN_ exhibited accelerated growth with larger leaves . consistent with the negative regulation of _PROTEIN_ by _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ phenotypes were diminished by _PROTEIN_ coexpression . these observations indicate that _PROTEIN_ regulates the _PROTEIN_ activities in a dual step manner _LOCATION_ import and dna binding .
the mif proteins have limited sequence similarities to the zhd transcription _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . however they are structurally distinct from the zhd proteins . whereas both have the zf motifs that mediate protein protein interactions the mif proteins lack the hd domains that are required for dna protein interactions in many dna binding proteins . these structural characteristics are analogous to those of the _PROTEIN_ and zpr proteins which act as competitive inhibitors of the basic leucine zipper and hd _PROTEIN_ iii transcription _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . it was therefore hypothesized that the mif proteins would be functionally similar to known competitive peptide inhibitors . we first examined whether the mif proteins interact with the zhd proteins by yeast two hybrid assays using the mif proteins as baits and the zhd proteins as preys . we determined the relative strengths of the interactions by measuring cell densities . as inferred from the protein structural analysis the mif proteins interacted with a subset of the zhd proteins . notably the interaction patterns were quite diverse . the mif proteins interacted strongly with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . in contrast they did not exhibit any discernible interactions with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . although _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ interacted with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ did not . in addition only _PROTEIN_ showed measurable interaction with _PROTEIN_ . yeast two hybrid assays on the mif zhd interactions . the mif zhd interactions were examined by yeast two hybrid assays . relative strengths of the interactions are indicated . very strong moderate weak no interaction . the mif zhd interactions were also examined by measuring galactosidase activities in yeast cells _PROTEIN_ different combinations of mif and zhd genes . the overall patterns of interactions were quite similar to those obtained by measuring cell growth on selective medium . one distinction was the high galactosidase activity in yeast cells _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ genes which was in contrast to the absence of interaction in the measurements of cell growth on selective medium . this may be because the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ dimers somehow repress yeast cell growth . the _PROTEIN_ protein has been molecular genetically characterized and its role in growth hormone signaling has been examined through transgenic approaches and genome wide _PROTEIN_ studies _PROTEIN_ . our data indicated that _PROTEIN_ strongly interacts with _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ as well as _PROTEIN_ . therefore the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ proteins were chosen for further analysis . the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ interactions were further examined by in vitro pull down assays using a recombinant _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ fusion protein prepared in e. coli cells and a methionine labeled in vitro translation product of the _PROTEIN_ gene . the results showed that _PROTEIN_ bound strongly to _PROTEIN_ . in contrast it did not bind to _PROTEIN_ supporting the specific interaction between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . to verify the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ interaction a methionine labeled _PROTEIN_ peptide was produced by in vitro translation and the _PROTEIN_ protein was produced as a recombinant _PROTEIN_ fusion in e. coli cells . in vitro pull down assays showed that the _PROTEIN_ protein bound strongly to the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ fusion . however no visible binding was observed between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . together these observations demonstrate that the _PROTEIN_ protein interacts physically with the _PROTEIN_ transcription _PROTEIN_ . interaction between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ via the zf motif . for the in vitro pull down assays the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ proteins were prepared either as recombinant _PROTEIN_ fusions in e. coli cells or as methionine labeled in vitro translation products . the _PROTEIN_ protein was also included in the assays . lanes no addition of methionine labeled proteins . the bound proteins were eluted using _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ loading buffer and resolved on a _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . one of the in vitro translation reaction mixture was loaded . in a b and d part of the _METHOD_ blue stained gel is displayed as a loading control . a in vitro pull down assays using recombinant _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ fusion protein and methionine labeled _PROTEIN_ . b in vitro pull down assays using recombinant _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ fusion protein and methionine labeled _PROTEIN_ . c mapping of the interacting domain . a full size and a series of truncated _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were produced by in vitro translation . ten percent of each reaction was loaded on the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . the plus and minus symbols indicate either positive interaction or no visible interaction as assayed in d. d in vitro pull down assays using a _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ fusion protein and methionine labeled _PROTEIN_ proteins . sm size marker . the zhd proteins form homodimers and/or heterodimers . our data showed that the _PROTEIN_ protein bound to the _PROTEIN_ protein suggesting that the _PROTEIN_ protein would also form homodimers . to examine this possibility we performed in vitro pull down assays using a methionine labeled in vitro translation product of the _PROTEIN_ gene and a recombinant _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ fusion . as expected the _PROTEIN_ protein bound to the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ fusion demonstrating that the _PROTEIN_ protein _METHOD_ homodimers as well as heterodimers with the zhd proteins . we also examined whether the _PROTEIN_ protein _METHOD_ homodimers by in vitro pull down assays using a methionine labeled _PROTEIN_ and a recombinant _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ fusion . we found that the _PROTEIN_ protein also _METHOD_ homodimers as has been suggested previously . no interaction was detected between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . it was observed that the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ proteins form heterodimers via the zf motifs . to map the interacting domain we produced a series of truncated _PROTEIN_ proteins by in vitro translation and carried out in vitro pull down assays using a recombinant _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ fusion protein . the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ protein bound specifically to the full size _PROTEIN_ form and a truncated form having the zf motif . in contrast the _PROTEIN_ protein did not interact with any of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . these observations indicate that the zf motif is responsible for the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ interaction . it has been recently reported that the _PROTEIN_ protein and perhaps other zhd proteins as well binds to a nucleotide sequence _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ core sequence is a canonical binding site for many hd domain containing proteins . to examine whether the _PROTEIN_ protein influences the dna binding activity of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were conducted using recombinant _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mbp fusion proteins and a labeled dna fragment containing the _PROTEIN_ core sequence . the _PROTEIN_ mbp fusion protein bound to the dna fragment possibly as dimers but the binding disappeared in the presence of an excess amount of competitor dna . western blot analysis following _METHOD_ revealed that the _PROTEIN_ protein bound to the dna fragment primarily as dimers although _PROTEIN_ monomers also bound to the dna fragment . inhibition of dna binding and transcriptional activation activities of _PROTEIN_ by _PROTEIN_ . a _METHOD_ . recombinant _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ proteins were prepared as _PROTEIN_ and mbp fusions respectively in e. coli cells . increasing amounts of _PROTEIN_ were added to the assays . excess amounts of competitor dna were included in the assays . the arrowhead indicates _PROTEIN_ homodimer or _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ heterodimer . the arrow indicates _PROTEIN_ monomer . b western blot and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ analyses of proteins eluted from _METHOD_ shifted bands . pu purified _PROTEIN_ mbp or _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ fusions from e. coli cells and proteins eluted from parts as marked by elution of lanes and respectively of the _METHOD_ gel in a . western blot analyses were carried out using a monoclonal anti mbp or a polyclonal anti _PROTEIN_ antibody . the arrowhead indicates _PROTEIN_ mbp and the arrow indicates _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . c schematic representation of the effector and reporter constructs used . translation enhancer . nos t nos terminator . d transient _PROTEIN_ assays in arabidopsis protoplasts . the empty vector without cdna insert was included as control . for normalization of transformation efficiencies the camv promoter luciferase vector was cotransformed in each assay . three independent measurements were averaged and statistically treated using student 's t test . _LOCATION_ bars s.e . however the mbp protein alone did not bind to the dna fragment under identical assay conditions confirming that the _PROTEIN_ protein binds specifically to the _PROTEIN_ containing dna fragment . the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ fusion protein did not show any detectable binding to the dna fragment which is consistent with the lack of dna binding domain in the _PROTEIN_ protein . we next included the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ fusion protein in the dna binding assays of the _PROTEIN_ mbp fusion protein . the results showed that binding of the _PROTEIN_ mbp homodimers to the dna fragment _PROTEIN_ in the presence of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ fusion protein in a dose dependent manner indicating that the _PROTEIN_ protein prevents the _PROTEIN_ homodimers from dna binding . to examine whether the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ heterodimers are formed in the _METHOD_ proteins were eluted from the shifted bands and subjected to western blot analysis using an anti mbp or an anti _PROTEIN_ antibody . the results showed that the protein complexes bound to dna contained both the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ proteins indicating that the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ heterodimers bind to the dna fragment but with a significantly reduced signal intensity of the dna protein complex . this may be related to the previous observation in which it has been found that the zhd proteins form various heterodimers more readily than homodimers . a question was whether the _PROTEIN_ protein influences the transcriptional activation activity of the _PROTEIN_ homodimers and whether the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ heterodimers possess the transcriptional activation activity . to answer the question leaf mesophyll protoplasts were prepared from arabidopsis plants harboring a gus reporter vector in which a fusion of the gus gene with four tandem repeats of the _PROTEIN_ sequence was subcloned upstream of the camv minimal promoter . a couple of effector vectors were constructed by subcloning the _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ cdna sequence under the control of the camv promoter and transformed into the mesophyll protoplasts . gus activity assays revealed that _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ protein increased the gus activity fold . in contrast _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ protein did not have any discernible effects on the gus activity . when the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ proteins were coexpressed the gus activity _PROTEIN_ to a basal level . these observations indicate that the _PROTEIN_ protein inhibits the transcriptional activation activity of the _PROTEIN_ protein . it is also clear that the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ heterodimers are not transcriptionally active . our data showed that _PROTEIN_ is a transcriptional activator suggesting that it is a _LOCATION_ protein . it was therefore hypothesized that the _PROTEIN_ protein may also affect the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ . we examined the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ using a _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein in arabidopsis protoplasts . the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein was localized predominantly into the _LOCATION_ . _LOCATION_ localization of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein was also confirmed by transient _PROTEIN_ in onion epidermal cells and dapi staining . we next determined the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ . a _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ gene fusion was _PROTEIN_ transiently in arabidopsis protoplasts . the _METHOD_ signal was detected in small vesicle like structures in the cytoplasm although the identity of the small vesicle like structures is unknown . weak _METHOD_ signal was also detected in the _LOCATION_ of a few cells examined . modulation of the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ by _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis protoplasts . arabidopsis mesophyll protoplasts were transformed with the indicated constructs such as _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ vector only _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and visualized by _METHOD_ microscopy h after transformation . d and e show the _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ signals of coexpressed _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ proteins respectively . g image of the reconstructed _METHOD_ signals . h _METHOD_ image . f and i superimposed images . we next examined whether the _PROTEIN_ protein influences the subcellular localization of the _PROTEIN_ protein by employing two different approaches one is coexpression of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusions and the other is reconstitution of _METHOD_ signals by bifc . we first coexpressed the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusions transiently in arabidopsis protoplasts and visualized both _METHOD_ markers simultaneously by confocal _METHOD_ microscopy . both the _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ signals were distributed in small vesicle like structures in the cytoplasm a pattern similar to that of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ distribution showing that the subcellular localization of the _PROTEIN_ protein is altered by the _PROTEIN_ protein . image analysis of reconstituted _METHOD_ signals was also carried out to examine the effects of the _PROTEIN_ protein on the subcellular localization of the _PROTEIN_ protein . the bifc assay involves the reconstitution of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ upon association of the _METHOD_ n terminal and c terminal fragments of _METHOD_ . the _PROTEIN_ protein was fused to the n terminal fragment of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and the _PROTEIN_ protein was fused to the c terminal fragment of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . we observed that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ a bifc complex with _PROTEIN_ indicating that the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ complexes readily form in vivo . furthermore the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was detected in small vesicle like structures as observed in the coexpression assays . these observations further confirm the interaction of the _PROTEIN_ protein with the _PROTEIN_ protein and demonstrate that the _PROTEIN_ protein inhibits the _LOCATION_ import of the _PROTEIN_ protein . our data indicated that the _PROTEIN_ protein inhibits dna binding and _LOCATION_ import of the _PROTEIN_ protein . we therefore investigated whether the _PROTEIN_ protein inhibits the _PROTEIN_ function in planta . we produced arabidopsis transgenic plants overexpressing the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ genes driven by the camv promoter . the _PROTEIN_ transgenic plants exhibited dwarfed growth with small dark green leaves . in addition the leaf surface was shiny as has been observed previously _PROTEIN_ . transgenic plants overexpressing the _PROTEIN_ gene _PROTEIN_ exhibited accelerated growth with larger leaves which is in inverse to the _PROTEIN_ phenotypes . the _PROTEIN_ transgenic plants were then genetically crossed with the _PROTEIN_ transgenic plants resulting in the _PROTEIN_ plants . qrt pcr assays of gene transcript levels revealed that overexpression of the _PROTEIN_ gene did not influence the _PROTEIN_ gene transcription and vice versa excluding the possibility of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ interactions at the transcriptional level . phenotypic recovery of transgenic plants overexpressing _PROTEIN_ by _PROTEIN_ coexpression . a phenotypes of transgenic plants . the _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ gene was overexpressed under the control of the camv promoter . five week old transgenic plants grown in soil were photographed . the _PROTEIN_ plants were produced by genetic cross of the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ transgenic plants . the inlet shows an enlarged view of the _PROTEIN_ transgenic plant . b _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ genes in the transgenic plants . transcript levels were determined by qrt pcr using total rna samples extracted from week old whole plants grown on _METHOD_ agar plates . biological triplicates were averaged . _LOCATION_ bars s.e . statistical significance was determined using student 's t test . c measurements of plant heights . thirty plants fully grown in soil were measured and averaged . d measurements of leaf areas . a series of rosette leaves from representative plants were photographed . leaf areas were measured using the eighth rosette leaves of plants and averaged for each plant group . _LOCATION_ bars s.e . . e cell sizes . sizes of the cells from the adaxial sides of leaves were compared by _PROTEIN_ and the labwork image acquisition and analysis program . statistical significance of the cell size measurements was determined by student 's t test . scale bars . f floral structures . floral structures were compared by _PROTEIN_ . parts of sepals and _PROTEIN_ were removed to visualize internal structures . scale bars . the overall phenotypes of the _PROTEIN_ plants resembled those of wild type plants . the height of the _PROTEIN_ plants was also close to that of wild type plants . the _PROTEIN_ leaves were somewhat smaller than wild type and _PROTEIN_ transgenic leaves but much larger than the _PROTEIN_ transgenic leaves . we also examined the leaf epidermal cells by _PROTEIN_ . although the epidermal cells of the _PROTEIN_ transgenic leaves were smaller than those of the wild type leaves they were larger in the _PROTEIN_ transgenic leaves . notably the epidermal cells of the _PROTEIN_ leaves were only slightly larger than those of the wild type leaves . these observations indicate that the _PROTEIN_ phenotypes were efficiently rescued by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ further supporting the _PROTEIN_ regulation of the _PROTEIN_ activities . the _PROTEIN_ transgenic plants had distorted floral structures such as short crooked filaments and enlarged twisted gynoecium . in contrast the reproductive organs were essentially normal in the _PROTEIN_ transgenic plants . the _PROTEIN_ plants also had normal floral structures . the morphological recovery of floral structures in the _PROTEIN_ plants would be explained by the suppression of the _PROTEIN_ effects by the _PROTEIN_ protein through protein protein interaction . taken together our data demonstrate that the _PROTEIN_ protein serves as a negative regulator of the _PROTEIN_ transcription _PROTEIN_ by forming nonfunctional heterodimers . the _PROTEIN_ regulation of the _PROTEIN_ activities occurs both in the cytoplasm and _LOCATION_ . whereas the _PROTEIN_ protein blocks the _LOCATION_ import of the _PROTEIN_ protein in the cytoplasm it inhibits the dna binding activity of the _PROTEIN_ homodimers in the _LOCATION_ . this view is also consistent with the distribution of the _PROTEIN_ protein both in the cytoplasm and _LOCATION_ . schematic working model of _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ protein inhibits _LOCATION_ localization of the _PROTEIN_ protein by forming _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ heterodimers in the cytoplasm . in the _LOCATION_ the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ heterodimers have a lower dna binding activity compared with that of the _PROTEIN_ homodimers .
