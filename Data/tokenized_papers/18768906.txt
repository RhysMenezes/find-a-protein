we compare three arabidopsis complex _PROTEIN_ alleles and report on genetic interaction with staurosporin and temperature _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ encodes a subunit of oligosaccharyltransferase that affects efficiency of n glycan transfer to nascent secretory proteins in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ mutants lack n acetyl _PROTEIN_ i activity and are unable to form complex n glycans in the _LOCATION_ apparatus . by studying _PROTEIN_ green _METHOD_ protein fusions in transient assays we show that the extra n glycosylation site created by a point mutation in _PROTEIN_ is used in planta and interferes with folding of full length _LOCATION_ anchored polypeptides in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . tunicamycin treatment or _PROTEIN_ in the _PROTEIN_ mutant relieved the folding block and migration to _LOCATION_ stacks resumed . complementation tests with green _METHOD_ protein and other n glycosylation variants of _PROTEIN_ demonstrated that suppression of aberrant n glycosylation restores activity . interestingly _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ to be functional also as nonglycosylated enzyme . two other _PROTEIN_ alleles showed splicing defects of their transcripts . in _PROTEIN_ a point mutation affects the splice site of intron resulting in frame shifts in _PROTEIN_ t intron fails to splice due to insertion of a t dna copy . introgression of _PROTEIN_ did not restore complex glycan formation in _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ t but suppressed the n acetyl _PROTEIN_ i defect in _PROTEIN_ . root growth assays revealed synergistic effects in double mutants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ t _PROTEIN_ only . besides demonstrating the conditional nature of _PROTEIN_ in planta our observations with loss of function alleles _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ t in the _PROTEIN_ underglycosylation background prove that correct n glycosylation is important for normal root growth and morphology in arabidopsis .
we addressed the molecular basis for missing complex glycan formation in three available arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ alleles . mutants _PROTEIN_ and were originally identified in a screen of _METHOD_ mutagenized seedlings and shown to contain mrna levels comparable to those of the wild type . sequence analyses of pcr amplified genomic dna fragments proved that both result from single g to a base changes . for _PROTEIN_ our data confirmed the change at position reported by citation . besides altering a conserved sequence motif the mutation creates a new n glycosylation site in the context of arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ . for _PROTEIN_ we established that the g to a change at position alters the splice site of intron . insertion mutant _PROTEIN_ t was identified in the signal salk database . genomic pcr analyses confirmed that a single t dna resides within intron . sequence analyses of both border fragments located the t dna insertion at position without any base deletion . in order to confirm the predicted molecular defects in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ t at the transcript level we characterized the structures of mutant _PROTEIN_ transcripts by reverse transcription pcr and sequence analyses . for _PROTEIN_ sequencing the products amplified with and revealed that intron is aberrantly spliced by shifting the splice site to the next g introducing a translational frame shift . larger pcr products found in _PROTEIN_ were aberrant transcripts that retain intron and . for _PROTEIN_ t transcripts were characterized using primers binding upstream or flanking the t dna insertion . rt pcr with upstream primer pairs and detected wild type transcript levels however pcr using primer pairs and flanking the t dna insertion yielded no product for _PROTEIN_ t . this demonstrated that _PROTEIN_ t does not produce intact _PROTEIN_ transcripts . since we could detect chimeric _PROTEIN_ t dna transcripts it appears that mature _PROTEIN_ t transcripts contain unspliced intron with an additional kb of t dna sequence . in both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ t the mutations create premature stop codons a few codons downstream of the mutated sites . due to the change _PROTEIN_ polypeptides most likely acquire a second n glycan upon cotranslational insertion into the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . based on a three dimensional model of the catalytic domain the change lies in a buried region of the protein whereas native glycan is exposed at the surface . citation compared the secretion of soluble versions of rabbit and arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ proteins in insect cells . they deduced that neoglycosylated polypeptides are inactive due to aberrant folding and do not leave the _LOCATION_ . in order to determine whether reduced frequency of n glycosylation can specifically restore _PROTEIN_ function of _PROTEIN_ in planta the viable _PROTEIN_ allele was introgressed into all three arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ lines . _PROTEIN_ encodes an isoform of ost subunit _PROTEIN_ and the _PROTEIN_ mutation was previously shown to cause underglycosylation of glycoproteins . both double mutants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ t _PROTEIN_ failed to react with complex glycan antiserum on immunoblots . this however was not the case for the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant lines . compared with the wild type and the _PROTEIN_ single mutants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ displayed intermediate complex glycosylation patterns on immunoblots . it is noteworthy that the complex glycosylation pattern and intensity in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ match exactly those of the _PROTEIN_ parent . thus despite the change in a highly conserved _PROTEIN_ motif _PROTEIN_ polypeptides appear to retain sufficient activity to restore complex glycosylation in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . in order to test the n glycosylation status of _PROTEIN_ variants cdna fragments encoding wild type and mutated _PROTEIN_ variants were fused to _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis wild type and _PROTEIN_ mutant protoplasts . the variants of _PROTEIN_ tested include _PROTEIN_ and . experiments were conducted in both the presence and absence of proteasome inhibitor mg to prevent potential degradation of aberrant fusion proteins which gave similar results . consistent with the expected n glycosylation states _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ variants displayed different mobilities in anti _METHOD_ immunoblot analyses of transformed protoplasts . in both wild type and _PROTEIN_ mutant protoplasts _PROTEIN_ variants showed similar electrophoretic mobility . furthermore protein levels of _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ were lower than those of wild type _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and unglycosylated _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in both genotypes . in _PROTEIN_ protoplasts we occasionally observed additional bands for _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ whose mobility is consistent with underglycosylated polypeptide _METHOD_ . interestingly treatment with the n glycosylation inhibitor tunicamycin promoted the accumulation of _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ in both wild type and _PROTEIN_ genotypes . this indicated that aberrant n glycosylation interferes with the stability of _PROTEIN_ polypeptides in plant cells . nevertheless since complex glycosylation is restored in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant it appears that small amounts of underglycosylated _PROTEIN_ polypeptides _PROTEIN_ catalytic activity . since aberrant glycosylation of _PROTEIN_ polypeptides may also affect _LOCATION_ targeting we determined the subcellular location of _METHOD_ protein fusions using confocal laser scanning microscopy . in transfected arabidopsis protoplasts _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ both labeled _LOCATION_ stacks as indicated by shape size and characteristic stop and go movements . furthermore _METHOD_ signals were redistributed into _LOCATION_ hybrid compartments upon incubation with brefeldin a . when mutated _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ constructs were analyzed in ecotype columbia wild type protoplasts green _METHOD_ was not detected in _LOCATION_ stacks labeled by _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ but faint _METHOD_ signals could be seen in the _LOCATION_ and in certain areas of the _LOCATION_ . this indicates that _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ are not delivered to the _LOCATION_ apparatus but are likely degraded in the _LOCATION_ . in the presence of tunicamycin col wild type protoplasts transformed with either _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ constructs developed a typical _LOCATION_ pattern within h after transfection that colocalized with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ used as an internal control . this showed that blocking n glycosylation can restore protein folding of _PROTEIN_ independent of the altered amino acid motif so that migration to _LOCATION_ stacks resumes . _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ constructs in protoplasts of the _PROTEIN_ mutant resulted in _LOCATION_ labeling within h similar to tunicamycin treated wild type protoplasts . in the _PROTEIN_ mutant background however signal intensities of _LOCATION_ stacks were much lower than in tunicamycin treated wild type protoplasts perhaps because only a small proportion of _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ polypeptides are underglycosylated and allowed to exit the _LOCATION_ . in order to biochemically confirm the _LOCATION_ localization of _PROTEIN_ variants structures of n glycans attached to _PROTEIN_ polypeptides were analyzed using peptide n glycosidase f . pngase f cleaves n glycans that do not contain core fuc modification . since addition of core fucs occurs in the _LOCATION_ apparatus pngase f resistant n glycans can be _PROTEIN_ as a hallmark for successful delivery to _LOCATION_ stacks . in order to obtain _PROTEIN_ variants in sufficient quantity all constructs were transiently _PROTEIN_ in nicotiana benthamiana leaves . subcellular localization and immunoblot profiles of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ variants _PROTEIN_ in agroinfiltrated n. benthamiana leaf tissue were consistent with those _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis protoplasts . we found that _METHOD_ displayed a downward mobility shift after pngase f treatment . the lower mr form produced after pngase f digestion migrated similar to nonglycosylated _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ produced in the presence of tunicamycin . in contrast _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ hardly shifted at all . these findings establish that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ arrives in _LOCATION_ stacks where core fucosylation of its n glycan occurs but _METHOD_ decorated with two high man n glycans remains in the _LOCATION_ . taken together our in planta approaches unequivocally show that _PROTEIN_ is likely retained in the _LOCATION_ because of aberrant n glycosylation . prevention of aberrant n glycosylation of _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ polypeptides alleviated misfolding in the _LOCATION_ and enabled _LOCATION_ bound delivery to _LOCATION_ stacks . next we set out to determine whether this can explain the restoration of _PROTEIN_ function in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant . the ability of the n glycosylation variants of _PROTEIN_ to restore complex n glycan production in planta was analyzed by transient _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ constructs in _PROTEIN_ t mutant protoplasts . in addition the impact of _PROTEIN_ underglycosylation was assessed by _PROTEIN_ the same variants in _PROTEIN_ t _PROTEIN_ protoplasts . in principle all _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ variants _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ t _PROTEIN_ restored complex glycan formation within h on a fraction of proteins compared with mock transfected controls . the extent of recovery varied among constructs and correlated with _PROTEIN_ level of the _METHOD_ fusions . best recovery was observed with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ followed by nonglycosylated _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . these two protein fusions were clearly detectable with _METHOD_ antiserum . _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ showed delayed and less efficient recovery of complex glycosylation in the _PROTEIN_ t _PROTEIN_ background consistent with low abundance of the _METHOD_ fusions . in _PROTEIN_ t mutant protoplasts only _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ displayed _LOCATION_ labeling and produced complex modified glycoproteins . since all _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ variants were localized to the _LOCATION_ apparatus in _PROTEIN_ t _PROTEIN_ protoplasts we conclude that complementation depends upon delivery of correctly folded _PROTEIN_ variants to _LOCATION_ stacks . as already observed for col wild type and _PROTEIN_ mutant protoplasts _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ signals were hardly detectable in _PROTEIN_ t _PROTEIN_ protoplasts . this might be due to a generally reduced stability of aberrantly glycosylated polypeptides in protoplasts . nevertheless this demonstrates that minimal amounts of _PROTEIN_ protein are functional and can account for the recovery of complex glycosylation in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant lines . probably this can also explain why transgenic tobacco plants with less than _PROTEIN_ activity produce normal levels of complex glycans and indicates that low stainer plants obtained by an antisense approach in tobacco and potato are essentially devoid of _PROTEIN_ . none of the tested single or double mutants with n glycosylation defects displayed obvious growth phenotypes in soil . however differences in root growth were detected on vertical agar plates . the most striking morphological deviations were displayed by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ t _PROTEIN_ double mutants . root growth of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ seedlings resembled the wild type and single mutant parents which can be explained by suppression of the _PROTEIN_ defect in the _PROTEIN_ mutant background . close up images of root tips show that all _PROTEIN_ alleles produce longer root hairs compared with col wild type or _PROTEIN_ . in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ t _PROTEIN_ double mutants stunted growth of the root hair zone probably accounts for the bushy appearance . scanning electron microscopy images of root tips show that root hairs of the _PROTEIN_ t _PROTEIN_ double mutant are much thinner and longer than those of the col wild type . the latter _METHOD_ to be a feature of true loss of function _PROTEIN_ alleles since roots of _PROTEIN_ single and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutants grown in parallel have shorter hairs . together these findings point to _METHOD_ with expansion and probably also division of cells in the root elongation zone as a consequence of combining two basic n glycosylation defects _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . an obvious glycoprotein candidate known to affect root tip morphology when mutated in arabidopsis is _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ a class ii _LOCATION_ protein with eight predicted n glycosylation sites . the d _PROTEIN_ activity of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ to play crucial roles for cellulose biosynthesis at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and during cytokinesis . in accordance we observed altered _PROTEIN_ gel migration of _PROTEIN_ protein in _PROTEIN_ t _PROTEIN_ and mutants with other n glycosylation defects . in the past root hair phenotypes have been associated with defects in various secreted enzymes . among them is kojak a cellulose synthase like protein found in arabidopsis and rice glycoproteins affecting the synthesis of _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ components in arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . in this context it is noteworthy that the latter _METHOD_ to be indispensable for oriented root cell expansion .
