actin microfilaments participate in many fundamental processes in plant growth and development . here we report the co localization of the actin mf and _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ as visualized by vital vm staining with in living tobacco by cells stably _PROTEIN_ green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ fimbrin . the mfs were intensively localized on the vm surface and at the periphery of the cytoplasmic strands rather than at their center . the co localization of mfs and _METHOD_ was confirmed by the observation made using transient _PROTEIN_ of red _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ fimbrin in tobacco by cells stably _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and by cells stably _PROTEIN_ tonoplast intrinsic protein _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein . time lapse imaging revealed dynamic movement of mf structures which was parallel to that of cytoplasmic strands . disruption of mf structures disorganized cytoplasmic strand structures and produced small spherical _LOCATION_ in the vm accumulating region . three dimensional reconstructions of the _LOCATION_ structures revealed a disconnection of these small spherical _LOCATION_ from the large _LOCATION_ . real time observations and quantitative image analyses demonstrated rapid movements of mfs and _METHOD_ near the cell cortex which were inhibited by the general myosin _PROTEIN_ inhibitor butanedion monoxime . moreover both bistheonellide a and bdm treatment inhibited the reorganization of the cytoplasmic strands and the migration of daughter cell _LOCATION_ at early g phase suggesting a requirement for the acto myosin system for _LOCATION_ morphogenesis during cell cycle progression . these results suggest that mfs support the _LOCATION_ structures and that the acto myosin system plays an essential role in _LOCATION_ morphogenesis .
to visualize mf and vm structures simultaneously in living plant cells we used the tobacco by cell line and a stylyl dye that specifically labeled the vm . it was possible to do this in tobacco by cells in which the vm was labeled by _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ by the saponin permeabilizing method as reported previously . however because of the sensitivity of the mfs and _METHOD_ to saponin not all cells were suitable for observation by this staining method . in the living tobacco by cell line we could observe the mfs without saponin treatment . in addition the vm structures in the by cells could be visualized by without saponin treatment . using this vital vm staining technique in the by cells we succeeded in carrying out dual observations of the mfs and _METHOD_ in living cells without any adverse side effects . to examine in detail the spatial configuration of mfs and _METHOD_ we observed the dual visualized cells using confocal laser scanning microscopy _PROTEIN_ . in living by cells stained with we found that the mfs localized close to the cell cortex _LOCATION_ surface and along the cytoplasmic strands . the latter two localizations were confirmed by staining . an intensity profile across the _LOCATION_ surface and cell cortex showed that the mfs localized on the _LOCATION_ surface more intensively than close to the cell cortex . in the cytoplasmic strands mfs seemed to localize at the periphery of the strands rather than at the center of strands . an intensity profile across the cytoplasmic strands revealed the close localization of the mfs and _METHOD_ . to confirm the above co localization of mfs and _METHOD_ we transiently _PROTEIN_ red _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ fimbrin in tobacco by cells . the _METHOD_ of _METHOD_ fimbrin and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was localized close together on the cytoplasmic strands which was in agreement with that found using _METHOD_ fimbrin and . in addition we generated a transgenic tobacco by cell line that stably _PROTEIN_ tobacco tonoplast intrinsic protein _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . in arabidopsis _METHOD_ localized on the _METHOD_ and _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and is used as another marker of the vm . confocal images of our transgenic cell line named by gg _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ confirmed the co localization of the _METHOD_ and the mfs which were visualized by the transient _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ fimbrin . since the above dual localization suggested a role for mfs in cytoplasmic strand organization we performed a time sequential observation of the cytoplasmic strand movement . bright field observation showed a rapid movement of the cytoplasmic strands which was also reported in other _METHOD_ . according to the cytoplasmic strand movements _METHOD_ images of the _METHOD_ fimbrin revealed parallel movements of the mfs . in addition _METHOD_ spots of _METHOD_ fimbrin were moving on the surface of the large _LOCATION_ which was confirmed by bright field imaging . together with the co localization of mfs and _METHOD_ these observations implied the importance of the motility of the mfs for the _LOCATION_ movement . to confirm the relationship between mf and vm structures in the cytoplasmic strands we examined the effect of ba an inhibitor of actin polymerization . the cytoplasmic strands which ran through the large _LOCATION_ were evident before ba addition . after ba application the mfs and cytoplasmic strands gradually began to shrink synchronously and completely disappeared min after ba addition . after the disruption of the strands the small spherical _LOCATION_ appeared from the region in which vm accumulated . the disruption of the strands and the appearance of the small spherical _LOCATION_ were also observed in both by gg cells and by cells . three dimensional reconstructions of the _LOCATION_ structures from serial images obtained by _PROTEIN_ using reant software demonstrated that these small spherical _LOCATION_ were disconnected from the large _LOCATION_ . to confirm these phenomena observed by the above time lapse imaging statistically we counted cells with cytoplasmic strands or small spherical _LOCATION_ . upon ba treatment most of the cytoplasmic strands disappeared while an inhibitor of microtubule organization propyzamide had almost no effect . ba treatment also produced small spherical _LOCATION_ in > of the cells but these structures were never observed in the control and propyzamide treated cells . similar effects were observed by treatment with cd another inhibitor of actin polymerization . since mfs seemed to be involved in the active movement of the cytoplasmic strands we next focused on the movement of the mf arrays near the cell cortex . projection of time sequential images taken every s showed dynamic movements of mfs near the cell cortex . in particular some mfs were constantly swinging . to examine the role of myosin on the movement of mfs we treated cells with the general myosin _PROTEIN_ inhibitor butanedion monoxime . treatment of by cells with mm bdm for min _PROTEIN_ the structure of mfs but completely blocked their movements . in addition cytoplasmic streaming was completely stopped . when we quantified the mf movement using a correlation coefficient as an indicator of the alteration of images bdm treatment clearly inhibited the mf movement . like the mf movements when we monitored vm movement in tobacco by cells the surface of the large _LOCATION_ was found to be constantly moving . this movement was inhibited by both ba and bdm treatment but ba treatment additionally produced small spherical _LOCATION_ whereas bdm treatment did not change the vm structure essentially . similar effects were observed in by cells stained with . in earlier studies we reported the dynamic changes in _LOCATION_ structures during cell cycle progression . in mitosis most of the cytoplasmic strands disappeared but became reorganized at early g phase . to examine the role of mfs in _LOCATION_ dynamics during cell cycle progression we observed synchronized by cells stained with in particular from telophase to early g phase . at _PROTEIN_ telophase very few mfs were observed in intravacuolar sheets but the mfs started to elongate along the intravacuolar sheets during the migration of the daughter _LOCATION_ in early g phase . finally cytoplasmic strands with intensive mf localization could be recognized . to investigate the involvement of acto myosin in the formation of the cytoplasmic strands ba or bdm was applied at _PROTEIN_ telophase . reorganization of cytoplasmic strands was not observed and migration of daughter _LOCATION_ was completely inhibited . in this stage of the cell cycle bundle like mf structures were accumulated near the cell surface and immediately below the mf bundle a vm structure was observed . three dimensional reconstructions of the _LOCATION_ clearly showed the groove like structure of the vm at early g phase . if these vm structures are an origin of the cytoplasmic strands the mf structures may be involved in the origination of the cytoplasmic strands in addition to their elongation and _PROTEIN_ .
