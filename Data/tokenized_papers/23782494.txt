the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ bax protein is one of a few cell death suppressors known to be conserved in animals and plants . the function of proteins in response to various biotic and abiotic stress _PROTEIN_ is well established . however little is known about the underlying _METHOD_ . we conducted experiments to identify arabidopsis thaliana proteins to obtain a potentially better understanding of how functions during plant pathogen interactions and as a suppressor of cell death . liquid chromatography and tandem _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ identified proteins with green fluorescing protein _METHOD_ . five selected candidate proteins a ribophorin ii _PROTEIN_ family protein _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ synthase _PROTEIN_ a cytochrome _PROTEIN_ h _PROTEIN_ and prohibitin _PROTEIN_ were further investigated with _PROTEIN_ to their role in processes . to this end we analysed a set of arabidopsis mutants in the interaction with the _PROTEIN_ powdery mildew fungus _LOCATION_ cruciferarum and on cell treatments . two independent _PROTEIN_ mutants tended to better support powdery mildew and a _PROTEIN_ mutant showed altered responses to cell alternaria alternata f.sp . lycopersici toxin treatment . two independent _PROTEIN_ mutants showed a strong powdery mildew resistance phenotype and enhanced sensitivity to aal toxin . moreover studies and _METHOD_ resonance energy transfer experiments suggested a direct interaction of with _PROTEIN_ at the _LOCATION_ .
in order to identify interaction partners of arabidopsis was performed using _METHOD_ arabidopsis mutants . empty vector _PROTEIN_ mutants served as control plants . both arabidopsis mutants were either noninoculated or inoculated with _PROTEIN_ e. cruciferarum and nonadapted b. graminis f.sp . hordei respectively . the total protein input for was extracted from a pool of all variants in order to gain as many putative proteins as possible . _METHOD_ and putative interaction partners were using _METHOD_ agarose beads and identified by liquid chromatography and tandem _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ in conjunction with database searching against the viridiplantae subset of the national center for biotechnology information database . a total of proteins was identified in the _METHOD_ sample of which were not present in the empty vector control sample . table lists these _METHOD_ proteins . cowling and birnboim showed that human can be resistant to trypsin proteolysis . this might explain the detection of only one peptide _PROTEIN_ . however western blots against _METHOD_ showed a successful precipitation of _METHOD_ and mascot database search against the whole ncbi database revealed an enrichment of _METHOD_ peptides in the _METHOD_ again validating a successful precipitation of _METHOD_ . for first examinations five putatively _LOCATION_ candidates were selected predominantly according to their presumed function and predicted subcellular localization ribophorin ii _PROTEIN_ family protein _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ synthase _PROTEIN_ a cytochrome _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ h _PROTEIN_ and prohibitin _PROTEIN_ . candidates were selected after a quality check of the respective _METHOD_ spectra by manual inspection although not all identified peptides showed significant mascot ion scores . the five selected putative proteins are listed in table including information about the arabidopsis genome initiative _PROTEIN_ code the amino acid sequence of the identified peptides the mascot ion score and the assumed subcellular localization according to the arabidopsis information resource annotation . was repeated twice . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ with _METHOD_ in all three independent experiments . _PROTEIN_ was identified in two independent repetitions . according to tair _PROTEIN_ is predicted to have glycotransferase activity as part of the oligosaccharyltransferase complex catalysing the of proteins in the _LOCATION_ . correct is critical for the prevention of _LOCATION_ stress and watanabe and lam have shown a role of in the suppression of _LOCATION_ stress . this might functionally link and _PROTEIN_ . can function in the network and play essential roles in stress responses . therefore we chose the _METHOD_ as a candidate protein . recently keinath et al . have shown that the _PROTEIN_ mutant open stomata is affected in immune signalling triggered by the perception of molecular patterns _PROTEIN_ . in barley _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ h have been suggested to be involved in resistance to b. graminis f.sp . hordei . however the identified peptide is also part of _PROTEIN_ . another interesting candidate is _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ are involved in the prevention of stress responses and seem to play a major role in cell mitochondrial function . in human cells apparently regulates cell death by interaction with a homologue of _PROTEIN_ which we found to with _METHOD_ . interestingly a search of the human sequence against the a. thaliana database of ncbi identified _PROTEIN_ as the best hit . therefore and because monooxygenases are often associated with _LOCATION_ we included _PROTEIN_ in further investigations . to analyse the function of candidate proteins in a plant pathogen interaction we conducted an assay using arabidopsis mutants predicted to be deficient in the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or which we inoculated with the _PROTEIN_ powdery mildew fungus e. cruciferarum . we did not observe _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in the two independent _PROTEIN_ mutants _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ using reverse chain reaction . however in _PROTEIN_ the insertion is in the promoter region bp upstream of the open reading frame . therefore we can not exclude a residual _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in this mutant . microscopic analyses showed a slightly but not significantly increased fungal development on both _PROTEIN_ mutants days after inoculation measured as the number of conidiophores per colony . on the the fungus developed an average number of about c/c whereas the conidiophore production was enhanced to c/c and c/c on _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ respectively . at the macroscopic level we did not observe obvious differences in symptom development on leaves of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ when compared with . as _PROTEIN_ loss of function hampers the growth of the pollen tube into the style only heterozygous _PROTEIN_ mutants can be obtained . both heterozygous _PROTEIN_ mutants _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ at a clearly reduced level when compared with the . for the mutant _PROTEIN_ we can not exclude an influence on the _PROTEIN_ of as the insertion is located in the common promoter region of _PROTEIN_ and . both _PROTEIN_ mutants were similar in that they supported a slightly increased fungal development when compared with the . the fungus developed c/c on . on _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ e. cruciferarum developed c/c and c/c respectively . this effect was statistically significant for _PROTEIN_ . at _PROTEIN_ points in time leaves of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ seemed to be only slightly more infected by powdery mildew than the as assessed with the naked eye . the insertion mutant _PROTEIN_ did not _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and the point mutant _PROTEIN_ previously described as _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ a reduced amount of the mutant transcript . the _PROTEIN_ mutants stood out as a result of a dramatically reduced susceptibility to powdery mildew which was readily visible with the naked eye . concomitantly the number of c/c was _PROTEIN_ strongly on both _PROTEIN_ mutants compared with the at dai . _LOCATION_ cruciferarum developed an average of c/c on and only c/c and c/c on _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ respectively . hemm et al . demonstrated a reduced level of aliphatic glycosinolates and a slightly increased level of _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . to investigate a influence on the _PROTEIN_ composition we measured the content of several _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ and leaves at dai with e. cruciferarum and in noninoculated control leaves . in noninoculated plants the content of aliphatic _PROTEIN_ was reduced in _PROTEIN_ relative to plants as described for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . however under the conditions used we observed only a marginally enhanced amount of _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ . a influence on the _PROTEIN_ content was hardly detectable . a tendency for induction by e. cruciferarum could be seen for at dai in both genotypes . insertion lines and an _PROTEIN_ insertion line seemed to be as strongly infected by e. cruciferarum as and were not further analysed in detail . overall at least two of the five investigated candidate proteins appeared to have functions in the arabidopsis e. cruciferarum interaction . although _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ to limit fungal development _PROTEIN_ is required for the susceptibility of arabidopsis plants to e. cruciferarum . to assess whether _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ might be involved in cell death suppression _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were treated with alternaria alternata f.sp . lycopersici toxin to induce cell death . the mutant _PROTEIN_ which showed enhanced sensitivity to the fungal toxin _PROTEIN_ and to heat stress relative to plants was included as a positive control . cell death _METHOD_ were evaluated days after aal toxin application . when compared with aal lesions were larger on _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . there was no altered sensitivity to aal toxin application of _PROTEIN_ mutant plants relative to . control leaves treated with distilled water showed no cell death reactions at all . thus mutations of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ also apparently alter arabidopsis cell death responses . in a single experiment seedlings of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ also showed stronger cell death phenotypes after heat shock relative to . _PROTEIN_ was slightly less affected after exposure to heat shock when compared with or _PROTEIN_ . next we performed studies of _METHOD_ with red fluorescing protein _METHOD_ or versions of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ in transiently transformed nicotiana tabacum cv . _METHOD_ leaf segments . as already shown by et al . _METHOD_ localized in the _LOCATION_ and in the _LOCATION_ envelope . in control cells soluble _METHOD_ served as a marker with localization in the cytoplasm and in the _LOCATION_ . like mammalian prohibitins arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ is thought to be associated with mitochondria . we confirmed the localization of _PROTEIN_ to mitochondria by the transient _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ in the marker line . as shown in fig . _METHOD_ accumulated in mitochondria all over the cell . of _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ was visible in small dots which presumably represent contact points of mitochondria with the _LOCATION_ and the _LOCATION_ envelope . we observed the same localization pattern after the transient transformation of arabidopsis epidermal cells via particle bombardment . cytochrome proteins typically reside in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . as _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ synthesize aliphatic aldoximes which are substrates of _PROTEIN_ at the _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ is also suggested to be present in this compartment . _PROTEIN_ as a glycotransferase is also predicted to be present in the _LOCATION_ where takes place . as predicted _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ fusion proteins accumulated in the _LOCATION_ and around the _LOCATION_ in transiently transformed tobacco epidermal cells . soluble _METHOD_ served as a marker for _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ localization . of _METHOD_ with either _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ resulted in overlapping _METHOD_ signals confirming the accumulation of both putative proteins in the _LOCATION_ and around the _LOCATION_ . comparative quantitative profiling of the _METHOD_ intensities of _METHOD_ and either _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ further supported their . the same localization patterns were observed in transiently transformed arabidopsis epidermal cells after particle bombardment but the _METHOD_ intensities were very low . hence _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ showed essential with which supports the possibility of a physical protein protein interaction . _PROTEIN_ mutants showed strong phenotypes in the interaction with e. cruciferarum and in cell death regulation . to test for a direct interaction between and _PROTEIN_ at the _LOCATION_ we conducted _METHOD_ resonance energy transfer measurements by acceptor photobleaching using transiently transformed arabidopsis epidermal cells . we chemically fixed the transformed leaves before the fret experiment because rapid movement of the _LOCATION_ in living cells otherwise provoked artefacts after photobleaching of _PROTEIN_ at a segment of the _LOCATION_ envelope . in four independent experiments we observed a significantly enhanced fret efficiency in cells _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ relative to control cells _PROTEIN_ an _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ together with _PROTEIN_ . and fret experiments thus suggest direct interaction of and _PROTEIN_ at the _LOCATION_ .
