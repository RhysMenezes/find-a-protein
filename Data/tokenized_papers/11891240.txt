transcription _PROTEIN_ are required for the progression and arrest of the cell cycle in animals . like animals plants have evolved to conserve the family . the arabidopsis genome encodes and dp proteins that share a high similarity with the animal and dp families . here we show that arabidopsis and dp proteins are not predominantly localized to the _LOCATION_ in analyses with green _METHOD_ protein and that the complete _LOCATION_ localization of some members is driven by the co _PROTEIN_ of their specific partner proteins . both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were translocated to the _LOCATION_ and transactivate an reporter gene when co _PROTEIN_ with dpa but not dpb . in contrast _PROTEIN_ was inactive for both _LOCATION_ translocation and transactivation even when dpa or dpb was co _PROTEIN_ . because the dna binding activities of the three are equally stimulated by the interaction with dpa or dpb in vitro the observed transactivation of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ is dpa specific and _LOCATION_ import dependent . a green _METHOD_ protein fusion with an _PROTEIN_ mutant in which a conserved _LOCATION_ export signal like sequence in the dimerization domain was deleted was localized to the _LOCATION_ . thus the concomitant _LOCATION_ translocation _METHOD_ to be conferred by the dpa interaction to release an activity that inhibits an intrinsic _LOCATION_ import activity of _PROTEIN_ . furthermore the _LOCATION_ translocation of _PROTEIN_ stimulated by dpa was abolished by the deletion of the n terminal region of _PROTEIN_ which is conserved among all the proteins identified in plants to date . replacement of the n terminal region of _PROTEIN_ with a canonical _LOCATION_ localization signal only partially mimicked the effect of the dpa co _PROTEIN_ demonstrating the function of plant distinct from that observed for animal . these observations suggest that the function of plant and dp proteins is primarily controlled by their _LOCATION_ localization mediated by the interaction with specific partner proteins .
we isolated three _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and two dp cdnas from arabidopsis by reverse transcriptase pcr based on the sequence information in databases and their deduced amino acid sequences were identical to those from cdnas registered in the databases except for _PROTEIN_ . it seemed that all the cdnas contain the complete open reading frames judging from the cdna sequences including the untranslated region in the database and the mrna length estimated from our northern analyses . to avoid confusion about designations for the three or other animal we have referred to _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ as _PROTEIN_ as _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ as _PROTEIN_ respectively . the dna binding ability of _PROTEIN_ and dps was tested by electrophoretic mobility shift assay _METHOD_ with the dna probe containing an binding site in a tobacco proliferating cell _LOCATION_ antigen promoter . in vitro translated _PROTEIN_ or dps alone did not bind to the probe dna although a high concentration of the recombinant thioredoxin fusion proteins with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or dpa did . in contrast the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ product cotranslated with dpa or dpb exhibited dna binding with a high affinity indicating an increase in the dna binding activity by the interaction of _PROTEIN_ with dps . we further measured the strength of the interaction of each with dpa or dpb by the yeast two hybrid assay . although in the dna binding assay _PROTEIN_ exhibited no differential increase in dna binding between the complex with dpa and dpb the yeast assay revealed a differential specificity in the dimerization affinity . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ interacted more preferentially with dpa than with dpb whereas _PROTEIN_ did better with dpb . to determine the transactivational activity dependent on the interaction of _PROTEIN_ and dps we carried out cotransfection assays with an reporter gene luc which contains four copies of the binding site in the tobacco proliferating cell _LOCATION_ antigen promoter by microprojectile bombardment of suspension cultured tobacco cells . when the reporter plasmid was cotransfected with either _PROTEIN_ plasmid containing the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ dpa or dpb cdna under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus promoter to tobacco cells no significant activation of the reporter gene was observed . for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ only a and fold activation was found respectively compared with the control with the reporter plasmid alone . when the _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ plasmid was transfected with the dpa plasmid activation of the reporter gene was increased about and fold respectively . the average increase in activation for _PROTEIN_ based on data from independent experiments was fold with ansd of fold . the fluctuation of the transactivation ratio is dependent on the growth state of the cells used more actively dividing cells tended to have a higher background level of reporter gene activity leading to a low activation ratio . the increase in the luc activity caused by these _PROTEIN_ was dependent on the sites in the reporter gene because a mutant reporter gene luc was activated only at low level when cotransfected with the _PROTEIN_ and dpa plasmids . although the mutant site did not bind both the cotranslation product of _PROTEIN_ and the recombinant _PROTEIN_ proteins the weak transactivation observed for the mutant reporter gene may be because of an increased binding activity of the multimerized mutant site or some weak binding sites present in the vector or the core promoter sequences . cotransfection with the dpb in contrast to dpa plasmid led to only about a fold activation for _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ . furthermore unlike _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ had only a minor effect on the transactivational activity even when co _PROTEIN_ with dpa or dpb . these observations indicate distinct functions in transactivation of the arabidopsis and dp members . we then tested whether the weak transactivational activity of _PROTEIN_ is because of the transcriptional activation domain . in yeast the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ which were fused with the dna binding domain resulted in a significant activation of the galactosidase reporter gene whereas that of _PROTEIN_ had no effect . this is consistent with the transactivational properties of these proteins in tobacco cells as shown in figure . in the animal the transcriptional activation domains are located in the c terminal region . the truncated form of _PROTEIN_ which lacked the c terminal region corresponding to the animal transactivation domain had no transactivational activity when cotransfected with dpa in tobacco cells indicating the presence of the transcriptional activation domain in the c terminus as well as the animal . the corresponding c terminal region of _PROTEIN_ was translationally fused with and the resulting construct was tested for transactivation . the reporter gene activation of mediated by the co _PROTEIN_ of dpa in the tobacco cells was lowered to about one third of the wild type _PROTEIN_ and had no transactivational activity in yeast . these observations indicate that the low efficiency for the reporter gene activation of _PROTEIN_ is partly attributable to a weak activity of the transcriptional activation domain . although the transactivation domain of _PROTEIN_ appeared to be considerably weaker than that of _PROTEIN_ retained a moderate level of transactivational activity in plant cells suggesting that the strength of the transactivation domain of _PROTEIN_ alone does not reflect the activity for transactivation . we suspected that the transactivation effect observed for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and includes an effect because of sequestration of rb species that interact with endogenous proteins to repress the reporter gene rather than a direct transactivation effect through the activation domain of _PROTEIN_ . to test this possibility we used an _PROTEIN_ construct for the c terminal region of _PROTEIN_ containing a potential rb binding domain fused with nls the nls from simian virus large t antigen . when was _PROTEIN_ with the reporter gene however less activation of the reporter gene was observed indicating that the activation is a direct effect of transactivation by overexpressed and dp proteins . although both dpa and dpb efficiently stimulated the dna binding activity of _PROTEIN_ only dpa mediated a high level of transactivation . thus it was expected that there is another mechanism controlling the transactivation of the complex besides the regulation of dna binding activity . the subcellular distribution of _PROTEIN_ and dps was examined using proteins fused with the green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ . we first confirmed that _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ dpa had a transactivation potential similar to their native proteins when they were co _PROTEIN_ with the corresponding partner proteins in the cultured tobacco cells . it seemed that the addition of the _METHOD_ tag rather increased the transactivation efficiency probably because of an efficient translation initiation or increased protein stability of the _METHOD_ fusions . observation of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ using an _METHOD_ microscope revealed that the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ dps proteins were localized to the cytoplasm or both the cytoplasm and _LOCATION_ . in about and of the cells _PROTEIN_ gf and gf respectively the _METHOD_ signals were observed _PROTEIN_ in the cytoplasm . when we used a _METHOD_ fusion protein fused at the c terminus of _PROTEIN_ to generate _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ a similar pattern of the subcellular distribution was observed indicating that the intracellular movement of _PROTEIN_ is less affected by the fusion of _METHOD_ . in contrast gf was observed in both the _LOCATION_ and cytoplasm in a majority of the cells which would reflect the higher transactivational activity on _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ relative to the other two as shown in figure . we then examined the change in the subcellular localization of the gf and proteins by cotransfection with the dpa or dpb plasmid . the co _PROTEIN_ of the dpa protein effectively induced exclusive _LOCATION_ localization of gf and gf but not gf whereas the dpb protein did not significantly affect the localization . these results were confirmed by a reciprocal exchange through the addition of the _METHOD_ tag to dpa and dpb . the _LOCATION_ translocation of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mediated by dpa was highly correlated with the strong transactivational activities of these combinations . this concomitant _LOCATION_ localization process _METHOD_ to be mediated by a novel mechanism because neither _PROTEIN_ nor dps were _LOCATION_ . moreover we wondered whether this process involves a recruitment of other cellular _PROTEIN_ such as nls containing _PROTEIN_ or protein kinases that have been stimulated in actively dividing cells . however when we used cultured tobacco cells incubated with a hormone free medium as semiquiescent cells the _LOCATION_ localization of gf and gf mediated by dpa occurred at an efficiency similar to that in the actively dividing tobacco cells . we then examined whether the _LOCATION_ translocation of _PROTEIN_ involves their direct interaction using a _METHOD_ fusion with a dimerization domain mutant of _PROTEIN_ in which amino acid residues of the dimerization domain were deleted . it was unexpected that gf was localized to the _LOCATION_ by itself and the efficiency of the _LOCATION_ localization was not affected by the co _PROTEIN_ of dpa . these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ has an autonomous nls and that the dimerization domain of _PROTEIN_ contains a _LOCATION_ export signal or a sequence that inhibits the _LOCATION_ localization which may be masked by the binding of dpa to release the inhibition of the _LOCATION_ localization . subcellular localization of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and dp a plant proteins isolated to date and the mammalian share a conserved region containing three consecutive basic amino acids in their n terminal end . to evaluate the role of the conserved region in the _LOCATION_ localization mediated by the interaction with dpa we constructed an _PROTEIN_ mutant in which the n terminal amino acids of _PROTEIN_ were deleted . no _LOCATION_ localization of the _METHOD_ fusion protein was observed even when dpa was co _PROTEIN_ . this mutant protein was localized _PROTEIN_ in the cytoplasm in a greater number of cells than the wild type _PROTEIN_ . the loss of the _LOCATION_ localization activity was only partly complemented by the fusion of nls to the n terminus when the construct was co _PROTEIN_ with dpa but not dpb . the _LOCATION_ localization activities of these mutants were well correlated with the transactivational activity . moreover we examined the autonomous nls function of the n terminal sequence of _PROTEIN_ by fusing the sequence to the c terminus of _METHOD_ . the gf construct however did not exhibit an exclusive _LOCATION_ localization of the _METHOD_ protein similar to the original _METHOD_ protein indicating that the n terminal basic region has no nls activity by itself . _PROTEIN_ contains an n terminal basic region with a structure slightly different from those of other plant which is a possible cause of the deficiency in the _LOCATION_ localization activity of _PROTEIN_ . thus we replaced the n terminal region consisting of amino acids of _PROTEIN_ with the sequence of _PROTEIN_ to generate and fused it with _METHOD_ . this fusion protein did not exhibit an exclusive _LOCATION_ localization even when co _PROTEIN_ with dpa or dpb suggesting that the n terminal conserved sequence is important but not sufficient for mediation of the _LOCATION_ localization of plant .
