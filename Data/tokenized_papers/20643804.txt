mature pollen is very sensitive to cold stress in _PROTEIN_ sensitive plants . plant wrky dna binding transcription _PROTEIN_ are key regulators in plant responses to abiotic and biotic stresses . previous studies have suggested that _PROTEIN_ gene might be involved in pollen viability although the mechanism involved is unclear . in this study it is shown that cold treatment increased _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in the wild type and promoter gus analysis revealed that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is pollen specific . enhanced green _METHOD_ protein tagged _PROTEIN_ was localized in the _LOCATION_ . pollen harbouring the _PROTEIN_ allele showed higher viability than pollen with the _PROTEIN_ allele after cold treatment . further functional analysis indicated that the _PROTEIN_ transcription _PROTEIN_ was involved in pollen development regulated by the pollen specific mikc class of mads domain transcription _PROTEIN_ under cold stress and cold insensitivity of mature _PROTEIN_ pollen might be partly attributable to the enhanced _PROTEIN_ of transcriptional activator cbfs in the mutants . thus the _PROTEIN_ transcription _PROTEIN_ negatively mediated cold sensitivity of mature arabidopsis pollen and might be involved in the cbf signal cascade in mature pollen .
in total plants were analysed for gus activity in inflorescences bud clusters and flowers . in plants gus activity was only detected in the male gametophyte and was observed in mature pollen grains from flowers at stage . in seedlings of lines of plants for each line no gus _PROTEIN_ was observed in seedlings leaves roots and stamen vascular tissue . measurement of _PROTEIN_ mrnas in wt plant organs by quantitative rt pcr showed that _PROTEIN_ mrnas were strongly detected in male gametophytic tissues and barely detected in seedling leaves petioles _METHOD_ and roots . _PROTEIN_ patterns

showed no distinct change in the _PROTEIN_ mutants . _LOCATION_ bars indicate standard deviations of three independent biological samples . differences between the untreated and treated plants with cold stress are significant at p < . as shown in the _METHOD_ signal of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ construct was detected in the _LOCATION_ of the nicotiana benthamiana cells . quantitative rt pcr revealed that _PROTEIN_ transcription in mature pollen increased by more than fold after h or h cold stress compared to the control . characterization of two homozygous _PROTEIN_ mutants is shown in . mature pollen of the _PROTEIN_ mutant which contained t dna at the second exon produced no _PROTEIN_ transcripts in contrast to the wt . in the _PROTEIN_ mutant which contained t dna at position relative to the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in mature pollen was significantly reduced . _PROTEIN_ transcripts were also detected in the _PROTEIN_ mutants after cold treatment and the level of _PROTEIN_ transcripts for both mutants did not change distinctly in response to cold stress . the _PROTEIN_ mutant lines were sensitive to kanamycin since it harboured the t dna which necessitated pcr based analyses of the genotypes . no morphological abnormalities were observed in the _PROTEIN_ mutants after growth at . characterization of _PROTEIN_ and wrky mutants and developmental stage of the inflorescence at the time of cold treatment . exon and intron structure of the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ gene showing the locations of the t dna insertion sites in both mutants . boxes indicate exons . relative _PROTEIN_ rna _PROTEIN_ in mature pollen of the _PROTEIN_ mutants . _LOCATION_ bars indicate standard deviations of three independent determinations . three independent experiments were shown by re extracting rna from other samples . each experiment was also executed three times . flowers at stage at the time of cold treatment are numbered flowers at more advanced stages are indicated by negative numbers . the ratio of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ genotypes to _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ genotypes in the progeny from greenhouse grown _PROTEIN_ heterozygous mutants was accorded with a predicted ratio of _PROTEIN_ . for progeny from the cold treated heterozygous mutant plants the to ratio for both lines differed significantly from . the ratios of to plants were and for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ respectively after h cold treatment divergence from the was even greater after h cold treatment _PROTEIN_ . thus among the progeny plants harbouring a _PROTEIN_ allele were significantly more frequent than plants harbouring a _PROTEIN_ allele which indicated that differential gametophytic viability existed after exposure to cold stress . segregation analysis of progeny of self fertilized heterozygous _PROTEIN_ plants with cold treatment the inheritance of _PROTEIN_ was analysed using pcr based genotyping . is the number of plants containing the _PROTEIN_ allele _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is the the number of plants containing the _PROTEIN_ allele _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ ratio is . the test was used to compare the observed ratios with a predicted ratio of . the untreated greenhouse grown plants were used as the control . when the _PROTEIN_ heterozygote with or without cold treatment was used as the maternal parent in reciprocal crosses between untreated wt and cold treated heterozygous plants the ratios for wt and heterozygous plants did not differ significantly from _PROTEIN_ . these results indicated that the _PROTEIN_ mutation did not affect female gametophytic viability . when the _PROTEIN_ heterozygote without cold treatment was the paternal parent the ratios also accorded with indicating that the _PROTEIN_ mutation did not affect male gametophytic viability in the absence of cold treatment . analysis of the genetic transmission of _PROTEIN_ after cold treatment the inheritance of _PROTEIN_ was analysed by genotyping the progeny of the specified crosses . ratio is the observed wild type to heterozygous frequencies . the wt parental plants were grown at without cold treatment . the test was used to compare the observed ratios with a predicted ratio of . the untreated greenhouse grown parental plants were used as the control . by contrast when the _PROTEIN_ heterozygote with cold treatment was the paternal parent the ratios of wt and heterozygous plants in the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ progeny populations were and respectively and differed significantly from _PROTEIN_ . thus male gametophytes with a _PROTEIN_ allele exhibited greater competitive ability than gametophytes with a _PROTEIN_ allele after cold treatment . without cold treatment nearly all of the mature pollen from homozygous wt and _PROTEIN_ plants exhibited green _METHOD_ after staining with _PROTEIN_ . after cold treatment the percentage of viable pollen grains from both mutants was distinctly higher than that of wt . after h cold treatment the percentage of viable pollen grains was and in wt _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ plants respectively . mature pollen viability and seed set of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ plants compared with the wild type after cold treatment . the percentage of viable pollen grains determined by staining with fluorescein diacetate . in each replicate over pollen grains were counted . percentage pollen germination in vivo . in each replicate more than pollen grains were counted . average number of elongated pollen tubes per stigma from self fertilized plants . in each replicate more than stigmas were counted . germinated pollen in vivo stained with aniline blue . after cold treatment elongated pollen tubes on the stigma were more frequent in the _PROTEIN_ mutants than the wt . seed set by flowers cold treated at stage and subsequently transferred to normal growing conditions until seeds had matured . the number of seeds per silique was counted . representative examples of seed set within mature siliques from cold stressed wild type and _PROTEIN_ plants . because the seed production difference between the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ was slight a representative example of _PROTEIN_ seed sets was used to present the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . _LOCATION_ bars indicate standard deviations of three replicate experiments . in each replicate over siliques were sampled . differences between the wt and _PROTEIN_ mutants after cold stress were significant at p < or p < . the untreated greenhouse grown plants were used as the control . without cold stress the percentage pollen germination for the _PROTEIN_ mutants was indistinguishable from that of wt pollen at min after artificial pollination . after h cold treatment the percentage of germinated pollen grains was higher in the mutants than in the wt and in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ respectively compared with in the wt . with h cold stress the difference between the _PROTEIN_ mutants and wt was enhanced . at h after self pollination the number of elongated pollen tubes per stigma did not differ significantly between the wt and _PROTEIN_ mutants in the absence of cold treatment . after cold treatment the number of elongated pollen tubes per stigma in the _PROTEIN_ mutants was considerably higher than that of the wt . with h cold treatment the number of elongated pollen tubes per stigma was and in the wt _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ plants respectively . these data indicate that cold stress did not completely abolish pollen germination or pollen tube elongation but more severely inhibited these processes in the wt than in the _PROTEIN_ mutants . the average seed number per silique in all unstressed plants was about . the seed number was severely reduced in wt plants but only slightly reduced in _PROTEIN_ plants treated at for h . with h cold stress the average seed number per silique was and for the wt _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ respectively . in the mature siliques of _PROTEIN_ plants exposed to cold stress the gaps in the silique were fewer than those in the wt . moreover when unstressed wt pollen was crossed onto cold stressed stigmas of wt and _PROTEIN_ mutant plants no differences in seed set were recorded . this indicated that reduced fertility of the plants was primarily due to defective pollen and that cold stress more strongly affected pollen of the wt than the _PROTEIN_ mutant . although exposure of mature pollen to cold stress resulted in reduced seed set the seed set of _PROTEIN_ mutants was significantly higher than that of the wt which indirectly indicated that the mature pollen of homozygous _PROTEIN_ mutants is less sensitive to cold stress . it also showed that even without competing pollen _PROTEIN_ mutant pollen was more tolerant to cold stress and had a greater chance of achieving successful fertilization than wt pollen after cold treatment . most of the transgenic lines showing a high level of _PROTEIN_ transcription were almost sterile . two of these lines were selected to elucidate whether reduction in male gametophytic fertility caused the sterility . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ plants was detected using quantitative rt pcr with gene specific primers . in mature pollen the levels of _PROTEIN_ transcripts in the transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were fold and fold higher than that in vector transgenic plants respectively and both transformants were almost sterile . scanning electron microscopic examination of the pollen surface and staining of the _LOCATION_ of mature pollen did not reveal obvious differences compared to that of the vector control . phenotype of _PROTEIN_ compared with the vector transgenic plant . inflorescence of a vector transgenic _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ plants under normal growing conditions . relative _PROTEIN_ rna _PROTEIN_ levels in mature pollen of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ plants . _METHOD_ of mature pollen grains from vector transgenic plant _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ plants stained with fluoroscein diacetate _PROTEIN_ . the proportion of viable pollen grains as determined by staining with _PROTEIN_ . elongated pollen tubes from vector transgenic _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ plants stained with aniline blue . average number of elongated pollen tubes per stigma of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ plants . _LOCATION_ bars indicate standard deviations of three independent biological samples . pollen viability and pollen tube growth of the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ plants were examined using the vector transgenic plants as the control . less than of the pollen grains was viable and only a few pollen tubes elongated on the stigma of _PROTEIN_ plants . male and female fertility of _PROTEIN_ plants were also investigated by performing reciprocal crosses between homozygous and vector transgenic plants . in vector transgenic plants pollinated by mature pollen of _PROTEIN_ and self fertilized _PROTEIN_ plants the fertilization aborted . by contrast fertilization was successful when the pistil of _PROTEIN_ was pollinated with mature pollen of the vector transgenic plant . these results indicated that the sterility of _PROTEIN_ plants was caused by defective pollen . thus over _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in mature pollen of transgenic plants greatly reduced fertility . in the absence of cold stress _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants did not differ significantly from that of the wt . after cold treatment the level of _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ was and times respectively that in the wt . on the other hand cold treatment led to a and fold increase in accumulation of _PROTEIN_ in the wt _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ respectively . thus mutation of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ enhanced the cold induced _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ . previous studies have shown that mikc proteins exhibit functional redundancy and a single mikc mutation does not significantly affect their function . this might explain why _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ showed no obvious difference from the wt without cold treatment . _PROTEIN_ rna _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants . _PROTEIN_ rna _PROTEIN_ was determined in rna extracted from mature pollen after treatment . _LOCATION_ bars indicate standard deviations of determinations from three independent rna extracts . differences between the wild type and _PROTEIN_ mutants after cold treatment were significant at p < or p < .the untreated greenhouse grown plants were used as the control . in untreated wt and _PROTEIN_ mutant plants the levels of mikc transcripts showed no significant difference between the wt and _PROTEIN_ mutants . after cold treatment _PROTEIN_ of these genes _PROTEIN_ considerably in both the wt and _PROTEIN_ mutants . cold treatment strongly reduced accumulation of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ transcripts in all plants and the accumulation of transcripts of each gene in cold treated _PROTEIN_ mutants did not differ significantly from that in the wt . in addition _PROTEIN_ of the five mikc genes in _PROTEIN_ transgenic plants did not differ significantly from that of vector transgenic plants . thus the _PROTEIN_ of mikc genes was independent of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . rna levels of mikc genes in mature pollen of _PROTEIN_ mutants and wild type plants . mikc rna _PROTEIN_ was determined in rna extracted from mature pollen after treatment with for h or h. _LOCATION_ bars indicate standard deviations from three independent rna extracts . differences between the untreated and cold stressed plants were significant at p < . without cold treatment _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ increased about fold in _PROTEIN_ mutants relative to that in the wt . quantitative rt pcr revealed that cbfs transcription was induced by cold treatment in _PROTEIN_ mutants and reached a maximum level after about h of cold stress and thereafter began to _PROTEIN_ slightly . cbf transcription in mature pollen of the wt was not induced by cold treatment when compared to _PROTEIN_ mutants . in mature pollen of _PROTEIN_ mutants h cold treatment led to a fold increase in the accumulation of _PROTEIN_ transcripts and a fold increase in the accumulation of _PROTEIN_ transcripts which was consistent with microarray analysis _PROTEIN_ . in addition five _PROTEIN_ genes which are target genes of cbfs displayed greater induction in mature pollen of _PROTEIN_ mutants than that in wt following cold treatment . microarray analysis of the _PROTEIN_ mutant and wild type relative rna levels of cold related and _PROTEIN_ specific genes in microarray results . rna was extracted from mature pollen of the _PROTEIN_ mutant and wild type plants after treatment at for h. gene _PROTEIN_ levels were also measured by qrt pcr . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ rna in mature pollen of wild type and _PROTEIN_ plants . relative rna levels for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . relative rna levels for five _PROTEIN_ genes . relative rna levels were analysed using gene specific primers by real time pcr . _LOCATION_ bars indicate standard deviations of determinations from three independent rna extracts . differences between the wild type and _PROTEIN_ mutants after cold treatment were significant at p < or p < .
seeds of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were obtained from the arabidopsis biological resource center _PROTEIN_ . wild type a. thaliana col plants and the mutants were grown in a greenhouse with temperature controlled at and a h photoperiod . for practical reasons the different genotypes were grown harvested and processed in separate batches each concurrently with wt plants . flowers at developmental stage were marked at a fixed time in the morning . for the cold treatment the plants were transferred to a growth chamber _PROTEIN_ at under the same light conditions as in the greenhouse for h or h. after cold treatment mature pollen grains were harvested from the marked flowers by shaking in m mannitol as described by . the freshly harvested pollen was ground with quartz sand and total rnas were extracted using the rnaeasy plant mini kit . dna was removed via an on column dnase treatment and the rna extracts were stored at prior to use . to determine whether cold stress affects the segregation ratio of progeny from self fertilized _PROTEIN_ heterozygotes produced by crosses between _PROTEIN_ mutants and the wt and because _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ only in pollen plants with flowers at stage were treated with cold stress flowers from untreated greenhouse grown plants were used as the control . after cold treatment the _PROTEIN_ plants were transferred to the greenhouse and grown until the seeds were harvested . the seeds were germinated on murashige and skoog medium and genomic dna was isolated from the seedlings and used as a template for pcr amplification of dna fragments corresponding to the wt and the t dna insertion loci . the number of plants with the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ genotype and the number of plants with the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ genotype were counted . to quantify the fertility of flowers exposed to cold stress further the number of seeds in siliques from flowers that were treated at for h or h was scored . to determine which gametophyte was responsible for the abnormal segregation ratio reciprocal crosses between cold treated heterozygous and unstressed wt plants were performed . the progeny was analysed by pcr based genotyping . all experiments were configured such that the expected transmission was always and differences in the frequency of recombination between loci would have no impact on the outcome . in pcr based genotyping the presence of the t dna insertion allele was detected using the lb primer derived from the t dna sequence and a locus specific primer . presence of the wt allele was detected using the following gene specific primers _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ for _PROTEIN_ . light and _METHOD_ microscopic examination of dapi stained pollen including image capture and processing were performed as described previously . to characterize phenotypically mature pollen of the _PROTEIN_ homozygous mutants under cold stress the pollen viability of homozygous plants was analysed . evaluation of mature pollen viability by staining with fluorescein diacetate _PROTEIN_ in vitro and pollen germination assays in vivo were performed as described previously with some modifications . to determine the pollen germination frequency in vivo flowers at the beginning of stage were emasculated . after waiting h to ensure that the stigma was receptive a saturating amount of pollen from a donor plant was placed on the stigma . after min the pistils were removed and directly stained with aniline blue on a glass slide for min before observation with an olympus ultraviolet _METHOD_ microscope . pollen grains attached to the stigma and in which a pollen tube was detected with uv _METHOD_ were classified as having germinated . to detect pollen tube elongation in vivo after cold treatment the plants were moved to the greenhouse for h after which pistils were excised and the stigma fixed in acetic acid ethanol for h then softened with m naoh for h. the stigma was washed in distilled water three times and then stained with aniline blue on a glass slide for min prior to observation by uv microscopy . pollen grains attached to the stigma and in which pollen tube growth in the style was detected by uv _METHOD_ were classified as possessing elongated pollen tubes . to produce transgenic plants the _PROTEIN_ full length cdna was cloned into the vector which contains the modified camv promoter . the recombinant plasmid was introduced into agrobacterium tumefaciens and used to transform a. thaliana using the floral dip method . the transformed lines were selected for resistance to kanamycin . northern blot analysis was used for further confirmation of their transgenic identity . high levels of homozygous lines were obtained from independent transformants . the kb promoter fragments of _PROTEIN_ were amplified using extaq and the gene specific primers . the resulting fragments were subcloned upstream of the gus reporter gene in the ti derived binary vector and introduced into wt arabidopsis plants . transformation and gus staining was performed as described by et al . . the _PROTEIN_ full length cdna was linked to the pbluscript _PROTEIN_ ii vector and the enhanced green _METHOD_ reporter gene _METHOD_ was subcloned behind the _PROTEIN_ cdna . the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fragment was cloned by ligation into the sites behind the camv promoter of . the plasmid was isolated using qiagen kits and concentrated to about . the recombinant plasmid was introduced into a. tumefaciens and used to transform nicotiana benthamiana epidermal cells . a plasmid containing _METHOD_ alone was concentrated as above and bombarded in parallel as a control . transformation of n. benthamiana epidermal cells and localization of the protein were performed essentially as described previously . cdna was obtained from total rna in a reaction volume using the first strand cdna synthesis kit . each cdna sample was diluted with water and of this dilution was used as template for quantitative rt pcr . half reactions were performed with the lightcycler faststart dna master sybr green i kit on a roche lightcycler real time pcr machine according to the manufacturer 's instructions . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was used as a control . gene specific primers used to detect transcripts are listed in supplementary table at jxb online . mikc type transcription _PROTEIN_ are known to be important regulators during pollen maturation and tube growth in arabidopsis and are negative regulators of the _PROTEIN_ gene . the effect of these genes _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ on _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ under cold stress and whether the _PROTEIN_ of mikc genes is affected by _PROTEIN_ and cold stress was investigated in the present study . quantitative rt pcr was used to measure mrna transcript levels for the five pollen _PROTEIN_ mikc genes in mature pollen of both the wt and _PROTEIN_ mutants . the effect of _PROTEIN_ knockdown on cold regulation of cbf transcription _PROTEIN_ was also examined as _PROTEIN_ is a cold responsive transcription _PROTEIN_ and the transcriptional activator cbf cold response pathway plays a prominent role in cold acclimation .
