xylan a major polysaccharide in plant lignocellulosic _METHOD_ is acetylated at o and/or o and its acetylation impedes the use of _METHOD_ for _PROTEIN_ production . currently it is not known what genes encode acetyltransferases that are responsible for xylan o acetylation . in this report we demonstrate an essential role for the arabidopsis gene _PROTEIN_ in xylan o acetylation during secondary wall biosynthesis . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was found to be regulated by the secondary wall master regulator _PROTEIN_ and specifically associated with secondary wall biosynthesis . its encoded protein was localized in the _LOCATION_ the site of xylan biosynthesis . the _PROTEIN_ mutation caused reductions in secondary wall _PROTEIN_ and stem mechanical strength . chemical analyses of cell walls revealed that although the _PROTEIN_ mutation did not cause apparent alterations in the xylan chain length and the abundance of the reducing end sequence it resulted in a significant reduction in the degree of xylan acetylation . the reduced acetylation of _PROTEIN_ xylan rendered it more accessible and digestible by endoxylanase leading to generation of shorter xylooligomers compared with the wild type . further structural analysis of xylan showed that the _PROTEIN_ mutation caused a specific reduction in o and o monoacetylation of xylosyl residues but not in di o acetylation or o acetylation of xylosyl residues substituted at o with _PROTEIN_ acid . consistent with _PROTEIN_ s involvement in xylan o acetylation an activity assay revealed that the _PROTEIN_ mutation led to a significant _PROTEIN_ in xylan acetyltransferase activity . together these results demonstrate that _PROTEIN_ is a putative xylan acetyltransferase required for o and o monoacetylation of xylosyl residues and indicate the complexity of the biochemical mechanism underlying xylan o acetylation .
during the course of study of genes regulated by _PROTEIN_ a master transcriptional regulator of secondary wall biosynthesis in arabidopsis we have previously identified roles for several _PROTEIN_ regulated genes in xylan biosynthesis indicating the effectiveness of using _PROTEIN_ as a molecular tool to search for new genes involved in xylan biosynthesis . in this report we focused on the _GENE_ gene whose _PROTEIN_ was highly induced by _PROTEIN_ overexpression and down regulated by simultaneous mutations of _PROTEIN_ and its functionally redundant gene _PROTEIN_ . the _GENE_ gene was previously named _PROTEIN_ and identified as a regulator of freezing tolerance because the _PROTEIN_ mutation results in a significant elevation in freezing tolerance in the absence of cold acclimation . the _PROTEIN_ gene was shown to be _PROTEIN_ in vascular tissues and its mutation caused a collapsed vessel phenotype and impaired water transport but its biochemical function is not known . our finding that _PROTEIN_ is an _PROTEIN_ regulated gene indicates its involement in secondary wall biosynthesis . to extend this finding we examined _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in different organs and cell types . quantitative pcr analysis revealed that at the organ level _PROTEIN_ was most highly _PROTEIN_ in elongated _METHOD_ _METHOD_ in which xylem and interfascicular fiber cells are undergoing _METHOD_ secondary wall deposition . at the cellular level _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was predominant in secondary wall forming cells xylem and interfascicular fibers which was further confirmed by the _PROTEIN_ reporter gene showing its specific _PROTEIN_ in xylem and interfascicular fibers under different developmental stages . to find out whether _PROTEIN_ is involved in the biosynthesis of cellulose which occurs at the _LOCATION_ membrance or the biosynthesis of xylan which is carried out in the _LOCATION_ we next investigated the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ . sequence analysis of _PROTEIN_ using the program for prediction of transmembrane helices in proteins predicts that _PROTEIN_ is a type ii _LOCATION_ protein with one transmembrane helix . subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ using _METHOD_ protein tagging in arabidopsis protoplasts revealed its co localization with fragile _PROTEIN_ a _PROTEIN_ glycosyltransferase known to be localized in the _LOCATION_ . the control protoplasts _PROTEIN_ yellow _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ alone showed _METHOD_ signals throughout the cytoplasm . together the _PROTEIN_ and subcellular localization analyses indicate that the _PROTEIN_ regulated _PROTEIN_ is most probably involved in the biosynthesis of xylan which takes place in the _LOCATION_ . to find out whether _PROTEIN_ is involved in xylan biosynthesis we first examined the effects of its mutation on secondary wall _PROTEIN_ and stem mechanical strength . a number of known xylan mutants affecting the biosynthesis of the xylan backbone or the xylan reducing end sequence including _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ exhibit common phenotypes such as retarded plant growth collapsed xylem vessels reductions in secondary wall _PROTEIN_ and stem strength and reduced xylose and _PROTEIN_ amounts in cell walls . in addition the _PROTEIN_ mutant seedlings often display a wilty leaf phenotype under high water transpiration conditions probably due to the impediment of water transport caused by the collapse of the xylem vessels . examination of the _PROTEIN_ mutant plants showed a number of phenotypes that are common to the above described xylan mutants including wilty leaves smaller rosette leaves and shorter inflorescence _METHOD_ reduced stem mechanical strength collapsed xylem vessels and reduced secondary wall _PROTEIN_ . however no major changes in cell wall composition were noticed in _PROTEIN_ compared with the wild type except for a slight _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ indicating that although the _PROTEIN_ mutant shares many phenotypes with the xylan mutants its lack of reduction in xylose content distinguishes it from these mutants with defects in the biosynthesis of the xylan backbone or the xylan reducing end sequence . in other words the _PROTEIN_ mutation may affect a step other than the biosynthesis of the xylan backbone or the xylan reducing end sequence . to ascertain a role for _PROTEIN_ in xylan biosynthesis we compared the structure of xylan from _PROTEIN_ with that of the wild type . koh extracted xylans from _PROTEIN_ and the wild type were digested with endoxylanase to generate xylooligosaccharides which were subsequently subjected to structural analysis using _LOCATION_ magnetic resonance spectroscopy . xylan from the wild type displayed resonances characteristic of of glca and meglca side chains at and p.p.m. respectively . it also exhibited resonances attributed to the backbone xylosyl residues and the xylan reducing end tetrasaccharide sequence d xyl l rha d gala d xyl . xylan from _PROTEIN_ showed all the characteristic resonances corresponding to the backbone xylosyl residues the xylan reducing end sequence and the glca side chains . the only noticeable difference between _PROTEIN_ and the wild type was the ratio of glca and methylated glca . in the wild type of glca was methylated whereas of glca was methylated in _PROTEIN_ . this increased glca methylation phenotype somewhat resembles a number of known xylan mutants such as _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in which glca side chains on xylan are completely methylated indicating that the increased glca methylation observed in _PROTEIN_ is likely to be an indirect effect common to some other xylan mutants . since we did not detect any major defects in the biosynthesis of the xylan backbone the biosynthesis of the xylan reducing end sequence or the substitution of glca side chains we investigated whether the _PROTEIN_ mutation affected the degree of o acetylation of xylan . since acetyl groups are lost during the xylan extraction with koh we used dimethylsulfoxide _METHOD_ to extract acetylated xylan . we first examined the amount of acetyl groups present in the total cell walls pectins and _METHOD_ extracted acetylated xylans . it was found that the _PROTEIN_ mutation resulted in > reduction in acetyl groups in both total cell walls and the xylan fraction but not in the pectin fraction indicating that the _PROTEIN_ mutation caused a defect in xylan acetylation . transformation of the wild type _PROTEIN_ gene into the _PROTEIN_ mutant not only rescued the defects in stem strength secondary wall _PROTEIN_ and plant growth but also restored the level of acetyl groups in both total cell walls and the xylan fraction to the wild type level . to examine the degree of xylan acetylation in the _PROTEIN_ mutant we digested _METHOD_ extracted xylan with endoxylanase to generate xyloligosaccharides which were subsequently subjected to _PROTEIN_ assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . the predominant signal peaks from wild type xylooligosaccharides are m/z and which correspond to and respectively . there are a number of other less abundant signal peaks corresponding to various _PROTEIN_ substituted with various numbers of glca meglca and acetyl groups . in contrast the most abundant signal peak from _PROTEIN_ xylooligosaccharides is m/z corresponding to _PROTEIN_ which is present in very low abundance in the wild type . two other signal peaks m/z and m/z corresponding to _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ respectively were also highly elevated in _PROTEIN_ compared with the wild type . on the other hand the signal peaks m/z and which correspond to longer xylooligosaccharides with more acetyl groups are significantly reduced in their abundance in _PROTEIN_ compared with the wild type . these results demonstrate that the _PROTEIN_ mutation increases the digestibility of acetylated xylan by endoxylanase leading to generation of shorter xylooligosaccharides with fewer numbers of acetyl groups compared with the wild type which is consistent with the reduced xylan acetylation observed in _PROTEIN_ . the finding that the _PROTEIN_ mutation causes a defect in xylan acetylation prompted us to investigate further the patterns of acetyl substitutions on xylan by nmr spectroscopy . acetylated xylan from the wild type exhibited resonances typical for acetyl groups around p.pm . and all the sugar groups between and p.p.m . . although the resonances for the acetyl and sugar groups were present in the acetylated xylan of the _PROTEIN_ mutant a significant reduction in the signals for acetyl groups was evident in _PROTEIN_ compared with the wild type . integration analysis showed that the relative amount of acetyl groups in _PROTEIN_ xylan was reduced by compared with the wild type which is congruent with the chemical analysis of acetyl groups on xylan . the average degree of substitution of the xylosyl residues with acetyl groups was reduced from in the wild type down to in _PROTEIN_ . we next examined whether the _PROTEIN_ mutation affected the distribution pattern of acetyl groups on xylan based on the fingerprint region of the nmr spetra of acetylated xylans . the proton resonances for different structural fragments were assigned based on the published data for aspen wood xylan and further confirmed by two dimensional heteronuclear single quantum coherence spectroscopy . the wild type acetylated xylan exhibited characteristic resonances corresponding to o monoacetylated xylosyl residues o monoacetylated xylosyl residues di o acetylated xylosyl residues and o monoacetylated xylosyl residues substituted at o with glca/meglca . in addition o linked acetyl groups were much more abundant than o linked acetyl groups in the wild type acetylated xylan . examination of the acetylated xylan from _PROTEIN_ revealed a signficant reduction in resonance signals for o monoacetylated and o monoacetylated xylosyl residues . integration analysis demonstrated that the signal abundance for o monoacetylated and o monoacetylated xylosyl residues was reduced by and respectively in _PROTEIN_ compared with the wild type . in contrast no reduction was noticed for the resonance signals attributed to di o acetylated xylosyl residues and o monoacetylated xylosyl residues substituted at o with glca/meglca . it was intersting to note that the resonance signals corresponding to glca/meglca were elevated in _PROTEIN_ compared with the wild type . together the nmr analysis of acetyl groups in xylan demonstrated that the _PROTEIN_ mutation specifically affected acetyl substitutions at o or o of xylosyl residues . to substantiate further the role of _PROTEIN_ in xylan acetylation we investigated whether the _PROTEIN_ mutation affected the xylan acetyltransferase activity . the acetyltransferase activity was assayed in stem microsomes using acetyl coenzyme a as an acetyl donor in the presence or absence of the acceptor . a high level of incorporation of acetyl groups onto the acceptor was detected in the wild type microsomes demonstrating that the wild type microsomes possess an acetyltransferase acitivty that is able to transfer the acetyl groups from the acetyl coa donor onto xylooligomer acceptors . assay of the acetyltransferase activity in _PROTEIN_ microsomes revealed a significantly reduced activity which was about of that of the wild type . in contrast the activities of two other xylan biosynthetic enzymes xylosyltransferase and methyltransferase were only slightly altered in _PROTEIN_ compared with the wild type . these results are consistent with the chemical analysis showing that the _PROTEIN_ mutation caused a specific reduction in xylan acetylation .
