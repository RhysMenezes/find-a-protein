the ambient light conditions mediate chloroplast relocation in plant cells . under the low light conditions chloroplasts accumulate in the light while under the high light conditions they avoid the light . in arabidopsis the accumulation response is mediated by two blue light receptors termed phototropins _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ that act redundantly and the avoidance response is mediated by _PROTEIN_ alone . a mutant j domain protein required for chloroplast accumulation response _PROTEIN_ lacks the accumulation response under weak blue light but shows a normal avoidance response under strong blue light . in dark _PROTEIN_ wild type cells chloroplasts accumulate on the bottom of cells . both the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants are defective in this chloroplast movement in darkness . positional cloning of _PROTEIN_ reveals that this gene encodes a j domain protein resembling clathrin uncoating _PROTEIN_ auxilin at its c terminus . the amounts of _PROTEIN_ transcripts and _PROTEIN_ proteins are not regulated by light and by phototropins . a green _METHOD_ protein _PROTEIN_ fusion protein showed a similar localization pattern to green _METHOD_ protein alone in a transient _PROTEIN_ assay using arabidopsis mesophyll cells and onion epidermal cells suggesting that the _PROTEIN_ protein may be a soluble _LOCATION_ protein . together these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ is an essential component of phototropin mediated chloroplast movement .
to identify mutations in genes other than _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ leading to defects in chloroplast avoidance movement we developed a new screening method to detect the chloroplast accumulation response called the gba . in this assay a leaf is detached at the petiole and the whole leaf placed on the surface of an agar plate . the leaf is irradiated with strong white light which results in a color change in wild type leaves from green to pale green as a consequence of the avoidance response . then the leaf is covered with a black plate with an open slit of mm in width through which part of the leaf is irradiated with weak blue light . a green band appears in wild type leaves through the accumulation response but mutants lacking the accumulation response do not develop the green band . as expected under whole leaf irradiation with the strong light the wild type leaf showed a green band with gba but _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants did not show a green band due to defect in avoidance response . to exclude _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants wba was also applied after gba . as described previously wild type and _PROTEIN_ leaves showed a white band under wba whereas _PROTEIN_ showed a green band . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ leaves showed no band . mutants lacking a band under gba and showing a white band under wba were selected as candidates for mutants deficient in the chloroplast accumulation response . about ethylmethane sulfonate _METHOD_ mutagenized seeds about fast neutron mutagenized seeds about ray mutagenized seeds and t dna tagged lines were screened and four mutants were obtained . all of them had a single _LOCATION_ recessive mutation and fell into two complementation groups . in this article we describe one of the groups termed _PROTEIN_ . two independent _PROTEIN_ alleles _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ were isolated . leaves from these mutants showed a white band under wba but no green band under gba . to confirm that this band phenotype in _PROTEIN_ mutants results from the impairment in chloroplast movement wild type and _PROTEIN_ mutant plants were dark _PROTEIN_ for about h and then irradiated with white light of or for h _PROTEIN_ . leaves were then fixed and the distribution of chloroplasts observed . in wild type plants the chloroplasts moved to the cell surface under ll condition in an accumulation response whereas they moved to the anticlinal wall under _PROTEIN_ condition in an avoidance response . in _PROTEIN_ mutants the distribution of chloroplasts under both ll and _PROTEIN_ conditions was similar to that of wild type plants under _PROTEIN_ conditions . however the area of cell surface occupied by chloroplasts under _PROTEIN_ was smaller than that seen under ll meaning that _PROTEIN_ mutants are normal in the avoidance response . to investigate chloroplast photorelocation movement in more detail part of a _PROTEIN_ or wild type mesophyll cell was irradiated with a microbeam of blue light and chloroplast movement recorded using a video camera . under these conditions wild type cells responded to low fluence rate blue light and the chloroplasts moved toward the light spot . in _PROTEIN_ mutants however the chloroplasts moved away from the beam spot even at the fluence rate of and never gathered in the irradiated area confirming that _PROTEIN_ mutants are defective in the chloroplast accumulation response but not in the avoidance response . in cells of wild type plants dark _PROTEIN_ for about h prior to irradiation we found that most of the chloroplasts were at the _METHOD_ of cells and few chloroplasts were visible on the upper cell surfaces . interestingly the chloroplast positioning in dark _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutant cells resembled that of wild type cells irradiated with _PROTEIN_ . dark _PROTEIN_ for longer time periods did not induce chloroplast accumulation on the cell bottom in _PROTEIN_ mutants . in cross sections of wild type and mutant leaves chloroplasts in the wild type cells showed accumulation on the cell bottom whereas chloroplasts in _PROTEIN_ cells did not sediment and were distributed randomly . surprisingly _PROTEIN_ mutant cells but not _PROTEIN_ mutant cells were also defective in chloroplast accumulation on the cell bottom . the chloroplast distribution was similar to that of _PROTEIN_ mutants . the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant also lacked the dark accumulation response and some chloroplasts were found on the upper cell surface . other alleles of _PROTEIN_ were also defective in the dark accumulation response . given that the dark accumulation response is normal in _PROTEIN_ a null allele and is impaired in several _PROTEIN_ alleles other than _PROTEIN_ it is likely that only _PROTEIN_ mediates this response possibly via _PROTEIN_ . to further investigate the role of the _PROTEIN_ gene in phototropin mediated chloroplast photorelocation movement the phenotypes of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutants were analyzed and compared with that of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ respectively . the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant has a similar phenotype to the _PROTEIN_ single mutant . in this experiment the accumulation response in _PROTEIN_ was very weak and chloroplasts accumulated less on cell surface compared to the wild type . the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant showed no band under either wba or gba and was defective in the dark sedimentation and avoidance responses although some chloroplasts were found on the cell surface under both ll and _PROTEIN_ conditions . however the chloroplast density on the surface was constant for at least h under ll or _PROTEIN_ conditions unlike in wild type or the _PROTEIN_ single mutant . experiments with microbeam irradiation revealed that the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutant cells failed to undergo both accumulation and avoidance movements indicating that the chloroplast distribution on the cell surface under ll and _PROTEIN_ conditions is not the result of light induced directional movements . the difference in chloroplast distribution between light and dark condition was not found in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutants . the chloroplast densities in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutant were constant _PROTEIN_ of the light conditions . the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutant plants lacked all three types of chloroplast movement . altogether _PROTEIN_ mediates three different types of chloroplast movement under the three light conditions tested _PROTEIN_ but _PROTEIN_ regulates only the accumulation response under ll and _PROTEIN_ . although chloroplasts were found at the cell surfaces of the periclinal wall in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plants the chloroplasts of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plants tended to be at the anticlinal wall similar to the chloroplast distribution in _PROTEIN_ mutants . taken together these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ must be an indispensable component for chloroplast accumulation movement with the exception of the avoidance response . initially the _PROTEIN_ mutation was mapped close to the simple sequence length polymorphism marker _PROTEIN_ on the lower arm of chromosome . to narrow down the map position of the _PROTEIN_ mutation further fine structure mapping was performed using the cereon arabidopsis polymorphism collection data which contains new sslp and cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence markers . analysis of chromosomes derived from the segregating mutant plants from crosses between the _PROTEIN_ columbia background and landsberg _LOCATION_ narrowed the position of _PROTEIN_ to two bacterial artificial chromosomes and . since the genomic sequences of these bacs are available the annotated genes within this interval were amplified by pcr in both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and then sequenced . both mutants contained a lesion in the putative open reading frame of one gene _GENE_ . sequences of several _PROTEIN_ sequence tags have been deposited in genbank . although some ests contain a polyadenylation site both and end sequences were determined by _PROTEIN_ pcr . recently two full length cdna clones corresponding to this gene were deposited in genbank . comparison between the two cdna sequences and our cdna sequence revealed that the complete coding region is present in all cdna clones . the gene consists of nine exons interrupted by eight introns . the _PROTEIN_ mutation is a c to t transition at the nucleotide from the start codon . the _PROTEIN_ mutation is bp deletion between nucleotides and which is predicted to truncate a splice site between intron and exon . transgenic _PROTEIN_ mutants carrying a t dna insertion containing a kb _GENE_ genomic fragment recovered not only the chloroplast accumulation response but also the dark positioning . however the _PROTEIN_ plants transformed with vector alone did not recover these responses confirming that _GENE_ corresponds to the _PROTEIN_ gene . the _PROTEIN_ gene is predicted to encode a amino acid polypeptide . domain homology searches show that the _PROTEIN_ protein contains a j domain at the c terminus . the j domain which contains the highly conserved his/pro/asp tripeptide plays an important role in organizing interactions with its _PROTEIN_ chaperone partner . the _PROTEIN_ j domain is similar to the j domain of auxilin a clathrin uncoating _PROTEIN_ in cow yeast and worm . auxilin has been shown to uncoat clathrin coated vesicles . the auxilin j domain interacts with _PROTEIN_ protein recruiting _PROTEIN_ to the clathrin heavy chain . across the c terminal domain _PROTEIN_ shares between and amino acid similarity with animal and yeast auxilins . a blast search revealed the existence of six other arabidopsis proteins similar to auxilin . the c terminal domain of _PROTEIN_ shares between and amino acid similarity with that of the six arabidopsis proteins . a his/pro/asp motif is completely conserved among all these proteins . however their n terminal domains have no homology to other nonplant auxilins and no other recognizable domain but a short stretch of conserved amino acids is found within a amino acid region of the n termini . recently sequences of full length cdna clones from rice were published . we searched the full length cdna database of the rice genome resource center and identified two cdna clones _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ as putative rice _PROTEIN_ homologs . comparison of genomic and cdna sequences revealed that the gene has nine exons and eight introns the same as the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ gene . the gene is predicted to encode a amino acid polypeptide and the amino acid similarity of the c terminal j domain with that of the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ protein is . protein has a higher similarity to _PROTEIN_ than to the other arabidopsis auxilin like proteins suggesting that is the rice ortholog of _PROTEIN_ . besides the j domain the _PROTEIN_ and proteins but not other auxilin like proteins share two blocks of conserved amino acids expvfgxxtssxrrr and vkgkvxdfxkifs . additional cdna sequences highly similar to were found in the maize wheat and barley est collections in database searches . however it remained to be determined whether these monocot _PROTEIN_ like genes are also involved in chloroplast movement . since we could not detect _PROTEIN_ transcripts by rna gel blot analysis _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ gene was determined by reverse transcription pcr . _PROTEIN_ gene was found to be _PROTEIN_ in leaves and _METHOD_ but not in root tissues of week old plants and _PROTEIN_ was higher in leaves than in _METHOD_ . in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants the _PROTEIN_ transcripts accumulated at levels similar to wild type . however _PROTEIN_ transcripts contain a c to u transition nucleotides from the start codon corresponding to the _PROTEIN_ mutation in _PROTEIN_ gene . this base change introduces a stop codon . in _PROTEIN_ amplified _PROTEIN_ fragments were thus slightly smaller than the others . the _PROTEIN_ transcripts had no exon sequence and contained premature stop codon . thus the two _PROTEIN_ alleles were deduced to encode prematurely truncated polypeptides . in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutants _PROTEIN_ transcripts accumulated at similar levels to wild type indicating that the defect in the chloroplast accumulation response is not a defect in the accumulation of _PROTEIN_ transcripts . to investigate accumulation of _PROTEIN_ protein in wild type _PROTEIN_ and phototropin mutant plants endogenous _PROTEIN_ protein was analyzed by western blotting with polyclonal antisera against the c terminus of _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ antisera recognized a protein band of around kd although it was larger than the predicted molecular _METHOD_ . this protein band was not observed in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants indicating that these two mutants are null alleles . _PROTEIN_ protein abundance in wild type plants was not affected by dark _PROTEIN_ for about h followed by irradiation with white light of or for h or darkness . moreover the amount of _PROTEIN_ protein did not change in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant plants . therefore the defect in chloroplast movement in phototropin mutants is not caused by the lack of _PROTEIN_ protein accumulation . since _PROTEIN_ plants also contain amounts of _PROTEIN_ protein comparable to wild type plants the unusual positioning of chloroplasts in _PROTEIN_ plants must not result from deficiency of _PROTEIN_ protein . to investigate _PROTEIN_ protein localization a cauliflower mosaic virus promoter driven fusion between the green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ gene and _PROTEIN_ cdna _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ transiently in onion epidermal cells and in arabidopsis mesophyll cells . a _METHOD_ vector alone was used as the control . in both type of cells transformed with the fusion protein _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was observed all over the cells including the _LOCATION_ . organelle specific _METHOD_ was not detected but in the onion epidermal cells _METHOD_ of cytoplasmic strands was clearly visible suggesting that both _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ itself must be distributed in the _LOCATION_ .
