characterization of the chloroplast proteome is needed to understand the essential contribution of the chloroplast to plant growth and development . here we present a large scale analysis by nanolc q tof and nanolc ltq orbitrap _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ of ten independent chloroplast preparations from arabidopsis thaliana which unambiguously identified proteins . novel proteins include various kinases and putative nucleotide binding proteins . based on repeated and independent _METHOD_ based protein identifications requiring multiple matched peptide sequences as well as literature _LOCATION_ encoded proteins were assigned with high confidence to the _LOCATION_ of which had a predicted chloroplast transit peptide . the protein abundance of soluble stromal proteins was calculated from normalized spectral counts from ltq obitrap analysis and was found to cover four orders of magnitude . comparison to gel based quantification demonstrates that spectral counting can provide large scale protein quantification for arabidopsis . this quantitative information was used to determine possible biases for protein targeting prediction by targetp and also to understand the significance of protein contaminants . the abundance data for stromal proteins was used to understand abundance of metabolic pathways and chloroplast processes . we highlight the abundance of stromal proteins involved in post translational proteome homeostasis and discuss the biological implications . n terminal modifications were identified for a subset of _LOCATION_ and chloroplast encoded proteins and a novel n terminal acetylation motif was discovered . analysis of ctps and their cleavage sites of arabidopsis chloroplast proteins as well as their predicted rice homologues identified new species dependent features which will facilitate improved subcellular localization prediction . no evidence was found for suggested targeting via the secretory system . this study provides the most comprehensive chloroplast proteome analysis to date and an expanded plant proteome database _PROTEIN_ in which all _METHOD_ data are projected on identified gene models .
to identify stromal and _LOCATION_ proteins in the chloroplast three independent arabidopsis chloroplast preparations from mature rosette plants were used . each preparation was separated into a soluble stromal and _LOCATION_ fraction and then resolved by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ followed by in gel trypsin digestion and identification by online nano liquid chromatography tandem _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ with an ltq orbitrap using data dependent acquisition and dynamic exclusion . biological replicates were analyzed two or three times to determine the technical variation of _METHOD_ acquisition as discussed further below . filtering criteria for _METHOD_ based protein identification were chosen to give an overall peptide false discovery rate _PROTEIN_ of as estimated by concatenated target/decoy database search . furthermore only one gene model per protein was selected which was either the one with the highest protein identification mowse score or in case of equal scores the one with the lowest model number . if the same set of peptides could be used to identify several different proteins these homologous proteins were reported as an ambiguous group with all possible proteins listed yet counted as one protein identification . for example _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ corresponding to rubisco small subunits and were counted as one identification because they were described by the same set of peptides . proteins were not reported if they could only be identified based on subsets of peptides matching to another identified protein . a more detailed description of the filtering procedures is provided in the section . overall proteins were identified unambiguously . in addition pairs or small groups of homologous proteins were identified . and summarize the identification results and show overlap between the experiments . the number of identified proteins from individual _METHOD_ _METHOD_ analyses were as follows i the stromal fraction from chloroplast preparation was analyzed three times yielding and proteins each ii stromal fractions from and were analyzed once each yielding and proteins respectively iii fractions enriched in _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ proteins were analyzed twice for and once for . additionally a low density _LOCATION_ fraction obtained by high speed centrifugation of stromal extract was analyzed for yielding identifications . venn _METHOD_ show overlap between proteins identified in different preparations . letter s denote soluble fractions letter t denotes _LOCATION_ fractions letters lm denote low

independent chloroplast preparations s enriched for chloroplast soluble proteins t enriched for _LOCATION_ proteins lm low density _LOCATION_ fraction r denotes technical replicate . number of un ambiguous protein identification i.e . several proteins that have the same set of peptides are counted as one identification only one gene model per accession was selected . percent of proteins predicted by targetp chloroplast signal peptide mitochondria other . number of identified unique peptide sequences number of unique peptide sequences is shown in parentheses for the combined dataset . number of tandem _METHOD_ spectra matched to peptide sequences . number of tandem _METHOD_ spectra associated with unique peptides i.e . those peptides that are not shared between different accessions . peptides representing a protein ambiguous group which was reported as one identification were considered unique for this group . to further assess the reproducibility between technical and biological replicates we then carried out a g test of independence of unique number of spectral counts for each protein . this shows that the technical variation resulting from on line chromatography and _METHOD_ analysis is very small while the biological variation was mostly due to undersampling of low abundant chloroplast proteins and infrequent observation of non chloroplast contaminants . it has been shown in dda lc _METHOD_ based analyses of digested protein mixtures that the number of _METHOD_ of spectral counts correlates with protein abundance . the matched spectral counts for each protein need to be normalized for protein properties to obtain an accurate abundance measurement . the most promising methods of normalization have been protein length or number of theoretical and relevant tryptic peptides possibly corrected for their propensity to be observed . to estimate abundance levels of the proteins identified in the three stromal preparations we calculated first the abundance _PROTEIN_ from unique counts and subsequently normalized af for number of observable tryptic peptides yielding naf . in cases where two or more homologous proteins were identified with shared and unique peptides the number of spectra from shared peptides assigned to each protein was determined based on the ratios of spectra derived from the unique peptides that identified each protein according to . shared counts contributed only once to the overall normalization . shows the frequency distribution of the _PROTEIN_ values of the naf corrected for number of tryptic peptides for the proteins in the initial unfiltered dataset from stromal samples . each bin on the x axis corresponds to a order of magnitude with the total population spanning five orders of magnitude . the bins are grouped into seven abundance classes . the percentage of chloroplast predicted _LOCATION_ encoded proteins is indicated with predicted ctp for the complete set . the _PROTEIN_ in ctp coincides with the _PROTEIN_ in abundance which is expected since most of the non chloroplast contaminants should be present at the lower end of the abundance spectrum . _PROTEIN_ abundance of stromal proteins were calculated from normalized spc and corrected for predicted full tryptic peptides of the mature proteins within _METHOD_ window of da . corrections were made for shared peptides as described in the section . each bin on the x axis corresponds to order of magnitude with the total population spanning five orders of magnitude . the bins are grouped into seven abundance classes . the percentage of chloroplast predicted _LOCATION_ encoded proteins by targetp is indicated . frequency distribution for the proteins in the initial dataset from stromal samples frequency distribution of stromal protein after application of successive filters as follows i after known non stromal chloroplast proteins _LOCATION_ were removed when only including proteins observed in or more independent preparations after removal of non chloroplast contaminants . with the objective to get a more accurate quantification of the actual stromal proteome we applied a series of filters to the initial data set . shows the frequency distribution of the protein abundance after known non stromal chloroplast proteins _LOCATION_ were removed . furthermore when we only consider proteins observed in or more independent preparations proteins are removed mostly from abundance classes iv v vi vii . cross referencing these remaining proteins to the existing literature suggested that of these proteins were non chloroplast contaminants . these were subsequently removed to yield the final set of proteins . the percentage of predicted ctp for these remaining proteins then increased to . the validity of the filtering is supported by the observation that the abundance distribution becomes closer to normal in agreement with the central limit theorem . in a previous study we quantified accumulation levels of chloroplast stromal proteins from image analysis of stained native gels _METHOD_ covering orders of abundance . to evaluate how the current _METHOD_ based quantification compares to this gel based quantification we cross correlated the abundance of stromal proteins accurately quantified in both studies . this showed a strong positive correlation as indicated by a spearman correlation coefficient of . it appears that the spectral counting technique underestimates the most abundant proteins in particular for the rubisco large and small subunits . however the gel based method is likely less accurate for the lower abundance proteins as the signal/noise ratio for spot intensity was low see . when using protein length rather than observable tryptic peptides the spearman correlation was slightly lower . stromal protein quantified in a previous study from image analysis of stained dimensional native gels _METHOD_ were directly correlated to _METHOD_ based quantified from the current ltq data set . _PROTEIN_ abundance of stromal proteins were calculated from normalized spc and corrected for predicted full tryptic peptides of the mature proteins within _METHOD_ window of da . this showed strong positive correlation as indicated by a spearman correlation coefficient of . to obtain better insight in the role of the quantified stromal proteome all proteins were evaluated for function using information from papers functional protein domain predictions and other resources . we used the mapman bin system for functional classification . as compared to previous chloroplast proteome studies the current study significantly increased coverage of lower abundant pathways . examples are nucleotide synthesis and degradation and nucleotide transfer represented by proteins out of the ctp predicted _LOCATION_ proteins assigned to this pathway with an average abundance _PROTEIN_ of . also a set of low abundant t rna synthetases were observed in the stroma with an average of while soluble proteins involved in tetrapyrole biosynthesis have an average abundance of . the quantified stromal proteome also has a high number of proteins involved in protein translation folding targeting processing aa modifications and proteolysis . here we highlight those stromal enzymes involved in the post translational protein homeostasis network steps including n terminal processing and modifications . relative concentrations of stromal proteins involved in the post translational protein homeostasis network are displayed with color coding . abbreviations are as follows _PROTEIN_ general stromal processing peptidase _PROTEIN_ b methionine deformylases b _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ methionine sulfoxide reductases ap amino peptidases _PROTEIN_ chaperone and of the groel/es system heat shock protein grpe nucleotide exchange _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ heat shock protein _PROTEIN_ chaperone cpsrp chloroplast signal recognition particle subunit and involved in protein targeting components _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ cpseca _PROTEIN_ dependent sec targeting component cptig a homologue of e. coli trigger _PROTEIN_ involved in protein folding at the ribosome _PROTEIN_ protein isomerase with unknown function clpp/r/s t c d subunits of the complete clp protease system _PROTEIN_ protease of the deg family _PROTEIN_ a zn protease suggested to be involved in degradation of processed ctps zn oligopeptidase a homologue of a peptidase that in e. coli was suggested to degrade small peptides down stream of the clp protease system _PROTEIN_ tripeptyl peptidase . we quantified proteins involved in the post translational protein homeostasis network steps . they include the general stromal processing peptidase _PROTEIN_ both known methionine deformylases _PROTEIN_ two methionine sulfoxide reductases seven amino peptidases the groel/es and dnak/j chaperone _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ protein targeting components _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and cpseca a homologue of trigger _PROTEIN_ the very abundant isomerase _PROTEIN_ the complete clp protease system _PROTEIN_ protease _PROTEIN_ protease suggested to be involved in degradation of processed ctps an oligopeptidase a a homologue of a peptidase that in e. coli was suggested to degrade small peptides down stream of the clp protease system and finally a tripeptyl peptidase _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ was shown to exist as a soluble approximately to mda complex and it was suggested that it is an exopeptidase that assists in aa recycling . these proteins span orders of magnitude with _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ being the most abundant and some of the amino peptidases being the least abundant . the average coefficient of variation for abundance for this group of proteins was which is excellent given that the abundance range of this protein population spans orders of magnitude . these data are consistent with previous quantification of the clpprs system _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ a high quality but older generation instrument with lower sensitivity and speed than the ltq orbitrap . these seven independent experiments identified a total of non redundant proteins with or more unique peptides of these proteins had a predicted ctps . the false positive protein identification rate for proteins identified with or more unique peptides was zero . when also including groups of proteins identified with only shared peptides the total number of identified proteins is with a ctp prediction rate . these data were used only for the evaluation for subcellular protein location but not used for quantification nor for _PROTEIN_ analysis as will be discussed further below . using the protein datasets from the ten biological replicates analyzed by ltq orbitrap or q tof we tested if proteins could be assigned to the chloroplast based on the _METHOD_ data alone . for that purpose we merged each of the ltq _LOCATION_ and stromal data derived from the same chloroplast preparation . we then filtered the identified accessions in these ltq and q tof data sets each separately using two simple and objective parameters i presence in at least independent preparations with at least unique matched _METHOD_ spectra per preparation the underlying assumption is that contaminations are often different in each independent preparation and ii at least different peptide aa sequences across the independent observations . this is to avoid proteins that are identified with repeated matched _METHOD_ spectra of only peptide sequence . examples are _PROTEIN_ and each multiple times identified with peptides iewinsvltvpl and edlispr respectively . applying these two simple filters resulted in _LOCATION_ encoded proteins with an ctp prediction rate and chloroplast encoded proteins in the ltq orbitrap data sets and _LOCATION_ encoded proteins with a ctp prediction rate and chloroplast encoded proteins in the q tof stromal data sets . reassuringly of the proteins identified in this filtered q tof dataset are also found in the filtered ltq datasets indicating that the chloroplast preparations were highly reproducible and consistent with the higher sensitivity of the ltq orbitrap . finally we reanalyzed in house _METHOD_ data that were underlying published analyses of _LOCATION_ associated lipoprotein particles or _LOCATION_ and of stripped _LOCATION_ and applied the same two filters for the data sets from each of the two types of preparations . collectively these highly filtered q tof and ltq datasets identified _LOCATION_ encoded and chloroplast encoded non redundant proteins . to evaluate our filter procedure we determined potential non chloroplast contaminants in this filtered dataset using an extensive cross correlation to more than fifty published proteomics papers on arabidopsis subcellular fractions as well as information extracted from tair from _PROTEIN_ and other literature . details for this manual curation are explained in the section . based on these cross correlations we found partially conflicting evidence for proteins and we did not assign them to any subcellular location . proteins were considered non _LOCATION_ contaminations . therefore _LOCATION_ encoded proteins _LOCATION_ were assigned to the chloroplast of which have a targetp predicted ctp . this dataset excludes groups of closely related homologues that we could not strictly distinguish by _METHOD_ data alone . in addition to the experimentally identified proteins we also extensively screened the literature for likely _LOCATION_ proteins . if the data provided for _LOCATION_ localization were compelling _METHOD_ these accessions were also assigned to _LOCATION_ . we did observe a significant percentage of these proteins by _METHOD_ _METHOD_ but sometimes they did not pass the requirement for multiple independent observations with at least two different peptide sequences as discussed in the previous paragraph . in addition several sets of well known chloroplast protein homologues were now also included . in total additional _LOCATION_ encoded proteins were assigned to the _LOCATION_ based on the literature bringing the total _LOCATION_ assigned dataset to _LOCATION_ encoded proteins . once _LOCATION_ encoded proteins are inside the chloroplast the n terminal ctps are cleaved by the general _PROTEIN_ . following ctp cleavage chloroplast proteins possibly undergo additional cleavage by the various amino peptidases and n terminal residues can be acetylated in an enzyme catalyzed reaction in which the amino group accepts the acetyl group from acetyl coa . for understanding protein function and location and also for various practical applications identification of the correct n terminus is important . unfortunately the only available ctp cleavage site predictor which is part of targetp is not very precise since it was developed in based on a small training set available at the time . to better define the ctp cleavage site and evaluate possible subsequent n terminal _METHOD_ all _METHOD_ data were reanalyzed allowing semi tryptic peptides and optional n terminal acetylation using a narrow ppm precursor ion tolerance window in the search . we point out that n terminal acetylation can not occur during sample preparation and occurs only enzymatically and can thus be taken as evidence for an authentic n terminus . we identified n terminal acetylated _LOCATION_ encoded proteins . acetylation leads to an increase in retention time and if both the non acetylated and acetylated peptides are present they can be identified as two peptides with different retention times and a _METHOD_ difference of da . an interesting example is shown for cysteine synthase . in this case two acetylated n termini were identified that differ by one aa in length . shows the _METHOD_ spectrum for the longer doubly charged n terminal peptide acetyl avsikpeagveglniadnaaqligk and shows _METHOD_ spectrum for the shorter doubly charged n terminal peptide acetyl vsikpeagveglniadnaaqligk . both spectra are of high quality with respective ion scores of and and with ions supporting assignment of the acetylation of the n terminal residue present well above the noise level . the longer peptide was also observed in the triply charged state in both non acetylated and n terminally acetylated _METHOD_ eluting minutes apart . this example demonstrates that the assignments of acetylated residues are not false positives . it also demonstrates that either ctp cleavage by _PROTEIN_ can occur at more than one precise position and/or that after the initial ctp cleavage by _PROTEIN_ additional processing occurs by chloroplast amino peptidases followed by n terminal acetylation . tandem _METHOD_ spectrum of doubly charged aa long n terminally acetylated avsikpeagveglniadnaaqligk peptide . precursor ion is indicated with red asteric . singly charged y ions are indicated by blue lines with corresponding aa residues shown on top peptide sequence should be read right to left starting with the most _METHOD_ y ion . singly charged b ions are indicated by red lines with corresponding aa residues shown top peptide sequence should be read left to right starting with the lightest b ion . ions whose presence strengthen the assignment of the n terminal acetylation y and y are also indicated . tandem _METHOD_ spectrum of doubly charged aa long n terminally acetylated vsikpeagveglniadnaaqligk peptide . precursor ion is indicated with red asteric . singly charged y ions are indicated by blue lines with corresponding aa residues shown on top peptide sequence should be read from right to left starting with the most _METHOD_ y ion . ions whose presence strengthen the assignment of the n terminal acetylation y and y are also indicated . the protein sequences around their respective experimentally determined n termini from these n acetylated proteins were aligned in a sequence logo plot . this illustrates conservation at the and positions as well as the and positions with the position representing the n terminus . the positions show a preference for and likely represents a combination of a consensus motif for the _PROTEIN_ and the n acetylase . interestingly while n terminal acetylation is a very common n terminal _PROTEIN_ in higher eukaryotes and lower eukaryotes n terminal acetylation is much less common in prokaryotes and relatively few acetylated n termini have been determined . given the bacterial origin of the chloroplast and the prokaryotic type chloroplast gene _PROTEIN_ and protein homeostasis machinery it is likely that acetylation patterns and the n acetylases in chloroplasts are more similar to prokaryotes than eukaryotes . most prokaryotic n terminal acetylated proteins are ribosomal proteins with a m s being most frequently acetylated and p t g and v less frequently acetylated . the second residue has a strong affect on the frequency of acetylation and in eukaryotes acidic residues stimulate acetylation while p and basic residues inhibit acetylation . sequence logo of the ctp cleavage site constructed for proteins for which n terminally acetylated semi tryptic peptides within residues from predicted ctp cleavage site were observed by _METHOD_ n terminally acetylated residue was assumed to represent true ctp cleavage site . sequence logo of ctp cleavage site constructed for proteins for which only non modified semi tryptic peptides within residues from predicted ctp cleavage site were observed by _METHOD_ n terminal residue of the semi tryptic peptide closest to predicted ctp cleavage site was assumed to represent true ctp cleavage site . sequence logo of stromal proteins for which the most n terminal peptide was within residues of the predicted ctp sequence logo of the predicted ctp of all annotated arabidopsis chloroplast proteins but only those proteins were used with a predicted ctp length of at least aa residues . sequence logo of the predicted ctp of rice proteins representing the best homologues for annotated arabidopsis chloroplast proteins but only those proteins were used with a predicted ctp length of at least aa residues . the prevalence of a v s t as acetylated residues in our chloroplast proteins suggests that acetylation is carried out by a so far unidentified nata type acetylase . interestingly the second position for these sequences is occupied by a s v or l which is different from the preference in eukaryotes although none of these residues have inhibitory effects on acetylation in eukaryotes . additionally the position is occupied by the small uncharged residues s a v and t in agreement with avoiding charged and very large residues in eukayotes . to distinguish between motifs for the _PROTEIN_ and the acetylase we also assembled those proteins for which the most n terminal identified peptide was within aa residues from the predicted ctp cleavage site and for which the n terminal residue was un modified . the sequences of these proteins were aligned assuming that the most n terminal identified peptide represented the true n terminus of the protein resulting in a sequence logo plot of proteins . the upstream residues at the and positions are similar to the sequence logo plot from acetylated proteins but with stronger conservation of the a at the position . the residues at the and position were enriched for a s but there was little conservation at the position . this suggests that the conservation at the position in was due to preference for the n terminal acetylase rather than _PROTEIN_ . this helps to define the consensus motif for n acetylation in chloroplasts which is important for future n acetylation predictions . interestingly the set of acetylated proteins but not the unmodified set showed also some conservation at the to positions . there is a potential pitfall in this analysis using tryptic digests in that the position is enriched for r or k. however using semi tryptic peptides rather than full tryptic peptides suppressed this potential pitfall which is obvious from the weak conservation lack of r or k at the position in the sequence logos . we note that the average length of the peptides in our analysis was residues explaining why there is little risk for artificial enrichment for r or k within the first residues down stream of the cleavage site . to illustrate this point we created a sequence logo of stromal proteins for which the most n terminal peptide was within residues of the predicted ctp this clearly shows an artificial enrichment of r and k at the position which has no biological relevance . the sequence logo of the original experimental training set showed a consensus sequence for the ctp cleavage site of . however using the same proteins to predict the ctp consensus motif with chlorop produced a consensus sequence of essentially moving the cleavage site one residue upstream . when creating a sequence logo of the predicted ctp from a much larger dataset of annotated arabidopsis chloroplast proteins we observe a similar consensus sequence as for the original training set and a similar upstream shift of one residue as compared to the experimental consensus sequence presented . moreover the sequence logo of the predicted ctp of our large dataset shows a similar enrichment for r at the position as originally observed . however our experimental data suggest that there is not such a strong preference for an r. the one residue upstream shift by the ctp cleavage site predictor is most likely a consequence of the build in preference for cleavage after an r as explained in . based on our experimental data and the low abundance of the amino peptidases quantified in our study it _METHOD_ unlikely that all imported and _PROTEIN_ processed proteins undergo systematically a one aa removal from the n terminus . we suggest that there is an excellent basis and larger experimental data set for improvement of the ctp cleavage site predictor . so far _LOCATION_ encoded proteins assembled from various papers have been identified in the chloroplast lumen . these proteins have a lumenal transit peptide down stream of the ctp which is needed to cross the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . in addition several integral _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ proteins also have an ltp . the ltq orbitrap analysis identified out of these lumenal proteins and except for the lumenal psi subunit _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ none of them showed n terminal acetylation consistent with cleavage of the ltp on the lumenal side of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and the lack of a known acetylase in the lumen . this also _METHOD_ the low _PROTEIN_ for acetylation . in addition we identified five integral _LOCATION_ proteins with known ltp . for of these ltp proteins we identified the processed n terminus that exactly matched the predicted cleavage site and/or n terminal edman sequencing data from previous studies . for one accession _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ we found that the most n terminal peptide matched the edman sequencing data but was residues downstream of the predicted ltp . this either suggests an unusual ltp cleavage after the residues dvs instead of after the predicted residues aha or this suggests that there was an additional cleavage event . interestingly the most n terminal peptide for oec like _PROTEIN_ and an isomerase _PROTEIN_ were upstream of the predicted ltp cleavage site indicating either incorrect ltp cleavage site prediction or identification of an intermediate processing step . the n terminal edman sequence of _PROTEIN_ coinciding with an ltp cleavage site was residues down stream of the n acetylated and unmodified peptides that we identified multiple times by _METHOD_ . this suggests that biogenesis of _PROTEIN_ is more complicated that anticipated . curated protein name . predicted start . edman sequence . edman start position n terminus by edman . aa start position of most n terminal _METHOD_ peptide . bold numbers indicate perfect match to edman sequence data and underlined numbers indicate perfect match to predicted ltp cleavage side . distance of most n terminal _METHOD_ peptide to cleaved ltp site . peptide observed in acetylated and unmodified form . genome wide predictions _PROTEIN_ and manual inspection suggest that there are possibly another unknown lumenal proteins . therefore we investigated those identified proteins for which the most n terminal peptide matched the predicted ltp cleavage site or was within residues downstream of the predicted ltp without any additional peptides matching upstream of the predicted ltp site . these proteins were then evaluated for experimental _METHOD_ _METHOD_ data and other information . this identified four putative lumenal proteins with unknown function three of which were also identified in our earlier _LOCATION_ analyses . the predicted ltp cleavage site for one of the proteins _PROTEIN_ coincides precisely with the most n terminal peptide identified . putative lumenal protein is an orthologue of cyanobacterial protein _PROTEIN_ which was suggested to be involved in assembly of the water splitting complex of psii consistent with location on the lumenal site of the _LOCATION_ . we note that _PROTEIN_ has another homologue in arabidopsis for which we previously determined the n terminus by edman sequencing and which we assigned to the lumen and was recently showed to be involved in psii assembly in arabidopsis . putative lumenal protein _PROTEIN_ has no predicted function nor predicted tmd and a maize homologue was found in maize _LOCATION_ . putative lumenal protein _PROTEIN_ was identified with strong _METHOD_ data in the _LOCATION_ and the most n terminal peptide suggests an ltp cleavage site of . chloroplast encoded proteins are synthesized with an n terminal formylated methionine residue . the n termini of chloroplast encoded proteins from various plant species were experimentally determined by edman sequencing across multiple studies and subsequently assembled and evaluated . this showed that most n formyl groups are removed by the chloroplast localized deformylases _PROTEIN_ and possibly _PROTEIN_ which were both quantified in our study . the deformylation is often followed by removal of the methionine presumably by one or several of the chloroplast methionine aminopeptidases _PROTEIN_ c d . in this study we only observed and quantified _PROTEIN_ suggesting that _PROTEIN_ is more abundant than the other two amino peptidases . since no systematic experimental n terminal analysis for chloroplast encoded proteins in arabidopsis we used the ltq analysis to evaluate information about the n termini of identified chloroplast encoded proteins . for chloroplast encoded proteins we determined the n terminus while the n terminus for several others could not be determined because they start with a short tryptic peptide of less than residues these short peptides are excluded from our database searches because of the relatively low information content . four out of those proteins _PROTEIN_ were identified with their n terminal methionine . the n termini of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were also observed with the methionine removed . in case of _PROTEIN_ the methionine was formylated however we must be careful as samples have been observed to become non enzymatically formylated during the sample preparation . for five proteins _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ we observed that the methionine was always removed and two of those processed n termini _PROTEIN_ were acetylated . in case of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ the first two residues were removed and the new n termini were acetylated . thus in addition to preferential n acetylation of a v s t m observed for the imported _LOCATION_ encoded proteins n acetylation can also occur at t r and p. cytf is the only c encoded protein with a ltp this ltp has residues . we did identify the processed n terminus of mature cytf which was not acetylated as expected since it is located on the lumenal side of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . the _METHOD_ based data were consistent with the data assembled or predicted in . n terminal removal and subsequent modification of new n terminal residue . from giglione et al s spinach t tobacco p pea w wheat a arabidopsis c cucumber . recently there was a report that a chloroplast _PROTEIN_ anhydrase was targeted to the chloroplast via the secretory system . it was shown that that this _PROTEIN_ anhydrase was synthesized with an n terminal sp and after cleavage in the _LOCATION_ it reached the chloroplast through an unknown mechanism . it was hypothesized that this maybe a more common pathway for targeting of _LOCATION_ encoded proteins to the chloroplast . therefore the _LOCATION_ encoded _LOCATION_ proteins were passed through the signalp predictor . only of the proteins were predicted to have a sp while negative test sets e.g . _LOCATION_ and mitochondrial proteins showed similar or higher sp prediction rates . therefore it _METHOD_ unlikely that a significant percentage of chloroplast proteins are targeted via the secretory system . in addition to our current analysis discussed above our previous analyses on smaller data sets _PROTEIN_ also show that the true positive prediction rate for ctp prediction by targetp is despite various reports of lower true positive rates for discussion see . properties and aa composition of ctp have been extensively analyzed in the past but the fold larger set of chloroplast proteins from this study provides an excellent opportunity to re evaluate these properties . we created sequence logos of the most n terminal residues and aa frequency distribution plots over the entire predicted ctp for the annotated _LOCATION_ encoded _LOCATION_ proteins . a weak three domain structure is discernable an n terminal domain beginning with ma rich in s l a and t potentially terminating with p a central domain lacking acidic residues and with s l and p overrepresented but _PROTEIN_ slightly towards the cleavage site while r increases and a c terminal cleavage site domain enriched in r and with a loosely conserved motif around the cleavage site . in contrast to previous observations the plots show that the boundary of the n region is rich in p but not g that acidic residues are underrepresented across the entire ctp and that apolar l and p are enriched in addition to the hydroxylated residues s and t . the plots also show that the second position is an a residue in only of the cases . sequence logos of the first n terminal residues and aa distribution and frequency across the normalized ctp length for annotated arabidopsis chloroplast proteins and the predicted rice homologues . only those proteins were used with a predicted ctp length of at least aa residues . to investigate if there is a significant difference between arabidopsis and rice chloroplast proteomes best rice homologues were obtained for the arabidopsis set . this resulted in rice proteins of which had a predicted ctp . sequence logos and aa frequency distribution plots were generated similarly as for arabidopsis . this showed that the second position in _LOCATION_ rice ctps is enriched for a s and e followed by a clear preference for small uncharged residues a s and l a pattern very similar to arabidopsis . on the other hand a much higher abundance of a in particular but also p g and r was observed in rice while n k s and t were less common in rice . surprisingly threonine is slightly underrepresented in these rice ctps compared to its general abundance in proteins . overall this is in agreement with an earlier report for smaller datasets . there is also a difference in the average length of the predicted ctps residues for rice and residues for arabidopsis p value < using mann whitney test . moreover the rice ctp content was slightly more conserved than for arabidopsis . finally the predicted ctp cleavage site for the chloroplast rice homologues is very similar as for arabidopsis but with a stronger enrichment for a over s . our analysis suggests that specific rice and arabidopsis ctp predictors might yield higher true positive rates and could also provide better predictions for other sequenced monocotyledons and dicotyledons . similarly a specific ctp predictor for the sequenced green algae chlamydomonas reinhardtii may help to alleviate the poor prediction success rates .

chloroplasts were purified from fully developed leaf rosettes . chloroplasts were lysed and stroma and _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ were collected principally as described in . a low density _LOCATION_ enriched fraction was collected by high speed centrifugation of stromal extracts . show the ratios of weighed spc between stroma and _LOCATION_ samples for some of the proteins which were identified in all nine experiments and provides a good indication of their subchloroplast localization . of _LOCATION_ or stromal proteins were separated by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and stained with _METHOD_ brilliant blue . each gel lane was cut into bands followed by reduction alkylation in gel digestion with trypsin and peptides were extracted as described in . peptide extracts were dried down and resuspended in formic acid for _METHOD_ analysis by either reverse phase nanolc esi qtof _METHOD_ or reverse phase nanolc esi ltq orbitrap and typically were injected for each run . the nanolc q tof was interfaced with a caplc system and an autosampler from waters . analysis by nanolc q tof was as follows used automated sample pickups peptide extracts were loaded at for min on a guard column

set using the charge state recognition files for peptide ions provided by _METHOD_ . for tandem _METHOD_ acquisition we used a scan range from m/z with a scan time of s and an interscan of s and a dynamic exclusion window of s. argon was used as collision gas . all _METHOD_ data from the q tof were processed using mascot distiller and the resulting peak lists were searched again against _PROTEIN_ database concatenated with a _PROTEIN_ where all the sequences were in reversed orientation using mascot with a significance threshold of . for each of the peak lists two searches were performed tryptic search and a semi tryptic search with methionine oxidation set as a variable modification and _PROTEIN_ of cysteins as fixed modification and the maximum _METHOD_ _LOCATION_ tolerance for precursor and products ions at respectively and da . using in house written filter the results both searches were combined in an excel spreadsheet . only matches from tryptic search were considered in protein identifications . the mascot output was automatically processed by in house software . the ltq obtrap was interfaced with an lc system _METHOD_ and an microas autosampler . analysis by nanolc ltq orbitrap was as follows used automated sample pickups peptide extracts were loaded at for min on a guard column followed by elution and separation on a pepmap reverse phase nano column using min gradients with water acetonitrile fa and acn water fa at a flow rate of nl/min . a precolumn splitter was used to reduce the flow rate of to . each sample injection and analysis was followed by two blank injections using min and min gradients to prevent carry over from sample to sample . the acquisition cycle consisted of a survey _METHOD_ scan at the highest resolving power followed by data dependent _METHOD_ scans acquired in the ltq . dynamic exclusion was used with the following parameters exclusion size repeat count repeat duration s exclusion time s exclusion window ppm . target values were set at and for the survey and tandem _METHOD_ scans respectively and the maximum ion accumulation times were set at _METHOD_ in both cases . acquired _METHOD_ data were searched with mascot using a significant threshold of . preliminary search was conducted with broad precursor tolerance window set at ppm . peptides with the ion scores above were chosen as benchmarks for off line recalibration . recalibration was performed using a perl script which adjusted precursor _METHOD_ in the peak lists . the recalibrated peak lists were searched again against _PROTEIN_ database concatenated with a _PROTEIN_ where all the sequences were in reversed orientation . for each of the peak lists three searches were performed tryptic search with precursor ion tolerance window set at ppm _LOCATION_ tolerant search with precursor ion tolerance window set at ppm semi tryptic search with acetylation of peptide n terminus set as a variable modification . for all of the three types of searches first and second peaks were considered as precursors without widening of the precursor ion tolerance using the corresponding mascot feature . additionally in all of the three searches methionine oxidation was set as a variable modification . using in house written filter the results of the three searches were combined in an excel spreadsheet . the ion scores threshold were set to which yielded final peptide false positive rate below . additionally for proteins represented only by one unique peptide _METHOD_ accuracy on the precursor ion was required to be within ppm . only matches from tryptic search were considered in protein identifications . for each of the proteins identified in stromal preparations total number of spectral counts and number of unique spc was extracted from the mascot output using in house written filters . in cases where two or more homologous proteins were identified with shared and unique peptides the number of spectra from shared peptides assigned to each protein was determined based on the ratios of spectra derived from the unique peptides that identified each protein similar to using formula where is the initial number of unique spc for i th protein the group afi is the abundance _PROTEIN_ used for quantification shared_spc number of total shared spc within the group and is the sum of all unique spc within the group . in cases of ambiguous groups as well as in the cases of protein subsets af was set equal to shared_spc with the whole ambiguous group treated as one protein . to obtain measure of protein abundance normalization formula was used with normalization _PROTEIN_ nf derived from mature protein sequence removed being either length in number of aa residues or alternatively number of fully tryptic peptides in the _METHOD_ range of to da . g test was performed across three technical and across three biological replicates of chloroplast stroma preparations as described in and in . briefly for each protein across m conditions tested the g statistic is calculated and then compared to the chi square distribution with degrees of freedom resulting in a p value . finally a correction for multiple testing is applied to the p values and proteins with significant changes in abundance are determined . the higher the number of proteins with significant changes the poorer is reproducibility . sequence logos were created using the web server at http //weblogo.berkeley.edu/ . the plots of binned frequencies were obtained by counting the aa frequencies at the two n terminal positions and positions around the predicted ctp cleavage site separately and cutting up the remaining internal part of the ctp in bins . in total bins . this is a simplistic way to investigate regional properties of all ctps _PROTEIN_ of their length differences . multiple sequence alignments of the ctps using clustalw with standard scoring _PROTEIN_ and parameter settings were uninformative . the mascot output files were automatically processed by in house software and a number of output parameters _METHOD_ number of unique queries highest peptide score highest peptide _LOCATION_ lowest absolute _LOCATION_ sequence coverage tryptic semi tryptic peptide and modified peptide sequences were uploaded into the _PROTEIN_ . the construction of the _PROTEIN_ was originally described in . since its inception in the _PROTEIN_ interface was improved and we renamed the data base from _LOCATION_ proteome db to plant proteome db to better reflect the content . the backbone of the _PROTEIN_ are all protein encoding accessions _PROTEIN_ with a theoretical analysis of all arabidopsis entries . also more detailed curated information about the _METHOD_ based identification can now be accessed this will allow the user to better evaluate the strength of protein identification . mascot and ion scores _METHOD_ accuracies matched aa sequences number of matching peptides and highest peptide score for each identification and other _METHOD_ based data are listed . the mapman bin system is used for functional assignment and all assignments for identified proteins were verified manually . to determine potential non chloroplast contaminants in this filtered dataset we used an extensive cross correlation to more than fifty published proteomics papers on arabidopsis subcellular fractions as well as information extracted from tair from _PROTEIN_ and other literature . the complete list of published proteomics papers and each of their accessions can be downloaded from _PROTEIN_ . as a rule of thumb subcellular localization by _METHOD_ and western blots was considered strong evidence although we noted that there are several examples of incorrect subcellular localization assignment based on _METHOD_ as discussed in . identification in published proteomics studies was sometimes difficult to judge since information about the strength of _METHOD_ based identification was not easily accessible . chloroplast proteins are among the most abundant cellular proteins and contaminations from the chloroplast are often observed in proteome analyses of other organelles . however if proteins with lower abundance ranks were identified in multiple non _LOCATION_ proteomics studies from the same subcellular fraction _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ they were considered contaminants . to avoid circular arguments when evaluating targetp predicted chloroplast localization was not considered in assigning proteins to the chloroplast . in addition all protein accessions can be directly cross referenced against identified proteins from more than published proteomics papers as well as the subcellular localization in go from tair localization data from _PROTEIN_ and best matching homologues in maize and rice many of these data types can be directly exported from the _PROTEIN_ as excel files .
