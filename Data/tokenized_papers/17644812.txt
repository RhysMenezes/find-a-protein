the proteomics of _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ has brought to date only scarce and partial information on the actual protein repertoire . in this work the plant _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ proteome of arabidopsis thaliana was investigated . a highly purified _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ fraction was washed by nacl and salts and the insoluble fractions were further analyzed by nano lc _METHOD_ . with proteins identified we hereby describe the largest _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ proteome diversity reported so far . half of the proteins were predicted to display transmembrane domains and/or to be anchored to the _LOCATION_ validating a posteriori the pertinence of the approach . a fine analysis highlighted two _PROTEIN_ specific and novel features . first the _PROTEIN_ functional category is represented by a majority of as yet unreported signaling proteins including receptor like kinases . second of the identified proteins are predicted to be lipid modified specifically involving double lipid linkage through n terminal myristoylation s palmitoylation c terminal prenylation or glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchors . thus our approach led for the first time to the identification of a large number of peripheral proteins as part of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and allowed the functionality of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ in the cell context to be reconsidered .
pm enrichment and degree of purity were assessed as described in marmagne et al . on each new pm preparation by western blots . considering previous biochemical and immunological tests chloroplastic and mitochondrial contamination was estimated to be less than each . salt treatments of the _LOCATION_ fraction are believed to abolish electrostatic interactions with integral _LOCATION_ proteins or the _PROTEIN_ head of lipids . improperly or weakly linked _LOCATION_ proteins are eliminated by such treatments leading to an enrichment in genuine _LOCATION_ proteins and to a lower sample complexity . sodium chloride and sodium _PROTEIN_ which have been proven to be efficient in previous analyses were chosen to increase further our knowledge of the pm proteome . analyses of insoluble nacl and _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ fractions led to the identification of proteins including only common entries . in this set only entries have already been identified in the hydrophobic pm proteome resulting from a chloroform/methanol solubilization or an alkaline washing of the pm fraction demonstrating that the different treatments are complementary . to classify the proteins we compiled information about the proteomics data results of predictions by bioinformatics tools information retrieved from different protein databases and appropriate literature as indicated in supplemental table i . table i shows that of proteins had no predicted subcellular targeting . proteins were predicted as secreted proteins strongly suggesting pm association . indeed of these proteins have been experimentally shown to be localized in _LOCATION_ in particular in pm . among the proteins targeted to mitochondria have already been identified in other pm proteomes and three have been shown to be localized in the pm suggesting an inaccurate targeting prediction for at least part of them unless these proteins have a dual targeting . for example the small g proteins arfs were predicted to be mitochondrial although they are known to be involved in the secretory pathway and _LOCATION_ organization . the occurrence of a pm receptor for gdp bound _PROTEIN_ in mammal cells is in agreement with a pm localization of arfs . likewise prediction of a mitochondrial location for v _PROTEIN_ subunits is likely to be wrong because the associated function is usually assigned to the tonoplast and/or the pm . wrong predictions were also found among proteins predicted to be chloroplastic . this appears to be the case of newly identified _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ proteins such as _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ . such dubious chloroplastic predictions may involve at least five proteins that have been found in previous pm proteomes . in this context it is noteworthy that abundant mitochondrial and chloroplastic _LOCATION_ proteins such as the _PROTEIN_ synthase subunits and the triose phosphate translocator respectively were not identified in the present pm proteome . on the other hand the pm fraction was also slightly contaminated by proteins from other organelles or from the _LOCATION_ as evidenced by the presence of histones and ribosomal proteins . finally table i shows that only proteins have already been identified in other _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ proteome studies consolidating their pm localization and further validating the present proteome . we concluded that our proteome displayed proteins that are known or are very likely to be located in the pm . according to the _PROTEIN_ database proteins of the present proteome can be considered as integral as they are predicted to possess at least one tm domain . other _METHOD_ including hmmtop or tmhmm to a lesser extent predicted a larger amount of proteins to display at least one tm domain . for example receptors lrr receptor like kinase _PROTEIN_ and lys m _PROTEIN_ which are known to span the _LOCATION_ were not predicted to have any tm domain by _PROTEIN_ whereas hmmtop predicted at least one tm domain for each of these four proteins . other sets of proteins need to be taken into account in a pm proteome if they are co or post translationally modified by lipid moieties . in this respect proteins with one tm domain were predicted to display such a modification either with a gpi anchor or via n myristoylation . in addition proteins without predicted tm domains were also predicted to be lipid anchored . this included gpi anchors n myristoylations c prenylations and one predicted with both myristoylation and prenylation . this set of putatively lipid modified proteins must be considered as peripheral proteins as they are not expected to be embedded in the pm unlike integral proteins do not use the _PROTEIN_ pathway for _LOCATION_ targeting and usually do not have tm domains . gpi anchors are firmly bound to the _LOCATION_ through double acylation involving both myristate and palmitate attachment linked via a phosphatidylinositol group to the c terminal side of the target protein . to make _LOCATION_ binding of prenylated or myristoylated proteins tighter another binding motif is required . such additional binding site includes s palmitoylation _PROTEIN_ contacts to the lipids of the _LOCATION_ via polybasic stretch or protein protein interaction domains . together with n myristoylation palmitoylation significantly increases the hydrophobicity of the targeted protein . among n myristoylated proteins were predicted to display an additional s palmitoylation site at their n terminus . this ratio corresponds to a much increased value compared with the average percentage characterizing the complete n myristoylated proteome . in contrast none of the n myristoylated proteins displayed a polybasic motif unlike in the myristoylated proteome . these data are fully in keeping with the surface modifications induced by salt treatments that are expected to inhibit the effects associated with electrostatic binding modes . this suggests that among n myristoylated proteins salt treatment had led to loss of those using a polybasic stretch in animals to contribute to pm binding . likewise among predicted prenylated proteins none display a polybasic stretch next to the c terminal acylation site whereas were predicted to undergo a double acylation at the c terminus including geranylgeranylation or s palmitoylation . together the data show that the majority of the putatively lipid modified proteins retrieved in the present pm proteome feature double acylation motifs . as a whole proteins were predicted to have either at least a tm domain or to be associated with the _LOCATION_ by a lipid anchor . among the remaining proteins a number of them have already been identified in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . for instance phospholipases _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ developmentally regulated _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ polypeptide proteins and annexin are known to be associated with the pm through protein protein or lipid protein interactions . the treatment led to the identification of a higher content of very hydrophobic proteins compared with the nacl treatment . indeed from the and the nacl treatments proteins of and proteins of respectively were predicted to have at least one tm domain . if the number of transmembrane segments is considered as a reliable probe of protein hydrophobicity the treatment appears therefore more appropriate compared with the nacl treatment for retrieving integral _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ proteins . it is also likely to more quickly remove soluble proteins that are weakly bound to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ such as peripheral proteins . nevertheless protein fractionation by the two techniques had almost the same efficiency for extracting proteins displaying lipid modifications although both treatments did not lead to the extraction of the same protein categories . predicted n myristoylated proteins were preferentially retrieved from the nacl fraction . in contrast the pellet contained all the predicted gpi anchored proteins among which only were identified in the nacl pellet . finally the two procedures were equivalent for fishing out putative prenylated proteins . together these data indicate how powerful salt treatments could be when dealing with the retrieval of specific types of putatively lipid modified protein . for instance nacl should be preferred over for n myristoylation and should be preferred for gpi anchors . although the topic of the present work was not related to quantitative proteomics it is tempting to determine the most abundant proteins associated with the pm by taking into account three criteria the best scores after either nacl or washing and the highest number of identifications in other pm proteomes . table ii shows proteins displaying at least two of these three criteria . besides pumps transporters and receptors it is surprising to find proteins involved in metabolism without any tm domains suggesting strong interactions with the pm likely due to functional complexes . among the last four proteins only _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ c were found in our studies and also in another proteomics work . the functional classification of the putative pm proteins is shown in fig . . based on both sequence homologies with known proteins and identification of predicted conserved domains only of the identified proteins were classified as unknown . this value is significantly lower than those reported previously and demonstrates the recent progress in arabidopsis genome annotation . the proteins with predicted functions have been divided into seven functional classes cell traffic transport cell structure protein maturation protein turnover cell signaling and metabolism . an eighth class contains two proteins involved in dna structure that are likely to correspond to contaminants . among the identified proteins have already been identified in other pm proteomes many of which belong to functional classes that are representative of well established pm functions . this is illustrated by the identification of several members of the _PROTEIN_ superfamily in the transport class such as p type h _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and several v type h _PROTEIN_ subunits . proteins from other large families for which at least one or a few members have been previously localized in the pm and functionally characterized are also represented in the transport class e.g . aquaporins from the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ intrinsic protein family phosphate transporters such as _PROTEIN_ or monosaccharide transporters such as _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ . similar examples are found in the intracellular cell traffic subclass like snare proteins among which are the syntaxins _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and the novel plant snare proteins _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ whose roles in cell trafficking and pm relationships have been well established . in the cell wall component subclass we identified well known proteins such as sexual signaling kinase substrate proteins _PROTEIN_ fasciclins including sos proteins and early nodulin like proteins . the occurrence of several putative gpi anchored proteins involved in cell wall formation such as _PROTEIN_ and pectin methylesterases further strengthened the pertinence of this functional analysis of the pm proteome . in addition to the aforementioned proteins assigned to _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ from previous proteomics studies the remaining proteins were newly identified in a pm proteome . a functional classification of these new pm proteins and their _PROTEIN_ physicochemical properties are reported in table iii . in this subset a striking feature is that proteins were predicted as lipid anchored proteins among which would be n myristoylated and would be prenylated proteins . thus the present proteome was enriched in proteins likely involved in transient interactions with the pm suggesting possible roles in signaling processes . indeed an outstanding characteristic of the proteins identified in the present pm proteome is that belong to the signaling class with the more representative ones classified as detoxification enzymes _PROTEIN_ binding proteins kinases or receptors . stress response proteins such as hypersensitive induced reaction proteins and remorins were also frequently found . among newly identified pm proteins a similar proportion has been classified also in the cell signaling category and is represented by the same subclasses except kinases . a detailed analysis pointed out that detoxification and _PROTEIN_ binding classes are _PROTEIN_ represented by new proteins and therefore constitute with the phosphatases three new subclasses specific to this proteome . the identification of a series of enzymes in the detoxification group such as peroxiredoxins prxiib and prxiid glutathione transferases _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ three thioredoxins h _PROTEIN_ two glutathione dehydrogenases _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ or the glutathione peroxidases _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ suggests a role of pm proteins in oxidative stress protection . _GENE_ and _GENE_ are predicted to be n myristoylated proteins which further ascertains their functional role at the pm . new protein kinases were also identified in the pm proteome several of them featuring putative n terminal myristoylation _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . _LOCATION_ targeting of _PROTEIN_ has been demonstrated . in this major category of proteins potentially modified by both n myristoylation and s palmitoylation the lipidic modification is essential for _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ targeting . this was clearly demonstrated for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis . another plant _PROTEIN_ from ice plant was shown to undergo a reversible modification in subcellular localization from the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and actin microfilaments in response to reduction in humidity . in relation to bacterial defense responses among new non myristoylated kinases the kinase pto and two pto kinase interactors were identified in the pm proteome . homologous genes in tomato are involved in a phosphorylation cascade initiated by recognition of the bacterial protein avrpto at the cell surface bringing further evidence for a role of these proteins at the pm . a large number of small _PROTEIN_ binding proteins newly identified in the present proteome correspond to _PROTEIN_ proteins . these proteins are active in their _PROTEIN_ bound form which is _LOCATION_ associated following post translational lipid modifications i.e . prenylation in a. thaliana . half of them belong to the _PROTEIN_ subfamily which might play a role in signaling pathways leading to the delivery of new cell wall components to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . the large number of _PROTEIN_ members in that subfamily would reflect the great diversity of cell wall material to be delivered to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ such as hemicellulose integral cell wall proteins or cellulose synthase complex . the two other _PROTEIN_ subfamilies well represented _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ would be involved in the regulation of endocytic trafficking pathway . one of the most interesting classes of proteins found in this pm proteome was the one of receptors especially because of their very large number . we focused on _PROTEIN_ which play important roles in many plant signal transduction pathways . _PROTEIN_ are secreted proteins with part of the protein anchored within the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ as suggested by the occurrence of a single transmembrane domain a cytoplasmic c terminal kinase domain and an _LOCATION_ n terminal domain . this large family is represented by more than genes in the arabidopsis genome . to date _PROTEIN_ proteins have been identified in former proteomes and it is noteworthy that never more than _PROTEIN_ had been reported in the same proteome . in the present proteome _PROTEIN_ were identified including new members representative of different subfamilies such as extensin lrr or _PROTEIN_ . among the new _PROTEIN_ we identified the somatic embryogenesis receptor like kinase _PROTEIN_ a well characterized _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ receptor involved in the acquisition of embryogenic competence and in male sporogenesis . moreover a refined analysis of the list showed that the proteome contained the _PROTEIN_ and the _PROTEIN_ two proteins participating with the co receptor _PROTEIN_ associated receptor kinase also in the present proteome _PROTEIN_ in the _PROTEIN_ protein complex . several other _PROTEIN_ proteins well known for their roles in defense responses against pathogen attacks are also present this is the case for the flagellin sensing _PROTEIN_ receptor that mediates innate response to bacterial pathogens and the _LOCATION_ shuttle protein interacting kinase _PROTEIN_ involved in antiviral defense response . the protein _PROTEIN_ is also present this new _PROTEIN_ has been shown to amplify defense gene signaling for the innate immune response against pathogens . proteins _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ involved in stress response were also identified . identification of various subunits of functional pm complexes in the present proteome is further validation of the pertinence of our approach . analysis of the proteins newly identified in the pm pointed out functional classes that were poorly or never observed in proteomics studies published so far . these new proteins define different functional subclasses and to some extent assign new functions that emphasize the tight interaction occurring between _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and other cellular compartments . proteins participating in the sequential steps of endocellular trafficking and secretion were identified subunits _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ of the exocyst complex involved in _PROTEIN_ exocytosis at the pm several snare proteins such as _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ involved in specific vesicle fusion with the pm dynamin like proteins _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ that might be involved in clathrin mediated vesicle trafficking together with some of the new proteins also identified in the present proteome such as clathrin small chain _PROTEIN_ and clathrin heavy chain and other proteins such as and involved in vesicle formation from the _LOCATION_ to the _LOCATION_ compartments . these data illustrate the interplay between pm and the various endomembrane _METHOD_ of the cell . newly identified proteins belonging to large families from kinesins and two profilins _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ known to regulate _LOCATION_ dynamics and play specific roles in cell elongation and cell division were also identified . the presence of this protein category is another example of the close interactions between pm and _LOCATION_ . two _LOCATION_ glutamine synthases and were identified in the pm proteome . this suggests that enzymes could be transiently targeted to the pm for facilitating interactions with pm proteins . was demonstrated to interact with _PROTEIN_ a myristoylated protein kinase . likewise the cell wall glycine rich protein _PROTEIN_ might interact with a pm wall associated kinase as it was shown in the case of _PROTEIN_ . a last feature to emphasize is the identification of metabolism enzymes several participating in cell wall composition or in the biosynthesis of cell wall components such as cynnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase or nucleotide rhamnose synthase/epimerase reductase . several of them including the strictosidine synthase and the endotransglycosylase meri have been identified in the cell wall proteome showing the faint barrier between pm and cell wall proteins . functionally the presence in the same compartment of these enzymes and _PROTEIN_ g proteins suggests that these processes are regulated at least partly at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ level . the rest of the identified proteins define functional classes that were as yet never associated with a pm . interestingly the proteins belonging to the class protein turnover is composed almost exclusively of proteins that were never identified in previous pm proteomics studies . these proteins are _PROTEIN_ soluble proteins but their biological role may involve transient interaction with the pm . this was suggested in the _PROTEIN_ cascade which could be activated from the cell surface . in agreement with this hypothesis in mammals signaling protein oligomerization transduction structures which are known to be essential for fas apoptosis signaling are formed at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . as to the armadillo repeat containing proteins it was also shown in tobacco that the armadillo protein interacts with the receptor like kinase at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . thus the presence in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ proteome of proteins involved in protein degradation processes is not unexpected because the apoptotic signaling pathway can be induced by many _LOCATION_ stimuli . the pm proteome analysis revealed a second new class of pm proteins the protein maturation class . among these proteins _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ of chaperones and cyclophilins were found . the interaction between proteins from these families and pm proteins have already been reported with _PROTEIN_ and with _PROTEIN_ a _PROTEIN_ . we also identified several peptidases such as _PROTEIN_ an aminopeptidase bound to the pm . with a few exceptions the proteins identified in the course of this study represent the largest proteome for a plant _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ reported so far because of the combination of two extraction procedures . compared with a previous study based on extraction and naoh washing the pm repertoire was widened with respect to the physicochemical properties of the identified proteins and the functions associated with these proteins some of them have never been pointed out in previous proteomics analyses of pm . interestingly part of the plant pm proteome overlaps the proteome of lipid rafts . lipid rafts are known as pm microdomains that have specific roles in stress response and signaling and are enriched in lipid modified proteins . in the present pm proteome we identified a large number of proteins displaying putative lipid modifications suggesting that the pm proteome is enriched in peripheral proteins transiently interacting with the pm . whether all or only parts of the putatively lipid modified proteins of the pm proteome belong to lipid rafts is still unknown . in particular predicted prenylated proteins were included in the new set of pm proteins . to our knowledge such proteins had never been observed in former studies including lipid rafts . functional analysis of the newly identified proteins highlights three other remarkable characteristics of the present proteome . first close interaction with other cell compartments _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ cell wall and endomembrane _METHOD_ highlights the central role of pm . proteins from the two subclasses cell wall component and cell wall synthesis might be extrinsic due to their location at the interface between the cell wall and the pm and have a function that depends on the two compartments . in other respects evidence for functional interactions with the endomembranes is the identification of proteins involved in the intracellular cell traffic and _PROTEIN_ binding proteins _PROTEIN_ suggesting a close connection between the pm and the _LOCATION_ apparatus . second the high enrichment in signaling proteins in particular in receptor like kinases _METHOD_ the unique role of pm in signal perception and transduction processes . as already pointed out several set of proteins participating in functional complexes at the pm level were identified in the present pm proteome . third new functional classes were identified further supporting previous evidence for a role of pm in protein processing i.e . protein degradation via the ubiquitin proteasome pathway and protein maturation . altogether our data exemplify that the combined proteomics approach on a target _LOCATION_ the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ herein is a powerful tool for retrieving specific types of putatively lipid modified proteins and may also bring new insights toward a functional proteome .
the arabidopsis cell culture condition the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ purification procedure and associated purity assessments were as described in marmagne et al . . briefly day old suspension culture cells were collected and a microsomal fraction was obtained after grinding and a series of differential centrifugations . a pm enriched fraction was purified from microsomes by two phase partitioning between polyethylene glycol and dextran . to eliminate polyethylene glycol a second partitioning was achieved with a m solution . the pm fraction recovered in the saline lower phase was ultracentrifuged and the resulting pellet was resuspended in mm mops/naoh mm dithiothreitol . this yielded the purified pm fraction that was further analyzed . preparations of nacl and insoluble protein fractions were as described previously . pm protein fractions were suspended in ml of m nacl or m . each mixture was _PROTEIN_ for min on ice and centrifuged for min at g. insoluble proteins were recovered as pellets and resuspended in denaturing gel electrophoresis buffer _PROTEIN_ m tris hcl bromphenol blue m dithiothreitol glycerol . one third of either the nacl or pm fraction was resolved by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . sample migration was allowed for a length of cm according to bromphenol blue stain . after _METHOD_ blue staining of each salt fraction the gel was cut into discrete bands . in gel digestion with trypsin as proteolytic enzyme was carried out as described previously with the following modification . after washing and drying gel pieces were rehydrated in of at room temperature for min in the dark . this step led to cysteine oxidation and conversion of the methionine residues into sulfone . gel pieces were then finally extracted with formic acid solution . tryptic peptides were resuspended in aqueous trifluoroacetic acid . the samples were injected into a caplc nano lc system and first preconcentrated on a mm pepmap precolumn . the peptides were then eluted onto a column . the chromatographic separation used a gradient from solution a to solution b over min at a flow rate of nl/min . the lc system was directly coupled to a q tof ultima _METHOD_ spectrometer . _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ data were acquired and processed automatically using _METHOD_ software . mascot was used for database searching and proteins that were identified with at least two peptides both showing a score higher than were automatically validated . the score threshold for automatic validation was fixed at because for both nacl and datasets this value is just above the mascot score above which there is identity or extensive homology for peptide assignment with a probability of at least as quoted by the mascot output and the false positive rate as described by peng et al . was estimated to be and for the nacl and the datasets respectively . consequently we estimated that proteins identified by at least two peptides with a score higher than were significantly present in our samples . for proteins identified by only one peptide having a score higher than the peptide sequence was checked manually . peptides with scores higher than and lower than were systematically checked and/or interpreted manually to confirm or cancel the mascot suggestion . such a validation and false positive rate assessment was achieved using a home made validation software which allowed protein redundancy to be eliminated on the basis of protein identification by the same set or a subset of peptides from both nacl and datasets . database searching was carried out using the mascot program _PROTEIN_ . two databases were used a home made list of well known contaminants and an updated compilation of the a. thaliana protein database provided by tair _LOCATION_ . the variable modifications allowed were as follows acetyl acetyl n terminus methionine oxidation methionine sulfone cysteic acid false _METHOD_ assignment and false _METHOD_ assignment . two missed trypsin cleavages were allowed . similarly to other _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ proteomes about ribosomal proteins were identified that likely originated from _LOCATION_ bound polysomes anchored to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ via actin filaments . a total of proteins could eventually be retrieved . protein names and/or associated functions were retrieved from ncbi _PROTEIN_ or tair . _PROTEIN_ molecular weight pi and targetp annotations were retrieved from _PROTEIN_ . predictions of _LOCATION_ spanning regions were collected from the _PROTEIN_ database . the hmmtop program was also used for tm domain predictions . post translational modification predictions were performed on line using various dedicated _METHOD_ . n terminal myristoylation was first predicted by terminator using relaxed criteria . positive entries were next validated using the updated version of the arabidopsis database of myristoylated proteins using the software developed by boisson et al . . s palmitoylation on vicinal cysteines next to the n terminus of n myristoylated proteins was predicted with terminator . c terminal prenylation was predicted by preps . robust predictions of gpi anchors were retrieved from the _PROTEIN_ database that compiles three prediction _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ .
