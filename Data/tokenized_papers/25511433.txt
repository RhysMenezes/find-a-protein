photosystem ii is a multiprotein complex that catalyzes the light driven water splitting reactions of oxygenic photosynthesis . light absorption by psii leads to the production of excited states and reactive oxygen species that can cause damage to this complex . here we describe arabidopsis _GENE_ which encodes a previously uncharacterized protein that is a psii auxiliary core protein and hence is named photosystem ii . we present evidence that functions in the _PROTEIN_ of psii light harvesting complex ii supercomplex organization . encodes a protein with a chloroplast transit peptide and one transmembrane segment . in silico analysis of revealed a light harvesting complex binding motif within the transmembrane segment and a large surface exposed head domain . biochemical analysis of psii complexes further indicates that is an integral _LOCATION_ protein located in the vicinity of lhcii and the psii reaction center protein . phenotypic characterization of mutants lacking revealed reduced amounts of psii lhcii supercomplexes very low state transition and a lower capacity for nonphotochemical quenching leading to increased photosensitivity in the mutant plants under light stress . taken together these results suggest a role for in regulating and optimizing photosynthesis in response to changing light levels .
a mutant of _GENE_ was identified as part of the chloroplast functional genomics pipeline . over arabidopsis homozygous t dna lines were screened for altered chl _METHOD_ in plants grown under a photosynthetic photon flux density _PROTEIN_ of either or photons . the chloroplast project identified the mutant as having a very low maximal psii quantum yield following h of photoinhibiting light _PROTEIN_ . examination of the _PROTEIN_ of from transcriptome sequencing studies in arabidopsis revealed that had a similar transcript abundance to other auxiliary psii subunits . these results led to the hypothesis that the mutant was impacted in psii function . several lines of evidence confirm that the phenotype is due to a mutation of _GENE_ . first photosynthetic defects were found for homozygous mutants with two additional alleles and . second introduction of the native gene into by agrobacterium tumefaciens mediated transformation restored abundance and reversed the mutant growth and psii supercomplex accumulation phenotypes . to test the hypothesis that the subcellular localization of the protein is consistent with a function in the light reactions of photosynthesis anti antibodies were generated as described in materials and methods. these antibodies recognized a protein from leaf extracts of wild type plants that migrates under _PROTEIN_ and urea denaturing _PROTEIN_ consistent with a molecular _METHOD_ of kd . the protein was not detected in extracts from and demonstrating antibody specificity . the complemented line accumulates the protein to levels comparable to wild type plants . also the partial loss of function allele which has a t dna insertion in the untranslated region showed an reduction compared with the wild type amount of . the severity of the slow growth phenotype of the mutants correlated well with the degree of protein reduction with the growth of the mutant intermediate to that of the wild type and the two protein coding sequence insertion mutants . the total chl contents and chl a/b ratios of the mutant plants are slightly lower than those of wild type plants suggesting minor changes in the abundance of the chl containing complexes in the mutant plants in vivo . however levels of lhc psii psi cytochrome complex and _PROTEIN_ synthase proteins detected by immunodetection heme specific staining and two dimensional blue native/sds _PROTEIN_ coupled with _METHOD_ _METHOD_ showed no significant differences between mutant and wild type plants under nonstressful standard growth light conditions . chl content chl a/b ratio and oxygen evolution were obtained from fresh leaves . minimal _METHOD_ yield fv/fm functional reaction centers per cross sectional leaf area and photosynthetic performance index _PROTEIN_ were calculated from fast _METHOD_ induction . electron transfer rate of psii _PROTEIN_ quantum yield of psii and npq were obtained at steady state light induction . quenching related to state transitions was calculated from _METHOD_ measurements . proton motive force and were obtained by measuring the electrochromic band shift . n to . asterisk denotes a significant difference at p < and ns indicates no significant difference from the wild type at p no data collected or data absence . a search for homologs of arabidopsis among the plant and algal genomes available in the national center for biotechnology information database revealed one or two homologs of . and orthologs share similarity with rieske type proteins and the highest scoring structural homolog to in the protein data bank is the rieske type nonheme iron monooxygenase from pseudomonas putida . however neither the iron sulfur binding residues nor the mononuclear iron binding site is present in . and orthologs in land plants and algae contain a putative transmembrane region near the c terminus . in land plants this region includes a partial chl binding domain . the highest scoring blast hits of this domain are orthologs of arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ a protein in the lhc superfamily that is involved in npq in land plants . no orthologs of were found in cyanobacteria . instead the cyanobacterial genomes analyzed contain a closely related protein that has retained the iron sulfur binding residues and lacks the c terminal extension that is characteristic of . the algal genomes analyzed encode both an ortholog of and an ortholog of this cyanobacterial protein . to test the hypothesis that is a _LOCATION_ bound chloroplast protein situated close to psii a _METHOD_ fusion protein was transiently _PROTEIN_ in tobacco leaves _METHOD_ . _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and chl _METHOD_ were colocalized indicating that the fusion protein is targeted to the chloroplast . biochemical fractionation methods were employed to confirm this finding and to further localize the native within a subcompartment of the chloroplast . intact arabidopsis chloroplasts were isolated by percoll gradient centrifugation lysed and further fractionated by suc density gradient centrifugation followed by immunodetection using a specific antibody . consistent with the hypothesis that is a _LOCATION_ associated psii protein a signal was detected in _LOCATION_ containing and psii containing fractions _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ but not in the soluble chloroplast stroma or _LOCATION_ lumen fractions . the hypothesis that is a psii associated protein was evaluated by comparing its enrichment in spinach leaf psii lhcii and psii core complexes relative to that of the psii core protein a similar fold enrichment was obtained for the two proteins suggesting a similar stoichiometry in the psii protein complex . to identify the specific psii subcomplexes containing _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ were separated by blue native _PROTEIN_ followed by immunodetection using antibodies directed against psii protein psi chl a apoprotein _PROTEIN_ or . strikingly on blue native gels the ratio of the containing complexes was different in wild type versus mutant plants and again the difference was more dramatic in the plant with the null allele compared with the plant that retains of the _PROTEIN_ . the defect appeared to be specific to psii because both the abundance of tested polypeptides in the other complexes and the level of the psi supercomplex were unaltered in the mutant as monitored on the basis of _PROTEIN_ accumulation . was found in most containing psii subcomplexes . further evidence that is a psii component was obtained by cross linking against surface exposed _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ proteins and by coimmunoprecipitation using anti antibodies . was cross linked to a high mr protein complex that included the psii proteins lhcii and . coimmunoprecipitation also showed an interaction with and _PROTEIN_ . these findings are consistent with the hypothesis that is present in the peripheral region of psii close to and lhcii . the total protein contents of and in _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ are indicated as percentages . the distributions of and in psii protein complexes are estimated by quantitative immunodetection of blue native gels . the results shown are averages of three to five replicates with sd indicated . n.d. not detected . to verify the orientation of within the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ we used a gene fusion which encodes alkaline phosphatase followed by the alpha peptide of galactosidase as a topological reporter in escherichia coli . this approach relies on the bioenergetic analogy both between the bacterial periplasm positive side and the _LOCATION_ lumen in which protons accumulate during active electron transport and between the bacterial cytoplasm negative side and the _LOCATION_ stroma which becomes proton deficient . high phoa activity indicates a p side location of the reporter while lacz activity indicates an n side location of the reporter . as shown in supplemental figure when the phoa reporter is fused to the n terminal side of the transmembrane region transformants display predominantly galactosidase activity suggesting that the rieske like domain faces the stroma . because of the purple coloration of the two c terminal constructs we can not distinguish between a periplasmic localization or insertion of the fusion in a transmembrane region the latter is supported by i tasser structure prediction . we attribute the slow growth phenotype of mutant plants to the impairment of photosynthesis which is consistent with the physical association of the protein with components of psii and lhcii and the change in distribution of chl containing complexes in the corresponding mutant . to further pursue this we measured photosynthetic electron transfer function under various light conditions . first the activity of the psii complex was assessed by measuring oxygen evolving activity and chl _METHOD_ in vivo . notably oxygen evolving activity _PROTEIN_ in the mutants even at relatively low light levels _PROTEIN_ and was further _PROTEIN_ at higher light intensity . this _PROTEIN_ of activity in the mutants could be explained by the observed instability of the psii lhcii supercomplexes . furthermore consistent with the lower oxygen evolving activity the mutant plants displayed a lower fv/fm ratio compared with wild type plants both under growth and high _PROTEIN_ . in line with these results only a slightly lower fv/fm ratio of was obtained in dark acclimated mutant plants compared with in the wild type plants . additional chl _METHOD_ studies monitoring psii in dark _PROTEIN_ plants transferred to various light conditions showed that the photochemistry parameter for photochemical quenching was higher in mutants than in wild type plants . this parameter gives an indication that a larger proportion of mutant psii reaction centers stayed open compared with in wild type plants . additionally mutants had an overall higher electron transfer rate compared with wild type plants . interestingly chl _METHOD_ studies from light exposed plants that were subsequently dark _PROTEIN_ showed a lowered electron transfer rate for the null mutant compared with wild type plants which correlates well with the slow growth phenotype . in line with the above results the abundance of both and _PROTEIN_ to of the initial value in mutants exposed to _PROTEIN_ and further _PROTEIN_ to to of dark acclimated levels following irradiation at _PROTEIN_ . in contrast wild type plants _PROTEIN_ dark acclimated and levels following a shift from dark to _PROTEIN_ . a _PROTEIN_ in wild type reaction center proteins was observed only following a shift to _PROTEIN_ . the above results and the observed whole plant phenotype show that mutant plants lacking are sensitive to light stress conditions . to investigate the relative extent of light induced oxidative damage to psii proteins in the mutant compared with the wild type we measured ros accumulation and abundance in light exposed leaves . light treatments of _PROTEIN_ resulted in increased hydrogen peroxide superoxide and singlet oxygen levels in the mutant leaves as well as reduced steady state protein accumulation . to address whether the increased ros levels contributed to the loss of we investigated whether artificially increasing ascorbate levels caused an improvement in the photosynthetic performance index and the abundance in the mutant . a positive effect on the performance index and abundance was observed under low light conditions in the presence of ascorbate consistent with the hypothesis that ros damage contributes to the mutant photosynthetic phenotype . to ask whether reduced abundance in the mutant results from altered degradation or synthesis we tested the effect of the chloroplast protein synthesis inhibitor lincomycin on the photosynthetic activity . at low light both in the presence or absence of lincomycin the mutant showed _PROTEIN_ in levels and photosynthetic performance index as compared with the wild type . as expected these effects suggest not only that psii damage is elevated but also that psii repair is impaired . taken together with the observation that plants have greater degradation and lower photosynthetic activity in low light in the absence of lincomycin these results suggest that the _PROTEIN_ effect is on the efficiency of the repair cycle . further evidence that the repair cycle is affected is shown by a positive effect on when incubated with the reactive oxygen scavenger ascorbic acid . the growth phenotype of mutant plants at low and high light correlates well with the results above . the observations that mutant plants retain a reduced amount of psii lhcii supercomplexes have altered electron transfer within psii and are sensitive to photoinhibition suggest a role for in preventing psii damage and/or enhancing the stability of this complex . this led us to hypothesize that npq as a key regulatory component could be affected in the mutants . npq kinetics were measured at three different light intensities _PROTEIN_ and the plants carrying severe alleles displayed an initial increase and a subsequent _PROTEIN_ in npq compared with the wild type at and _PROTEIN_ . to our great surprise npq of mutant plants resembled that of wild type plants at _PROTEIN_ . the effect on npq observed with the mutant could be related to the observed loss of the psii lhcii supercomplex in the mutants but we were interested to determine whether the mutant also displayed other phenotypes indicative of impaired npq such as an altered luminal ph increased activity of the violaxanthin cycle and state transitions . to investigate these parameters we first analyzed the proton gradient and transmembrane potential in the lumen by measuring the electrochromic band shift at nm . no significant difference in proton motive force or was observed between the mutant and the wild type . to further test whether the violaxanthin cycle was altered we measured the deepoxidation state of violaxanthin by extracting pigments from leaves exposed to and _PROTEIN_ . in _PROTEIN_ the deepoxidation state was times lower in the mutant than in the wild type when exposed to _PROTEIN_ . that mutants show a relatively moderate change in npq activity can be put in comparison with _PROTEIN_ an arabidopsis zeaxanthin null mutant that still retains of the npq relative to the wild type . furthermore reflecting the almost normal npq at _PROTEIN_ the deepoxidation state of the mutant at this light intensity was similar to that of wild type plants . yet another component of npq is how plants regulate photosynthesis by state transition _METHOD_ . the state transition processes are influenced by the phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of various psii proteins and the trimeric lhc . the _LOCATION_ ser/thr protein kinases _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ which phosphorylate lhcii and psii respectively were shown previously to be activated by a reduced plastoquinone pool . we measured the phosphorylation status of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ proteins lhcii and in plants acclimated to dark _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . phosphorylation of lhcii was only slightly altered in mutants . this indicates that reduction of the plastoquinone pool is not limited by a loss of and suggests that the lhc state transition is functional in . on the other hand the phosphorylation level of psii was reduced in and mutants relative to the wild type and we propose that the lack of the psii lhcii supercomplex is the limiting _PROTEIN_ for psii phosphorylation in the mutant . in contrast to these findings the measured state transition was greatly altered in the mutants . the state transition from state to state and from state to state was very low in the leaky mutant and completely absent in the null mutant .
