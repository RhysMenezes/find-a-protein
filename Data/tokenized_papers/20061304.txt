we found a new hydrophilic protein in arabidopsis thaliana . real time pcr demonstrated that the protein was _PROTEIN_ in roots . histochemical analysis of promoter _PROTEIN_ fusions demonstrated its extensive _PROTEIN_ in root hairs . the protein is rich in proline glutamate valine and lysine residues and bound even in the presence of and k when examined by the overlay assay . treatment of seedlings with k na aba and gibberellic acid and cold and drought stresses enhanced the transcription . _PROTEIN_ of the protein linked to green _METHOD_ protein in a. thaliana showed its _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ localization and cell specific _PROTEIN_ in the epidermal cells including root hairs and the elongating pollen tubes . therefore we named the protein _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . the substitution of glycine at position with alanine resulted in cytoplasmic localization of _PROTEIN_ . these results and the n terminal characteristic motif suggest that _PROTEIN_ is n myristoylated at _PROTEIN_ . we examined the capacity for binding to phosphatidylinositol phosphates and found that _PROTEIN_ interacts strongly with ptdins ptdins and ptdins and weakly with ptdins . furthermore calmodulin was associated with _PROTEIN_ in a dependent manner and its association weakened the interaction of _PROTEIN_ with ptdinsps . these results indicate that _PROTEIN_ is involved in intracellular signaling through interaction with ptdinsps and calmodulin in growing root hairs . _PROTEIN_ was previously reported as microtubule associated protein . we discuss the physiological roles of _PROTEIN_ in relation to microtubules in cells .
_PROTEIN_ was found in a. thaliana as a protein similar to _PROTEIN_ which is a novel cation binding protein associated with the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ through n myristoylation . fig . shows the amino acid sequence of _PROTEIN_ aligned with those of _PROTEIN_ and related orthologs in nicotiana tabacum cicer arietinum and oryza sativa . although _PROTEIN_ shares only sequence identity with _PROTEIN_ both proteins have the characteristic motifs veekk and variants . in a phylogenetic tree _PROTEIN_ is far from a clade including _PROTEIN_ and tobacco drepps _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . _PROTEIN_ lacks two characteristic motifs kkaaaae _PROTEIN_ and kktel which are present in the other five proteins . the uniqueness of the primary structure of _PROTEIN_ suggests that it has a physiological role different from that of other proteins . furthermore the amino acid composition of _PROTEIN_ is different from that of _PROTEIN_ namely a notably high content of proline glutamate valine and lysine residues in _PROTEIN_ . these four residues occupy and of the residues of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ respectively . the high content of these four residues is a characteristic of titin protein . titin is a giant filamentous intrasarcomeric protein and is believed to act as a molecular ruler regulating the length of the _PROTEIN_ filaments in skeletal muscle . titin has unique sequences including a proline glutamate valine and lysine rich domain . the pevk domain is a motif that contains the four residues at high levels but the sequence is not fixed . parts of the pevk domain of titin have been shown to bind f actin . the pevk domain is found in _PROTEIN_ except for the n and c terminal regions . analyses of sequence motifs in _PROTEIN_ suggested that some residues are covalently modified . _PROTEIN_ has a putative n myristoylation consensus sequence met gly x x x ser lys at the n terminus . the second glycine residue may be linked with myristic acid . this possibility was demonstrated as described _PROTEIN_ . and are predicted to be phosphorylated with a high score by the netphos program . root specific _PROTEIN_ was demonstrated by quantification of the mrna level by real time pcr . the mrna was predominantly accumulated in week old roots although it was detectable in _METHOD_ shoots leaves flowers and siliques . this result was in agreement with the transcript levels obtained by dna microchip analyses _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . to investigate which cells _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ we cloned an upstream region that contains a non coding region of bp and a bp section of the coding region of _PROTEIN_ . the promoter construct was fused to a _PROTEIN_ reporter enzyme gene and introduced into a. thaliana plants . transgenic lines were analyzed for patterns of gus _PROTEIN_ . no significant differences in _PROTEIN_ were observed among independent lines . the gus signal was detected in roots especially the root hairs of and week old seedlings . gus activity was not present in root apices or emerging _PROTEIN_ roots . in week old roots gus activity was high in the basal region of _PROTEIN_ roots and their root hairs and was detected in an elongating region of the _PROTEIN_ roots containing root hairs . a similar pattern was observed in week old plants . in flowers gus activity was detected in elongating pollen tubes on a stigma but not in pollen bearing anthers . therefore it is clear that the _PROTEIN_ gene is strongly _PROTEIN_ at least in developing root hairs and elongating pollen tubes that exhibit tip growth . the effect of phytohormones and salts was examined . the level of _PROTEIN_ mrna was markedly increased after treatment with aba or gibberellic acid for h . under cold and drought stresses the mrna level was also increased about fold . treatment with nacl kcl or for d increased the mrna level > fold . the plants grew normally under these conditions with salts . enhancement of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ especially in root hairs of _PROTEIN_ roots by nacl and kcl was observed in gus staining profiles . to determine the intracellular localization of _PROTEIN_ we prepared two dna constructs encoding a fusion protein of _PROTEIN_ with _METHOD_ and transiently _PROTEIN_ it in a. thaliana suspension cultured cells . _METHOD_ was linked at the n _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ or c terminus of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . more than protoplasts were observed for each construct and typical images are shown in fig . . green _METHOD_ from _METHOD_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was clearly detected at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ of suspension cultured cells but the signal was seen neither in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ nor endomembranes . in contrast to _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ green _METHOD_ was detected in the _LOCATION_ for the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ construct . as mentioned above _PROTEIN_ contains a putative n myristoylation consensus sequence met gly x x x ser lys . if the protein is n myristoylated _PROTEIN_ will be the site of covalent modification . we prepared _PROTEIN_ mutants whose _PROTEIN_ was replaced by alanine linked to _METHOD_ at the n _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ or c terminus of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and then _PROTEIN_ them in a. thaliana suspension cultured cells . we observed > protoplasts for each construct by confocal laser scanning microscopy . green _METHOD_ of both constructs was detected in the _LOCATION_ but not in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ or _LOCATION_ . thus _PROTEIN_ might be essential to localize _PROTEIN_ in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and be the site of myristoylation for _LOCATION_ anchoring . to examine the intracellular localization and distribution of _PROTEIN_ protein in plant tissues we prepared a construct of _PROTEIN_ promoter _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and introduced it into a. thaliana . the _METHOD_ tag was linked at the c terminus of _PROTEIN_ to allow myristoylation at the n terminus if it occurs . fig . shows a typical image of green _METHOD_ of lines . green _METHOD_ of _METHOD_ was detected in roots and root hairs but not in the root meristematic or elongation zone . this observation was consistent with the result of the gus reporter assay . in root cells _METHOD_ of _METHOD_ was clearly detected in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ but not in the _LOCATION_ or _LOCATION_ . in general free _METHOD_ is distributed in the _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ . if _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were to be localized on the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ the _METHOD_ would be observed in large spherical shapes in the cells . the present _METHOD_ images matched the shape of cells well . thus we concluded that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was localized in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ in the tissues . to characterize the biochemical properties of _PROTEIN_ we prepared and purified recombinant _PROTEIN_ . it was difficult to obtain native _PROTEIN_ from plant tissues because of the low abundance of the protein in plants . we _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ with a tag in escherichia coli cells and isolated it from the soluble fraction of e. coli lysate . a highly purified preparation of _PROTEIN_ was obtained by ni _PROTEIN_ affinity column chromatography phenyl hydrophobic column chromatography and then qae ion exchange column chromatography . the recombinant _PROTEIN_ migrated in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ as an approximately kda protein which was inconsistent with the calculated mol . wt . of da . the kda band was not observed in the lysate of control e. coli cells and was reacted with antibody specific to a part of _PROTEIN_ as described _PROTEIN_ supporting that the protein at kda is recombinant _PROTEIN_ . this kda band is not of the oligomeric form because the recombinant _PROTEIN_ did not show a band at around kda under any conditions . there might not be an intramolecular disulfide bond in _PROTEIN_ because of the absence of a cysteine residue in _PROTEIN_ . slow migration of _PROTEIN_ may be due to the unique amino acid composition . we examined the ability of _PROTEIN_ to bind to since _PROTEIN_ is rich in glutamate residues and is partially similar to _PROTEIN_ that has been demonstrated to bind . _LOCATION_ sheets blotted with purified _PROTEIN_ were incubated with in the presence of mm and mm kcl and then rinsed with ethanol . the recombinant _PROTEIN_ reproducibly gave a clear positive signal of in a dose response manner . cam showed a positive signal in this assay but immunoglobulin a negative control gave no signal . the result indicates that binds to _PROTEIN_ even in the presence of and k at relatively high concentrations . the n terminal part of _PROTEIN_ is rich in lysine and aromatic residues . these characteristic sequences with clusters of basic/aromatic residues have been found in domains for interaction with ptdinsps . we determined the binding nature of _PROTEIN_ using _PROTEIN_ which were spotted with a series of ptdinsps . _PROTEIN_ bound to phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate ptdins and ptdins . the protein did not associate with lysophosphatidic acid lysophosphatidylcholine phosphatidylethanolamine phosphatidylcholine phosphatidylserine sphingosine phosphate phosphatidic acid ptdins p ptdins p or ptdins p. next we examined the effect of calcium on these properties because _PROTEIN_ was demonstrated to bind calcium . the selectivity of binding was not changed by the addition of calcium to the reaction mixture at but the affinity was slightly _PROTEIN_ . potassium did not affect the intensity or lipid selectivity even at mm but magnesium weakened the affinity but not the selectivity . further quantitative analysis was performed using a _PROTEIN_ . eight ptdinsps were quantitatively spotted on the array sheet . _PROTEIN_ bound ptdinsps in a concentration dependent manner . _PROTEIN_ had a high affinity for ptdins and ptdins and bound to them even at pmol on the sheet . its affinity for ptdins and ptdins was relatively low . binding to ptdins was clearly shown in this _PROTEIN_ test although the signal for ptdins was extremely low in the _PROTEIN_ strips assay . these results indicate that _PROTEIN_ can bind strongly to ptdins ptdins and ptdins and weakly to ptdins . it should be noted that a tag does not interact with ptdinsps . to examine the capacity of _PROTEIN_ to bind to cam we incubated the purified _PROTEIN_ with cam agarose . the _PROTEIN_ protein bound to cam agarose only in the absence of free cam and the presence of . the interaction of _PROTEIN_ with cam agarose was completely suppressed by additional free cam or egta in the reaction medium . these results clearly indicate a specific interaction of _PROTEIN_ with the cam complex . we examined the effect of cam on the affinity of _PROTEIN_ for ptdinsps . the amount of _PROTEIN_ bound to ptdinsps was notably _PROTEIN_ as shown by the intensity of the _PROTEIN_ signal in the _PROTEIN_ test . the intensity of the _PROTEIN_ signal was recovered when egta was added to remove free . these results indicate that cam binds to _PROTEIN_ and affects the association of _PROTEIN_ with ptdinsps in a dependent manner .
