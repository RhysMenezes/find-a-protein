_PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are two homologous proteins essential for phytochrome a controlled far red responses in arabidopsis . there are additional _PROTEIN_ related genes in the arabidopsis genome . the predicted sizes of this family of proteins range from amino acids to amino acids and they share to amino acid identities over their entire lengths . in addition most frs proteins contain one to three coiled coil domains and one or two putative _LOCATION_ localization signals . semiquantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction analyses revealed that all frs genes except _PROTEIN_ are _PROTEIN_ in all tissues examined including rosette leaves cauline leaves inflorescence _METHOD_ flowers and siliques . analyses of gene specific fusion reporter gene _PROTEIN_ revealed that all frs genes except _PROTEIN_ are _PROTEIN_ in hypocotyls and their _PROTEIN_ in hypocotyl is induced by far red light treatment . transient _PROTEIN_ of green _METHOD_ protein tagged frs fusion proteins in onion epidermal cells revealed that all frs proteins are targeted into the _LOCATION_ . t dna knockout _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants flowered early under both long day and short day conditions suggesting that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ regulate flowering time . in addition _PROTEIN_ rnai transgenic plants showed a specific hypersensitivity to red light inhibition of hypocotyl elongation and light regulated gene _PROTEIN_ indicating that _PROTEIN_ is a specific negative regulator of _PROTEIN_ signaling mediating seedling deetiolation . in summary our results support the notion that frs family members play distinct roles in light control of arabidopsis development most likely by regulating _LOCATION_ gene _PROTEIN_ .
we used full length peptide sequences of both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ as the query sequences in our blast searches against the arabidopsis genome sequences at the national center for biotechnology information web site and identified additional sequences that share significant homologies with both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ throughout most of their lengths . these homologous genes are distributed on all five chromosomes of arabidopsis with the exception of _PROTEIN_ which are arranged in tandem on chromosome iv . to carry out functional studies of the additional frs genes we sought to obtain their full length cdna clones . for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ full length cdnas were available when we initiated this work and were obtained from the arabidopsis biological resources center _PROTEIN_ . for other novel frs genes _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ we generated their cdna clones using reverse transcription pcr . for each gene a pair of primers with added restriction sites at their ends was designed to cover the longest open reading frame based on genome annotation . we obtained rt pcr products for all novel frs genes except _PROTEIN_ . these pcr products were subcloned into the pcr vector and validated by sequencing . all of these cdna clones with the exception of _PROTEIN_ are consistent with the annotation of the arabidopsis genome project and available cdna or _PROTEIN_ sequence tag sequences . sequence analysis of our _PROTEIN_ cdna and other reported cdna sequences indicated that this gene was misannotated in the number and locations of introns and that our cdna clone was missing approximately amino acids of c terminal sequences . we performed a separate rt pcr to generate the missing c terminal cdna fragment and ligated it to the original _PROTEIN_ cdna clone to create a real full length cdna clone for _PROTEIN_ . in the case of _PROTEIN_ we have been unable to obtain rt pcr products using various tissue sources _METHOD_ suggesting that the _PROTEIN_ transcript might be unstable or _PROTEIN_ at a very low level or only _PROTEIN_ under certain specific conditions . therefore the deduced amino acid sequence of _PROTEIN_ was used in our molecular analysis . summary of _PROTEIN_ gene family the predicted sizes of the frs family of proteins range from amino acids to amino acids . interestingly _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ share the highest homology to each other and they comprise a branch of this gene family . other frs proteins share to amino acid identities with _PROTEIN_ over their entire lengths . it is likely that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are products of a recent gene duplication event . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are most similar to each other and they also form a branch of the gene family . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ share the highest homology and form another branch . in addition the tandem arrangement and high homology between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ suggest that they are a pair of recently duplicated genes . all frs proteins except _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ contain one to three putative coiled coil domains _PROTEIN_ . further most of the frs proteins also possess one or two putative _LOCATION_ localization signals of four residue pattern . the putative nlss are located either in the c terminal portion in some frs proteins _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or in the n terminal half of other molecules _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ possess two putative nlss with one located in the n terminal half and the other in the c terminal half . three of the proteins _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ lack putative nlss . it is worth noting that _PROTEIN_ possesses neither coiled coil domains nor nlss whereas _PROTEIN_ is significantly smaller than the other frs proteins and contains three putative coiled coil domains . amino acid identities and similarities over the alignment lengths between predicted full length sequences of frs proteins in addition to the coiled coil domains and putative nls citation reported that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are related to mutator like elements . sequence analyses indicate that all predicted frs polypeptides share significant homology with the transposase domain of type ii mudr family transposons such as jittery and mudra of maize . in addition all frs proteins also share similarities with type ii mudr family transposons in the putative zinc binding motif with conserved cys and his residues . the zinc binding motif of transposon is involved in the nicking and transesterification steps of the integration process . the functional implications for these conserved domains in frs proteins are currently unknown . to understand the respective roles of the frs genes in plant development we conducted a semiquantitative rt pcr analysis to determine the tissue specific _PROTEIN_ patterns for all frs genes except _PROTEIN_ for which no rt pcr product was detected . the frs genes with detected rt pcr products are _PROTEIN_ in all organs examined including rosette leaves cauline leaves inflorescence _METHOD_ flowers and siliques . to extend the observations made with the rt pcr analyses we have generated reporter lines for each of the frs gene in which the _PROTEIN_ gene was fused to each of the frs promoters . promoter regions up to kb from these genes were cloned into the binary vector to replace the promoter and drive the gus gene _PROTEIN_ . these reporter gene constructs were introduced into columbia wild type plants via agrobacterium mediated transformation . several independent homozygous transformant lines were established for each of the reporter genes . histochemical staining analyses of gus activity revealed that all these frs genes except _PROTEIN_ are clearly _PROTEIN_ in hypocotyls . comparison of dark versus fr light grown seedlings showed that frs gene _PROTEIN_ in hypocotyls is induced by fr light treatment . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are also _PROTEIN_ in cotyledons of light grown seedlings . in addition _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are also _PROTEIN_ in roots whereas _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ have barely detectable or no detectable level of _PROTEIN_ in this tissue . these results are consistent with a potential role of these frs genes in regulating light control of arabidopsis seedling development . strikingly the _PROTEIN_ reporter gene is strongly _PROTEIN_ in hypocotyls and cotyledons despite the _PROTEIN_ that we have not been able to detect _PROTEIN_ transcript from these tissues using rt pcr suggesting that the native _PROTEIN_ transcript might be highly unstable . previously _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were shown to be targeted to the _LOCATION_ of onion epidermal cells and arabidopsis cells respectively . to determine the subcellular localization of the additional frs proteins we have generated green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ frs fusion protein constructs for each frs gene _PROTEIN_ in the _METHOD_ vector that contains the strong promoter to drive transient gene _PROTEIN_ . we conducted transient _PROTEIN_ assays to determine the fusion protein localization and light regulation in onion epidermal cells . after gene delivery by particle bombardment onion cells were incubated for to h under both dark and light conditions and then the _METHOD_ localization patterns were examined by microscopy . consistent with the presence of putative nlss in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ their _METHOD_ fusion proteins are localized into the _LOCATION_ . most strikingly we found that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are also targeted into the _LOCATION_ despite their lack of predicted nlss . it should be noted that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ to be _LOCATION_ enriched with residual amount of cytoplasmic distribution whereas other frs proteins seem to be exclusively _LOCATION_ localized . further the _LOCATION_ localization of these frs proteins is independent of the light treatment . for functional analysis of the frs gene family we searched the t dna insertional pools generated by the salk institute genome analysis laboratory and the syngenta arabidopsis insertion library for t dna insertion loss/reduction of function frs mutants . we used both antibiotic selection and pcr/sequencing to confirm the presence and determine the number of t dnas . for pcr confirmation we amplified the t dna flanking region for each t dna line using a left border primer and a gene specific primer . we have also backcrossed original lines with corresponding wild type ecotype to remove other possible background mutations and to reaffirm the cosegregation of the t dna insertion with the observed mutant phenotypes . homozygous mutant lines for two independent alleles of _PROTEIN_ designated _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and two independent alleles of _PROTEIN_ designated _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ have been identified from the signal population . in all four lines t dnas were inserted in the predicted coding regions and presumably would cause null mutations . rt pcr analysis showed that accumulation of their corresponding message rnas was abolished in these mutant lines . photobiology experiments were conducted to determine the effects of altering _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ gene _PROTEIN_ on light control of arabidopsis development . although all of these homozygous mutant seedlings deetiolated normally in response to different light conditions they all display a slight but reproducible early flowering phenotype under long day conditions _PROTEIN_ . under short day conditions these mutants flowered much earlier than wild type control plants . consistent with this both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutant plants also possess fewer rosette leaves than wild type plants at bolting suggesting that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ have a similar role in controlling flowering time . t dna insertion mutants for _PROTEIN_ were not available until recently . therefore we attempted to use the rna interference gene silencing technology to eliminate or reduce mrna accumulation . to achieve gene specific silencing two inverted repeat sequences of _PROTEIN_ were generated by pcr and inserted into the phannibal vector and a noti fragment containing this repeat sequence was cloned into the binary vector . this construct was transformed into col wild type arabidopsis and several homozygous transgenic lines were established . photobiology experiments showed that multiple homozygous _PROTEIN_ rnai lines exhibit a hypersensitive response specifically to continuous r light . this phenotypic alternation _METHOD_ to be specifically caused by rnai silencing of _PROTEIN_ as _PROTEIN_ mrna transcript level is undetectable whereas the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ the closest homolog of _PROTEIN_ is not affected in the rnai plants . to provide molecular evidence for the observed phenotypic abnormality of _PROTEIN_ rnai plants northern blot analyses were conducted to compare the _PROTEIN_ of cab and _PROTEIN_ two representative light responsive genes . after h of r light irradiation the induction of both cab and _PROTEIN_ is clearly more enhanced in the _PROTEIN_ rnai transgenic plants than the wild type control plants . together these results suggest _PROTEIN_ acts as a negative regulator specific to _PROTEIN_ signaling .
all arabidopsis materials are of col ecotype background . t dna insertion mutants were obtained from _PROTEIN_ . the seeds were surface sterilized and sown on murashige and skoog media plates with suc and cold treated for d at . then the plates were exposed to white light for h to stimulate seed germination before being transferred to frc r blue light or dark conditions for d at . fr r and blue
