sub functionalization during the expansion of gene families in eukaryotes has occurred in part through specific subcellular localization of different family members . to better understand this process in plants compiled records of large scale proteomic and _METHOD_ protein localization datasets can be explored and bioinformatic predictions for protein localization can be used to predict the gaps in experimental data . this process can be followed by targeted experiments to test predictions . the _PROTEIN_ database is a free web service at http //suba.plantenergy.uwa.edu.au that helps users to explore reported experimental data and predictions concerning proteins encoded by gene families and to define the experiments required to locate these homologous sets of proteins . here we show how _PROTEIN_ can be used to explore the subcellular location of the deg protease family of _PROTEIN_ independent serine endopeptidases _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . combined data integration and new experiments refined location information for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ confirmed _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in _LOCATION_ and deg in _LOCATION_ and provide substantial experimental evidence for mitochondrial localized deg proteases . two of these _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ additionally localized to the _LOCATION_ revealing novel dual targeted deg proteases in the _LOCATION_ and the _LOCATION_ . _PROTEIN_ is continually updated to ensure that researchers can use the _PROTEIN_ published data when planning the experimental steps remaining to localize gene family functions .
users can operate the _PROTEIN_ interface to ask simple questions about one protein at a time or to construct moderately complex sql queries using drop down menus and buttons to perform powerful boolean queries _PROTEIN_ across all entries for a protein family . the primary search tab allows the development of the query . once a query has been submitted the results page shows a table which contains the arabidopsis genome initiative _PROTEIN_ identifier a short description summary localization information from _PROTEIN_ predictions annotations _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ data . nearly all retrieved data are linked to a reference in pubmed . a variety of information and helpful links for each _PROTEIN_ in the result page is hyperlinked by access to the _PROTEIN_ flatfile . these data include detailed information on the subcellular localization predictions a cell cartoon displaying the probability values of the consensus location _PROTEIN_ access to _METHOD_ images for localizations if available and links to other resources for this _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ interface . screenshots showing the _PROTEIN_ search page where complex queries can be build using pull down menus in combination with _PROTEIN_ or and bracketing functions . the _PROTEIN_ results page of a query is shown with seven default columns and a download all results button in the left top corner . an example of a _PROTEIN_ flatfile showing detailed localization information of predictions annotations and experimental data _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ the _PROTEIN_ call displayed as pictographic heat map of a plant cell _METHOD_ images and other details such as the description amino acid sequence hydropathy plot and links to other useful websites at the bottom of the page . to query a particular gene family the full list of _PROTEIN_ identifiers can be entered in the _PROTEIN_ input box and directly queried in _PROTEIN_ . alternatively _PROTEIN_ can be searched by entering a descriptor in the keyword input box such as the name of a particular gene family in the genome annotation . for many gene families this type of search can be used to rapidly assess the predicted location and if applicable collate the experimental location information for each member . the importance of multiple pieces of independent evidence for high confidence assessments of subcellular location has been highlighted . _PROTEIN_ rapidly provides clarity on the available evidence and the methods used allowing researchers to make decisions to augment what is currently known with independent experimental approaches . using the search term degp protease as a keyword in a _PROTEIN_ search yields proteins . note the nomenclature of degp proteases has recently changed and we will now refer to them collectively as deg proteases _PROTEIN_ . this family of _PROTEIN_ independent serine endopeptidases functions in various proteolytic events in the cell . sixteen different deg protease gene loci are known in arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . two of the result outputs from _PROTEIN_ and are alternative splice variants of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ respectively . examining the _PROTEIN_ results for the remaining deg proteases shows that they are predicted to eight of the different physical locations in _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . eight deg proteases have been identified in subcellular proteomic studies and two of those eight have additionally been localized by _METHOD_ tagging . studying these data shows there are agreements and disagreements between predictors and/or between experimental datasets for the location of deg proteases . this raises a series of issues that can be addressed in turn by further analysis in _PROTEIN_ . firstly when experimental data are absent but prediction is clear is the experimental coverage of a given location extensive enough to expect the protein to have been found ? secondly when experimental data disagree could specific experiments be _LOCATION_ ? thirdly when experimental data disagree could the protein be multi targeted ? _PROTEIN_ result output for deg proteases in arabidopsis . querying the _PROTEIN_ database by entering degp protease as descriptor in the keyword input box returns results for gene products with location evidence . displayed are the location calls by _PROTEIN_ the predicted locations determined by the predictors in _PROTEIN_ the locations from the annotators tair amigo and uniprot/swissprot the experimentally determined locations by _METHOD_ tagging and _METHOD_ _METHOD_ as well as protein protein interaction _PROTEIN_ data . short tair descriptions are displayed in gray and the name of each deg family member is indicated on the left . to determine in which subcellular location a protein without experimental localization data can be expected to be found it is often very beneficial to generate a list of the subcellular locations of proteins by different experimental methods . an additional step supported by _PROTEIN_ is combining experimental sets like _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ tagging _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . using this approach _LOCATION_ and mitochondrial sets can be defined that contain and proteins respectively . these sets can be expanded by adding other proteins that are predicted to be in the relevant organelle to construct the total predicted proteome . for example by including proteins predicted by the three predictors targetp predotar and yloc _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ the _LOCATION_ proteome set is proteins and the mitochondrial set is . the sizes of a variety of organelle proteomes in plants and other eukaryotes have been previously reported in the literature . compiled localization data collected in _PROTEIN_ . table shows that over proteins have been located to the _LOCATION_ by _METHOD_ analysis which represents almost a third of all proteins located by this method . similarly proteins located to the _LOCATION_ by _METHOD_ tagging represent almost a fifth of all the proteins located by _METHOD_ tagging . taken together these datasets give a experimental coverage of the estimated _LOCATION_ proteome size in arabidopsis . thus it can be expected that experimental data are likely to exist for deg proteases located in _LOCATION_ . in _PROTEIN_ seven of the eight deg proteases for which experimental data exist have been localized to the _LOCATION_ by the _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ approach . in comparison only one deg protease has been localized to the _LOCATION_ . significantly fewer proteins have been localized to the _LOCATION_ experimentally and the coverage of the estimated _LOCATION_ proteome is only leaving more room for unidentified deg proteases to be found in this location . as new reports of subcellular locations of proteins accumulate in the literature discrepancies with previous observations inevitably accumulate as well . _PROTEIN_ gives an overview of these data sets and by using the literature referenced location is/is not described in option on the search page _PROTEIN_ gives access to data sets from each individual paper . to directly compare these individual data sets and to determine whether claimed locations have also been reported by other groups the _PROTEIN_ or and bracketing connectors in the search window can be used . for example and _PROTEIN_ began to define the peroxisomal proteome by _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ analysis listing and proteins respectively . the common set between the two studies is _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . in reumann et al . published a larger protein set of peroxisomal proteins and the common set between the two groups rose to proteins _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . similarly _PROTEIN_ and published _LOCATION_ proteome sets of and respectively . the common set of proteins shows that of the proteins listed in were also found by _PROTEIN_ . when a conflict between experimental data exists for a gene family _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ users can directly compare the individual research publications that reported the data sets and determine whether similar conflicts/contaminations have also been reported by other groups . _PROTEIN_ for example has been localized by _METHOD_ to two different locations by two independent research groups . found _PROTEIN_ in the _LOCATION_ whereas claim a _LOCATION_ location for this protein . using the literature reference location search with the _PROTEIN_ connector _PROTEIN_ results in a shared set of proteins that are claimed to be located in both compartments the _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ . examining this set of proteins further showed that of the proteins for which independent _METHOD_ tagging data exist were confirmed to be located in the _LOCATION_ whereas a _LOCATION_ location could only be verified for two proteins . this suggests that a _LOCATION_ location for _PROTEIN_ is more likely than a _LOCATION_ location . multi targeting of proteins was originally expected to be a rare event given the specialized function of the different subcellular compartments in a cell . however the number of proteins that have been shown to be multi targeted has greatly increased . currently more than proteins are known to be dual targeted to mitochondria and _LOCATION_ in arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ . this is due to the ease by which dual targeting can be confirmed by _METHOD_ tagging and because of an increased interest in processes expected to be common to these two organelles . these processes include dna replication and repair transcription translation and proteolysis . many proteins have been found to be dual targeted between other organelles in plants including mitochondria _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ mitochondria and _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ mitochondria and _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ mitochondria and _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ like vesicles and _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . in addition some proteins associate with the exterior of an organelle but do not penetrate the hydrophobic _LOCATION_ and thus whilst actually _LOCATION_ appear localized to a specific organelle . _PROTEIN_ can assist by systematically searching for putatively dual targeted proteins . using the information from the prediction _METHOD_ and the experimental data lists of candidates for dual targeted proteins can be generated . to compile a list of candidate proteins targeted to both _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ for example _PROTEIN_ can be queried for proteins that have been observed in these two locations by _METHOD_ tagging or _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ _LOCATION_ . this results in a list of proteins that have been observed in both locations . using sql or manually analyzing the _PROTEIN_ result file shows that in many of these cases both locations are reported within the same publication . therefore these are known dual targeted proteins . however for over proteins the two locations were reported in different publications and thus these are potentially unrecognized dual targeted proteins . repeating this process for _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ gives a list of proteins and for mitochondria and _LOCATION_ a list of proteins . these potential examples of dual targeting can be tested experimentally by _METHOD_ tagging import studies or other approaches . figure shows that for three deg proteases experimental localization data disagree . both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ have been localized to the _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ using _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . similarly _PROTEIN_ has been localized to the _LOCATION_ by _METHOD_ tagging and to the _LOCATION_ by _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . searching _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ data sets in _PROTEIN_ using the procedure described above results in a list of proteins localized to the _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ and a list of proteins for _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ . analyzing these two lists further shows that only four proteins for _LOCATION_ and twelve proteins for _LOCATION_ are reported by the same research group . thus for the majority of proteins the _LOCATION_ or _LOCATION_ dual locations were described in different publications including _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and thus these deg proteases are potentially unrecognized dual targeted proteins . when considering the deg protease dataset as a whole it became clear that the reasons for discrepancies could not be resolved without new data . the key experiments missing in order to determine if the proteomics data could be independently confirmed and to resolve conflicts or multi targeting were to systematically fuse the deg proteases to _METHOD_ and observe localization by _METHOD_ microscopy . to do this the full length coding sequences were amplified from cdna and used for the fusion with _METHOD_ . due to the low _PROTEIN_ of some of the deg proteases or the possibility of being pseudogenes their full length coding sequence could not be amplified from cdna . where possible the first bp were amplified from genomic dna or if the first exon was shorter than bp the longest possible region within the first exon was amplified . these deg sequences were c terminally tagged with _METHOD_ as most of the deg proteases were expected to be localized to the _LOCATION_ or _LOCATION_ based on prediction and n terminal fusions would have masked the targeting ability of the _LOCATION_ and mitochondrial signal peptides . on the contrary _PROTEIN_ contains a c terminal peroxisomal targeting signal _PROTEIN_ and a c terminally tagged _PROTEIN_ would be mistargeted . thus the _METHOD_ was fused to the n terminus of its particular coding sequence . the data obtained are presented in figure with additional co localizations available in supplemental figure . _METHOD_ images of the subcellular localization of deg proteases by _METHOD_ tagging . n and/or c terminal _METHOD_ fusion proteins were constructed . either the full length or part of the protein with the number of amino acids indicated in the schematic representation of each construct were fused to _METHOD_ . targeting ability was tested in arabidopsis suspension cells using _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ as a marker for _LOCATION_ targeting mcherry as a marker for mitochondrial targeting and mcherry _PROTEIN_ as a marker for _LOCATION_ targeting . multiple co localizations are presented for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ as these deg proteases localized to more than one subcellular compartment in this study suggesting dual targeting or conflicting localization results . scale as indicated . the _LOCATION_ location of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ reported by multiple proteomic studies was confirmed by _METHOD_ tagging . these proteases have been shown to function either in the chloroplast stroma _PROTEIN_ or in the _LOCATION_ lumen _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and it has been suggested that they are involved in the biogenesis of photosystem ii _PROTEIN_ protein homeostasis in the _LOCATION_ lumen and degrading and repairing damaged proteins in the _LOCATION_ lumen and the stroma . the _LOCATION_ location of _PROTEIN_ found by _METHOD_ studies could not be confirmed by _METHOD_ tagging despite using a full length fusion that should contain any _LOCATION_ localization signal of _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ data show that _PROTEIN_ interacts with _PROTEIN_ a transcription _PROTEIN_ localized to the _LOCATION_ that regulates seed germination and shows elevated _PROTEIN_ level just prior to germination . the _PROTEIN_ study was a large high throughput study based on the yeast two hybrid system _PROTEIN_ and awaits independent confirmation . as we can not exclude a location of _PROTEIN_ to the _LOCATION_ perhaps during germination this _PROTEIN_ data may be informative . however both proteomics studies that found _PROTEIN_ localized to the _LOCATION_ were performed on adult plants so do not directly support the germination hypothesis . the _LOCATION_ location of _PROTEIN_ reported by a single proteomic study _PROTEIN_ could not be confirmed by _METHOD_ tagging . instead _PROTEIN_ was found to be located in the _LOCATION_ . a mitochondrial location of this protease is also predicted by of the predictors in _PROTEIN_ including targetp _PROTEIN_ predotar and yloc . no experimental data on the location of deg proteases _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ have been published and nothing is known about their physiological roles . at least eight predictors in _PROTEIN_ predict a mitochondrial location for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and indeed we found these five proteases are targeted to the _LOCATION_ by our _METHOD_ tagging approach . surprisingly a _METHOD_ signal was also detected in the _LOCATION_ when _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion constructs were used to transform arabidopsis suspension cells suggesting that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are dual targeted to the _LOCATION_ and to the _LOCATION_ . interestingly _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were also predicted to both the _LOCATION_ and the _LOCATION_ when querying _PROTEIN_ using predotar targetp and wolf psort _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . very recently a semi quantitative proteomic approach has detected _PROTEIN_ in low abundance in the stroma lamellae of the _LOCATION_ supporting a _LOCATION_ location for this deg protease without excluding a mitochondrial location . in addition _PROTEIN_ was localized to the _LOCATION_ in our study . given these results we should bear in _PROTEIN_ that the full length coding sequence could only be amplified from cdnas of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ the first bp or less were amplified from genomic dna and fused to _METHOD_ . with proteomics data existing for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ but transcript and protein data being absence from publicly accessible databases for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ could indicate that these two deg proteases are pseudogenes . overview of the subcellular locations of deg proteases in arabidopsis . the location of _PROTEIN_ in _LOCATION_ was previously demonstrated by both subcellular proteomic and _METHOD_ tagging studies _PROTEIN_ . as shown in figure the peroxisomal location of _PROTEIN_ was confirmed again by this study . in vivo and in vitro analysis has shown that _PROTEIN_ is responsible for processing _PROTEIN_ containing proteins and plants lacking _PROTEIN_ display a phenotype potentially linked to reduced fatty acid oxidation due to lack of enzyme processing . the _PROTEIN_ query reported that _PROTEIN_ has been located by different proteomic studies to the _LOCATION_ and to the _LOCATION_ . the _LOCATION_ location of _PROTEIN_ could be confirmed here by _METHOD_ tagging . however the _LOCATION_ location could not be confirmed in this study . from the analysis of conflicts between published localization datasets a _LOCATION_ location for _PROTEIN_ is also suggested to be more likely than a _LOCATION_ location . as the physiological role of _PROTEIN_ remains to be elucidated the possible _LOCATION_ location of _PROTEIN_ will need to be proven by further independent analysis . _PROTEIN_ the last of the proteases for which proteomic data are available in _PROTEIN_ was reported to be located in the _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ . another study has found this protease in the chloroplast stroma by _METHOD_ tagging and immunoblotting . neither of these two locations could be verified by _METHOD_ tagging in this study instead _PROTEIN_ was localized to the _LOCATION_ and the _LOCATION_ . a _LOCATION_ location is plausible because _PROTEIN_ is putatively orthologous to the only fungal deg protease which is located in the _LOCATION_ . the _LOCATION_ location of _PROTEIN_ could have been missed by as the authors fused only the n terminal amino acids of _PROTEIN_ to _METHOD_ whereas in this study the full length coding sequence of _PROTEIN_ was fused to the n terminus of _METHOD_ . interestingly nls mapper predicts a bipartite _LOCATION_ localization signal from to amino acids . the analysis of _PROTEIN_ mutant plants revealed that the mutant is more sensitive to high light stress than wild type as demonstrated by an inhibited growth phenotype of _PROTEIN_ mutants when exposed to high light . additionally it was shown that _PROTEIN_ interacts directly with psii . thus a _LOCATION_ location of this protease is likely and may have been missed in this study for a reason associated with the _METHOD_ fusion or the intensity of _METHOD_ in the _LOCATION_ . _PROTEIN_ localized _PROTEIN_ to the _LOCATION_ using a proteomic approach . although purification techniques have improved immensely and the authors rigorously selected for _LOCATION_ proteins it is very difficult to avoid contamination of the _LOCATION_ by soluble proteins from organelles . thus the _LOCATION_ location of _PROTEIN_ could be due to contamination during the _LOCATION_ sample preparation . in _PROTEIN_ other soluble chloroplast proteins have been reported as _LOCATION_ in this study such as a chloroplast form of _PROTEIN_ sulfurylase _PROTEIN_ a _LOCATION_ triose phosphate isomerase _PROTEIN_ a chloroplast beta amylase _PROTEIN_ a _LOCATION_ uracil phosphoribosyltransferase _PROTEIN_ and an f type thioredoxin localized in the chloroplast stroma _PROTEIN_ . the localization of _PROTEIN_ represents an example of how contradictory location data can arise even when the same localization method was used . using _METHOD_ tagging we were unable to define a subcellular location for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . both proteases have been suggested to be potential pseudogenes because no transcript or protein data could be found in publicly available databases . indeed we were only able to amplify the first bp from genomic dna of _PROTEIN_ and arabidopsis suspension cells transformed with the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion construct showed a _METHOD_ signal but the subcellular compartment could not be determined .
_PROTEIN_ can easily be queried through a web browser based graphical user interface that is freely available at http //suba.plantenergy.uwa.edu.au . the interface works best via the mozilla firefox google chrome or safari web browsers but will work on microsoft explorer . currently entries are based on subcellular proteomic studies entries are based on _METHOD_ tagging studies and entries are based on _PROTEIN_ studies . _PROTEIN_ also contains bioinformatic predictions for protein localization from the output of prediction _METHOD_ . details of the database structure and sources have been described previously . to best estimate a protein s location in the cell _PROTEIN_ also contains a consensus location _PROTEIN_ based on bayesian probabilities calculated from all the experimental localization data and predictions available for each protein . the full length coding sequences where ever possible or the first bp of the coding sequences of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were amplified according to the manufacturer s instructions using the expand high fidelity pcr system with primers listed in supplemental table containing the attb sites for cloning . the pcr products of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were cloned into the vector and sequenced . the entry clone and a cloning cassette _METHOD_ were recombined to clone the full length or the first bp in frame with the coding region of the _METHOD_ at their n or c terminus . for co localization studies the small subunit _PROTEIN_ of arabidopsis ribulose bisphosphate _PROTEIN_ oxygenase fused to the n terminus of the red _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was used as a _LOCATION_ control the mitochondrial targeting sequence of yeast fused to the n terminus of mcherry in was used as a mitochondrial control and the peroxisomal targeting signal _PROTEIN_ fused to the c terminus of mcherry was used as _LOCATION_ control . the fusion constructs were biolistically transformed into cultured arabidopsis cells . the _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ plasmids were co precipitated onto gold particles and transformed using the biolistic _PROTEIN_ system . particles were bombarded onto ml of cultured arabidopsis cells resting on filter paper on osmoticum plates . after bombardment the cells were placed in the dark at . _METHOD_ images were obtained h after transformation using an olympus _METHOD_ microscope with excitation wavelengths of nm _METHOD_ and nm _METHOD_ and emission wavelengths of nm _METHOD_ and nm _METHOD_ . subsequent images were captured using imaging software .
