the histone deacetylases play important roles in the regulation of gene _PROTEIN_ and the subsequent control of a number of important biological processes including those involved in the response to environmental stress . a specific group of histone deacetylase genes _PROTEIN_ is present in plants . in arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ include _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . previous research showed that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are more related in _METHOD_ of _PROTEIN_ and function but not _PROTEIN_ . in this report we studied different aspects of _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis with respect to plant response to drought and other abiotic stresses . bioinformatics analysis indicates that _PROTEIN_ is distantly related to other _PROTEIN_ genes . transient _PROTEIN_ in nicotiana benthamiana and stable _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis of _PROTEIN_ fused with _METHOD_ showed that _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ in the _LOCATION_ . overexpression of _PROTEIN_ resulted in developmental changes including fewer _PROTEIN_ roots more _PROTEIN_ roots and a higher root shoot ratio . seed germination and plant flowering time were delayed in transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ but these plants exhibited higher degrees of tolerance to abiotic stresses including drought salt and cold stresses . physiological studies indicated that the malondialdehyde content was high in wild type plants but in plants overexpressing _PROTEIN_ the mda level increased slowly in response to stress conditions of drought cold and salt stress . furthermore electrolyte leakage in leaf cells of wild type plants increased but remained stable in transgenic plants . our results indicate that _PROTEIN_ is unique among _PROTEIN_ genes and it plays a role in plant growth and development regulation and these changes can modulate plant stress responses .
