actin filaments are often arranged into higher order structures such as the longitudinal actin cables that generate the reverse fountain cytoplasmic streaming pattern present in pollen tubes . while several actin binding proteins have been implicated in the generation of these cables the _METHOD_ that regulate their dynamic turnover remain largely unknown . here we show that arabidopsis thaliana actin _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is required for turnover of longitudinal actin cables . in vitro biochemical analyses revealed that _PROTEIN_ is a typical adf that prefers adp g actin over _PROTEIN_ g actin . _PROTEIN_ inhibits nucleotide exchange on actin and severs filaments but its filament severing and depolymerizing activities are less potent than those of the vegetative _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ primarily decorates longitudinal actin cables in the shanks of pollen tubes . consistent with this localization pattern the severing frequency and depolymerization rate of filaments significantly _PROTEIN_ while their maximum lifetime significantly increased in _PROTEIN_ pollen tube shanks . furthermore an _PROTEIN_ enhanced green _METHOD_ protein fusion with defective severing activity but normal g actin binding activity could not complement _PROTEIN_ providing compelling evidence that the severing activity of _PROTEIN_ is vital for its in vivo functions . these observations suggest that _PROTEIN_ evolved to promote turnover of longitudinal actin cables by severing actin filaments in pollen tubes .
to dissect the in vivo functions of _PROTEIN_ a t dna insertion line _PROTEIN_ was analyzed . no _PROTEIN_ transcript was detected in _PROTEIN_ plants suggesting that the allele is a knockout . pollen germination and tube elongation were initially assayed to determine the effects of loss of _PROTEIN_ . although pollen germination was not affected in _PROTEIN_ the pollen tube elongation rate was significantly _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ compared with that of the wild type columbia line . pollen tube elongation was fully rescued in the _PROTEIN_ line suggesting that this phenotype is indeed caused by loss of _PROTEIN_ . thus these data suggest that loss of _PROTEIN_ has no overt effect on pollen germination but inhibits tube elongation . we next sought to determine whether loss of _PROTEIN_ affects the organization and dynamics of the actin _LOCATION_ in the pollen tube . pollen tubes derived from wild type and _PROTEIN_ plants were subjected to f actin staining with alexa phalloidin . no overt defects in actin organization were detected in _PROTEIN_ pollen tubes compared with wild type pollen tubes . however we did note that the _METHOD_ associated with f actin staining was brighter in _PROTEIN_ pollen tubes compared with wild type pollen tubes . to quantitatively analyze this phenotype we focused on the shank region and subapical region because the f actin staining in shank region was quite uniform in both wild type and _PROTEIN_ pollen tubes and because adf was implicated in regulating the construction of actin structures in subapical regions . analysis of the distribution of _METHOD_ pixel intensities revealed that larger intensity values were more frequent in _PROTEIN_ pollen tubes compared with wild type pollen tubes . consequently the average _METHOD_ pixel intensity was significantly increased in the shanks and subapexes of _PROTEIN_ pollen tubes compared with that of wild type pollen tubes . since phalloidin specifically binds to f actin _METHOD_ intensity is positively correlated with the amount of f actin . thus the data suggest that loss of _PROTEIN_ increases the amount of f actin . furthermore measurement of skewness revealed that these values were significantly increased in _PROTEIN_ pollen tubes along with the measurement showed that the average width of filamentous structures increased in _PROTEIN_ pollen tubes suggesting that the extent of filament bundling was increased in _PROTEIN_ pollen tubes . however no overt differences were observed in the organization or amount of f actin in pollen grains from _PROTEIN_ plants compared with wild type plants . thus these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ regulates pollen tube growth by promoting disassembly of actin filaments . we next examined whether the organization and dynamics of actin filaments were differentially affected by actin targeted drugs in _PROTEIN_ pollen . we approached this question by analyzing the effects of the actin monomer sequestering agent latrunculin b on pollen germination and tube growth . results from this analysis revealed that germination of _PROTEIN_ pollen was resistant to treatment with nm latb compared with both wild type and _PROTEIN_ pollen . further analysis of a series of latb concentrations further confirmed that the germination of _PROTEIN_ pollen was resistant to latb . this phenotype was fully reversed in _PROTEIN_ plants . because nm latb was previously shown to result in half maximum growth inhibition of wild type arabidopsis pollen tubes and was associated with latb resistance in _PROTEIN_ plants two latb concentrations were selected for further analysis of the effects of latb on _PROTEIN_ pollen tube elongation . the average pollen tube elongation rates for wild type and _PROTEIN_ plants were normalized to . addition of and nm latb to standard germination medium reduced pollen tube elongation rates to and for wild type pollen tubes and and for _PROTEIN_ pollen tubes respectively . thus these data suggest that loss of _PROTEIN_ renders both pollen germination and tube elongation resistant to latb . we next visualized the effect of latb on the actin _LOCATION_ of the pollen grain since it has been shown to be a good experimental system for visualization of actin filaments and quantification of f actin . pollen grains were stained with alexa phalloidin after treatment with nm latb for min . actin filaments became fragmented in both wild type and _PROTEIN_ pollen grains treated with latb and were less abundant compared with untreated wild type and _PROTEIN_ pollen grains consistent with previous reports demonstrating net actin depolymerization induced by latb . however actin filaments in _PROTEIN_ pollen grains appeared brighter than those of wild type pollen grains after latb treatment . to assess this difference the relative amount of f actin was quantified by measuring the average _METHOD_ pixel intensity associated with f actin staining as described previously . the amount of f actin in untreated wild type and _PROTEIN_ pollen grains was normalized to . the relative amount of f actin was determined to be and for latb treated wild type and _PROTEIN_ pollen grains respectively . these observations suggest that loss of _PROTEIN_ results in stabilization of actin filaments implicating _PROTEIN_ in promotion of actin turnover . to determine the biochemical basis for the function of _PROTEIN_ recombinant _PROTEIN_ was produced and its activity was compared with the well characterized _PROTEIN_ protein . although some adf/cofilins have been shown to bind adp g actin and _PROTEIN_ g actin with equal affinity such as _PROTEIN_ adf and mouse cofilin most adf/cofilins have been shown to prefer adp g actin over _PROTEIN_ g actin . _PROTEIN_ quenched the _METHOD_ of both chloro nitrobenzo oxa diazole adp g actin and nbd _PROTEIN_ g actin but to a lesser degree than _PROTEIN_ . similar to _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ preferentially bound adp actin . _PROTEIN_ also inhibited nucleotide exchange on adp g actin under physiological conditions but this activity was less potent than that of _PROTEIN_ . these data suggest that _PROTEIN_ is a typical adf . as expected it promotes actin depolymerization and enhances the actin turnover rate . however these effects were weaker than those of _PROTEIN_ . the depolymerizing activity of _PROTEIN_ was further confirmed by visualizing its effect on shortening of actin filaments . _PROTEIN_ reduced the length of actin filaments in a dose dependent manner but to a lesser degree than _PROTEIN_ . to distinguish whether the filament shortening effect was a result of monomer dissociation filament severing or both we directly visualized single filaments using time lapse total internal reflection _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ microscopy . in the absence of adf proteins few breaks were observed along actin filaments . by contrast the addition of _PROTEIN_ resulted in increased filament breakage . both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ severed filaments in a dose dependent manner although _PROTEIN_ was less effective than _PROTEIN_ . we also measured monomer off rate in the absence or presence of adf proteins and found that both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ enhanced monomer dissociation from the pointed ends of actin filaments . again _PROTEIN_ was less efficient than _PROTEIN_ . thus these data suggest that _PROTEIN_ is a typical adf but that its activity is weaker than that of _PROTEIN_ . to determine where _PROTEIN_ is localized to the pollen tube we generated n terminal c terminal and several intramolecular _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion constructs according to published methods . _PROTEIN_ of these constructs was driven by the native _PROTEIN_ promoter . _PROTEIN_ transcript levels were restored in transgenic plants carrying each of the different _METHOD_ fusion constructs . among these lines only _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fully rescued the latb resistant germination and tube elongation phenotypes indicating that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ is functional and faithfully represents the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ in pollen . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ decorated actin filaments throughout the pollen grain . in pollen tubes of different lengths it primarily decorated actin cables in the shank region and the _METHOD_ signal was quite dim in the apical and subapical regions . we also examined the subcellular distribution patterns of other _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion proteins revealing that these proteins did not localize to obvious filamentous structures in either pollen grains or tubes . together these data suggest that _PROTEIN_ decorates longitudinal actin cables in pollen tubes . to explore the mechanism by which _PROTEIN_ regulates the dynamics of longitudinal actin cables in the pollen tube actin filaments were labeled with _METHOD_ lifeact which has previously been shown to decorate actin filaments in the pollen tube . to determine the underlying changes in single actin filaments dynamics we initially wanted to define the properties for single actin filaments by determining their _METHOD_ pixel intensities and widths . we found that the _METHOD_ pixel intensity positively correlates with the width for all measured filaments and some filamentous structures with smaller intensity values form a population with the intensity peak at . the filamentous structures within this population with intensity values below were assumed to be single filaments and were selected from _PROTEIN_ and wild type pollen tubes for further analysis . several dynamic parameters associated with single filaments were determined to see whether _PROTEIN_ contributes to the turnover of single filaments in shanks and subapexes . filament severing and depolymerization events were traced and quantified . severing frequency was significantly _PROTEIN_ in shanks and subapexes of _PROTEIN_ pollen tubes compared with that of wild type pollen tubes . additionally the depolymerization rate was significantly _PROTEIN_ in the shanks of _PROTEIN_ pollen tubes whereas no obvious difference was detected in subapexes of _PROTEIN_ pollen tubes compared with wild type pollen tubes . consequently the maximum filament lifetime significantly increased in shanks and subapexes of _PROTEIN_ pollen tubes whereas no obvious difference was detected in maximum filament length of _PROTEIN_ pollen tubes compared with wild type pollen tubes . additionally we found that the elongation rate of actin filaments was significantly _PROTEIN_ in the shanks of _PROTEIN_ pollen tubes whereas no obvious difference was detected in the subapexes of _PROTEIN_ pollen tubes compared with wild type pollen tubes . at the moment it is not clear why loss of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ the elongation rate of actin filaments in shanks . previous results showed that loss of _PROTEIN_ has differential effects on actin elongation in the epidermal cells from d old seedlings and and d old seedlings . thus these data suggest that _PROTEIN_ promotes actin turnover by severing filaments and promoting monomer dissociation . we next determined whether _PROTEIN_ contributes to the bundling and debundling events of actin filaments . we tried to trace the process of actin bundles formation and deformation . as shown in figure two adjacent actin bundles were zipped together to generate the heavy bundle in wild type pollen tubes which was supported by the measurement showing that the _METHOD_ pixel intensity increased while they were zipped together . we also noted that the heavy actin bundles can split into two small actin bundles . we next quantified the parameters associated with actin bundles dynamics in shanks . surprisingly we found that no obvious difference in bundling frequency was detected in _PROTEIN_ pollen tubes whereas debundling frequency significantly _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ pollen tubes compared with wild type pollen tubes . therefore the _PROTEIN_ in debundling frequency may at least partially account for the increase in the extent of filament bundling in _PROTEIN_ pollen tubes . considering that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion proteins act differentially in vivo careful documentation of their biochemical activities in combination with meaningful comparisons can provide insight into specific _METHOD_ of action of _PROTEIN_ in vivo . in addition to _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ we selected another intramolecular fusion protein _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ to perform the in vitro biochemical analysis . results from f actin high speed cosedimentation experiments revealed that glutathione s transferase _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ binds to f actin better than _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein had slightly less severing activity than _PROTEIN_ although no significant difference was detected . by contrast no severing activity was detected for _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . however both _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ bind g actin as well as _PROTEIN_ . thus these data suggest that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ retains levels of filament severing and g actin binding activity comparable to the wild type protein . by contrast though _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ retains g actin binding activity it is deficient in filament severing . therefore our data provide compelling evidence that the severing activity of _PROTEIN_ is vital for its function in vivo .
arabidopsis plants were grown in a culture room at under a h h dark cycle . to complement the phenotypes associated with _PROTEIN_ a kb genomic dna fragment harboring the _PROTEIN_ coding sequence was amplified from arabidopsis wild type col genomic dna using the primer pair . the sequence of the cloned fragment was confirmed by dna sequencing and the fragment was subcloned into vector cut with smai sali to yield the complementation construct . the resulting construct was subsequently transformed into _PROTEIN_ to generate the transgenic plants designated as _PROTEIN_ . to investigate _PROTEIN_ transcript levels open flowers with mature pollens were collected . total rna was extracted using trizol reagent and cdna was synthesized using m mlv according to the manufacturer s instructions . _PROTEIN_ transcript levels were compared between wild type _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ plants by amplifying a fragment using the primer pair . to determine the levels of _PROTEIN_ transcripts in transgenic plants harboring different _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion constructs two rounds of rt pcr were performed . initially the relative amounts of _PROTEIN_ transcripts between the transgenic plants were assessed by amplifying _METHOD_ using the primer pair . subsequently _PROTEIN_ transcripts were amplified from transgenic plants harboring n terminal and c terminal _METHOD_ fusion constructs using primer pairs and . these levels were compared with the relative amount of _PROTEIN_ transcripts in wild type plants amplified using the primer pair . was amplified using primer pair as the internal control for normalization . the bands on agarose gel were stained with ethidium bromide photographed and compared by densitometry using imagej software . pollen grains were cultured at on solid pollen gm as previously described . to determine the pollen germination rate pollen grains were germinated on solid gm for min . pollen grains were subsequently observed under an olympus microscope equipped with a objective and images were acquired using a retiga exi fast charge coupled device camera with image pro _PROTEIN_ software . more than pollen grains were counted for germination rate analysis per experiment and each experiment was repeated five times for each genotype . to determine the effect of latb on pollen germination various concentrations of latb were included in the solid gm . to determine the pollen tube growth rate images of elongating pollen tubes were captured after germination for and min on gm . the average lengths of the pollen tubes at min was subtracted from that at min to obtain the average increase in length which was then divided by the time interval to yield the average tube growth rate . more than pollen tubes were chosen for tube elongation rate analysis for each experiment and five and three independent experiments were performed for each genotype in the absence and presence of latb respectively . several _METHOD_ fusion constructs were generated to assess the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ . initially a kb genomic dna fragment containing the promoter untranslated region and coding region of _PROTEIN_ was amplified using the primer pair as described by citation . this fragment was subsequently used as the template to amplify two consecutive upstream and downstream fragments allowing for the fusion of _METHOD_ between them . the construct with _METHOD_ fused after _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was made exactly as described by citation . selection of the location of the _METHOD_ insertion for several other _PROTEIN_ intramolecular fusion constructs was performed based on studies by citation . briefly the structure of _PROTEIN_ was first generated using the structure of yeast cofilin as the template . we performed a structural alignment with yeast cofilin in order to select amino acids of _PROTEIN_ corresponding to the previously described _METHOD_ fusion with yeast cofilin . the selected amino acids were ile thr asp glu asn and cys in _PROTEIN_ . the primers used to generate the constructs are shown in supplemental table online . actin filaments in pollen grains and tubes were stained with alexa phalloidin as previously described . to determine the effect of latb on the actin _LOCATION_ pollen grains were treated with nm latb for min and the actin _LOCATION_ was visualized by staining with alexa phalloidin . to observe the actin _LOCATION_ in pollen tubes pollen grains were germinated for min at on solid gm and were subsequently subjected to fixation and staining with alexa phalloidin . actin filaments were observed with a confocal laser scanning microscope equipped with a oil objective . the _METHOD_ phalloidin was excited with the nm line of an argon laser and optical sections were collected with a step size of for both pollen grains and tubes . the images shown are projections from all optical sections . the architecture of actin _LOCATION_ was analyzed within different regions of pollen tubes . the regions to to and more than away from the tip were defined as apex subapex and shank respectively . the relative amount of actin filaments in pollen grains or tubes was quantified by measuring the _METHOD_ pixel intensity using imagej software . skewness of actin filament staining was analyzed as described by citation . the width of filamentous structures was determined roughly according to the method described by citation . for a particular filamentous structure three vertical lines were drawn across it to obtain three values of width of _METHOD_ pixel intensity at the half height and the final value of width for the particular filament was yielded by averaging them . to avoid repetitive counting three or four optical sections were excluded between sections used for analysis in each pollen tube . actin filaments were labeled with _METHOD_ lifeact _PROTEIN_ under control of the promoter in pollen tubes as previously described by citation . pollen grains were cultured at on solid pollen gm for h until the average length of the pollen tubes was and were observed under an olympus inverted microscope equipped with a universal plan super apochromat objective objective . actin filaments were imaged using a spinning disk confocal microscope equipped with a yokogawa csu spinning disk head . images were collected with a andor ixon electron multiplying ccd camera every s. _METHOD_ was excited with a nm laser and the emitted _METHOD_ was collected using a nm band pass filter . to measure the dynamic parameters associated with single filaments turnover we initially defined properties for them . we randomly hand selected more than filamentous actin structures from wild type pollen tubes to measure their _METHOD_ pixel intensity and width . the _METHOD_ pixel intensity of each filamentous structure was determined by drawing a line along it using the measure tool in imagej and the average _METHOD_ pixel intensity was calculated in kaleidagraph . the kernel density of _METHOD_ pixel intensity distribution was processed using r programming language as previously described . the width of filamentous structures was determined as described above . the filamentous structures with smaller intensity values form a population and are assumed to be single filaments . the filamentous structures with intensity values fall within this population from wild type and _PROTEIN_ pollen tubes were selected for further analysis . for analyzing the stochastic dynamic parameters related to single filament turnover only filaments longer than and existing for more than s were selected . severing frequency maximum filament length maximum filament lifetime . and elongation and depolymerization rate were determined and calculated roughly as previously described . briefly the severing frequency was determined by counting all severing events from the filament reaching its maximum length to its disappearance . if a filament regrew after breaking the length before breaking was taken as its maximum length and the time before breaking was taken as the valid time . the longest length of a tracked filament during its growth and shrinking was taken as the maximum filament length . maximum filament life time was defined as the elapsed time for a filament from its appearance to its disappearance . filament elongation and depolymerization rates were calculated as the changes of length versus the time intervals in excel . only filaments continuously growing or shrinking for at least s were taken into account . to analyze the bundling and debundling frequency in shanks of pollen tubes we selected a region that was away from the tip to perform the analysis . the dynamics of actin bundles in this region was tracked in a consecutive s and analyzed . the bundling and debundling frequencies were defined as the number of these events per unit area per unit time . total rna was isolated from flowers of wild type _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ plants using trizol reagent and the corresponding cdna was subsequently synthesized using m mlv according to the manufacturer s instructions . since the cdss of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ share nucleotide identity one primer pair derived from the _PROTEIN_ untranslated region was used to specifically amplify _PROTEIN_ cdna using wild type cdna as the template . the resulting product was subsequently used as the template to amplify the cds of _PROTEIN_ using the primer pair . after verification of the correct sequence by dna sequencing analysis the _PROTEIN_ cds was subcloned into the pgex kg vector to generate the pgex kg _PROTEIN_ construct . similarly the cdss for _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were amplified using primer pair and cdna derived from _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ as templates . the resulting products were verified by sequencing and subcloned into pgex kg cut with ecori ncoi to produce the pgex kg _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and pgex kg _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ constructs . the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ cds and the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ cds were also amplified with primer pair verified by dna sequencing and subcloned into the vector cut with ndei hindiii to generate the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ constructs . because _METHOD_ interferes with the nbd actin binding assay due to overlap of the wavelengths associated with absorption and emission of _METHOD_ and nbd we eliminated this effect by deleting three key amino acids within the fluorophore center of _METHOD_ . thus the plasmids _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were used as templates to generate the mutant constructs _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ respectively using primer pair . to generate recombinant proteins these _PROTEIN_ constructs were transformed into the escherichia coli strain . _PROTEIN_ of these recombinant proteins was induced by the addition of mm isopropyl d thiogalactopyranoside followed by incubation at for h. cells were harvested by centrifugation at for min and lysed by sonication . _PROTEIN_ fusion proteins were purified using glutathione sepharose resin according to the manufacturer s recommended protocol . to produce _PROTEIN_ lacking a tag _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was digested with thrombin overnight at to cleave _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ was further purified by q sepharose chromatography . after loading onto a q sepharose column _PROTEIN_ was eluted with elution buffer after extensive washing with wash buffer . the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion proteins were purified with nickel nitriloacetic acid resin according to the manufacturer s instructions . all purified proteins were dialyzed against mm tris hcl ph flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at . _PROTEIN_ was purified as described by citation . actin was purified from rabbit skeletal muscle acetone powder as previously described and monomeric _PROTEIN_ actin was purified using sephacryl s chromatography in buffer g _PROTEIN_ at . a high speed cosedimentation assay was _PROTEIN_ from previously published methods . all proteins including g actin were preclarified at for min at . actin filaments were incubated with increasing concentrations of _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ or a constant concentration of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . after incubation for min at the reaction mixtures were centrifuged at for min at . fractions containing the supernatants and pellets were resolved by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and the gels were stained with _METHOD_ brilliant blue r . the amount of actin in the supernatant or pellet was quantified by densitometry using imagej . actin was incubated at for min in polymerization buffer _PROTEIN_ . the resulting actin filaments were then incubated with varying concentrations of _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ for min . an equimolar amount of rhodamine phalloidin was then added to label actin filaments and stop the reaction as described by citation . finally actin filaments were diluted to nm with _METHOD_ buffer . a sample of of the actin filament mixture was then placed on a mm cover slip coated with poly l lys . actin filaments were visualized by _METHOD_ illumination under an olympus microscope equipped with a oil objective . images were captured using a retiga exi fast ccd camera with image pro _PROTEIN_ software . the length of individual actin filaments was quantified using imagej . all proteins and buffers were clarified by centrifugation at for min at prior to the assay . actin was polymerized at for h in polymerization buffer . the resulting actin filaments were then incubated with varying concentrations of _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ in kmei . the absorbance associated with light scattering was monitored for min using a quantamaster luminescence qm ph fluorometer with both emission and excitation wavelengths set at nm . actin was labeled with _PROTEIN_ succinimidyl ester and the flow cell was prepared as previously described . the flow cell was incubated with nm n ethylmaleimide myosin for min followed by washing with bsa for min . it was next injected with _PROTEIN_ microscopy buffer _PROTEIN_ . actin filaments were injected into the chamber and the mixture was incubated for min in the dark . finally the flow cell was washed with _PROTEIN_ microscopy buffer to remove free actin filaments that were not attached to nem myosin . single actin filaments were observed by _PROTEIN_ illumination with an olympus microscope equipped with a oil objective . images were collected for min with an interval of or s using a photometrics cascade ii ccd camera with micromanager software . to determine the filament severing activity of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ varying concentrations of these proteins were injected into the chamber in _PROTEIN_ microscopy buffer . the filament severing frequency was defined as as previously reported . more than actin filaments with lengths > were selected for quantification of actin filament severing frequency . the monomer dissociation rate was determined assuming length filament equals subunits . the definition for the pointed end and barbed end of each measured filament in the absence or presence of adf proteins was according to the description by citation . g actin binding activity of _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ was determined by measuring the _PROTEIN_ in _METHOD_ of nbd labeled actin . nbd g actin was prepared as previously described . nbd _PROTEIN_ actin or nbd adp actin was prepared as described by citation . for the preparation of nbd _PROTEIN_ g actin nbd actin was incubated with mm _PROTEIN_ for min at in the dark . for the preparation of nbd adp g actin nbd actin was incubated with units/ml of hexokinase and mm glc for h at in the dark . nbd _PROTEIN_ g actin or nbd adp g actin was then incubated with increasing concentrations of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in mm and mm kcl . the change in nbd _METHOD_ was analyzed for s using a quantamaster luminescence qm ph fluorometer with the excitation and emission wavelengths set to and nm respectively . the resulting data were fitted using kaleidagraph with the following equations where q/qmax qmax is the maximum _METHOD_ quenching caused by the saturation of g actin bound to adf is the total concentration of adf is the total concentration of g actin and kd is the equilibrium dissociation constant of the g actin adf complex . the rate of g actin nucleotide exchange was determined by measuring the increase in _METHOD_ upon binding of ethenoadenosine triphosphate _PROTEIN_ . the experiment was performed as described by citation . briefly adp actin in buffer g lacking _PROTEIN_ was incubated with tris/nacl buffer alone or containing _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ . next _PROTEIN_ was added to the solution . the reaction was monitored using a quantamaster luminescence qm ph fluorometer for a minimum of min with the excitation and emission wavelengths set at and nm respectively . the actin filament turnover rate was quantified as previously described . _METHOD_ labeled adp actin filaments were preassembled from _PROTEIN_ actin subunits and the turnover rate was determined by measuring the change in _METHOD_ caused by exchange of adp for _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . g actin was prepared as previously described and g actin was assembled in the presence of in kmei . subsequently actin filaments were incubated with _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ for min in kmei . the change in the _METHOD_ at was analyzed after the addition of mm _PROTEIN_ using a quantamaster luminescence qm ph fluorometer . the excitation and emission wavelengths were and nm respectively . sequence alignment was performed using the online software program clustalw . the resulting data
