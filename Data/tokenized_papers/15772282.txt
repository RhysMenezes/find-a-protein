copper delivery to the _LOCATION_ lumen protein plastocyanin and the stromal enzyme cu/zn superoxide dismutase in chloroplasts is required for photosynthesis and oxidative stress protection . the copper delivery system in chloroplasts was characterized by analyzing the function of copper transporter genes in arabidopsis thaliana . two mutant alleles were identified of a previously uncharacterized gene _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ which is required for efficient photosynthetic electron transport . _PROTEIN_ encodes a copper transporting p type _PROTEIN_ with sequence similarity to _PROTEIN_ which functions in copper transport in chloroplasts . both proteins localized to the chloroplast as indicated by fusions to green _METHOD_ protein . the _PROTEIN_ fusions were found in the chloroplast periphery whereas _PROTEIN_ fusions were localized in _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . the phenotypes of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants indicated that the two transporters have distinct functions whereas both transporters are required for copper delivery to plastocyanin copper delivery to the stroma is inhibited only in _PROTEIN_ but not in _PROTEIN_ . the effects of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ on superoxide dismutase isoform _PROTEIN_ levels suggest that stromal copper levels regulate _PROTEIN_ of the _LOCATION_ genes iron _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . a _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant was seedling lethal underscoring the importance of copper to photosynthesis . we propose that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ function sequentially in copper transport over the envelope and _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ respectively .
plants with even subtle defects in photosynthetic electron transport may display a high chlorophyll _METHOD_ phenotype which can be detected using an imaging system . to obtain novel mutants with a defect in photosynthesis seedlings derived by mutagenesis with ethyl methanesulfonate were screened for a high _METHOD_ phenotype at a light intensity of . among the arabidopsis mutants isolated were two novel mutants _PROTEIN_ designated _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . except for the high chlorophyll _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ mutants did not exhibit any visible phenotype on regular soil . genetic analysis revealed that the phenotype of both mutants was attributable to a recessive mutation in a single _LOCATION_ gene . plants resulting from a cross between the two mutants displayed the high chlorophyll _METHOD_ indicating that the two mutants were allelic . to identify the gene responsible for the high chlorophyll _METHOD_ phenotype _PROTEIN_ was crossed to a polymorphic wild type strain _LOCATION_ and the mutation was mapped between molecular markers and on chromosome . fine mapping using plants identified a kb region covered by two bac clones and . because we expected the chlorophyll _METHOD_ phenotype to be associated with a chloroplast function the genomic sequences of candidate genes encoding putative chloroplast targeted proteins within the kb region were determined and compared between mutants and wild type plants . sequence alterations were found in a single gene with the arabidopsis genome initiative number _GENE_ in both alleles . to verify that _GENE_ is responsible for the mutant phenotype the genomic sequence containing a single gene the wild type _GENE_ was introduced into _PROTEIN_ . the transformation complemented the chlorophyll _METHOD_ phenotype _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . we conclude that the high _METHOD_ phenotype was attributable to lesions in _GENE_ . _GENE_ encodes a putative metal transporting p type _PROTEIN_ and is most similar to _PROTEIN_ which encodes a cu transporting p type _PROTEIN_ in chloroplasts . therefore we designated _GENE_ as _PROTEIN_ and the two mutant alleles as _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . a nonsense mutation was found in the second exon in _PROTEIN_ suggesting that _PROTEIN_ is effectively a null allele . the mutation in _PROTEIN_ is a nucleotide substitution at the predicted junction between the second intron and the third exon from the consensus _PROTEIN_ into aa . sequencing of rt pcr products revealed that a downstream _PROTEIN_ in the third exon was used for splicing in the transcripts detected in _PROTEIN_ . the resulting frame shift should cause the premature termination of translation . thus based on sequence analysis it is predicted that both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are null alleles . however we can not exclude the possibility that _PROTEIN_ may be leaky because an alternative splicing mechanism in _PROTEIN_ may produce a minor so far undetected form of mrna that could be translated into an at least partially functional protein . a cdna for the _PROTEIN_ coding sequence was obtained by rt pcr and sequence analysis clarified that the exons of _GENE_ were incorrectly assigned in the munich information center for protein sequences and the arabidopsis information resource databases . the first two predicted exons were not interrupted by an intron in the cdna sequence . thus _PROTEIN_ consists of exons and introns . the amino acid sequence of _PROTEIN_ with a correctly assigned exon shows amino acid identity with the _PROTEIN_ sequence . like _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is predicted to encode a precursor protein with a cleavable n terminal chloroplast transit sequence . analysis of the predicted sequence of _PROTEIN_ suggests that it encodes an integral _LOCATION_ protein with eight possible transmembrane regions and that has all of the characteristic conserved domains of the cu transporting p type _PROTEIN_ found in various _METHOD_ . the conserved domains include a mxcxxc consensus metal binding motif in the n terminal region a _PROTEIN_ ion transduction domain in the sixth predicted transmembrane domain a phosphorylation domain and an _PROTEIN_ binding domain in a large soluble domain loop between transmembrane domains and and a phosphatase domain in a smaller loop . relative to _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ lacks a gly rich region that follows the transit sequence cleavage site and the hydrophobicity of the first two transmembrane regions of _PROTEIN_ is reduced . the high chlorophyll _METHOD_ of _PROTEIN_ suggests that photosynthetic electron transport was affected as was the case for _PROTEIN_ . quantitative analysis of chlorophyll _METHOD_ enables us to monitor the status of photosynthetic electron transport in vivo . to determine quantitatively whether there are defects in photosynthetic electron transport we measured the relative rate of photosystem ii electron transport as a function of light intensity . figure shows that the electron transport was affected in the _PROTEIN_ alleles even at relatively low light intensities and that it was saturated at of the maximum electron transport in the wild type . introduction of the wild type _PROTEIN_ sequence into _PROTEIN_ complemented the electron transport phenotype _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . for comparison we measured the electron transport in a _PROTEIN_ mutant in the same col background . in _PROTEIN_ electron transport was saturated at lower light intensity and reached a much lower level than in _PROTEIN_ mutants . we conclude that electron transport is impaired in _PROTEIN_ although the effect is rather mild compared with that in _PROTEIN_ . this observation is consistent with the difference in growth rates on soil between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ as estimated from seedling size . _PROTEIN_ has sequence similarity to genes encoding cu transporting p type _PROTEIN_ and mutations in _PROTEIN_ affect photosynthetic electron transport . to investigate whether the observed phenomena result from defects in cu delivery we tested the effects of cu feeding on the phenotype of _PROTEIN_ . two alleles of _PROTEIN_ and for comparison one allele of _PROTEIN_ and the wild type were cultured on solid agar medium with varying concentrations of . photosynthetic electron transport activity was estimated from the chlorophyll _METHOD_ parameter . chlorophyll content was also determined because it is a good indicator of sensitivity to cu . consistent with the reduction of electron transport in the seedlings cultured on soil was affected in both alleles of _PROTEIN_ on standard _METHOD_ medium containing . the phenotype of _PROTEIN_ was more severe than that of _PROTEIN_ particularly on medium with very low cu . as mentioned above leakiness is a possibility in _PROTEIN_ and this may explain the difference between the mutant alleles of _PROTEIN_ . again there was a stronger reduction in in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . addition of restored and chlorophyll content in _PROTEIN_ as reported previously . the _PROTEIN_ phenotypes were also suppressed by growth on or . by contrast limitation of cu availability further enhanced the phenotypes in both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . the effect of cu on chlorophyll content was not as strong as on but the same trends were apparent . thus the _PROTEIN_ phenotype depends on cu availability but compared with _PROTEIN_ the effect of cu is reduced . tolerance to excess cu is a reported function of some cu transporting p type _PROTEIN_ . the cu concentration of is in the toxic range for arabidopsis at which visible growth defects such as reduced shoot size and root length are observed . this high cu concentration affected both and chlorophyll content in the wild type . was comparable between the mutants and the wild type whereas the chlorophyll content of _PROTEIN_ alleles was only slightly lower than those of the wild type and _PROTEIN_ indicating that the sensitivity of arabidopsis to this toxic level of cu is not drastically affected in _PROTEIN_ similar to _PROTEIN_ . in vitro import experiments with pea chloroplasts have shown that the n terminus of the _PROTEIN_ precursor contains chloroplast targeting information . the photosynthetic electron transport defect of _PROTEIN_ mutants suggested that the _PROTEIN_ protein is required for cu delivery to plastocyanin in the _LOCATION_ lumen but to get to this location cu must cross several _LOCATION_ . the targetp program predicted a chloroplast localization in the case of _PROTEIN_ and a cleavable transit sequence of amino acids . to examine the subcellular localization of the transporters we constructed fusions with green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ . the coding regions for the predicted chloroplast transit sequences of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were fused to _METHOD_ . both transit sequence _METHOD_ fusion constructs were _PROTEIN_ from a constitutive promoter in green arabidopsis protoplast derived cells . _METHOD_ alone _PROTEIN_ from the same promoter was used as a control . because chloroplast transit sequences effectively mediate the translocation of a passenger protein across the envelope the expected location for a _METHOD_ fusion to a transit sequence is the stroma . the localization in cells was analyzed using confocal laser microscopy . _METHOD_ corresponding to _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ without a transit sequence was excluded from the chloroplasts as expected and comparison with bright field images indicated that _METHOD_ was localized in the cytoplasm and in the _LOCATION_ . by contrast green _METHOD_ from the _PROTEIN_ transit sequence _METHOD_ fusion and the _PROTEIN_ transit sequence _METHOD_ fusion localized to the chloroplast as indicated by the overlay of green _METHOD_ and red _METHOD_ . these results indicate that the n terminal sequences of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ function as chloroplast targeting sequences . therefore the transporter proteins should function in the chloroplast either in the inner envelope _LOCATION_ or in the _LOCATION_ . for _PROTEIN_ protein an envelope location had already been inferred from phenotypic analysis but its location had not been demonstrated directly in intact cells . to investigate directly in which _LOCATION_ system _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ may function we attempted to _PROTEIN_ full length fusions with _METHOD_ . in contrast with the result obtained with the transit sequence fusion the green _METHOD_ in cells _PROTEIN_ the full length _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion was localized to the periphery of chloroplasts consistent with localization in the envelope . because _PROTEIN_ of the full length fusion of _PROTEIN_ to _METHOD_ never resulted in sufficient _METHOD_ signal we could not localize the full length _PROTEIN_ . however because topogenic information for _LOCATION_ insertion may be contained in the first few transmembrane domains we constructed additional fusions to _METHOD_ . to include the n terminal parts of the precursor with the first and second predicted transmembrane regions residues to of _PROTEIN_ were fused to _METHOD_ . for _PROTEIN_ residues to including the first four predicted transmembrane domains were fused to _METHOD_ . the localization results for these fusions are shown in figures and . green _METHOD_ in cells _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion was localized to the periphery of chloroplasts consistent with the localization of the full precursor fusion . this result indicates that envelope targeting information for _PROTEIN_ is contained in the first two transmembrane domains . interestingly the location of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion seemed to overlap with the _LOCATION_ and no labeling of the chloroplast periphery was seen . these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ is not targeted to the envelope but instead may be targeted to the _LOCATION_ . to investigate localization by a different approach we performed in vitro import experiments using isolated chloroplasts and in vitro translation of synthetic mrna to obtain radiolabeled precursor proteins . with this method we did not succeed in the in vitro translation of full length _PROTEIN_ as was the case for full length _PROTEIN_ . however after we introduced a stop codon that follows the codon for residue we did observe translation resulting in a truncated precursor of the predicted size of kd . this precursor includes the first four transmembrane domains . we analyzed the location of this protein by fractionation of the chloroplasts after in vitro import . we used the plastocyanin precursor as a control . the fractionation shows that the truncated _PROTEIN_ precursor is imported resulting in a mature sized protein after transit sequence fusion . the imported truncated _PROTEIN_ protein is protected from thermolysin protease treatment in the intact chloroplasts and fractionates with the _LOCATION_ fraction in which it is susceptible to protease treatment as would be expected for a _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ protein . the control plastocyanin localizes to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ fraction in which it is fully protected from protease treatment . to further investigate the suborganellar localization of truncated _PROTEIN_ the intact chloroplasts after thermolysin protease treatment were lysed and fractionated on a sucrose step gradient . the radiolabeled imported protein was detected in the _LOCATION_ fraction whereas no radioactive protein bands were detected in either stroma or envelope fractions . the separation and recovery of fractions was verified by immunoblotting using antibody markers specific for the stroma _LOCATION_ and inner envelope _LOCATION_ . we conclude from the data in figures and and data obtained previously for _PROTEIN_ that both the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ proteins are active in chloroplasts . the data indicate that _PROTEIN_ functions in the envelope whereas _PROTEIN_ is present in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . however even though the data clearly indicate that the majority of the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ proteins function in different _LOCATION_ within the chloroplast it can not be excluded that a minor fraction of _PROTEIN_ could also be active in the envelope or a minor fraction of _PROTEIN_ could also be active in the _LOCATION_ . a defect in _PROTEIN_ if the protein is active in the envelope should affect cu delivery to both the stroma and the _LOCATION_ . similarly a defect in _PROTEIN_ if the protein is active in _LOCATION_ should result in altered metal ion levels in the chloroplast stroma and _LOCATION_ lumen which in turn may explain the photosynthesis phenotype of _PROTEIN_ alleles . to analyze directly whether _PROTEIN_ is involved in cu delivery to chloroplast compartments we performed an elemental analysis of total leaf tissue and chloroplast fractions from wild type and _PROTEIN_ plants and for comparison _PROTEIN_ plants . we did not observe a significant difference in the content of cu fe or zn between leaves in wild type and _PROTEIN_ plants indicating that _PROTEIN_ function is not required for metal ion delivery from the soil to the leaf tissue . however a small but significant reduction was seen for the cu content of _PROTEIN_ relative to wild type plants . no significant differences were found for other measured elements in the leaf tissue among _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and the wild type . as was noted previously _PROTEIN_ chloroplasts had reduced cu content compared with wild type chloroplasts . even though the cu content of _PROTEIN_ chloroplasts was slightly lower than that of wild type chloroplasts this difference was not statistically significant . interestingly even though total cu levels were comparable between wild type and mutant leaf tissue there was a large reduction of cu content of the _LOCATION_ for both mutants compared with the wild type . whereas only a modest reduction was seen for cu in the intact chloroplast of _PROTEIN_ this line showed the most dramatic reduction of _LOCATION_ cu content . these results indicate that _PROTEIN_ has a role in cu delivery to _LOCATION_ . fe levels were slightly but significantly increased in the intact chloroplast and the _LOCATION_ of _PROTEIN_ . relative to the wild type zn levels were significantly increased in chloroplasts of both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ with the latter line showing the largest increase . because there was no significant increase in the zn levels of _LOCATION_ fractions the increases in chloroplast zn levels in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ may have been attributable to higher zn concentrations in the stroma . these results support the role of _PROTEIN_ as a chloroplast localized and most likely _LOCATION_ localized transporter specific for cu . metal ion profiles in leaf and chloroplast fractions two cu proteins play important roles in photosynthesis in arabidopsis . plastocyanin is active in the _LOCATION_ lumen and _PROTEIN_ is active in the stroma . to investigate the role of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ proteins in the biogenesis of these cu proteins we compared the abundance of plastocyanin and sod _METHOD_ in wild type and mutant plants . a native gel electrophoresis assay was used to distinguish holoplastocyanin and apoplastocyanin isolated from the _LOCATION_ lumen of wild type and _PROTEIN_ plants grown on soil . purified spinach plastocyanin which is very similar in sequence to arabidopsis plastocyanin was used to identify bands corresponding to untreated holoplastocyanin and apoplastocyanin obtained after ascorbate and kcn treatment . in wild type plants plastocyanin was present in both the holo and apo _METHOD_ . however a comparison of the staining intensities of both holoplastocyanin and apoplastocyanin on the control gel stained for total protein and the control immunoblot indicates that the antibody detects the apo form of plastocyanin with to fold better efficiency in this native gel assay . thus in wild type _LOCATION_ the majority of plastocyanin is the holo form . in contrast with the situation in wild type plants and similar to what was found previously for the _PROTEIN_ mutants plastocyanin was accumulated in the apo form in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants and holo protein was hardly detectable . apoplastocyanin in the _LOCATION_ lumen may be unstable as was found in chlamydomonas . indeed the total amount of detectable plastocyanin polypeptide after separation on a denaturing gel in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants was much less than that in the wild type . a quantification of the band intensities in figure and replicate experiments indicates greater than reduction of plastocyanin in both tested alleles of _PROTEIN_ and greater than reduction in both alleles of _PROTEIN_ for plants grown on soil . the deficiency of plastocyanin in _PROTEIN_ mutants indicates that cu delivery to the _LOCATION_ lumen is severely impaired which explains the observed defect in electron transport . the electron transport defect was rescued by cu feeding in both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants but a much larger effect of cu feeding was observed for _PROTEIN_ . to directly investigate the effects of cu feeding on plastocyanin levels plants were grown on _METHOD_ agar medium supplemented with different concentrations or with the cu chelator cuprizone . measurements of metal levels verified that cu feeding increased total shoot cu levels whereas cuprizone _PROTEIN_ shoot cu levels . because the results shown in figures and indicate that total plastocyanin levels are a good indicator of holoplastocyanin levels we analyzed plastocyanin in total leaf tissue by denaturing electrophoresis . as expected cu feeding or depletion affected plastocyanin levels in wild type plants indicating that this protein is an important sink for cu in green tissues as had been noted . however the addition of toxic levels of cu negatively affected plastocyanin accumulation in the wild type an effect that is paralleled by a _PROTEIN_ in chlorophyll and stunted plant growth . interestingly plastocyanin content was partially rescued in the _PROTEIN_ mutant by increasing concentrations . this result suggests the presence of a cu delivery pathway to plastocyanin which functions independently of _PROTEIN_ at high shoot cu levels . in contrast with what was observed for the wild type supplementation with a toxic amount of cu further increased the plastocyanin content in _PROTEIN_ . in the _PROTEIN_ mutants we observed only a marginal increase in plastocyanin content with increasing concentration and toxic amounts of cu further reduced plastocyanin levels . rna gel blot experiments indicated that plastocyanin transcription was not significantly affected by the cu treatments and was comparable in wild type and _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ plants . the difference in plastocyanin accumulation in response to cu between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ supports the notion that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ proteins function in different chloroplast _LOCATION_ . the quantitative analysis of the cu content in _PROTEIN_ suggest that _PROTEIN_ protein functions as a cu transporter in the _LOCATION_ . if this is the case _PROTEIN_ mutations should not have a negative effect on stromal cu enzymes such as _PROTEIN_ . to test this hypothesis we analyzed the activity of sod isozymes in leaf tissue from plants grown at different cu concentrations . the sod _METHOD_ can be distinguished by their mobility on native gels and sensitivity to inhibitors . the _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ activity increased with cu feeding in all plant lines but relative to wild type plants it was more pronounced in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . immunoblots and rna gel blots indicate that increased _PROTEIN_ activity can be ascribed to an increase in gene _PROTEIN_ . the activity of stromal _PROTEIN_ was not detectable on the standard _METHOD_ growth medium in the wild type but was detected in plants after cu feeding . interestingly increased _PROTEIN_ activity was observed for _PROTEIN_ compared with wild type plants at all cu concentrations but the difference was especially clear at low cu concentrations . in _PROTEIN_ no _PROTEIN_ activity was observed for plants grown on _METHOD_ medium containing but as with plastocyanin very high cu levels partially restored _PROTEIN_ activity . as with _PROTEIN_ the increase in _PROTEIN_ activity in response to cu can be ascribed to an increase in gene _PROTEIN_ as increased _PROTEIN_ protein and mrna levels were observed with increased cu . quantification of the band intensities in figure indicates that in wild type _PROTEIN_ mrna levels are upregulated sevenfold at cu compared with cu . similarly _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is upregulated in _PROTEIN_ relative to the wild type at both the protein and mrna levels when grown on the standard _METHOD_ growth medium . by contrast the reduced _PROTEIN_ activity in _PROTEIN_ was not attributable to downregulation of gene _PROTEIN_ relative to the wild type the _PROTEIN_ mutant had higher _PROTEIN_ polypeptide and mrna levels at low cu levels . we conclude that in the _PROTEIN_ mutant the sod apoprotein which is reported to be stable accumulated in the stroma . thus the reduced activity of _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ is the result of a defect in cu delivery . to confirm the activity of _PROTEIN_ we analyzed sod activities in stromal fractions prepared from isolated chloroplasts . intactness of the chloroplasts was indicated by the quantitative recovery of the stromal enzyme _PROTEIN_ whereas purity was verified by the absence of the _LOCATION_ marker . analysis of the sod activity in stromal fractions confirmed the increased presence of _PROTEIN_ activity in _PROTEIN_ and the _PROTEIN_ activity in _PROTEIN_ . the impaired delivery of cu to the _LOCATION_ lumen protein plastocyanin together with an increase in the activity of the stromal cu/znsod in _PROTEIN_ mutants strongly suggests that _PROTEIN_ encodes a _LOCATION_ cu transporter . by contrast the observed defects in cu delivery to both stromal and lumenal chloroplast proteins suggest that _PROTEIN_ acts as a cu transporter in the envelope . the activity of mnsod was the same in wild type _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ plants under all conditions . however two interesting observations were made when examining stromal fesod activity . in wild type plants fesod activity was observed only on low cu medium and it was not detected in plants grown on cu supplemented medium . furthermore compared with the wild type we observed that stromal fesod activity was significantly reduced in _PROTEIN_ and slightly reduced in _PROTEIN_ . the absence of fesod activity at high cu and its reduction under low cu conditions in the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants relative to the wild type can be explained by a reduction of fesod polypeptide levels which in turn can be ascribed to reduced mrna levels . quantification of the data shown in figure demonstrated that on standard _METHOD_ medium fesod mrna levels were reduced sixfold in _PROTEIN_ compared with the wild type . in _PROTEIN_ this reduction was less than twofold . photosynthesis is similarly affected in both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants . _PROTEIN_ is localized in the _LOCATION_ envelope . on the other hand the phenotypic analysis of _PROTEIN_ suggests a localization in _LOCATION_ for _PROTEIN_ . thus we may expect _PROTEIN_ to be _PROTEIN_ in all tissues but _PROTEIN_ to be _PROTEIN_ only in green tissue in which the _LOCATION_ develop into chloroplasts that contain _LOCATION_ . we investigated the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mrna in root and shoot tissues by rt pcr because the mrna levels were too low to be detected on rna gel blots . _PROTEIN_ transcripts were detected in both shoot and root tissues although we observed a much higher _PROTEIN_ level in shoot tissue . on the other hand _PROTEIN_ transcripts were detected in the shoot only and no products were detected in the root . consistent with the localization data shown in figure these results suggest a role for _PROTEIN_ in both green and nongreen _LOCATION_ whereas _PROTEIN_ may function exclusively in green photosynthetically active chloroplasts . to analyze the phenotype of double mutants _PROTEIN_ was crossed with _PROTEIN_ . genotypes of the resulting progeny were analyzed by pcr using primers designed to detect the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutations . among the seedlings grown on soil we found no double mutant homozygous for both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . this result strongly suggests that the double mutant was lethal on soil . because photosynthetic electron transport may have been severely affected in the double mutant we tested the growth of the progeny of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ on medium supplemented with sucrose to rescue the defects in photosynthesis caused by lesions . we compared growth on the standard medium and _METHOD_ medium supplemented with which was sufficient to at least partially suppress the defects in the single mutants . on standard _METHOD_ medium containing _PROTEIN_ displayed a pale green leaf color and drastic reduction in growth rate . similarly _PROTEIN_ seedlings also displayed some chlorosis although the growth rate was unaffected . with mendelian segregation we expected one fourth of the offspring of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ to be homozygous for both recessive mutations . indeed seedlings with a growth phenotype that was much more severe than in either single mutant constituted approximately one quarter of the total population whereas the other seedlings displayed a phenotype characteristic of _PROTEIN_ . pcr amplification of the _PROTEIN_ sequence confirmed that seedlings with this severe phenotype were homozygous for the _PROTEIN_ allele . the cotyledons in the double mutant were severely chlorotic and true leaves did not emerge . the phenotypes were significantly more severe than those of _PROTEIN_ . this severe growth phenotype of the double mutant was evident in the light . in the dark however hypocotyl elongation and root growth were uniform among the progeny of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . on _METHOD_ medium supplemented with the phenotype of _PROTEIN_ was drastically weakened . by contrast the double mutants still displayed the severe growth phenotype and chlorosis . although supplementation of the toxic level of cu restored the leaf color the growth rate was still severely affected in the double mutant . we conclude that the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant is seedling lethal even on medium supplemented with sucrose .
the background of arabidopsis thaliana _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ is col . both alleles were derived by mutagenesis with ethyl methanesulfonate . the _PROTEIN_ alleles used in this study were _PROTEIN_ which is in the col background and _PROTEIN_ which is in the col background and have comparable phenotypes . plants were grown in metromix potting soil under controlled conditions . for chloroplast

sequencing kit and an abi prism sequencer . for complementation of the _PROTEIN_ mutation the kb fragment containing the wild type _PROTEIN_ sequence flanked by tctagatgtgttgtagaaga and aagcttcctccgttgtatcc was cloned in . the resulting plasmid was introduced into the agrobacterium tumefaciens strain and then transformed into _PROTEIN_ . total rna from root and shoot was isolated using _PROTEIN_ reagent . first strand cdna was synthesized from of treated total rna using moloney murine leukemia virus rt and oligo primers according to instructions . the expand polymerase enzyme kit was used to amplify the _PROTEIN_ coding sequence using the flanking primers smai n ter and xhoi c ter by pcr . the underlined sequences are the restriction sites . the amplified product was digested with smai and xhoi cloned into pbluescript _PROTEIN_ and sequenced by the dideoxy dye termination method . the cdna sequence was deposited in the genbank database with accession number . the _METHOD_ reporter plasmid _METHOD_ was generously provided by norbert rolland . construction of the plasmids for _PROTEIN_ of fusions to _METHOD_ was as follows . the transit sequence of _PROTEIN_ and the transit sequence of _PROTEIN_ were amplified by pcr using flanking primers sali n ter and ncoi c ter for _PROTEIN_ and sali n ter and ncoi c ter for _PROTEIN_ . the n terminal primers hybridize to the untranslated region . genomic dna was used as the template for pcr . pcr products were inserted into the sali ncoi digested _METHOD_ reporter plasmid to create _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . similarly the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion was constructed after pcr using primers _PROTEIN_ ter.sal _PROTEIN_ in combination with _PROTEIN_ . . the fusion of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was constructed after pcr using primers _PROTEIN_ ter.sal and _PROTEIN_ . the orientation was confirmed by restriction digestion and sequencing . for the latter two fusions cdna clones were used as templates for pcr . to make a fusion with _METHOD_ of the full length _PROTEIN_ the entire coding sequence was amplified by pcr using flanking primers _PROTEIN_ ter.sal and _PROTEIN_ rev sali . the pcr products was inserted into the sali digested _METHOD_ plasmid to create _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . the correct orientations of the insertion and fusion of full dna sequences were verified by sequencing using the dideoxy method . the plasmids used for protoplast transformation were prepared using the plasmid midi kit . construction of the plasmid for in vitro transcription of a truncated _PROTEIN_ was performed as follows . the _PROTEIN_ precursor sequence including the first four transmembrane domains was amplified by pcr using primers smai n ter and _PROTEIN_ . the amplified product was digested with smai and xhoi and cloned into pbluescript _PROTEIN_ . plasmid was linearized by kpni and in vitro transcribed using polymerase . the vector used for in vitro transcription of the plastocyanin sequence from silene pratensis was as described . _METHOD_ fusions were _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis protoplast derived cells from the promoter in the _METHOD_ reporter plasmid _METHOD_ . for protoplast preparation arabidopsis plants were grown on _METHOD_ medium for weeks . two _METHOD_ fresh weight of leaf tissue was suspended in ml of a buffer containing cellulase onozuka r macerozyme r mm m mannitol and mm mes ph vacuum infiltrated for min and incubated for h at room temperature with gentle shaking . the clear digest was filtered through a to nylon mesh and the protoplasts were harvested by centrifugation for min at rpm and washed twice in ml of wash solution _PROTEIN_ . the pellet was suspended in ml of mannitol/mg solution . protoplasts were counted using a hemocytometer and their concentration was adjusted to cells/ml with mannitol/mg solution . fifty _METHOD_ of plasmid dna of salmon sperm dna and of polyethylene glycol solution were added to of the protoplast solution very gently mixed and left for min at room temperature . the solution was very slowly diluted with ml of solution and then pelleted by centrifugation for min at rpm . protoplasts were further resuspended in ml of protoplast culture medium composed of _METHOD_ medium supplemented with m _PROTEIN_ m mannitol mg/l d and mg/l kinetin ph adjusted to with koh and left at for h under continuous light . confocal images were obtained using an olympus fluoview inverted confocal laser scanning microscope equipped with an argon ion laser system and a numerical aperture objective lens . in all experiments the microscope stage was _PROTEIN_ at room temperature . the _METHOD_ signals were detected at nm for _METHOD_ and nm for chlorophyll . sections of _PROTEIN_ were scanned and images were captured with the fluoview software as tiff files . eight sections were superimposed and images were imported into adobe photoshop and cropped . radiolabeled precursors were synthesized in a wheat germ lysate system in the presence of met according to suggested protocols . after translation unlabeled met was added to mm and postribosomal supernatants were prepared by centrifugation at at for min . the radiolabeled precursors were incubated with chloroplasts that were isolated from d old pea seedlings as described . the postimport thermolysin treatment and reisolation of intact chloroplasts as well as fractionation into stromal and crude _LOCATION_ fractions were performed as described . sucrose step gradient fractionations were performed as described . after gradient separation the stroma and envelope protein fractions were concentrated by acetone precipitation whereas the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ were concentrated by centrifugation at after dilution with volumes of

brilliant blue r destained to verify fractionation and dried . the radiolabeled proteins were visualized using a _PROTEIN_ phosphorimager . to verify the purity and recovery of sucrose density gradient fractions proteins were blotted onto nitrocellulose _LOCATION_ and probed with _PROTEIN_ antibody as a stromal marker with cytochrome f antibody as a _LOCATION_ marker or with tic antibody as an envelope marker . chlorophyll _METHOD_ was measured using a mini _PROTEIN_ portable chlorophyll fluorometer as described . chlorophyll content was determined by absorbance changes in intact leaves

software package . ten _METHOD_ of total rna was subjected to electrophoresis on a agarose gel containing formaldehyde transferred to a nylon _LOCATION_ and probed with labeled probes . the probes were obtained by pcr amplification using the following oligonucleotides for _PROTEIN_ gagttgcagttttgaacagc and ttctttggaaacgtagcagc for _PROTEIN_ aaacgtcaaacatagcagcag and _PROTEIN_ and for fesod caaactctggagtttcactg and tcaagtctggcacttacgc . radioactive probes were synthesized with an oligolabeling kit from amersham using random primers . hybridization was performed at in a solution containing formamide _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ denhardt 's solution _PROTEIN_ and salmon sperm dna . after hybridization _LOCATION_ were washed with ssc and _PROTEIN_ at and radiolabeled bands were visualized and quantified in a _PROTEIN_ phosphorimager . because _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ transcripts were not detectable on rna gel blots we used rt pcr to compare the mrna abundance of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and antisense _PROTEIN_ primers were used to amplify kb of _PROTEIN_ . sense and antisense primers were used to amplify kb of _PROTEIN_ . the pcrs were performed in a final volume of using serial dilutions of the cdna as templates . the reaction mixtures were heated at for min and cooled to and units of ex taq polymerase was added to initiate the amplification reaction . thirty five cycles of amplification were performed in an eppendorf mastercycler gradient each consisting of min of denaturation at min of annealing at and min of extension at . the amplified products were resolved by electrophoresis on a agarose gel blotted onto a nylon _LOCATION_ and probed with labeled gene specific probes for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . sense and antisense primers were used to amplify bp of the actin gene under the same conditions as an internal control . the relative amounts of apoplastocyanin and holoplastocyanin in _LOCATION_ of the wild type and _PROTEIN_ mutants were analyzed as described . for these experiments _LOCATION_ were isolated from intact chloroplasts from week old plants grown on soil . approximately plants were used for each isolation and two replicates were performed . plastocyanin was purified from fresh spinach obtained from a local health food store essentially as described . the purified protein migrated as a single band by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and was blue with the characteristic absorption spectrum after oxidation with ferricyanide . apoplastocyanin was produced by treatment with ascorbate and kcn as described by citation . total shoot protein samples from plants grown on _METHOD_ agar plates for native gel assays were obtained as described and native gel assays for sod activity were performed as described . three independent replicate assays were performed . the sod isozymes were identified by differential inhibition using mm kcn to inhibit cu/znsod or mm to inhibit cu/znsod and fesod . for sod activity in the stroma fractions intact chloroplasts were isolated from rosette leaves of plants grown on _METHOD_ agar plates as described and stromal protein fractions were obtained as described . two replicate assays were performed . antibodies for immunoblot detection of plastocyanin sod _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ have been described . antibodies were a kind gift from s. bednarek . ribulose bis phosphate _PROTEIN_ large subunit antibody was _PROTEIN_ from agrisera . bound antibodies on blots were detected by the ecf system . quantification of the bands was performed using imagequant software . total protein was determined according to citation . transit sequences and cleavage sites were predicted using the clorop program at http //www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/chlorop/ . protein alignments were done using clustalw . the characteristic domains of cpx _PROTEIN_ indicated by citation were identified in the conserved regions of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . the location of possible transmembrane helices was determined using the program tmhmm at http //www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/tmhmm . hydrophobicity plots were produced according to citation at http //us.expasy.org/tools/protscale.html . sequence data from this article have been deposited with the genbank data library under accession numbers for _PROTEIN_ and for _PROTEIN_ .
