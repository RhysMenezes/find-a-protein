_PROTEIN_ proteins are plant specific histone deacetylases . the arabidopsis genome contains four _PROTEIN_ genes namely _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . we have previously demonstrated that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ can repress transcription directly by targeting to promoters in planta . here we show that the n terminal conserved motif and histidine a potential catalytic residue were important for the gene repression activity of _PROTEIN_ . in situ hybridization indicated that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were _PROTEIN_ in ovules embryos shoot apical _METHOD_ and primary leaves . furthermore all three genes were strongly induced during the process of somatic embryogenesis . _PROTEIN_ mrna was only detected in the _METHOD_ and flowers with young siliques and may have adopted different functions . using green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ fusions we demonstrated that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ accumulated in the _LOCATION_ of arabidopsis cells . overexpression of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in transgenic arabidopsis plants generated pleiotropic developmental abnormalities including abnormal leaves delayed flowering and aborted seed development . the data showed that normal pattern of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was essential for normal plant development and that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ may be needed for embryogenesis and embryo development . reverse transcriptase pcr analysis revealed that a number of genes involved in seed development and maturation were repressed in the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ plants supporting a role of _PROTEIN_ in the regulation of gene _PROTEIN_ during seed development .
we have previously demonstrated that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ repressed transcription as fusion proteins when directed to a promoter containing binding sites . here we used site directed mutagenesis to identify residues in _PROTEIN_ that are required for gene repression activity . sequence alignments of all known and putative _PROTEIN_ proteins revealed that the n terminal region of _PROTEIN_ proteins contains an efwg motif as well as conserved amino acid residues . as shown in figure deletion of the n terminal efwg motif resulted in loss of gene repression activity . among the conserved amino acid residues it was suggested that histidine and aspartic acid have potential catalytic properties . we therefore mutated these residues to alanine by site directed mutagenesis to test if they are required for gene repression activity . as shown in figure the mutant yielded _PROTEIN_ gene repression activity compared with wild type protein . the mutant however showed little change in gene repression activity compared with wild type protein . the experiment was repeated thrice with similar results . our data suggest that the n terminal efwg motif is essential for gene repression activity and that amino acid residue may be important but to a lesser extent . the mrna accumulation patterns were examined for all of the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ genes by reverse transcriptase pcr . as shown in figure _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mrnas were detected in leaves roots _METHOD_ young plantlets and a sample containing flowers and siliques however the levels of accumulation differed among the organs . our rt pcr analysis data are consistent with previously published data of northern analysis . in contrast the _PROTEIN_ mrna was only detected in the _METHOD_ and flowers with young siliques suggesting that certain _PROTEIN_ genes may be differentially _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis . the spatial patterns of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mrna accumulation were examined by in situ hybridization . the gene specific probes corresponding to the less conserved c terminal regions of the _PROTEIN_ proteins were generated by pcr . low levels of _PROTEIN_ were detected in all of the organs examined but the highest levels of accumulation were found in the ovules embryos shoot apical meristem and first leaves . figure shows the spatial _PROTEIN_ pattern for _PROTEIN_ mrna accumulation and the data were identical for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . the selective _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ genes in the embryos of seeds indicated a potential functional role in embryogenesis and embryo development that may be addressed experimentally through somatic embryogenesis . although somatic embryogenesis is difficult to achieve in wild type arabidopsis the ectopic _PROTEIN_ of certain transcription _PROTEIN_ such as _PROTEIN_ from brassica napus can induce the proliferation of somatic embryos on transgenic plant tissues . figure illustrates the differentiation of somatic embryos on the cotyledons of transgenic arabidopsis seedlings _PROTEIN_ a _PROTEIN_ nos gene . compared with wild type plantlets the transgenic plantlets have shortened roots swollen dedifferentiating hypocotyls and abnormal cotyledons with somatic embryos differentiating mostly at the tips . in situ hybridization with an _PROTEIN_ specific probe shows that the _PROTEIN_ mrna is accumulating throughout the transgenic cotyledonary tissues but particularly in the somatic embryos and underlying tissues . in contrast _PROTEIN_ mrna did not accumulate in the cotyledons of wild type plants . the same results were found with an _PROTEIN_ specific probe and with an _PROTEIN_ specific probe . the induction of the _PROTEIN_ family of genes therefore appears to be correlated with the competence of tissues to undergo somatic embryogenesis and the early stages of somatic embryo development . this pattern of _PROTEIN_ is similar to that seen with seed derived embryos . it is unclear from this experiment whether the increased levels of _PROTEIN_ gene _PROTEIN_ was caused by the induction of somatic embryos or overexpression of the _PROTEIN_ transcription _PROTEIN_ . to investigate the cellular distribution of _PROTEIN_ proteins we performed an in vivo targeting experiment using a _METHOD_ . _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ gene fusions were created and introduced into arabidopsis under the promoter to achieve high levels of constitutive _PROTEIN_ . to confirm that the fusion proteins entered the _LOCATION_ and associated with chromatin we monitored the _METHOD_ of _METHOD_ at the cellular level . protoplasts were isolated from seedlings of transgenic arabidopsis and localization of the fusion protein was determined by _METHOD_ microscope . as shown in figure the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion protein was localized in the _LOCATION_ of the arabidopsis cells . the maize _PROTEIN_ was previously localized in the nucleolus . the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion protein did not localize uniformly to the entire _LOCATION_ but rather to a much smaller area with sharp boundaries suggesting possible nucleolus localization . similar results were observed with the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . the _METHOD_ alone however was uniformly distributed throughout the cell . we analyzed the phenotypes of the transgenic arabidopsis plants that _PROTEIN_ the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ gene . the _PROTEIN_ of the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ transcript was determined by using a labeled _PROTEIN_ cdna probe . four independent transgenic lines and with high levels of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were identified . low level of endogenous _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was detected in the leaf tissues by northern analysis which is consistent with the rt pcr data in figure . transgenic arabidopsis plants displayed pleiotropic developmental abnormalities at very high frequencies compared with wild type and _METHOD_ plants . these included abnormal leaf and flower morphologies delayed flowering and aborted seed development . among four transgenic lines analyzed about of the transgenic plants were sterile . in sterile plants the sizes of the filaments were significantly shorter than those in normal plants but the pollen was fertile when crossed to wild type plants . the data showed that ectopic _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ may interfere with several normal developmental processes indicating that the spatial regulation of the _PROTEIN_ gene observed earlier may be essential for normal plant development . developmental abnormalities were observed in the plants from four independent transgenic lines but not in wild type control plants or in plants transformed with the _METHOD_ alone . the developmental abnormalities persisted over five generations of selfing . our data suggest that the abnormal phenotypes of the transgenic plants were co inherited with the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ transgene . the numbers in the parentheses are the total plants analyzed . the frequencies are for the transgenic progenies only the non transgenic segregants are not included . abnormal leaves include branching leaf narrow leaf and curled leaf phenotypes . wild type arabidopsis plants flowered at days whereas the _PROTEIN_ flowering plants flowered at days . sterile plants did not produce seeds . to investigate the transcriptional regulatory roles of _PROTEIN_ in plants the _PROTEIN_ of several genes involved in seed development in _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ plants was determined by rt pcr . as shown in figure the transcript levels of a number of seed development related genes were repressed in two _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ transgenic lines and . these include _PROTEIN_ embryogenesis abundant protein cruciferin lectin oleosin seed maturation protein albumin legumin peroxiredoxin and abscisic acid responsive elements binding _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ of these genes was more significantly repressed in plants compared with plants . plants had a higher _PROTEIN_ level of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ compared with plants suggesting a correlation between _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and gene repression .
