mitochondrial fission is achieved partially by the activity of self assembling dynamin related proteins in diverse _METHOD_ . mitochondrial fission in arabidopsis thaliana is mediated by _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ but the other genes and molecular _METHOD_ involved have yet to be elucidated . to identify these genes we screened and analyzed arabidopsis mutants with longer and fewer mitochondria than those of the wild type . _PROTEIN_ was found to be responsible for the phenotype of elongated mitochondria . this phenotype was also observed in _PROTEIN_ plants . est and genomic sequences similar to _PROTEIN_ were found in seed plants but not in other eukaryotes . _PROTEIN_ green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ was found to surround mitochondria and _PROTEIN_ interacts with both and _PROTEIN_ . in the _PROTEIN_ mutant _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was observed in the _LOCATION_ whereas in wild type arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ localized to the ends and constricted sites of mitochondria . these results collectively suggest that mitochondrial fission in arabidopsis is mediated by the plant specific _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ which is required for the relocalization of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ from the _LOCATION_ to mitochondrial fission sites .
in an earlier study seeds of transgenic arabidopsis with mitochondrial targeted green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ were treated with ethyl methanesulfonate to induce mutagenesis and the leaves of plants were screened by _METHOD_ microscopy for abnormally shaped mitochondria . in this study two of these mitochondrial morphology mutants were selected and mapped . both mutants had severely elongated mitochondria that occasionally occurred as an interconnected network similar to the mitochondria of yeast mutants with defective mitochondrial fission genes . one of these genes responsible for the elongated mitochondrial phenotype was mapped to the long arm of chromosome . because this region contained the _PROTEIN_ gene the genomic sequence of _PROTEIN_ of the mutant was determined . a g to a substitution changed an arg residue at position in the conserved _PROTEIN_ domain to a his residue and we named this mutant _PROTEIN_ . sequencing of other mutants found previously with slightly elongated mitochondria enabled us to find an additional allele _PROTEIN_ which had a g to a substitution that changed ala at position to thr . the second locus responsible for the severe mitochondrial elongation phenotype was mapped to the short arm of chromosome . this region does not have any sequences that are similar to the yeast and animal genes involved in mitochondrial fission and mitochondrial morphology . we named the mutant _PROTEIN_ because of its phenotype elongated mitochondria . by fine mapping and sequencing the _PROTEIN_ mutant was found to have a g to a substitution in _GENE_ changing trp at position to a stop codon in the predicted amino acid sequence . four additional mutants with slightly elongated mitochondria had independent nucleotide substitutions in this same gene . we named these five mutant alleles _PROTEIN_ to _PROTEIN_ according to the severity of the phenotype . a t dna insertion line of this gene was obtained from the _PROTEIN_ . mitotracker staining of leaf epidermal cells of this line showed an interconnected network of mitochondria similar to that of the _PROTEIN_ mutant . we named this mutant _PROTEIN_ . introduction of a fusion gene _PROTEIN_ orf or a genomic fragment that includes _GENE_ from bp upstream to bp downstream _PROTEIN_ into _PROTEIN_ restored the wild type mitochondrial phenotype . together these results show that _GENE_ is identical to _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ plants grow more slowly and are slightly smaller than those of the wild type but bolt earlier . all of the _PROTEIN_ mutants can complete their life cycle and have normal fertility under standard growth conditions . although _PROTEIN_ mutants have an interconnected network of mitochondria each cell still has several small discrete mitochondria suggesting that the cells have residual mitochondrial fission . mitochondria in _PROTEIN_ were stained with mitotracker orange cmtmros which accumulates in mitochondria in a _LOCATION_ potential dependent manner and this indicated that the mutants _PROTEIN_ an inner _LOCATION_ potential . in the _PROTEIN_ mutant both disconnected small mitochondria and interconnected mitochondria moved similar to mitochondria in the wild type and changed their morphology dynamically . mitochondria also transiently appeared in the shape of beads on a string . the constricted sites may be sites of ongoing but hampered mitochondrial fission . the predicted _PROTEIN_ protein has amino acid residues with a _METHOD_ of kd . we identified homologs of _PROTEIN_ in the arabidopsis genome _PROTEIN_ as well as in other higher plants . although homologous genes were not found in other eukaryotes the c terminal two thirds of the _PROTEIN_ sequence matched a domain of unknown function _PROTEIN_ that was present in a number of hypothetical proteobacterial proteins . the evolutionary relationship between _PROTEIN_ and these bacterial _PROTEIN_ like sequences is not clear . sosui and das transmembrane domain searches predicted no apparent transmembrane domain in the _PROTEIN_ sequence . as described above mitochondria in _PROTEIN_ mutants are longer in shape _PROTEIN_ but fewer in number than those in the wild type . the reciprocal relationship between the number and size of mitochondria was demonstrated in wild type and _PROTEIN_ cells _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . the mitochondrial morphologies in weak _PROTEIN_ and strong _PROTEIN_ alleles of _PROTEIN_ were quite similar to those of weak _PROTEIN_ and severe _PROTEIN_ alleles of _PROTEIN_ mutants respectively . these elongated mitochondria have about the same diameter as those of the wild type but vary in length from to > . interconnected networks of mitochondria could be seen in both of the severe alleles _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . at high magnification the mitochondria of _PROTEIN_ mutants sometimes appeared as beads on a string as described above for _PROTEIN_ . the similar mitochondrial phenotypes of the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants imply that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are involved in the same or related steps of mitochondrial fission that seem to occur after the initial constriction of mitochondria . to determine the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ the dna fragment _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was introduced into _PROTEIN_ . we selected _PROTEIN_ because its mitochondrial phenotype is as severe as that of _PROTEIN_ and it does not have mt _METHOD_ . the elongated and interconnected mitochondrial phenotype in _PROTEIN_ was rescued by the introduction of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ suggesting that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ could function like the native _PROTEIN_ . while _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signals colocalized with mitotracker signal in the cells the signals did not completely coincide . the observation that green signal _METHOD_ surrounds the magenta signal suggests that _PROTEIN_ localizes to the outer _LOCATION_ or the surface of the mitochondrial outer _LOCATION_ . some of the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ seemed to be slightly concentrated at the ends and constricted sites of mitochondria . similarly _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ localized to the ends and constricted sites of mitochondria . the ends and constricted sites of mitochondria seem to show the past and ongoing sites of mitochondrial fission . to determine the intramitochondrial localization of _PROTEIN_ mitochondria isolated from _PROTEIN_ plants transformed with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were incubated with proteinase k. while proteinase k degraded the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ it did not affect cytochrome c that localizes between the inner and outer mitochondrial _LOCATION_ . when the mitochondrial _LOCATION_ were broken down with a detergent proteinase k degraded both _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and cytochrome c . these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ localizes to the outer surface of mitochondria . to test the possibility that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ interact with each other yeast two hybrid experiments were performed using full length fragments of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . in the case of _PROTEIN_ an n terminal predicted _LOCATION_ portion of the protein without the transmembrane domain was used . as shown in figures to _PROTEIN_ interacts with _PROTEIN_ and with _PROTEIN_ weakly but repeatedly when checked by three reporter genes _PROTEIN_ from independent promoters . the experiment also showed that _PROTEIN_ strongly interacts with itself which was expected because drps form dimers and higher ordered polymers . the interactions between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were confirmed by bimolecular _METHOD_ complementation . arabidopsis leaves were bombarded with two transient _PROTEIN_ plasmids one _PROTEIN_ the n terminal half of yellow _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ fused to _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and the other _PROTEIN_ the c terminal half of _METHOD_ fused to _PROTEIN_ . if the two parts of _METHOD_ come together they give off a yellow green _METHOD_ on excitation . we used a _METHOD_ filter set which made the _METHOD_ appear green . the leaves were simultaneously bombarded with a plasmid _PROTEIN_ mitochondrial targeted red _METHOD_ protein _PROTEIN_ to identify transformed cells and also to identify mitochondria in the cells . as shown in figures and green puncta were observed on mitochondria . these results together with the results suggest that _PROTEIN_ interacts with _PROTEIN_ and with _PROTEIN_ on mitochondria . we transformed the wild type the _PROTEIN_ mutant and the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double t dna insertion mutant _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . in all cases _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signal was observed on mitochondria indicating that the localization of _PROTEIN_ to the mitochondrial outer surface does not require _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ . in wild type plants transformed with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ the _METHOD_ signal localized to the ends and constricted sites of mitochondria while in _PROTEIN_ transformed with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ it remained in the _LOCATION_ suggesting that _PROTEIN_ is required for the subcellular transfer of _PROTEIN_ from the _LOCATION_ to mitochondrial fission sites . similar results were obtained with a double transgenic _PROTEIN_ line carrying both an estradiol inducible _PROTEIN_ gene _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . in the absence of estradiol these cells had elongated and network shaped mitochondria and _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signals . in the presence of estradiol two types of cells were observed cells with green spots localized to network shaped or elongated mitochondria and cells with green spots on constricted sites and ends of particle shaped or fragmented mitochondria like those of wild type plants transformed with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . we did not see cells with particulate mitochondria without localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ to mitochondria . green spots were observed to localize on the mitochondria before the mitochondria divided . these results suggest that the relocalization of _PROTEIN_ from the _LOCATION_ to mitochondrial fission sites depends on the presence of _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ is also found on _LOCATION_ and plays a role in _LOCATION_ division . to determine whether _PROTEIN_ also functions in _LOCATION_ division we looked for peroxisomal localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and studied _LOCATION_ morphology in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants transformed with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . in plants derived from a cross between a transgenic plant transformed with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and another transgenic plant _PROTEIN_ fused to a peroxisomal targeting signal _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signals were observed on _LOCATION_ but only as a small portion of the total _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signal which was primarily associated with mitochondria . consistent with the weak peroxisomal localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _LOCATION_ of _PROTEIN_ appeared very similar to those of the wild type . by contrast _LOCATION_ were enlarged in leaves and elongated in roots of the _PROTEIN_ mutant . chloroplast morphology was similar to the wild type in both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants . although the localization of _PROTEIN_ on _LOCATION_ should be examined in more detail in the future these results collectively suggest that _PROTEIN_ does not have a clear function in _LOCATION_ morphology .
