dna methylation is an epigenetic mechanism that has important functions in transcriptional silencing and is associated with repressive histone methylation . to further investigate silencing _METHOD_ we screened a mutagenized arabidopsis thaliana population for _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ redundantly controlled by dna methyltransferases _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . here we identify the hypomorphic mutant carrying a mutation _PROTEIN_ in the cytoplasmic bifunctional methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase/methenyltetrahydrofolate cyclohydrolase . _PROTEIN_ levels of oxidized tetrahydrofolates in and lethality of loss of function demonstrate the essential enzymatic role of in arabidopsis . accumulation of homocysteine and s adenosylhomocysteine genome wide dna hypomethylation loss of and transposon derepression indicate that s adenosylmethionine dependent transmethylation is inhibited in . comparative analysis of dna methylation revealed that the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ pathways involving positive feedback with are mostly affected . our work highlights the sensitivity of epigenetic networks to one _PROTEIN_ metabolism due to their common s adenosylmethionine dependent transmethylation and has implications for human associated diseases .
mutant was identified by screening seedlings of an _METHOD_ mutagenized population of arabidopsis that carried an _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ insertion event in wt background for individuals that showed _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . using deep sequencing of bulked _METHOD_ positive progeny of mutant crossed with a wt plant of ecotype landsberg _LOCATION_ we confined the target region containing the causative mutation to the north end of chromosome . to identify the causative mutation mutant was crossed to wt and the co segregation of candidate _METHOD_ mutations in _METHOD_ positive progeny was analysed using dcaps markers . a guanine to adenine transition in a gene encoding a putative methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase/methenyltetrahydrofolate cyclohydrolase showed co segregation in _METHOD_ positive individuals . the mutant phenotype segregated as a recessive monogenic trait _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . the mutation herein after named leads to a predicted substitution of a conserved arginine by glutamine at residue _PROTEIN_ . to confirm that caused the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ a mutant was crossed with a heterozygous plant containing a transfer dna insertion allele . _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in progeny co segregated with the allele confirming that caused the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in . _METHOD_ positive plants originating from mutant had pale leaves reduced seed set were smaller and developed more slowly compared with wt but did not display other morphological defects . in contrast homozygous mutants showed severe developmental defects including dwarfism pale shortened leaves reduced apical dominance delayed flowering prolonged vegetative phase and infertility . moreover on average we only retrieved one viable homozygous mutant out of seeds from a heterozygous parent indicating that more than of homozygous mutants died prematurely . viability seemed to be affected during or after germination because siliques from wt and heterozygous did not show differences in ovule and seed development . we did not retrieve any homozygous mutants from the t dna alleles or . these results led to the conclusion that is an essential gene in arabidopsis and that the t dna insertion in the first intron in does not completely abolish the function of . moreover the results indicate that _PROTEIN_ in partially impairs gene function causing a hypomorphic phenotype that does not affect viability . to test if dna methylation is altered in mutants we analysed the medea intergenic _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ locus using a well established southern blot assay . in wt approximately half of the _PROTEIN_ isr alleles are methylated and restriction digest with methylation sensitive _METHOD_ produces two fragments of similar abundance . both and mutants showed a reduction of the methylated band and the loss of methylation was stronger in than in . we also analysed dna methylation at arabidopsis thaliana short interspersed element by quantitative pcr following methylation sensitive restriction digestion and observed similar reductions in dna methylation . furthermore bisulfite pcr analysis of the levels of methylation at cg chg and chh sites in the tandem repeat region of the transgenic _PROTEIN_ promoter showed a _PROTEIN_ in chg methylation of the transgenic _PROTEIN_ in mutants compared with the wt reference . in summary the dna methylation assays confirmed that is required for dna methylation at different loci in different sequence contexts and the _PROTEIN_ amino acid substitution leads to reduced dna methylation . because of the limiting amounts of tissue available from mutants only mutants were analysed subsequently . to get a general view of the dna methylation defects in we analysed genome wide dna methylation at single nucleotide resolution by bs seq . the average global dna methylation was reduced by relative to wt . the strongest effect was observed in the chg context which lost of dna methylation relative to wt followed by chh and cg methylation with and _PROTEIN_ respectively . dna methylation in all sequence contexts was mostly _PROTEIN_ over the te rich pericentromeric regions which contain most of the dna methylation along the chromosomes . accordingly average methylation levels over tes were strongly _PROTEIN_ in compared with wt especially in chg and chh contexts . dna methylation was also moderately _PROTEIN_ over protein coding genes indicating that is not only required for repressive dna methylation at tes but also for efficient gene body cg methylation although to a lesser degree compared with non cg methylation . the different effects on dna methylation in the different sequence contexts was also apparent when comparing wt and cg chg and chh methylation levels in randomly selected bp windows of the genome with methylation thresholds > . this comparison additionally shows a positive correlation of dna methylation levels between wt and in all three sequence contexts which indicates that dna methylation was _PROTEIN_ uniformly across the genome as opposed to the dna methylation patterns in loss of function dnmt mutants which show either nearly complete loss across the sample pool or at a subset of regions . to define the effect of the mutation on the different dna methylation pathways we calculated differentially methylated regions that had _PROTEIN_ dna methylation in or the dnmt mutants compared with the wt reference . the comparison of hypo dmrs clearly showed that _PROTEIN_ dependent chg methylation was the most affected followed by _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ dependent chh methylation _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and finally _PROTEIN_ dependent cg methylation that was the least affected in . it is noteworthy that dna methylation levels were also _PROTEIN_ in regions that were only defined as dmrs in the dnmt mutants but not in . moreover all subsets of hypo dmrs showed residual dna methylation which supports a uniform genome wide _PROTEIN_ in . heat maps of hierarchically clustered chg and chh hypo dmrs further illustrated that dna methylation levels in are evenly _PROTEIN_ at moderate degrees and thus generally proportional to wt levels . the equal ratio of te versus pcg overlapping cg hypo dmrs in _PROTEIN_ and is also in agreement with a uniform _PROTEIN_ in genomic dna methylation in . accordingly the small subset of _PROTEIN_ cg hypo dmrs shared by does not seem to represent site specific function but is more likely due to stringent criteria for dmr calling which were not met by the majority of sites in despite reduced cg methylation levels . in the chh context rddm and the _PROTEIN_ pathway were both affected by . the chromosomal distribution of chh hypo dmrs with high densities inside and at the peripheries of the pericentromeric regions and lower densities in the chromosomal _METHOD_ reflects the overlaps with the alternative chh methylation pathways . in summary the dna methylation analysis of revealed a rather uniform genome wide _PROTEIN_ which is most pronounced in the chg and chh context . dna methylation by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and rddm is functionally linked to histone methylation because _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ directly bind in a feedback loop with the histone methyltransferases _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and pol iv is recruited to chromatin by binding _PROTEIN_ . to test if is also affected in we analysed dimethylation by _METHOD_ . _LOCATION_ of mutants showed a strong _PROTEIN_ in but the majority of the _LOCATION_ still contained dna dense chromocenters visualized by dapi staining . therefore the strong _PROTEIN_ in chg and chh methylation in contrast to the small _PROTEIN_ in cg methylation is likely explained by the combined effect of impaired dna and methylation . to test if loss of dna methylation in led to transcriptional derepression we analysed the _PROTEIN_ levels of different retrotransposons that were previously identified as upregulated in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ triple mutants . quantitative reverse transcription pcr showed that these tes are also strongly induced in . transcriptome analysis of and wt by rna seq confirmed that average transcript levels over chh and chg hypo dmrs are higher in than in wt . many transcripts from tes that were silenced in wt were highly abundant in whereas transcriptional differences of pcgs were more even and showed a slight tendency towards higher transcript levels in wt . correspondingly pericentromeric regions showed many differentially upregulated tes a lesser in whereas chromosome _METHOD_ contained approximately equal distributions of up and downregulated pcgs . the differentially upregulated tes in belonged to class i as well as class ii transposons . among the differentially upregulated tes members of the ltr/gypsy family were overrepresented and members of the rc/helitron family were under represented compared with the genomic distribution . in summary the transcriptional analyses have shown that the loss of dna methylation in led to derepression of transposons and genes predominantly in the pericentromeric region . the observed transcriptional changes in the chromosome _METHOD_ seem to be _PROTEIN_ a consequence of pleiotropic effects of impaired function . this is supported by an analysis of go _METHOD_ annotated to genes that are significantly downregulated in compared with wt . the statistically most significantly enriched biological processes indicate that serves important functions in sugar metabolism isoprenoid synthesis redox homoeostasis and photosynthesis . since downregulated genes did not show a significant loss of dna methylation the overall effects on transcript abundance caused by _PROTEIN_ gene body methylation in are likely to be negligible . arabidopsis contains two highly conserved protein domains a catalytic domain in the n terminal half and a nad binding domain of the rossmann fold superfamily in the c terminal half . therefore is probably required for the interconversion of tetrahydrofolate species in one _PROTEIN_ metabolism of arabidopsis . members of the bifunctional enzyme family catalyse the reversible interconversion of methylenetetrahydrofolate to methenyltetrahydrofolate and further to formyltetrahydrofolate _PROTEIN_ . these enzymatic activities have previously been detected in plant extracts . the arabidopsis genome encodes four homologues the mitochondrial _PROTEIN_ and which are putatively _LOCATION_ and which lacks an n terminal targeting peptide and is presumably localized in the cytoplasm . we confirmed the subcellular localization of the latter two homologues by _PROTEIN_ and in vivo imaging of the full length fusion proteins ypet ypet and ypet in nicotiana benthamiana showing that is predominantly in the cytoplasm . the met cycle is exclusively localized in the cytoplasm and is required for the synthesis of sam which serves as methyl donor for many transmethylation reactions including those catalysed by histone and dnmts . during transmethylation sam is converted to sah which is further processed into adenosine and hcy by the sah hydrolase . hcy is recycled to met by thf dependent transmethylation activity of methionine synthase and can serve for a new round of sam synthesis . to test if the dna methylation defects in are caused by changes in the met cycle we analysed the levels of sam sah and hcy as well as cysteine in wt and col leaves . sam and sah were both significantly increased in but the stronger increase in sah levels led to an overall _PROTEIN_ of the methylation index . mi is an important measure of the organismal methylation status because sah is a strong competitive inhibitor of sam dependent transmethylation . because of the low intracellular concentration and high affinity for methyltransferases it has been suggested that even small changes in the mi can lead to a reduction in transmethylation activity . therefore it is likely that the _PROTEIN_ mi in leads to _PROTEIN_ activities of dna and histone methyltransferases as reflected by the observed dna and histone methylation defects . this is further supported by a fold increase in hcy in because hcy accumulation leads to inhibition of sah hydrolysis and consequently to a lower mi . analysis of folate metabolites in leaves of and wt showed that total folate content did not differ significantly but had an fold increase in thf thf . on the other hand the levels of ch thf which also include the _PROTEIN_ thf pool were reduced by and _PROTEIN_ thf levels were also lower . unexpectedly there was no significant difference in thf contents which is the product of thf reductase that serves as co substrate for the methylation of hcy to met and constitutes the most abundant active thf species . the low levels of the oxidized folates _PROTEIN_ thf ch thf and _PROTEIN_ thf suggest an impairment in the dehydrogenase and cyclohydrolase activities towards the formation of _PROTEIN_ thf . on the basis of the crystal structure and site directed mutagenesis of human the conserved arginine that is mutated in _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ a hydrogen bond with nadp and is required for dehydrogenase but not cyclohydrolase activity . therefore we anticipate that the _PROTEIN_ mutation has a similar effect in mutants . accordingly the accumulation of the reduced _METHOD_ thf thf in might reflect reduced conversion of thf to ch thf which is in agreement with the homology based prediction that the _PROTEIN_ mutation affects nadp binding and dehydrogenase activity . the _PROTEIN_ pool of oxidized _PROTEIN_ further suggests that one _PROTEIN_ supply from formate via _PROTEIN_ and reverse cyclohydrolase by is not sufficient to compensate for reduced dehydrogenase activity . this is in accordance with metabolic analyses showing relatively low one _PROTEIN_ flow from formate to serine . ser can serve as a one _PROTEIN_ source through the reversible enzymatic activity of serine hydroxymethyltransferase which converts ser and thf to thf and glycine . in addition the gly decarboxylase complex converts gly and thf to thf _PROTEIN_ dioxide and ammonia during photorespiration which in turn can lead to ser synthesis by shmt in the mitochondria . we analysed amino acid levels in rosette leaves and found a threefold increase of gly levels in compared with wt and col controls whereas ser levels were only slightly increased in . in accordance with our folate analysis the lower ser/gly ratio in might be due to increased shmt activity towards thf formation . furthermore mutants showed a fold and fold increase in proline and met levels respectively . the increase in met might be due to increased de novo synthesis _LOCATION_ in response to impaired met recycling whereas proline accumulation is typically observed as a stress response . we sought to manipulate one _PROTEIN_ metabolism in by exogenous application of metabolites involved in the folate and met cycle and monitor root growth and dna methylation effects . previously it has been shown that growth phenotypes dna methylation and epigenetic silencing defects caused by _PROTEIN_ activated thf pools because of impaired _LOCATION_ folylpolyglutamate synthetase _METHOD_ or chemical inhibition of folate synthesis by sulfamethazine _PROTEIN_ were complemented by exogenous application of _PROTEIN_ thf or met . application of _PROTEIN_ thf as well as thf tests for defects in caused by reduced folate availability before the flow of one _PROTEIN_ into the met cycle whereas application of met tests for defects in the met cycle and _PROTEIN_ was used as a control . in contrast to previously described complementation of _METHOD_ mutants _PROTEIN_ thf strongly inhibited root growth of seedlings without showing an inhibitory effect on wt seedlings . although analysis of global dna methylation levels revealed that these are largely independent of the observed root growth responses average chg methylation over the previously defined chg hypo dmrs significantly increased upon met application . on the other hand _PROTEIN_ thf as well as thf did not rescue the dna methylation defects in . these results indicate that in contrast to the _METHOD_ mutants and _PROTEIN_ inhibition the dna methylation defects in are probably not the mere result of diminished folate pools but rather point towards an inhibition of methionine synthase .
