plants have evolved a number of _PROTEIN_ responses to cope with growth in conditions of limited phosphate supply involving biochemical metabolic and developmental changes . we prepared an _METHOD_ mutagenized population of an arabidopsis thaliana transgenic line harboring a reporter gene specifically responsive to pi starvation _PROTEIN_ and screened for mutants altered in pi starvation regulation . one of the mutants _PROTEIN_ displayed reduced response of _PROTEIN_ to pi starvation and also had a broad range of pi starvation responses impaired including the responsiveness of various other pi starvation induced genes and metabolic responses such as the increase in anthocyanin accumulation . _PROTEIN_ was positionally cloned and shown be related to the phosphorus _PROTEIN_ response gene from chlamydomonas reinhardtii . a _METHOD_ protein fusion was localized in the _LOCATION_ independently of pi status as is the case for . _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ in pi sufficient conditions and in contrast to is only weakly responsive to pi starvation . _PROTEIN_ and other members of the protein family share a myb domain and a predicted coiled coil domain defining a subtype within the myb superfamily the myb cc family . therefore _PROTEIN_ was found to bind as a dimer to an imperfect palindromic sequence . _PROTEIN_ binding sequences are present in the promoter of pi starvation responsive structural genes indicating that this protein acts downstream in the pi starvation signaling pathway .
the _PROTEIN_ gene like other members of family is specifically responsive to pi starvation . a translational fusion between _PROTEIN_ and the coding region of the gus gene also displays a specific response to pi starvation in transgenic a. thaliana plants transgenic plants harboring this reporter gene are therefore suitable for identifying mutants with altered pi starvation responses . seedlings of an _METHOD_ mutagenized population were screened by use of a nondestructive gus staining assay . putative mutants were identified as follows nine day old seedlings grown in medium lacking pi were stained with gus for h during which time plates were examined every hour . seedlings showing reduced gus staining were selected as candidates for further analysis mutant candidates were selected and progeny was obtained from of them . after preliminary phenotypic analysis _PROTEIN_ which was affected in the _PROTEIN_ of several pi starvation inducible genes and which did not accumulate anthocyanin during pi starvation stress was selected for further analysis . the _PROTEIN_ that _PROTEIN_ did not accumulate anthocyanin in response to pi starvation suggested a simple screen for _PROTEIN_ . after pre screening seedlings grown under pi starvation conditions for colorless cotyledons followed by the analysis of gus activity we identified a single additional mutant _PROTEIN_ with reduced gus staining . results of crossing experiments indicated that both mutants were recessive and allelic . prior to the phenotypic analysis the _PROTEIN_ allele was backcrossed four times with the wild type transgenic reporter line . in addition to the study of the _PROTEIN_ of reporter gene several metabolic and developmental traits influenced by pi starvation as well as the _PROTEIN_ of six pi starvation responsive genes were examined in and _PROTEIN_ mutant alleles . the _PROTEIN_ mutations resulted in reduced gus activity driven by _PROTEIN_ in all parts of pi starved plants . in addition pi starvation induced increases in anthocyanin accumulation and to a lesser although in a statistically significant extent in the root to shoot growth ratio were impaired in the plants homozygous for either of the _PROTEIN_ alleles . the effect _METHOD_ mutations on these two traits was specific for pi starvation stress as no significant difference was observed between mutant alleles and wild type in anthocyanin accumulation or on the root/shoot growth ratio under nitrogen starvation conditions . moreover the mutants showed increased anthocyanin synthesis in response to the stress related hormones abscisic acid and jasmonic acid similar to wild type plants . both mutations resulted in a statistically significant _PROTEIN_ in the pi content of the plant when plants were grown under pi sufficient conditions and in a _PROTEIN_ in plant growth under pi starvation conditions . in contrast no effect of the mutations of _PROTEIN_ was observed for the pi starvation induced increases in root hair length and number . the effect of the _PROTEIN_ mutations on the _PROTEIN_ of pi starvation induced genes was examined by use of northern analysis . six pi starvation induced genes were analyzed including _PROTEIN_ members of the family _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ encoding a high affinity pi transporter an acid phosphatase and a rnase respectively encoding a protein of unknown function . the pi starvation inducibility of all six genes examined was reduced in the plants homozygous for either _PROTEIN_ allele the effect being most pronounced on _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ gene was cloned by a map based chromosome walking procedure on the basis of a cross between the _PROTEIN_ mutant and the landsberg wild type ecotype . by use of seedlings showing the _PROTEIN_ phenotype gene was mapped to chromosome _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ by a series of simple sequence length polymorphism markers and cleaved amplified polymorphic sequences available in databases . the mapping was further refined by use of new sslp markers generated from sequence information from the a. thaliana genome sequencing project . as a result the _PROTEIN_ locus was defined to a region of kb between bacs and . within this region candidate genes were considered that showed homology to yeast pi starvation signaling genes _PROTEIN_ or to the recently defined gene from the unicellular algae c. reinhardtii . only a single gene _PROTEIN_ in this region showed homology to any of these genes . transformation of the _PROTEIN_ with a kb genomic region spanning the coding region plus sequences kb upstream of the translation initiation codon and kb sequences downstream of the termination codon cloned in the binary vector pbib rescued the wild type phenotype in of transformants . to define experimentally the structure of the _PROTEIN_ gene overlapping cdna fragments were isolated following the marathon _PROTEIN_ protocol by use of oligonucleotides derived from the gene sequence _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . the cdna sequence showed that the predicted intron/exon structure in gene _PROTEIN_ is correct except for the sixth exon which uses an _PROTEIN_ acceptor site nucleotides downstream of that predicted . in addition the first nucleotides of the cdna sequence shown in correspond to a untranslated exon . sequencing of the transcribed region of the two alleles revealed that each contained a point mutation . in the case of the _PROTEIN_ allele the mutation was a c to t transition at nucleotide of the genomic sequence which results in the replacement of gln with an ochre stop codon . mutation is a g to a transition at nucleotide which results in the loss of a splice donor site in the third intron and probably generates a truncated protein . the presence of a single repeat myb domain classifies _PROTEIN_ as well as as members of the myb superfamily of dna binding proteins . a singular characteristic of the _PROTEIN_ and proteins is that they share a second motif predicted to adopt a coiled coil conformation _PROTEIN_ which is a potential dimerization motif . searches in the _PROTEIN_ or embl databanks allowed us to identify proteins containing both domains . a phylogram of all of these proteins was constructed using the neighbor joining method of the clustal program . two subgroups can be distinguished with _PROTEIN_ and the c. reinhardtii protein belonging to the same subgroup . to test the sequence specific dna binding properties of _PROTEIN_ we performed electrophoretic mobility shift assays _METHOD_ with in vitro translated _PROTEIN_ protein and dna fragments from the region _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ a gene whose pi starvation induction is severely impaired in _PROTEIN_ . five overlapping fragments encompassing bp upstream of the first _PROTEIN_ were amplified and radiolabeled by pcr and incubated with the in vitro translated _PROTEIN_ protein . a slower migrating band was observed when either of two overlapping fragments were incubated with _PROTEIN_ . to confirm that the shifted band contained _PROTEIN_ and to examine which part of the _PROTEIN_ protein was responsible for the binding activity observed several _PROTEIN_ or amino terminally truncated derivatives were generated and subjected to binding and _METHOD_ . as a probe the bp fragment representing the overlap between fragments a and b was used . in all cases in which the retarded band was observed the mobility shift correlated with the size of the truncated protein confirming the presence of _PROTEIN_ in the protein dna complex . at least amino terminal amino acids close to the start of the myb domain could be deleted without compromising dna binding . in contrast deletion of amino acids in the _PROTEIN_ terminal region abolished dna binding of the truncated protein . this deletion does not affect the myb domain but the second domain conserved between _PROTEIN_ and from c. reinhardtii in agreement with the idea that the coiled coil domain of these proteins is also necessary for correct dna binding . to further delimit the _PROTEIN_ binding site dna binding assays and _METHOD_ were performed by use of three overlapping deletion derivatives of the bp fragment as a result only one was bound by _PROTEIN_ . scanning mutagenesis consisting of consecutive bp substitutions throughout this bp fragment was performed and the substitution derivatives were subjected to binding and _METHOD_ with _PROTEIN_ . as a result a bp sequence was found to be sufficient for _PROTEIN_ binding . this sequence included an imperfectly palindromic sequence gcatattc . analysis of the effect of mutations on the bp sequence further highlighted the relevance of the imperfect palindromic sequence for binding by _PROTEIN_ . mutations in the sequence of the imperfect palindrome did not greatly affect binding by _PROTEIN_ . the same was true for mutations in positions and the positions that do not conform to the rules of a canonical palindromic sequence . given that mutations at _PROTEIN_ affected the activity of all pi starvation induced genes tested we asked whether they contained the _PROTEIN_ binding sequence _PROTEIN_ in their promoter region . all pi starvation induced genes examined contained a related sequence . the present in gene is bound by _PROTEIN_ . sequences related to the _PROTEIN_ binding site found at the upstream region of phosphate starvation responsive genes from several plant species the imperfect palindromic nature of the _PROTEIN_ binding sequence raised the possibility that _PROTEIN_ would bind its target as a dimer . to address this question the strategy of citation was followed . the full length and the derivative were translated in vitro alone or in combination and the resulting products were tested in dna binding and _METHOD_ with . in addition to the band corresponding to the full length or the deletion derivative a band of intermediate mobility appeared when the cotranslation products were used . this intermediate mobility band corresponds to the mobility expected for a heterodimer indicating that _PROTEIN_ recognizes its target as a dimer . to evaluate whether control of _PROTEIN_ activity occurs pretranslationally we examined transcript levels in plants grown under different conditions . as shown in figure _PROTEIN_ rna is detected independently of the pi status of the plant but in contrast to in c. reinhardtiicounterpart is only moderately responsive to pi starvation _PROTEIN_ . a common mechanism to regulate nutrient starvation responses is to control the subcellular localization of a transcription _PROTEIN_ . to test whether this could be the case for _PROTEIN_ we prepared a _METHOD_ chimeric gene in which the promoter drives the _PROTEIN_ of the coding region of the green _METHOD_ protein fused to the full size _PROTEIN_ orf . the vectors containing _METHOD_ fusion gene or the _METHOD_ gene alone were used to transform wild type and _PROTEIN_ mutant plants . analysis of the _PROTEIN_ plants transformed with the fusion protein showed that it could phenotypically complement the pi starvation response defect indicating that the _METHOD_ fusion protein is functional . microscopic analysis showed that whereas in the plants harboring the control _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was distributed throughout the cell in the plants harboring the _METHOD_ construct _METHOD_ was found in the _LOCATION_ both in the wild type and in the grown under any pi regimen . this is shown in for the case of wild type transformed plants and indicates that the subcellular localization to the _LOCATION_ is independent of the pi status . a similar pi status independent _LOCATION_ localization was found for the c. reinhardtii protein .
