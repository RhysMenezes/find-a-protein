similar to the situation in mammalian cells and yeast messenger ribonucleo protein homeostasis in plant cells depends on rapid transitions between three functional states i.e . translated mrnps in polysomes stored mrnps and mrnps under degradation . studies in mammalian cells showed that whenever the dynamic exchange of the components between these states is disrupted stalled mrnps accumulate in cytoplasmic aggregates such as stress granules or processing bodies _PROTEIN_ . we identified _PROTEIN_ and sgs in plant cells by detection of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ as marker proteins for the mrna degradation pathway and _PROTEIN_ as well as the rna binding proteins _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ as marker proteins for stored mrnps in sgs . cycloheximide inhibited translation stress treatments and mutants defective in mrnp homeostasis were used to study the dynamic transitions of mrnps between sgs and _PROTEIN_ . sgs and _PROTEIN_ can be clearly discriminated from the previously described heat stress granules _PROTEIN_ which evidently do not contain mrnps . thus the role of _PROTEIN_ as putative mrnp storage sites must be revised .
to confirm the recent identification of _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis thaliana we used _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ as a marker protein . after _PROTEIN_ in tobacco mesophyll protoplasts the intracellular distribution of _PROTEIN_ showed the characteristic dynamic changes . initially _PROTEIN_ was found to be distributed in the cytoplasm with few cytoplasmic foci but rapidly accumulated after a short time period of incubation of the living protoplasts under a coverslip . the number of foci varied from cell to cell . similar results were obtained for _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ but not for _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . one possible explanation is that _METHOD_ influenced the function of _PROTEIN_ or that in contrast with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ localizes only transiently to _PROTEIN_ . the rapid aggregation of _PROTEIN_ under these conditions was most likely induced by the hypoxic conditions under the coverslip . using _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ we observed co localization for both proteins . to test if the two proteins are found in the same protein complexes we used the bimolecular _METHOD_ complementation analysis system also including _PROTEIN_ as an integral part of an active decapping complex . the n and c _METHOD_ tagged proteins were co _PROTEIN_ in tobacco mesophyll protoplasts and analyzed by live cell _METHOD_ microscopy . interactions of _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ could be clearly detected in cytoplasmic foci . the corresponding vector controls were negative . neither fusion protein alone nor fusion proteins in combination with n or c _METHOD_ showed any _METHOD_ . the observation that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ interact in cytoplasmic foci provides evidence that these _PROTEIN_ are in the same complexes . most likely they are bound to mrna but a direct proof of the presence of mrna is lacking . our results are basically consistent with results published previously demonstrating the existence of _PROTEIN_ in plants . minor differences in the details can be ascribed to different experimental _METHOD_ and procedures . to further characterize the endogenous _PROTEIN_ in a. thaliana we raised a polyclonal antiserum against glutathione s transferase _PROTEIN_ purified _PROTEIN_ from a. thaliana . using this antiserum with protein extracts from major organs and cell cultures of a. thaliana a major double band with an apparent molecular weight of about kda and a third band with a weight of kda were detected . a similar but slightly larger double band was also detectable if _PROTEIN_ strep was _PROTEIN_ in tobacco protoplasts . in contrast controls with extracts for protoplasts transformed with empty vector as well as using a pre immune serum revealed no signal . the apparent size is different to the expected size of kda . the two bands might represent different modified _METHOD_ of _PROTEIN_ . for example it was shown that yeast and mammalian _PROTEIN_ also migrate as two separable _METHOD_ on _PROTEIN_ gels and _PROTEIN_ is evidently modified by phosphorylation . on the other hand the kda band might represent a degradation product of _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ levels in leaves roots green siliques and seeds were much lower than in a. thaliana cell cultures and flower buds or were even below the detection level . we further confirmed the specificity of the _PROTEIN_ antiserum in an _METHOD_ analysis with tobacco protoplasts _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . next we used the _PROTEIN_ antiserum to investigate conditions of _PROTEIN_ formation in native tissues of a. thaliana . as shown earlier _PROTEIN_ are very dynamic and change their size rapidly in response to any type of disruption of mrnp homeostasis . such a situation is found in the _PROTEIN_ a. thaliana t dna insertion mutant . detection of _PROTEIN_ in mesophyll protoplasts of the _PROTEIN_ line revealed strongly increased foci as compared with the mesophyll protoplasts from wild type plants . this result is consistent with the role of _PROTEIN_ in the degradation of mrna in plants . the observations suggest that the increased structures of _PROTEIN_ result from an accumulation of mrnps that can not be degraded . to corroborate these conclusions we treated a. thaliana wt and _PROTEIN_ protoplasts with cycloheximide to block mrna release from polysomal complexes . the state of _PROTEIN_ containing foci was determined min after cycloheximide treatment . whereas no changes were visible in the wt or mock treated cells we observed a marked reduction in the size and number of foci in the _PROTEIN_ line . these results are consistent with observations in yeast and mammalian cells showing that the size of _PROTEIN_ depends on the relation of the influx of non translated mrna and their subsequent degradation . besides cycloheximide treatment stress conditions are well known to influence the balance between mrna translation storage and degradation . to investigate the influence of stress on the distribution of _PROTEIN_ we examined the root tips of day old wt and _PROTEIN_ seedlings grown under control hypoxic or heat stress conditions respectively . we rarely observed _PROTEIN_ in wt seedlings under control conditions whereas many tiny foci were found in root cells of _PROTEIN_ seedlings . in contrast to this the size and number of _PROTEIN_ increased in both types of seedlings under hypoxic stress . under heat stress conditions a strong increase of _PROTEIN_ size was observed in wt seedlings but not in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . to explain this unexpected result it is tempting to speculate that _PROTEIN_ not only plays a role as a exonuclease but also as a structural component of _PROTEIN_ formed under heat stress conditions . alternatively mrna degradation through the degradation pathway might be enhanced in these mutants . in summary our results show that _PROTEIN_ are dynamic structures involved in mrna degradation and that they are connected with the pool of translated mrna . heat stress granules _PROTEIN_ were identified as aggregates of electron dense cytoplasmic particles containing _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ families as the dominant components . _PROTEIN_ are formed during long term heat stress and are found in all tissues and plant species investigated so far . analysis of the composition of _PROTEIN_ revealed that translationally silenced housekeeping mrnps are stored in the _PROTEIN_ . in contrast to this sgs as described for mammalian cells are not dependent on the presence of _PROTEIN_ . the formation of sgs under stress conditions requires the rna binding protein tia harbouring a prion domain and includes translation initiation _PROTEIN_ as well as polya mrna . to investigate a possible relationship between _PROTEIN_ and sgs in plants we performed a co localization analysis of polya mrna and _PROTEIN_ as a marker for _PROTEIN_ in heat stressed tomato cell cultures . the analysis revealed two types of distinct cytoplasmic complexes polya mrna granules which became apparent after min and the _PROTEIN_ which could be detected after h of heat stress . this observation suggested that sgs also exist in plants beside the _PROTEIN_ . to support these conclusions we tested the localization of other proteins typically associated with sgs . to test if the sgs harbour translation initiation _PROTEIN_ we studied the co localization of polya mrna and translation initiation _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in heat stressed tomato cell cultures . the translation initiation _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was used as a control because in mammalian cells it is not recruited to sgs . the translation initiation _PROTEIN_ were detected by using a specific antiserum . under control conditions the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ as well as the polya mrna were found to be dispersed in the cytoplasm . after mins of heat stress both _PROTEIN_ and the polya mrna aggregated together in cytoplasmic granules whereas the _PROTEIN_ remained dispersed in the cytoplasm . in nicotiana plumbaginifolia and a. thaliana two _LOCATION_ proteins _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were identified as components of pre mrna splicing and they are evidently related to mammalian tia . these proteins also have a glutamine rich prion related domain in addition to three rna recognition motifs that share sequence homology with the human tia protein . the analysis of a _METHOD_ tagged version of _PROTEIN_ revealed a localization in the _LOCATION_ under control conditions but relocalization to cytoplasmic granules under heat stress . using a monoclonal antibody we detected that _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ co localized with polya mrna . to test if the _PROTEIN_ homologue _PROTEIN_ behaves in an identical manner we analysed the localization of _METHOD_ tagged versions of _PROTEIN_ and translation initiation _PROTEIN_ in tobacco mesophyll protoplasts . the results were identical for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . moreover we could show that _PROTEIN_ co localizes with _PROTEIN_ . in summary these results show that polya mrna translation initiation _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are recruited together to cytoplasmic structures under stress conditions . the results are similar to observations made with mammalian cells and provide evidence for the existence of sgs in plants . heat stress is known to cause a polysomal run off of house keeping mrnas . it is reasonable to assume that the rapid accumulation of mrnp in sgs is connected with this phenomenon . to further characterize the sgs and their components we used tobacco mesophyll protoplasts transiently overexpressing _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ tagged proteins . we used cycloheximide combined with heat stress treatment of tobacco mesophyll protoplasts to identify a possible connection with the pool of translated mrna . as the analysis of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ revealed a co localization in the sgs we used both as marker proteins for the sgs . as expected mock treated cells showed the relocalization of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in cytoplasmic sgs after heat stress . in contrast in cycloheximide treated cells the sg formation was blocked . we obtained similar results when _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was used as an sg marker protein . we conclude from these observations that the sgs are in a dynamic exchange with polysomes and that their assembly depends on the release of untranslated mrnps from polysomes . it can not be ruled out that newly synthesized proteins are required for the formation of sgs but as these sgs are formed rapidly this _METHOD_ to be very unlikely . to test if the _PROTEIN_ proteins function in the same manner as mammalian tia in the sequestration of mrna in sgs we created truncation mutants lacking either the rrm domain _PROTEIN_ or the prd domain _PROTEIN_ . for _PROTEIN_ we made a mutant with amino acid exchanges in the three _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ known to be deficient in the rna binding capacity . the mutant proteins fused to _METHOD_ were transiently _PROTEIN_ in tobacco mesophyll protoplast and the localization was analyzed under control conditions and after min of heat stress . for all types of mutants we observed a reduced localization to the _LOCATION_ under control conditions . interestingly in heat stressed protoplasts the localization of proteins harbouring mutations of the rrm remained unaffected by the heat stress . only for _PROTEIN_ was a slight accumulation in sgs observed . these results show that similar to the situation in mammalian cells the rna binding capacity and the n terminal prion like domain is required for the localization of the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in sgs . in mammalian cells the tia plays a central role in the formation of the sgs . thus this raises the question of whether this is also true for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . to test this possibility we co _PROTEIN_ various mutant proteins with or _PROTEIN_ as markers for the sgs . in protoplasts co _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ and the the formation of sgs was stronger compared with cells _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ alone . in contrast in protoplasts _PROTEIN_ the rna binding mutants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ no formation of sgs was detected . interestingly even the co _PROTEIN_ of the respective wild type proteins could not rescue the formation of sgs indicating that the mutation of the rrm has dominant negative effects . although the results clearly show the differences between the three types of granules it is possible that they are related to each other . to address this question we analyzed the co localization of the appropriate marker proteins in tobacco mesophyll protoplasts under control and stress conditions . the presentation is focused on the comparison of three pairs of aggregates i.e . _PROTEIN_ versus _PROTEIN_ sgs versus _PROTEIN_ and sgs versus _PROTEIN_ . for the co localization studies with marker proteins of _PROTEIN_ and sgs a short term stress of min was used . however for co localization studies including _PROTEIN_ protoplasts were heat stressed for min followed by a recovery period of h at and then by a subsequent h heat stress . this procedure guarantees the accumulation of _PROTEIN_ which are required for the efficient assembly of _PROTEIN_ . the lack of co localization of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ marker proteins revealed that these aggregates are clearly separate and that there is no direct relationship between them . in contrast to this our analysis in the sg/pb and sg/hsg pairs frequently revealed the complexes to be in close proximity . although this does not indicate a functional interaction the close proximity of sgs and _PROTEIN_ is in agreement with results reported for mammalian cells . it is tempting to speculate that mrnps can be directly transferred from sgs to the degradation machinery in _PROTEIN_ .
