sulfurtransferases comprise a group of enzymes widely distributed in archaea eubacteria and eukaryota which catalyze the transfer of a sulfur atom from suitable sulfur donors to nucleophilic sulfur acceptors . in all _METHOD_ analyzed to date small gene families encoding str proteins have been identified . the gene products were localized to different compartments of the cells . our interest concerns the localization of str proteins encoded in the _LOCATION_ genome of arabidopsis . computer based prediction methods revealed localization in different compartments of the cell for six putative atstrs . several methods were used to determine the localization of the atstr proteins experimentally . for a mitochondrial localization was demonstrated by immunodetection in the proteome of isolated mitochondria resolved by one and two dimensional gel electrophoresis and subsequent blotting . the respective mature protein was identified by _METHOD_ _METHOD_ sequencing . the same result was obtained by transient _PROTEIN_ of fusion constructs with the green _METHOD_ protein in arabidopsis protoplasts whereas was exclusively localized to the cytoplasm by this method . three members of the single domain atstr were localized in the chloroplasts as demonstrated by transient _PROTEIN_ of green _METHOD_ protein fusions in protoplasts and stomata whereas the single domain was shown to be cytoplasmic . the remarkable subcellular distribution of was additionally analyzed by transmission electron immunomicroscopy using a monospecific antibody against green _METHOD_ protein indicating an attachment to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . the knowledge of the intracellular localization of the members of this multiprotein family will help elucidate their specific functions in the organism .
arabidopsis protoplasts were transformed using a transient _PROTEIN_ system with and including or excluding their putative targeting peptide sequences . colocalization of the _METHOD_ n _METHOD_ with mitotracker orange _METHOD_ a dye that is specifically enriched in mitochondria in the same protoplasts using a confocal laser scanning microscope _PROTEIN_ resulted in the same picture . a second control for mitochondrial intracellular localization was used the targeting peptide of the mitochondrial protein ser hydroxymethyltransferase was fused to the _METHOD_ protein resulting in the same image as transient transformation with the fusion construct . these results indicated import of the protein into the mitochondria . the same localization results were obtained with a _METHOD_ microscope . the corresponding bright field picture visualizes the protoplast 's cell _LOCATION_ demonstrates the intactness of the protoplasts and demonstrates the position of the chloroplasts . _PROTEIN_ without its putative targeting peptide sequence remained in the cytoplasm . the fusion construct of with the targeting peptide sequence and the _METHOD_ encoding cdna sequence at the end _METHOD_ resulted in a _METHOD_ image identical to the transformed _METHOD_ c vector alone . this indicates that the n terminal targeting peptide is recognized by the import machinery of the mitochondria . overview of the _METHOD_ fusion clones produced protein was described to be cytoplasmic . however the end of the sequence was possibly not correctly determined since the est clone _PROTEIN_ obtained from the arabidopsis biological resource center ohio state university contained a putative targeting peptide of amino acids . therefore protoplasts were transformed with the respective constructs including or excluding the extension _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . all fusion proteins remained in the cytoplasm . obviously the additional dna at the end did not encode a putative targeting peptide _METHOD_ . localization of sulfurtransferases to demonstrate the reliability of localization studies using _METHOD_ fusion proteins methods based on antibody specificity were applied . mitochondria were purified from arabidopsis cell cultures chloroplasts were enriched from green arabidopsis plants and total protein extracts were prepared from green arabidopsis plants . in the western blot analysis a protein of about kd was detected in the mitochondrial fraction corresponding to the predicted size of the mature protein . in total extracts a protein of about kd was found close to the predicted size of the protein including the targeting peptide . the proteome of mitochondria purified from arabidopsis cell cultures was separated by two dimensional gel electrophoresis and was subject to western blot analysis . in comparison to the western blot of the one dimensional gel the development of the color reaction was prolonged to detect as many cross reacting proteins as possible without obtaining too much background . two protein spots a major and a minor were identified in the immunoreaction . the molecular _METHOD_ and the pi of the major spot are in agreement with the predicted values of the mature protein . in parallel the mitochondrial proteome was separated under the same conditions and the gel was _METHOD_ stained . the protein spots corresponding to the proteins recognized by the specific antibody are marked by arrows . in the maldi/tof _METHOD_ and esi _METHOD_ analysis both the major and the minor protein spots were identified as proteins . the difference in the molecular _METHOD_ may be explained by a posttranslational modification such as a phosphorylation . the nature of the modification is still unknown . the sequence of the n terminal peptide of the mature could be determined and the computer predicted cleavage site was confirmed experimentally . the total length of targeting peptide was calculated to amino acids the bar marks the cleavage site . group vi of the atstr family contains five members which have single domains . to clarify their function as many features as possible of each single atstr should be determined . intracellular localization of four of the single domain atstrs was analyzed . to date no est clone of has been isolated . rt pcr using different mrna pools and screening of cdna libraries with sequence specific primers was not successful indicating that the gene encoding may be a pseudogene . nicotiana tabacum leaf cells were transformed with the transient _PROTEIN_ system with the fusion constructs _METHOD_ n and _METHOD_ c or _METHOD_ n and _METHOD_ c using the ballistic method of particle gun bombardment . transformed tobacco leaf epidermal and guard cells were analyzed by _METHOD_ microscopy after overnight incubation . was transported into _LOCATION_ as seen in the images of the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ in _LOCATION_ of epidermal and guard cells . the bright field image of an epidermal n. tabacum cell shows the cell dimensions . in pretests leaves of arabidopsis were also transformed by particle bombardment and led to the same localization of the arabidopsis proteins as the heterologous transformation of n. tabacum leaves . controls using a _METHOD_ fusion construct containing the transit peptide of rubisco revealed comparable images as shown in figure b and c . figure d and e show the same guard cell transformed with the _METHOD_ n construct _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was detected in the cytoplasm . to examine targeting of four out of five of the single domain atstr fusion constructs of and with _METHOD_ n or _METHOD_ c were introduced into arabidopsis protoplasts incubated overnight at room temperature and visualized by _METHOD_ microscopy . bright field images were taken to visualize the protoplast 's cell _LOCATION_ and chloroplasts . and were localized in chloroplasts whereas remained in the cytoplasm . the choice of the transformation method either particle bombardment or polyethylene glycol mediated protoplast transformation did not affect the localization results as shown by figures and . in contrast to and which were evenly distributed in the chloroplasts which is indicative for soluble proteins the intracellular localization of the protein was unusual . it was not possible to unambiguously determine whether the protein was outside of the chloroplast on the chloroplast envelope or attached to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ inside the chloroplast . therefore we investigated its localization in more detail . protoplasts were transiently transformed with _METHOD_ n and analyzed with the _PROTEIN_ . in figure the merged image of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and chlorophyll _METHOD_ of the same protoplast is shown . in figure coordinating lines show the localization of in more detail . a higher magnification of the same protoplast enabled visualization of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and indicated an association of with the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . however the limited resolution of the _PROTEIN_ and the extensive emission of the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ made a final conclusion with respect to the subcellular localization of difficult . transmission electron immunomicroscopy was used to investigate the subcellular localization further . protoplasts were transformed with _METHOD_ n using a transient _PROTEIN_ system and then incubated with antibodies directed against _METHOD_ and the secondary antibody was labeled with gold particles . the transmission images show an association of protein with the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and to a smaller extent localization in the stroma of the chloroplasts . the statistical analysis of the density of gold labeling in the chloroplasts indicates an effective transformation . in mitochondria only a total of gold particles were found in the profiles of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ from protoplasts just gold particles were detected . in an area of of cytoplasm gold particles were counted . in chloroplasts with an area of gold particles were found . more than of the gold label in chloroplast was associated with the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ the remaining in stroma . as controls for the specificity of the attachment sections were incubated either in the absence of the _METHOD_ specific antibody or with preimmune serum . less than gold particle per was seen in these control sections . only a few areas around some _LOCATION_ displayed or gold particles above this background . however this compartment is known as having relatively high unspecific affinity . summary of the data of the immunolabeling studies several computer _METHOD_ using different _METHOD_ for the prediction of the intracellular localization of proteins were applied . the results of the prediction by computer _METHOD_ are summarized in table ii . for three out of six proteins the localization predictions were in agreement with the experimental results . for these proteins the probabilities given by both _METHOD_ psort and targetp were very high . however results in targetp for suggested a dual targeting into mitochondria and chloroplasts . the prediction probabilities for the other three proteins gave lower values except for a chloroplast stroma localization of in psort . in the case of these lower certainties for the prediction the experimental data gave completely different results .
