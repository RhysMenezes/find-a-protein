the brassinosteroid phytohormones play crucial roles in regulating plant cell growth and morphogenesis particularly in hypocotyl cell elongation . the microtubule _LOCATION_ is also known to participate in the regulation of hypocotyl elongation . however it is unclear if br regulation of hypocotyl elongation involves the microtubule _LOCATION_ . in this study we demonstrate that brs mediate hypocotyl cell elongation by influencing the orientation and stability of cortical microtubules . further analysis identified the previously undiscovered arabidopsis thaliana microtubule destabilizing _PROTEIN_ as a positive regulator of hypocotyl cell elongation . brassinazole a key transcription _PROTEIN_ in the br signaling pathway directly targets and upregulates _PROTEIN_ . overexpression of _PROTEIN_ partially rescued the shorter hypocotyl phenotype in br deficient mutant de etiolated seedlings . reorientation of the cortical microtubules in the cells of _PROTEIN_ rna interference transgenic lines was less sensitive to br . these findings demonstrate that _PROTEIN_ is a key regulator in br regulation of cortical microtubule reorientation and mediates hypocotyl growth . this study reveals a mechanism involving br regulation of microtubules through _PROTEIN_ to mediate hypocotyl cell elongation .
arabidopsis lines consisting of etiolated br deficient _PROTEIN_ mutants and the null allele of the br receptor mutant _PROTEIN_ with a yellow _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ tubulin background were generated to test for br regulation of cortical microtubule orientation . treatments were performed with brassinolide which is the most active br . confocal observations showed that most cortical microtubules exhibited oblique and longitudinal orientations in the epidermal cells of the etiolated hypocotyls of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ seedlings . after treatment with bl for min the cortical microtubules were transversely reoriented to the longitudinal hypocotyl growth axis in _PROTEIN_ mutant cells but not in the _PROTEIN_ mutant cells demonstrating that reorientation of the cortical microtubules in etiolated hypocotyls cells is regulated by br signaling . the underlying mechanism of br reorientation of the cortical microtubules was evaluated by investigating br regulation of cortical microtubule stability in hypocotyl cells using the microtubule disrupting drug oryzalin . to quantify the effects of oryzalin on the stability of cortical microtubules in _PROTEIN_ mutants following treatment with bl the density of cortical microtubules in etiolated hypocotyl epidermal cells was estimated as previously reported . most of the cortical microtubules disappeared in the epidermal cells pretreated with bl in the presence of oryzalin for min while the microtubules in the cells that were not treated with bl were largely unaffected . increasing the duration of oryzalin treatment resulted in the disappearance of most of the cortical microtubules in the cells pretreated with bl . however the cortical microtubules remained relatively unaffected in the cells that were not treated with bl . these results demonstrate that treatment with br increases the sensitivity of cortical microtubules to oryzalin . many br related mutants exhibit abnormal etiolated hypocotyl elongation . br deficient _PROTEIN_ mutants have shorter etiolated hypocotyls while br perceptional _PROTEIN_ mutants have longer etiolated hypocotyls . we examined the relationship between the stability of cortical microtubules and those phenotypes . the cortical microtubules in d old etiolated hypocotyl epidermal cells _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants with a _METHOD_ tubulin background were observed using confocal microscopy and oryzalin was used to test the stability of the microtubules . the density of cortical microtubules in hypocotyl epidermal cells was analyzed to quantify the effects of oryzalin on the stability of cortical microtubules in the mutant seedlings . the densities of the cortical microtubules in the wild type _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ epidermal cells before treatment were not significantly different . however the density of cortical microtubules in the wild type _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ epidermal cells was significantly different following treatment . the microtubules were disrupted in the _PROTEIN_ epidermal cells following treatment with oryzalin for min while the microtubules in the wild type and _PROTEIN_ cells were relatively unaffected . increasing the oryzalin concentration and duration of treatment resulted in the disappearance of most of the cortical microtubules in the wild type and _PROTEIN_ cells although the cortical microtubules remained relatively unaffected in the _PROTEIN_ mutant cells . the results of this experiment showed that microtubules in _PROTEIN_ cells were more sensitive to the oryzalin treatment compared with the _PROTEIN_ mutant cells . _PROTEIN_ plays a central role in br regulation of plant growth . many potential br regulated and _PROTEIN_ target genes have been identified using _PROTEIN_ followed by microarray _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . the gene we named _PROTEIN_ herein was predicted to be a _PROTEIN_ target gene and encodes a putative microtubule associated protein . we tested the direct binding of _PROTEIN_ to the promoter of _PROTEIN_ with electrophoretic mobility shift assays _METHOD_ using n hydroxysuccinimide biotin labeled dna fragments of the _PROTEIN_ promoter and bacterially _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ proteins fused to the maltose binding protein . the result showed that the mbp _PROTEIN_ fusion protein bound to the to region but not the to region of the _PROTEIN_ promoter . when unlabeled probe was added to the system as competitor the band was suppressed indicating that _PROTEIN_ can directly bind to the _PROTEIN_ promoter in vitro . to determine whether _PROTEIN_ binds to the _PROTEIN_ promoter in vivo _PROTEIN_ experiments were performed . the his _PROTEIN_ myc fusion protein was _PROTEIN_ using the promoter and immunoprecipitated using an antibody recognizing the myc tag . the genomic dna fragments that coimmunoprecipitated with his _PROTEIN_ myc were analyzed using pcr . _PROTEIN_ a known _PROTEIN_ target gene and ubiquitin conjugating enzyme _PROTEIN_ a known _PROTEIN_ nontarget gene were used as controls . dna precipitated without the anti myc antibody was subjected to pcr amplification and _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ bands were not detected . an obvious _PROTEIN_ band was amplified from the dna that coprecipitated with the anti myc antibody . similar results were obtained for _PROTEIN_ but not _PROTEIN_ demonstrating that _PROTEIN_ is a _PROTEIN_ target gene . we analyzed _PROTEIN_ regulation of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . the dominant _PROTEIN_ mutation causes constitutive _PROTEIN_ activation due to enhanced dephosphorylation by _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ target genes are constitutively activated in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . if _PROTEIN_ is a _PROTEIN_ upregulated gene a higher _PROTEIN_ level of _PROTEIN_ is expected in _PROTEIN_ mutants . to test this possibility rna was purified from etiolated hypocotyls of the _PROTEIN_ mutant and quantitative real time pcr analysis was performed . the _PROTEIN_ level of _PROTEIN_ was much higher in the _PROTEIN_ mutant than in the wild type indicating that _PROTEIN_ is a _PROTEIN_ upregulated gene . we tested whether brs are capable of regulating the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ . the br deficient mutant _PROTEIN_ was treated with bl . quantitative real time pcr showed that the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ was induced by bl treatment with the peak level detected h after treatment . these results indicate that _PROTEIN_ directly activates the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ . the localization of _PROTEIN_ was investigated in arabidopsis cells . a construct encoding _PROTEIN_ with a c terminal green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ tag driven by a promoter was constructed and transiently introduced into cells . confocal microscopy showed that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ formed filamentous structures in pavement cells . the filament structures were disrupted by treatment with the microtubule disrupting reagent oryzalin but were nearly intact in the presence of lata a reagent that depolymerizes actin filaments . f actin was visualized by transiently _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in cells and the lata treatment was shown to disrupt most of the f actin in the pavement cells . similar phenomena were also observed in arabidopsis cells stably _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ suggesting that this structure is related to microtubules but not f actin . in addition time lapse imaging was performed to track _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and the results showed that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was relatively stationary in the cells . to confirm this result we transiently coexpressed _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and mbd mcherry into arabidopsis pavement cells . the green _METHOD_ signal of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ overlapped with the red _METHOD_ signal of mbd mcherry as shown in figures to . a plot of the signal intensity analysis using imagej software is shown in figure . these data demonstrate that _PROTEIN_ colocalizes with cortical microtubules in vivo . because knockdown or knockout t dna insertion lines of _PROTEIN_ are unavailable rna interference lines were generated to analyze the function of _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis . of the _PROTEIN_ rnai transgenic lines that were obtained showed a shorter etiolated hypocotyl . line which exhibited a typical phenotype was selected for further analyses . the level of _PROTEIN_ transcription was considerably reduced in this rnai line . because _PROTEIN_ shares high amino acid identity with the putative microtubule associated protein in the arabidopsis genome we detected the _PROTEIN_ of in the _PROTEIN_ rnai line . rt pcr showed that the level of rna in the _PROTEIN_ rnai line was similar to the _PROTEIN_ level in the wild type demonstrating that the _PROTEIN_ of was not affected in the _PROTEIN_ rnai line . the hypocotyl length in d old etiolated seedlings from the _PROTEIN_ rnai line was dramatically reduced . no major differences in the cell profiles of the etiolated hypocotyls were observed between the _PROTEIN_ rnai line and the wild type . the cell numbers of an epidermal cell file of hypocotyls in the _PROTEIN_ rnai line and the wild type were similar . the cell lengths in different regions of etiolated hypocotyls in the _PROTEIN_ rnai line were much shorter than in the wild type particularly in the middle region . statistical analysis using paired student s t test indicated that this difference was significant . to confirm that the hypocotyl phenotype in the _PROTEIN_ rnai line was linked to _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ levels we randomly selected four additional rnai lines for rt pcr analysis . the results showed that the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ levels were associated with the short etiolated hypocotyl phenotype . we made a second _PROTEIN_ rnai construct using another _PROTEIN_ cdna sequence . nineteen _PROTEIN_ rnai lines exhibited a shorter etiolated hypocotyl phenotype and two independent _PROTEIN_ rnai lines were selected for further analyses . the results showed that the transcription levels of _PROTEIN_ and the hypocotyl length in d old etiolated seedlings from the _PROTEIN_ rnai lines were dramatically reduced . these results confirm that the shorter etiolated hypocotyl phenotype in the _PROTEIN_ rnai lines is dependent on the _PROTEIN_ level of _PROTEIN_ . therefore _PROTEIN_ plays a positive regulatory role in hypocotyl cell elongation . the precise region of growth during hypocotyl development has been well defined . for example the five basal hypocotyl cells stop growing from day to day after germination in the dark while the cells in the upper region of the hypocotyl begin to expand . proteins that play a positive role in hypocotyl growth are expected to be highly _PROTEIN_ in the upper region but not at the basal region in etiolated hypocotyls . the _PROTEIN_ pattern of _PROTEIN_ was explored by determining the promoter activity using _PROTEIN_ as a reporter . rt pcr and gus staining showed that _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ in most of the tissues and organs of arabidopsis particularly in the cotyledon and hypocotyls suggesting it may play a role in regulating hypocotyl growth . detection of gus activity in etiolated seedlings revealed that _PROTEIN_ was primarily _PROTEIN_ in the upper region of the hypocotyls after to d in the dark which is considered to be a fast growing region after d . to verify this result rna was purified from the basal and upper regions of hypocotyls from wild type seedlings grown in the dark for d. rt pcr showed that _PROTEIN_ was weakly _PROTEIN_ in the basal region but more abundant in the upper region of etiolated hypocotyls which demonstrates that _PROTEIN_ functions as a positive regulator of hypocotyl elongation . because our results show that _PROTEIN_ is a _PROTEIN_ target and br upregulated gene we hypothesized that overexpression of _PROTEIN_ could rescue the short hypocotyl phenotype induced by a deficiency of br . twenty eight br deficient _PROTEIN_ mutant lines that overexpress _PROTEIN_ were generated and line was used for analysis . rt pcr showed that the transcription level of _PROTEIN_ was considerably enhanced in the line that overexpressed _PROTEIN_ . overexpression of _PROTEIN_ dramatically increased the etiolated hypocotyl length of _PROTEIN_ mutants in d old etiolated seedlings . scanning electronic microscopy revealed that the cell length of etiolated hypocotyls in _PROTEIN_ mutants was increased when the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ was enhanced demonstrating that _PROTEIN_ is a downstream _PROTEIN_ in the br signaling pathway and affects hypocotyl elongation . because _PROTEIN_ colocalizes with cortical microtubules in the cell this protein may regulate the cortical microtubule array in hypocotyl cells . because the orientation of cortical microtubule patterns are related to the elongation rate of etiolated hypocotyl epidermal cells etiolated hypocotyls are used to examine the correlation between cell elongation and cortical microtubule organization . to test this possibility we observed cortical microtubules in hypocotyl epidermal cells of _PROTEIN_ rnai transgenic arabidopsis with a _METHOD_ tubulin background . after h of growth in the dark parallel arrays of cortical microtubules were generally transversely oriented to the longitudinal hypocotyl growth axis in the upper and middle regions of the wild type etiolated hypocotyls . by contrast random oblique or longitudinal cortical microtubules were observed in most of the _PROTEIN_ rnai arabidopsis hypocotyl cells which is consistent with the significant inhibition of etiolated hypocotyl cell elongation and reduced _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ . to determine the effects of _PROTEIN_ on cortical microtubule mediated hypocotyl cell elongation wild type and _PROTEIN_ rnai epidermal hypocotyl cells were treated with the microtubule disrupting drug oryzalin . the epidermal cells in the middle region were used to compare the stability of the cortical microtubules because _PROTEIN_ is strongly _PROTEIN_ in the middle region of etiolated hypocotyls . the density of cortical microtubules in hypocotyl epidermal cells was measured to quantify the effects of oryzalin on the stability of cortical microtubules in the wild type and _PROTEIN_ rnai lines . the results revealed that the density of cortical microtubules in the epidermal cells of the wild type was similar to the density in _PROTEIN_ rnai lines before treatment . however the densities were significantly different after the drug treatment . the cortical microtubules were disrupted in the wild type epidermal cells treated with oryzalin for min while the microtubules in _PROTEIN_ rnai cells were largely unaffected . increased oryzalin concentration and duration of treatment resulted in the disruption of most of the cortical microtubules in the wild type cells . however cortical microtubules still remained in the _PROTEIN_ rnai cells . when the oryzalin was washed off after the treatment most of the cortical microtubules recovered in the epidermal cells of the _PROTEIN_ rnai cells but not in the wild type cells . thus the microtubules in the _PROTEIN_ rnai cells were less sensitive to the oryzalin treatment when the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ was reduced . those results demonstrate that _PROTEIN_ functions as a microtubule destabilizer . microtubule dynamics were further analyzed using confocal time lapse imaging . microtubules with clearly visible leading plus ends were selected for measurement in the wild type and _PROTEIN_ rnai arabidopsis cells . the results showed that the parameters of microtubule dynamics were altered in the _PROTEIN_ rnai etiolated hypocotyl epidermal cells . the average growth rate of the leading ends of the microtubules was in _PROTEIN_ rnai arabidopsis cells and in wild type cells . the rescue frequency of individual microtubules in _PROTEIN_ rnai arabidopsis cells was significantly higher than the frequency in wild type cells suggesting that individual microtubules are more prone to growth in the absence of _PROTEIN_ . because _PROTEIN_ plays a positive role in br mediated hypocotyl growth we investigated the effects of _PROTEIN_ on the regulation of cortical microtubules in response to br . the wild type and _PROTEIN_ rnai arabidopsis seedlings were grown for d in the dark on half strength murashige and skoog _METHOD_ medium containing brassinazole which specifically blocks br biosynthesis at the c hydroxylation step and _PROTEIN_ endogenous br and bl treatments were performed . after d of growth in the dark parallel arrays of cortical microtubules were longitudinally oriented to the hypocotyl growth axis in the epidermal cells of the wild type and _PROTEIN_ rnai etiolated hypocotyls . after treatment with bl for min transverse cortical microtubules were observed in the hypocotyl cells of the wild type seedlings but not in the _PROTEIN_ rnai arabidopsis cells . increasing the duration of treatment induced dominantly transverse cortical microtubules in the wild type cells but not in the _PROTEIN_ rnai line indicating that cortical microtubule reorientation was hindered in _PROTEIN_ rnai cells in response to bl treatment . cortical microtubule arrays in the wild type and rnai lines did not exhibit differences after the cells were treated with mock buffer for min . this demonstrates that _PROTEIN_ is necessary for br regulated cortical microtubule reorientation .
