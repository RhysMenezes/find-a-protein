following prenylation the proteins are subject to two prenyl dependent modifications at their c terminal end which are required for their subcellular targeting . first the three c terminal residues of the caax box prenylation signaling motif are removed which is followed by methylation of the free _PROTEIN_ group of the prenyl cysteine moiety . anarabidopsis homologue of the yeast caaxprotease _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was cloned and _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutant yeast to demonstrate functional complementation . the petunia calmodulin _PROTEIN_ is a prenylated protein terminating in a ctil caax box . coupled methylation proteolysis assays demonstrated the processing of _PROTEIN_ by _PROTEIN_ . in addition _PROTEIN_ promoted _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ association of the _METHOD_ protein which terminates with a cllm caax box . interestingly a plant homologue of the second and major caax protease in yeast and animal cells _PROTEIN_ was not identified despite the availability of vast amounts of sequence data . taken together these data suggest that _PROTEIN_ may process several prenylated proteins in plant cells unlike its yeast homologue which processes only a mating _PROTEIN_ and its mammalian homologue for which prenyl caax substrates have not been established . transient _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ in leaf epidermal cells ofnicotiana benthamiana showed that _PROTEIN_ is exclusively localized in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ suggesting that prenylated proteins in plants are first targeted to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ following their prenylation .
yeast and human _PROTEIN_ amino acid sequences were used to search thearabidopsis data base . a genomic sequence of bp from chromosome with a deduced bp cdna showing high homology to both yeast and human _PROTEIN_ was identified . we termed this gene _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ cdna was cloned from a flower cdna library using a pcr based approach with oligonucleotide primers designed according to the genomic sequence . the pcr amplification yielded a bp fragment which was bp longer than the sequence predicted by the arabidopsis genome initiative . using the same primers in an rt pcr reaction a bp fragment was also amplified from a col poly rna . sequence analysis showed that the discrepancy between our results and the arabidopsisgenome initiative predictions were caused by two exons that had previously been misinterpreted as introns and also by a short sequence of bp which had been misinterpreted as an exon . _PROTEIN_ cdna encodes a protein consisting of amino acid residues with a calculated molecular _METHOD_ of kda . the amino acid sequence showed and identity with yeast and human _PROTEIN_ proteins respectively . hydropathy plot analysis showed that _PROTEIN_ is predicted to have seven _LOCATION_ spanning domains . _PROTEIN_ possesses two conserved sequence motifs hexxh which is a signature of zinc metalloproteases and a c terminal kkxx the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ retention signal . the apparent sequence similarity between _PROTEIN_ and its yeast and mammalian homologues suggests that it could function as a caax protease . this prediction although likely to be confirmed required further functional analysis . real time rt pcr was used to determine the _PROTEIN_ pattern of _PROTEIN_ and prove that it is an arabidopsis gene . total rna was isolated from the leaf stem and flower tissues and used to make cdna by means of reverse transcriptase . real time pcr with gene specific primers was used to determine the relative levels of rna in each tissue . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ levels were normalized against the level of ubiquitin which was amplified from the same rnas . the results showed that _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ ubiquitously throughout the plant with _PROTEIN_ levels slightly higher in flowers . the melting curves of the real time pcr reaction showed that a single product was amplified in all of the reactions . this conclusion is further supported by the gel electrophoresis of the total reaction products where only a single band was detected in each of the reactions . the real time pcr reaction product migrated as kb products close to the calculated size of _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ was transiently _PROTEIN_ as a fusion protein with either _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ _METHOD_ to determine its subcellular localization in plants . _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was exclusively localized in polygonal net like structures when _PROTEIN_ in the epidermal cells of n. benthamiana . this subcellular localization of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ is very similar to that of the plant _LOCATION_ marker protein _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . to prove that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ localize to the same subcellular fraction _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ were coexpressed in the same cells . the colocalization data show that the two fusion proteins localized to the same fraction . the localization of both fusion proteins differs markedly from the localization of nonfused _METHOD_ which can be detected dispersed throughout the _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ . this distribution of free _METHOD_ is typical of plant cells . because of its size _METHOD_ diffuses through the _LOCATION_ pores and enters the _LOCATION_ unspecifically . in addition plant cells have large _LOCATION_ that encompass most of the cell volume . because of the _LOCATION_ in _METHOD_ and confocal microscope imaging the cytoplasm often appears as a diffuse line with invaginations circumventing cells and as strands crossing the cell . these combined data suggest that like its yeast homologue _PROTEIN_ is localized in the _LOCATION_ . to determine whether _PROTEIN_ is a functional homologue of the yeast _PROTEIN_ protease it was _PROTEIN_ in mutant _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ s. cerevisiae cells . complementation was tested by evaluating the relative levels of biologically activea _PROTEIN_ produced by mata strains in pheromone diffusion halo assays .a _PROTEIN_ produces a growth inhibition zone known as a halo when applied to a mat of mata cells because of the growth arrest of the latter at the _PROTEIN_ phase of the cell cycle . the size of the halo corresponds to the concentration ofa _PROTEIN_ and hence to the amount of active pheromone produced by the mata cells . for it to be exported and functional the amino acid a _PROTEIN_ precursor undergoes farnesylation proteolytic trimming of the aax moiety by either _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and two n terminal proteolytic cleavage events the first of which is catalyzed by _PROTEIN_ . thus the amount of active a _PROTEIN_ and the corresponding halo size depend directly on the _PROTEIN_ activity . the halos formed around the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutants that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ from a high copy number plasmid were somewhat smaller than those formed around the wild type cells . the halos were even smaller when _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ from a low copycen plasmid . no halos were formed around untransformed _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ cells around cells transformed with vectors alone and following plasmid loss . these results show that _PROTEIN_ is a functional homologue of the yeast _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ contains a conserved hexxh metalloprotease signature . to determine whether this motif is required for enzymatic activity we mutated to alanine to obtain a mutated protein with an aexxh motif . the mutant _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ cells to examine complementation by pheromone diffusion halo assay . mutant cells that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ failed to induce halos . control experiments showed that halos were formed around either wt or mutant _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ cells that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and that no halos were formed around untransformed _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutant cells . yeast and human _PROTEIN_ proteases do not process ras proteins in vivo . however mutated a _PROTEIN_ harboring the ciis caax box can be processed by yeast _PROTEIN_ . these data suggest that a conserved mechanism prevents ras proteins from being processed by _PROTEIN_ . moreover attempts to identify _PROTEIN_ homologues in plants have so far been implying that _PROTEIN_ may be the only prenyl caax protease in plants . it was therefore crucial to determine whether _PROTEIN_ could process ras proteins . to do so we tested the ability of _PROTEIN_ to support yeast ras function in vivo . activated alleles of ras induce a heat shock sensitivity phenotype in yeast that is dependent upon post translational processing of the ras c terminus . _PROTEIN_ failed to confer heat shock sensitivity when _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ cells that _PROTEIN_ an activated allele of _PROTEIN_ indicating that _PROTEIN_ can not substitute functionally for _PROTEIN_ the yeast ras caax protease . can _PROTEIN_ process different prenylated proteins or is it similar to its yeast and mammalian homologues that only process a _PROTEIN_ ? to answer this question we examined whether _PROTEIN_ could process two prenylated proteins . one protein is a prenylated calmodulin from petunia called _PROTEIN_ . the other protein is a rac like _PROTEIN_ called _PROTEIN_ . the processing of _PROTEIN_ by _PROTEIN_ was examined by coupled methylation proteolysis assays . in these assays prenylated unprocessed _PROTEIN_ was incubated with protein extracts containing both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ together with adomet as a methyl group donor . _PROTEIN_ of prenylated _PROTEIN_ could only occur after processing by a caax protease . indeed _PROTEIN_ methylation was detected following incubation with yeast protein extracts containing either _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ . counts obtained with protein extracts prepared from mutant _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ cells were of the counts obtained with extracts prepared from wt _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ cells . the reactions with extracts prepared _METHOD_ strain that lacks _PROTEIN_ gave similar counts to reactions with extracts prepared from _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ cells . taken together these results show that _PROTEIN_ could process _PROTEIN_ . to further examine the substrate specificity of _PROTEIN_ a rac like _PROTEIN_ termed which terminates with a cllm caax box was _PROTEIN_ in yeast fused to _METHOD_ . in wild type _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ cells _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was detected in the endomembranes and _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . a _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant cells was localized almost exclusively in the endomembranes . _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in the double mutant cells promoted _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ association of the fusion protein similar to its distribution in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ type cells . _METHOD_ was localized _PROTEIN_ in the endomembranes when _PROTEIN_ in an _PROTEIN_ strain containing the yeast _PROTEIN_ . as with wt cells the fusion protein was detected both in endomembrane and in _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ when _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ cells that contain _PROTEIN_ . a nonprenylatable _METHOD_ _METHOD_ mutant in which the prenyl acceptor cysteine had been changed into serine was dispersed throughout the cytoplasm . collectively these results suggest that the yeast _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ differ in their substrate specificities . whereas _PROTEIN_ can only processa _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is able to process different prenylated proteins both in vitro and in vivo .
