most transcription _PROTEIN_ fulfill their role in complexes and regulate their target genes upon binding to dna motifs located in upstream regions or introns . to date knowledge about transcription _PROTEIN_ target genes and their corresponding transcription _PROTEIN_ binding sites are still very limited . two related methods that allow in vivo identification of transcription _PROTEIN_ binding sites are chromatin immunoprecipitation _PROTEIN_ and chromatin affinity purification . for chap the protein of interest is tagged with a peptide or protein which can be used for affinity purification of the protein dna complex and hence the identification of the target gene . here we present the results of experiments aiming at the development of a generic tagging approach for the arabidopsis mads domain proteins _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . for this arabidopsis wild type plants were transformed with constructs containing a mads box gene fused to either a double strep ii _PROTEIN_ tag a triple ha tag or an _METHOD_ tag all under the control of the constitutive double cauliflower mosaic virus promoter . strikingly in all cases the number of transformants with loss of function phenotypes was much larger than those with an overexpression phenotype . using endogenous promoters in stead of the camv resulted in a dramatic reduction in the frequency of loss of function phenotypes . furthermore pleiotropic defects occasionally caused by an overexpression strategy can be overcome by using the native promoter of the gene . finally a chap result is presented using _METHOD_ antibody on plants carrying a genomic fragment of a mads box gene fused to _METHOD_ . this study revealed that mads box proteins are very sensitive to fusions with small peptide tags and _METHOD_ tags . furthermore for the _PROTEIN_ of chimeric versions of mads box genes it is favorable to use the entire genomic region in frame to the tag of choice . interestingly though unexpected it appears that the use of chimeric versions of mads box genes under the control of the strong camv promoter is a very efficient method to obtain dominant negative mutants either caused by cosuppression or by alteration of the activity of the recombinant protein . finally we were able to demonstrate _PROTEIN_ binding to one of its targets by chap .
four different binary vectors were used for the tagging approach in plants . the first vector contains a double tag the strep ii _PROTEIN_ followed by the _PROTEIN_ tag _PROTEIN_ located at the c terminus of the protein of interest . these peptide tags are both very small each only amino acids long . two other vectors contain the coding region for _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ which is either located at the n or c terminus of the protein of interest . the fourth vector contains a triple ha tag each encoding for a amino acids long peptide . furthermore all vectors have a constitutive double camv promoter to _PROTEIN_ the fusion products of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in transgenic arabidopsis plants . binary tagging vectors for plant protein _PROTEIN_ . c terminal fusion _PROTEIN_ vector with the strep ii and the _PROTEIN_ tag . n terminal fusion _PROTEIN_ vector with _METHOD_ . c terminal fusion _PROTEIN_ vector with _METHOD_ . n terminal fusion _PROTEIN_ vector with a triple ha tag . all vectors contain the constitutive camv promoter with the double enhancer for _PROTEIN_ . all constructs were introduced into arabidopsis wild type plants ecotype columbia and the transformants obtained were analyzed for overexpression phenotypes . the results are summarized in table and figure . the expected overexpression phenotypes for _PROTEIN_ are homeotic changes of floral organs resembling an like flower curly leaves and early flowering as described by . for ectopic _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ curly leaves and early flowering are characteristics to be expected while ectopic _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ results in siliques that fail to shatter because the dehiscence zone is absent _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . summary of tagged mads domain proteins in

observed in about of the plants when the _METHOD_ protein was fused either n or c terminally . surprisingly many plants containing an _METHOD_ fusion construct revealed a mutant phenotype . plants with either an overexpression phenotype or a mutant phenotype obtained with construct and were analyzed by northern blot hybridization for the _PROTEIN_ of the introduced _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ transgenes respectively . this revealed a perfect linkage between plants with an overexpression phenotype having a high ectopic gene _PROTEIN_ in leaves while plants with an ag mutant phenotype showed no _PROTEIN_ . in stead the latter plants exhibit a smear in the northern blot which is often observed when a gene is cosuppressed . remarkably for plants containing the _PROTEIN_ fusion construct no loss of function phenotypes were observed though the northern blot showed hallmarks of cosuppression suggesting that silencing of _PROTEIN_ may have occurred . most likely the paralogs and redundant genes _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are not affected which explains that no mutant phenotype was obtained . plants carrying the _PROTEIN_ fusion construct were not molecularly analyzed but mutant like plants in a range of severity were observed which suggest that also cosuppression had occurred . furthermore a few overexpression and mutant plants with the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ fused to _METHOD_ were analyzed for _METHOD_ and confirmed the same linkage between _PROTEIN_ and phenotype . northern blot analysis of leaf tissue of different arabidopsis lines containing various tagging

indicated with 'm and wt like plants with 'n . wt wild type line with an overexpression phenotype . plants transformed with constructs containing either the strep ii _PROTEIN_ tag or the triple ha tag displayed only a wild type or mutant phenotype . transgenic plants with construct containing the double strep ii _PROTEIN_ tag were also analyzed by northern blot for the _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ fusion product . remarkably in contrast to the _METHOD_ fusion constructs all plants with a loss of function phenotype revealed ectopic _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ which was lacking in plants with a wild type phenotype . this suggests that this mutant phenotype obtained with the double tag strep ii _PROTEIN_ tag is caused by a dominant negative effect and not by a cosuppression mechanism . the plants with the triple ha tag fusion constructs were analyzed by rt pcr . plants with a mutant phenotype reminiscent with ag or ful mutants revealed either no _PROTEIN_ suggesting cosuppression or overexpression suggesting a dominant negative effect respectively . the constitutive and strong double camv promoter resulted in high _PROTEIN_ of the transgene in those plants that showed an overexpression phenotype . however in the case of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ this promoter caused pleiotropic defects resulting in extremely small and early flowering plants with only a few flowers were produced . to overcome this problem the double camv promoter was replaced by the endogenous promoter . a kb fragment upstream the _PROTEIN_ start codon of _PROTEIN_ was fused to the _PROTEIN_ reporter gene encoding for gus . gus staining in transgenic arabidopsis plants was detected in the three inner whorls of the flower where _PROTEIN_ is normally _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . however gus signal was also detected in the sepals pedicels and even in cauline and rosette leaves suggesting that the upstream region of _PROTEIN_ is lacking cis acting regulatory regions for correct _PROTEIN_ . similar misexpression was observed for the mads box genes _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ when only the dna region upstream the first intron or the _PROTEIN_ respectively was fused to the gus reporter gene . in the case of _PROTEIN_ it appeared that the second intron which contains various cis acting regulatory elements was essential for the right spatial _PROTEIN_ pattern while for correct _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ the first intron should be included in the reporter constructs . when the _PROTEIN_ first intron sequence was analyzed in detail different motifs were identified that might act as cis regulatory elements including a perfect carg box . to investigate the importance of the _PROTEIN_ intron sequences a kb genomic fragment of _PROTEIN_ including upstream and intron sequences was fused to a _METHOD_ tag and introduced into arabidopsis plants . in contrast to the observed misexpression when only the _PROTEIN_ upstream region was used correct spatial and temporal _PROTEIN_ was obtained when also the _PROTEIN_ intron sequences were included . the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ is predominantly visible in the _LOCATION_ of the floral meristem cells of floral buds from stage onwards while there is no or minimal _PROTEIN_ in the rest of the inflorescence . noteworthy the number of observed loss of function phenotypes with an endogenous mads box gene promoter is dramatically less than in the case with the camv promoter or even absent in the case of _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ analysis and chromatin immunoprecipitation _PROTEIN_ . confocal scanning laser microscopical imaging of gag

meristem wt wild type . in summary the reported results with _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and our results with _PROTEIN_ indicate that intron regions in mads domain genes are important for correct spatial and temporal _PROTEIN_ . to investigate whether the chap procedure using tags is feasible we used transgenic arabidopsis plants _PROTEIN_ gag _METHOD_ as example . correct spatial and temporal _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was observed predominantly in the _LOCATION_ of the floral meristem cells of floral buds from stage onwards . first we analyzed the gag _METHOD_ plants by western blotting to see whether the chimeric _PROTEIN_ protein is detectable with a polyclonal _METHOD_ antibody . for this protein was isolated from _LOCATION_ extracts from wild type arabidopsis plants and compared with extracts from gag _METHOD_ plants . the western blot shows a specific band of the expected size in the gag _METHOD_ plants which was not present in wild type plants . finally a chromatin affinity purification with a _METHOD_ antibody was performed on a protein extract derived from gag _METHOD_ plants . as reported before _PROTEIN_ protein is able to bind to its own intron sequence for autoregulation . this regulatory region was analyzed for enrichment by real time pcr which would demonstrate that the chimeric _PROTEIN_ protein is able to bind in vivo to its target sequence . the target dna sequence _PROTEIN_ was fold enriched after affinity purification with _METHOD_ antibody demonstrating that chimeric _PROTEIN_ is indeed able to bind to its regulatory region .
