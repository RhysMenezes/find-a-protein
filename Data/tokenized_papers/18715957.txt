chloroplasts change their intracellular distribution in response to light intensity . previously we isolated the chloroplast unusual _PROTEIN_ mutant of arabidopsis . this mutant is defective in normal chloroplast relocation movement and shows aggregation of chloroplasts at the bottom of palisade mesophyll cells . the isolated gene encodes a protein with an actin binding motif . here we used biochemical analyses to determine the subcellular localization of full length _PROTEIN_ on the chloroplast outer envelope . a _PROTEIN_ green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ fusion which was detected at the outermost part of mesophyll cell chloroplasts complemented the _PROTEIN_ phenotype but _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ which was localized _PROTEIN_ in the _LOCATION_ did not . overexpression of the n terminal hydrophobic region of _PROTEIN_ fused with _METHOD_ _METHOD_ induced a _PROTEIN_ like phenotype indicating a dominant negative effect on chloroplast relocation movement . a similar pattern was found in chloroplast outer envelope _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transformants and a protein containing _PROTEIN_ in place of nthr complemented the mutant phenotype . physiological analyses of transgenic arabidopsis plants _PROTEIN_ truncated _PROTEIN_ in a _PROTEIN_ mutant background and cytoskeletal inhibitor experiments showed that the coiled coil region of _PROTEIN_ anchors chloroplasts firmly on the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ consistent with the localization of coiled coil _METHOD_ on the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . thus _PROTEIN_ localization on chloroplasts with the n terminus inserted into the chloroplast outer envelope and the c terminus facing the _LOCATION_ is essential for _PROTEIN_ function and the coiled coil region of _PROTEIN_ prevents chloroplast aggregation and participates in chloroplast relocation movement .
to determine the subcellular localization of the full length _PROTEIN_ biochemically we performed immunoblot analyses of whole leaves and isolated chloroplasts using two different polyclonal antibodies one against the n terminal to amino acids and the other against the c terminal to amino acids of _PROTEIN_ . a specific _PROTEIN_ band of approximately kd was detected with both anti _PROTEIN_ antibodies in whole leaf extracts of wild type plants but not in extracts of _PROTEIN_ plants . the _PROTEIN_ signal was also detected in the purified chloroplast fraction from wild type plants . interestingly _PROTEIN_ protein was not detected after treatment of isolated chloroplasts with the protease thermolysin . the transport protein _PROTEIN_ which is also sensitive to thermolysin is localized on the chloroplast outer envelope and known to project into the cytoplasm suggesting that _PROTEIN_ may also be located on the chloroplast surface . to confirm the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ we generated transgenic plants stably _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fused to the n terminus _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ or c terminus _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ of _PROTEIN_ under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus promoter on the _PROTEIN_ background . an immunoblot analysis using whole leaf extracts of transgenic plants confirmed that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ accumulated to the levels of endogenous _PROTEIN_ in the wild type although the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were detected as different sizes . _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was not detected in an isolated chloroplast fraction . analyses of intracellular chloroplast distribution under various light conditions revealed that the transgenic lines _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ showed normal chloroplast relocation but _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ could not complement the _PROTEIN_ phenotype . although the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was faint _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was observed at the periphery of chloroplasts and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was not . the localization observed is consistent with the results of the immunoblot analyses . to investigate the chloroplast targeting region of _PROTEIN_ we used particle bombardment to transiently _PROTEIN_ various fragments of _PROTEIN_ fused to _METHOD_ in leaf cells of wild type plants . two types of _METHOD_ patterns were observed one surrounding chloroplasts and the other _LOCATION_ . _PROTEIN_ fragments containing the n terminal hydrophobic region were fused to the n terminus of _METHOD_ to form _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . all were detected at the periphery of the chloroplasts consistent with the distribution of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in figure . _PROTEIN_ fragments were then fused to the c terminus of _METHOD_ to form _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ all were detected in _LOCATION_ . this result was consistent with the distribution of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in stably _PROTEIN_ transgenic lines shown in figure but neither _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ nor _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was observed in the transiently _PROTEIN_ plants . to clarify which parts or amino acids among amino acids in nthr were necessary for the localization we constructed various deletion constructs deleted from either the n terminal or c terminal side of nthr fused with _METHOD_ and transiently _PROTEIN_ them in leaf palisade mesophyll cells . almost all amino acids tested were necessary for targeting nthr _METHOD_ fragments to chloroplasts . next we compared the amino acid sequence of the arabidopsis nthr with those of _PROTEIN_ orthologs from rice fern and moss . we found that the nthr of all of the orthologs contained large hydrophobic residues and some charged and _PROTEIN_ amino acids such as arg and ser as consensus amino acids . when nthr _METHOD_ of the _PROTEIN_ orthologs were _PROTEIN_ transiently in arabidopsis leaf cells _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was detected at the periphery of chloroplasts for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ but not _PROTEIN_ . to investigate the importance of the consensus amino acids arg ser and arg each modified nthr sequence fused to _METHOD_ was transiently _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis leaf cells . _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was found at the periphery of chloroplasts when one of these amino acids in the nthr was changed to ala whereas the _METHOD_ was found in the _LOCATION_ when two or all three of these amino acids were changed . to address the correlation between nthr and chloroplast distribution nthr _METHOD_ was _PROTEIN_ stably under the control of the camv promoter in wild type cells of arabidopsis . transgenic lines were classified into three groups according to the _PROTEIN_ level of nthr _METHOD_ . in the highly _PROTEIN_ lines endogenous _PROTEIN_ was detected as the same level as in wild type plants . _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was found at the periphery of chloroplasts in all transgenic lines however chloroplasts in these transgenic lines showed abnormal positioning and aggregation even under weak light conditions . the chloroplast distribution became more abnormal as the nthr _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ level increased and chloroplast positioning in the highly _PROTEIN_ line was similar to that in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . these results suggest that excessively _PROTEIN_ nthr _METHOD_ disturbs the function of _PROTEIN_ by competing with authentic _PROTEIN_ to target chloroplasts that is it has a dominant negative effect . to confirm this hypothesis we performed a similar experiment with _PROTEIN_ outer envelope _PROTEIN_ which inserts its n terminus into the outer envelope and exposes its c terminus to the _LOCATION_ . a construct of the _PROTEIN_ targeting signal fused to _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was introduced into wild type plants . the sequence of the targeting signal region of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ shows very low similarity to the nthr sequence although both sequences have hydrophobic regions . nevertheless in the transgenic plants chloroplasts aggregated and _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was observed at the periphery of chloroplasts consistent with the pattern seen with nthr _METHOD_ . we next examined whether the amino acid sequence of nthr is essential for _PROTEIN_ function by replacing the nthr of _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ . genes encoding the full length _PROTEIN_ or two _PROTEIN_ modified at the n terminus _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ mutant plants under the control of the camv promoter . the transcript of each construct in each transgenic line was confirmed by reverse transcription pcr with specific primers . endogenous _PROTEIN_ exogenous _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were _PROTEIN_ at their predicted sizes as confirmed by immunoblot analysis but _PROTEIN_ was not . it is possible that _PROTEIN_ was degraded because it was not localized to the correct position the chloroplast outer envelope . we then tested whether the mutant phenotypes were complemented by these constructs under various light conditions . chloroplasts in transgenic lines _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ showed normal chloroplast relocation similar to that of the wild type plants under all light conditions tested but chloroplasts in the _PROTEIN_ transgenic lines did not . these results indicate that the presence of an n terminal region is essential for _PROTEIN_ function although the wild type sequence can be replaced with _PROTEIN_ . thus the localization of full length _PROTEIN_ at the chloroplast envelope is essential to its function in the chloroplast relocation machinery . _PROTEIN_ has various putative functional regions including an n terminal chloroplast targeting signal region a coiled coil region a filamentous actin binding region a pro rich region and a c terminal highly conserved region . however the roles of these regions in chloroplast relocation movement remain unknown . to examine whether these regions participate in the physiological regulation of chloroplast relocation we conjugated various types of truncated _PROTEIN_ to _METHOD_ and stably _PROTEIN_ these genes in _PROTEIN_ plants under the control of the camv promoter . an immunoblot analysis showed that these transgenes were _PROTEIN_ in each transgenic plant . however the calculated sizes of the accumulated _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ proteins in the transgenic lines _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were larger than the sizes estimated from the gene constructs . in contrast the transgenic line _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ showed a specific signal at the predicted size . next we investigated the physiological effects of these constructs on chloroplast relocation under various light conditions by observing chloroplast positioning focusing from top to bottom of the palisade mesophyll cells with a microscope . in wild type palisade mesophyll cells a few chloroplasts were localized to the surfaces of cells but mostly at the anticlinal position if they had been kept in the dark for h. after h in the dark most chloroplasts were localized to the cell bottom as reported previously . in contrast chloroplasts accumulated along the periclinal and anticlinal sides of palisade mesophyll cells under weak and strong light conditions respectively . on the other hand at all light intensities and even in the dark the chloroplasts of n c n c a and n c a p transgenic plants were positioned along the whole part of anticlinal sides of palisade mesophyll cells as observed for chloroplast positioning in the wild type plants under strong light conditions . the n p ct transgenic plant still showed the _PROTEIN_ phenotype . since all of these constructs except for n p ct contain the coiled coil region of _PROTEIN_ the function of the coiled coil region must be responsible for the chloroplast distribution along the anticlinal cell walls . to further examine whether chloroplasts in these transgenic lines respond to light we analyzed chloroplast relocation movement in n c a plants by time lapse imaging after microbeam irradiation . in cells of wild type plants chloroplasts moved toward the area irradiated with weak light but avoided the areas of strong light . however no chloroplast relocation movement was observed in cells of the n c a transgenic lines although the chloroplasts of the transgenic line looked firmly anchored to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ in any light conditions . the _PROTEIN_ that _PROTEIN_ does not contain the filamentous actin binding region raises the question of whether cytoskeletal components are involved in this chloroplast distribution . we tested whether treatment with cytoskeletal inhibitors would change the chloroplast distribution pattern under weak light in the transgenic lines . the chloroplast distribution pattern was not affected at all by latrunculin b and bdm in any line tested . to address the function of the coiled coil region for attaching chloroplasts to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ we transiently _PROTEIN_ three truncated n terminal regions of _PROTEIN_ fused with _METHOD_ in wild type cells . _METHOD_ _METHOD_ from _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was detected at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ in a pattern identical to that of the _METHOD_ of n phenyl hexatrienyl pyridinium dibromide which was used as a _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ marker . however the _METHOD_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was detected in the _LOCATION_ similar to the pattern of _METHOD_ as a control . _METHOD_ _METHOD_ from _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in palisade mesophyll cells was too weak to determine its subcellular localization . these results indicate that the coiled coil region of _PROTEIN_ interacts with the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ enabling _PROTEIN_ to bridge the chloroplast and the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ to anchor chloroplasts on the anticlinal side . to investigate the role of the coiled coil region of endogenous _PROTEIN_ in light dependent chloroplast relocation we observed the distribution patterns of chloroplasts in wild type _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and n c a lines under weak light conditions after treatment with the _LOCATION_ inhibitors latb and bdm . when these plants were kept in the dark for h chloroplasts gathered at the cell bottom in _PROTEIN_ cells but were located along the anticlinal _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ in the wild type _PROTEIN_ and transgenic n c a plants . in the wild type chloroplast accumulation at the periclinal _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ was usually observed after transferring the plants to weak light but the relocation movement was not observed after treatment with latb or bdm . no chloroplast relocalization was observed in _PROTEIN_ n c a and _PROTEIN_ plants irrespective of the presence of cytoskeletal inhibitors and even under weak light conditions . finally we observed chloroplast distribution under strong light in these plants . we observed chloroplast relocation from the avoidance to the accumulation positions only in wild type plants and this movement was prevented by the cytoskeletal inhibitors . these results indicate that chloroplast distributions in _PROTEIN_ and n c a leaves are determined by the coiled coil structure of endogenous _PROTEIN_ that is located along the anticlinal _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ .
