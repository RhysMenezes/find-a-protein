_LOCATION_ play central roles in plant growth development and stress responses . to better understand _LOCATION_ function and biogenesis we have characterized the vegetative _LOCATION_ proteome from arabidopsis thaliana . _LOCATION_ were isolated from protoplasts derived from rosette leaf tissue . total purified _LOCATION_ proteins were then subjected either to multidimensional liquid chromatography/tandem _METHOD_ _METHOD_ or to one dimensional _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ coupled with nano liquid chromatography/tandem _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . to ensure maximum coverage of the proteome a tonoplast enriched fraction was also analyzed separately by one dimensional _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ followed by nano lc _METHOD_ . cumulatively proteins were identified . the sensitivity of our analyses is indicated by the high coverage of _LOCATION_ proteins . eleven of the twelve known _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ subunits were identified . here we present evidence of four tonoplast localized soluble n ethylmaleimide sensitive _PROTEIN_ attachment protein receptors representing each of the four groups of snare proteins necessary for _LOCATION_ fusion . in addition potential cargo of the n and c terminal propeptide sorting pathways association of the _LOCATION_ with the _LOCATION_ and the _LOCATION_ localization of proteins of unknown function are identified . a detailed analysis of these proteins and their roles in _LOCATION_ function and biogenesis is presented .
of primary importance the purity of the starting samples was carefully considered . toward this end central _LOCATION_ were purified from mature leaves using a previously described method that was slightly modified . this method results in samples free of markers defining other endomembrane compartments including the _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ prevacuolar compartment _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and cell plate _PROTEIN_ . furthermore _LOCATION_ preparations were stained with neutral red and visually checked for purity using bright field microscopy . no obvious chloroplast contamination was observed by this analysis . in addition we performed analyses to detect other potential contaminants using immunoblotting and _METHOD_ microscopy . questions of purity and potential impacts of contaminants are discussed wherever appropriate below . to ensure a thorough coverage of the _LOCATION_ proteome complementary proteomic methodologies were explored . a schematic showing the methods used is shown in figure . the chosen methodologies ensure sensitive nonbiased data collection especially for low abundance extremely hydrophobic acidic or basic proteins . specifically a combination of multidimensional liquid chromatography/tandem _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and one dimensional _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ coupled with nano liquid chromatography/tandem _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was used on total _LOCATION_ preparations . also a separate tonoplast enriched fraction was analyzed by d _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ coupled with nano lc _METHOD_ . after separation by liquid chromatography a survey scan method was used to identify individual peptide precursor ions . peptides were then sequentially selected for collision induced dissociation analysis to generate fragment ion spectra . the resultant fragment ion patterns were analyzed using the mascot _METHOD_ ions search tool _PROTEIN_ . through these studies proteins were identified in the arabidopsis vegetative _LOCATION_ . the number of proteins identified by each of the methods is shown in figure . the _PROTEIN_ that many proteins were found exclusively by a particular method reinforced the need for multiple approaches for generating a comprehensive proteome list . the specific proteins identified by each method can be found in table and in supplemental table online . peptide scores for each of these proteins can also be found in supplemental table online . a total of of proteins were identified by a single peptide hit . however all such proteins were verified by manual inspection of the data . proteins were categorized into eight major groups of which six are presented in table . indicative of the methods used only out of glycosyl hydrolases were found in the thoroughly washed tonoplast fraction . these three hydrolases were also identified using the other methods . furthermore of identified transporter proteins _LOCATION_ were found in the tonoplast fraction . interestingly a recently published investigation of the arabidopsis tonoplast proteome identified a large number of glycosidases and proteases within their samples . however this may be because of a lack of thorough washing of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . a list of overlapping proteins found by our group citation and another independent tonoplast examination can be found in supplemental table online . functional categorization and characterization of identified _LOCATION_ proteins surprisingly _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ analysis of total _LOCATION_ proteins revealed that a single protein at kd represented the bulk of _LOCATION_ protein content . this protein was investigated separately using nano lc _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight analyses and was identified as a myrosinase associated protein . interestingly we also identified five additional map gene products and the corresponding myrosinase gene products . the reason that this protein accumulates to such high levels in the _LOCATION_ of mature arabidopsis leaves is unknown . however proteins that accumulate to such high levels in other _METHOD_ play roles in buffering changes in osmotic pressure such as serum albumin in animals . perhaps this map plays a role in controlling drastic osmotic fluctuations within the _LOCATION_ . it is also possible that the maps may be involved in modulating the enzyme activity of myrosinase . our results indicate that there was little contamination from other components of the endomembrane system however several _LOCATION_ and mitochondrial proteins were identified . for the analyses described below the proteins previously known to exist in mitochondria and chloroplasts have been excluded . these proteins were determined to be mitochondrial or _LOCATION_ based upon functional annotations and by searching the arabidopsis mitochondrial protein database and the _LOCATION_ proteome database . a list of these contaminant proteins can be found in supplemental table online . the location of identification of these proteins is also indicated _LOCATION_ in supplemental table online . out of potential contaminant proteins were found in whole _LOCATION_ in tonoplast samples and were found in both . whether or not these proteins represent true contamination remains to be evaluated . however immunoblotting was _PROTEIN_ performed to help determine the level of mitochondrial and chloroplastic contamination . supplemental figure online demonstrates that the mitochondrial _PROTEIN_ and chloroplast _PROTEIN_ specific markers used were not detected in our _LOCATION_ preparations . in addition to immunoblotting assays we analyzed purified _LOCATION_ samples for potential chloroplast contamination using _METHOD_ microscopy . in contrast with lysed protoplasts no _METHOD_ related to chloroplasts or their fragments was detected in purified _LOCATION_ samples . proteomic studies of mouse phagosomes _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ have demonstrated the presence of _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ mitochondrial cytoplasmic and _LOCATION_ proteins in these preparations . the finding of _LOCATION_ proteins in these organelles was _PROTEIN_ found to have great biological significance based upon the observation that the _LOCATION_ serves as a source of _LOCATION_ material for maturing phagosomes . furthermore proteins and even entire organelles are often targeted to the _LOCATION_ for degradation or autophagy processes . indeed via electron microscopy we routinely observe mitochondria and _LOCATION_ engulfed within _LOCATION_ of various tissues . proteomic studies on the plant _LOCATION_ may uncover proteins that at first appear to be contamination but in _PROTEIN_ result from degradation processes . all identified proteins were analyzed through multiple prediction _METHOD_ to provide theoretical subcellular localizations transmembrane domains molecular _METHOD_ and isoelectric points . to ensure a thorough analysis redundant methods were used for predictions of subcellular localization and transmembrane domains . the results of these prediction _METHOD_ are shown in table figure and in supplemental table online . the size and pi distribution of these proteins based upon predicted gene models is shown in figures and respectively . these analyses demonstrate that proteins with a wide range of sizes and isoelectric points were identified and that there are no observable gaps also indicating that there is little bias or information loss with the methods used . the predicted mean and median pi of all identified _LOCATION_ proteins are and respectively . these are more acidic than the mean and median pi for all predicted proteins of the arabidopsis genome _METHOD_ . also the average and median predicted molecular _METHOD_ of all arabidopsis proteins are and kd respectively versus the and kd of the identified _LOCATION_ proteins . thus the average predicted _METHOD_ of the identified _LOCATION_ proteins is slightly larger than that of the average arabidopsis protein . of course the mature _METHOD_ and isoelectric points of many of these proteins may be different than the predicted ones as a result of processing and degradation within the _LOCATION_ . targeting _METHOD_ predicted signal peptides _LOCATION_ in _PROTEIN_ and of the identified proteins with of these predicted by all three search _METHOD_ . overall proteins were predicted to have a signal peptide by at least one of these prediction _METHOD_ . transmembrane domains were also predicted using hmmtop tmhmm and thumbup and results from this analysis can be found in supplemental table online . the distribution of proteins with transmembrane domains predicted by hmmtop is shown in figure . after removal of all proteins with signal peptides another proteins were predicted to have at least one transmembrane domain by one or more prediction _METHOD_ . although the prediction _METHOD_ used are not perfect overall these results indicate that most proteins targeted to the _LOCATION_ are either delivered through the _LOCATION_ or are _LOCATION_ associated . of course there is the possibility that certain proteins containing signal peptides or transmembrane domains may be targeted to the _LOCATION_ via degradation or recycling processes . in addition many identified proteins not predicted to have signal peptides or transmembrane domains are known to be associated with integral _LOCATION_ proteins or other aspects of _LOCATION_ function including nine peripheral _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ subunits and three polyubiquitin proteins . some proteins previously shown to contain a functional ctpp include tobacco pr tobacco chitinase barley lectin and horseradish peroxidase . to date no endogenous arabidopsis proteins have been demonstrated to contain a functional ctpp . however the ctpp pathway was proven to be fully functional in arabidopsis plants as recombinant ctpp proteins from other plants species were properly targeted to the _LOCATION_ via dense vesicles . this leads us to the conclusion that there are endogenous arabidopsis proteins carrying functional ctpp sorting signals that have not yet been identified . in our study we identified arabidopsis pr three jacalin like lectins and six putative peroxidases in our samples . when the _LOCATION_ peroxidase sequences are aligned with all other arabidopsis peroxidases from the arabidopsis genome it becomes clear that the _LOCATION_ peroxidases contain a highly hydrophobic c terminal extension not found in other peroxidases . the aligned c terminal regions of the identified _LOCATION_ peroxidases with closely related arabidopsis genes and hrp are shown in figure . the functional ctpp of hrp is nearly identical to the c termini of the identified arabidopsis _LOCATION_ peroxidases and the cleavage site is also conserved . only three other peroxidases containing a similar c terminal extension are found in the arabidopsis genome . thus we have identified six out of nine peroxidases that likely contain ctpps . these peroxidases as well as the identified lectins and pr all contain hydrophobic c termini similar to known ctpp proteins and most likely represent native targets to study ctpp transport _METHOD_ in arabidopsis . our analyses of _LOCATION_ proteins only identified aleurain and a putative cys protease that contain the core canonical ntpp sequence npir . furthermore in arabidopsis only aleurain has been previously shown to be transported via the ntpp pathway . to identify other cargo potentially transported by the ntpp pathway proteins predicted to contain a signal peptide and two or fewer transmembrane domains were searched for divergent versions of the ntpp signal . this sequence was based upon other known sequence specific _LOCATION_ sorting signals _PROTEIN_ and determined to be . the results from this analysis can be found in the supplemental data online . this analysis identified proteins in this subset with potential ntpp signals . an alignment of nine of these putative ntpp containing proteins is shown in figure . these proteins all contain an ntpp variant immediately following the predicted signal peptide cleavage site . some _LOCATION_ proteins contain functional variants of the ntpp sequence in the middle or at the c terminus of the protein . thus the other identified proteins that contain an ntpp variant far downstream from the signal peptide cleavage site may also be localized to the _LOCATION_ by this sorting determinant . these proteins represent new native targets to study the ntpp pathway in arabidopsis . based upon the large number of predicted soluble proteins found in our samples and the small number of ntpp and ctpp containing proteins it is clear that alternative _METHOD_ to the ntpp and ctpp pathways likely exist for transporting proteins to the _LOCATION_ . as discussed previously it is now known that _LOCATION_ bodies represent a newly identified means of protein transport to the _LOCATION_ . some of these proteins contain putative _LOCATION_ retention signals _PROTEIN_ whereas others do not _LOCATION_ . indeed our samples identified nine proteins that contain potential _LOCATION_ retention signals . yet the means by which a number of the other identified proteins are transported to the _LOCATION_ are unknown . to address this finding several bioinformatics analyses were performed to identify other potential _LOCATION_ sorting determinants . the _METHOD_ gibbs motif sampler meme and block maker were used for identifying novel targeting motifs in the same protein set used for ntpp signal prediction . the results from these analyses can be found at http //bioinfo.ucr.edu/projects/vacuoleproteomics/overview.html . unfortunately under a wide range of parameter settings no obvious new patterns could be identified using these tools . as a parameter test the known _LOCATION_ retention signal kdel could be easily identified with all three _METHOD_ in a test protein set that contained different variants of this motif . to identify potential non sequence specific signals the physicochemical properties and hydrophobicity profiles of all proteins in this set were analyzed with several proteomics tools of the emboss package . the obtained _METHOD_ of these analyses can be accessed at the same web site . visual inspections of these plots did not reveal noticeable patterns of compositional properties in these proteins . these negative results indicate that many _LOCATION_ proteins may be targeted to the _LOCATION_ via more complex _METHOD_ than obvious sequence or amino acid distribution patterns . the _LOCATION_ is a major component of the plant endomembrane system and the correct targeting of vesicles and their cargo is the primary basis for the compartmentalization and identity of the _LOCATION_ . the primary control of _LOCATION_ fusion in eukaryotes is mediated by soluble n ethylmaleimide sensitive _PROTEIN_ attachment protein receptor proteins . data on snare localization to the tonoplast has been accompanied with some level of controversy . in previous observations _PROTEIN_ was found on the tonoplast of meristematic cells however other studies have suggested that _PROTEIN_ might be localized exclusively to the prevacuolar compartment . recently we identified a protein complex directly interacting with _PROTEIN_ that is localized to the tonoplast providing indirect evidence of _PROTEIN_ tonoplast localization . here we present additional evidence that the qa snare _PROTEIN_ is localized to the tonoplast along with four other snare proteins . tonoplast localization of _PROTEIN_ was also detected by citation however the protein was misannotated as an _PROTEIN_ mitochondrial protein . two proteins qc snares _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ may have redundant functions . a third identified protein is _PROTEIN_ a qb snare that likely acts as a v snare for the _PROTEIN_ t snare complex . _PROTEIN_ and were previously identified as interacting partners of _PROTEIN_ based on immunoprecipitation and colocalization experiments . a fourth identified snare protein is _PROTEIN_ an r snare from the longin family . the closely related _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were previously identified in a tonoplast derived sample and based on protein similarity _PROTEIN_ may also have redundant functions . interestingly these four snare proteins were the only snares identified in our tonoplast sample . from our data all four groups of snare proteins necessary for _LOCATION_ fusion are represented and these findings are unprecedented among recently published data . importantly the snare proteins were entirely absent in proteomics data presented by citation and only two groups of snare proteins were identified by citation . the identification of all four groups of snare proteins within our highly enriched tonoplast fraction suggests that we have identified a snare pin complex responsible for _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ fusion at the tonoplast . we also identified several proteins that likely interact with the proposed snare pin complex including _PROTEIN_ binding proteins _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ which are homologous to yeast _PROTEIN_ and two proteins which are homologous to yeast and snap . these yeast homologs are known to be involved in _LOCATION_ fusion at the tonoplast . here we present experimental evidence that these proteins currently annotated based on in silico analyses are likely to be orthologous to their yeast counterparts . localization of together with the _PROTEIN_ complex to the tonoplast suggests its predicted role as an r snare in a snare pin formation and represents a unique application of a proteomics approach . given the presence of redundancy in the longin gene family identification of the fourth snare protein in the snare pin complex using traditional biochemical or genetic methods would likely require analysis of plants carrying multiple mutations . considering the embryo or gametophyte lethality of mutants in genes encoding snares or snare associated proteins genetic approaches may not always elucidate snare protein function . therefore a proteomics approach proves to be an appropriate method to test these hypotheses . of the predicted protein coding genes in arabidopsis have been classified into functional categories based on homology . approximately of all arabidopsis proteins including many plant specific proteins have no predicted function . thus the functions of a substantial proportion of the arabidopsis genome remain elusive . of the proteins we identified were annotated as either _PROTEIN_ or hypothetical proteins . of these proteins were predicted to have a signal peptide and another have one or more predicted transmembrane domains . thus a large percentage of these proteins are likely directly associated with the endomembrane system . these proteins were also examined for conserved domains using blast searches to provide clues to their activities . these analyses did not identify conserved domains associated with known activities however the identification of these proteins in the plant _LOCATION_ may aid future research in understanding their respective functions . much can be inferred into _LOCATION_ function and biogenesis based upon the proteins identified . all proteins were classified into various categories based upon the annotations and gene ontology categorizations from tair . we classified all proteins into the eight major categories shown in figure . the identities of the proteins in six of these categories are also shown in table . these categories include _LOCATION_ remodeling and fusion/protein trafficking transporters biotic and abiotic stress response protein degradation glycosidases _LOCATION_ miscellaneous and _PROTEIN_ proteins . many proteins identified in the individual groups represent new findings . aside from the proteins directly involved in _LOCATION_ fusion discussed above _PROTEIN_ a large number of enzymes with the capability to affect tonoplast physicochemical properties were discovered . the largest group of these proteins includes nine putative lipases . the products of phospholipase activity play key roles in signal transduction cytoskeletal structure the respiratory burst and endomembrane trafficking in animals . similar findings are occurring for plant species . phosphatidic acid derived from phosholipase d activity is required for tobacco pollen tube growth and is suggested to play a role in the regulation of _LOCATION_ trafficking in the secretory pathway . furthermore a putative phospholipase _PROTEIN_ is required for shoot gravitropism in arabidopsis a process that is highly _LOCATION_ trafficking dependent . it is hypothesized that _PROTEIN_ activity may alter _LOCATION_ structure or produce signaling lipids . thus besides serving degradative purposes in the _LOCATION_ the lipases found within our samples may be involved in similar processes as those discussed above . a major function of the plant _LOCATION_ is protein processing and degradation . the large central _LOCATION_ of plants are often thought of as being analogous to the yeast _LOCATION_ or animal lysosome . in yeast _LOCATION_ proteases are synthesized as precursors undergoing many posttranslational modifications before a final active protein is formed . this process is regulated by a tightly controlled proteolytic cascade . many studies have indicated that a similar system occurs in plants . for example t dna knockout mutants of the _LOCATION_ processing enzyme family do not degrade and improperly process various proteins . in this study potential proteases were identified of which only three were previously known to reside in the arabidopsis _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . these proteins represent asp cys and ser type proteases . only eight proteases from our data set were also reported by citation including four ser proteases two cys proteases _PROTEIN_ and two asp proteases . the functions of these proteases in protein degradation in the _LOCATION_ can now be efficiently studied by reverse genetics approaches . furthermore the identification of these various proteases now allows us to decipher the hierarchy of the putative proteolytic cascade in plant _LOCATION_ . another major function of the plant _LOCATION_ is _PROTEIN_ of turgor pressure and storage of metabolites and ions . forty six different gene products involved in transport were identified . the major transporter group consisted of subunits of the v _PROTEIN_ . the central _LOCATION_ is _PROTEIN_ at a ph of . this acidic environment is produced through the activity of a v _PROTEIN_ and is required for providing energy for the transport of ions and organic metabolites . it has also been suggested that the proton gradient is required for protein sorting and _LOCATION_ fusion events . the arabidopsis v _PROTEIN_ contains distinct functional subunits encoded by genes . because of the extensive gene duplication and corresponding protein sequence identities we analyzed our data in respect to the protein function as a distinct subunit rather than to the number of particular gene products . recently a proteomic examination of the _LOCATION_ tonoplast identified seven functional subunits of the v _PROTEIN_ and an independent study by citation reported functional subunits . in this study we identified all but a single subunit vha e of the functional plant v _PROTEIN_ . the nonidentified protein is predicted to be kd in size which may explain why it was not identified . this subunit was not identified in either this study or by citation . overall the identification of of the v _PROTEIN_ subunits indicates the depth of coverage of the _LOCATION_ proteome reported here . many other proteins involved in ion and metabolite transport across the tonoplast were identified . in total we report transporters or transport related proteins other than the subunits of a v _PROTEIN_ . notable among these proteins are several calcium sugar and abc transporters . remarkably three of these proteins were also identified in both independent studies by citation and citation including _PROTEIN_ subunit of v type h _PROTEIN_ and abc transporters _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . many identified proteins are members of large gene families of which we have identified a subset that are presumably localized to the tonoplast . glycosyl hydrolases are involved in many processing events in plants ranging from general metabolism to defense . a total of potential glycosyl hydrolase gene products were identified in the vegetative _LOCATION_ . these glycosidases represent a wide array of predicted activities including fructofuranosidase _PROTEIN_ l fucosidase galactosidase mannosidase d _PROTEIN_ exohydrolase hexosaminidase galactosidase/melibiase _PROTEIN_ endo _PROTEIN_ polygalacturonase xylosidase and _PROTEIN_ . only six of these proteins were reported by citation and none by citation . thus the protein data presented here form a successful attempt to comprehensively describe a subset of lumenal _LOCATION_ proteins . interestingly three identified _PROTEIN_ contain _LOCATION_ retention signals at their respective c termini . an _LOCATION_ retention signal was recently suggested to be responsible for the _LOCATION_ localization of one of these _PROTEIN_ . thus we have identified two more examples of _LOCATION_ retention signals that may function in _LOCATION_ targeting of proteins under certain conditions . another major function of plant _LOCATION_ includes stress and defense responses . defense related proteins previously shown to localize to the _LOCATION_ from various species include proteinase inhibitors chitinases peroxidases osmotin glycosidases berberine bridge enzyme strictosidine synthase and lectins . we also found a large number of the above defense related proteins to be localized to the central _LOCATION_ . we identified six putative peroxidases three jacalin like lectins two strictosidine synthase like proteins pr and a putative cys protease inhibitor . interestingly three proteins from a prohibitin family were also identified by citation . moreover many of the glycosidases and proteases discussed above are also likely involved in direct defense or stress responses . all organelles share intimate contacts with the _LOCATION_ . the direct involvement of the _LOCATION_ and the _LOCATION_ in the gravitropic response has also been recently documented . a small number of proteins potentially involved in anchoring the _LOCATION_ to the _LOCATION_ were identified . these include members of the actin myosin microtubule associated protein and fimbrin families . we also identified three members of the dynamin protein family . mammalian dynamins are known to be associated with actin suggesting their plant counterparts may be involved in _LOCATION_ related processes at the tonoplast . interestingly one of two possible dynamins _GENE_ or _GENE_ has been suggested to play a role in the transport of cargo proteins from the trans _LOCATION_ network to the _LOCATION_ . at total of proteins do not fall into the large easily categorized groups discussed above . a large number of these proteins are primarily associated with the _LOCATION_ including and ribosomal proteins lumenal binding protein calcineurin calnexin calreticulin and calmodulin . at first look these proteins may appear to be contamination . however the presence of these proteins in the _LOCATION_ can easily be explained . for example dense vesicles coated with ribosomes _LOCATION_ have been shown to bud directly from the rough _LOCATION_ and fuse directly with _LOCATION_ tonoplast . the finding of ribosomal proteins exclusively in the tonoplast fraction exemplifies this _PROTEIN_ . in contrast with citation where the tonoplast sample was derived from arabidopsis suspension cells we isolated _LOCATION_ from mature arabidopsis leaves . it is not surprising that the data set from the suspension cell derived tonoplast sample did not contain many ribosomal proteins as _LOCATION_ bodies are _PROTEIN_ associated with vegetative tissues . furthermore as discussed previously _LOCATION_ retention signals can act as efficient _LOCATION_ sorting signals and promote _LOCATION_ targeting of proteins that escape the _LOCATION_ . consistent with this observation the stress resulting from the generation of protoplasts may induce the overproduction of the _LOCATION_ resident proteins potentially resulting in their _LOCATION_ delivery and identification in our samples . in this study we purified _LOCATION_ away from other cellular compartments and provide a thorough coverage of the arabidopsis vegetative _LOCATION_ proteome . this is an essential step for _METHOD_ biology approaches in general and in particular toward understanding the function of this dynamic organelle . although the _LOCATION_ has been extensively studied the molecular bases for its many physiological roles remain largely unknown . these results present testable hypotheses for determining the molecular components of many processes including tonoplast fusion _LOCATION_ biogenesis _LOCATION_ sorting determinants cytoskeletal attachments and protein degradation . this study also sets a baseline that may be used to compare the protein profiles of the _LOCATION_ from wild type and mutant or specifically treated plants .
wild type arabidopsis thaliana ecotype columbia was grown in soil at with a cycle of h h dark . reagents and chemicals were obtained from fisher scientific _PROTEIN_ or from sigma unless otherwise noted . _LOCATION_ were purified from healthy green rosette leaves from d old plants . briefly g of leaf tissue were cut into thin slices with a razor blade and incubated for h at in protoplasting solution containing g of macerozyme r g of cellulase onozuka r and g of dissolved in ml of wash buffer . protoplasts were recovered by filtering the protoplasts away from undissolved tissue followed by centrifugation for min at rpm in a beckman gs centrifuge . protoplasts were washed two times in wash buffer and then lysed in a solution containing m mannitol ficoll mm edta and mm ph . density ultracentrifugation was then performed as previously described except that bsa was omitted from all solutions . this method results in the layering of enriched _LOCATION_ and allows for the efficient separation of central _LOCATION_ from other endomembrane compartments . yields were approximately of protein per preparation . to ensure thorough protein coverage two separate methods were used for total _LOCATION_ proteome analyses . one methodology involved trypsin digestion of protein in liquid followed by multidimensional lc _METHOD_ . these samples were processed as previously described . for the second method _LOCATION_ preparations were concentrated with a millipore molecular weight cutoff centrifugal concentrator and total protein concentration was determined . two hundred and fifty _METHOD_ of total protein was subjected to standard cm _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . the resulting gel was briefly stained with _METHOD_ brilliant blue r and cut into thin horizontal slices . gel slices were then digested with trypsin and processed essentially as described previously . the in gel digest of individual gel bands was analyzed by a nano electron spray ionization _METHOD_ using a _METHOD_ q tof api us instrument . the atlantis column was used for lc peptide separation . a internal diameter mm long guard column was placed at the front of the analytical column to preconcentrate the tryptic peptides through a port switch valve connection . the pickup sample loading method was configured with a sample loop in the autosampler for maximal loading with zero sample loss . samples were loaded and desalted for min using formic acid with a flow rate of . the solvent components for peptide elution were as follows mobile phase a was formic acid and acetonitrile and mobile phase b was formic acid and acetonitrile . the duration of the complete lc method was for min as follows to min b at min b at min b at min b at to min b at to min b . a h blank washing method was introduced between each sample . a manually configured flow splitter was used to apply flow rate to the guard and analytical column which was connected with a internal diameter picotip nanospray emitter . the _METHOD_ instrument parameters were tuned to achieve the highest sensitivity and resolution as possible . for tonoplast isolation _LOCATION_ preparations were centrifuged at for h and the supernatant was removed . _LOCATION_ fractions were then washed in _PROTEIN_ and recentrifuged three times . protein from the resultant _LOCATION_ preparation was quantified by the method of citation . two hundred _METHOD_ of protein was boiled in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ buffer and subjected to a standard cm _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . the gel was stained briefly in _METHOD_ brilliant blue r and processed using the second method described above . for protein identification the internet based mascot _METHOD_ ions search tool _PROTEIN_ was used to manually search against the national center for biotechnology information nonredundant database . search parameters were set as follows taxonomy arabidopsis enzyme trypsin variable modifications acetyl oxidation phospho _PROTEIN_ phospho pyro glu pyro glu _METHOD_ values monoisotopic protein _METHOD_ unrestricted peptide _METHOD_ tolerance ppm fragment _METHOD_ tolerance d max missed cleavages . the parameters used for positive protein identification were essentially identical to those previously described . proteins with a minimum of one peptide match and containing a sequence tag with at least three amino acids in a row in either y or b ion series but not matching to any other proteins were considered as positive and listed in the final summary . all proteins with only a single peptide match were verified by manual inspection of y and b ion series to identify the minimal sequence tag of three consecutive ions . also eight proteins with a single peptide match but without a three amino acid sequence tag were also included after individual investigation . each of these proteins had multiple numbers of two amino acid sequence tags significant mascot scores and no secondary hits . for matches representing protein families only one member is presented . all proteins identified through the ncbi database were verified by blast searches against the tair database . all identified proteins were run through a series of prediction _METHOD_ to provide theoretical subcellular localizations molecular _METHOD_ transmembrane domains and isoelectric points . subcellular localizations were predicted by three _METHOD_ including ipsort _PROTEIN_ and targetp . transmembrane domains were predicted by the three _METHOD_ hmmtop tmhmm and thumbup . protein _METHOD_ and isoelectric points were determined with the tair bulk protein search tool . physicochemical properties hydrophobicity profiles protein _METHOD_ and isoelectric points were determined with the bulk protein search tool from tair and the emboss package . motif finding of known patterns was performed with regular _PROTEIN_ in perl . for pattern discovery of unknown motifs we used gibbs motif sampler meme and block maker . the data set of proteins used for ntpp prediction was derived from proteins predicted to contain a signal peptide and two or fewer transmembrane domains . note that transmembrane domain prediction _METHOD_ usually identify signal peptides as tmds thus accounting for one of the allowed tmds in this protein set . furthermore to address the possibility of _LOCATION_ tmd predictions we allowed a second tmd in the proteins included in this list . this protein set was scanned with regular _PROTEIN_ searches for the presence of two related motifs . searches were performed with pattern and pattern . the pattern discovery _METHOD_ gibbs motif sampler meme and block maker were used for identifying potentially new targeting motifs in the same protein set . overall sequence similarity between sequences and biased amino compositions can generate false positive patterns using these _METHOD_ . therefore related sequences with > sequence identity were removed with the blastclust software and low complexity regions were masked with the cast program . the removal of related sequences resulted in a subset of protein sequences that were used for motif discovery . more detailed results can be viewed at http
