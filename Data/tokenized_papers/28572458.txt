to understand the biogenesis of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ in higher plants and to identify auxiliary proteins required to build up this highly complex _LOCATION_ system we have characterized the allelic _LOCATION_ mutants high chlorophyll _METHOD_ and and isolated the causal gene by map based cloning . in the ethyl methanesulfonate induced mutant the accumulation of the cytochrome complex was reduced to compared with the wild type . other _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ complexes accumulated to normal levels . the t dna knockout mutant showed a more severe defect with respect to _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ proteins and accumulated only of the complex accompanied by a reduction in photosystem ii the photosystem ii light harvesting complex and photosystem i. encodes a protein of amino acids in arabidopsis that has similarities to the cysteine rich zinc binding domain of dnaj chaperones . the insulin precipitation assay demonstrated that has disulfide reductase activity in vitro . the protein is conserved in higher plants and bryophytes but absent in algae and cyanobacteria . confocal _METHOD_ microscopy showed that a fraction of green _METHOD_ protein was detectable in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ but that it also could be recognized in chloroplasts . a fusion construct of containing a _LOCATION_ transit peptide targets the protein into chloroplasts and was able to complement the mutational defect . these findings indicate that the chloroplast targeted is indispensable for the maturation and/or assembly of the complex and is very likely involved in thiol disulfide biochemistry at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ .
in an _METHOD_ mutagenized population of arabidopsis we screened for mutants with an hcf phenotype . this phenotype is indicative for reduced photosynthetic performance of plants and can be the result of impaired _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ biogenesis in chloroplasts . in this screen the mutant was selected . imaging of chlorophyll a _METHOD_ with a fluorcam system showed significantly increased steady state _METHOD_ of seedlings compared with the wild type . on suc supplemented medium mutant growth was retarded slightly and leaves were paler than in the wild type . in contrast under autotrophic conditions on suc free substrate mutant seedlings showed severe growth retardation and leaves were much paler than in the wild type . after weeks seedlings only developed two tiny rosette leaves compared with four to six leaves in the wild type . during cultivation on soil mutant seedlings died after to weeks thus seeds can only be obtained from heterozygous plants . for all experiments the progeny of heterozygous mutants were grown on suc supplemented medium and mutants were selected by their hcf phenotype . in order to examine the photosynthetic capacity of the mutant more closely we measured chlorophyll _METHOD_ induction kinetics with week old intact plants . the maximum quantum efficiency of psii photochemistry was comparable to that of the wild type in indicating efficient psii photochemistry . in contrast _METHOD_ quenching in continuous actinic light was reduced drastically in the mutant and the parameter ql which reflects the fraction of oxidized qa in psii reaction centers in continuous light reached only of the wild type value in . this behavior can be attributed to impaired electron transport capacities behind psii either due to defects in the complex or psi or even both . mean values for at least three plants are shown . whole seedlings were measured with the following light intensities _METHOD_ saturating light pulses and min of actinic light . fv/fm maximum quantum yield of psii effective quantum yield of psii ql fraction of open psii centers npq nonphotochemical quenching . student s t test significance levels are as follows p < p < and p < . to differentiate between these alternatives we studied the redox activity of the psi reaction center by measuring the absorbance kinetics of at to nm . in wild type plants was reduced in the dark and became completely oxidized under illumination with far red light reflected by an increased absorbance . a similar absorbance increase was observed for suggesting the integrity of psi reaction centers . a saturating light pulse was able to reduce in the wild type and in . however in continuous actinic light was completely oxidized in the mutant whereas the redox state of wild type equilibrates to a steady state level corresponding to a partly oxidized state . this behavior indicated the disruption of electron transport between psii and psi thus pointing to a defect in the complex . to confirm that the observed phenotype of is caused by a single _LOCATION_ mutation we analyzed the segregation ratio of hcf mutants and the wild type in the progeny of heterozygous plants . in a representative analysis with individuals we found the expected mendelian ratio indicating a recessive monogenic _LOCATION_ mutation . segregation of the hcf mutant phenotype was determined on suc supplemented medium . segregation of antibiotic resistance was examined separately on sulfadiazine containing medium . numbers represent individual seedlings determined and the percentage is given in parentheses . _PROTEIN_ backcrossed t dna mutant . in order to map the gene heterozygous mutants were crossed to the ecotype landsberg _LOCATION_ and a mapping population of homozygous mutant plants was genotyped using simple sequence length _METHOD_ and cleaved amplified polymorphic sequences as genetic markers . the mutated gene was mapped to a kb fragment on the upper arm of chromosome . of the remaining genes in this chromosomal region all were amplified in the mutant background and sequenced . comparison of mutant and wild type genomic sequences revealed a c to t transition in the first exon of the gene _GENE_ leading to an amino acid exchange from ala to val in the mutant allele . the importance of the identified gene _GENE_ for growth and photosynthesis of arabidopsis seedlings was further examined using the t dna insertion line _PROTEIN_ from the gabi kat collection which possesses an insertion in the intron of _GENE_ between nucleotides and . as more than one t dna insertion was assumed for this mutant a backcross with the wild type was performed to obtain a progeny containing a single insertion . heterozygous plants from this backcrossed line _PROTEIN_ segregated pale green hcf mutants according to the typical mendelian ratio revealing that the mutant phenotype results from inactivation of a single recessive _LOCATION_ gene . a proportion of sulfadiazine sensitive seedlings in the generation showed that only one t dna insertion exists in the mutant genome . in the progeny of the backcrossed t dna line we found mutants with a more severe phenotype than that of the _METHOD_ mutant . under heterotrophic growth conditions mutants stayed very tiny and their leaves bleached much stronger than observed for mutants . on suc free medium seedlings appeared transparent and grew even slower . due to the minimal chlorophyll content of the mutant the steady state _METHOD_ of leaves was increased only slightly compared with the wild type . recording of _METHOD_ induction kinetics revealed a reduced maximum quantum efficiency of psii photochemistry by . furthermore there was more or less no _METHOD_ quenching in the light thus ql tends to . the absorbance resembled that of however a saturating light pulse in the far red background was unable to reduce the reaction center of psi . altogether these results indicate a severe defect in the complex as well as impaired psii photochemistry in the t dna mutant . to verify that the identified gene is responsible for the phenotypic alterations in the two mutants and _PROTEIN_ we introduced the wild type cdna of _GENE_ into heterozygous plants by agrobacterium tumefaciens mediated transformation . to this end we used the gateway based vector which confers a promoter and the coding region for a c terminal amino acid long triple hemagglutinin epitope tag to the cdna . in the progeny of transformed heterozygous plants from both mutants we were able to identify seedlings that were homozygous for the locus or the _PROTEIN_ t dna insertion but that grew like the wild type under autotrophic conditions . measurement of chlorophyll a _METHOD_ revealed wild type kinetics for the transformed lines ha and ha consequently the complemented phenotypes confirmed the identity of the gene as the causal mutant gene in and and revealed that the _GENE_ cdna encodes a functional protein . to examine the _PROTEIN_ level of _GENE_ in the two mutants real time pcr was used to quantify the corresponding mrna levels . in the _METHOD_ mutant the corresponding transcript reached the wild type level whereas the t dna line lacked this mrna . this demonstrates that the inserted t dna leads to a knockout of the gene _GENE_ corresponding to the more severe phenotype of this mutant allele . to address the question of whether the defect in photosynthetic electron transport of the mutants is based on reduced accumulation of _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ protein complexes levels of the major plastome and _LOCATION_ encoded components of psii the complex psi and the _PROTEIN_ synthase were determined by immunoblot analyses . in both mutants the most pronounced reduction was found for the levels of all four large subunits . however the mutants differed in the degree of protein reduction . whereas the _METHOD_ mutant accumulated around of the plastome encoded cytochrome f cytochrome and _PROTEIN_ as well as _LOCATION_ encoded rieske protein these subunits were around or even below the level in the t dna mutant . subunits of the core complex of psii _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and psi _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ reached wild type levels in but only ranged between and in the t dna line . notably _LOCATION_ encoded subunits of the oxygen evolving complex of psii also showed diminished levels in the mutant _PROTEIN_ . ponceau red staining of separated _LOCATION_ proteins revealed a significant reduction of the lhcb complex in . a specific antibody against _PROTEIN_ detected wild type amounts of this protein in but only about was detected in . the subunit of _PROTEIN_ synthase reached wild type amounts or even somewhat higher levels in both mutants . the observed reduction of nearly all tested photosynthetic proteins in might be the consequence of a generally impaired protein synthesis rate in chloroplasts of this mutant . besides _LOCATION_ proteins also soluble _LOCATION_ proteins should be affected by this defect . thus we measured the amount of the large subunit of rubisco as a soluble representative in whole cell extracts of the wild type and mutants . normal accumulation of this abundant protein demonstrated that the reduction of the different _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ proteins in is not the consequence of a generally _PROTEIN_ synthesis rate of _LOCATION_ proteins . similar amounts of protein also were detected for the rubisco small subunit in the wild type and mutants . due to the strong deficiencies for the complex in secondary effects based on damage through applied growth light can not be excluded . to examine the extent of this effect mutant seedlings were cultivated under dimmed light with the intensity of to . in order to get a more accurate quantitation of _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ proteins in the t dna mutant selected proteins were determined by immunoblot analyses of whole cell proteins from both mutants . the obtained data showed that _LOCATION_ proteins of psii psi the complex and the lhcb complex are still reduced significantly in however some of these proteins accumulate to slightly higher levels _PROTEIN_ under dimmed light . the most severe reduction was again observed for the large subunits of the complex which accumulated to around . this indicated only minimal protein damage through applied light thus reduced protein levels of are primarily the result of the mutation . in addition this experiment showed that quantification of the protein levels in is comparable in _LOCATION_ and whole cell protein fractions . besides the integral _LOCATION_ proteins and lumen exposed peripheral _LOCATION_ proteins we also tested the accumulation of fnr which is exposed to the stroma . like the subunit of the _PROTEIN_ synthase fnr accumulated to wild type levels in both mutants indicating that the protein is unaffected by the strong reduction of the complex . taken together our results imply that the phenotype of the mutant is attributable primarily to equally reduced steady state levels of the large subunits of the complex . in the knockout mutant levels of subunits were much more strongly reduced moreover the accumulation of psii lhcb and psi subunits was also significantly impaired . to address the question of whether the reduced protein levels are caused by reduced mrna amounts rna gel blot hybridization using probes against transcripts of the large proteins was performed with whole leaf mrna from . compared with the wild type we found no reduction or modified processing pattern for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mrnas in the mutant . for the t dna mutant we analyzed levels of several _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ encoded mrnas of _LOCATION_ proteins by quantitative real time pcr . for the transcripts _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ differences between the wild type and were within the normal fluctuation range . the same was observed for transcripts of psi proteins _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ the subunit of the _PROTEIN_ synthase _PROTEIN_ and the _PROTEIN_ mrna . the three psii transcripts tested _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were reduced slightly ranging from to of the wild type levels . the amounts of the related proteins were around thus it can be assumed that mrna levels are not limiting for the synthesis of the corresponding proteins . as rnas for the large subunits accumulate normally reduced protein levels might be the consequence of reduced translation . thus we fractionated ribosome bound leaf rna of the wild type and mutants on suc density gradients to analyze ribosomal loading of _LOCATION_ encoded rnas for subunits . in both mutants gel blot hybridization with gene specific probes revealed a distribution pattern for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ petn and the _LOCATION_ encoded _PROTEIN_ rna that resembles the distribution in the wild type . thus we conclude that the low amounts of proteins in the two allelic mutants are not due to reduced mrna levels or to reduced translational efficiency but are very likely a failure of a specific posttranslational modification that in turn leads to increased degradation of the affected proteins . the stability of proteins is determined among other _PROTEIN_ by the correct association of their nonproteinaceous cofactors . therefore we examined covalently attached hemes in cytochrome f and by the peroxidation of luminol which results in chemiluminescence emission . in several heme attachment mutants of c. reinhardtii and arabidopsis heme was undetectable but apocytochromes accumulated to low amounts . in addition the migration of apocytochrome is increased slightly compared with the holoform leading to a band shift in heme cn binding mutants . analysis of peroxidase activity in protein extracts of revealed that the heme amount in cytochrome f corresponded to the level of the accumulating protein indicating that remaining protein amounts represent holocytochrome f . in anti cytochrome f detected no protein band hence protein levels were significantly below . in contrast heme staining revealed about heme . a closer look showed that the detected band was shifted slightly downward in all our heme staining experiments . therefore it is unlikely that this band represents holocytochrome f. it is possible that this is mitochondrial cytochrome whose size is very similar to that of cytochrome f and that might be up regulated in the mutant . for cytochrome of heme and protein levels reached around . in the mutant heme cn was below the detection limit and cytochrome protein levels were around . although a direct comparison of heme and protein levels was not feasible for this mutant a shift of the protein band as can be expected for accumulating apocytochrome was not visible . taken together these results indicate that covalent heme attachment to cytochrome f and cytochrome was not impaired in mutants . the reading frame of encodes a small protein of amino acids that is characterized by eight conserved cys residues arranged in two clusters . the two cys clusters show homology with the zinc finger domain of e. coli chaperone dnaj proteins . in this motif two zinc _METHOD_ are coordinated between the cys residues of four cxxc motifs forming a loop structure . in dnaj proteins the sequence cxxc is often followed by two conserved gly residues . in only in one of the four cxxc motifs conserved gly residues were found . besides the cys rich zinc finger motif contains no further known domains . phylogenetic analysis showed orthologs of in land plants but no related proteins were found in algae or cyanobacteria or in other taxa . the ortholog of from populus trichocarpa was assigned to a protein family designated as glutaredoxin like proteins . the designation glutaredoxin like is merely based upon the existence of the cxxc motifs but no other similarities . in arabidopsis the protein family contains members . the alignment of the amino acid sequence of arabidopsis with sequences from dicots monocots the primitive angiosperm amborella trichopoda and the liverwort marchantia polymorpha revealed conservation for the regions comprising the cxxc motifs . the highest similarity of around to was found between the n terminal half of and its orthologs . based on targeting predictions summarized in the _PROTEIN_ database of arabidopsis proteins the n terminus of was identified to contain a signal peptide that directs the protein into the secretory pathway . the targetp program predicts the possible cleavage site between amino acids and . the predicted cellular targets of the protein were inconsistent varying between _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and the _LOCATION_ space and also _LOCATION_ localization was suggested although with low confidence . to examine the localization of in the cell we analyzed the transient _PROTEIN_ of fused with _METHOD_ in nicotiana benthamiana mesophyll cells . the full length cdna of was cloned into the gateway destination vector which provided a promoter and a c terminal _METHOD_ . after infiltration of n. benthamiana leaves with transformed agrobacterium tumefaciens protoplasts were isolated and analyzed by confocal laser scanning microscopy . transient _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ for h resulted in a _METHOD_ signal that labeled a net like structure throughout the whole mesophyll protoplast . the pattern of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ suggested that the fusion protein is partly located to the _LOCATION_ . thus we used the _LOCATION_ marker protein _LOCATION_ mcherry _LOCATION_ to label this cell compartment . figure shows a clear overlap between _LOCATION_ mcherry and _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . in addition to the _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ also was detectable in chloroplasts however this _METHOD_ had a lower intensity but was visible in each chloroplast . to verify that the detected _METHOD_ in chloroplasts was caused by _METHOD_ alone and not overlaid by chlorophyll _METHOD_ we recorded the _METHOD_ of wild type protoplasts under the same microscope settings as for _METHOD_ detection . wild type protoplasts showed no _METHOD_ emission in the _METHOD_ channel confirming that the signal in chloroplasts of transformed leaves is caused by _METHOD_ . to present a more quantitative picture of the detected _METHOD_ _METHOD_ we generated a _METHOD_ profile of figure reflecting signals in the _LOCATION_ and a chloroplast . the _METHOD_ profile of the first revealed a peak of the mcherry profile because the profile line passes through the _LOCATION_ . inside the chloroplast reflected by increased chlorophyll _METHOD_ mcherry _METHOD_ declined sharply to the basic level . the _METHOD_ profile line also declined but only to an intermediate level which is significantly above the basic level and which arises from the _METHOD_ located inside the chloroplast . in contrast to the fusion protein _METHOD_ without a target peptide showed _METHOD_ in the _LOCATION_ and no _METHOD_ signals inside the chloroplasts . accordingly the profile of _METHOD_ declined to a low level inside this cell compartment . to confirm the localization of we repeated our studies with protoplasts from mutants that stably _PROTEIN_ the _METHOD_ fusion protein . the mutant phenotype of these transformed plants was restored because all photosynthetic parameters were comparable to the wild type _METHOD_ . this indicates that _METHOD_ is functional and targeted correctly . _METHOD_ _METHOD_ in protoplasts from these lines resembled the distribution found in n. benthamiana protoplasts . in each chloroplast _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was detectable and partly net like structures were visible in the _LOCATION_ . the _METHOD_ profile revealed a perfect correspondence between _METHOD_ and chlorophyll _METHOD_ on the left side of the selected chloroplast whereas the _METHOD_ profile increased at the right margin flanked by the _LOCATION_ . for comparison we analyzed protoplasts from an arabidopsis _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ marker line _LOCATION_ gk which showed the typical interconnected _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ network but no _METHOD_ in the chloroplast compartment . altogether our analysis revealed that is dually located to the _LOCATION_ and the chloroplast . under the conditions we examined in n. benthamiana and arabidopsis only a minor fraction of the fusion protein is located to chloroplasts . the observed import into the _LOCATION_ compartment corresponds to the predicted n terminal signal peptide of amino acids in . as is dually targeted the question arises of which of the two locations is relevant for the observed mutational lesion . to be able to define the role of the chloroplast located we stably transformed the mutant with a full length fusion protein that was provided with the chloroplast transit peptide of the rbcs protein . this protein version should be able to restore the functional lesion in the chloroplast . we selected nine independent transformants that had a homozygous mutant background and were able to grow under photoautotrophic conditions . analyses of chlorophyll _METHOD_ kinetics showed wild type behavior for these transformed plants with respect to all _METHOD_ parameters tested _METHOD_ . detection of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ in leaf protoplasts confirmed the localization of the fusion protein ctp _METHOD_ inside chloroplasts . no further _METHOD_ signals outside the organelles could be visualized . the successful complementation strongly suggests that chloroplast targeting of is sufficient to restore the mutational lesion indicating that is acting in this cell compartment during _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ biogenesis . however we can not exclude that spurious amounts of enter the _LOCATION_ or remain in the _LOCATION_ and contribute to complementation of the mutant phenotype . to obtain more information about we isolated protein extracts from week old seedlings and detected ha using an antibody against the c terminal epitope tag . the immunoblot revealed a protein band around kd exclusively in whole cell protein extracts of the complemented line ha and not in the wild type indicating the specificity of the antibody to ha . the segregation distance of the protein correlates roughly with the size of the full length protein plus kd for the triple ha tag . the nature of a faint band migrating below this major signal could be the result of a partial loss of the ha tag as found for ha tagged _PROTEIN_ protein in a stably transformed arabidopsis mutant . when whole cell proteins were separated into _LOCATION_ and soluble proteins was found in the whole cell _LOCATION_ fraction and no fusion protein was detectable in the soluble fraction . we then tried to detect ha in intact chloroplasts isolated from to week old seedlings and separated on a percoll gradient but immunodetection with the anti ha antibody gave no reproducible results because protein levels were at or below the detection limit . to get a first insight into the _LOCATION_ binding capacity of we isolated whole cell _LOCATION_ extracts from week old seedlings and treated the _LOCATION_ with different salts and detergent . removal of ha from the _LOCATION_ could only be achieved by detergent treatment whereas sodium bromide had no effect and sodium thiocyanate extracted minor amounts of the protein . this suggests that contains at least one hydrophobic helix which anchors the protein in the _LOCATION_ . the only hydrophobic stretch of the protein is located in the n terminus as part of the signal peptide . the program toppred predicted this helix from amino acids to as a certain transmembrane helix . consists almost entirely of the zinc finger domain of dnaj proteins as found for the chloroplast proteins _PROTEIN_ and . based on this cys rich motif thiol disulfide oxidoreductase activity was measured for each of these proteins . therefore we used the reductive insulin assay to determine a corresponding catalytic activity of . the assay is based on the reduction of two interchain disulfide bonds between the a and b chains of insulin by dtt . the free b chain precipitates and turbidity formation can be measured at nm . thioredoxin from e. coli accelerates disulfide reduction about fold compared with the noncatalyzed reaction . recombinant lacking the n terminal amino acids was produced in e. coli and purified by affinity chromatography on ni _PROTEIN_ columns via the attached c terminal his tag . as shown in figure recombinant significantly accelerated insulin reduction compared with the control reactions that contained either recombinant galactosidase purified by the same procedure as or dtt only . e. coli thioredoxin also catalyzed insulin reduction however the precipitation rates revealed that this enzyme is roughly to times more efficient than . this result demonstrated that purified recombinant has disulfide reductase activity suggesting that is required for dithiol disulfide transactions in specific chloroplast located target proteins .
