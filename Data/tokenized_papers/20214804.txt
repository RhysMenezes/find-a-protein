puf proteins have important roles in controlling gene _PROTEIN_ at the post transcriptional level by promoting rna decay and repressing translation . the pumilio homology domain is a conserved region within puf proteins that binds to rna with sequence specificity . although puf proteins have been well characterized in animal and fungal _METHOD_ little is known about the structural and functional characteristics of puf like proteins in plants . the arabidopsis and rice genomes code for and puf like proteins respectively each possessing eight or fewer puf repeats in their pum hd . key amino acids in the pum hd of several of these proteins are conserved with those of animal and fungal homologs whereas other plant puf proteins demonstrate extensive variability in these amino acids . three dimensional modeling revealed that the predicted structure of this domain in plant puf proteins provides a suitable surface for binding rna . electrophoretic gel mobility shift experiments showed that the arabidopsis pum hd binds with high affinity to boxb of the drosophila nanos response element i _PROTEIN_ rna whereas a point mutation in the core of the _PROTEIN_ resulted in a significant reduction in binding affinity . transient _PROTEIN_ of several of the arabidopsis puf proteins as _METHOD_ protein fusions revealed a dynamic punctate cytoplasmic pattern of localization for most of these proteins . the presence of predicted _LOCATION_ export signals and accumulation of atpuf proteins in the _LOCATION_ after treatment of cells with leptomycin b demonstrated that shuttling of these proteins between the _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ is common among these proteins . in addition to the cytoplasmically enriched atpum proteins two atpum proteins showed _LOCATION_ targeting with enrichment in the nucleolus . the puf family of rna binding proteins in plants consists of a greater number of members than any other model species studied to date . this along with the amino acid variability observed within their pum hds suggests that these proteins may be involved in a wide range of post transcriptional regulatory events that are important in providing plants with the ability to respond rapidly to changes in environmental conditions and throughout development .
blastp and tblastn searches of the arabidopsis and rice genome databases were conducted using the drosophila pumilio pum hd amino acid sequence as the query sequence . this search revealed that both the arabidopsis and rice genomes encode strikingly large puf gene families that include and putative members respectively . a phylogenetic tree of the predicted arabidopsis and rice puf proteins was constructed based on the deduced amino acid sequence of their pum hd coding sequence . also included in the phylogenetic tree were representative puf sequences from the moss physcomitrella patens the green alga chlamydomonas reinhardtii and the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae as well as drosophila pumilio and human _PROTEIN_ . a maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree of the pum hds of arabidopsis rice and other plant and non plant species . the analysis is based on the deduced amino acid sequence of the pum hd domain from each predicted puf gene . the tree includes all members from arabidopsis and rice and representative members from physcomitrella patens chlamydomonas reinhardii saccharomyces cerevisiae as well as drosophila pumilio and human _PROTEIN_ . the arabidopsis genes are referred by their designated pum gene number that were reported by the national center for biotechnology information as well as their gene locus name . the rice clones are identified by their gene locus name only as standardized pum gene designations have not yet been established . maximum likelihood bootstrap values are shown above the nodes and bayesian posterior probability values are shown below the nodes . the bar at the bottom of the figure indicates the number of substitutions per site . the tree is rooted at its midpoint and thus its rooting should be interpreted as an hypothesis . the phylogentic tree identified several sub families of proteins that were assigned into groups based on monophyly . group i was the most extensive of all groups and contained at least one puf member from each of the species that were included in this analysis . this group corresponds to the 'pumilio cluster of proteins that was categorized previously . group ii contained plant algal and yeast proteins whereas groups iii iv and v contained plant members only . a number of proteins are more divergent and do not appear to belong to any of the major branches that were identified in this analysis . some arabidopsis and rice puf genes appear to be orthologs as they demonstrate a high degree of sequence conservation in the pum hd . additionally two chlamydomonas proteins also appear to be orthologs with plant puf proteins . gene expansion through tandem duplication is also evident from this analysis . atpum and are clustered in one region of chromosome and other tandemly located genes are also evident . greater than half of the arabidopsis and rice puf proteins possess eight imperfect tandem puf repeats . this is consistent with the number of puf repeats present in most non plant puf proteins although examples of functional puf proteins with fewer than eight repeats have been identified _PROTEIN_ . the remaining arabidopsis and rice puf proteins lack one or more of these repeats with some possessing only two or three obvious repeats . a number of core residues are uniquely conserved within each of the eight puf repeats thereby allowing us to determine the identity of each repeat and whether a specific repeat is absent or truncated . crystallographic studies have demonstrated that the eight tandem puf repeats of the human pum hd are flanked by two imperfect pseudorepeats . regions resembling these pseudorepeats are present in several of the arabidopsis and rice proteins . puf proteins from other species often contain large regions of low complexity _PROTEIN_ . although isolated short regions of repeated amino acids are observed in some arabidopsis and rice puf proteins extensive stretches of low complexity sequence are not observed in these proteins . the tandemly positioned rice open reading frames and possess amino and _PROTEIN_ ends of the pum hd respectively . analysis of the genomic dna region that separates the two sequences identified a transposon that likely inserted within a full length pum hd from the ancestral puf protein . interestingly there is cdna support for suggesting that the encoded protein is functional . although and are placed in different positions in the phylogenetic tree likely belongs by association with in group i . placing in clade with is likely coincidental as there is little conservation between these two sequences . schematic line diagram comparing the primary structure of puf proteins in arabidopsis and rice . the numbered puf repeats in the pum hd of each protein are indicated and the and pseudorepeats are also identified . a conserved _LOCATION_ acid binding protein domain is present in several arabidopsis and rice pum hds . three additional puf repeats were identified outside of the pum hd in . two versions of the 'domain of unknown function were identified in . the length of each protein is indicated in parentheses . sequences that are supported by cdna sequences are identified . the and cdnas were amplified and sequenced independently _PROTEIN_ . those arabidopsis and rice genes that were not supported by cdna sequences were analyzed more extensively in an attempt to validate their predicted orfs . the presence of many closely related members within each of the arabidopsis and rice puf families allowed for sequence comparisons to provide a more confident assignment of orfs . notably the orfs of and that were listed in the database appear to have incorrectly predicted introns . in the case of this resulted in the merger of an orf encoding a self incompatibility protein with that of . an incorrectly predicted intron in was likely the result of a sequencing _LOCATION_ . this predicted intron contained sequence that was almost identical to sequence within the orf of the intronless gene a close relative of . based on this information the primary structure line _METHOD_ have been modified with the removal of the self incompatibility orf from and the intron from . the arabidopsis pum hd with the highest amino acid sequence similarity to the human _PROTEIN_ pum hd is sharing amino acid identity within this domain . the rice puf protein with the highest amino acid sequence identity to is possessing amino acid identity throughout the entire protein and identity within the pum hd . the and pum hds were included in an amino acid sequence alignment with pum hds from other plant and non plant species and this alignment demonstrated that extensive sequence conservation exists in each of the puf repeats . a comprehensive amino acid alignment of pum hds comparing the arabidopsis and rice pum hds with all of the p. patens c. reinhardtii s. cerevisiae human and drosophila pum hds demonstrated that the core of each repeat has a high degree of amino acid conservation across species . the p. patens genome contains puf like genes whereas four puf like genes are present in the c. reinhardtii genome . amino acid sequence alignment of the pum hd encoded by puf genes in various _METHOD_ . arabidopsis thaliana oryza sativa physcomitrella patens chlamydomonas reinhardii drosophila melanogaster homo sapiens caenorhabditis elegans and saccharomyces cerevisiae . identical amino acids are marked in black and similar residues are marked in gray . crystallographic analysis of puf proteins from other species has determined that the amino acids at positions and within each puf repeat provide the binding interface with rna bases using hydrogen bonds van der waals or stacking interactions _PROTEIN_ . surprisingly alignment of these triplet amino acids in puf repeats from the arabidopsis and rice pum hds demonstrated that there is complete conservation in some members and extensive variability in others . the amino acids at positions and from through are conserved with the corresponding triplets in human _PROTEIN_ and drosophila pumilio _PROTEIN_ . however through possess a single amino acid substitution in several of these amino acid triplets and through show extensive variability and are less easily predictable . the rice pum hds showed less variability in these triplets although uncommon triplet combinations were also evident . in some arabidopsis and rice pum hds amino acid substitutions in one puf repeat resulted in a triplet composition that is identical to that observed in a different puf repeat . for instance repeat in several of the arabidopsis and rice proteins possesses a cysteine at position resulting in an amino acid triplet that matches that of puf repeats and in the conserved proteins . interestingly this crq triplet is also found in repeat in some fungal and protozoan puf proteins _PROTEIN_ . several examples of unconventional triplets are present in the arabidopsis and rice puf repeats some of which are present in puf repeats of other species as well _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . alignment of amino acids in the pum hd that are predicted to interact with rna bases . sequence alignment of amino acid triplets at positions and in each puf repeat _PROTEIN_ from the arabidopsis and rice puf proteins . black shading identifies amino acids that are identical to the human _PROTEIN_ protein . the regions of the arabidopsis and rice puf proteins that lie outside of the pum hd are variable in primary sequence and length . these variable sequences are typically amino terminal extensions of each protein although _PROTEIN_ terminal extensions of variable length are also present in several proteins . a pfam search http //pfam.sanger.ac.uk/ of the polypeptide regions lying outside of the pum hd was performed in an attempt to identify significantly conserved domains that are present within the variable regions of the arabidopsis and rice puf proteins . is the only arabidopsis or rice puf protein that possesses puf repeat sequences that reside outside of the conserved pum hd region . additionally the amino terminal region of several related arabidopsis and rice proteins within group i possess a motif that resembles a _LOCATION_ acid binding protein domain _PROTEIN_ . finally the rice protein possesses two regions in its amino terminal extension that are similar to versions of a 'domain of unknown function a region found in some leucine zipper proteins . to gain insight into the _PROTEIN_ pattern of the arabidopsis puf genes in different tissues and in response to various environmental stimuli the transcription profiles for these genes were extracted from the microarray database . some overlap exists in the tissues/organs that exhibit maximal _PROTEIN_ between arabidopsis puf genes particularly those genes that are closely related . each of the puf genes showed a significant change in _PROTEIN_ pattern in response to at least one abiotic or biotic stimulus . extensive variability exists in the type of response to these stimuli even between genes that are closely related . atpum transcript _PROTEIN_ based on available public database information . a homology modeling approach was used to gain insight into whether plant pum hds adopt the typical crescent shaped three dimensional structure similar to that of the pum hds from human drosophila and yeast puf proteins . the three dimensional models of the and pum hds bound to boxb of the hunchback mrna _PROTEIN_ were constructed using the crystal structure of the pum hd from human _PROTEIN_ bound to the _PROTEIN_ rna _PROTEIN_ as a template for homology modeling . this structure was determined at resolution and provides the most reliable template currently available for modeling the nature of protein rna interactions from plant pum hds . notably only interactions between puf repeats to and the bound rna could be modeled since the rna templates for the complexes determined at high resolution only included residues to of box b from _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . the homology models of the and pum hd bound to the _PROTEIN_ indicate that plant pum hds can form interactions with rna in a manner similar to that observed in the human pum hd rna complexes _PROTEIN_ . the conserved amino acid triplets at position and of each repeat in and form interactions with rna bases in the modeled structure . most of the hydrogen bonds and van der waals contacts formed by amino acids at positions and in the human pum hd rna crystal structures _PROTEIN_ are also observed in the models of the plant pum hd rna complexes . the stacking interactions between residues at position and adjacent bases are also conserved . in addition to similarities in the structures of the puf repeats the homology models also indicate that a region lying between the seventh and eighth puf repeats can form an extended loop structure on the convex surface of the domain similar to that observed in the human and drosophila pum hd proteins . in drosophila this loop interacts with the translational co repressors nos and brat . models of the plant pum hd bound to rna . ribbon and stick models of the pum hds of and bound to the rna bases of box of the _PROTEIN_ that interact with puf repeats to . the rna is shown as a ball and stick model . in the ribbon _METHOD_ the amino acid side chains that interact with the watson crick edge of each base are shown in green and those that provide potential stacking interactions are colored magenta . in the stick models only the amino acid side chains that contact rna bases are shown . the extended loop between repeat and is identified . sequence alignment of residues in helix of repeats that provide putative rna contact sites on the concave surface of the pum hd of and . numbers above the sequences represent the position of each amino acid each puf repeat . numbers in brackets refer to the position of the first amino acid in the complete and polypeptide sequence . boxes surround the amino acid residues at positions and . schematic diagram showing the protein rna contacts in the models of the and pum hds bound to the _PROTEIN_ . dotted lines indicate potential hydrogen bonds dashed lines indicate potential stacking interactions and indicates potential van der waals interactions . distances between _METHOD_ indicated on the lines are indicated in _METHOD_ . a similar approach was used to model the structure of the pum hd of a puf protein that varies significantly in the identity of puf repeat amino acid residues at positions and . the homology model for the pum hd rna complex indicates that interactions between puf repeats and with the highly conserved ugu sequence at the centre of box b are conserved in and . however the model also shows that the remaining puf repeats fail to form many of the stacking interactions and hydrogen bond interactions that are observed in and . as a result we predict that the binding affinity of for the _PROTEIN_ is lower than that of and may prefer rna targets that are different from the _PROTEIN_ outside of the ugu core . it is also interesting to note that the model reveals the presence of extended loops on the convex surface of the protein between puf repeats and as well as repeats and . models of the pum hd bound to rna . ribbon and stick models of the pum hd of bound to the core nucleotides of box of the _PROTEIN_ . sequence alignment of residues in helix of repeats that provide putative rna contact sites on the concave surface of the pum hd . schematic diagram showing the protein rna contacts in the model of the pum hd . legend details are described in figure . to determine if the pum hd binds rna as is predicted by structural modeling electrophoresis mobility shift assays _METHOD_ were performed . two synthetic nucleotide rnas were used in these assays . the first was a wildtype nanos response element _PROTEIN_ that matched a region from boxb of the hunchback _PROTEIN_ . this rna oligonucleotide _PROTEIN_ was identical in sequence to one used in a previous study that analyzed the binding affinity of the human pum hd to rna _PROTEIN_ . the second rna oligonucleotide was a variant form of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ that contained a single nucleotide change in the highly conserved core of the puf repeat binding site . this mutant _PROTEIN_ was shown to have approximately fold reduced affinity for the human pum hd _PROTEIN_ . the _METHOD_ experiments demonstrated that the pum hd bound effectively to the wildtype _PROTEIN_ whereas binding to the mutant _PROTEIN_ was significantly lower . competition assays were performed to further demonstrate the specificity of the pum hd interaction with wildtype _PROTEIN_ . the addition of fold excess concentration of cold mutant _PROTEIN_ competitor to the assay mixture only slightly reduced the binding of wildtype _PROTEIN_ to the pum hd whereas the addition of excess cold wildtype _PROTEIN_ competitor completely eliminated any detectable interaction between the protein and the mutant _PROTEIN_ . atpum hd demonstrates binding specificity to wildtype _PROTEIN_ . _METHOD_ using purified _PROTEIN_ pum hd and wildtype or point mutated _PROTEIN_ . _METHOD_ assays using the wildtype _PROTEIN_ or mutant _PROTEIN_ rna oligonucleotide in the absence or presence of _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ pum hd . unbound radiolabelled rna shifts to a high molecular weight complex when bound to _PROTEIN_ pum hd . the fraction of bound rna was determined for each reaction . fold excess non labelled mutant _PROTEIN_ was added to the reaction containing labelled wt _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . conversely fold excess of non labelled wildtype _PROTEIN_ was added to the reaction containing labelled mutant _PROTEIN_ rna . the underlined rna sequence corresponds to cognate rna that interacts with repeats through in the drosophila pumilio pum hd . _METHOD_ titration of wt _PROTEIN_ and increasing concentrations of _PROTEIN_ pum hd . the protein concentrations were and nm . the fraction of bound wt rna as a function of _PROTEIN_ pum hd from the _METHOD_ in was plotted and the dissociation constant was determined . _METHOD_ titration of mutant _PROTEIN_ and increasing concentrations of _PROTEIN_ pum hd . the protein concentrations were and nm . _METHOD_ titration experiments were conducted to determine the binding affinity of the pum hd to the wildtype and mutant _PROTEIN_ . the pum hd bound to wildtype _PROTEIN_ with an apparent dissociation constant of nm . this value is > fold higher than was observed for drosophila pumilio pum hd binding to the _PROTEIN_ but within the range observed for other puf protein interactions with their cognate rnas _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . the binding affinity of the protein to the mutant _PROTEIN_ was significantly lower than to wildtype rna . although a protein mutant _PROTEIN_ complex was apparent at an pum hd concentration of nm the interaction remained weak at a protein concentration of nm as seen by the diffuse nature of the shifted band . however only a small amount of free rna was present in the nm and nm samples indicating that the low affinity binding of the atpum hd to the rna resulted in a dissociation of the complex during electrophoresis . thus the instability of the complex did not allow for an accurate determination of the dissociation constant . however based on the amount of free rna in each lane the dissociation constant value for the protein bound to mutant _PROTEIN_ appears in the range of to nm . to provide insight into the subcellular localization patterns of the arabidopsis puf proteins several of these proteins were transiently _PROTEIN_ as fusions to the amino terminus of either _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ in onion or fava bean epidermal cells . in total nine atpum proteins were successfully _PROTEIN_ as _METHOD_ protein fusions . seven of the fusion proteins localized to cytoplasmic structures that were visible as puncta microns or less in diameter . however large protein aggregates were occasionally observed in some cells likely resulting from higher levels of _PROTEIN_ of the fusion protein . in epidermal cells that demonstrated active cytoplasmic streaming the _METHOD_ particles were occasionally dynamic demonstrating stop and go movements that reached peak velocities of up to five microns/second . particle movement ceased when cells were treated with the actin destabilizing agent latrunculin b indicating that the actin _LOCATION_ was responsible for driving particle movement . the microtubule disrupting agent oryzalin did not noticeably affect the movement of the atpum containing particles . in addition to punctate cytoplasmic staining strong _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ was often observed and was more prevalent in cells _PROTEIN_ specific _METHOD_ protein fusions . this observation suggested that some fusion proteins shuttle between the _LOCATION_ and cytoplasm . _LOCATION_ localization and export may be common features for most of the atpum proteins as out of the proteins have a predicted leucine rich _LOCATION_ export signal http //www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/netnes/ with and as exceptions . the predicted nes sequences are located in the variable amino terminal region of each protein which in several atpum proteins is extremely short . nes containing proteins are dependent on _PROTEIN_ for export from the _LOCATION_ and are sensitive to export inhibition by leptomycin b. epidermal cells _PROTEIN_ each of the cytoplasmic punctate atpum _METHOD_ protein fusions shown in figures through were treated with leptomycin b . we observed that all but one fusion protein _METHOD_ demonstrated an accumulation of _METHOD_ signal in the _LOCATION_ after treatment with leptomycin b . this indicated that atpum proteins shuttle between the cytoplasm and the _LOCATION_ via a crm mediated pathway . subcellular localization of atpum proteins . representative _METHOD_ images of cells _PROTEIN_ atpum proteins fused to the amino terminus of _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ in onion or fava bean epidermal cells . _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_

results in an enrichment of _METHOD_ but not _METHOD_ in the _LOCATION_ . bar microns . two atpum _METHOD_ fusion proteins _METHOD_ _METHOD_ had a different subcellular localization pattern from the others demonstrating only _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ that was enriched within nucleolar like structures . co _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ with a nucleolar targeted marker protein _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ confirmed that these structures were indeed nucleoli . interestingly and are the only arabidopsis puf proteins with long polypeptide extensions at the _PROTEIN_ terminal end of the pum hd . nucleolar localization signals are not easily predictable however these signals are often enriched in the basic amino acids lysine and arginine two amino acids that are well represented in the _PROTEIN_ terminal regions of and . these two proteins have predicted _LOCATION_ localization signals . possesses a predicted nls at position near the _PROTEIN_ terminal end of the protein and has two predicted nls sequences near the amino terminal end . and co localize with the nucleolar marker _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . bar micron . to determine whether the various atpum proteins were segregated into distinct cytoplasmic particles several pairs of atpum _METHOD_ protein fusions _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ were co _PROTEIN_ in epidermal cells . each pair of co _PROTEIN_ atpum fusion proteins co localized within the same cytoplasmic particles . however there was a frequent concentration bias of either _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ _METHOD_ in co localizing particles indicating that atpum proteins were not necessarily represented in equimolar concentrations within each particle .
basic local alignment search tool analyses were performed to identify arabidopsis and rice genes that encode regions of the conserved pum hd . the amino acid sequence of the drosophila pum hd was
