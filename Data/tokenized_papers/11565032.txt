positional information is pivotal for establishing developmental patterning in plants but little is known about the underlying signalling _METHOD_ . the arabidopsis root radial pattern is generated through stereotyped division of initial cells and the subsequent acquisition of cell fate . short root mutants do not undergo the longitudinal cell division of the cortex/endodermis initial daughter cell resulting in a single cell layer with only cortex attributes . thus _PROTEIN_ is necessary for both cell division and endodermis specification . _PROTEIN_ messenger rna is found exclusively in the stele cells internal to the endodermis and cortex indicating that it has a non cell autonomous mode of action . here we show that the _PROTEIN_ protein a putative transcription _PROTEIN_ moves from the stele to a single layer of adjacent cells where it enters the _LOCATION_ . ectopic _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ driven by the promoter of the downstream gene scarecrow _PROTEIN_ results in autocatalytic reinforcement of _PROTEIN_ signalling producing altered cell fates and multiplication of cell layers . these results support a model in which _PROTEIN_ protein acts both as a signal from the stele and as an activator of endodermal cell fate and _PROTEIN_ mediated cell division .
to determine whether _PROTEIN_ protein could move between cells we fused in frame the coding regions of _PROTEIN_ and green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ under the control of the kilobase upstream region of _PROTEIN_ . this promoter element confers an _PROTEIN_ pattern that matches the localization of _PROTEIN_ mrna . transforming the shr mutant with the fusion construct resulted in rescue of the root radial pattern with appropriate cell fate specification indicating that the fusion protein retained the _PROTEIN_ activity necessary for root patterning . we analysed the localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ by both confocal and multi photon laser scanning microscopy . _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was found not only in the stele but also in all cells immediately adjacent to the stele . these include the quiescent centre _PROTEIN_ the cortex/endodermis initial and daughter cells as well as all cells of the endodermis . _PROTEIN_ transcripts have never been detected in any of these cells either by in situ hybridization or indirectly through _PROTEIN_ promoter reporter gene fusions . from the confocal images it appeared that although _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was localized to both the _LOCATION_ and the cytoplasm in the stele it was primarily localized to the _LOCATION_ in the adjacent layer . this was confirmed with multi photon microscopy . at the limit of resolution of multi photon imaging we could not detect _METHOD_ in cortex or epidermal cells nor in any other organelles or subcellular structures besides the _LOCATION_ in endodermal cells . to confirm this localization of _PROTEIN_ protein we produced affinity purified antibodies to recombinant _PROTEIN_ protein . the specificity of the antibody was analysed on shr mutant roots where no binding was detected . on transverse sections from just above the root meristem the antibodies consistently decorated _LOCATION_ of endodermal cells . in the stele there was more uniform binding of the antibodies with occasional stronger staining observed in _LOCATION_ . in sections at the level of the _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ localized _PROTEIN_ protein was evident in the four _PROTEIN_ cells as well as in the eight surrounding cortex/endodermis initial cells . in the next serial section strong staining was detected in the initial daughter cells after their longitudinal cell division . notably in two of the eight pairs of daughter cells _PROTEIN_ was localized in both _LOCATION_ resulting from the longitudinal division whereas in the remaining six pairs only the inner _LOCATION_ appears to contain _PROTEIN_ protein . this is probably due to the non synchronous division of these cells which results in slightly different times after division being analysed in the pairs of _LOCATION_ . together these results indicate that _PROTEIN_ is equally partitioned into the two daughter _LOCATION_ after the longitudinal cell division but _PROTEIN_ levels are _PROTEIN_ only in the _LOCATION_ of the inner cell . the simplest explanation for the difference in localization patterns of _PROTEIN_ mrna and protein is movement of _PROTEIN_ protein from the stele to the adjacent layer . an alternative hypothesis is an abnormally rapid degradation of _PROTEIN_ mrna transcribed in or transported to the adjacent layer . we have shown however that when _PROTEIN_ is driven by the constitutive cauliflower mosaic virus promoter high levels of _PROTEIN_ mrna accumulate in cells outside the stele . moreover both the rapid loss of _PROTEIN_ immunostaining in outer daughter cells of the longitudinal division and the lack of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ in the first cell of the cortex lineage in the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ lines indicate that _PROTEIN_ protein has a relatively short half life . thus the discrepancy between the mrna and protein localization is not due to the protein having a much lower turnover rate than the mrna . we therefore conclude that _PROTEIN_ protein moves from the stele to the single adjacent layer . to understand better the role of _PROTEIN_ protein in specifying cell fate and mediating cell division in the root we generated transgenic plants in which _PROTEIN_ is transcribed in the adjacent layer . the kb _PROTEIN_ promoter which confers _PROTEIN_ in all cells of the adjacent layer was fused to the full length _PROTEIN_ coding region _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . this construct was introduced into wild type plants either with or without a _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ reporter . thirteen independent lines showed an increased number of cell layers in the root . the supernumerary cell layers exhibited a high degree of radial symmetry . this is in contrast to a phenotype obtained with ectopic _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ by the promoter which displayed fairly chaotic division patterns . the differentiation status of root cells in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ lines was initially analysed with two monoclonal antibodies specific to epitopes found in the different cell layers the antibody recognizes an arabinogalactan epitope on the endodermis and on some stele cells and the ccrc antibody recognizes a _PROTEIN_ epitope in cortex and epidermis cell walls . stained all the cell layers except the outermost layer indicating the presence of endodermal characters in these cells . in the outermost layer a few cells were occasionally stained with . when the same section was treated with ccrc only the outermost layer was stained . notably the stained cells in the outermost layer were not stained by the ccrc antibody suggesting that endodermal specification can override cortex and/or epidermal specification . acquisition of endodermal characters in the supernumerary layers was confirmed by histochemical staining for the _PROTEIN_ strip a cell wall deposit of hydrophobic _PROTEIN_ that occurs specifically in the endodermis . staining of the _PROTEIN_ strip was detected in most if not all of the cells between the stele and the outermost cell layer . because _PROTEIN_ protein _METHOD_ to move not only to the endodermis but also to the _PROTEIN_ we determined the status of _PROTEIN_ cells in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ lines . a _METHOD_ marker line _PROTEIN_ that exhibits highly specific _PROTEIN_ in the _PROTEIN_ was crossed to a strong _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ line . the plants had an increased number of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ cells as compared with wild type roots . these cells were organized into supernumerary layers between the stele and the root cap . the supernumerary endodermis layers appear to converge on these _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ cells . crosses to root cap specific marker lines indicated that neither the _PROTEIN_ root cap nor the columella root cap was affected in the transgenic roots . to determine whether the cell fate changes observed in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ lines correlated with the presence of _PROTEIN_ protein we performed immunolocalization with the anti _PROTEIN_ antibodies in backgrounds that contained tissue specific reporters . we crossed a strong _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ line with the marker lines _PROTEIN_ gus and _PROTEIN_ which show specific _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in endodermis non hair epidermal cells and _PROTEIN_ cells respectively . the roots of plants from each cross were first stained for gus activity and then fixed sectioned and processed for _PROTEIN_ immunolocalization . consistent with the supernumerary cells having endodermal characters the gus stain was found in all cells between the stele and the outermost layer . immunolocalization of _PROTEIN_ on the same section showed a strong signal in the gus _PROTEIN_ cells whereas staining was rarely detected in cells of the outermost layer . in a similar analysis of the cross with the _PROTEIN_ gus line gus staining was detected only in cells of the outermost layer that were in contact with a single underlying cell . contact with two underlying cortex cells is normally required for the acquisition of hair cell fate and _PROTEIN_ is specifically _PROTEIN_ in the non hair epidermal cells . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ background is therefore analogous to wild type indicating that the underlying cells need not be cortex for correct specification to occur . occasionally we found cells in the outermost layer in which there was no gus staining even though they were situated over a single underlying cell . the _PROTEIN_ immunostain revealed the presence of _PROTEIN_ protein in these cells . these results indicate that when _PROTEIN_ is found in cells of the outermost layer it is sufficient to alter their cell fate . in the analysis of the cross with the _PROTEIN_ line the gus stain was found in the cell layers that extend toward the root cap from the base of the vascular cylinder . immunostaining of this section revealed the presence of the _PROTEIN_ protein in all of the gus _PROTEIN_ layers suggesting that production of multiple _PROTEIN_ layers was a result of _PROTEIN_ in these cells . the formation of multiple _PROTEIN_ layers should give rise to multiple layers of endodermis/cortex initial cells immediately adjacent to them . this idea is based on laser ablation experiments that showed that _PROTEIN_ cells have a role in _PROTEIN_ the surrounding initial cells by repressing their differentiation . formation of the supernumerary endodermis layers is unlikely to result solely from the presence of the ectopic _PROTEIN_ layers however because the number of supernumerary endodermis layers exceeds by more than twofold the number of _PROTEIN_ layers . to determine whether _PROTEIN_ is involved in production of the supernumerary layers we analysed _PROTEIN_ transcription in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ lines . previous analyses showed that levels of _PROTEIN_ rna were sharply reduced in shr mutants suggesting that _PROTEIN_ is required for full transcriptional activation of _PROTEIN_ . consistent with this model we observed strong _METHOD_ _METHOD_ from the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ marker in the supernumerary cell layers . the presence of _PROTEIN_ protein correlated well with the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ as revealed by immunostaining of serial sections with either _PROTEIN_ or _METHOD_ antibodies . to determine whether _PROTEIN_ activity was necessary for the ectopic cell divisions in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ lines we crossed a strong _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ line with the scr mutant which has no detectable _PROTEIN_ rna . in plants carrying the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ transgene and homozygous for the scr allele the radial pattern was identical to that of the scr mutant . the progeny of a backcross to wild type had the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ radial pattern whereas all selfed progeny tested had the scr mutant radial pattern . this shows that the lack of ectopic cell divisions in the scr background was not a consequence of inactivation of the transgene per se . in conclusion the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ phenotype requires a functional _PROTEIN_ gene indicating that _PROTEIN_ activation of _PROTEIN_ is necessary for the longitudinal cell divisions that are essential for radial patterning . although the longitudinal division of the cortex/endodermal initial daughter does not take place in scr mutants the resulting single mutant cell layer has differentiated attributes of both cortex and endodermis . to determine whether _PROTEIN_ protein can still translocate to the single mutant tissue layer we crossed the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein line to the scr mutant . in plants carrying the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgene and homozygous for the scr allele _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was clearly visible in the _LOCATION_ of the mutant layer . we conclude that _PROTEIN_ protein movement and _LOCATION_ localization do not require _PROTEIN_ activity . movement of _PROTEIN_ protein provides a simple model to explain the non cell autonomous function of _PROTEIN_ required for root radial patterning . in this hypothesis _PROTEIN_ has three functions transmission of positional information through its own movement activation of _PROTEIN_ and cell fate specification . the last two functions would require movement of _PROTEIN_ protein . to test this model we enlarged the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ domain and analysed how well cell differentiation and activation of _PROTEIN_ correlated with localization of _PROTEIN_ protein . all the observed phenotypes can be explained by applying the model . in transgenic _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plants activation of _PROTEIN_ by _PROTEIN_ results in in situ production of _PROTEIN_ in the adjacent layer because the _PROTEIN_ coding region is under control of the _PROTEIN_ promoter . this creates an autocatalytic reinforcement process of _PROTEIN_ signalling . the consequences of this reinforcement are _PROTEIN_ dependent cell division and replacement of cortex cell fate with endodermis cell fate which is mediated by the cell fate specification function of _PROTEIN_ . the ectopic presence of _PROTEIN_ in the outer daughter cell could be due to influx of the _PROTEIN_ produced from the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ transgene in the inner daughter cell or to de novo transcription from the transgene in the outer daughter cell mediated by the residual _PROTEIN_ or to a combination of both . in the cells immediately below the stele the reinforcement process and cell fate specification result in multiple layers of _PROTEIN_ . this indicates that cell fate specification by _PROTEIN_ requires yet unidentified positional cues that are not mediated by _PROTEIN_ because the presence of _PROTEIN_ can result in different fates when cells are in different positions . although our study does not address the pathway of _PROTEIN_ movement previous work suggests that movement is likely to be through plasmodesmata . in the shoot meristem intercellular trafficking of transcription _PROTEIN_ has been reported for structurally unrelated proteins . the biological relevance of this movement is not evident because in wild type plants these proteins are found in an identical domain as their cognate rna . the one exception the maize _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ homeobox protein has been reported to move to the outermost layer of the shoot meristem where its rna was not detected . but there is no evidence that protein presence in the outermost layer is essential for _PROTEIN_ activity . in contrast because the non cell autonomous activity of _PROTEIN_ is essential for patterning the adjacent cell layer movement of _PROTEIN_ protein _METHOD_ to have an integral role in root radial pattern formation . in summary we have shown that _PROTEIN_ protein can move and its translocation provides a simple model for its non cell autonomous activity in root radial patterning . _LOCATION_ localization of _PROTEIN_ in the adjacent layer and activation of _PROTEIN_ strongly suggest that _PROTEIN_ is directly involved in transcriptional regulation in these cells . this simple strategy which uses a single protein for both positional signalling and cell fate determination may have been important in the evolution of land plants to acquire efficient vascular function by forming radially organized tissues .
to generate an in frame fusion of _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ we introduced restriction sites at both ends of the coding sequences for _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ . a linker sequence encoding asp pro gly was inserted between _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ . the resulting dna fragment was used to replace the coding region of a kb _PROTEIN_ gene fragment fused to the nopaline synthase region in the binary vector . to make the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ construct we fused a kb _PROTEIN_ region and the kb _PROTEIN_ coding region in the pbih vector which had been modified from to confer hygromycin resistance . the plasmids were electroporated into agrobacterium strain which then was used to transform arabidopsis plants by the floral dip method . the _PROTEIN_ strip and and ccrc antibody stains were performed as described . we carried out and ccrc antibody stains on the same section using appropriate secondary antibodies . _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and propidium iodide stained cell walls in the root were observed by confocal microscopy as described . multi photon microscopy was performed on a bio rad _PROTEIN_ multiphoton microscope equipped with a coherent mira f infrared pulsed laser with operation wavelength of nm . we carried out gus staining as described . some microscopic images were processed with photoshop _METHOD_ to increase contrast . the _PROTEIN_ polypeptide lacking the amino terminal amino acids was _PROTEIN_ as a fusion protein to either thioredoxin _PROTEIN_ or maltose binding protein _PROTEIN_ using and pet mal respectively . pet mal was a hybrid plasmid made from and . we used trx _PROTEIN_ to raise antisera and immobilized mbp _PROTEIN_ on a gel _PROTEIN_ for affinity purification of the antisera . the proteins were induced in escherichia coli strain . the insoluble trx _PROTEIN_ protein was solubilized with m urea and purified with the hisbind resin buffer kit . the purified trx _PROTEIN_ was dialysed concentrated and injected into rabbits at covance research products . the soluble mbp _PROTEIN_ protein was affinity purified with amylose resin and then coupled to nhs activated sepharose fast flow . in parallel we extracted total soluble protein from the shr mutant roots and immobilized it on the sepharose gel as above . the antisera were diluted fold in tbst buffer tween and incubated with the mbp _PROTEIN_ gel overnight with gentle agitation at . the gel was washed once with tbst and once with cbst tween . the bound antibodies were then eluted with gbst tween and immediately neutralized by adding a volume of m tris hcl ph . this fraction was further absorbed to the shr protein gel for h at . the final unbound fraction was used for immunolocalization . pre immune serum purified in the same way showed no specific binding to wild type root sections . arabidopsis roots were fixed in paraformaldehyde in _PROTEIN_ overnight at washed twice with _PROTEIN_ and embedded in agarose . the roots in excised agarose blocks were passed through an ethanol series followed by hemode and then embedded in paraplast x tra . sections were cut and placed on silane coated slides . after dewaxing and rehydration the sections were treated with hcl and proteinase k as described with minor modifications . after blocking with tbst containing bovine serum albumin and goat serum for h at room temperature the sections were incubated with the purified anti _PROTEIN_ antibodies in the blocking solution overnight at room temperature . slides were given six min washes with tbst and incubated with alkali phosphatase conjugated anti rabbit immunoglobulin for h at room temperature . after washing four times in tbst and twice in tbs the signal was developed with nbt/bcip in m tris hcl ph m nacl mm levamisole for h at room temperature .
