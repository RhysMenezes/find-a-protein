prenylation is a posttranslational protein modification essential for developmental processes and response to abscisic acid . following prenylation the three c terminal residues are proteoliticaly removed and in turn the free _PROTEIN_ group of the isoprenyl cysteine is methylated . the proteolysis and methylation collectively referred to as caax processing are catalyzed by _PROTEIN_ endoprotease or _PROTEIN_ endoprotease and by an isoprenyl cysteine methyltransferase . arabidopsis contains single _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and two icmt homologs . here we show that in yeast promoted a mating _PROTEIN_ secretion and _LOCATION_ localization of a rop _PROTEIN_ . furthermore green _METHOD_ protein fusion proteins of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are colocalized in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ indicating that prenylated proteins reach this compartment and that caax processing is likely required for subcellular targeting . _PROTEIN_ can process yeast a _PROTEIN_ more efficiently than _PROTEIN_ . sequence and mutational analyses revealed that the higher activity _PROTEIN_ is conferred by five residues which are conserved between yeast _PROTEIN_ human icmt and _PROTEIN_ but not in _PROTEIN_ . quantitative real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and microarray data show that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is significantly lower compared to _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ null mutants have a wild type phenotype indicating that its function is redundant . however aticmt rnai lines had fasciated inflorescence _METHOD_ altered phylotaxis and developed multiple buds without stem elongation . the phenotype of the icmt rnai lines is similar to farnesyltransferase subunit mutant enhanced response to abscisic but is more subtle . collectively the data suggest that _PROTEIN_ is likely the major icmt and that methylation modulates activity of prenylated proteins .
_PROTEIN_ is considered as the major caax protease . the function of was tested by complementation in yeast using pheromone diffusion halo assays . this assay can be used to quantitatively evaluate caax processing efficiency in vivo since the size of the growth inhibition halos correspond to the efficiency of a _PROTEIN_ processing . complemented a _PROTEIN_ secretion in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant yeast strain when _PROTEIN_ from a high copy number plasmid . unlike _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ can only catalyze caax proteolysis but not the additional proteolytic step required for maturation and of a _PROTEIN_ and its efficient secretion . the halos that formed around the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ cells were smaller compared to the halos that formed around the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ cells indicating that a _PROTEIN_ secretion was indeed less efficient . the halos that formed around _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ wild type cells were bigger than either _PROTEIN_ or complemented cells indicating that a _PROTEIN_ processing by neither plant caax proteases was as efficient as by yeast _PROTEIN_ . these data corroborated functional analysis of function in vitro . to determine whether can process plant target proteins we created a yeast strain in which and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ were coexpressed in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutant background . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is a type ii rop/rac _PROTEIN_ that is farnesylated in yeast . in wild type _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ background _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was localized in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and endomembrane . in contrast in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant background _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was only localized in the endomembrane fraction . coexpression of restored _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ localization of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ confirming that processed _PROTEIN_ . the nonprenylated _METHOD_ _METHOD_ mutant in which the prenyl acceptor cys was mutated to ser was dispersed in the cytoplasm following _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ wild type cells . these data show that prenylation promotes association of proteins with the endomembrane system while caax processing is required for subcellular targeting . we have previously demonstrated that _PROTEIN_ is localized in the _LOCATION_ and that _PROTEIN_ is localized in endomembranes . if in plants too prenylated proteins reach the _LOCATION_ where they undergo caax processing _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ should also be localized in the _LOCATION_ . to test this assumption the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ was determined . following transient _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ fusion proteins had typical to _LOCATION_ reticulate and perinuclear subcellular distribution patterns . colocalization analysis of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and together with the _LOCATION_ marker _LOCATION_ mcherry were carried out to confirm the _LOCATION_ localization . the results show that fusion proteins of all three caax processing enzymes were colocalized with the marker confirming their _LOCATION_ localization . colocalization of cyan _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ with yellow _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ with _METHOD_ was used to further confirm the _LOCATION_ colocalization of the caax processing enzymes in the _LOCATION_ . based on its reversibility the isoprenyl _PROTEIN_ methylation step has been suggested to play a regulatory role . recently a prenyl cys methylesterase has been identified in arabidopsis suggesting that methylation/demethylation cycles of prenylated proteins may regulate their function . this has prompted us to study the role of prenyl cys methytransferases and their function in arabidopsis in vitro _PROTEIN_ was shown to be more active than _PROTEIN_ . sequence comparison highlighted five amino acids that are conserved between _PROTEIN_ and yeast _PROTEIN_ and differ in _PROTEIN_ . these residues include and in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ and in _PROTEIN_ and in _PROTEIN_ and and _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ . interestingly these residues are also structurally conserved in human and moss physcomitrella patens icmt proteins . hydropathy plot analysis showed that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ have six to eight transmembrane helices and that their overall topology is similar to _PROTEIN_ . interestingly all the five residues that are conserved between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ hsicmt and ppicmt and differ in _PROTEIN_ are located on hydrophylic domains which were shown to be essential for _PROTEIN_ activity . pheromone diffusion halo assays were carried out to compare the activities of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in yeast and whether differences in their ability to process a _PROTEIN_ correspond to the structural conservation between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . the halos that formed around _PROTEIN_ mutant cells that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ from a high copy number plasmid were larger than the halos that formed around _PROTEIN_ cells that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ that are comparable in size to the halos that formed around wild type _PROTEIN_ cells . when _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ from a single copy cen plasmid the halo size was smaller indicating that methylation of a _PROTEIN_ by _PROTEIN_ was less efficient than by yeast _PROTEIN_ . an _PROTEIN_ mutant _PROTEIN_ harboring point mutations that converted five amino acids to their corresponding residues in _PROTEIN_ was created . the halos that formed around _PROTEIN_ cells that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were comparable to the halos that formed around _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ cells . halo sizes were calculated relative to wild type _PROTEIN_ cells average size of which was taken as . the average halo size around _PROTEIN_ complemented cells _PROTEIN_ was of wild type _PROTEIN_ cells with a se of . the average halo sizes around _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ complemented cells _PROTEIN_ were and respectively . these results indicated that the a _PROTEIN_ was processed at similar efficiencies by _PROTEIN_ and the mutant _PROTEIN_ and confirmed that the reduced activity of _PROTEIN_ results from changes in structurally conserved residues rather than technical _METHOD_ of the experimental setup . interestingly activity of the _PROTEIN_ single mutant and the _PROTEIN_ triple mutant was similar to wild type _PROTEIN_ suggesting that all five residues are critical for efficient icmt activity . real time quantitative rt pcr experiments showed that _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ at significantly higher levels compared to _PROTEIN_ . the q pcr data were corroborated by examining microarray _PROTEIN_ data using genevestigator . the microarray data show that _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ is low in most tissues and throughout development and that in all cases the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ is higher . the q pcr analyses showed that is _PROTEIN_ at similar levels to _PROTEIN_ . unfortunately is currently not represented on the _PROTEIN_ affymetrix microarray _PROTEIN_ and thus whole genome analysis of its _PROTEIN_ is currently unavailable . the high sensitivity of the q pcr enabled detection of slightly higher relative _PROTEIN_ levels of and _PROTEIN_ in flowers and leaves relative to roots and seedlings . the activity and _PROTEIN_ data suggested that _PROTEIN_ has a minor or restricted function and that _PROTEIN_ is likely the major isoprenyl methyltransferase in arabidopsis . mutant analyses were carried out to test this assumption . an arabidopsis line with a t dna insertion three nucleotides upstream of the termination tga codon of _PROTEIN_ was identified in screens of the university of wisconsin biotechnology center t dna collection . no rna was detected in _PROTEIN_ homozygote mutant plants by rt pcr with _PROTEIN_ gene specific primers indicating the mutant is a null . an rt pcr reaction on the same rna template using _PROTEIN_ specific primers showed that the mutation had no effect on its _PROTEIN_ . cloning and sequencing showed that the weak band that was amplified by the _PROTEIN_ specific primers was _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ plants had no visible phenotype including increased sensitivity to aba indicating that _PROTEIN_ function is redundant with _PROTEIN_ . unfortunately no mutant with compromised _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ has been identified . to further explore the function of isoprenyl cys methylation in plants we generated icmt rnai plants . these plants _PROTEIN_ two bp fragments of the _PROTEIN_ coding region in reverse orientation . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ show approximately identity at the nucleotide level making it highly likely that the rnai construct would silence both icmt genes . one hundred and ten independent transgenic lines were isolated of which a total of had a similar abnormal phenotype . six independent lines were selected for further analysis . aticmtsil plants had altered _PROTEIN_ . flowers developed from the same region of the inflorescence stem with minimal or no elongation of the internodes . occasionally secondary axillary flowers developed within flowers indicating partial conversion of flowers into inflorescence . siliques developed without internode elongation . multiple buds developed in the axil of cauline leaves . all the plants developed fasciated bifurcated _METHOD_ . interestingly altered _PROTEIN_ fasciated _METHOD_ and development of axillary flowers were also observed in the _LOCATION_ pft subunit mutant plants suggesting functional relatedness of the two genes . unlike in _LOCATION_ and plp plants aticmtsil flowers did not have extra flower organs or additional rosette leaves and were not _PROTEIN_ flowering and partially male sterile . it was difficult to observe consistent reduction in mrna levels in the aticmtsil plants suggesting a posttranscriptional silencing mechanism . to prove that the phenotype of the plants was associated with the icmt rnai we monitored the cosegregation of the mutant phenotype and the kanamycin resistant selection marker . to this end approximately seedlings from each of three independent transgenic lines were grown on soil without selection and their phenotypes were scored . plants were allowed to self their seeds were harvested germinated on a kanamycin containing selection medium and the ratios between resistant and sensitive seedlings were determined . in turn plants were transferred from the selection plates to soil and their phenotypes were scored again . in nonsegregating populations in which all the plants had a mutant phenotype of the progeny were kanamycin resistant . the progeny of plants without a mutant phenotype were all kanamycin sensitive . the progeny of plants heterozygote to the rnai segregated in a to ratio with respect to the selection marker . all the kanamycin resistant plants showed a mutant phenotype after transferring to soil . in contrast rescued kanamycin sensitive plants that were transferred to soil did not show the mutant phenotype . the segregation analysis confirmed that the abnormal phenotype of the aticmtsil plants were associated with the aticmt rnai transgene .
