phytochrome a _PROTEIN_ is the primary photoreceptor mediating responses to far red light . among the _PROTEIN_ downstream signaling components far red elongated hypocotyl _PROTEIN_ is a genetically defined positive regulator of photomorphogenesis in far red light . both physiological and genomic characterization of the _PROTEIN_ mutants indicated a close functional relationship of _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ . here we showed that _PROTEIN_ is most abundant in young seedlings grown in darkness and is quickly down regulated during further seedling development and by light exposure . by using light insensitive promoter driven functional _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and green _METHOD_ protein _PROTEIN_ fusion proteins we showed that this down regulation of _PROTEIN_ protein abundance by light is largely at posttranscriptional level and most evident in the _LOCATION_ . the light triggered _PROTEIN_ protein reduction is primarily mediated through the proteasome dependent protein degradation . further _PROTEIN_ is directly involved in mediating the light triggered down regulation of _PROTEIN_ and the dark accumulation of _PROTEIN_ requires functional pleiotropic constitutive photomorphogenic/de etiolated/fusca proteins . our data indicate that _PROTEIN_ the proteasome and the constitutive photomorphogenic/de etiolated/fusca proteins are all involved in the light regulation of _PROTEIN_ protein abundance during arabidopsis seedling development .
to examine the endogenous _PROTEIN_ protein we raised rabbit polyclonal antibody _PROTEIN_ against a his tagged recombinant _PROTEIN_ protein . protein gel blot analysis of total protein extracts from dark grown seedlings revealed that anti _PROTEIN_ antibody is able to detect a protein band migrating at the size of around kd . this apparent size is larger than _PROTEIN_ 's predicted size of kd . nevertheless the presence of this band in wild type and the _PROTEIN_ mutant seedlings but not in the _PROTEIN_ mutant seedlings supports that it is indeed the endogenous arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ protein . it is interesting to note that _PROTEIN_ protein has a lower abundance in the dark grown _PROTEIN_ mutant than in the wild type implying a dependence of optimal _PROTEIN_ accumulation on functional _PROTEIN_ photoreceptor in darkness . with our _PROTEIN_ antibodies we examined _PROTEIN_ protein levels at different time points during arabidopsis seedling development . the _PROTEIN_ protein abundance reaches its highest level in to d old dark grown seedlings and then _PROTEIN_ rapidly . in extracts from older tissues the _PROTEIN_ protein is hardly detectable . the high abundance of _PROTEIN_ during early seedling development is consistent temporally with an important role of _PROTEIN_ in seedling photomorphogenesis and the absence of _PROTEIN_ mutant phenotype in _PROTEIN_ developmental stages . interestingly as shown in figure the _PROTEIN_ protein level is significantly reduced in light conditions . the _PROTEIN_ protein is most abundant in dark grown seedlings and its level drops about fold in fr light . in b r and white light _PROTEIN_ protein is hardly detectable . the reported _PROTEIN_ mrna level _PROTEIN_ in light conditions coincides with these _PROTEIN_ protein level changes . to examine the contribution of transcription regulation of _PROTEIN_ toward observed _PROTEIN_ abundance regulation by light and the subcellular location of this regulation we introduced cauliflower mosaic virus promoter driven full length _PROTEIN_ cdna fused with either green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ or _PROTEIN_ into the _PROTEIN_ mutant background . homozygous progeny carrying a single locus transgene from at least three independent lines were selected for further studies . the _PROTEIN_ of the fusion proteins in the transgenic lines was confirmed by protein gel blot analyses with _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ or gus antibodies with two representative lines each shown in figure . evidently both _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and gus _PROTEIN_ transgenes can rescue the _PROTEIN_ mutant phenotype in fr condition suggesting that the two _PROTEIN_ fusion proteins are functional in vivo . moreover fr grown _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ transgenic seedlings _PROTEIN_ exhibited significantly shorter hypocotyls than wild type indicating that a possible higher level of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ conferred by the strong promoter enhanced the fr responses in these transgenic plants . protein blot analysis of the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ transgenic lines shown above indicated a higher level of the fusion protein than that of the endogenous _PROTEIN_ . it is interesting to note that both _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and gus _PROTEIN_ protein levels are much higher than endogenous _PROTEIN_ protein level . however only _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ transgenic plants showed increased response to fr light . thus the gus fusion might interfere with the function of _PROTEIN_ so that the gus _PROTEIN_ protein is less active than the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ protein . the intracellular localization of _PROTEIN_ was investigated using at least three independent transgenic lines each for both _METHOD_ and gus fusion proteins . the subcellular distribution of gus _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion proteins in all lines examined exhibited essentially the same localization pattern . as shown in figure a and b gus staining or _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was detected intensely in the _LOCATION_ and also weakly in the cytoplasm . the _LOCATION_ signals were most strong in darkness and evidently reduced in all light conditions examined especially in the case of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . these results are consistent with the previous reports . although light exposure causes a _PROTEIN_ in the ratio of _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ versus cytoplasmic _PROTEIN_ this is likely due to a selective degradation of the _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ triggered by light which will be further addressed in _PROTEIN_ sections . the reported _PROTEIN_ mrna level _PROTEIN_ in light conditions coincides with these _PROTEIN_ protein level changes . to further define the specific contribution of transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulation toward _PROTEIN_ abundance by light _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion protein driven by the light insensitive promoter _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was analyzed . as shown in figure _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion protein driven by the light insensitive promoter _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ also exhibited similar light regulated abundance changes in transgenic seedlings . _METHOD_ microscopic examination revealed that the reduction of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ level is most drastic in its _LOCATION_ abundance . on the other hand due to unknown reasons the stability of gus _PROTEIN_ protein is less sensitive to light than endogenous _PROTEIN_ or _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ which resulted in better retained _LOCATION_ signals of gus _PROTEIN_ than _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in light conditions . together with previous studies our results suggest that the _PROTEIN_ protein accumulation level is the result of coordinated transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulations which is similar to the _PROTEIN_ protein . to assess the role of _PROTEIN_ in the regulation of _PROTEIN_ protein level we examined _PROTEIN_ protein levels during dark to light transitions . wild type and _PROTEIN_ mutant seedlings were grown in complete darkness for d and then treated with cfr light for and h or continuous white b and r light for min and and h . in wild type seedlings endogenous _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ rapidly after exposure to white b and r light . after just h most of the _PROTEIN_ protein had disappeared . when exposed to fr light _PROTEIN_ protein level also showed a _PROTEIN_ although less dramatic and slower than those in other light conditions . on the other hand in _PROTEIN_ mutant seedlings this reduction of the _PROTEIN_ protein was slowed down significantly in all the light conditions tested . however _PROTEIN_ was eventually degraded with extended time under all those light conditions . this result indicates that _PROTEIN_ plays a role in this light mediated _PROTEIN_ protein reduction but other photoreceptors are likely involved as well . to examine the mechanism responsible for the _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ protein upon light treatment we first tested the effect of proteasome specific inhibitors psi and alln on _PROTEIN_ protein abundance changes during the transition of d old dark grown seedlings to white light . as shown in figure each of these inhibitors was able to efficiently inhibit the _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ protein . this result indicates that the _PROTEIN_ protein is likely degraded through the proteasome pathway upon light exposure . to further assess the involvement of proteasome mediated protein degradation toward _PROTEIN_ protein abundance regulation we checked the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ protein level changes and the effect of proteasome inhibitors in the similar dark to light transitions . as the _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion protein was driven by a light insensitive promoter the contribution of possible transcriptional regulation by light toward the fusion protein should be minimal . as shown in figure the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion protein exhibited a similar degradation pattern to endogenous _PROTEIN_ during the dark to light transitions . further the degradation of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ upon light exposure can be prevented by each of the three distinct proteasome specific inhibitors . _METHOD_ microscopic examination confirmed that but not dimethyl sulfoxide _METHOD_ ethanol or cycloheximide effectively blocked _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ degradation in the _LOCATION_ . these results further confirm that the light triggered reduction of the _PROTEIN_ protein in planta is largely due to the proteasome mediated protein degradation . we further examined the role of _PROTEIN_ as well as other phytochromes in mediating light regulation of _PROTEIN_ protein abundance . as shown in figure _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ triple mutants had lower _PROTEIN_ protein levels in their dark grown seedlings compared to wild type seedlings which suggests that optimal _PROTEIN_ accumulation in darkness requires _PROTEIN_ and other phytochromes . however the fr light grown _PROTEIN_ mutants were more similar to their dark grown seedlings and exhibited higher abundance of _PROTEIN_ than both wild type and _PROTEIN_ . this result not only supports the early observation that _PROTEIN_ negatively regulates _PROTEIN_ in light but also indicates that _PROTEIN_ is the primary photoreceptor that mediates fr light dependent regulation of _PROTEIN_ protein abundance . other phytochromes such as _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ do not contribute significantly to the regulation of _PROTEIN_ abundance in fr light . the _PROTEIN_ proteins play important roles in mediating the repression of photomorphogenic development in darkness . they accomplish this by targeting photomorphogenesis promoting transcription _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ for degradation via the proteasome . to examine a possible involvement of those proteins in light regulation of _PROTEIN_ protein abundance we analyzed _PROTEIN_ protein levels in different cop/det/fus mutants . protein extracts from d old _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutants and wild type seedlings grown in both white light and dark conditions were prepared and blotted with _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ antibodies . except _PROTEIN_ which is a very weak allele of _PROTEIN_ all the cop/det/fus mutants exhibited similarly reduced _PROTEIN_ protein levels in both light and dark conditions while _PROTEIN_ protein levels were not significantly affected by the cop/det/fus mutations . this lack of effect on _PROTEIN_ protein level in the cop/det/fus mutants is similar to that of a previous study . it suggests that the accumulation of _PROTEIN_ protein in darkness requires the presence of functional _PROTEIN_ proteins . this is consistent with the cop/det/fus mutant phenotype which essentially mimics light grown seedlings when grown in darkness . by contrast the _PROTEIN_ mutant behaves like wild type in to d old seedlings and only displays very weak cop phenotype after about d growth in darkness . thus it is understandable why _PROTEIN_ protein level in the d old _PROTEIN_ mutant seedlings is similar to wild type . therefore the _PROTEIN_ proteins are essential for the dark accumulation of _PROTEIN_ but not _PROTEIN_ protein in planta .
the wild type arabidopsis used in this study were of the landsberg _LOCATION_ ecotype unless otherwise indicated . the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants have been described previously . to grow arabidopsis seedlings seeds were surface sterilized plated on murashige and skoog medium containing or suc and incubated at for to d before being placed in a standard continuous white light growth chamber at . after h of incubation plates were transferred to corresponding light conditions or complete darkness for to d. the fluence rates of the light growth chambers were for fr light for white light for r light and for b light . to obtain adult plants to d old seedlings were transferred to soil and grown in a standard long day growth room . for the experiments testing proteasome specific inhibitors and protein synthesis inhibitors alln and psi were dissolved in _METHOD_ and chx was dissolved in ethanol and arabidopsis seedlings were vacuum infiltrated with these inhibitors for min before being transferred from darkness to white light . the incubation temperature is . the full length cdna of _PROTEIN_ were amplified by reverse transcription pcr with forward primer and reverse primer and cloned into the _PROTEIN_ topo vector . this construct served as a pcr template for subsequent cloning of _PROTEIN_ into other vectors . a bamhi spei fragment containing _PROTEIN_ cdna was cloned into the bglii xbai site of the _METHOD_ and gus/nia vectors . for generating gus _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ binary constructs a hindiii fragment was subcloned from the above mentioned constructs into . the gus _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ constructs were introduced into _PROTEIN_ mutant via agrobacterium tumefaciens mediated transformation . transgenic plants were selected with gentamycin and more than independent lines for each construct were generated . at least three independent lines with single t dna locus were used for detailed molecular and biochemical analyses . four day old gus _PROTEIN_ transgenic seedlings were selected and stained as previously described . the staining time varied depending on the light condition that the seedlings were grown in . all stained seedlings were fixed for min in formaldehyde . after bleaching overnight with ethanol the seedlings were rehydrated with a graded ethanol series before being mounted on slides in mg/l diamino phenylindole and viewed under a microscope . for subcellular localization of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ protein in the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ transgenic arabidopsis d old whole seedlings were mounted on slides in mg/l dapi and viewed under a _METHOD_ microscope with _METHOD_ filter sets . representative photographs were taken using a digital camera and the figures were assembled using adobe photoshop software _METHOD_ . arabidopsis tissues were homogenized in extraction buffer a containing mm tris hcl mm nacl mm nonidet p mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and complete protease inhibitor or extraction buffer b containing mm tris hcl mm nacl mm edta mm naf mm mm glycerolphosphate glycerol tween mm dithiothreitol mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and complete protease inhibitor . the extracts were centrifuged twice at for min each and the protein concentration in the supernatant was determined by bradford assay . protein samples were boiled in sample buffer run on _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ gels and blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride _LOCATION_ . the protein blot analysis with indicated primary and secondary antibodies is essentially following previously described protocol . all protein blot analyses were repeated at least three times to ensure the reproducibility of the results presented in this article . an ecori/noti fragment containing the full length _PROTEIN_ open reading frame was cloned into pet . this construct encodes a fusion protein with his tags and _PROTEIN_ . the fusion protein was _PROTEIN_ in escherichia coli and purified with nickel nitrilotriacetic acid beads . polyclonal antibodies were raised by immunizing rabbits using purified fusion protein as antigen . the ecori/noti fragment containing _PROTEIN_ was also cloned into pgex generating a construct that encodes _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ fusion protein . the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ fusion protein was _PROTEIN_ in e. coli and purified with glutathione beads . polyclonal _PROTEIN_ antibodies were then purified using hitrap n hydroxysuccinimide activated column coupled with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . other primary antibodies used in this study include anti anti _PROTEIN_ anti _METHOD_ and anti gus .
