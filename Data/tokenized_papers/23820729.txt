the transmembrane receptor kinase family is the largest protein kinase family in arabidopsis and it contains the highest fraction of proteins with yet uncharacterized functions . here we present functions of _PROTEIN_ a receptor kinase that was previously identified with rapid transient phosphorylation after sucrose resupply to sucrose starved seedlings . _PROTEIN_ was found to be an active kinase with increasing activity in the presence of an external sucrose supply . in t dna insertional mutants the sucrose induced phosphorylation patterns of several _LOCATION_ proteins were strongly reduced in particular pore gating phosphorylation sites in aquaporins were affected . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusions were found to directly interact with aquaporins in affinity pull down experiments on microsomal _LOCATION_ vesicles . furthermore protoplast swelling assays of mutants and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ lines confirmed a direct functional interaction of receptor kinase _PROTEIN_ and aquaporins as substrates for phosphorylation . a lack of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ resulted in the failure of mutant protoplasts to control water channel activity upon changes in external sucrose concentrations . we propose that _PROTEIN_ is involved in the regulation of sucrose specific osmotic responses through direct interaction with and activation of an aquaporin via phosphorylation and that the duration of this response is controlled by phosphorylation dependent receptor internalization .
_PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ a member of the lrr receptor like kinase family showed a significant transient increase in protein phosphorylation of serine after sucrose resupply to sucrose starved cells . in order to study the role of _PROTEIN_ in sucrose induced phosphorylation processes we made use of a t dna insertional mutant . the t dna was inserted into the first intron of the _PROTEIN_ gene . homozygous mutants of were selected from a segregating population using a pcr screen with gene specific primers and t dna primers . homozygous mutants had an overall reduced _PROTEIN_ gene _PROTEIN_ . additionally no peptides of _PROTEIN_ protein were fragmented in _LOCATION_ preparations of t dna insertional mutants but ion intensities for two peptides fsdqpvmldvyspdr and neiwgdvgeiftelk were assigned based on retention time correlation . in general peptide ion intensity _METHOD_ for _PROTEIN_ in the t dna insertional mutant were at least times lower than in the wild type . for complementation of mutants the _PROTEIN_ cdna was cloned as a _METHOD_ fusion and _PROTEIN_ under the promoter resulting in higher _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ relative to the wild type . furthermore _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion constructs were made for _PROTEIN_ in which the serine was mutated to either alanine or aspartic acid to result in phosphorylation site null mutants and phosphorylation mimics . relative _PROTEIN_ levels of the phosphorylation site mutant constructs were similar to those observed for the native construct . predicted _PROTEIN_ localization to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ was confirmed by confocal imaging of the _METHOD_ fusion constructs in overlay images with _LOCATION_ staining dye . the localization of _PROTEIN_ in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ was not altered by the mutations on all three _PROTEIN_ constructs _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ localized at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and to endosomes overlapping with . _PROTEIN_ and the phosphorylation site mutants showed kinase activity when exposed to a generic substrate such as myelin basic protein as recorded by reduced luminescence in a luciferase dependent measurement of residual _PROTEIN_ in the assay . the kinase activity of _PROTEIN_ isolated from microsomal fractions of seedlings _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ construct was significantly increased upon sucrose resupply after sucrose starvation . in contrast for mutants _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ only kinase activity in sucrose starved and sucrose resupplied seedlings remained unaltered . in general kinase activity in plants _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ only was significantly lower even relative to sucrose starved plants _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or the site directed mutant constructs _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . mutation of the _PROTEIN_ phosphorylation site at serine to alanine resulted in kinase activity similar to that of sucrose starved _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ plants and kinase activity did not significantly increase upon sucrose exposure . in contrast when serine was mutated to aspartic acid subsequent kinase activity was more similar to that of the sucrose induced _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ plants and remained higher under sucrose starvation . in all cases although _PROTEIN_ protein was isolated from different plant lines the amount of _PROTEIN_ protein present in the assay was not significantly different for different constructs . in order to study the role of _PROTEIN_ in the context of rapid alterations in external sucrose availability a sucrose starvation and resupply experiment was carried out with seedlings of wild type and mutant . sucrose was resupplied to _PROTEIN_ starved seedlings to a final concentration of mm for min . this was the time point at which maximal transient phosphorylation of _PROTEIN_ had been observed in previous work . in total phosphopeptides were identified in at least one genotype or condition . spectra for all identified phosphopeptides were submitted to the phosphorylation site database phosphat and also can be found in supplemental fig . . from these phosphopeptides were quantified in wild type both in starved seedlings and after min of sucrose resupply for the mutant phosphopeptides were quantified under both conditions . this resulted in an overlapping phosphorylation sites with quantitative information for both time points in wild type and mutant seedlings . to identify significant alterations in sucrose induced phosphorylation between the wild type and the mutant the variation in sucrose induced phosphorylation as calculated from phosphopeptide ion intensity ratios of the sucrose induced state relative to the sucrose starved state was analyzed within the replicates of each plant line . in contrast comparison of the sucrose induced phosphorylation ratios between and col revealed a significantly different distribution of sucrose induced phosphorylation . particularly for in comparison to wild type the distribution of sucrose induced phosphorylation ratios _PROTEIN_ was shifted to lower ratios suggesting that protein phosphorylation in did not increase in response to the sucrose stimulus to the same degree as in wild type col . in detail about of all quantified phosphopeptides showed an altered abundance in mutant relative to the wild type with phosphopeptides displaying at least fold lower sucrose induced phosphorylation and phosphopeptides showing at least fold higher sucrose induced phosphorylation relative to the wild type . we could confirm the sucrose induced phosphorylation of the _PROTEIN_ peptide fsdqpv _PROTEIN_ pdr bearing . sucrose induced phosphorylation of this peptide was abolished in mutant and partially restored in the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ overexpression line . in general proteins with transport functions _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were overrepresented among phosphopeptides with reduced sucrose induced phosphorylation in followed by proteins with functions in protein synthesis . peptides of transport related proteins were the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ the sucrose exporter _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ the _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ exporter _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ and particularly peptides originating from the c terminal end of different aquaporins _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . for signaling proteins the sucrose induced phosphorylation of protein kinase _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ phosphopeptide ifv nsakr was found to be reduced in . other signaling proteins with reduced phosphorylation in included _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ the rab protein _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and a remorin family protein _PROTEIN_ . furthermore for seven ribosomal proteins and one translation initiation _PROTEIN_ protein phosphorylation in response to external sucrose was reduced in . for another proteins _PROTEIN_ overexpressing lines showed increased sucrose induced phosphorylation that remained unaltered in . for example the sucrose induced phosphorylation of nslni mr of kinase _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was only slightly reduced in but it showed a higher phosphorylation state in _PROTEIN_ overexpressing lines than in wild type seedlings after sucrose induced phosphorylation . the phosphopeptides identified with reduced sucrose induced phosphorylation contained two significant phosphorylation motifs an es motif that was _PROTEIN_ found in the ribosomal proteins and an sxrs motif that particularly contained the double phosphorylation sites of the aquaporin peptides . a search for the sxrs motif in the phosphat database revealed a total of phosphopeptide sequences and phosphorylation was shown for of these for both serine residues . the sxrs motif thus _METHOD_ to be a double phosphorylation site motif and possibly the same kinase can address both sites . for proteins higher sucrose induced phosphorylation was observed in the t dna insertional mutant . among them we found enzymes of central _PROTEIN_ and nitrogen metabolism such as sucrose phosphate synthase _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ an isoform of _LOCATION_ glutamine synthase _PROTEIN_ glutamate decarboxylase _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and asparagine synthase _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . the phosphorylation site in peptide in aesmelwasqqk of sucrose phosphate synthase _PROTEIN_ was found to be the major regulatory phosphorylation site leading to inactivation of the enzyme in phosphorylated status . observations of levels of sucrose induced phosphorylation of these proteins higher than found in the wild type might point to the involvement of additional proteins such as protein kinases or phosphatases that are inactivated or activated by _PROTEIN_ . for phosphopeptides of the proteins with _PROTEIN_ phosphorylation in a trend or significant increase of sucrose induced phosphorylation was observed in the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ overexpression line relative to the mutant . for most of these phosphopeptides sucrose induced phosphorylation reached levels similar to those in wild type plants . the major apparent phosphorylation targets of _PROTEIN_ namely aquaporin proteins were confirmed by an in vitro phosphorylation assay involving synthetic peptides . an in vitro kinase assay was performed using a mixture of different peptides as a substrate . the peptide mixture contained a total of peptides matching various experimentally confirmed phosphorylation sites including the c terminal peptide algsfgsfgsfr of aquaporin _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ lgtvsspepisvvr from _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and peptide lieevshssgspnpvsd of receptor kinase _PROTEIN_ . in addition control peptides were included one for each of the putative substrate proteins . after exposure to _PROTEIN_ only peptides algsfgsfgsfr lgtvsspepisvvr and lieevshssgspnpvsd were found to be phosphorylated whereas other peptides with experimentally confirmed phosphorylation sites were detected in the non phosphorylated form . for peptide algsfgsfgsfr the singly phosphorylated versions algsfg _PROTEIN_ and algsfgsfg fr and the doubly phosphorylated version algsfg _PROTEIN_ fr were detected . quantitative analysis of the _PROTEIN_ phosphopeptides revealed increased phosphorylation of peptide algsfgsfgsfr at two different phosphorylation sites upon exposure to the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ constructs relative to _METHOD_ only purifications . the phosphorylation of _PROTEIN_ substrate peptide was independent of phosphorylation site mutagenesis . the control peptide for _PROTEIN_ with no phosphorylation sites did not show altered ion intensity levels after exposure to the _PROTEIN_ variants . altogether putative target peptides and control peptides were not detected in the _METHOD_ spectrometric analysis after in vitro kinase exposure . for technical reasons the peptide algsfgsfgsfr was the only c terminal aquaporin peptide included in the in vitro assay related peptides slgsfr aanv _PROTEIN_ algsfr natn _PROTEIN_ and qlhelha _PROTEIN_ were not tested in this context . we were interested in sucrose induced protein protein interaction partners of _PROTEIN_ . therefore _METHOD_ pull downs under sucrose starvation conditions and under sucrose resupplied conditions were performed with seedlings _PROTEIN_ the different _PROTEIN_ fusion proteins or _METHOD_ only . under each sucrose treatment condition protein ion intensity _METHOD_ of interaction partners for each of the bait _METHOD_ fusions _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were _PROTEIN_ relative to the interaction partners of the _METHOD_ only control under that condition . results from three biological replicates were averaged and significant interaction partners were defined after pairwise t test and multiple testing correction . the full list of all identified proteins in the pull down experiments of the different bait protein versions is available as supplemental table and the full results of pairwise t tests of bait versus _METHOD_ only samples including corrected and uncorrected p values are available as supplemental table . in pull downs with _PROTEIN_ bait proteins under sucrose induced conditions two to three times more proteins were identified as significant interaction partners than in the sucrose starved condition although _PROTEIN_ bait was present in similar amounts . a large overlap in identified proteins was observed for the three _PROTEIN_ constructs _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ with a tendency for stronger overlap between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ than between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . among the significant interaction partners were also numerous ribosomal proteins and proteins with _LOCATION_ locations . these protein classes are known to be particularly sticky and often occur as nonspecific interactors in pull downs . therefore only proteins with _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ or _LOCATION_ locations based on the consensus location from _PROTEIN_ were considered . a total of proteins remained as significant sucrose induced interaction partners for all _PROTEIN_ constructs . among these common interactors we found a strong overrepresentation of aquaporins particularly _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . other significant interaction partners to _PROTEIN_ and its site directed mutants were a number of protein kinases such as three transmembrane receptor like protein kinases as well as two kinases from the bsk family . the bsk kinases were shown to be involved in the brassinosteroid signaling pathway initiated by receptor kinase _PROTEIN_ . other significant interaction partners to _PROTEIN_ were clathrins _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and a coatomer subunit protein _PROTEIN_ indicating connections to endocytotic pathways . interestingly members of the remorin family of proteins were identified exclusively under sucrose resupplied conditions with more than fold enrichment in the different _PROTEIN_ pull downs relative to _METHOD_ only . remorins are proteins with clear preferable location in sterol rich _LOCATION_ microdomains . in the phosphopeptide profiling experiment comparing sucrose induced phosphorylation of wild type and several phosphopeptides matching the c terminal end of aquaporins were identified and aquaporins were found as interaction partners of _PROTEIN_ . thus we hypothesized that _PROTEIN_ either independently or within a complex of interacting proteins may be involved in the regulation of aquaporin activity particularly given that aquaporins are known to be regulated by protein phosphorylation . the identified differentially phosphorylated sites in wild type and mutant samples at the c terminus of aquaporins are conserved in the aquaporin protein family and are responsible for pore gating . full phosphorylation at the two serine residues will lead to pore opening whereas dephosphorylated serine residues result in a closed pore . therefore the water transport capacity of wild type mutant and the different lines _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and mutants were analyzed in a protoplast swelling assay reflecting the aquaporin activity . when exposed to a hypo osmolar medium protoplasts take up water through aquaporins this can be observed in the swelling of the protoplasts . protoplasts were prepared from sucrose starved seedlings and initially exposed to mm mannitol . then the protoplasts were _PROTEIN_ either with mm mannitol or with mm mannitol containing mm sucrose . the water flux density across the protoplast _LOCATION_ was calculated from video records of individual protoplasts . in the wild type sucrose containing medium induced a higher swelling rate than mannitol medium alone . this was completely abolished in the mutant which showed significantly less swelling upon sucrose treatment than upon mannitol treatment . in the complementation line _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ the significant increase in water flux density upon sucrose treatment was restored . the higher water flux density in the complementation line than in the wild type sucrose induced protoplasts might be due to overexpression of _PROTEIN_ under the promoter . there were no significant differences in water flux densities among wild type and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ lines when treated with mannitol only . the mutation of to alanine or aspartic acid did not result in a significantly different water flux density in mannitol medium . protoplasts from the two site directed mutant lines also showed increases in water flux densities similar to those in plants _PROTEIN_ wild type _PROTEIN_ . in general the mutants of _PROTEIN_ were still able to phosphorylate aquaporins indicating that mutations at did not affect kinase activity . in order to gain insights into the role of serine phosphorylation sites in sucrose related responses we also performed sucrose starvation experiments followed by min of sucrose resupply using the mutants _PROTEIN_ either or mutants of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . we assumed that an aspartic acid substitution mimics a constitutive phosphorylation of ser and that alanine produces a phosphorylation null mutation . there was a slight trend for the plants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ showing more wild type like sucrose induced phosphorylation of aquaporin _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or other proteins such as tonoplast located _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ . this trend was supported by our findings of slightly higher kinase activity in _PROTEIN_ than in _PROTEIN_ . the results from _PROTEIN_ pull downs indicated significant interaction partners as more frequent interactors to _PROTEIN_ than to _PROTEIN_ based on pairwise significance testing of abundance ratios relative to the _METHOD_ only control . among these proteins were fasciclin like arabinogalactan proteins _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ synamptogamin a _PROTEIN_ a ubiquitin conjugating enzyme _PROTEIN_ and a phospholipase d _PROTEIN_ . among the proteins found as common interaction partners to _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ we found four members of the thioredoxin family _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ six proteins _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ six proteins with functions in g protein signaling _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and seven _METHOD_ of tubulin _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . among the _LOCATION_ located interaction partners to _PROTEIN_ synaptogamin a _PROTEIN_ sugar transporter _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were found with abundance ratios that were higher in the sucrose supplied status . in contrast proteins with _LOCATION_ or external locations were identified as significant interaction partners to _PROTEIN_ independent of the sucrose status . this constituted of all identified _LOCATION_ located significant interaction partners of _PROTEIN_ . among these sucrose independent interactors were aquaporin _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ as well as proteins with functions in _LOCATION_ trafficking cell wall or _LOCATION_ microdomains _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and three clathrins _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ related to phosphoinosite signaling _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ belonged to the mapman category myrosinases lectin jacalin. all of these proteins were also identified as significant interaction partners to _PROTEIN_ with a non mutated phosphorylation site but only in the sucrose induced state . these findings might be indicative of a role of phosphorylation in either protein targeting or sucrose induced internalization of _PROTEIN_ . because interactions with proteins with functions in receptor internalization or trafficking were found to be stronger in the mutant we propose that phosphorylation at might be one way to induce the rapid internalization of _PROTEIN_ and thus lead to adjustment of receptor availability during or after stimulation . a role of phosphorylation in connection with receptor internalization was confirmed through the observation of _PROTEIN_ accumulation in sucrose induced endocytotic events . clearly sucrose stimulation for up to min induced the formation of endosome like structures containing _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ overexpressing plants . if was mutated to a phosphorylation null mimic the frequency of _PROTEIN_ endocytosis was significantly reduced as shown by the less frequent observation of cells with many sucrose induced _PROTEIN_ containing endocytotic vesicles . in contrast if was mutated to a constitutive phosphorylation mimic the number of cells with few _PROTEIN_ containing endocytotic events in the absence of sucrose was strongly increased . interestingly in this mutant the number of cells with many _PROTEIN_ containing endocytotic events under non induced conditions was slightly higher than observed in the wild type version . interestingly the mutant did not respond to sucrose resupply . thus some degree of phosphorylation at resulted in increased _PROTEIN_ endocytosis relative to the non phosphorylated condition .
a t dna insertional mutant for was identified within the salk t dna insertional lines collection . seeds of t dna insertional mutant were obtained from the nottingham arabidopsis stock centre and propagated in the greenhouse at the max planck institute for molecular plant physiology . the t dna insertional mutant carries a t dna insertion in the first intron of _PROTEIN_ and was confirmed via pcr amplification using t dna border primer _PROTEIN_ and gene specific primer _PROTEIN_ rp _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in the wild type and mutant was examined by using a pair of gene specific primers _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . total rna was extracted from the plants using the plant rna mini kit according to the instructions provided by the manufacturer . rna was digested with dnasei to remove the genomic dna . first strand cdna was synthesized using superscript iii reverse transcriptase . quantitative real time pcr analysis was performed using the steponeplus real time pcr system _METHOD_ with the sybr green detection protocol _METHOD_ . the ubq gene was used as an internal control and the relative _PROTEIN_ of the gene of interest was calculated using a comparative ct method . primers for _PROTEIN_ were designed for the n terminal part and the c terminal part of the gene tttcgaggttcacgtgcaag _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ cgacacattgaatcccaccatt . primers used for ubiquitin were ggccttgtataatccctgatgaataag and aaagagataacaggaacggaaacatagt . full length cdna of the _PROTEIN_ gene without a stop code was amplified via pcr using the specific forward primer _PROTEIN_ ecori and the specific reverse primer smai . it was then subcloned into the pgem t easy vector . the ecori _PROTEIN_ smai fragment was then cloned into the plant transformation vector pezr ln upstream and as a fusion of the _METHOD_ coding sequence resulting in the plasmid _METHOD_ . the construct pgem t easy ecori _PROTEIN_ smai was used for mutating ser of to ala or asp . site directed mutagenesis was done via pcr using specific primer pairs _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and the quikchange ii site directed mutagenesis kit . the ecori smai fragment or ecori _PROTEIN_ smai fragment also was cloned into plant transformation vector pezr ln and as a fusion with the _METHOD_ coding sequence resulting in the plasmid _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ . three plasmids were transferred into agrobacterium tumefaciens strain and mutant plants were transformed using the floral dip method . homozygous transgenic lines were further selected by means of segregation analysis and seeds were used for experiments . the _METHOD_ of _METHOD_ in the transgenic lines was checked via confocal laser scanning microscopy _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . arabidopsis seedlings of wild type _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ were germinated and grown under continuous light in jouanneau and medium composed of micro and macronutrients with a total of mm nitrogen and supplemented with sucrose . after days we sucrose starved the seedlings by changing the growth medium to a sucrose free medium and leaving the flasks in the dark for h as described elsewhere . sucrose was then resupplied to a final concentration of mm for min before seedlings were harvested for microsomal protein preparation . in a control experiment mm mannitol was used instead of sucrose . a total of g of seedlings was homogenized in a falcon tube with ml extraction buffer _METHOD_ in the presence of v/v proteinase inhibitor mixture and phosphatase inhibitors . the homogenate was centrifuged for min at g at . the pellet was discarded and the supernatant was ultracentrifuged for h at g at . the microsomal pellet was re suspended in of _LOCATION_ buffer . the soluble fraction in the supernatant was precipitated with three times volume acetone overnight and then proteins were resuspended in m urea m thiourea ph . microsomal proteins isolated as described above were incubated with of anti _METHOD_ magnetic beads for two hours on a rotating wheel at . after incubation the beads were collected on a separator and washed two times with and wash buffer . for protein protein interaction assays the proteins were eluted from the beads

. _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein was affinity purified over magnetic beads . a luciferase based kinase activity assay was performed in reaction mixture incubated for one hour at room temperature . the reaction mixture contained to beads with _METHOD_ tagged proteins myelin basic protein as a generic kinase substrate of _PROTEIN_ and an appropriate reaction buffer . after incubation kinase plus reagents were added and incubated for min . luminescence as a measure of _PROTEIN_ consumption was recorded with a luminometer . in general protein isolations from three independent batches of seedlings were tested and the average activity value plus/minus the standard deviation is presented . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein was affinity purified over magnetic beads . a luciferase based kinase activity assay was performed as described above except that of a mixture of putative target peptides was used as a substrate . the peptide mixture consisted of peptides bearing experimentally confirmed phosphorylation sites to different proteins _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _GENE_ as well as control peptides without known phosphorylation sites _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _GENE_ . in total the peptides were exposed as a substrate to the enriched _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusions enriched in microsomal fractions of three independent protein isolations . after exposure to the target peptides the reaction mixture was purified over material to trap undigested _PROTEIN_ protein and to collect the respective target peptides . collected peptide mixtures were then desalted over prior to _METHOD_ spectrometric analysis . the phosphorylation of target peptides was confirmed via _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . arabidopsis seedlings were grown in liquid cultures and sucrose starved as described above but not _PROTEIN_ with sucrose . instead parts of the day old seedlings were carefully dried on tissue paper washed with a filter sterilized mm mannitol mm solution and cut into small pieces that were finally transferred to ml enzymatic digestion medium mm mm kcl plus cellulase onozuka _PROTEIN_ and macerozyme _PROTEIN_ . the protoplasts were prepared in the dark with gentle shaking for two to three hours filtered through a nylon filter centrifuged at g at for min and washed three times with ice cold es m without enzymes . protoplasts were stored in the dark on ice for at least min before an experiment was started . in principle protoplast swelling experiments were performed as described previously with some modifications . approximately of the protoplast suspension were pipetted into es m in a perfusion chamber mounted on the stage of an inverted microscope . protoplasts were allowed to settle down for about to min . the chamber was then perfused with ml of es m to select protoplasts sticking well to the glass bottom of the chamber . the perfusion solution was then changed to a hypo osmolar solution containing the same ingredients as es m but with mm mannitol instead of mm mannitol . the solution change in the chamber lasted about s. images were taken every s with a video camera equipped microscope for a total of s. in some experiments protoplasts were treated with mm sucrose . for this the chamber was perfused with a solution containing mm sucrose and mm mannitol for about min mm mm kcl and then _PROTEIN_ with a hypo osmolar solution consisting of mm mannitol and mm sucrose mm mm kcl . the osmolality of all media was measured with a cryoscopic osmometer and the following osmolalities were noted es osmol es osmol es osmol es osmol . the diameter of the protoplasts was measured using imagej software . diameters were converted to micrometers and the volume surface area and relative volume were calculated for each time point . a regression line was fitted to the steepest part of the swelling curve to determine the maximal water volume flux density which corresponds to aquaporin activity . statistical analysis was performed with sigma plot . seedlings _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were imaged on a confocal microscope equipped with a csu yokogawa spinning disc head fitted to a nikon ti e inverted microscope a _PROTEIN_ apo water immersion objective an evolve charge coupled device camera and a lens between the spinning disc and the camera . _METHOD_ was excited at nm and at nm using a multichannel dichroic and an m or m band pass emission filter for _METHOD_ and red _METHOD_ protein respectively . image acquisitions were performed using metamorph online premier version . typical exposure times were _METHOD_ for _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ for red _METHOD_ protein . four day old seedlings grown in the dark in half strength _METHOD_ liquid medium were incubated in half strength _METHOD_ liquid medium supplemented with _METHOD_ for min . they were washed three times for min in half strength _METHOD_ liquid medium . the treatments were performed in the dark under slight agitation . the quantification of endocytotic events was performed for seedlings _METHOD_ not incubated in in order to avoid any alteration of the sugar perception produced by the lipophilic dye . the three _PROTEIN_ constructs _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were imaged directly after growth under sucrose starvation conditions or after to min of sucrose resupply . per treatment and genotype at least eight seedlings and hypocotyl cells/seedling were counted starting from the bottom part of the hypocotyl . the cells were classified according to the amount of endocytotic events detectable few or many described elsewhere . all images were processed using imagej software . background correction was performed using the subtract background tool . microsomal or

phosphopeptides were eluted from beads in these microcolumns using ammonium hydroxide and piperidine . elutes were immediately acidified by adding phosphoric acid to reach a ph value less than . enriched phosphopeptides were desalted over a stage tip again prior to _METHOD_ spectrometric analysis . tryptic peptide mixtures were analyzed via lc _METHOD_ using nanoflow easy nlc as an hplc

to five data dependent _METHOD_ spectra were acquired in the linear ion trap for each full scan spectrum acquired at full width half maximum resolution in the orbitrap . the overall cycle time was approximately s. when analyzing samples after phosphopeptide enrichments multistage activation was chosen for fragmentation to achieve the simultaneous fragmentation of parent ion and neutral loss peaks of phosphopeptides . protein identification and ion intensity quantitation were carried out by maxquant version . spectra were matched against the arabidopsis proteome using andromeda . common contaminants were included during database searches . _PROTEIN_ of cysteine was set as a fixed modification and the oxidation of methionine and phosphorylation of serine threonine and tyrosine were

phosphopeptides and proteotypic non phosphopeptides were used for quantitation . within each sample ion intensities of each peptide ions species were normalized against the total ion intensities in that sample . subsequently each peptide ion species was scaled against the average normalized intensity of that ion across all treatments . for each peptide values from three biological replicates were averaged after normalization and scaling . in the case of non phosphopeptides protein ion intensity _METHOD_ were calculated from normalized scaled ion intensities of all proteotypic peptides . sucrose induced phosphorylation was _PROTEIN_ as the ratio of normalized and scaled phosphopeptide ion intensity values at min of sucrose resupply to the normalized and scaled phosphopeptide ion intensity values from the sucrose starved control . for estimation of the sample to sample variation of sucrose induced phosphorylation within each plant line distributions of sucrose induced phosphorylation ratios were compared within col within and between as described previously . differences between the ratio distributions were assessed via a kolmogorov smirnov test using the software r. for the analysis of pull down results protein ion intensity values from three biological replicates in samples of bait pull down and _METHOD_ only pull down were compared by means of a pairwise t test and multiple testing correction was applied . for pull downs under sucrose induced conditions _METHOD_ only pull downs under sucrose induced conditions were used as a control and for the sucrose starvation condition _METHOD_ only pull downs under sucrose starvation conditions were used as reference . functional classification of proteins was done based on mapman . information about subcellular location was derived from the consensus location available from _PROTEIN_ . for data not derived from _METHOD_ _METHOD_ studies statistical analyses were carried out using sigma plot and
