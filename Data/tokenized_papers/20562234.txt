auxin is an essential phytohormone that regulates many aspects of plant development . to identify new genes that function in auxin signaling we performed a genetic screen for arabidopsis thaliana mutants with an alteration in the _PROTEIN_ of the auxin responsive reporter _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . one of the mutants recovered in this screen called weak auxin _PROTEIN_ has a defect in auxin response and exhibits a variety of auxin related growth defects in the root . _PROTEIN_ auxin transport is reduced in _PROTEIN_ seedlings resulting in auxin accumulation in the hypocotyl and cotyledons and a reduction in auxin levels in the root apex . in addition the levels of the _PROTEIN_ auxin transport proteins are reduced in the _PROTEIN_ root . we also show that _PROTEIN_ is root uv b _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ a member of the broadly conserved _PROTEIN_ domain protein family found in diverse eukaryotic _METHOD_ . our data indicate that _PROTEIN_ is required for auxin transport and to _PROTEIN_ the normal levels of _PROTEIN_ proteins in the root .
to discover new genes involved in auxin signaling we mutagenized seeds carrying the auxin responsive reporter _METHOD_ with ethyl methanesulfonate and screened plants on medium containing nm d. five day old seedlings with reduced _METHOD_ signal in the root were identified and transferred to medium without auxin for further analysis . eight single gene recessive mutants were ultimately recovered called wxr mutants . the _PROTEIN_ mutant displays severe defects in root development and slight defects in leaf and inflorescence development . to characterize the _PROTEIN_ phenotype in more detail plants were backcrossed to columbia _METHOD_ plants three times . when d old seedlings were placed on nm d medium for h wild type plants carrying _METHOD_ display an increase in _METHOD_ signal in the root tip whereas _PROTEIN_ plants do not exhibit an obvious change . a similar result was obtained when _PROTEIN_ plants were tested on medium containing iaa or napthalene acetic acid . when grown using our typical growth conditions the young _PROTEIN_ seedlings accumulate anthocyanin in the cotyledons and hypocotyls and primary root elongation is dramatically reduced . the roots of wild type seedlings were cm after d on _PROTEIN_ medium whereas _PROTEIN_ roots were only cm . furthermore root hairs on mutant seedlings initiate but do not elongate . lugol staining revealed that d old mutant roots had fewer columella cells than did wild type roots and that those cells were disorganized . the cell pattern was irregular in the _PROTEIN_ root tip and the meristem region was much smaller . five day old wild type plants had meristem cortex cells whereas _PROTEIN_ plants had meristem cortex cells . the rosette leaves of week old _PROTEIN_ mutants were smaller than those of wild type plants and at weeks mutant plants displayed a slight _PROTEIN_ in apical dominance . shoot number including primary and axillary shoots was in _PROTEIN_ and in wild type plants . these data indicate that the _PROTEIN_ mutation affects _PROTEIN_ root growth and has a smaller effect on development of the rosette and inflorescence . during the course of our studies we found that _PROTEIN_ plants are hypersensitive to both light and temperature . when grown at the elevated temperature of in white light the meristem cortex cell number of _PROTEIN_ plants did not change but primary root elongation increased dramatically . when _PROTEIN_ plants were grown at lower light levels both primary root length and meristem cell number were increased relative to the wild type . to determine if this effect was specific for yellow light we also grew seedlings in low levels of far red red and blue light as well as in dark conditions . in each case the effect of _PROTEIN_ on root growth was reduced relative to that in high levels of white light indicating that _PROTEIN_ roots were responding to reduced light intensity rather than to a specific wavelength . in yellow light and high temperature _PROTEIN_ root elongation was further stimulated . high temperature has been shown to cause an increase in auxin levels in seedlings and light affects both local auxin levels as well as auxin transport . thus it is possible that increased temperature and reduced light result in increased levels of endogenous auxin and that this change partially restores root growth . to investigate this possibility we used the _METHOD_ reporter . surprisingly we found that _METHOD_ levels were _PROTEIN_ in both wild type and _PROTEIN_ roots grown at low light . however _METHOD_ levels were increased at elevated temperature in both genotypes . furthermore this increase was even more dramatic in roots grown in low light and high temperature suggesting a synergism between these two environmental conditions . since primary root elongation is reduced so dramatically under our standard light conditions it was difficult to measure changes in primary root length in _PROTEIN_ . as an alternative we analyzed root growth under yellow light . the results in figures and show that _PROTEIN_ seedlings have reduced responses to iaa and gravity consistent with a defect in auxin response . to characterize further the gravitropic defect we also constructed double mutants with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . each of these mutants is affected in gravitropism due to a defect in auxin signaling or transport . the double mutants were all more severely affected than were the corresponding single mutants . to examine the function of _PROTEIN_ in auxin signaling we introduced _PROTEIN_ into _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutants defective in auxin perception . the seedling roots of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were similar to those of wild type plants except that they had fewer _PROTEIN_ roots . by contrast of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ seedlings did not develop a root and died on the plates . similarly introduction of _PROTEIN_ into _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ had a dramatic effect on seedling phenotype . greater than of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ survived beyond the seedling stage whereas < of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ seedlings survived and these had much more severely affected primary roots than those of _PROTEIN_ . the rosettes of week old _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plants had extremely small rosette leaves compared with those of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ plants and exhibited an early yellowing phenotype . the inflorescences of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were also very small whereas those of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were similar to those of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plants after flowering . these results confirm that _PROTEIN_ is deficient in auxin related processes . to investigate further the effects of _PROTEIN_ on auxin response the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ gus _PROTEIN_ transgene was introduced into _PROTEIN_ mutant plants . _PROTEIN_ gus is a substrate for and provides a useful tool to assess function in the plant . seven day old wild type and _PROTEIN_ seedlings carrying the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ gus construct were heat shocked for h at in the dark . seedlings were transferred to plates with or without iaa at and stained for gus at time intervals . the roots of _PROTEIN_ seedlings accumulated much more _PROTEIN_ gus than did those of wild type plants following heat shock . however upon auxin treatment gus staining rapidly _PROTEIN_ in both wild type and mutant roots . measurement of gus activity by _METHOD_ galactosidase methylumbelliferylglucuronide assay showed that _PROTEIN_ gus was degraded at a similar rate in both wild type and _PROTEIN_ plants . these results indicate that the auxin resistant aspects of the _PROTEIN_ phenotype can not be explained by a reduction in dependent degradation of aux/iaa proteins . however _PROTEIN_ gus accumulation was reduced in the cotyledons and hypocotyls of _PROTEIN_ plants compared with the wild type suggesting that degradation of the protein was accelerated in the aerial parts of the _PROTEIN_ mutant . to explore how auxin distribution is affected in the _PROTEIN_ mutants gus a sensitive auxin responsive reporter was introduced into _PROTEIN_ plants . as for the _METHOD_ reporter gus staining was weaker in auxin treated mutant roots compared with the wild type . by contrast gus staining was stronger in the leaves and hypocotyls of _PROTEIN_ plants than in those of the wild type . one interpretation of these results is that _PROTEIN_ affects transport of iaa from sites of production in the shoot to the root . to assess this possibility we directly measured free iaa levels in aerial tissues of wild type and mutant seedlings . the results show that iaa levels are increased in the mutant compared with the wild type . to test our hypothesis that the _PROTEIN_ mutant is deficient in auxin transport we directly measured transport in seedlings using iaa . the results in figure show that transport of applied iaa out of the hypocotyl into the root is reduced in _PROTEIN_ plants . in addition we found a reduction in accumulation of iaa in the root tip . together these results indicate that _PROTEIN_ interferes with iaa distribution in the arabidopsis seedling by reducing auxin transport . auxin efflux carriers of the _PROTEIN_ family and the auxin influx carrier _PROTEIN_ both contribute to _PROTEIN_ auxin transport . because _PROTEIN_ plants are deficient in auxin transport we next examined the levels and distribution of several _PROTEIN_ proteins and _PROTEIN_ in the mutant . localization of _PROTEIN_ using a _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ line revealed slightly reduced _PROTEIN_ levels in the _PROTEIN_ background . by contrast in situ immunodetection using anti _PROTEIN_ and anti _PROTEIN_ antisera revealed that the levels of these two proteins were dramatically _PROTEIN_ in to d old _PROTEIN_ roots compared with the wild type . to examine _PROTEIN_ levels we introduced _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ into _PROTEIN_ plants . as for the other _PROTEIN_ proteins the level of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was clearly reduced in d old _PROTEIN_ root tips . to determine if these differences reflect changes in transcription the transcript levels of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were examined in d old _PROTEIN_ seedlings by quantitative rt pcr . the results indicate that transcript levels are similar in col and _PROTEIN_ plants suggesting that the effect on protein level is posttranscriptional . to determine if _PROTEIN_ has a specific effect on proteins involved in auxin transport we crossed transgenes _PROTEIN_ the marker proteins vha _METHOD_ _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ into mutant plants . surprisingly the levels of these proteins were also reduced in _PROTEIN_ indicating that the effects of the mutation are not specific to auxin transport proteins . by contrast the levels of the tonoplast marker vac yb was increased in _PROTEIN_ roots . if the _PROTEIN_ phenotype is related to reduced _PROTEIN_ levels it is possible that more _PROTEIN_ protein may partially suppress the phenotype . to test this possibility we crossed _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ into _PROTEIN_ plants . plants homozygous for these transgenes carrying four copies of the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ genes respectively displayed increased root elongation compared with _PROTEIN_ indicating partial rescue of the mutant phenotype . in addition the root hairs of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were nearly the same as those of the wild type . to map the _PROTEIN_ mutation genomic dna was isolated from plants generated in a cross of _PROTEIN_ with landsberg _LOCATION_ . homozygous _PROTEIN_ plants were identified based on the short root phenotype . the _PROTEIN_ mutation was first mapped between simple sequence length polymorphism markers _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . additional fine mapping placed the mutation in a kb region containing genes . the coding regions of all genes were sequenced . a single mutation was found in _GENE_ that results in the substitution of ser with leu . _GENE_ is identical to the previously identified _PROTEIN_ gene implicated in response to uv light . ser is located in a highly conserved motif tqxll present in most members of this family . _PROTEIN_ protein family members are encoded by most of the eukaryotic genomes sequenced to date . phylogenetic analysis indicates that several subfamilies diverged very early in eukaryotic evolution but different eukaryotic lineages exhibit different propensities to retain members of the different _PROTEIN_ clades . whereas plants and red algae have retained multiple lineages of _PROTEIN_ proteins most animals and fungi have only retained a single _PROTEIN_ protein and several species including yeasts and nematodes lack _PROTEIN_ proteins . thus _PROTEIN_ proteins are probably involved in a process common to most but not all eukaryotes . the _GENE_ cdna was isolated by rt pcr and used to generate c terminal _METHOD_ and gus fusions under control of the cauliflower mosaic virus promoter or the _PROTEIN_ promoter and introduced into _PROTEIN_ plants . two _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ four _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and eight _PROTEIN_ gus transgenic lines were analyzed . root growth was partially restored in each line . however the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ proteins were much more effective in rescuing the mutant phenotype than the _PROTEIN_ gus line perhaps because of the large size of the gus protein . overall these results confirm that _GENE_ is _PROTEIN_ . to analyze _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ gene we generated a _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ gus construct in which the same _PROTEIN_ genomic dna sequence of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was fused in frame with the gus reporter gene and introduced into _PROTEIN_ plants . gus staining revealed that the transgene is active in most plant organs including cotyledons hypocotyls roots _METHOD_ flowers and leaves . in particular root tips vascular tissues of all organs and _PROTEIN_ root primordia showed strong gus staining . strong staining was also observed in root pericycle cells and _PROTEIN_ root primorda suggesting that _PROTEIN_ may play a role in _PROTEIN_ root initiation perhaps through its effects on auxin transport . several proteomic studies suggest that _PROTEIN_ is localized to the chloroplast envelope . to investigate this possibility further we introduced _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ into _PROTEIN_ as well as into col plants _PROTEIN_ pt rb and px rb proteins mcherry based markers for the _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ respectively . the data in figures and show that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ colocalizes with pt rb but not px rb indicating that _PROTEIN_ is localized to the _LOCATION_ . the distribution of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was also examined in hypocotyls and young rosette leaves . in this case chloroplasts were visualized by autoflorescence . in both tissues _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ is associated with the chloroplast confirming that the protein is _LOCATION_ localized . previous studies of the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants suggested that the mutant phenotype is primarily the result of hypersensitivity to very low fluence rate uv b . to explore this possibility further with the _PROTEIN_ mutant we examined the response of seedlings to various growth conditions . to test the effects of uv light on root growth we compared seedlings grown in dark conditions white light or white light passing through a uv filter that removes essentially all uv b . our results show that dark conditions increase root growth in _PROTEIN_ seedlings but do not restore it to wild type levels . by contrast the removal of uv b light resulted in only a modest stimulation of root growth in both wild type and _PROTEIN_ seedlings . these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ other than uv light contribute to the _PROTEIN_ phenotype .
