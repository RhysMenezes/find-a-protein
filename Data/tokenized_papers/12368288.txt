the large majority of _LOCATION_ proteins are _LOCATION_ encoded and thus must be imported within these organelles . unlike most of the outer envelope proteins targeting of proteins to all other _LOCATION_ compartments _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ is strictly dependent on the presence of a cleavable transit sequence in the precursor n terminal region . in this paper we describe the identification of a new envelope protein component and demonstrate that its subcellular localization is limited to the inner _LOCATION_ of the chloroplast envelope . immunopurification microsequencing of the natural envelope protein and cloning of the corresponding full length cdna demonstrated that this protein is not processed in the n terminal region during its targeting to the inner envelope _LOCATION_ . transient _PROTEIN_ experiments in plant cells were performed with truncated _METHOD_ of the ceqorh protein fused to the green _METHOD_ protein . these experiments suggest that neither the n terminal nor the c terminal are essential for chloroplastic localization of the ceqorh protein . these observations are discussed in the frame of the endosymbiotic theory of chloroplast evolution and suggest that a domain of the ceqorh bacterial ancestor may have evolved so as to exclude the general requirement of an n terminal _LOCATION_ transit sequence .
during the course of the identification of new chloroplast envelope protein components some peptide sequences were obtained which shared homology with a putative arabidopsis protein _PROTEIN_ . whereas most of the envelope proteins identified during these early publications were highly hydrophobic this putative protein was structurally related to soluble bacterial fungal and animal proteins of known quinone oxidoreductase function . because of its possible function and since this ceqorh protein could participate in the redox chains previously detected in the chloroplast envelope _LOCATION_ we decided to further investigate the subcellular localization of this ceqorh protein . to obtain a polyclonal antibody raised against this protein the corresponding arabidopsis cdna was cloned and the full length protein was overexpressed in e. coli . the recombinant ceqorh protein overexpressed in e. coli was recovered in two distinct fractions a soluble fraction in the e. colicytosol and an insoluble fraction . as a high concentration of triton x did not release the insoluble fraction of the recombinant protein in the soluble phase this fraction is likely to correspond to aggregated protein . the soluble fraction of the n terminal his tagged recombinant protein was further purified by metal affinity chromatography . during this purification process the ceqorh protein still behaved as a soluble protein as expected for a member of this quinone oxidoreductase family . since the recombinant ceqorh protein appeared to be at least in part soluble in the e. colicytosol actual association of this protein with the chloroplast envelope remained to be demonstrated . western blots performed on chloroplast subfractions demonstrated that this protein is only present within the chloroplast envelope and not detected in other chloroplast subfractions . from these data it can be concluded that the ceqorh protein is associated exclusively with the envelope _LOCATION_ and is not a soluble stroma protein contaminating the envelope preparations . it is generally accepted that percoll purified intact chloroplasts are free from _LOCATION_ contaminants . however the ceqorh protein could be a soluble protein specifically interacting with the outer _LOCATION_ of the chloroplast envelope thus co purifying with the purified chloroplast envelope _LOCATION_ . to test this hypothesis intact chloroplasts were treated with the thermolysin ofbacillus thermoproteolyticus as previously described . as presented in the fig . b the ceqorh protein remained unaffected by the thermolysin treatment performed on intact _LOCATION_ . in contrast complete degradation of the ceqorh protein was observed when the same proteolytic treatment was performed on solubilized envelope proteins thus demonstrating the sensitivity of the ceqorh protein to thermolysin treatment . this result indicates that the ceqorh protein is not accessible to thermolysin from the _LOCATION_ surface of the chloroplast thus ruling out the hypothesis that the ceqorh protein could be a soluble _LOCATION_ contaminant of the chloroplast envelope preparations or an envelope component associated with the outer face of the outer envelope _LOCATION_ . finally immunodetection of the ceqorh protein demonstrated that this protein is only present in the inner _LOCATION_ of the chloroplast envelope _PROTEIN_ . the purity of the envelope subfractions was controlled using antibodies raised against and proteins which serve as marker molecules for inner and outer envelope _LOCATION_ proteins respectively . thus unlike the other members of this quinone oxidoreductase family the ceqorh protein behaves as a genuine _LOCATION_ protein . at this stage the apparent solubility of the recombinant ceqorh produced ine . coli and its exclusive localization in the inner _LOCATION_ of the chloroplast envelope were contradictory . one hypothesis was that ceqorh could be a soluble protein localized in the intermembrane space between the inner and the outer _LOCATION_ of the chloroplast envelope . this protein could be copurified with inner envelope preparations sequestrated in _LOCATION_ vesicles . some major soluble stroma proteins which are sequestrated in the envelope vesicles are known to contaminate envelope fractions . these proteins can be released from envelope preparations by opening/closing of the _LOCATION_ vesicles after sonication . since the ceqorh protein was not solubilized after sonication of _LOCATION_ vesicles it is likely to physically interact with the inner envelope _LOCATION_ . to test the nature of the association between ceqorh and the inner envelope _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ were washed by application of salt and alkaline treatments . one of the standard method to determine the interaction of a protein with a _LOCATION_ is to examine the effects of an alkaline solution which strips peripheral _LOCATION_ proteins leaving intrinsic proteins associated with the lipid bilayer . alkaline extractions using induced a release in the soluble phase of a major part of the protein and all the protein was solubilized using naoh treatment . these observations indicate that ceqorh is not a transmembrane protein bound to _LOCATION_ through strong hydrophobic interactions . indeed these observations are consistent with the predicted hydrophobicity of the ceqorh protein since no _LOCATION_ spanning domain could be predicted from its hydropathy profile . moreover salt treatments of envelope vesicles with nacl or ki also induced a partial release of the ceqorh protein in the soluble phase . because ceqorh binding to the _LOCATION_ is sensitive to high salt concentrations this suggests that electrostatic interactions play an important role in the ceqorh ability to bind to _LOCATION_ . moreover complete release of the ceqorh protein was achieved with a relatively low concentration of triton x whereas high concentrations are required to release intrinsic _LOCATION_ proteins . taken together these results indicate that ceqorh is a genuine inner envelope _LOCATION_ protein . it might be peripherally associated with the _LOCATION_ via electrostatic interactions with an intrinsic component of the inner envelope _LOCATION_ or with the _PROTEIN_ surface of this _LOCATION_ . moreover since the recombinant ceqorh protein was at least in part soluble when produced in e. coli this electrostatic interaction might occur via a plant specific posttranslational modification or via interaction with a specific envelope _LOCATION_ component . surprisingly while localized in the inner _LOCATION_ of the chloroplast envelope the ceqorh protein does not contain a classical n terminal additional sequence when compared with bacterial or animal homologues _PROTEIN_ . this observation raised the possibility that conversely to all other known inner envelope proteins the ceqorh could be targeted to the inner envelope of the chloroplast without classical cleavage of an n terminal transit sequence . to test this hypothesis new peptide sequence informations were required in the n terminal part of the envelope ceqorh protein . because the purest chloroplast envelope preparations are obtained from spinach and due to requirement of large amounts of envelope protein to perform this experiment the natural protein was purified from spinach envelope preparations . immunopurification of the native spinach ceqorh protein was performed using the polyclonal antibody raised against the arabidopsis ceqorh and _METHOD_ _METHOD_ analyses allowed obtaining several new peptide sequences from this purified protein . these peptide sequences were used to clone the spinach cdna coding the ceqorh protein . identity of the clone was confirmed since the nine different peptide sequences were identical to the primary sequence deduced from the spinach cdna . the spinach ceqorh protein presents identity and similarity with the arabidopsisceqorh protein . from screening all available databases no otherarabidopsis protein was found that presents more than identity with the ceqorh from arabidopsis or spinach . this strongly suggests that orthologous arabidopsis and spinach genes encode the two plant proteins . a stop codon localized in the utr of the cdna and in frame with the spinach ceqorh translation start codon was identified by two independent _PROTEIN_ pcr amplifications performed with two independent primers thus suggesting that the part of the cdna was complete . finally peptide sequences were obtained that correspond to the n terminal region of the primary sequence deduced from the ceqorh spinach cdna . surprisingly these data strongly suggested that in contrast with all other known inner envelope proteins the spinach ceqorh protein is not processed during its targeting to the inner _LOCATION_ of the chloroplast envelope . however these data could also be explained in another way . there are many reports on alternative splicing in higher plants and alternative splicing may occur that would induce synthesis of multiple _METHOD_ of ceqorh mrna . in this case several _PROTEIN_ pcr experiments showing the presence of only one transcript may not be totally conclusive . further evidence supporting the _PROTEIN_ that no additional n terminal sequence is required for the localization of ceqorh in chloroplast was obtained from in vivo _PROTEIN_ of the ceqorh in plant cells . transient _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ fusions were performed into both arabidopsis and tobacco cells . as expected the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein was distributed uniformly in the _LOCATION_ and in the _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ whereas the _LOCATION_ control _METHOD_ was targeted to the chloroplast _METHOD_ . transient _PROTEIN_ of the complete ceqorh protein were then performed . as shown in fig . _LOCATION_ localization was obtained with the ceqorh protein when _METHOD_ was fused to its c terminus . in conclusion this result indicates that the ceqorh does not require an additional n terminal for _LOCATION_ localization . sequence comparison between the ceqorh proteins and other proteins from the same family revealed that their first residues in the n terminal region are highly conserved from bacterial to plant and animal proteins . this observation strongly suggests that the n terminal region of the plant ceqorh proteins may not be directly required for the specific chloroplastic targeting but would have been most probably conserved through evolution due to selective pressure on a catalytic domain of the protein . for further examination of the domain required for _LOCATION_ localization of the ceqorh protein we generated several truncated versions of the ceqorh protein and transient _PROTEIN_ of corresponding _METHOD_ fusions were tested into arabidopsis and tobacco cells . surprisingly while lacking the n terminal or amino acids truncated _METHOD_ of the ceqorh protein could still drive the _METHOD_ to the _LOCATION_ ceqorh . this demonstrated that the n terminal part of ceqorh is not essential for _LOCATION_ localization . in contrast a truncated form of the ceqorh protein lacking the first amino acids and fused to the _METHOD_ was unable to drive the _METHOD_ to the _LOCATION_ ceqorh . this suggests that this n terminal part of ceqorh contains essential information to drive ceqorh to the _LOCATION_ . to test whether this n terminal part of ceqorh is sufficient to drive ceqorh to the _LOCATION_ the _PROTEIN_ of the first six to amino acids of the ceqorh protein fused to the _METHOD_ protein was tested . these first six to amino acids could drive _METHOD_ to _LOCATION_ ceqorh thus suggesting that this n terminal sequence contains essential and sufficient information to drive ceqorh to the _LOCATION_ and that the c terminal sequence is not required for _LOCATION_ localization . as the n terminal sequence is sufficient to drive ceqorh to the _LOCATION_ and since the first residues are not required for _LOCATION_ localization ceqorh these strongly suggests that an internal region of amino acids in the ceqorh protein is the only essential region required for _LOCATION_ localization . _PROTEIN_ of this internal ceqorh domain fused to the _METHOD_ protein was thus performed . however while essential for _LOCATION_ localization of the protein this domain appeared not to be sufficient to drive _METHOD_ to the _LOCATION_ ceqorh thus suggesting that association of this internal ceqorh region with a downstream or upstream sequence is required for _LOCATION_ localization .
