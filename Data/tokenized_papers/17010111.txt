taking advantage of the high conservation of the _LOCATION_ building blocks actin and tubulin between plant and animal _METHOD_ we developed a functional genomic screen for the isolation of new plant _LOCATION_ binding proteins that uses a mammalian cell _PROTEIN_ system . a yellow _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ fusion cdna library from arabidopsis was inserted into rat fibroblasts and screened for _METHOD_ chimeras localizing to cytoskeletal structures . the high throughput screen was performed by an automated microscope . an initial set of candidate genes identified in the screen was isolated sequenced the full length cdnas were synthesized by rt pcr and tested by biochemical approaches to verify the ability of the genes to bind actin directly . alternatively indirect binding via interaction with other actin binding proteins was studied . the full length cdnas were transferred back to plants as _METHOD_ chimeras behind the camv promoter . we give here two examples of new plant cytoskeletal proteins identified in the pilot screen . _LOCATION_ a member of the dehydrin family of proteins was localized to actin stress fibers in rat fibroblasts . its direct binding to actin filaments was confirmed by several biochemical approaches . touch induced calmodulin like protein _PROTEIN_ was also localized to actin stress fibers in fibroblasts but was unable to bind actin filaments directly in vitro . nevertheless it did bind to the iq domains of arabidopsis myosin viii in a calcium dependent manner . further evidence for a cytoskeletal function of _LOCATION_ was obtained in planta _METHOD_ _LOCATION_ was able to protect the actin _LOCATION_ from latrunculin mediated disruption in nicotiana benthamiana leaves .
a library of partial arabidopsis cdnas fused to venus _METHOD_ was constructed as described in experimental procedures . in order to verify the quality of the library random clones were sequenced . it was found that among the clones none were an empty vector and all clones were oriented with insert sizes ranging from to nucleotides . furthermore no clones corresponding to ribosomal rna were found . transforming the library into blue escherichia coli competent cells was highly efficient resulting in more than colonies of which were collected . in a control experiment dna made from a pool of clones and a mixture of the empty vectors was transfected into cells . it was found that although the transfection of the library resulted in many _METHOD_ cells the empty vectors gave only background _METHOD_ proving that each _METHOD_ clone observed in the screen contained an arabidopsis cdna insert in frame with _METHOD_ . cells were plated in well plates and infected . after h when _PROTEIN_ had peaked the culture was already confluent and covered the whole well . at this stage the cells were fixed . for the automatic high resolution high throughput screen we used an numerical aperture objective yielding images with field dimensions of . the size of a cell is approximately . thus it was possible to allow gaps between the acquired fields and still sample all cells in each well . in addition a rim of four fields _PROTEIN_ around the well periphery was not acquired because of poor optical conditions near the well edges . altogether the screen included images from each well . the time for each image acquisition was sec . thus a full plate screen required h . the computer memory required for storing this information was approximately gb . the infection efficiency was calibrated to to ensure that no more than between one and three retrovirus integrations occurred which might result in the masking of a specific localized clone by a diffuse cytoplasmic localized one . it was found in a pilot screen of clones that the number of _METHOD_ cells matched the expected efficiency of infection well . specifically the _METHOD_ cells observed _METHOD_ indicated a efficiency because only one third of the clones are in frame and _METHOD_ . a majority of the _METHOD_ cells exhibited diffuse cytoplasmic _METHOD_ . about displayed staining patterns with sub cellular localization such as to the perinuclear region the _LOCATION_ or cytoplasmic structures and about were localized to cytoskeletal structures such as actin stress fibers . some of the clones showing cytoskeletal localization in the pilot screen were isolated and sequenced . several clones contained an in frame fusion with _METHOD_ whereas others contained fragments from more than one gene fused in frame to _METHOD_ and a few clones were fused to _METHOD_ in a different open reading frame than the annotated gene creating peptides with the ability to bind actin stress fibers . at present we consider the latter to be the background of the system . in the future when completing a comprehensive screen we will use bioinformatics to study the presence of relevant amino acid key words in their sequence . in the small scale pilot screen presented here we did not isolate any known actin binding proteins however we fused the actin binding domain from arabidopsis to _METHOD_ in the mammalian _PROTEIN_ vector and _PROTEIN_ it in cells as a positive control . we chose two of the most promising genes isolated in the pilot screen for further study and to prove the concept of this unique method . the two clones chosen both of which gave prominent labeling of actin stress fibers in cells contained fragments belonging to _LOCATION_ a member of the dehydrin family and _PROTEIN_ . it is noteworthy that a second dehydrin family member _PROTEIN_ was also recovered from the pilot screen . the full length cdnas were isolated fused to _METHOD_ and re transfected into cells . fixation was carried out in the presence of triton x in order to remove soluble cytoplasmic proteins and double immuno staining for actin and vinculin was performed . as shown in figure the stress fibers in cells are decorated with the _LOCATION_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ chimeras as well as a known plant actin binding protein actin binding domain as a positive control . the structures labeled with the newly isolated genes _LOCATION_ and _PROTEIN_ were also stained with _METHOD_ phalloidin and their ends were marked by vinculin labeling . this proves that the filamentous structures labeled by _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ are genuine actin stress fibers . to examine whether the decoration of stress fibers in cells results from the ability of these putative actin interacting proteins to bind actin filaments directly we _PROTEIN_ recombinant proteins as fusions with _PROTEIN_ in bacterial cells . fusion proteins were isolated by affinity chromatography the _PROTEIN_ tag removed by thrombin cleavage and the resulting purified recombinant protein tested for binding to actin filaments prepared from muscle actin isoform . initially high speed co sedimentation assays were performed to detect interactions between side binding proteins and pre formed actin filaments . _LOCATION_ but not _PROTEIN_ demonstrated binding to actin filaments in a dose dependent manner . compared with arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ the binding of _LOCATION_ appeared to be somewhat weaker . unfortunately a substantial quantity of _LOCATION_ also sedimented in the absence of actin filaments making an accurate determination of kd impossible . to confirm the binding of _LOCATION_ to actin filaments several either kinetic or steady state assays for actin polymerization were performed using pyrene labeled actin . at steady state the actin monomer binding protein profilin increased the critical concentration for actin filament assembly by sequestering actin subunits and preventing their polymerization . _LOCATION_ had the opposite effect on actin polymerization markedly lowering the cc value at equilibrium and this is consistent with the stabilization of actin filaments . when actin polymerization from monomers was monitored as a function of time a typical curve for assembly showed a lag period for actin filament nucleation a period of rapid growth and ultimately a plateau of polymer formation . _LOCATION_ inhibited actin polymerization in a dose dependent manner extending the period required for nucleation and reducing the rate of polymerization . the filament side binding and cross linking protein _PROTEIN_ had similar effects in this assay . also like _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ inhibited actin filament depolymerization following dilution . increasing quantities of _LOCATION_ reduced the rate and extent of actin filament disassembly in a dose dependent manner but was not quite as potent as _PROTEIN_ under the identical conditions . the collective results strongly support the notion that _LOCATION_ is capable of binding to either the side or the ends of actin filaments in vitro and alters the dynamics of actin . as for _PROTEIN_ which did not bind and co sediment with actin filaments in vitro it was still plausible that it bound actin stress fibers indirectly by associating with another actin binding protein . calmodulin and calmodulin like proteins can be myosin light chains through binding to the iq domain on the heavy chains of both conventional and unconventional myosins . therefore we considered the possibility that overexpressed plant _PROTEIN_ was recognizing and binding the iq domain of non muscle rat myosin ii and thereby associating with the actin stress fibers of cells . in order to address the question of whether _PROTEIN_ has the potential to be a plant myosin light chain a fragment of cdna corresponding to the four iq domains of myosin viii from arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ was fused to _PROTEIN_ . it was found that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was pulled down by _PROTEIN_ iq in a calcium dependent manner . in order to obtain more information about the specificity of the interaction between _PROTEIN_ and the iq domain of _PROTEIN_ we characterized another isoform of tch . _PROTEIN_ is a touch induced calmodulin that was originally isolated in the same screen together with _PROTEIN_ . we cloned the _PROTEIN_ cdna and _PROTEIN_ it as a _METHOD_ fusion protein . as myosin light chains are generally either calmodulins or calmodulin like proteins it was important to determine whether the iq domain of myosin viii binds either generally or specifically to these proteins . in contrast to _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was unable to bind to the _PROTEIN_ iq domain in a pull down assay which reinforces the specificity of the _PROTEIN_ interaction . in order to learn more about the possible interaction and effect of _LOCATION_ on the actin _LOCATION_ in planta we labeled actin and _LOCATION_ with two different _METHOD_ proteins . the _METHOD_ chimeras of _METHOD_ _LOCATION_ and dsred were transiently _PROTEIN_ in n. benthamiana leaves using agrobacterium infiltration . as a control dsred was co _PROTEIN_ with _METHOD_ alone . the subcellular localization of _LOCATION_ was _PROTEIN_ cytoplasmic perhaps because of overexpression . two days after infiltration leaf disks were treated with latrunculin b for h and then inspected with the confocal microscope . as shown in figure in the presence of _METHOD_ alone actin filaments were severely disrupted by latb . however in the presence of _LOCATION_ the actin _LOCATION_ was protected from latb mediated disruption which is consistent with our in vitro data . quantitative analysis of latb mediated disruption of actin in the presence of either _METHOD_ _LOCATION_ or _METHOD_ alone was performed with the fiberscore image analysis software . ten independent microscopic fields from different leaves were examined in three different experiments . in each image the signal coming from near the cell wall was deleted in order to ensure that the computer reads only genuine actin filaments and then the image was subjected to fiberscore analysis . as shown in figure each actin filament and actin cable in the original image was interpreted by the computer as a cytoskeletal element and was given a color according to its direction . the summary of such analysis showed that in the presence of _LOCATION_ more than of the filament associated intensity and of the total area of filamentous structures remained after latb treatment whereas in the presence of _METHOD_ alone < of the intensity and area of actin filaments remained after latb treatment . the difference was statistically significant as tested by student 's t test .
a microscope system was developed that included a computer controlled stage for multi well plate scanning fast laser auto focusing for high magnification imaging extremely sensitive back illuminated digital ccd camera and modular controlling software for fully automated operation . the system acquired gb of image data per day and via a client server link saved and analyzed the data practically on line . currently the images are collected automatically but inspected and sorted manually . a cdna library was prepared from week old arabidopsis thaliana type columbia seedlings _PROTEIN_ ohio state university oh usa . the library was constructed using the smart cdna library construction kit . the _PROTEIN_ vector used for fusion to _METHOD_ is the clontech retroviral vector _PROTEIN_ that was modified as follows a cdna of the improved higher _METHOD_ venus version of _METHOD_ without its _PROTEIN_ was inserted between the noti and clai of the _PROTEIN_ multiple cloning site . a bamhi site and a linker of ser gly thr gly ser in three reading frames were added upstream to the _METHOD_ . the full length arabidopsis cdnas were first digested with sfii and then partially digested with which is a four cutter enzyme compatible with bamhi . the cdna fragments were ligated between sfiia and bamhi . and cells were cultured in dulbecco 's modified eagle 's medium _PROTEIN_ supplemented with fetal calf serum in a _PROTEIN_ incubator . for infection cells were transfected with of library dna and of helper virus using the ca phosphate method in the presence of chloroquine . after days the virions were collected from the medium filtered through a nitrocellulose filter and added to the culture with polybrene . the latter step was repeated three times . ref cells were fixed with paraformaldehyde in _PROTEIN_ h after infection and examined by the microscope . transfection into cells was carried out with transit reagent using the manufacturer 's instructions . bacterial colonies containing the arabidopsis cdna clones were individually collected into sixty well plates . dna was prepared from two pools of clones . the pooled dna was infected into rat fibroblasts screened with the microscope and scored for potential clones that showed interesting sub cellular localization patterns . the fibroblast cells were infected in well plates . each well was seeded with cells that were infected cultured for days and screened . each pool yielding _LOCATION_ localizing clones was sub divided into smaller pools of clones . from the positive well plates we prepared eight pools from the rows and pools from the columns . these were screened and positive clones were localized in the wells at the intersection of a positive row and column . single clones localizing to actin stress fibers were isolated from the wells and purified dna was re transfected into cells cultured on a cover slip . the verification of their localization was carried out by double labeling with specific markers such as coumarine phalloidin for actin filaments and anti vinculin antibody a marker for focal contacts and a _METHOD_ secondary antibody conjugated to _PROTEIN_ . images were acquired by an olympus microscope equipped with an orca ccd camera and each fluorophore was colored artificially . n. benthamiana leaves were inspected by a confocal olympus microscope equipped with an scanner . _METHOD_ was detected by a nm excitation filter and and red _METHOD_ protein was detected by a nm excitation filter and ba filter . image analysis was performed using the fiberscore
