arabidopsis exocyst subunit _PROTEIN_ has been reported to participate in embryo development . here we report that _PROTEIN_ is involved during pollen germination . a t dna insertion in _PROTEIN_ leads to an absolute male specific transmission defect that can be complemented by the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ coding sequence from the promoter or _PROTEIN_ genomic dna . no obvious abnormalities in the microgametogenesis are observed in the _PROTEIN_ mutant however in vitro and in vivo pollen germination are defective . further studies reveal that the callose pectin and cellulose are apparently not deposited at the germination site during pollen germination . _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ ubiquitously including in pollen grains and pollen tubes . notably _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion proteins are specifically recruited to the future pollen germination site . this particular localization pattern is independent of phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate _PROTEIN_ although _PROTEIN_ his fusion proteins are able to bind to several phosphoinositols in vitro . these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ plays an important role in the establishment of the _PROTEIN_ site for pollen germination .
the time and location of gene _PROTEIN_ often implies its function . to investigate the _PROTEIN_ pattern of _PROTEIN_ in detail a bp promoter region upstream from the _PROTEIN_ start codon was fused with a gus reporter gene and introduced into wild type arabidopsis plants . fifteen independent gus transgenic plants were obtained and six of them were chosen randomly and examined further . strong gus activities were detected in flowers mature pollen and pollen tubes . notably _PROTEIN_ started its _PROTEIN_ only in pollen from the bicellular stage which corresponded to the stage flower onwards . in addition _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was detected in seedlings root columella cells vascular bundles of root maturation zone and embryos suggesting a role of _PROTEIN_ in sporophytic development as well . in arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ shares sequence identity to _PROTEIN_ in the coding region and the two genes are arranged in tandem . it is therefore very important to explore the _PROTEIN_ pattern of _PROTEIN_ to predict whether they are functionally redundant in a particular tissue . in four gus lines obtained the gus staining of _PROTEIN_ looked much weaker than that of _PROTEIN_ which is consistent with the rt pcr results generated with gene specific primers . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was not detected in the pollen and pollen tube although it was noticed in tissues such as the cotyledon the root vascular bundles and the mature leaves . furthermore homozygotes obtained from the progeny of two _PROTEIN_ mutants showed no observable phenotype . these results indicate that _PROTEIN_ is the major _PROTEIN_ paralog in pollen . _PROTEIN_ gene contains exons and introns . one t dna line of the _PROTEIN_ gene _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was obtained where the insertion was in the last exon . pcr based genotyping revealed that no homozygous _PROTEIN_ mutant plants could be identified . the progeny from the self pollinated _PROTEIN_ plants segregated in a ratio of roughly instead of the expected indicating a disorder in gametophytic transmission rather than a zygotic lethality of the mutation . to investigate if the mutation in _PROTEIN_ affected male or female gametophytic development the _PROTEIN_ plants were used as male or female donors to cross with the wild type . when the _PROTEIN_ plants were crossed as female parents approximately of the resulting progenies were heterozygotes as expected for normal transmission . in contrast when pollen grains from the _PROTEIN_ were pollinated to wild type plants none of the seedlings were heterozygous plants . these results indicated that genetic transmission of _PROTEIN_ mutation through the male was abolished in the mutant while female gametophytic transmission was normal . male gametophytic lethal might be due to two possible defects . one is that haploid cells inherited the mutant allele after meiosis do not develop into mature pollen or they developed normally but are defective during pollen germination and/or tube growth or _PROTEIN_ stages of double fertilization . to address these two possibilities _PROTEIN_ was introgressed into the quartet _PROTEIN_ mutant background where four microspores from a microsporocyte fail to separate after meiosis but their functions are virtually unaffected . within a quartet two microspores are mutant _PROTEIN_ and the other two are wild type _PROTEIN_ . pollen grain development was examined using the quartets from _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plants . no difference in _LOCATION_ composition was observed in quartets at the unicellular bicellular and tricellular stages using dapi staining . in addition _PROTEIN_ pollen grains were morphologically comparable to wild type under the scanning electron microscope and they are viable as revealed by the alexander staining . together these results indicated that the mutation in _PROTEIN_ did not affect pollen development . pollen germination in vitro and in vivo were carried out with quartets of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . due to the ratio of the wild type versus mutant within a quartet from a heterozygote germination of three or four pollen grains in the quartet requires the germination of one or both mutant pollen grains . therefore a relative low percentage of quartets with three or four grains germinated would indicate a pollen germination defect . when cultured on a solid medium approximately of quartets from _PROTEIN_ plants had three or four pollen grains germinated while no quartet from _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plants could do the same . in vivo pollination assay was carried out using male sterile plants _METHOD_ as pollen recipient to avoid the potentially complicating effects of stigma maturity and emasculation stresses . while approximately of _PROTEIN_ quartet could germinate three or four pollen tubes into the pistil as revealed by aniline blue staining none of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ quartets was able to do that . these results suggested that _PROTEIN_ mutation significantly inhibited pollen germination in vitro and in vivo . to demonstrate that the mutant phenotype is caused by the disruption of _PROTEIN_ gene _PROTEIN_ plants were transformed with _PROTEIN_ coding sequence driven by the pollen specific promoter in a vector that confers resistance to hygromycin . transgenic plants hemizygous for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ loci in _PROTEIN_ mutant were obtained and several lines of each genotype were chosen randomly for further characterization . the male transmission defects were complemented with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and wild type progeny appearing at the expected mendelian ratio . moreover _PROTEIN_ homozygotes named as _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were identified using pcr based genotyping with progeny lines in which all seedlings showed hygromycin resistant _PROTEIN_ . rt pcr analysis of mutants indicated that the transcripts spanning or behind the t dna insertion sites were not _PROTEIN_ while the transcript before the insertion was detected . however it should be unstable due to the lack of poly tail . similarly _METHOD_ lines _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were obtained . furthermore twelve _PROTEIN_ lines bearing hemizygous _PROTEIN_ genomic dna were generated . in two randomly selected lines the male transmission efficiency increased to approximately indicating a complete complementation . in vitro pollen germination of two randomly selected lines were evaluated on the solid media . under the same conditions of wild type pollen grains and of that from _PROTEIN_ plants were able to germinate . remarkably in mutant the ratio was restored to that of the wild type . these date demonstrated that the male gametophytic defects were indeed due to t dna insertion in the _PROTEIN_ gene . to analyze the role of _PROTEIN_ more precisely the dynamic localization of _PROTEIN_ in the germinating pollen grains were explored . our studies showed that the male transmission was restored to normal in _PROTEIN_ mutant with hemizygous _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ lines could be identified . these results indicated that the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein is functional in pollen and therefore should display its correct subcellular localization . in _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ proteins appeared from the binucleated pollen stage onwards consistent with the gus analysis results . in mature pollen prior to activation _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was dispersed in the cytoplasm . interestingly after being placed in liquid germination medium for min _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was shift to the cortex of the future germination site before any visible change of pollen morphology was noticed and the signals oscillated at this position throughout the tube emerging process . in yeast directly interacted with _PROTEIN_ and marked the exocytic site at the bud . to test whether _PROTEIN_ could bind to _PROTEIN_ directly in vitro _PROTEIN_ was fused to his and _PROTEIN_ in e. coli . purified proteins were used in _PROTEIN_ strip overlay assays . as shown in _PROTEIN_ bound to several _LOCATION_ phosphoinositides including _PROTEIN_ while the control with bsa alone could not . in plants _PROTEIN_ could be generated through the phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol phosphate _PROTEIN_ by phosphatidylinositol phosphate kinases _PROTEIN_ . in _PROTEIN_ mutant the production of _PROTEIN_ and the _LOCATION_ recycling was _PROTEIN_ in pollen tubes . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was introduced into the _PROTEIN_ homozygous mutant and its localization was examined . interestingly _PROTEIN_ proteins still accumulated at the bulge of the germinating _PROTEIN_ pollen grain with bright _METHOD_ labeling just as in the wild type indicating that the localization of _PROTEIN_ in pollen was not dependent on _PROTEIN_ . pollen germination started with hydration which might act as a triggering signal . following hydration plaque formation starts and is completed within h by then the pollen tube has emerged . _PROTEIN_ deposition of callose cellulose and pectin is observed in the incipient bulge of germinating pollen grains . the phenotypes of mutant and the localization pattern of _PROTEIN_ prompted us to look into the cell wall deposition at the germination site . pollen grains from _PROTEIN_ mutant hemizygous for _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were used since mutant pollen _PROTEIN_ can easily distinguished from the complemented one _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ by the absence or presence of the _METHOD_ signal . calcofluor white which labels cellulose and callose appeared at the germination site in the complemented pollen grain colocalized with the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signals . similarly antibodies against callose low methylestified pectins and high methylestified pectins labeled the germination plaques in the complemented pollen grains respectively . in contrast mutant pollen exhibited an even staining of the cell wall with no sign of germination . in addition _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ quartets were stained with ruthenium red which labels a broad range of methylesterified pectins . ruthenium red strongly labeled the germination plaques of all four pollen grains of _PROTEIN_ while only two pollen grains of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ quartet could be labeled . even after h of germination when a quartet from _PROTEIN_ plant produced four pollen tubes _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ quartet still had two non germinated pollen grains that show no sign of _PROTEIN_ pectin deposition . thus pectin distribution revealed by ruthenium red is consistent with the and staining . together these data demonstrated that _PROTEIN_ accumulation of several types of cell wall materials was not observed in the germinating _PROTEIN_ pollen .
