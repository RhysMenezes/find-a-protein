to understand the early signaling steps in the response of plant cells to increased environmental temperature d difference gel electrophoresis was used to study the proteins in microsomes of arabidopsis seedlings that are regulated early during heat stress . using _METHOD_ _METHOD_ microsomal proteins that showed an altered _PROTEIN_ level within min after heat treatment were identified . among these proteins annexin _PROTEIN_ was one of those up regulated rapidly after heat shock treatment . functional studies show loss of function mutants for _PROTEIN_ and its close homolog were more sensitive to heat shock treatment whereas plants overexpressing _PROTEIN_ showed more resistance to this treatment . correspondingly the heat induced _PROTEIN_ of heat shock proteins and heat shock _PROTEIN_ is inhibited in _PROTEIN_ double mutant and the heat activated increase in cytoplasmic calcium concentration is greatly impaired in the _PROTEIN_ mutant and almost undetectable in _PROTEIN_ double mutant . taken together these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ is important in regulating the heat induced increase in cyt and in the response of arabidopsis seedlings to heat stress .
increased environmental temperature triggers heat shock responses _PROTEIN_ in plants however if the temperature rises above a certain limit or the duration of the high temperature is too long plants will not be able to survive . to study the _PROTEIN_ response of plant cells the treatment used should be strong enough to stimulate the _PROTEIN_ but at the same time mild enough not to kill the plant . in order to find a proper heat shock treatment condition for our proteomic studies plates containing one week old arabidopsis seedlings were treated at a range of temperatures and treatment durations and post treatment survival rates were calculated after the seedlings recovered at for week . treatment of arabidopsis seedlings in a water bath up to min did not induce irreversible damage to seedlings whereas treatment with a water bath for min killed almost all of the seedlings . in comparison seedlings treated with a water bath for min survived . as has been previously shown to induce _PROTEIN_ a water bath was used as our treatment temperature during the following proteomic studies . heat shock stimulates a rapid increase of the cyt . this increase can be seen as early as min after heat treatment and reaches the maximum around mins . in order to study the early cellular responses stimulated by _PROTEIN_ we exposed one week old arabidopsis seedlings to for mins and harvested them for dige analysis . protein samples from control and treated seedlings were analyzed in at least six biological repeat experiments . in average over protein spots were detected in each gel . examination of the dige images identified over spots that showed consistent abundance changes induced by heat shock . surprisingly the abundance of most spots was increased by heat treatment and only a few showed _PROTEIN_ levels . these spots of interest were picked digested in gel by trypsin and analyzed by lc _METHOD_ . a total of heat shock regulated protein spots which represented unique proteins were successfully identified . functional classification showed these proteins are involved in processes such as hormone biosynthesis protein translation calcium signaling cellular metabolism and protein folding . of all the microsomal proteins identified in table i we chose to further study _PROTEIN_ because of prior evidence showing that it could play a major role in mediating plant stress responses . using polyclonal antibody raised specific against a amino acid sequence from _PROTEIN_ we confirmed the dige result in which _PROTEIN_ protein levels increased in the microsomal fraction after mins of _PROTEIN_ . we then isolated transfer dna insertion mutants of _PROTEIN_ gene to investigate if _PROTEIN_ plays a significant role in _PROTEIN_ responses in arabidopsis . we obtained three insertion mutants for _PROTEIN_ and these alleles were named as _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . the t dna insertion sites in these alleles were located at the utr of the _PROTEIN_ gene _PROTEIN_ or within different positions of its second and third exon _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ respectively . reverse transcription pcr analysis of these t dna mutants showed that the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ is not detectable whereas the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ was not affected . we then compared the basal thermotolerance of these t dna insertional mutants with wild type seedlings . one week old seedlings were subjected to water bath for min and then allowed to recover at for another week before they were photographed and calculate their survival rate . consistent with the _PROTEIN_ of endogenous _PROTEIN_ level _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ seedlings were hypersensitive to heat shock treatment whereas heat sensitivity of _PROTEIN_ seedlings was similar to wild type plants . there are eight members of the arabidopsis annexin gene family . phylogenetic analysis indicates that _PROTEIN_ and are all closely related with and having identity at the amino acid level . there is _PROTEIN_ and immunolocalization evidence suggesting that _PROTEIN_ and have both distinct and overlapping functions in arabidopsis . to investigate if other annexins also participate in plant _PROTEIN_ responses we isolated t dna insertion mutants for and and tested basal thermotolerance of the mutant seedlings . the sensitivity of mutants to heat shock treatment is higher than wild type but lower than _PROTEIN_ mutants . in contrast knocking out the _PROTEIN_ of did not alter the sensitivity of the mutant to heat shock treatment . we then generated an _PROTEIN_ double mutant by crossing with _PROTEIN_ and found the _PROTEIN_ double mutant seedlings were more sensitive to heat stress treatment than the _PROTEIN_ single mutants . these results indicated _PROTEIN_ and but not play redundant roles in regulating plant heat shock responses . heat stress induced _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ plays an important role in the acquisition of thermotolerance by plants . to investigate whether the susceptibility of annexin mutants to heat stress is related to the level of endogenous _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ the heat induced _PROTEIN_ of different _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were analyzed in seedlings of wild type and _PROTEIN_ double mutants . under normal conditions _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ is either not detected or at a similar level in both wild type and _PROTEIN_ double mutants . thirty minutes of heat shock induces a dramatic increase of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in wild type seedlings . in comparison the increase in _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ double mutants is much smaller . similar results were observed for the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ . before heat shock treatment the protein levels of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ double mutants were similar to wild type . after heat shock at for h the protein abundance of these three proteins in wild type seedlings was significantly higher than in those of the _PROTEIN_ mutants . the reduced _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ mutants after heat treatment suggests annexin is required for the early changes in gene _PROTEIN_ induced by heat shock . to further confirm the function of annexin in plants heat shock response we overexpressed _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ mutant background . rt pcr analysis confirmed that the _PROTEIN_ level of _PROTEIN_ in two transgenic lines ox and ox were both higher than in wild type . seedlings overexpressing _PROTEIN_ were more resistant to heat shock treatment than wild type seedlings . the average survival rate of annexin overexpressing seedlings was higher than wild type seedlings and the difference is statistically significant . this result demonstrates that the _PROTEIN_ level of annexin is directly related to the basal thermotolerance of young arabidopsis seedlings . prior reports indicated that _PROTEIN_ could function to increase the permeability of _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ during plant stress responses . in order to test whether heat induced calcium transport is altered in _PROTEIN_ loss of function mutants we crossed the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants with transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ aequorin segregant lines that were homozygous for and mutants were chosen and used for monitoring heat shock stimulated changes in cyt . rt pcr showed the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ and is not detectable in our aequorin _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double knockout mutant . measurement of _LOCATION_ calcium concentration showed the highest luminescence signal emitted by reconstituted aequorin is lower in aequorin _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants which might be caused by the lower total calcium abundance in the seedlings . because there is a difference in the reconstituted luminescence signals observed between wild type and the mutants we used percentage reconstitution values to determine the relative luminescence in response to heat shock treatment for wild type and mutants seedlings . as shown in fig . in consistent with previous reports heat shock treatment induced a rapid increase in cyt within min in wild type _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants . the heat induced cyt continues to increase in wild type and reaches the highest peak around min . in comparison this prolonged increase in the heat induced cyt was diminished in _PROTEIN_ mutant and absent in _PROTEIN_ double mutant . these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ and function is important for the normal heat induced increase in cyt in arabidopsis .
