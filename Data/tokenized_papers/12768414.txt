homologous recombination results in the exchange and rearrangement of dna and thus generates genetic variation in living _METHOD_ . reca is known to function in all bacteria as the central enzyme catalyzing strand transfer and has functional homologues in eukaryotes . most of our knowledge of homologous recombination in eukaryotes is limited to processes in the _LOCATION_ . the mitochondrial genomes of higher plants contain repeated sequences that are known to undergo frequent rearrangements and recombination events . however very little is known about the proteins involved or the biochemical _METHOD_ of dna recombination in plant mitochondria . we provide here the first report of an arabidopsis thaliana homologue of escherichia coli reca that is targeted to mitochondria . the mtreca gene has a putative mitochondrial presequence identified from the a. thaliana genome database . this _LOCATION_ gene encodes a predicted product that shows highest sequence homology to chloroplast reca and reca proteins from proteobacteria . when fused to the _METHOD_ coding sequence the predicted presequence was able to target the fusion protein to isolated mitochondria but not to chloroplasts . the _LOCATION_ specific localization of the mtreca gene product was confirmed by western analysis using polyclonal antibodies raised against a synthetic peptide from a unique region of the mature mtreca . the arabidopsis mtreca gene partially complemented a reca deletion in e. coli enhancing survival after exposure to dna damaging agents . these results suggest a possible role for mtreca in homologous recombination and/or repair in arabidopsis mitochondria .
a putative reca gene homologue that encodes a residue preprotein with a predicted residue mitochondrial presequence was identified by a blast search of the arabidopsis _LOCATION_ genome database . the search yielded a single reca homologue that was predicted with high probability to be targeted to mitochondria by the psort predotar targetp and mitop prediction _METHOD_ . while the chlorop program gave a probability of for targeting of this gene product to chloroplasts this program identified no targeting presequence . the other prediction _METHOD_ yielded probabilities of or less for import of mtreca into chloroplasts with no predicted targeting presequences . a total of four reca homologues were found in the arabidopsis genome database but the mtreca gene was the only one with a clear prediction for a mitochondrial targeting sequence . the second homologue has a predicted chloroplast targeting sequence and has already been shown to be imported into chloroplasts but the mitop program gave a prediction of for targeting to mitochondria with a putative amino acid targeting presequence . the work presented by cao et al . does not include experiments designed to determine whether this protein is imported into mitochondria so it is possible that this protein could be targeted to both organelles . the other two rec a homologues have mixed low or no organelle targeting predictions and lack clear targeting sequences so it is not clear whether these proteins might be targeted to an organelle or whether they remain in the cytoplasm . the sequence in addition to lacking a predicted targeting sequence contains a number of additional amino acids at the c terminal end suggesting that this protein may be functionally distinct . the sequence is much shorter than the others and lacks a considerable number of amino acids at the n terminal end and near the c terminal end particularly in regions involved in dna and nucleotide binding . thorough analysis of upstream sequences beyond those shown in fig . identified no additional in frame methionine codons that do not have intervening in frame stop codons suggesting that the sequences shown are likely to be those of the actual protein products . a full length cdna clone of the mtreca gene was obtained and the dna sequence was confirmed . northern analysis using the est clone insert as probe at high stringency confirmed that this gene is transcribed in arabidopsis plants as expected given the origin of the clone . the mtreca gene shows a very different organization to the ctreca gene with respect to the number size and location of exons and introns . comparisons of the predicted arabidopsis mtreca sequence with reca sequences from several different _METHOD_ indicated that it is most closely related to the arabidopsis reca targeted to chloroplasts and to members of the alpha proteobacteria . the selectively amplified mitochondrial presequence region of arabidopsis mtreca encoding the predicted amino acid targeting peptide sequence was cloned into a _METHOD_ fusion vector to produce a presequence _METHOD_ fusion protein ps _METHOD_ . in vitro import studies with purified soybean mitochondria showed specific import of ps _METHOD_ into mitochondria and not into chloroplasts . a control experiment with the same protein and purified chloroplasts confirmed that the fusion is not imported into isolated chloroplasts . the red _METHOD_ results from the chlorophyll in the chloroplasts and did not co localize with _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . no _METHOD_ was detected in mitochondria incubated with _METHOD_ lacking a presequence demonstrating that a targeting sequence is necessary for the localization of _METHOD_ to mitochondria . samples that had not been exposed to proteinase k treatment or reisolation on percoll gradients showed a considerable background _METHOD_ that did not colocalize with organelles indicating that digestion with proteinase k and reisolation on percoll gradients was sufficient to remove _METHOD_ not localized within mitochondria . dic images of the same fields were used to correlate localized _METHOD_ with mitochondria . the polyclonal antibody prepared against a synthetic amino acid peptide representing a unique region near the n terminal end of the mature mtreca protein recognized a single specific polypeptide of the expected size in total protein extracts from purified arabidopsis mitochondria and did not cross react with the purified chloroplast sample . preimmune serum did not react with any of the proteins on the _LOCATION_ . as a control for the purity of the organelle fractions and the specificity of the antibody an antibody against chloroplast a/b binding protein was tested and gave a signal only with the chloroplast protein sample and not with mitochondria . as a positive control for mitochondria antibody against mitochondrial outer _LOCATION_ porin was tested and gave a signal only for the mitochondrial sample and not the chloroplast sample . the antiserum raised against the synthetic fragment of mtreca showed no cross reaction with purified e. coli reca protein a wild type e. coli strain _PROTEIN_ native reca or the strain of e. coli used for overexpression of mtreca but did react strongly with a protein of the expected size in a total protein extract of the e. coli strain overexpressing mtreca . histidine tagged mtreca protein from e. coli was batch purified on a _PROTEIN_ agarose column and analyzed by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and western blotting . the majority of overexpressed mature mtreca protein was found in the soluble protein fraction . antibodies against the chloroplast reca protein were found to cross react with the over _PROTEIN_ mtreca protein as expected . the tag added kda to the molecular weight of the protein . arabidopsis mtreca when _PROTEIN_ in e. coli under the control of an inducible promoter in a high copy number plasmid conferred resistance to the dna alkylating agent methylmethanesulfonate _METHOD_ and the dna crosslinking agent mitomycin c . comparison of surviving fractions of the reca strain _PROTEIN_ with the same strain bearing the mtreca plasmid showed that induction of mtreca _PROTEIN_ with iptg provided up to a fold increase in resistance to _METHOD_ and an almost fold enhancement of resistance to dna damage by mitomycin c. derepression by iptg was carried out at one tenth the concentration used for over _PROTEIN_ to avoid the formation of inclusion bodies . plots of iptg levels against the survival rates of the treated cultures showed that mm iptg produced survival rates comparable to those of the uninduced control rec a strain . the levels of mtreca _PROTEIN_ in the presence of mm iptg were analyzed by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and observed to be comparable to the levels in the wild type strain .
the blue and strains of e. coli were used as hosts for routine cloning and isolation of ssdna . the strain was obtained from novagen . a _PROTEIN_ strain _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _METHOD_
