the actin _LOCATION_ plays a crucial role in many aspects of plant cell development . during male gametophyte development the actin arrays are conspicuously remodeled both during pollen maturation in the anther and after pollen hydration on the receptive stigma and pollen tube elongation . remodeling of actin arrays results from the highly orchestrated activities of numerous actin binding proteins _PROTEIN_ . a key player in actin remodeling is the actin depolymerizing _PROTEIN_ which increases actin filament treadmilling rates . we prepared _METHOD_ protein fusions of two arabidopsis pollen specific adfs _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . we monitored the _PROTEIN_ and subcellular localization of these proteins during male gametophyte development pollen germination and pollen tube growth . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were differentially _PROTEIN_ with the _PROTEIN_ signal appearing in the microspore stage and that of _PROTEIN_ only during the _PROTEIN_ microspore stage . _PROTEIN_ was associated with the microspore _LOCATION_ and the vegetative _LOCATION_ of the mature grain during less metabolically active stages but in germinating pollen grains and elongating pollen tubes it was associated with the subapical actin fringe . on the other hand _PROTEIN_ was associated with filamentous actin in the developing gametophyte in particular with the arrays surrounding the apertures of the mature pollen grain . in the shank of elongating pollen tubes _PROTEIN_ was associated with _PROTEIN_ actin cables . we propose possible specific functions of these two adfs based on their differences in _PROTEIN_ and localization .
transcriptomic and proteomic data have shown that in arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ seem to be _PROTEIN_ specifically in pollen . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ share similarity in their amino acid sequences when using ncbi blast . _PROTEIN_ shares between and similarity with the other members of the arabidopsis adf family members while for _PROTEIN_ this similarity is somewhat lower with . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ share > similarity in their amino acid sequence with the other two members of the subclass adfs i.e . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . a prediction search for possible _LOCATION_ export signals using the netnes server of the technical university of denmark yielded a positive peak at amino acid for both adfs with a score for _PROTEIN_ and a score for _PROTEIN_ . in order to visualize _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ we transformed a. thaliana with chimeric _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ genes tagged with the genes for _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ respectively under the control of their respective native promoter and terminator sequences . to assess the _PROTEIN_ pattern of the fusion proteins in the transformed plants we examined _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in roots root hairs _METHOD_ leaves trichomes and all flower organs . with the exception of the male gametophyte we did not observe any _METHOD_ above the background level in any of these organs . this _METHOD_ that arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ when _PROTEIN_ as _METHOD_ protein chimeras under the control of their own promoters are indeed pollen specific . to assert that the chimeric genes were not significantly overexpressed in the mutants we assessed their _PROTEIN_ in the inflorescence using semi quantitative rt pcr . the presence of both chimeric genes caused slightly reduced _PROTEIN_ of the respective native genes . _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was at a similar level than the endogene and _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was significantly lower than that of the respective endogene . to determine the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ during the development of the male gametophyte we harvested different stages of pollen from transformed arabidopsis plants and observed them by confocal microscopy . the developmental stages were annotated based on the description of gametophyte morphology by twell and coworkers . in order to visualize the _LOCATION_ pollen grains were also stained with diamidino phenylindole prior to observation . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ appeared for the first time during the early microspore stage just after tetrad separation . prior to this stage no significant label was visible in the developing gametophyte . after tetrad separation _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ labeled microspores displayed diffuse _METHOD_ in the cytoplasm and slightly more intense label in the _LOCATION_ . at this stage _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was not yet visible . at the _PROTEIN_ microspore stage _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was still present in the _LOCATION_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ started to appear in short rod shaped aggregates in the cytoplasm . just before the bicellular stage _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ disappeared from the _LOCATION_ and diffusely labeled the cytoplasm while _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was associated with longer filamentous structures in the cytoplasm . at the bicellular stage some _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ accumulated around the vegetative _LOCATION_ and slightly denser aggregates started appearing in the periphery of the cytoplasm . at this developmental stage _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ appeared to be associated with longer filamentous structures a portion of which was aggregated around the vegetative _LOCATION_ but most were concentrated at the periphery of the cell . at the mature pollen stage short filamentous elements labeled for _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were present around the vegetative _LOCATION_ while longer and more densely packed filaments dominated the periphery of the cytoplasm which also contained diffuse _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ at this stage displayed a very similar localization to that in the bicellular stage with filamentous structures around the vegetative _LOCATION_ and a dense mesh of filaments mostly at the periphery of the cytoplasm . just before anthesis _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ formed a dense mesh of long filaments in the periphery of the cytoplasm and diffuse _METHOD_ was present throughout the cytoplasm and in the vegetative _LOCATION_ . label intensity was higher at the apertures . before anthesis _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ on the other hand more specifically targeted filamentous structures in the periphery of the cytoplasm with very little diffuse label and no _METHOD_ in the _LOCATION_ . in pollen from open flowers _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ labeled the vegetative _LOCATION_ and was present as a dense filamentous mesh in the periphery with high concentration at the apertures . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ label assumed the shape of longer and _PROTEIN_ filaments located at the apertures and oriented parallel to their long axes . optical sections and surface rendering demonstrated that the label was located in the periphery of the cytoplasm and it was not detectable in the central regions of the cytoplasm . to identify the filamentous structures associated to which _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ label was observed we labeled mature pollen _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ from open flowers with rhodamine phalloidin following chemical fixation . the spatial configuration of the filamentous structures labeled for the adf and for actin were near identical . surprisingly the filamentous structures labeled for _PROTEIN_ were frequently longer than the corresponding structures labeled with phalloidin . a possible explanation may be that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ sterically blocks potential phalloidin binding sites on the actin filaments . moreover it has been shown that adf saturated actin filaments lose their phalloidin binding sites due to changes in the actin filament twist . in order to further confirm the nature of the filamentous structures labeled with _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ we administered latb to pollen grains . latb is a toxin isolated from the red sea sponge latrunculia magnifica that sequesters g actin leading to f actin depolymerization due to the ongoing disassembly at the minus ends of the filaments . following latb treatment the filamentous structures labeled with phalloidin disappeared partly or entirely . similarly label for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ lost its filamentous configuration . any remaining filamentous structures coincided with structures labeled by phalloidin . diffuse _METHOD_ of _PROTEIN_ in the cytoplasm was strongly enhanced as a result of the latb treatment . interestingly after treatment of pollen from dehiscent flowers with latb _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was associated with the vegetative _LOCATION_ . actin arrays are typically highly dynamic . in order to assess whether the adf labeled structures behaved similarly we acquired time lapse series of hydrated pollen grains from open flowers of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ mutants . the structures labeled with _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ were highly dynamic as would be consistent with the behavior of actin filaments . pollen germination requires the delivery of secretory vesicles to the aperture and the actin _LOCATION_ is known to form characteristic arrays prior to and during germination . in order to assess whether _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ is involved in the remodeling of the actin _LOCATION_ prior to and during pollen germination we placed mature pollen in germination medium for h before observation . when the pollen grain started germinating the filamentous elements labeled by _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ disappeared from the grain and appeared associated with long filamentous cables seemingly winding around the tip of the newly emerging tube . in newly developed pollen tubes filaments labeled with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were associated with the tip of the tube and a significant amount of diffuse label was visible in the shank of the cell and in the pollen grain . in older pollen tubes _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ targeted long filamentous cables in the subapical region of the tube and throughout the shank region . in germinating pollen grains _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was confined to the periphery of the emerging pollen tube . once the tube had almost attained a length that corresponded to the diameter of the grain most of the label was found inside the tube and almost no label was left in the grain . the label was associated with longer filamentous structures that were densely packed and could be observed to form loops . compared with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ the number of individual filaments labeled by _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ seemed much higher and their arrangement denser . as the tube continued to grow the _METHOD_ label for _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ became more concentrated in the subapex where it formed shorter filaments . pollen grains with longer tubes displayed a few _PROTEIN_ cables that continued from the grain into the tube . less pronounced but clearly visible label was associated with the subapical fringe in longer tube pollen tube . to confirm the nature of the filamentous structure in the pollen tubes _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ pollen tubes were fixed and labeled for actin with rhodamine phalloidin . the label patterns for _METHOD_ and rhodamine _METHOD_ were identical confirming that adf is associated with the actin _LOCATION_ .
to reproduce the _PROTEIN_ level and pattern of the target gene the construct included the untranslated region and promoter sequences the coding region with introns and the utr and the terminator region . to minimize further effects of the _METHOD_ tag on native subcellular localization and function of the chimeric protein the location of the tag relative to the target gene was determined based on computer assisted predictions of protein folding and functional domains . arabidopsis plants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were generated using the _PROTEIN_ technique . two sets of primers and were designed to amplify each of the target genes in two fragments . and contained and recombination sites respectively in addition to gene specific sequences . and contained gene specific sequences and _METHOD_ tag specific sequences . _PROTEIN_ was labeled with the cyan variant of the yellow _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ while _PROTEIN_ was labeled with _METHOD_ . both tags contained a glycine rich linker peptide at the n terminal side and an alanine rich linker peptide at the c terminal region to reduce interference with protein folding . _PROTEIN_ primer sequences
