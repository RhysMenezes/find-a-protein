plants play a prominent role as sulfur reducers in the global sulfur cycle . sulfate the major form of inorganic sulfur utilized by plants is absorbed and transported by specific sulfate transporters into _LOCATION_ especially chloroplasts where it is reduced and assimilated into cysteine before entering other metabolic processes . how sulfate is transported into the chloroplast however remains unresolved no _LOCATION_ localized sulfate transporters have been previously identified in higher plants . here we report that is localized in the chloroplast which was demonstrated by _METHOD_ localization western blot analysis protein import as well as comparative analysis of sulfate uptake by chloroplasts between knockout mutants complemented transgenic plants and the wild type . loss of significantly _PROTEIN_ the sulfate uptake of the chloroplast . complementation of the mutant phenotypes by _PROTEIN_ of a construct further _METHOD_ that is one of the transporters responsible for sulfate transport into chloroplasts .
the subcellular localization of was examined using transgenic arabidopsis plants _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . confocal images show that the green _METHOD_ of the _METHOD_ fusion protein is localized in the chloroplasts of _METHOD_ transformants while the chloroplasts in wild type cells show only red _METHOD_ . the green _METHOD_ of the _METHOD_ fusion protein was also found in _LOCATION_ in hypocotyl cells . to examine where in the chloroplast _METHOD_ was localized we analyzed chloroplast protein fractions using western blot with anti _METHOD_ antibody . positive signals were found in total protein extract of _METHOD_ plants _METHOD_ the protein from whole chloroplasts and the chloroplast envelope _LOCATION_ fraction but not in _LOCATION_ of _METHOD_ plants . _PROTEIN_ protein a _LOCATION_ marker was not detected in the envelope fraction . given that contains multiple _LOCATION_ spanning domains the result suggests that is localized in the envelope _LOCATION_ of arabidopsis chloroplasts . these experiments can not entirely rule out that _METHOD_ fusion protein was mis targeted to chloroplasts in _METHOD_ transgenic plants . a chloroplast protein import experiment was therefore carried out to verify the chloroplast localization of . the n terminal amino acids of _PROTEIN_ were fused to the n terminus of luciferase . the chloroplasts were incubated with the in vitro translated luciferase or the n terminus luciferase fusion protein . the fused luciferase was detected in both the chloroplasts and the supernatant while luciferase was only detected in the supernatant . sulfate uptake into chloroplasts by sultr type transport was functionally characterized using uptake experiments with labeled sulfate . intact chloroplasts were isolated from the rosette leaves of week old wild type plants . to verify the integrity of the isolated chloroplasts the hill reaction was used to determine the activity of chloroplasts . dichlorophenol indophenol was used as electron acceptor instead of nadp . ammonia was used as inhibitor to eliminate the proton gradient . the result shows that the reaction was light dependent indicating the isolated chloroplasts were intact and active . given that the sultr family are proton coupled transporters the isolated chloroplasts should show a ph dependent sulfate uptake . the ph dependence of sulfate uptake of the isolated chloroplasts was examined at ph and respectively . the sulfate uptake rate of isolated chloroplasts from wild type plants was significantly higher at ph in comparison with ph which is in agreement with the proton coupled symport of sultr type sulfate transporters . in the uptake assay _LOCATION_ bound radioactive sulfate was negligible after washing of chloroplast with mm non radioactive . the quantitative contribution of to the transport of sulfate into chloroplasts was determined by comparison of the uptake kinetics of radioactive labeled sulfate by isolated chloroplasts of the knockout mutants and the complementation transgenic line and the wild type plants . the knockout mutant line was the same line used by zuber et al . . the in organello sulfate uptake was assayed with nine exogenous sulfate concentrations from to mm which covered the range of _LOCATION_ sulfate content . the intact chloroplasts were adjusted to the same concentration for each line before the uptake experiments . according to the previous ph dependent uptake assay the reaction buffer was adjusted to ph to provide a sufficient proton gradient . the kinetic results are shown in figure . the sulfate uptake rates of the chloroplasts from knockout mutants were significantly _PROTEIN_ compared with that of the wild type which could be reverted to the wild type level when the mutant was complemented with . the two knockout mutants showed a lower vmax but similar km compared with the wild type plants . the vmax of the mutant _PROTEIN_ by compared with the wild type . the _PROTEIN_ should be contributed by the knockout . we used the same in organello sulfate uptake assay to examine whether the other four members of subfamily are also involved in chloroplast sulfate transport . the kinetic results are shown in figure for the mutants and the wild type . the sulfate uptake rates of the chloroplasts from knockout mutants except were significantly _PROTEIN_ compared with that of the wild type . knockout mutants showed a lower vmax than the wild type plants while in knockout mutant the vmax was not significantly different from the wild type . the km of the mutants did not show a statistically significant difference from that of the wild type . based on vmax values the contribution of sulfate influx into chloroplasts by and was estimated at and of the wild type respectively . promoter analysis in transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ the promoter gus reporter construct displayed gus staining in green tissues as shown in figure which is consistent with the previously reported preferential _PROTEIN_ of in leaves of seedlings and mature plants . in addition flowers and seeds also stained positive for gus suggesting that also functions in the _LOCATION_ of flowers and seeds . no gus staining however occurred in roots under normal conditions . to examine the effect of disruption on thiols we measured the cysteine and glutathione contents in leaves of different ages of plants grown in soil under normal conditions . no significant difference was found except for the younger leaves after the seventh true leaf in which the cysteine content was significantly lower than the wild type and the complementation line . this result is consistent with a previous report about the cysteine level in mature leaves . the glutathione levels of the two knockout mutants were comparable to the wild type and complementation lines similar to the stable glutathione levels in both mutant seeds and mature leaves reported for the same mutant . when sulfate availability was reduced to the cysteine level was significantly reduced in the mutant shoots compared with that in the wild type and the complementation line . under the same conditions a reduced glutathione level did not show a statistically significant difference between the mutant and the wild type and the line . when reducing sulfate to the cysteine level was further _PROTEIN_ but no significant difference was observed between the mutant and the wild type . however the complementation line remained at a higher level probably due to the overexpression of . the glutathione level was not significantly different between the mutant and the wild type but levels in both were significantly lower than the complementation line .
