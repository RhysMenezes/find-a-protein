iron is an essential micronutrient for humans . fe deficiency disease is widespread and has led to extensive studies on the _METHOD_ of fe uptake and storage especially in staple food crops such as rice . however studies of functionally related genes in rice and other crops are often time and space demanding . here we demonstrate that transgenic arabidopsis suspension culture cells and arabidopsis plants can be used as an efficient _PROTEIN_ system for gain of function study of selected transporters using fe transporters as a proof of principle . the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ transporters and have been described to be important for iron sequestration and disruption of these two genes leads to fe accumulation in rice seeds . in this study we have taken advantage of the _METHOD_ tagged protein _METHOD_ which functionally complements the fe hypersensitivity of _PROTEIN_ yeast mutant to generate transgenic arabidopsis suspension cell lines and plants . _METHOD_ was shown to localize on the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ using confocal microscopy and immunogold em . more importantly the fe concentration as well as the concentration of zn in the transgenic cell lines and plants were significantly increased compared to that in the wt . taken together our study shows that the heterologous _PROTEIN_ of rice _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ transporter in arabidopsis system is functional and effectively enhances iron accumulation indicating an useful approach for studying other putative transporters of crop plants in this system .
as the basis for further study we first wished to confirm the function of and to find out whether the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ tag would affect its function . in previous studies the yeast complementation assay has been widely used to confirm the function of multiple transporters . here we amplified the full length generated a _METHOD_ fused construct and _PROTEIN_ the constructs with insertions of and _METHOD_ into the yeast mutant which is sensitive to high amount of _LOCATION_ iron . as shown in fig . on the plate without any extra fe the yeast with all constructs grew normally . however on the medium with extra mm the _PROTEIN_ mutant with the empty vector failed to survive while overexpression of could largely rescue the sensitivity of the mutant . this result is consistent with the previous study . more importantly both overexpression of _METHOD_ and alone showed similar growth no matter in wild type or mutant background . _METHOD_ fusion protein also rescued the lethal phenotype of the _PROTEIN_ mutant on the media with extra fe . the result showed that the fusion protein _METHOD_ could complement the yeast mutant and still function as an iron transporter . we further checked the localization of _METHOD_ in yeast cells using confocal microscopy . as shown in fig . after h induction _METHOD_ localized to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ in yeast which is consistent with the localization of arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis protoplast . the result is consistent with previous reports indicating that the _LOCATION_ localization of _PROTEIN_ homologs in different _METHOD_ is conserved . next we utilized the convenient transient _PROTEIN_ system in protoplasts to confirm the localization of the fusion protein in plant cells . here in our system and consistent with previous reports _METHOD_ showed clear tonoplast localization in arabidopsis protoplasts . interestingly some punctate signals were observed in the protoplasts which partially colocalized with the prevacuolar compartment marker _PROTEIN_ indicating that is transported through the pvc to the _LOCATION_ similar to _PROTEIN_ . the other punctate signals that were not colocalized with pvc might represent the _LOCATION_ complex and trans _LOCATION_ network along the secretory pathway . we further transiently _PROTEIN_ the fusion protein _METHOD_ in rice protoplasts . as shown in fig . about h after transfection _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ showed punctate signals which colocalized with _PROTEIN_ . interestingly h after transfection a clear tonoplast pattern could be observed in the protoplasts together with the remaining punctate signals representing the pvc . taken together these data showed that _METHOD_ has the same localization to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ in both rice and arabidopsis protoplasts . next we generated stable transgenic arabidopsis cell lines with overexpressed _METHOD_ using an agrobacterium transformation mediated method . the cell lines were first subjected to confocal microscopy to study the localization of the fusion protein . as shown in fig . the fusion protein _PROTEIN_ localized to the tonoplast plus small puncta which is consistent with previous results in protoplasts . strong _METHOD_ signals were also observed in the _LOCATION_ in some cells indicating that these cells might be in a _PROTEIN_ stage of growth and the excess proteins were being degraded in the _LOCATION_ . we further carried out a western blot analysis to monitor the protein levels in the three individual cell lines as indicated in fig . c using _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ antibodies respectively . the predicted molecular weight of the protein is around kda . as shown in fig . the _METHOD_ antibody detected both the _METHOD_ fusion protein and the degraded _METHOD_ core consistent with the confocal result . the cell line showed stronger _PROTEIN_ than the other two . we also generated antibodies using a synthetic peptide as the antigen . the result with the antibody also detected a stronger fusion protein in cell line which is consistent with the _METHOD_ antibody . in addition native _PROTEIN_ proteins could also be detected considering the high similarity between and _PROTEIN_ as indicated by the asterisk in fig . . in all these western blot analyses tubulin was used as an internal control showing the equal loading . a previous study indicated that is a functional _LOCATION_ iron transporter and can contribute to the accumulation of iron in yeast cells suggesting its conserved function in yeast and rice . our localization data also indicated that has the same localization in yeast and arabidopsis cells as that in rice . therefore we propose that could have a conserved function in the arabidopsis cells as a _LOCATION_ transporter and heterologous _PROTEIN_ of could increase the _LOCATION_ iron concentration . to verify this hypothesis we conducted inductively coupled _LOCATION_ optical emission _METHOD_ to measure the iron concentration in arabidopsis transgenic cell lines . as shown in fig . the iron concentrations in three independent cell lines was significantly increased compared to that in the wt cell line . this result indicated that overexpressed may indeed have the function of a _LOCATION_ iron transporter and could contribute to the accumulation of iron . interestingly the cell line showed the highest iron concentration compared to the other two consistent with the protein _PROTEIN_ level of in the cell lines . this result further confirmed the positive correlation between the increase in iron concentration and the _PROTEIN_ level of . in addition zn concentration also showed a similar increased pattern with fe consistent with the previous study showing and could also function to transport zn and mn . here however mn concentration showed a slight _PROTEIN_ . the concentration of cu also showed obvious increase . at the same time we also measured the concentrations of multiple macronutrients . as shown in supplemental fig . the concentration of p showed an obvious increase in the transgenic cell lines while ca and mg showed a slight _PROTEIN_ . taken together these results indicated that overexpressed in arabidopsis cells indeed function to transport fe and increases the accumulation of iron and other micronutrients like zn . we further generated the transgenic arabidopsis plants that stably _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ under the promoter . similarly the plants were first subjected to confocal microscopy for localization studies . consistent with our previous results the _METHOD_ signal of _METHOD_ localized to the tonoplast and punctate structures as shown in fig . . to detect the protein _PROTEIN_ levels in the transgenic arabidopsis plants we extracted total proteins from three independent lines and detected the fusion proteins using _METHOD_ antibodies . as shown in fig . the transgenic lines and showed stronger _PROTEIN_ than . in this western blot analysis ponceau s staining was used as an internal control showing the equal loading . we also performed an immunogold electron microscopy study with these transgenic plants . the samples were fixed by high pressure freezing and labeled using _METHOD_ antibodies . figure shows the wild type arabidopsis plant under the electron microscopy . as shown in fig . i the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ was labeled by the gold particles further confirming the tonoplast localization of _METHOD_ . interestingly gold particles were also found on pvc as indicated with asterisks in fig . which represents the punctate signals and is consistent with the colocalization between _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in fig . . to investigate whether _METHOD_ could function similarly in arabidopsis plants as that in the suspension cells we further measured the iron concentration in plant tissues . as shown in fig . a significant increase in fe concentration was observed in transgenic arabidopsis silique tissues compared to the wt . this result is consistent with that in suspension cells indicating that _METHOD_ indeed functions in arabidopsis plants . interestingly both mn and zn concentrations were also increased while no obvious change in cu was observed . as shown in supplemental fig . the result with stem tissues revealed a similar pattern . macronutrients were also measured in the experiments . for the concentrations of ca mg and p only one transgenic line showed a slight increase in the stem while the other two lines showed no significant change . to have a better picture of the function of we further supplied extra fe to the wild type and transgenic plants with highest fe accumulation and compared iron accumulation . as shown in fig . c fe and zn concentrations were increased when supplied with extra fe in both wt and transgenic arabidopsis siliques while transgenic plants show a more obvious increase than the wt plants . surprisingly mn concentration is _PROTEIN_ when supplied with extra fe . the result in the stem is similar to that in the silique . for cu and the other macronutrients like ca p and mg the concentration did not show an obvious change with extra fe supply .
