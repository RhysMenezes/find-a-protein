the organization of plant microtubule arrays is thought to be regulated by phosphorylation and other signaling cascades but the molecular components involved are largely unknown . we have previously found that a dominant missense mutation _PROTEIN_ in a putative kinase docking motif of an arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ phosphatase which belongs to the mitogen activated protein kinase phosphatase _PROTEIN_ family compromises the stability of cortical microtubules . we here report that suppressor screening of _PROTEIN_ recovered several intragenic recessive mutations in _PROTEIN_ . in contrast to our previous report null alleles of _PROTEIN_ were almost indistinguishable from the wild type in morphology but their roots skewed to the abnormal direction when grew in the presence of low doses of a microtubule destabilizing drug . _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in elongating cells where the protein was distributed in the cytoplasm predominantly in a microsomal fraction . recruitment of green _METHOD_ protein tagged _PROTEIN_ in endomembrane aggregates after treatment with brefeldin a or in an endomembrane organization mutant suggests that an association with endomembranes retains _PROTEIN_ in the cytoplasm . a _LOCATION_ export signal identified in the c terminal tail also contributes to the robust cytoplasmic retention of _PROTEIN_ .
we first screened populations with mutagenized _PROTEIN_ in the presence of propyzamide a microtubule destabilizing agent for suppressors that showed substantial root growth . thirteen suppressors contained mutations within the _PROTEIN_ gene and thus were putative intragenic suppressors . likely null alleles _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ respectively had a mutation at the splicing acceptor junction and a premature stop codon in the middle region and lacked large parts of _PROTEIN_ including the phosphatase domain . the mutants showed efficient suppression of the _PROTEIN_ phenotypes and grew like wild type plants . other mutants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ had exchanges of amino acids in the regions conserved between arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ and its putative rice orthologs and may be functionally important . we next obtained three new t dna insertion alleles _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and a transposon insertion allele _PROTEIN_ from arabidopsis stock centers . the previously reported t dna insertion allele _PROTEIN_ was initially embryonic lethal in the homozygous state but repeated backcrossing to the wild type yielded a homozygous line which grew normally . we speculate that another mutation genetically linked to the _PROTEIN_ locus was responsible for the embryonic lethality observed in the original _PROTEIN_ plants . since these four putative null alleles of _PROTEIN_ gave similar wild type like phenotypes we chose the _PROTEIN_ allele for further characterization . immunoblot analysis with an anti _PROTEIN_ antibody showed that no _PROTEIN_ protein was detectable in the cell extract of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ seedlings confirming that these _PROTEIN_ mutants are null alleles . in the presence of propyzamide at concentrations of wild type roots slanted to the left while the growth of _PROTEIN_ roots was severely inhibited . the _PROTEIN_ roots were indistinguishable from the wild type roots in the absence of the drug but in the presence of propyzamide at grew significantly more slowly than wild type roots . at the growth of the _PROTEIN_ roots on the hard agar slanted to the right the opposite direction to the wild type skewing when viewed from above . the same results were obtained for another null allele _PROTEIN_ . thus null alleles of _PROTEIN_ are almost indistinguishable from the wild type with a conditional phenotype reminiscent of a slightly compromised organization of cortical microtubules . to examine the tissue and cell type specificity of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ we inserted the _PROTEIN_ gene just before the stop codon of the kb _PROTEIN_ gene containing a kb upstream region and a kb downstream region and introduced the reporter construct into wild type arabidopsis plants . when the gus activity was histochemically stained for min the strongest staining was observed at the root tip of light grown seedlings . longer incubation for h revealed that expanding young true leaves and the base of hypocotyls were also stained as well as faint staining in cotyledons . the gus activity was observed in the etiolated hypocotyl of dark grown seedlings days after germination where rapidly elongating regions shifted from the basal region to the apical region . the gus staining maximum was seen in the basal region at dag shifted to the middle of hypocotyls at dag and was observed in the uppermost region at dag . in mature plants the gus activity was seen in restricted tissues such as the stigma the anther the receptacle and base of the pedicel . the gus staining patterns indicate that strong _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is partly correlated with rapid cell elongation . to study the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ we inserted _METHOD_ just before the stop codon of _PROTEIN_ in the kb genomic region that was used for the gene _PROTEIN_ analysis and introduced it into the wild type or _PROTEIN_ arabidopsis plants . genomic regions of the wild type _PROTEIN_ gene and the _PROTEIN_ gene with the _PROTEIN_ mutation were used and the respective transgenic lines are referred to as _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ . several independent transgenic lines were established for both constructs and results for representative lines are shown here . when _METHOD_ was _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ the transgenic plants fully complemented the root twisting and propyzamide hypersensitive phenotypes of _PROTEIN_ . when introduced into the wild type plants the _METHOD_ plants were morphologically indistinguishable from wild type plants whereas the _METHOD_ plants reproduced a weak left handed helical growth phenotype and propyzamide hypersensitivity as seen in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . these results indicate that the _METHOD_ fusion proteins are functional . figure shows confocal images of the root where _METHOD_ signals were excluded from the _LOCATION_ and the _LOCATION_ . in _METHOD_ cells _METHOD_ signals were distributed uniformly in the cytoplasm while the cytoplasmic distribution of _METHOD_ was somewhat uneven with occasional foci of stronger _METHOD_ signals . to examine whether _PROTEIN_ is associated with endomembranes in the cytoplasm we prepared microsomal and soluble protein fractions from _METHOD_ plants . immunoblot analysis showed that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was abundant in the microsomal fraction compared to the soluble fraction . this distribution pattern was similar to that of the tonoplast localized v _PROTEIN_ and differed from that of the soluble phosphoenolpyruvate _PROTEIN_ . when arabidopsis roots were treated with brefeldin a _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was partially associated with the bfa bodies . recruitment to the bfa bodies was clearly seen in the bfa treated root cells of _METHOD_ plants . we also _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein transiently in the epidermal cells of the _PROTEIN_ mutant which was defective in the organization of endomembranes and observed that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ accumulated in large aggregates of endomembranes and was excluded from the _LOCATION_ . these results collectively indicate that _PROTEIN_ is a cytoplasmic phosphatase and is weakly or transiently associated with endomembranes and that the mutation may enhance the association . in addition to its association with endomembranes _PROTEIN_ may use other strategies to be retained in the cytoplasm . to explore the possibility that _PROTEIN_ may be actively excluded from the _LOCATION_ we examined the presence of _LOCATION_ export signals in _PROTEIN_ . in our transient assays test proteins were fused to _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ in protoplasts from leaf mesophyll cells . the gus _METHOD_ control protein was found in the cytoplasm but when a _LOCATION_ localization signal was fused to gus _METHOD_ it was efficiently transported to the _LOCATION_ . as in the stable transformants _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was distributed in the cytoplasm . interestingly addition of the functional nls to _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ did not result in efficient relocalization of the nls containing protein to the _LOCATION_ indicating that an active mechanism competes with the nls mediated _LOCATION_ targeting and mostly retains _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ nls in the cytoplasm . when protoplasts were treated with nm leptomycin b an inhibitor of arabidopsis exportin _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ nls and _METHOD_ nls _PROTEIN_ nes were effectively retained in the _LOCATION_ whereas _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was not . therefore _PROTEIN_ contains a cryptic nes that is normally masked by a lmb independent cytoplasmic retention mechanism . to identify this cryptic nes in _PROTEIN_ we tested various deletion mutants of _PROTEIN_ that were all fused to the nls containing _METHOD_ . first when n terminal central and c terminal fragments of _PROTEIN_ were tested only the c terminal fragment fused to _METHOD_ nls was excluded from the _LOCATION_ . next the c terminal region containing the _PROTEIN_ phosphatase domain was further truncated at either its n terminus or c terminus . the smallest _PROTEIN_ fusion construct that was excluded from the _LOCATION_ was _PROTEIN_ which contained a part of the phosphatase domain and the c terminal tail . a further truncated version _PROTEIN_ was retained in the _LOCATION_ indicating that the c terminal tail of amino acid residues was necessary for the nes activity . we then manually inspected the c terminal tail for the presence of a putative nes sequence and found that the sequence in _PROTEIN_ largely _METHOD_ to the nes consensus sequence l x x l x where x represents any two or three amino acids except proline . when two leucine residues predicted to be important for ness were simultaneously mutated to alanines in _PROTEIN_ the mutated _PROTEIN_ fragment was retained in the _LOCATION_ . furthermore when the same mutations were introduced into the full length _PROTEIN_ the la mutant version of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ nls was efficiently recruited to the _LOCATION_ . however when the exogenous nls motif was not added the la mutant of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was predominantly found in the cytoplasm . these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ is normally retained in the cytoplasm by an nes independent mechanism and that the cryptic nes in the c terminal tail functions when _PROTEIN_ is recruited to the _LOCATION_ to ensure a constant and robust cytoplasmic distribution .
