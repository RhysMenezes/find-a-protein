fusarium head blight _PROTEIN_ or scab is one of the most important plant diseases worldwide affecting wheat barley and other small grains . trichothecene mycotoxins such as deoxynivalenol accumulate in the grain presenting a food safety risk and health hazard to humans and animals . despite considerable breeding efforts highly resistant wheat or barley cultivars are not available . we screened an activation tagged arabidopsis thaliana population for resistance to trichothecin a type b trichothecene in the same class as don . here we show that one of the resistant lines identified trichothecene resistant contains a t dna insertion upstream of two nonspecific lipid transfer protein genes and . _PROTEIN_ of both nsltp genes was induced in over fold relative to wild type . overexpression of provided greater resistance to tcin than in arabidopsis thaliana and in saccharomyces cerevisiae relative to wild type or vector transformed lines suggesting a conserved protection mechanism . tcin treatment increased reactive oxygen species production in arabidopsis and ros stain was associated with the chloroplast the cell wall and the apoplast . ros levels were attenuated in arabidopsis and in yeast overexpressing relative to the controls . exogenous addition of glutathione and other antioxidants enhanced resistance of arabidopsis to tcin while the addition of buthionine sulfoximine an inhibitor of glutathione synthesis increased sensitivity suggesting that resistance was mediated by glutathione . total glutathione content was significantly higher in arabidopsis and in yeast overexpressing relative to the controls highlighting the importance of in _PROTEIN_ the redox state . these results demonstrate that trichothecenes cause ros accumulation and overexpression of protects against trichothecene induced oxidative stress by increasing the glutathione based antioxidant defense .
to investigate the _METHOD_ underlying trichothecene resistance we screened activation tagged arabidopsis thaliana seeds for resistance to tcin . this concentration of tcin was chosen because treatment of arabidopsis leaves with tcin resulted in uniform leaf bleaching in detached leaf assays and caused inhibition of root growth in germination assays and strong inhibition of vegetative growth . this concentration of tcin is also similar to the for tcin in yeast as shown in . a population of generation arabidopsis seeds transformed with the t dna vector which contains four copies of the cauliflower mosaic virus enhancer were screened . one of the resistant lines identified in our screen grew on agar containing tcin which inhibited germination and root growth of the wild type col . the untreated plants from the resistant line were indistinguishable from the untreated wild type plants . to identify the flanking sequences of the t dna insertion locus in thermal asymmetric interlaced pcr was used . sequence analysis indicated that the t dna tag was inserted into the last exon of the gene which encodes a protein of unknown function . to determine the effect of the insertion on transcription in this region _PROTEIN_ of two upstream genes and two downstream genes was analyzed using qrt pcr with primers specific for each gene . there was little difference in _PROTEIN_ of and no _PROTEIN_ was detected from or in either or in wild type . however in _PROTEIN_ of which is bp downstream of the t dna insert was induced fold and _PROTEIN_ of which is bp downstream of was induced fold relative to wild type . and encode two novel non specific lipid transfer protein genes which belong to type iv nsltps previously designated as and respectively . screening of the activation tagged arabidopsis lines identified a mutant which was able to form roots/leaves on tcin . the t dna tag was inserted into the last exon of the gene in . _PROTEIN_ analysis of the activation tagged _PROTEIN_ locus and the flanking genes and wild type arabidopsis col by qrt pcr . _PROTEIN_ levels of and were significantly higher in the activation tagged line compared to the wild type col . immunoblot analysis of total protein isolated from col and independent arabidopsis lines containing _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ separated on a _PROTEIN_ polyacrylamide gel and probed with monoclonal anti his igg followed by amersham ecl plex c anti mouse igg conjugated with and scanned using the typhoon _PROTEIN_ . the blot was stained with ponceau s and the kd band is shown for equal loading . analysis of rna _PROTEIN_ in two independently transformed arabidopsis lines and in the _PROTEIN_ knockout line . _LOCATION_ indicates s.e where n independent replicates . two sample unpaired t tests for equal means were performed between the different vectors containing the nsltps relative to the vector control for each toxin p < p < . to determine if overexpression of or was responsible for tcin resistance in c terminal _METHOD_ fusions of each gene were constructed and cloned downstream of the camv promoter in the pearleygate vector . arabidopsis col plants were transformed with _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ using the floral dip method . homozygous lines for each construct and the vector were identified based on segregation on media containing _PROTEIN_ . _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ overexpressing lines were phenotypically normal and indistinguishable from wild type plants . immunoblot analysis showed that _METHOD_ was _PROTEIN_ at a higher level than _METHOD_ in three independently generated transgenic lines with each vector . analysis of mrna levels in lines and by qrt pcr indicated that line showed a fold increase and line showed a fold increase in _PROTEIN_ relative to the vector control _METHOD_ . the knockout line which was phenotypically similar to wild type arabidopsis did not _PROTEIN_ . sensitivity of the transgenic lines to tcin was examined using detached leaf assays in liquid media and by germination assays on solid media . the detached leaf assay showed that the overexpressing line was partially protected from leaf bleaching caused by and tcin relative to the _METHOD_ control . the _PROTEIN_ combined knockout line did not appear to impact sensitivity to the toxin compared to the vector control . when transgenic lines were germinated on solid media containing tcin overexpressing transgenic lines and had improved germination on media containing tcin compared to _METHOD_ control . overexpressing lines were not as resistant as the overexpressing lines and were not analyzed further . the percentage of overexpressing lines able to form roots two weeks after exposure to tcin determined by counting seedlings per line and is shown in . six different transgenic lines overexpressing displayed significantly greater root growth at days after plating compared to the control . these results demonstrate that overexpressing lines show improved resistance to tcin . detached leaves overexpressing relative to _METHOD_ control and the _PROTEIN_ ko line after treatment with and tcin for h. germination of overexpressing lines and on tcin relative to the control _METHOD_ . percentage of wild type and overexpressing lines able to form roots on tcin in weeks . _LOCATION_ bars represent standard _LOCATION_ calculated from three independent experiments . one way _PROTEIN_ with post hoc bonferroni tests p < p < . analysis of transgenic arabidopsis leaves _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ by confocal microscopy revealed that the _METHOD_ signal accumulated in the cell wall and in the apoplast and _PROTEIN_ was also detected in the roots . intracellular _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ was observed in a network characteristic of the _LOCATION_ and _METHOD_ colocalized with the chloroplasts as indicated by the yellow signal . arabidopsis col transformed with the _METHOD_ vector revealed no staining around the chloroplast or the _LOCATION_ . agrobacterium mediated transient _PROTEIN_ analysis of _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ in tobacco leaves confirmed the subcellular localization observed in the transgenic plants . transient _PROTEIN_ analysis days after agrobacterium infiltration showed that _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ were localized in the _LOCATION_ space near the cell wall . _METHOD_ showed stronger _METHOD_ signal than _METHOD_ and colocalization of the _METHOD_ protein and the chloroplasts was evident by the yellow signal . confocal microscopy analysis of line _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ showing _PROTEIN_ in the cell wall/apoplast possibly in the _LOCATION_ and chloroplasts _METHOD_ control . we previously showed that trichothecenes induce mitochondrial ros accumulation in yeast and exogenous addition of antioxidants alleviate growth inhibition by trichothecenes indicating that toxicity of trichothecenes is at least partially a consequence of increased ros production . to determine if tcin treatment induces ros in arabidopsis wild type arabidopsis leaves infiltrated with tcin for h and then were stained with dichlorofluorescin diacetate a non _METHOD_ cell permeable dye which is retained intracellularly following cleavage by esterases and is converted to the highly _METHOD_ dichlorofluorescein _PROTEIN_ when oxidized by ros . confocal microscopy analysis of the mock treatment revealed very light staining without highlighting any particular structure . the tcin treatment showed that _PROTEIN_ stain colocalized with chloroplasts the cell wall and possibly the apoplast . increasing the dosage of tcin to intensified the _PROTEIN_ staining of chloroplasts relative to the mock treatment . similar results were obtained when tobacco leaves were treated with don . the mock treatment revealed very light staining without highlighting any particular structure in tobacco . the hour treatment of tobacco leaves with don revealed colocalization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ with chloroplasts . increasing the concentration of don to intensified the staining of chloroplasts . disorganized chlorophyll _METHOD_ was detected in leaf tissues treated with don for . similarly treatment with nm paraquat led to oxidative damage of chloroplast _LOCATION_ and ultimately to bursting of the chloroplast . confocal microscopy analysis of ros accumulation in wild type arabidopsis leaves infiltrated with tcin and the cell permeable fluorogenic probe dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate _PROTEIN_ after h. mock treatment with buffer treatment with tcin treatment with tcin . intact leaf assay to quantify levels in transgenic arabidopsis lines and overexpressing using amplex red . treatment with tcin for h induced accumulation in the vector control _METHOD_ but not in lines and . _LOCATION_ bars indicate s.e where n independent replicates . one way _PROTEIN_ with post hoc bonferroni tests p < . we investigated if treatment of wild type arabidopsis leaves with antioxidants would protect against tcin arabidopsis leaves were treated with tcin in the presence of mm vitamin c vitamin e or para amino benzoic acid _PROTEIN_ . treatment with antioxidants partially protected against the bleaching effects of tcin . incubation of arabidopsis col seedlings with liquid _METHOD_ media containing tcin revealed photobleaching after h h dark treatment . in contrast continuous dark treatment provided protection from photobleaching caused by tcin . these results showed that tcin treatment induces ros accumulation in arabidopsis and provided evidence that ros accumulation and light play a role in tcin mediated tissue damage . to determine if tcin treatment leads to ros accumulation in transgenic arabidopsis overexpressing intact leaves from _METHOD_ control plants and from overexpressing lines and were exposed to and tcin incubated for h and levels were quantified with amplex red ultra . a significant increase in was observed when the _METHOD_ control line was treated with tcin relative to the mock treatment . in contrast level did not increase when overexpressing lines were treated with tcin . the level in lines and was significantly lower relative to the control line _METHOD_ after exposure to tcin . these results indicate that overexpression of attenuates tcin induced ros accumulation . to determine if nsltp overexpression provided resistance to trichothecenes in saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast cells overexpressing or were grown on increasing concentrations of type a or type b trichothecenes and average values were determined . the of yeast _PROTEIN_ was significantly higher relative to cells carrying the empty vector when grown on t toxin das tcin or don while yeast _PROTEIN_ showed significant resistance to only t toxin . to determine if the ability to confer tcin resistance is specific to and we investigated whether _PROTEIN_ which belongs to type i group mediates resistance to tcin . the of yeast _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ for tcin was similar to the vector control indicating that _PROTEIN_ did not protect yeast against tcin . we previously showed that treatment with type a and type b trichothecenes caused a dose dependent increase in ros production in yeast . these findings prompted us to explore ros generation in nsltp _PROTEIN_ yeast treated with trichothecenes . ros levels were measured using the ros sensitive stain _PROTEIN_ da which only fluoresces upon contact with ros . while of the untreated vector control cells stained positive for ros this increased to with t with das with tcin and with don treatment . basal ros levels were lower in and overexpressing cells relative to the vector control across the eight different trichothecene treatments . ros positive cells dropped to upon t treatment upon das treatment upon tcin treatment and upon don treatment in yeast overexpressing arabidopsis nsltps . these results demonstrate that ros generation triggered by trichothecenes is attenuated when arabidopsis nsltps are _PROTEIN_ in yeast . trichothecene treated or untreated wild type yeast cells carrying the empty vector overexpressing or overexpressing were stained for ros using dchf and analyzed by flow cytometry . _PROTEIN_ with post hoc bonferroni tests p < p < . gsh and gssg levels were quantified relative to vector control and normalized to total protein in yeast _PROTEIN_ and after hour galactose induction . _PROTEIN_ with post hoc bonferroni tests p < p < . glutathione is a major antioxidant within cells and is known to play a key role in the _PROTEIN_ of the redox status and the protection against oxidative stress by detoxifying . as shown in addition of mm cysteine or gsh did not have an effect on germination percentage of _METHOD_ control line in the absence of tcin but significantly enhanced germination percentage of _METHOD_ line in the presence of the toxin relative to _METHOD_ line treated with tcin alone . addition of mm cysteine which is a component of gsh has been reported to increase the gsh content of arabidopsis by fold . to determine if gsh is an essential mediator of resistance to tcin we explored the relationship between gsh levels and trichothecene sensitivity . germination of wild type arabidopsis was examined on plates containing buthionine sulfoximine a potent inhibitor of gsh synthesis which causes gsh depletion . bso treatment significantly enhanced the sensitivity of wild type arabidopsis to a low dose of tcin which did not affect sensitivity in the absence of bso . these results suggested that preventing gsh depletion would lead to protection against tcin . germination of _METHOD_ seedlings using media supplemented with mm cysteine or glutathione and tcin . comparison of the effect of the addition of cys and gsh with tcin to the tcin treatment alone using _PROTEIN_ with post hoc bonferroni tests p < . germination assay of _METHOD_ seedlings on media supplemented with buthionine sulfoximine and tcin . unlike tcin which substantially reduces the germination percentage tcin did not impact germination percentage . comparison of the effect of bso treatment on tcin treated or untreated samples using _PROTEIN_ with post hoc bonferroni tests p < . gsh and gssg levels of mature leaves from overexpressing line and _METHOD_ control . _PROTEIN_ with post hoc bonferroni tests p < . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in lines overexpressing relative to _METHOD_ line by qrt pcr . we examined the effect of overexpression on the glutathione level in transgenic plants by measuring the gsh and gssg content of leaves from line using the gsh glo glutathione assay kit . overexpression of resulted in a significant increase in reduced glutathione and a increase in glutathione disulfide in line compared to the vector control . total gsh content was significantly higher in line relative to the vector control . to determine if gsh biosynthesis is increased in transgenic plants we examined the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ which encodes glutamate cysteine ligase an enzyme that catalyzes the first and rate limiting step of glutathione biosynthesis in the chloroplast . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was not significantly higher in transgenic lines and overexpressing suggesting that the increase in gsh level was not due to the overexpression of _PROTEIN_ . to determine if overexpression of arabidopsis nsltps affected the gsh level in yeast the gsh and gssg content of yeast cells _PROTEIN_ and was analyzed using the gsh glo glutathione assay kit . reduced gsh level was significantly higher in yeast _PROTEIN_ and . however yeast _PROTEIN_ only showed a significant increase in the gssg level and in the total gsh level relative to yeast harboring the vector but not yeast _PROTEIN_ . these results demonstrated that the increase observed in the total glutathione content in the overexpressing arabidopsis line translated to yeast .
