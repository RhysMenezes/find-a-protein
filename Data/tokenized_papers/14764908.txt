lipoic acid dependent pathways of keto acid oxidation by mitochondria were investigated in pea rice and arabidopsis . proteins containing covalently bound lipoic acid were identified on isoelectric focusing/sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis separations of mitochondrial proteins by the use of antibodies raised to this cofactor . all these proteins were identified by tandem _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . lipoic acid containing acyltransferases from pyruvate dehydrogenase complex and ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex were identified from all three species . in addition acyltransferases from the branched chain dehydrogenase complex were identified in both arabidopsis and rice mitochondria . the substrate dependent reduction of nad was analyzed by spectrophotometry using specific keto acids . pyruvate and ketoglutarate dependent reactions were measured in all three species . activity of the branched chain dehydrogenase complex was only measurable in arabidopsis mitochondria using substrates that represented the keto acids derived by deamination of branched chain amino acids . the rate of branched chain amino acid and keto acid dependent oxygen consumption by intact arabidopsis mitochondria was highest with val and the val derived keto acid ketoisovaleric acid . sequencing of peptides derived from trypsination of arabidopsis mitochondrial proteins revealed the presence of many of the enzymes required for the oxidation of all three branched chain amino acids . the potential role of branched chain amino acid catabolism as an oxidative phosphorylation energy source or as a detoxification pathway during plant stress is discussed .
a number of the putative lipoyl containing proteins predicted from plant genome sequencing have very similar molecular _METHOD_ . as a consequence their presence could not be differentiated readily by one dimensional _PROTEIN_ using antibodies raised against lipoic acid . however after two dimensional isoelectric focusing /sds _PROTEIN_ a large series of protein spots immunoreactive to antilipoic acid antibodies were detected in mitochondrial samples from pea rice and arabidopsis . these proteins were excised from gels and identified by _METHOD_ . identification of lipoic acid containing proteins in plant mitochondria protein spots from figure were identified by _METHOD_ spot no. accession no . of matching gene description of matching gene and the apparent molecular _METHOD_ of the match and the experimental proteins are shown . the quality of the _METHOD_ match is shown by the mowse score from mascot matching percentage coverage of the match protein sequence by the peptides identified and the number of matching peptides _PROTEIN_ . searches were performed with _METHOD_ tolerance of d and _METHOD_ tolerance of d. arabidopsis and rice proteins were all matched to genes from the same species . pea peptides were matched with identical peptides in several other species . the complement of prominent lipoic acid proteins in pea mitochondria has been well studied and includes an kd subunit of pdc a kd subunit of pdc and a kd subunit of kgdc . in pea the extra spots on either side of the _PROTEIN_ identified proteins are probably urea induced modifications of the major proteins _METHOD_ . we could not identify these addition spots because of their low abundance . the other small protein spots shown but not identified were not able to be located on the paired colloidal _METHOD_ stained gel . in rice no high molecular _METHOD_ lipoyl containing protein of to kd was present in agreement with the absence of this two lipoyl domain subunit in other monocots including maize wheat and barley . the various to kd proteins detected by the antibodies in rice included three different _METHOD_ of the one lipoyl domain pdc subunit and a single kgdc subunit . five of the protein spots in this size range _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ appeared to have been generated from a single pdc subunit gene suggesting that posttranslational modification of this gene product beyond simple lipoic acid attachment occurs . in arabidopsis mitochondria the two lipoyl domain kd subunit of pdc was readily detected and _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ revealed that it was the product of _GENE_ . a number of subunits of approximately kd were also analyzed and found to include two separate one lipoyl domain pdc subunits and the kgdc subunit . the spot was encoded by _GENE_ putatively a _LOCATION_ pdc . given the very low abundance of this protein it _METHOD_ likely that it may represent _LOCATION_ contamination _LOCATION_ . in both rice and arabidopsis one of the immunoreactive kd proteins was identified as the subunit of bckdc _PROTEIN_ . this suggested that in contrast to pea shoot mitochondria arabidopsis cell culture mitochondria and rice shoot mitochondria contain appreciable amounts of bckdc . the apparent absence of bckdc in pea leaf mitochondria may help to explain previous failures to detect bckdc activity in this tissue but is in conflict with the radiolabeled substrate tracer data from pea shoot mitochondria . consensus between these three reports may be reached by simply suggesting bckdc in pea mitochondria is very low in abundance . to further investigate the presence of bckdc in plant mitochondria we measured keto acid dependent nad reduction by mitochondrial samples from the three species . samples from all three species exhibited significant rates of pyruvate and ketoglutarate dependent nad reduction . however using three substrates for bdkdc commonly used in mammalian mitochondria only arabidopsis mitochondria catalyzed significant rates of nad reduction . these keto acids are the products of transamination reactions from the branched chain amino acids val leu and ile respectively . we also observed that bckdc activity was inhibited by inclusion of triton x in assays suggesting that there is a detergent labile step in the reaction . in contrast pdc and kgdc reactions tolerate high triton x concentrations . provision of exogenous pig to the activity assay in the presence of triton x did not recover bckdc activity suggesting that the lability was not simply caused by loss of . loss of this subunit can be a problem with assays of complexes from some organs . as a consequence bckdc activity was measured in freeze thawed mitochondrial samples in the presence of respiratory inhibitors to prevent nadh oxidation . spectrophotometric assays of pdc kgdc and bckdc in three species data represent the mean se of at least three mitochondria preparations and are _PROTEIN_ as nanomoles nadh per minute per milligram of protein . branched chain amino acid catabolism by arabidopsis mitochondria was investigated further by measuring consumption in the presence of selected substrates . the tca cycle substrates pyruvate and ketoglutarate both initiated substantial rates of consumption as expected . simple addition of other keto acids to mitochondria did not trigger any consumption . this could have been because of either the lack of transporters for these compounds or because the lack of a _LOCATION_ potential in de energized mitochondria did not allow uptake by available transporter routes . energization of the _LOCATION_ by adding a pulse of exogenous nadh allowed subsequent assessment of branched chain keto acid dependent consumption after substrate entry to the mitochondria . only the keto acid derived from val supported oxygen consumption in this assay . to assess the oxidation pathway from branched chain amino acids directly aliquots of val leu and ile were added to mitochondria during ketoglutarate oxidation by mitochondria . the availability of ketoglutarate as an amino acceptor is essential for bcat transamination of the branched chain amino acids in the first step of the pathway . we consistently observed a stimulation of ketoglutarate dependent consumption in the presence of val and leu . together these results indicate that a low but significant rate of branched chain amino acid catabolism can occur in arabidopsis mitochondria . consumption by amino acids and branched chain acids in arabidopsis data represent the mean se of at least three mitochondria preparations and are _PROTEIN_ as nanomoles per minute per milligram of protein . the experimental data presented in tables ii and iii demonstrate some level of amino acid catabolism in isolated mitochondria but they do not show that this process continues to completion to yield acetyl coa or propionyl coa . convincing evidence that a leu pathway exists in vivo has been presented previously in tracer experiments however similar experiments have not been carried out examining the val or ile pathways in plant mitochondria . the most pressing issue now is to identify the genes encoding the proteins involved in these pathways in plant mitochondria and to assess the presence of components unique to the val and ile catabolism . in total different enzymes or enzyme complexes are involved in the pathways for val leu and ile metabolism and sequence similarity searches of the arabidopsis genome revealed that multigene families exist for most enzymes . a total of arabidopsis genes encoding proteins with similarity to these enzymes or subunits were found . proteomic analysis of arabidopsis mitochondria by lc _METHOD_ showed that only of these genes encode the enzymes present in mitochondrial preparations from arabidopsis cell cultures . as noted earlier these arabidopsis mitochondrial preparations are known to contain a small amount of _LOCATION_ and peroxisomal contamination and the possibility that some of these identifications might result from the presence of abundant proteins from other cellular locations can not be ruled out . identification of leu ile and val catabolism enzymes in arabidopsis mitochondria lc _METHOD_ analysis of peptides derived from trypsination of total mitochondrial proteins . gene name and description are shown along with the matched sequence the proid score of the match the _METHOD_ of the experimental identified peptides _METHOD_ and the difference between this _METHOD_ and the matched peptide theoretical _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . other reports of these proteins in mitochondria from arabidopsis are fujiki et al . millar et al . kruft et al . sweetlove et al . daschner et al . and che et al . . there are five enzymes common to the initial stages of catabolism of all three branched chain amino acids the transaminase bckdc _PROTEIN_ enoyl coa hydratase and the etf accepting electrons from _PROTEIN_ . peptide sequences corresponding to each of these proteins were obtained from the cell culture mitochondria . we have reported sequences for some of these proteins previously from two dimensional gel separations of arabidopsis mitochondria and some have been found in mitochondria from other plant species whereas six represent novel identifications of proteins localized to mitochondria . the bcat identified here as mitochondrial has been ascribed to the _LOCATION_ previously on the basis of _METHOD_ tagging of the presequence and it is possible that _LOCATION_ contamination of the mitochondrial samples we used for proteomic analysis accounts for our identification of it . however this protein may represent a genuinely dual targeted protein localized to both organelles by an ambiguous targeting presequence or as shown for other dual localized proteins alternative transcription start sites . however the different results may also reflect the different tissue types used or the involvement of the passenger protein _METHOD_ in protein targeting . further experimentation is required to resolve the in vivo location of this gene product . leu metabolism proceeds by an intermediary step catalyzed by _PROTEIN_ before e coah formation and we were able to identify the subunit of this enzyme in arabidopsis mitochondria from an ief/sds _PROTEIN_ separated gel spot . the presence of both the and subunit for the mitochondrial _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis also has been reported previously by che et al. . after e coah formation the hydroxy acyl coas branch to form separate catabolic pathways for the three branched chain amino acids . a single lyase step splits hydroxylmethylglutaryl coa to yield acetoacetate and acetyl coa in the final step of leu catabolism . notably a single copy of this enzyme is encoded in arabidopsis and is predicted to be mitochondrial targeted by targetp predotar and mitoprotii . we identified peptides matching _GENE_ in our lc _METHOD_ experiments . although we have no convincing _METHOD_ evidence for the presence of the next step in ile metabolism or the next two steps in val metabolism in mitochondria we were able to obtain _METHOD_ matches corresponding to the enzymes catalyzing the final step in each pathway . val metabolism proceeds by hib coah and hibdh . the first of these enzymes is probably peroxisomal in arabidopsis and mutation of the primary isoform _PROTEIN_ leads to both impaired val catabolism and fatty acid oxidation . the hib coah protein sequences in arabidopsis all have _PROTEIN_ like peroxisomal targeting sequences at the c termini . the localization of hibdh in arabidopsis is less clear and three members of the hib coah gene family in arabidopsis encode proteins strongly predicted to be mitochondrial by multiple targeting prediction _METHOD_ but we were not able to experimentally confirm this localization . we found sequences corresponding to methylmalonate semialdehyde dehydrogenase which catalyzes the final step of val conversion to propionyl coa in our mitochondrial preparations confirming previous results . propionyl coa is subsequently converted to succinyl coa which can then enter the tca cycle . ile metabolism proceeds from hydroxy acyl coas via oxidation catalyzed by hydroxy methylbutyryl coa dehydrogenase _PROTEIN_ which is incorporated into the fatty acid multifunctional protein . in arabidopsis two _METHOD_ of multifunctional protein exist as well as a shortened form predicted by sequence similarity to only have hmb _PROTEIN_ activity . all three predicted proteins contain _PROTEIN_ like c termini strongly suggesting peroxisomal localization . the final step of ile pathway is catalyzed by acetyl coa c acetyltransferase . this ketoacyl coa thiolase has _PROTEIN_ like domains at the n terminus also suggesting a possible peroxisomal location but we found peptides from this protein in mitochondria . this enzyme was also identified as a very significant protein in arabidopsis mitochondrial preparations by kruft et al . . thus this enzyme may also be dual targeted to both organelles or there may be a mitochondrial specific isoform among the small ketoacyl coa thiolase family . the isoform found is predicted to be mitochondrial by several targeting prediction _METHOD_ . interestingly single amino acid alterations of the rat peroxisomal ketoacyl coa thiolase presequence leads to dual targeting to _LOCATION_ and mitochondria . this suggests that dual targeting of proteins containing apparently _PROTEIN_ like sequences is possible .
