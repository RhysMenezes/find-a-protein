dividing plant cells perform a remarkable task of building a new cell wall within the cytoplasm in a few minutes . a long standing paradigm _METHOD_ that this primordial cell wall known as the cell plate is generated by delivery of newly synthesized material from _LOCATION_ apparatus originated secretory vesicles . here we show that in diverse plant species cell surface material including _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ proteins cell wall components and exogenously applied endocytic tracers is rapidly delivered to the forming cell plate . importantly this occurs even when de novo protein synthesis is blocked . in addition cytokinesis specific syntaxin _PROTEIN_ as well as _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ resident proteins localize to endosomes that fuse to initiate the cell plate . the rate of endocytosis is strongly enhanced during cell plate formation and its genetic or pharmacological inhibition leads to cytokinesis defects . our results reveal that endocytic delivery of cell surface material significantly contributes to cell plate formation during plant cytokinesis .
the _METHOD_ lipophilic styryl dye has been used in a number of plant studies as an authentic in vivo endocytic marker . it labels the pm is taken up into the cell interior only by endocytosis and afterward it gradually labels the entire endosomal pathway toward the _LOCATION_ . therefore we employed for studying the dynamics of endocytosis during cytokinesis in real time . was applied to a well established tobacco bright yellow cell line transformed with a _METHOD_ fusion protein labeling microtubules in vivo facilitating visualization of the cell cycle stage . internalized in mitotic by cells and accumulated inside the spindle region within a few minutes . in telophase labeled vesicles occupied the newly available space between separating chromosomes and subsequently extensively labeled emerging cell plates from the very first signs of their appearance . also during cell plate expansion the constitutive incorporation of many stained endomembrane structures at cell plate edges was observed suggesting continuous delivery of endocytosed material . identical results were obtained in dividing root tip cells after application to arabidopsis seedlings . to test the possibility that rapid delivery of into cell plates occurs via transient connections between parental pm and the forming cell plate we performed both optical sectioning and _METHOD_ recovery after photobleaching analysis . we followed dividing cells from metaphase onward and acquired time lapse data by scanning median longitudinal sections . optical sectioning comprised of both median longitudinal and top views showed the emergence and expansion of the cell plates at the cell center without their immediate attachment to any side of the parental pm . to compare the speed of delivery to the cell plate in the case of unattached and attached cell plates we photobleached at the cell plate and followed its recovery kinetics . after complete photobleaching of at initiating cell plates in both by and arabidopsis cells a rapid reappearance of about of the initial _METHOD_ was observed at the photobleached cell plate area with a half time of s . frap analysis of cell plates attached to their parental _METHOD_ displayed a much more extensive and faster reappearance of . this result demonstrates that is typically delivered to nonattached cell plates by endocytic vesicles and not by a direct connection with the parental pm . next we performed pulse chase experiments in by cells by complete washing out of after its application . clearly labeled first the peripheries of already initiated cell plates and afterward it was distributed all along the cell plate . this shows _PROTEIN_ delivery of at the edges of the forming cell plate . furthermore _METHOD_ gradually increased on the expanding cell plate at the expense of its _METHOD_ at the pm implying active transport against a concentration gradient . together these results imply active and selective internalization as well as _PROTEIN_ delivery of the endocytic marker from the pm to forming cell plates . to investigate whether besides _LOCATION_ material _LOCATION_ fluid can also be delivered to the cell plate by endocytosis we used the _LOCATION_ impermeable pinocytic fluid phase markers alexa and lucifer yellow . strikingly we observed that both alexa and ly internalized in dividing cells and accumulated within the volume occupied by forming cell plates . again these cell plates were not attached to the parental pm . also in maize root cells ly localized to forming cell plates which were specifically marked with the callose marker aniline blue . together these results demonstrate that endocytic lipophilic and _LOCATION_ fluid phase markers are constitutively internalized and rapidly targeted into initiating and expanding cell plates . as the results with _METHOD_ endocytic markers suggested continuous delivery of cell surface derived material to the cell plate we investigated what happens to pm resident proteins during cytokinesis . for this we performed coimmunolocalization studies in arabidopsis root tips by using the cell plate marker _PROTEIN_ . all tested pm proteins including the auxin transport facilitator _PROTEIN_ the pm water channel _PROTEIN_ the integral pm protein dynamin and the brassinolide receptor _PROTEIN_ clearly localized to _PROTEIN_ labeled forming cell plates as well as _PROTEIN_ labeled endomembrane structures . these results demonstrate targeting of the pm proteins/receptors to the forming cell plate . next we tested the fate of the cw derived material during cytokinesis . early cell plates are enriched with cw pectins . however unlike the mature cws they also contain callose but hardly any cellulose . recently it has been reported that interphase maize root cells internalize pectins from parental cws . we performed a pectin immunolocalization study in both by cells and maize root cells by using different sets of antibodies specifically recognizing pectins found either exclusively in mature cws or in _LOCATION_ apparatus derived vesicles . the antibodies used include rhamnogalacturonan ii recognizing de muro formed rgii dimers crosslinked by borate diol diester recognizing partially esterified cw homogalacturonan pectins and labeling esterified homogalacturonan pectins present _PROTEIN_ within _LOCATION_ apparatus derived vesicles . remarkably the forming cell plates in both maize and by cells were strongly labeled with the rgii and antibodies rather than the antibodies . the crosslinking of rgii pectins is well known to occur exclusively within mature parental cw demonstrating that parental cw derived material gets internalized into the cell plate . in summary these results suggest that both parental pm and cw derived material is targeted to the cell plate . our results indicated that already preexisting material at the cell surface is used for cell plate formation . therefore next we investigated the contribution of de novo synthesis . cycloheximide is used generally as a potent blocker of protein synthesis . it is also highly effective in the plant _METHOD_ at a concentration for min as was demonstrated by methionine incorporation analysis in arabidopsis root cells . after application to by cells pretreated with chx for hr we found that cell plates can still be initiated and labeled by . also arabidopsis cells pretreated with chx for hr displayed cell plate initiation and localization of all tested pm proteins to _PROTEIN_ labeled forming cell plates . in addition maize root cells pretreated with chx for hr displayed forming cell plates together with cell plate targeting of rgii . these results demonstrate that cell plate initiation and localization of pm resident proteins and cw pectins to forming cell plates do not strictly depend on de novo synthesis . this further _METHOD_ that cell surface material can be used for cell plate formation . delivery of cell surface material to the cell plate likely involves endocytosis whereas newly synthesized material is supposed to arrive by _LOCATION_ apparatus dependent secretion . therefore we examined the dynamics of endosomes and _LOCATION_ apparatus during cytokinesis by using the established markers . we used by cells and arabidopsis plants transformed with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _LOCATION_ . the authenticity of endosomal and _LOCATION_ labeling in by and arabidopsis cells was thoroughly investigated and confirmed in interphase cells by using a variety of colocalization and drug studies . in dividing by and arabidopsis cells during spindle assembly the endosomes were always distributed throughout the spindle area and their apparent fusion coincided and colocalized with cell plate initiations . in contrast trans _LOCATION_ remained around the spindle apparatus and never localized into its inside space during cell plate initiation . the trans _LOCATION_ moved inward toward assembling cell plates only after cell plates were initiated and likely supplied exocytic products needed for their expansion . during these _PROTEIN_ stages endosomal and trans _LOCATION_ organization around the cell plate appeared more complex and interconnected . the secretory inhibitor bfa has been used in many studies to visualize endosomal aggregations . therefore we used bfa to better visualize endosomes and investigate whether endosomal aggregations can initiate and expand cell plates . when bfa was applied to either by or arabidopsis cells labeled endosomal aggregates _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _LOCATION_ were observed to participate both in cell plate initiation and expansion . these in vivo real time observations were further confirmed by immunolocalization studies in arabidopsis . in fixed arabidopsis roots the cis _LOCATION_ marker _PROTEIN_ and the trans _LOCATION_ network marker did not localize significantly to the _PROTEIN_ positive cell plate . however all endosomal markers tested such as _PROTEIN_ myc _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ clearly localized to the forming cell plates . to examine the localization of endosomal markers to cell plates at the substructural level we prepared ultrathin sections from high pressure fixed freeze substituted arabidopsis roots and subjected them to immunogold labeling with _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ antibodies that have been extensively tested before . this analysis showed _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ labeling at the cell plate _PROTEIN_ and associated vesicles whereas no labeling was detected when primary antibodies were omitted . quantitative evaluation of _PROTEIN_ immunogold labeling in dividing cells revealed _LOCATION_ gold particles to be targeted to the cell plate and surrounding endosomes whereas it revealed gold particles to be cytoplasmic . in the case of _PROTEIN_ immunogold labeling in dividing cells revealed gold particles to be targeted to the cell plate and surrounding endosomes whereas it revealed gold particles to be cytoplasmic . analysis of different cell plate stages revealed that both the cell plate and cell plate vesicles contained these endosomal markers during initiation and expansion of cell plates . the gold label was mostly associated with the surface of electron transparent vesicles and less with electron dense cell plate vesicles with diameters between and nm . the ultrastructural analysis shows that both cell plate _PROTEIN_ and cell plate vesicles contain endosomal markers _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . similar results were obtained when antibodies which recognize parental cw pectins were used for immunogold labeling . together these results reveal that endosomal vesicles are included in initiating and expanding cell plates whereas fusion of endomembranes labeled with a trans _LOCATION_ marker for cell plate initiation is not detected . this again highlights the involvement of endocytosis in cell plate formation . the cytokinesis specific syntaxin _PROTEIN_ is one of the best characterized mediators of vesicle fusion for cell plate formation . surprisingly not only the cell plate based but also the intracellular _PROTEIN_ signal colocalized with endosomal markers _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . the endosomal identity of the _PROTEIN_ containing intracellular structures was further confirmed by wortmannin treatment . wortmannin is known to induce the swelling of specific endosomal structures . significantly _PROTEIN_ displayed its localization on these swelled vesicles together with endosomal marker _PROTEIN_ . in the case of bfa treated cells in which the cell plates have already been initiated _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ localized to the interior of bfa compartments that fused with the edges of the cell plate . the interior of these compartments also contains endosomal markers such as _PROTEIN_ myc and recycling pm proteins such as _PROTEIN_ the pm water channel _PROTEIN_ and pm localized . in contrast _PROTEIN_ labeled cis _LOCATION_ localized to the periphery . also in maize bfa treatment induced formation of large blobs and colocalization of cw/endocytic pectin rgii and _PROTEIN_ at the expanding peripheries of the plates resembling cell plate edge bfa compartments . together these results suggest that during cytokinesis _PROTEIN_ localizes to endosomes and fusion of these endosomes initiates or expands cell plates . it has been shown that during preprophase _PROTEIN_ accumulates intracellularly and that during cytokinesis it is included in the cell plate . accordingly in premitotic cells _PROTEIN_ colocalized with endosomal _PROTEIN_ and upon bfa treatment _PROTEIN_ colocalized with internalized _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and the pm water channel _PROTEIN_ in bfa compartments that were surrounded by _PROTEIN_ labeled cis _LOCATION_ . we further confirmed endosomal localization of _PROTEIN_ by biochemical means by using protein cofractionation analysis . on sucrose gradients _PROTEIN_ cofractionated with endosomal markers _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ but not with _LOCATION_ marker . together these results demonstrate that the regulator of cell plate formation _PROTEIN_ at least partially localizes to endosomes before cell plate initiation . since our data showed that cell plate material is rapidly derived from the cell surface by endocytosis we determined the rate of endocytosis in interphase and mitotic cells by quantifying internalization in arabidopsis cells . in interphase cells internalization of was at least fold lower compared to that of cytokinetic cells . in support it has been shown that _PROTEIN_ of endosomal regulator _PROTEIN_ is upregulated during cell division . these observations show that the rate of endocytosis is cell cycle dependent and upregulated during cytokinesis . our results strongly suggest the importance of endocytosis for cell plate formation . to test this notion we examined the impact of inhibition of endocytosis on cytokinesis . the endocytic pathway can be inhibited by cold treatment wortmannin and sodium azide . all of these treatments reversibly slowed down or blocked internalization and also cell plate formation . to interfere with endocytosis more specifically we genetically manipulated _PROTEIN_ function . in mammalian cells _PROTEIN_ is required for early endosome fusion in vitro and it regulates transport between the pm and early endosomes in vivo . proper functioning of depends on its alternating _PROTEIN_ and gdp bound states . by a specific mutation can be locked in its gdp state which interferes with its function since it keeps _LOCATION_ rather than in its active state on _LOCATION_ . it has been shown before that gdp locked interferes with endocytosis . to test the effects of this genetic interference with endocytosis on cell plate formation we made a dominant negative gdp locked state _PROTEIN_ by replacing and introduced it into cowpea protoplasts and into by cells by transfection . in both cell _METHOD_ dn _PROTEIN_ appeared in _LOCATION_ and internalization was drastically reduced confirming an inhibitory effect of dn _PROTEIN_ on endocytosis . the extent of endocytosis inhibition by dn _PROTEIN_ was always correlated to its _PROTEIN_ level . to investigate the effects of dn _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ on cell plate formation in arabidopsis we attempted to obtain dn _PROTEIN_ transformed plants . we failed to recover arabidopsis plants transformed with a dn _PROTEIN_ . therefore we _PROTEIN_ dn _PROTEIN_ only within specific cell types or conditionally _PROTEIN_ . dn _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was driven by the arabidopsis ribosomal protein _PROTEIN_ promoter which is active specifically in dividing cells . _PROTEIN_ transactivated plants were selected based on their resistance to the selection marker as well as on the basis of the _PROTEIN_ of coregulated _METHOD_ which was _PROTEIN_ found in the root and shoot _METHOD_ as reported before . the positive plants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ > > dn _PROTEIN_ remained small compared to the controls even weeks after germination . in addition these plants displayed abnormalities in their root tip architecture . importantly closer examination revealed the presence of bi and multinucleate cells demonstrating cytokinesis defects . also when dn _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was induced by tamoxifen treatment endocytosis as visualized by uptake but not exocytosis was dramatically reduced . concomitantly characteristic cytokinesis defects such as the formation of partial cws and the reduction of cell plate expansion were induced . together these experiments clearly show that inhibition of endocytosis interferes with cytokinesis and cell plate formation .
