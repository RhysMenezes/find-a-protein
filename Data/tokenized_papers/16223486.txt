we investigated the fourth subgroup of arabidopsis aquaporin small and basic intrinsic proteins . when they were _PROTEIN_ in yeast _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ but not _PROTEIN_ gave water channel activity . the transient _PROTEIN_ of sips linked with green _METHOD_ protein in arabidopsis cells and the subcellular fractionation of the tissue homogenate showed their _LOCATION_ localization . the sip proteins were detected in all of the tissues except for dry seeds . histochemical analysis of promoter _PROTEIN_ fusions revealed the cell specific _PROTEIN_ of sips . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ may function as water channels in the _LOCATION_ while _PROTEIN_ might act as an _LOCATION_ channel for other small molecules or ions .
arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ have and amino acid residues respectively . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ share identity . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are and identical respectively . to _PROTEIN_ sip aquaporins in yeast we prepared three constructs and transformed them into s. cerevisiae strain which lacks endogenous functional aquaporin . to detect the translation products in the yeast transformants we prepared antibodies against an internal segment of _PROTEIN_ and the c terminal region of _PROTEIN_ . antibody to _PROTEIN_ recognized both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and was named anti _PROTEIN_ . anti _PROTEIN_ recognizes its own antigen but not _PROTEIN_ . each sip protein was detected as a band of around kda in yeast crude _LOCATION_ fractions . immunocompetition with the corresponding peptide confirmed the specificity of the antibodies . the sip proteins were examined in a large scale preparation of yeast _LOCATION_ . two immunostained bands corresponding to the monomeric and dimeric _METHOD_ of radish aquaporin were seen after _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ despite the presence of detergent however _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ gave only single monomer bands . the empty vector gave no reactive band . _LOCATION_ vesicles prepared from the yeast cells _PROTEIN_ sips were assayed for osmotic water channels by stopped flow light scattering spectrophotometry . the swelling rate of vesicles in the hypotonic solution was monitored by the _PROTEIN_ in light scattering . the vector control showed a slow influx of water into the _LOCATION_ vesicles . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ enhanced the permeability by and respectively while radish aquaporin showed the highest activity . by contrast _PROTEIN_ did not enhance the permeability . this effect was not due to the absence of _PROTEIN_ in the _LOCATION_ as its presence was confirmed by immunoblotting . in order to determine their subcellular location we prepared six fusion constructs of the sips with _METHOD_ . these constructs were transiently _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis suspension cultured cells because they are efficiently transformed by the polyethylene glycol method . with both the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ constructs the green _METHOD_ pattern had a tubular/reticular shape in the cells whereas the _METHOD_ of free _METHOD_ was dispersed throughout the _LOCATION_ . the _METHOD_ patterns of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ tagged with _METHOD_ at both the n or c termini also had tubular/reticular/sheet shapes . this shape is typical of the plant _LOCATION_ especially in suspension cultured cells . in a similar experimental system _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were shown to be localized to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ the _METHOD_ patterns of the _METHOD_ tagged sips were identical to those of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . the present results therefore strongly suggest that the three sip _METHOD_ are located in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . to examine the subcellular location of sip proteins without tags crude _LOCATION_ fractions were prepared from homogenates of the _METHOD_ of week old arabidopsis plants and subjected to equilibrium sucrose density gradient centrifugation . _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ h _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was recovered in fractions . the subunit a of _LOCATION_ h _PROTEIN_ was detected in fractions . in the presence of mg _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were recovered in fractions together with the _LOCATION_ luminal protein bip . when the _LOCATION_ bound ribosomes were removed from the rough _LOCATION_ by treatment with edta the sip peak moved to lower density fractions as did the bip peak . the release of ribosomal proteins such as and by the treatment with edta was confirmed by immunoblotting with their antibodies . these results support the _LOCATION_ localization of the sip proteins . we quantified the relative amounts of sip proteins in various organs immunochemically as shown in . both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were detected in all of the organs except for in dry seeds . substantial levels of _PROTEIN_ protein were present in the _LOCATION_ of week old roots and in the flowers . germinating seedlings contained _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ but no signal for the sips was detected in the dry seeds . the levels of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in the various organs were similar to those in the radish plant . it should be noted that the suspension cultured arabidopsis cells which were used for _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ sip fusion proteins accumulated sips and _PROTEIN_ but not _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ . we performed promoter gus analysis of the three sip genes in order to examine their tissue specific _PROTEIN_ . constructs containing the putative promoter regions were fused in frame with the gus gene . arabidopsis plants were grown for weeks and stained for gus . the pattern of gus staining varied with the isogenes . there was strong gus activity from the _PROTEIN_ construct in the roots and rosette leaves . within the latter activity was especially high in trichome cells . gus activity from _PROTEIN_ was observed particularly in the cotyledons as well as in the minor veins and hydathode cells of the rosette leaves . strong staining was also observed in the cotyledons of plantlets _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ gus construct . in contrast to _PROTEIN_ this construct gave rise to strong activity in the _PROTEIN_ veins of the rosette leaves . for roots gus activity was especially high in the dividing cells and elongating regions of the root tips and in the emerging _PROTEIN_ roots . gus activity was in all cases detected in the stele which is the central vascular cylinder of the roots . gus activities in the flowers and siliques prepared from week old plants are also shown . for _PROTEIN_ strong gus activity was detected in the vascular tissues of the flower _PROTEIN_ stigma stamens and pollen . in the siliques the top and bottom were also strongly stained . for _PROTEIN_ the same tissues were stained although the intensity was weaker than for _PROTEIN_ . in contrast to these two genes weak gus activity from _PROTEIN_ was detected in the filaments of the stamens the upper part of the styles the vascular tissue of the _PROTEIN_ and the receptacles of the siliques but not in the anthers or pollen .
