within the leaf of an angiosperm the vascular system is constructed in a complex network pattern called venation . the formation of this vein pattern has been widely studied as a paradigm of tissue pattern formation in plants . to elucidate the molecular mechanism controlling the vein patterning process we previously isolated arabidopsis mutants to _PROTEIN_ which show a discontinuous vein pattern . here we report the phenotypic analysis of the _PROTEIN_ mutant in relation to auxin signaling and _PROTEIN_ transport and the molecular characterization of the _PROTEIN_ gene and protein . double mutant analyses with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and mp and physiological analyses using the auxin inducible marker gus and an auxin transport inhibitor indicated that _PROTEIN_ may be involved in auxin signal transduction but not in _PROTEIN_ auxin transport . positional cloning identified _PROTEIN_ as a gene that encodes an adenosine diphosphate ribosylation _PROTEIN_ guanosine triphosphatase _PROTEIN_ activating protein . it resembles animal acaps and contains four domains a bar domain a pleckstrin homology domain an arf gap domain and an ankyrin _PROTEIN_ repeat domain . recombinant _PROTEIN_ protein showed _PROTEIN_ activating activity and a specific affinity for phosphatidylinositols . this protein can self associate through the n terminal bar domain in the yeast two hybrid system . subcellular localization analysis by double staining for venus tagged _PROTEIN_ and several green _METHOD_ protein tagged intracellular markers indicated that _PROTEIN_ is located in a subpopulation of the trans _LOCATION_ network . our results indicate that the _PROTEIN_ of this gene is induced by auxin and positively regulated by _PROTEIN_ itself and that a specific acap type of arf gap functions in vein pattern formation by regulating auxin signaling via a tgn mediated vesicle transport system .
the cotyledon of arabidopsis has a very simple vein pattern one midvein and three or four _PROTEIN_ veins . taking this pattern as an index we isolated to _PROTEIN_ mutants . the _PROTEIN_ mutant has a discontinuous vascular network in cotyledons with no significant effect on the overall architecture of the vascular pattern and the leaves did not show obvious variability in their architecture within and between plants . in _PROTEIN_ rosette leaves minor veins also show severe discontinuity which varies from leaf to leaf . to understand the function of _PROTEIN_ in vascular pattern formation we first examined the relationship between _PROTEIN_ and auxin by generating the double mutants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mp . for this purpose we used the phenotypes of weak alleles to detect genetic interaction easily . about half the _PROTEIN_ seedlings produced fused cotyledons and the midvein was occasionally furcated . in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant about half the seedlings produced fused cotyledons and the cotyledon contained a single or furcated midvein . the _PROTEIN_ veins of the cotyledons were fragmented in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant . this additive phenotype suggests that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ could be independently responsible for vascular formation . about half the _PROTEIN_ seedlings produced fused cotyledons similar to those of the _PROTEIN_ mutant and the _PROTEIN_ cotyledons had irregularly concentrated vascular tissues . in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant about half the seedlings produced fused cotyledons that contained a single midvein and fragmented _PROTEIN_ veins . _PROTEIN_ veins of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ cotyledons were more fragmented than those of _PROTEIN_ and no concentrated vascular tissues were observed . the architecture of the venation was similar to that of the _PROTEIN_ mutant . rosette leaves of the _PROTEIN_ mutant have concentrated vascular tissues with an increased number of trachery elements . this phenotype was also observed in rosette leaves treated with an auxin transport inhibitor . the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant produced rosette leaves similar to those of the _PROTEIN_ mutant suggesting that the concentrated vascular pattern induced in the _PROTEIN_ mutant is suppressed by the _PROTEIN_ mutation . the _PROTEIN_ gene encodes an auxin response _PROTEIN_ that mediates auxin signaling _PROTEIN_ . to examine the genetic interaction between the _PROTEIN_ and mp mutations we generated _PROTEIN_ mp double mutants . the mp mutants usually produce a secondary vein in the cotyledons whereas the double mutants did not . in an extreme case no midvein was formed . these results suggest that the _PROTEIN_ mutation enhances the effects of the _PROTEIN_ mutation . to further investigate the relationship between _PROTEIN_ function and _PROTEIN_ auxin transport in vein pattern formation we treated the _PROTEIN_ plants with the auxin transport inhibitor n naphthylphthalamic acid . in the first node leaves of wild type plants vascular differentiation was enhanced along the entire lamina margin and the marginal vascular tissues were connected to the central vascular tissues with an increased number of non branched vascular tissues . these effects depended on npa concentration . in the first node leaves of the _PROTEIN_ mutant grown with npa vascular formation was enhanced and the vasculature was fragmented . however the overall pattern was the same as that of wild type plants treated with npa . similar effects were observed in the _PROTEIN_ leaves treated with triiodobenzoic acid . these results suggest that the effects of the auxin transport inhibitor and the _PROTEIN_ mutation are additive in the formation of the venation pattern in the arabidopsis leaf . thereafter _PROTEIN_ probably acts independently of _PROTEIN_ auxin transport in vascular pattern formation although we can not exclude the possibility that _PROTEIN_ functions in the _PROTEIN_ auxin transport system . brefeldin a prevents the _PROTEIN_ transport of _PROTEIN_ protein to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ by inhibiting the activation of _PROTEIN_ arf gef . in wild type plants grown with bfa the size of the first node leaf was reduced and the vein pattern was simplified in a bfa concentration dependent manner . tes were also excessively differentiated in the upper part of the leaf margin but not in the central region treated with bfa . after treatment with bfa _PROTEIN_ veins occasionally developed discontinuously . in the _PROTEIN_ mutant treated with bfa secondary and _PROTEIN_ veins were missing and excess vascular formation seemed to be suppressed . to understand the effect of the _PROTEIN_ mutation on auxin distribution we examined the _PROTEIN_ pattern of the gus construct as a marker of auxin accumulation . in the first node leaves of wild type seedlings gus staining was observed as a dotted pattern in the hydathodes and developing minor veins . each dot represented a cell or a few cells and their shapes varied from round and oval to elongated . in the _PROTEIN_ mutant the gus staining pattern in developing leaves was similar to that of the wild type . however the number of gus _PROTEIN_ spots was significantly reduced _PROTEIN_ . these results suggest a reduction in the number of auxin accumulating cells and/or a reduction in auxin sensitivity . to investigate the role of _PROTEIN_ in the auxin response we examined the _PROTEIN_ pattern of the gus construct in the _PROTEIN_ mutant treated with auxin . in the cotyledons of wild type seedlings _PROTEIN_ of the ectopic gus marker was induced by exogenously applied auxin whereas gus _PROTEIN_ in the _PROTEIN_ mutant was less sensitive to auxin . we also examined the auxin response in the _PROTEIN_ roots and hypocotyls by analyzing auxin induced _PROTEIN_ the gravitropic response callus formation and the inhibition of root elongation as described by geldner et al . _METHOD_ et al . and hobbie et al . respectively . the responses were almost the same as those of wild type plants . these results suggest that the _PROTEIN_ gene may be responsible for the auxin response at least in the cotyledons and rosette leaves . to gain further insight into the molecular nature of the _PROTEIN_ gene we isolated it using a positional cloning method . the _PROTEIN_ locus was mapped to chromosome in the kb region between molecular markers and . we sequenced the genomic dna of the ler strain and the _PROTEIN_ mutant spanning annotated open reading frames identified in this region and found a point mutation only in orf . an kb wild type genomic fragment that includes kb upstream from the putative transcription start site and kb downstream from the putative transcription termination site of this orf complemented the discontinuous vascular phenotype of the _PROTEIN_ mutant . we identified orf _GENE_ as the _PROTEIN_ gene . the _PROTEIN_ gene encodes a protein of amino acids and the trp at codon is changed to a stop codon in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . the smart system predicts the _PROTEIN_ protein to have four domains a bar domain a pleckstrin homology domain an arf gap domain and three ankyrin _PROTEIN_ repeats . these domains are located at residues and respectively . the bar domain is expected to mediate protein protein interactions whereas the ph domain is known to mediate protein lipid interactions . the arf gap domain contains a consensus zinc finger motif and functions in the stimulation of _PROTEIN_ hydrolysis . _PROTEIN_ repeats are involved in protein protein interactions and associate to form a higher order structure . a homology search using the dna data bank of japan revealed significant sequence similarity between the putative _PROTEIN_ protein and the human arf gaps with coiled coil domains _PROTEIN_ repeats and ph domains and . _PROTEIN_ has the same domain structure as and . the arf gap domain is highly conserved between _PROTEIN_ and the acaps suggesting that the _PROTEIN_ protein may function as an arf gap . many genes showing significant sequence similarities to the _PROTEIN_ gene were found in arabidopsis thaliana oryza sativa anopheles gambiae mus musculus fugu rubripes drosophila melanogaster dictyostelium discoideum and caenorhabditis elegans . in the arabidopsis genome three genes _GENE_ _GENE_ and _GENE_ show significant sequence similarities to the _PROTEIN_ gene . the deduced amino acid sequences of these homologs are identical to that of _PROTEIN_ and the domain structures of these proteins are the same as that of _PROTEIN_ . in particular sequences of the bar domains are strongly conserved between _PROTEIN_ and these predicted proteins . next we examined the effects of auxin on _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in the cotyledons . we used rt pcr because _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ homologs have high sequence similarity and probes specific to the and utr regions of these genes did not give clear signals on northern analysis . the intensity of the pcr band corresponding to the _PROTEIN_ gene increased significantly with auxin treatment of wild type cotyledons . in contrast _PROTEIN_ gene _PROTEIN_ level _METHOD_ to be reduced by auxin treatment in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . this indicates that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is upregulated by auxin and its auxin dependent induction may be positively regulated by _PROTEIN_ itself . we examined the arf gap activity of the _PROTEIN_ protein using an in vitro arf gap assay . a glutathione s transferase _PROTEIN_ fusion protein and type v _PROTEIN_ protein that lacked the bar domain were _PROTEIN_ in e. coli and purified . the hydrolysis of _PROTEIN_ on recombinant yeast _PROTEIN_ was measured with or without recombinant _PROTEIN_ protein . _PROTEIN_ protein induced _PROTEIN_ hydrolysis on yeast _PROTEIN_ in a concentration and incubation time dependent manner . these results indicate that _PROTEIN_ protein functions as an arf gap that regulates arf cycling between the active arf _PROTEIN_ form and the inactive arf guanosine diphosphate form in the vesicle transport pathway . the ph domain is found in a wide variety of signaling proteins and binds to phosphoinositides . furthermore human acaps which have significant sequence similarity to _PROTEIN_ are known to bind the lipid phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate . to determine whether the _PROTEIN_ protein binds to a lipid we purified recombinant type v _PROTEIN_ protein using affinity chromatography . the ability of the recombinant _PROTEIN_ protein to bind different phospholipids was examined using fat western blotting developed by stevenson et al . . fig . shows the results of fat western blotting probed with recombinant _PROTEIN_ protein . _PROTEIN_ bound to phosphatidylinositol phosphatidylinositol monophosphate and ptdins but not to phosphatidic acid _PROTEIN_ phosphatidylcholine or phosphatidylethanolamine . _PROTEIN_ bound to with higher affinity than to ptdins or ptdins . recombinant _PROTEIN_ protein did not bind to any of the lipids tested . the bar domain is known to mediate protein protein interactions . to determine whether the _PROTEIN_ protein _METHOD_ a homodimer through the bar domain we performed yeast two hybrid analyses . eight types of _PROTEIN_ cdna fragments were translationally fused to the activation domain and/or dna binding domain . types i vii were composed of the bar domain the ph domain the gap and c terminal domains the bar and ph domains the ph c terminal domain the gap domain and the truncated bar domain respectively . as shown in fig . when the intact bar domain was used in the yeast two hybrid analysis protein protein interactions were detected . this indicates that the bar domain is required and is sufficient for the formation of the _PROTEIN_ homodimer . arf gap is a key component in vesicle formation for _LOCATION_ transport so _PROTEIN_ protein is expected to locate to an organelle involved in the secretory system . furthermore human acaps are located in endosomes . _PROTEIN_ arf gef which is involved in vascular formation is also considered to function in endosomes . however _PROTEIN_ and acaps have different binding affinities for lipids and _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ seem to act differently in vascular pattern formation and have different effects on auxin signaling . therefore we identified the subcellular location of _PROTEIN_ to better understand its function . venus tagged _PROTEIN_ and green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ tagged subcellular marker genes were co introduced into arabidopsis suspension cultured cells and their subcellular locations were observed with a confocal laser scanning microscope . the location of _PROTEIN_ venus did not overlap with that of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ marker hdel _METHOD_ or the _LOCATION_ body marker _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ that marks the cis faces of _LOCATION_ stacks . furthermore it also did not colocalize with the endosome marker _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . nor did it colocalize with the lipophilic endocytic tracer . we also examined the localization of _PROTEIN_ venus in gnom suspension cultured cells because cultured gnom cells contain abnormally enlarged endosomes that mediate the endosome _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ recycling of _PROTEIN_ . the structure of the organelle in which the _PROTEIN_ venus protein was located was completely different from the enlarged organelle that was stained with the endosome marker _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in cultured gnom cells . this indicates that _PROTEIN_ is not located in the endosomes in which _PROTEIN_ functions . however _PROTEIN_ venus positive compartments overlapped with those of the tgn marker _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . these results indicate that the _PROTEIN_ protein is located in the tgn . interestingly not all the tgn was positive for _PROTEIN_ venus . this unique localization pattern suggests that the tgn is not uniform but is functionally differentiated in plant cells .
the landsberg _LOCATION_ strain of arabidopsis thaliana heynh was used as the wild type and the _PROTEIN_ mutant was used in this study unless otherwise indicated . mutants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were used for double mutant analyses . surface sterilized seeds were plated on growth medium containing murashige and skoog basal salts sucrose mes and phytagel . seeds were then transferred to a growth room at under continuous white light . to generate double mutants of _PROTEIN_ with the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ plants heterozygous for _PROTEIN_ were crossed with plants heterozygous for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ . double mutants were identified within families that segregated for each single mutant and were distinguished by the presence of the distinct morphological features characteristic of each parental mutant phenotype . furthermore the genotypes of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mp double mutants were confirmed by cleaved amplified polymorphic sequences . in the double mutant combinations of _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ mutants from each combination segregated at ratios of about _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . naphthalene acetic acid n naphthylphthalamic acid and brefeldin a were used as mm stock solutions in dimethylsulfoxide _METHOD_ . these chemicals were added to the autoclaved medium . for the analysis of gus _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ mutants the _PROTEIN_ mutation was introduced into gus transgenic plants by crossing . for histochemical analysis gus staining was performed as described by koizumi et al . except that samples were incubated in the gus substrate solution for hours . fixed samples were dehydrated through a graded ethanol series and embedded in technovit resin . sections were cut with a microtome and observed under a light microscope equipped with nomarski optics . the density of gus positive spots was measured using first node leaves of day old seedlings . leaves of about the same length were used . spots and leaf area measurements were made after the specimens were photographed . for the analysis of the auxin response cotyledons of day old seedlings and first node leaves of day old plants were excised at the center . they were then incubated in ml of liquid gm containing naa for hours with subsequent histochemical detection . total rna was isolated as described previously and rt pcr analysis to quantify the _PROTEIN_ of auxin inducible genes was performed according to the instructions for the ready to go rt rcr beads using a set of primers specific to the _PROTEIN_ gene _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . to detect the levels of control transcripts we used _PROTEIN_ primers cttccttgactgcttctc and tcatcgtcaccaccttca . the _PROTEIN_ locus was mapped between the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ markers on chromosome . a number of new simple sequence length polymorphism and caps markers between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ markers were developed from data obtained from the tair database and cereon genomics . in the generation produced from crosses between _PROTEIN_ heterozygotes and columbia recombinants between the _PROTEIN_ locus and the new sslp and caps loci were scored . from chromosomes were analyzed and the _PROTEIN_ locus was identified in the kb region between the and markers . this corresponds to two adjoining bacterial artificial chromosome clones including putative genes in the interval between the and markers . these were pcr amplified from the ler strain and _PROTEIN_ and completely sequenced using the bigdye terminator cycle sequencing kit on an abi prism genetic analyzer . among these putative genes only the gene contained a mutation in a putative exon . an kb xbai spei genomic dna fragment that included the kb upstream region of this gene and the kb downstream region was cloned into the vector pgreen . the clone was introduced into agrobacterium tumefaciens strain and transformed into plants carrying the heterozygous _PROTEIN_ mutation _PROTEIN_ using the floral dip method . after hygromycin selection seeds were collected from individual plants and lines were constructed . all line seeds were grown with hygromycin and the segregation of resistance was examined . in the line plants presumed to carry single copies of t dna and a heterozygous _PROTEIN_ mutation segregated at ratios close to _PROTEIN_ . these results led us to conclude that the _PROTEIN_ gene corresponds to . full length _PROTEIN_ cdna was isolated by rt pcr from the a. thaliana columbia ecotype and an xhoi/ncoi restriction site was introduced at both ends . the fragment was translationally fused to the n terminus of venus yellow _METHOD_ protein . the chimeric gene was subcloned under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus promoter and the nos terminator . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ hdel _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were used as intracellular markers of early endosomes _PROTEIN_ endosomes _LOCATION_ cis _LOCATION_ early endosomes and tng respectively . double transient _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ venus and of intracellular markers in the protoplasts of cultured arabidopsis cells were analyzed as described by ueda et al . . protoplasts from gnom mutant cells were prepared as described by geldner et al . . _METHOD_ was observed by confocal laser microscopy _PROTEIN_ . myristoylated yeast _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was purified from escherichia coli co transfected with _PROTEIN_ vectors for _PROTEIN_ and yeast n myristoyltransferase as described previously . arf gap activity was determined by an in vitro assay that measured a single round of _PROTEIN_ hydrolysis in recombinant myr _PROTEIN_ . myr arflp was first loaded with _PROTEIN_ in arf loading buffer _PROTEIN_ . the reaction was stopped with the addition of at a final concentration of mm and a gap assay was performed at in mm hepes mm mm _PROTEIN_ and recombinant _PROTEIN_ . the reaction was initiated with the addition of m _PROTEIN_ loaded _PROTEIN_ and stopped with the addition of mm edta . the medium was then placed on ice . nucleotides were separated by thin layer chromatography on poly cellulose sheets developed with m licl and m hcooh . the sheets were dried autoradiographed on an imaging plate and quantitatively analyzed with a bioimaging analyzer _PROTEIN_ . in the absence of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ showed no _PROTEIN_ hydrolysis activity . phospholipids were prepared in chloroform as stock solutions at concentrations of mg/ml . solutions containing or of lipid were spotted individually onto nitrocellulose . the _LOCATION_ and lipids were dried at room temperature for hour and the nitrocellulose was incubated with fatty acid free bovine serum albumin in tris buffered saline tween solution for hour . the _LOCATION_ was then placed in a solution containing _PROTEIN_ tagged recombinant type v _PROTEIN_ fusion protein diluted in tbst and incubated at overnight with shaking . the nitrocellulose was then washed with tbst three times for minutes each and incubated with anti _PROTEIN_ antibody diluted in tbst for hour at room temperature . the _LOCATION_ was then washed three times for minutes each in tbst at room temperature and incubated for hour at room temperature with goat anti rabbit igg antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase diluted in tbst . the nitrocellulose was washed again three times in tbst for minutes each and incubated for minutes in a mixture of peroxidase substrate and luminol/enhancer for subsequent chemiluminescence detection . the nitrocellulose was exposed to hyperfilm ecl for minute . the anti _PROTEIN_ antibody was raised against a synthetic peptide encoded between the bar and ph domains ekmqeykrqvdresr injected into a rabbit . a two hybrid analysis was performed using the matchmaker two hybrid system was used for ad and was used for dna bd . a standard complete yeast extract peptone dextrose medium was used for cell growth and synthetic dextrose medium was used as the selective medium to which tryptophan leucine adenine and histidine were added as needed to final concentrations of mg/l g/l mg/l and mg/l respectively . protein protein interactions were detected by yeast viability on agar plates without adenine or histidine . full length _PROTEIN_ cdna and seven types of truncated _PROTEIN_ cdnas were amplified using pcr confirmed by sequencing and cloned into and/or as shown in fig . . the orf of the _PROTEIN_ gene has been submitted to genbank under accession number .
