is required for protein processing sorting and secretion in eukaryotic cells although the particular roles of the transporters involved in the secretory system of plants are obscure . one endomembrane type ca _PROTEIN_ from arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ diverges from _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in protein sequence yet _PROTEIN_ appears similar in transport activity to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ bound _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in a yeast mutant defective in its endogenous pumps conferred the ability to grow on depleted medium and tolerance to toxic levels of . a green _METHOD_ protein tagged _PROTEIN_ was functionally competent and localized to intracellular _LOCATION_ of yeast suggesting that and loading into internal compartment enhanced yeast proliferation . in mesophyll protoplasts _PROTEIN_ green _METHOD_ protein associated with a subpopulation of endosome/prevacuolar compartments based on partial colocalization with the _PROTEIN_ marker . interestingly three independent _PROTEIN_ t dna disruption mutants showed severe reduction in root growth normally stimulated by mm indicating that _PROTEIN_ function can not be replaced by an _LOCATION_ associated _PROTEIN_ . furthermore root growth of mutants is sensitive to indicating that _PROTEIN_ is also important for the detoxification of excess . curiously _PROTEIN_ mutant roots produced more apoplastic protein than wild type roots as monitored by peroxidase activity suggesting that the secretory process was altered . together these results demonstrate that the role of _PROTEIN_ is distinct from that of the more abundant _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ supports stimulated root growth and the detoxification of high possibly through activities mediated by post _LOCATION_ compartments that coordinate _LOCATION_ traffic and sorting of materials to the _LOCATION_ and the cell wall .
several ecas from arabidopsis rice and tomato clustered on a phylogenetic tree with mammalian sarcoplasmic/er _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ however only _PROTEIN_ and shared higher identity with mammalian _PROTEIN_ than with other members of the eca subfamily . intriguingly none of the plant ecas grouped with spca or secretory pathway _PROTEIN_ which are represented by yeast and human spca . sequence alignments revealed further insights . _PROTEIN_ shared considerable amino acid sequence identity with transmembrane and of mammalian _PROTEIN_ . the helices of and form the cavity that binds thapsigargin in the conformation state of rabbit skeletal muscle _PROTEIN_ . interestingly among the hydrophobic residues that face thapsigargin val val and phe of rabbit ocserca and human are conserved and identical in the plant _PROTEIN_ from arabidopsis and rice . in contrast these residues are not found in yeast or _PROTEIN_ both of which are insensitive to thapsigargin . in addition an extra tripeptide sequence q/hea corresponding to residues and of was present in most plant ecas but not in _PROTEIN_ . this analysis suggests that _PROTEIN_ is distinct from other arabidopsis ecas and that plant _PROTEIN_ like proteins are structurally the most similar to animal _LOCATION_ . to determine the transport function of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ a cdna containing the complete open reading frame was cloned and _PROTEIN_ in yeast strain . the complete orf of bases encoded a protein of residues . is incapable of loading and into specific endomembrane compartments with high affinity as it lacks a functional _LOCATION_ pump and a _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ respectively . therefore growth of is retarded or arrested when the culture medium contains submicromolar or toxic levels of . however the strain proliferates on medium containing high using a _LOCATION_ /h exchanger that sequesters into endomembrane compartments . the strain _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ grew slower than yeast _PROTEIN_ the empty vector in synthetic complete medium containing no egta . however when free was reduced to approximately by mm egta growth of the strain was severely curtailed . _PROTEIN_ partially restored yeast growth on depleted medium relative to wild type cells . curiously under the same _PROTEIN_ promoter _PROTEIN_ was less effective than _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in restoring mutant growth on depleted medium . _PROTEIN_ rescued growth in medium containing mm egta as shown before while _PROTEIN_ did not . however _PROTEIN_ effectively restored mutant growth on medium containing mm egta indicating that the two ecas although similar in transport activity might differ in their kinetic properties _LOCATION_ localization or _PROTEIN_ level as suggested below . we tested whether _PROTEIN_ might support yeast growth at high . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ under the _PROTEIN_ promoter on vector failed to suppress the sensitivity of strain . consequently _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ using _PROTEIN_ which contains a very strong constitutive promoter of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ h _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . under the _PROTEIN_ promoter _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ improved growth on medium containing mm . this observation suggested that _PROTEIN_ can also function as a pump to remove excess from the _LOCATION_ similar to the _LOCATION_ bound _PROTEIN_ . to localize _PROTEIN_ protein in yeast a construct was made to generate a _METHOD_ fusion to the c terminus of _PROTEIN_ . unlike other atecas _PROTEIN_ lacks a typical _LOCATION_ retention motif kxkxx at its extreme c terminus although it is rich in basic amino acid residues _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was observed in intracellular tubular and granular structures that resembled the distribution of _METHOD_ a yeast pump localized to the _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ . the _METHOD_ tagged protein restored the growth of transformants on medium containing mm egta or mm . these results indicate that the functionally active _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ is localized to endomembranes in yeast . to test the biological function of _PROTEIN_ in planta several t dna insertional lines were identified from the salk collection and from syngenta . homozygous lines of each allele were obtained and their genotypes confirmed by pcr . left border sequencing of the t dna was conducted to verify the insertion site of each allele . mutants _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ hosted t dna insertions in intron and intron respectively while _PROTEIN_ had an insertion in exon . to test for _PROTEIN_ transcript total rna was extracted from week old wild type and mutant plants grown on half strength murashige and skoog _METHOD_ medium and reverse transcribed . primers were designed to amplify any transcript upstream or downstream of the insertion site . primers flanking the t dna insertion site and primer set and failed to amplify any product from all three mutants . nevertheless primers and amplified a product of bp upstream of the insertion site in all three mutant alleles indicating the presence of a truncated mrna . although the length of these transcripts is unclear any potential translated protein would likely include only four tm regions out of eight to tm found in p type _PROTEIN_ . a protein lacking a complete hydrophilic domain and to is unlikely to have any catalytic activity . these t dna insertional lines were used in phenotypic analyses as nonfunctional _PROTEIN_ mutants . siblings without t dna insertions from the same segregating population were used as wild type controls . all three homozygous mutant lines were viable and completed their life cycle under normal conditions . no obvious growth or developmental defects were observed in the vegetative plants grown on soil . our results suggested that calcium pump _PROTEIN_ also catalyzes the transport of into endomembrane compartments as its _PROTEIN_ in the yeast mutant conferred tolerance to toxic levels of . so we examined the effect of levels on root growth . plants were first grown in quarter strength hoagland nutrient medium containing from to . the root length of mutants was similar to that of wild type plants in medium containing at or . but root growth of _PROTEIN_ was clearly reduced compared with that of wild type plants when was elevated to . moreover mutants manifested little or no _PROTEIN_ roots after d of growth suggesting inhibition of _PROTEIN_ root initiation . the compromised root growth also caused changes in shoot growth such as reduced leaf expansion and rosette size . therefore as in yeast _PROTEIN_ conferred tolerance to high in plants . similar results were obtained when plants were nourished by half strength _METHOD_ medium which contains . primary roots of wild type plants grew but _PROTEIN_ mutant growth was inhibited . wild type plants also became sensitive when was increased to . it is noted that a concentration of in half strength _METHOD_ medium is considered unusually high compared with a recommended of less than in hoagland 's nutrient medium . therefore probably imposes a stress that is tolerated by the wild type but not by mutant seedlings . in contrast increasing inhibited the root growth of both wild type and _PROTEIN_ plants similarly . these results indicate that _PROTEIN_ could alleviate toxicity through a mechanism distinct from that which guards against toxicity another essential yet potentially toxic divalent heavy metal . these results are consistent with the notion that _PROTEIN_ transports but is not involved in transporting . at a few millimolar concentration is required for root growth so we tested the effect of on root growth in mutant lines containing a t dna insertion in the _PROTEIN_ gene . the effect of external on root growth in wild type seedlings was first tested using half strength _METHOD_ medium in which the concentration was specifically varied . calcium at mm stimulated root growth as shown before . reduced root length at mm or less confirmed that this level of limited growth . similarly root growth at mm was _PROTEIN_ demonstrating that excess was stressful to the seedling . intriguingly the mm stimulated root growth was not observed in _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ mutants indicating that mutants were nearly insensitive to the beneficial effects of . similar results were observed in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . at mm root lengths of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants were reduced by and respectively compared with wild type controls . with mm external it is reasonable to assume that entry pathways via cation permeable channels are functional in _PROTEIN_ mutants . thus the results indicate that reduced growth is due to defective sorting of _LOCATION_ into one or more intracellular compartments or organelles . the tissue specific pattern of _PROTEIN_ for _PROTEIN_ was examined by gus reporter activity driven by a kb intergenic region upstream of the orf . in vegetative tissues _PROTEIN_ activity was enriched in vascular tissues of primary roots _PROTEIN_ roots and young expanding leaves . at the root tip gus activity first appeared in the elongation and differentiation zones but was not detectable in the cell division zone under the conditions tested . gus activity was not detected in the shoot apex or in fully expanded cotyledons . promoter activity was also detected in vascular tissues of floral pedicels and of the style . _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in other cell types is not excluded by this analysis as the gus gene was transcriptionally fused to the regulatory region only so that any transcriptional regulation by cis acting elements within introns would be missed as would or chromosomal positional effects . rt pcr of total rna verified the presence of _PROTEIN_ transcripts in root and leaf . using a smaller kb promoter fragment upstream of _PROTEIN_ citation showed that _PROTEIN_ in vascular tissues was enriched in xylem parenchyma and the pericyle . in addition gus activity was detected in root caps hydathodes and guard cells . thus although minor differences exist in the two studies the results using either a or kb promoter show similarities that are supported in general by whole genome _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ data . the _PROTEIN_ promoter activity appeared to be lower than that of _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ based on d of bromo chloro indolyl d _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ staining required to visualize gus activity . in contrast _PROTEIN_ activity was detected after h of incubation in x _PROTEIN_ in roots and leaves including the root tip _PROTEIN_ roots vascular tissues ground tissues and guard cells . the higher _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ relative to _PROTEIN_ is supported by the root _PROTEIN_ map from the benfey laboratory . together these results confirm that _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ in all cell types found in roots but that its _PROTEIN_ is consistently much lower than that of _PROTEIN_ . although functional studies from yeast and plants suggest that _PROTEIN_ is localized to endomembrane compartments the identity of the compartment is unclear . we determined the _LOCATION_ location of _PROTEIN_ after transient _PROTEIN_ using the cauliflower mosaic virus promoter in arabidopsis mesophyll protoplasts . we first demonstrated that the _PROTEIN_ fused at the c terminus to _METHOD_ retained native activity judging by its ability to restore yeast mutant growth on depleted medium or medium containing toxic levels of . cells _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ alone had small punctate _METHOD_ that resembled the puncta seen in _LOCATION_ or post _LOCATION_ compartment markers including sialyl transferase _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ . the puncta from _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were dissimilar from those emitted from the _LOCATION_ or a _LOCATION_ marker _PROTEIN_ . a _METHOD_ tag at the c terminus apparently did not interfere with potential retention signals for another calcium pump as _PROTEIN_ tagged with _METHOD_ at the c terminus gave a reticulate _METHOD_ pattern characteristic of _LOCATION_ when it was transiently _PROTEIN_ in protoplasts . _PROTEIN_ was previously localized to the _LOCATION_ by cell fractionation and immunostaining . to clarify the _LOCATION_ location _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was coexpressed with markers tagged with a red _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ in protoplasts . the _METHOD_ signals were carefully collected with a zeiss lsm confocal microscope using different emission wavelengths . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ did not colocalize with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ which are markers for the trans _LOCATION_ or the trans _LOCATION_ network respectively . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ colocalized in part with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ an endosome/pvc marker as indicated by the extent of yellow _METHOD_ in merged images . these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ is localized to a subpopulation of post _LOCATION_ compartments including endosomes and pvcs . because plant post _LOCATION_ compartments are involved in the processing sorting and exocytosis of proteins we wondered whether secretory activities might be compromised in _PROTEIN_ mutants . the activities of secreted apoplastic peroxidases were examined in roots from hydroponically grown plants . apoplastic washing fluid was extracted from roots by first vacuum infiltrating the tissue with buffer and then collecting the fluid by centrifugation . guaiacol dependent peroxidase activity was then monitored spectrophotometrically by following the oxidation of guaiacol by hydrogen peroxide to form tetraguaiacol . we first established that the enzyme reaction monitored by the appearance of tetraguaiacol was linear for min . the initial rate of the reaction was then estimated from the slope . increasing aliquots of awf from wild type roots produced an enhanced rate of guaiacol oxidation indicating that arabidopsis roots contained _LOCATION_ peroxidase activity . based on four independent experiments the _LOCATION_ peroxidase activity of wild type roots was estimated to be nmol fresh weight of root . when awf of mutants was analyzed an increase in apx was consistently observed when activity was _PROTEIN_ per gram fresh weight of roots . the apx activity of _PROTEIN_ mutants was approximately nmol fresh weight of root . in three independent experiments the activity of the mutants was and higher than that of wild type controls . the increase in activity was accompanied by an increased amount of apoplastic protein by the mutants . _PROTEIN_ mutant roots produced and more protein per gram fresh weight of tissue than did wild type roots . similar results were obtained with the _PROTEIN_ mutant which produced fold more apoplastic protein than did wild type roots . thus the specific activity of peroxidase was relatively unchanged in the apoplastic fluid between the wild type and mutants . interestingly the increase in both activity and protein in the mutants was still detected when they were based on milliliters of awf . these results indicate that the concentration of protein and peroxidase was increased in the _LOCATION_ fluid of mutants . the volume of fluid collected per gram fresh weight of tissue was quite similar although slightly more was recovered from the mutant than from the wild type . together these results suggest that the secretory process of the _PROTEIN_ mutant is altered causing an increase in total apoplastic protein and a proportional increase in the activity of secreted peroxidase activity .
wild type and _PROTEIN_ arabidopsis plants were used in this study . homozygous seed stocks for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ correspond to and lines respectively . for growth on plates arabidopsis seeds were surface sterilized by soaking in clorox and tween for min followed by five rinses in sterile water . the seeds were placed on half strength _METHOD_ medium containing agar and mm mes k at ph followed by stratification at for d in the dark . the plates were then positioned vertically in conviron _PROTEIN_ growth chambers with a photoperiod of h of light under an illumination of to and h of dark . the temperature was set at in the day and at night . for soil grown plants arabidopsis seeds were planted on synthetic soil mixture containing miracle gro potting mix and perlite

. plants were watered twice per week or as needed . wild type and mutant plants were always grown side by side in the same tray and growth chamber for consistency . three days after germination on square plates containing standard half strength _METHOD_ medium the seedlings were transferred onto half strength _METHOD_ medium plates containing different concentrations as specified in results. the plates were then positioned in an inverted orientation for another few days before photographs were taken by scanning the plates using a umax astra scanner . root measurement was conducted using scionimage software . the wild type and mutant plants were treated with the same conditions by placing them side by side on the same plate . arabidopsis seeds were dispersed on quarter strength hoagland medium solidified with agar on the bottom of a ml tip box . after germination the tip boxes were floated on quarter strength hoagland medium aerated by a fish tank air pump . medium was replaced twice per week to prevent algal contamination . roots penetrating the medium were excised after to weeks . _PROTEIN_ cdna was amplified by pcr from first strand cdna . the template was reverse transcribed from total rna of week old rosette leaves using primers _PROTEIN_ f and _PROTEIN_ r . proofreading high fidelity taq dna polymerase deep vent was used to amplify the dna . the pcr product was purified by gel extraction and ligated to an ecorv linearized vector pbluescript sk . the cloned sequence was verified by sequencing and used for subsequent cdna subcloning . genomic dna was isolated from week old plants using the cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide method . based on the annotation of bacterial artificial chromosome clone the region between the _PROTEIN_ start codon and its immediate upstream orf _PROTEIN_ was taken as the _PROTEIN_ promoter . this region was amplified using primer sequences with appended restriction enzyme sites _PROTEIN_ pf and _PROTEIN_ pr . the pcr amplified product of kb was digested with xhoi and ncoi and cloned into a gus orf containing vector prita to make a construct _PROTEIN_ rita . the construct was verified by sequencing . the noti noti fragment of eca rita was ligated to the binary vector pmlbart . the resulting gus mlbart construct was introduced into plants by the floral dip method and plants homozygous for a basta resistance marker were analyzed for activity . transgenic plants containing _PROTEIN_ were obtained using a similar method . primers _PROTEIN_ pf and _PROTEIN_ pr were used to amplify a kb fragment upstream of the _PROTEIN_ orf . conventional cloning and gateway cloning methods were used to obtain _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ . for conventional cloning _PROTEIN_ cdna was amplified by pcr using platinum pfx dna polymerase and the primer pair _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . the resultant pcr amplified product for the c tail fused _METHOD_ was digested with bsphi and ligated to the ncoi cut vector . the resultant construct _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was verified by sequencing of the _PROTEIN_ coding region and contains a camv promoter . for gateway cloning the _PROTEIN_ cdna was amplified by pcr using platinum pfx dna polymerase and primers _PROTEIN_ gf and _PROTEIN_ gr . the pcr amplified fragment of _PROTEIN_ was cloned into the gateway vector to produce an entry clone _PROTEIN_ using _PROTEIN_ recombination cloning strategy . the sequence of the _PROTEIN_ insert was verified . the clone _PROTEIN_ was then cloned into the gateway destination binary vector by lr recombination . the resultant construct _PROTEIN_ fwg contains an _PROTEIN_ cassette of camv _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . both conventional clones and gateway clones were used in localization experiments . agrobacterium tumefaciens strain was transformed with the binary vectors via electroporation and transformants were selected on luria bertani plates with gentamicin and spectinomycin . arabidopsis ecotype col plants were transformed with agrobacterium using the floral dip method . plant transformants were selected on plates containing basta or kanamycin . at least five lines were checked for a consistent gus staining pattern . samples at various stages were harvested in acetone rinsed once with staining buffer containing mm na phosphate mm _PROTEIN_ and mm _PROTEIN_ and then incubated for h at in buffer containing mm x _PROTEIN_ . the reaction was stopped in ethanol and chlorophyll was cleared in ethanol . gus activity was visualized with a nikon eclipse microscope equipped with differential interference contrast and images were recorded using a nikon digital camera . the yeast strains used were _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and . yeast was transformed with _PROTEIN_ constructs by the lithium acetate method . _PROTEIN_ cdna was initially subcloned into the yeast _PROTEIN_ vector by ternary ligation of three fragments kb fragment of a kpni/hindiii digested _PROTEIN_ bsk clone kb fragment of a spei/kpni digested _PROTEIN_ bsk and kb fragment of a spei/hindiii digested . this strategy was taken due to limited restriction enzyme sites in the vector and an internal kpni site in _PROTEIN_ . the final vector _PROTEIN_ contains a _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ cassette and was verified by enzyme digestion . for gateway cloning _PROTEIN_ was recombined with three destination vectors pyes and . the first two cassettes drive strong _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ under the _PROTEIN_ promoter _PROTEIN_ and the _PROTEIN_ promoter _PROTEIN_ . in the _PROTEIN_ promoter was replaced by the _PROTEIN_ promoter . the vector uses the _PROTEIN_ promoter to drive the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ fused at its c terminal tail to _METHOD_ . at least three independent transformants from each construct were inoculated in synthetic complete medium with glc but no uracil . an overnight culture was diluted to an of washed twice and suspended in sterile water . a six step serial dilution of fold was prepared in sterile water for each culture . five microliters of each was spotted onto the sc ura plates supplemented with different ions or egta . the ph of the medium was _PROTEIN_ with mm mes koh at ph or . growth at was recorded at varying times . transient _PROTEIN_ was conducted according to published protocols with modifications . arabidopsis leaves from approximately week old plants grown under continuous low light and constant temperature were cut into small strips and digested in ml of enzyme solution for h. the digestion solution consisted of cellulose _PROTEIN_ macerozyme _PROTEIN_ m mannitol mm kcl mm mes at ph mm fetal bovine serum and mm mercaptoethanol . protoplasts were filtered through nylon mesh and centrifuged at for min . the pellets were washed twice in solution containing m mannitol mm mm kcl mm glc and mm mes at ph by centrifugation at for min . protoplasts were resuspended in mmg solution prior to transfection . plasmids were purified by miniprep kit or plasmid midi kit and resuspended in m mannitol . for each transfection of protoplast suspension was added to a mixture of of plasmids of _PROTEIN_ solution and of peg ca solution . after incubation at room temperature for to min the transfection mixture was diluted with of solution and centrifuged at for s. after supernatant removal protoplasts were resuspended in of wi solution and of _METHOD_ solution _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . transfected protoplasts were incubated in the dark at room temperature for to h before microscopy . in general the efficiency of a single transfection of marker proteins is or more however the efficiency is lower in cotransfections due to differences in _METHOD_ signals and the _PROTEIN_ level of each gene . _METHOD_ signals in protoplasts were examined on the zeiss _PROTEIN_ confocal microscope usually to h after transfection . the filter sets used for excitation and emission are as follows _METHOD_ nm to nm _METHOD_ nm to nm chlorophyll nm nm bright field nm . signals were captured in multichannel mode . images were analyzed and processed in the zeiss lsm image browser and adobe photoshop _METHOD_ . to examine yeast cells _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ liquid cultures grown overnight in sc ura glc medium with of to were used . awf was prepared from roots of arabidopsis grown hydroponically in modified quarter strength hoagland medium . the method was modified from that used to extract apoplastic wall fluid from leaves . arabidopsis roots were rinsed in di water and then excised into mm na phosphate buffer . excised roots were submerged in ml of buffer and subjected to vacuum infiltration for min . the roots were then carefully blotted dry on filter paper weighed and put into a ml syringe barrel . the barrel was placed in a ml falcon tube and the whole ensemble was centrifuged at for min . the awf was collected from the bottom of the falcon tube . the relative recovery of apoplastic fluid volume from wild type or mutant tissue was similar when the fresh weight of the tissue was similar . therefore the fresh weight of mutant and wild type tissue for each independent experiment was kept nearly equivalent . the total protein in the extracted awf was estimated using a bio rad protein assay dye reagent . peroxidase activity of the awf fraction was determined from the rate of oxidation of guaiacol to tetraguaiacol . in the presence of peroxidases the artificial substrate guaiacol was oxidized by hydrogen peroxide to tetraguaiacol which was monitored as an increase in . briefly and awf samples containing to of total protein were added to a ml reaction mixture containing hydrogen peroxide and guaiacol in mm sodium phosphate at ph . the reaction was started by adding guaiacol and the increase in was recorded for an initial min using a beckman du spectrophotometer at room temperature . the rate of change was _PROTEIN_ as nanomoles per minute per gram of tissue using a molecular extinction coefficient of . at least three independent experiments were conducted for each set of wild type and mutant plants . sequence data from this article can be found in the genbank/embl data libraries under accession number . the following
