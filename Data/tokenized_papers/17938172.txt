_PROTEIN_ lipid trafficking is essential in eukaryotic cells as _LOCATION_ of lipid assembly are often distinct from final destination _LOCATION_ . a striking example is the biogenesis of the photosynthetic _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ in _LOCATION_ of plants . lipid biosynthetic enzymes at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and the inner and outer _LOCATION_ envelope _LOCATION_ are involved . this compartmentalization requires extensive lipid trafficking . mutants of arabidopsis are available that are disrupted in the incorporation of _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ derived lipid precursors into _LOCATION_ lipids . two proteins affected in two of these mutants trigalactosyldiacylglycerol _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ encode the permease and substrate binding component respectively of a proposed lipid translocator at the inner chloroplast envelope _LOCATION_ . here we describe a third protein of arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ a small _PROTEIN_ proposed to be part of this translocator . as in the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants triacylglycerols and trigalactolipids accumulate in a _PROTEIN_ mutant carrying a t dna insertion just of the _PROTEIN_ coding region . the _PROTEIN_ protein shows basal _PROTEIN_ activity and is localized inside the chloroplast beyond the inner chloroplast envelope _LOCATION_ . proteins orthologous to _PROTEIN_ and are predicted to be present in gram bacteria and the respective genes are organized in operons suggesting a common biochemical role for the gene products . based on the current analysis it is hypothesized that _PROTEIN_ is the missing _PROTEIN_ component of a lipid transporter involving _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ required for the biosynthesis of _LOCATION_ derived _LOCATION_ lipids in arabidopsis .
identification of _PROTEIN_ by genomics and reverse genes involved in the same biochemical process are commonly linked in operons . this _PROTEIN_ has been successfully exploited in genome annotation or the identification of individual genes . accordingly the location of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ encoding homologs in bacterial operons adjacent to putative abc proteins suggests that these are the abc components of the respective transport complex . based on comparative genomics it seemed likely that arabidopsis has an abc protein associated with the _PROTEIN_ transporter . an extensive and possibly complete inventory of transport _PROTEIN_ and non intrinsic abc proteins potentially associated with _LOCATION_ transporters in arabidopsis has been published listing soluble nucleotide binding domain proteins . because _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are associated with the inner chloroplast _LOCATION_ which is homologous to the bacterial cell _LOCATION_ we expected that the respective abc protein was localized on the inside of the inner chloroplast _LOCATION_ requiring an n terminal chloroplast targeting sequence . nine of the above mentioned abc proteins were predicted to be targeted to the _LOCATION_ using chlorop _GENE_ _GENE_ _GENE_ _GENE_ _GENE_ _GENE_ _GENE_ _GENE_ _GENE_ . for seven of these candidate genes t dna inactivation lines were available at the time and were selfed and selected for homozygosity . the homozygous mutant lines were tested for the presence of trigalactosyldiacylglycerol which is diagnostic for mutants with impaired _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ function . only one inactivation line carrying a t dna of the presumed _PROTEIN_ start codon of arabidopsis gene _GENE_ showed accumulation of the oligogalactolipid . this mutant was clearly leaky as the abundance of the respective mrna estimated by semiquantitative reverse transcriptase pcr was only partially reduced in the t dna line . a completely disrupted allele was not available . to confirm that the mutant phenotype was not due to secondary mutations a wild type cdna was _PROTEIN_ in the homozygous t dna line disrupted in _GENE_ . two transgenic homozygous t dna lines lacking the accumulation of the oligogalactolipid are shown in fig . c and d. the restoration of the wild type phenotype in the homozygous t dna lines by the corresponding wild type cdna confirmed that the accumulation of oligogalactolipids in the t dna lines was due to the disruption of the _GENE_ locus . from here on the line will be referred to as _PROTEIN_ mutant line _PROTEIN_ . the _GENE_ encoded protein was previously designated non intrinsic abc protein _PROTEIN_ and will be referred to here as trigalactosyldiacylglycerol _PROTEIN_ fitting more closely with its function . comparing the amino acid sequence of _PROTEIN_ with proteins encoded by bacterial genomes using blast abc protein encoding open reading frames adjacent to putative _PROTEIN_ homologs provided some of the best hits with putative _PROTEIN_ homologs from cyanobacteria e.g . synechococcus showing identity and the e. coli homolog identity . the _PROTEIN_ mutant shares a complex lipid phenotype with other tgd is important to note that all three tgd mutant alleles _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ analyzed thus far and discussed here are leaky leading to attenuated phenotypes . more severe impairment of the system as previously shown for _PROTEIN_ causes embryo lethality making fully gene disrupted mutants currently inaccessible to analysis . if the _PROTEIN_ protein indeed is part of a lipid transport complex along with _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutant lipid phenotypes for all three loci should be similar . therefore leaf lipid extracts from the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and the _PROTEIN_ lines were compared by thin layer chromatography of neutral and _PROTEIN_ lipids . the _PROTEIN_ mutant extracts contained a lipid co migrating with triacylglycerol previously identified in the _PROTEIN_ mutant and shown also to accumulate in _PROTEIN_ mutant extracts . in addition _PROTEIN_ lipid extracts of the _PROTEIN_ mutant contained a new lipid staining with naphthol which is diagnostic for the presence of hexoses . this lipid co chromatographed with authentic trigalactosyldiacylglycerol accumulating in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . further confirmation of the identities of tgdg and triacylglycerol lipids was provided by liquid _METHOD_ analyses of leaf extracts of col wild type and _PROTEIN_ mutants . extracted ion _METHOD_ generated in negative ion mode yielded a strong peak at m/z for the _PROTEIN_ mutant corresponding to for tgdg which was the dominant tgdg lipid detected but minimal amounts in the wild type extracts . the in source collision induced dissociation spectra supported this assignment in the form of a fragment ion at m/z corresponding to the fatty acid anion . triacylglycerols were characterized using positive ion electrospray ionization displaying peaks at m/z to corresponding to of triacylglycerols with _PROTEIN_ and a total number of double bonds ranging from to . extracted ion _METHOD_ for signals in the range of m/z showed about fold greater signal in the _PROTEIN_ mutant than the wild type . ion abundances for both tgdg and triacylglycerol lipid peaks were consistent with quantitative analysis of fatty acid methyl esters by gas chromatography coupled to flame ionization detection . the overall lipid composition of the _PROTEIN_ mutant differed from that of the wild type as shown in fig . . most notably the relative amounts of the major chloroplast lipids mgdg and dgdg were _PROTEIN_ whereas the presumed precursor of galactolipids derived from the _LOCATION_ pathway phosphatidylcholine was more abundant . analysis of the fatty acid composition of mgdg and dgdg revealed distinct changes in the fatty acid profiles in _PROTEIN_ as compared with the wild type . most notably fatty acids were generally more saturated and fatty acid content was reduced . moreover the _PROTEIN_ fatty acid profile changes were very similar to those observed for the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants . in general the tgd mutants impaired in the _LOCATION_ pathway have an increased _PROTEIN_ to _PROTEIN_ fatty acid ratio in their galactolipids . this is particularly visible for dgdg which is to a large extent derived from the _LOCATION_ pathway . accordingly the _PROTEIN_ to _PROTEIN_ ratio for the digalactolipid increased from to in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . this phenomenon is due to the substrate specificities of the different acyltransferases in the _LOCATION_ and the _LOCATION_ leading to _PROTEIN_ fatty acids at the sn position and _PROTEIN_ fatty acids at the sn position of the diacylglycerol backbone for _LOCATION_ derived lipids . those lipids derived from the _LOCATION_ pathway carry _PROTEIN_ fatty acids in both positions . positional analysis using rhizopus lipase confirmed an increase in _PROTEIN_ fatty acids in the sn position of mgdg and dgdg of the _PROTEIN_ mutant . overall _PROTEIN_ has a complex lipid phenotype very similar to _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ that is consistent with an impairment of the _LOCATION_ pathway of galactolipid biosynthesis . this similarity in phenotypes also suggests that the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ proteins are involved in the same biochemical process . the _PROTEIN_ protein is imported into the _PROTEIN_ sequence has a predicted chloroplast transit peptide . to verify the localization of the protein the cdna was c terminally fused with a green _METHOD_ protein and transiently _PROTEIN_ in tobacco . the result shown in fig . a c shows the green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ associated with chloroplasts which are identified by their chlorophyll _METHOD_ . to further narrow the location of _PROTEIN_ in vitro translated labeled _PROTEIN_ protein was incubated with isolated pea chloroplasts . two proteases were used to determine the sub chloroplast localization thermolysin a large protease that can only digest _LOCATION_ exposed domains of outer envelope _LOCATION_ proteins unless detergent such as triton x is added and trypsin which can penetrate the outer envelope _LOCATION_ but not the inner . the result of this analysis is shown in fig . . the _PROTEIN_ preprotein was shortened upon import consistent with the removal of a transit peptide . moreover the mature _PROTEIN_ protein was resistant to thermolysin and trypsin treatment but was digested by thermolysin in the presence of detergent . these results were consistent with import of _PROTEIN_ into the chloroplast beyond the inner chloroplast envelope _LOCATION_ . based on these results _PROTEIN_ would be available for association with the _PROTEIN_ complex at the stroma side of the inner envelope _LOCATION_ . recombinant _PROTEIN_ protein has _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ protein contains motifs characteristic for other small _PROTEIN_ associated with bacterial _LOCATION_ transporters designated walker a walker b a loop and q loop . to test the biochemical function of _PROTEIN_ an n terminal truncated cdna missing the coding region for the first amino acids representing the predicted transit peptide was fused to the c terminus encoding end of the e. coli maltose binding protein open reading frame and _PROTEIN_ in e. coli.of several _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ tested this was the only providing soluble _PROTEIN_ protein . purification of the recombinant protein designated mbp on an amylose column is shown in fig . . the fusion protein was highly purified and migrated as a kda protein . the fusion protein in the fraction was assayed for its ability to hydrolyze _PROTEIN_ . for control purposes maltose binding protein by itself or a mutant cdna giving rise to an point mutant of _PROTEIN_ fused in the same manner as the truncated wild type cdna were included . it should be noted that the mutation did not affect protein _PROTEIN_ or protein purification . replacing the a loop residue homologous to in _PROTEIN_ in bacterial orthologs with a nucleophilic cysteine residue was previously shown to greatly _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ dependent transport activities . under standard assay conditions as defined under experimental procedures the reaction was linear for more than min . furthermore the reaction velocity increased linearly with mbp protein concentration in the range tested . varying the concentration of _PROTEIN_ a classic michaelis menten hyperbolic substrate velocity function was observed for the mbp protein . estimated kinetic constants based on this experiment were for the km and min for vmax . these values are in the same range as previously reported for _PROTEIN_ hydrolysis by other abc transporters . the mbp mutant protein had less than residual activity insufficient for accurate determination of the kinetic constants . the maltose binding protein had no activity .
