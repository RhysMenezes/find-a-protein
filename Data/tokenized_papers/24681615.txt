pectins are acidic _PROTEIN_ that comprise a significant fraction of the primary walls of eudicotyledonous plant cells . they influence wall porosity and extensibility thus controlling cell and organ growth during plant development . the regulated degradation of pectins is required for many cell separation events in plants but the role of pectin degradation in cell expansion is poorly defined . using an activation tag screen designed to isolate genes involved in wall expansion we identified a gene encoding a putative polygalacturonase that when overexpressed resulted in enhanced hypocotyl elongation in etiolated arabidopsis thaliana seedlings . we named this gene _PROTEIN_ involved in . plants lacking display reduced hypocotyl elongation that is complemented by transgenic _PROTEIN_ . is _PROTEIN_ in expanding tissues throughout development including seedlings roots leaves and flowers . _METHOD_ _METHOD_ localizes to the apoplast and heterologously _PROTEIN_ displays in vitro polygalacturonase activity supporting a function for this protein in apoplastic pectin degradation . plants either overexpressing or lacking display alterations in total polygalacturonase activity pectin molecular _METHOD_ and wall composition and also display higher proportions of flowers with extra _PROTEIN_ suggesting s involvement in floral organ patterning . these results reveal new roles for polygalacturonases in plant development .
to identify novel genes involved in cell wall expansion we performed activation tag screening using a collection of arabidopsis columbia ecotype lines containing randomly inserted tetrameric enhancer elements . seedlings from pools of lines were grown in the dark on murashige and skoog _METHOD_ media for d to allow for the growth of a lawn of etiolated seedlings . tall seedlings were identified visually transferred to vertical _METHOD_ plates containing suc grown in h light for to d to allow for photomorphogenesis and transferred to soil for maturation and seed harvesting . these taller seedlings represented the initial hits from the screen and hits were isolated from million seedlings . the initial hits were secondarily screened for heritability of the long hypocotyl phenotype and mendelian segregation of a marker encoded by the activation tag t dna . lines that displayed heritable long hypocotyl phenotypes and were likely to contain single insertions were identified and the genomic insertion point for each line was identified using _PROTEIN_ ligation pcr followed by sequencing and alignment to the arabidopsis genome sequence . from the first initial hits we identified independent candidate lines two of which appeared twice in the total group of candidate lines . the double identification of two lines validated our screening approach since each activation tag line was represented by multiple seeds in the pooled collection . within the set of independent candidate lines two insertion points were upstream of genes encoding putative pgs and we chose one of these candidates in which the activation tag insertion point was bp upstream of the predicted start codon of _GENE_ for further analysis . within the pg gene family of arabidopsis _GENE_ is not closely related to previously characterized pgs . we named this gene _PROTEIN_ involved in and performed detailed characterization of its _PROTEIN_ localization biochemical activity and effects on cell walls and plant growth and development as described below . we first confirmed the enhanced hypocotyl elongation phenotype of the activation tag line finding that on average seedling hypocotyls were cm long after d of dark growth whereas col controls were cm long on average . to determine whether this difference in hypocotyl length was due to increased cell length we measured cell lengths in the top middle and bottom regions of hypocotyls of col and seedlings and found that cells in all three regions were significantly longer than control cells the total number of cells along the lengths of hypocotyls did not differ significantly from col controls . to test whether was overexpressed in the line mrna levels were quantified in d old etiolated seedlings using quantitative real time rt pcr and were found to be more than times those of col controls . mrna levels were also higher in _METHOD_ leaves flowers and siliques of plants compared with wild type plants . together these results indicate that enhanced _PROTEIN_ results in longer cells and thus longer hypocotyls in etiolated seedlings of the activation tag line identified in our screen . the activation tag upstream of in the line is expected to amplify its endogenous _PROTEIN_ pattern rather than drive constitutive _PROTEIN_ across all tissues . in addition activation tag enhancer elements can potentially enhance the _PROTEIN_ of multiple genes in their vicinity . to test whether the enhanced hypocotyl elongation observed in the line was attributable to the specific overexpression of we generated transgenic lines in which the coding sequence is _PROTEIN_ under the control of the constitutive strong cauliflower mosaic virus promoter and tested them for etiolated hypocotyl and cell lengths as well as _PROTEIN_ levels . for several independent transformants both the overall hypocotyl lengths and top middle and bottom hypocotyl cell lengths of d old etiolated seedlings were significantly longer than those of controls whereas the numbers of cells along the lengths of hypocotyls from the overexpression lines did not differ significantly from controls . mrna levels were significantly higher in the transformed lines than in wild type controls as measured by qpcr . these results further confirmed that high _PROTEIN_ results in enhanced hypocotyl cell elongation . given that is one of annotated arabidopsis pg encoding genes and that multiple pgs are _PROTEIN_ in most arabidopsis tissues we hypothesized that disrupting function would not result in visible growth phenotypes due to redundancy . thus we were surprised that upon isolating two homozygous t dna insertional mutants containing disruptions in the sixth intron and seventh exon of the gene and confirming that these lines _PROTEIN_ lower mrna levels than wild type controls d old etiolated seedlings of both mutant lines displayed reduced hypocotyl lengths and cell lengths compared with controls . however cell number along the lengths of hypocotyls was not significantly lower in the mutants . these data indicate that functions nonredundantly to promote cell expansion in etiolated hypocotyls and that final cell size in this tissue is likely determined at least in part by the activity of this protein . in pooled data for col mutant and overexpression plants we observed positive correlations between overall hypocotyl length and individual cell length in the top middle and bottom regions of hypocotyls suggesting that cell lengths in all three regions contribute to overall hypocotyl length . we also observed d old wild type and overexpression plants and found that rosette diameter was not significantly smaller than wild type controls in or plants but was significantly larger than wild type controls in and plants . adult plant stem height was slightly reduced in d old and plants but was not significantly different from col controls in mutant or overexpression lines . these data suggest that additional pgs might function redundantly with at _PROTEIN_ developmental stages but that overexpression of is sufficient to enhance the expansion of rosette leaves . to further confirm the function of in cell expansion in etiolated seedlings we generated an _PROTEIN_ construct containing a c terminally tagged _METHOD_ fusion driven by a promoter fragment that corresponded to the kb upstream of the start codon and transformed this construct into the and lines . multiple transformant lines for each background were isolated and assayed for _PROTEIN_ and complementation of the short hypocotyl phenotype we observed in and mutants . as shown in figure _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ lines _PROTEIN_ transcript levels that were often comparable to wild type levels . these lines also displayed hypocotyl lengths that were longer than the and lines and were not significantly different from or in two lines significantly longer than col controls indicating that the transgene rescued the growth defects observed in the mutant alleles . these data further support a function for in hypocotyl cell expansion . based on existing microarray data is putatively _PROTEIN_ in multiple tissues and is most highly _PROTEIN_ in root tissues . we performed qpcr measurements of mrna levels to detect its relative _PROTEIN_ levels in etiolated seedlings roots _METHOD_ leaves and flowers and found higher _PROTEIN_ in roots leaves and flowers with the highest _PROTEIN_ level in flowers . to further analyze the _PROTEIN_ pattern of we generated a promoter gus _PROTEIN_ fusion construct transformed it into col plants and performed gus staining for multiple transformant lines . in young light grown seedlings strong gus _PROTEIN_ was evident in cotyledons basal hypocotyls and roots whereas in etiolated seedlings gus _PROTEIN_ was detectable in the hypocotyl and cotyledons . gus _PROTEIN_ was also detected in flowers expanding rosette leaves and the bases of developing siliques . taken together these data indicate that is highly _PROTEIN_ in some but not all actively growing tissues _METHOD_ as well as tissues where cell separation occurs . is predicted to be amino acids long and to contain a signal peptide that ends with a cleavage site as predicted by signalp . it also contains a domain from amino acids to and is predicted to localize to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ or cell wall/apoplast . to determine its subcellular localization experimentally we cloned downstream of the endogenous promoter and upstream of a _METHOD_ tag generated transformants _PROTEIN_ this construct and observed _METHOD_ seedlings using spinning disk confocal microscopy . we found that _METHOD_ localized _PROTEIN_ at the edges of root epidermal cells . to test whether this localization pattern represents apoplastic or _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ localization seedlings were incubated with m mannitol to induce plasmolysis and examined . the majority of the _METHOD_ signal remained at the cell edges rather than within the protoplast indicating that the fusion protein localizes to the cell wall . to confirm this localization pattern we colabeled _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ cells with the _LOCATION_ dye and found that both markers localized similarly to cell edges in control cells but that this colocalization was disrupted after mannitol induced plasmolysis . to date few arabidopsis putative pgs have been experimentally confirmed to display bona fide pg activity . to determine whether encodes an active pg its full coding sequence was synthesized in a codon optimized form cloned into a bacterial _PROTEIN_ vector as a tagged fusion with sumo to enhance protein solubility transformed into escherichia coli strain and purified using nickel _PROTEIN_ agarose . immunoblotting against purified supernatant from e. coli _PROTEIN_ the full length fusion protein detected the presence of a major band corresponding to the predicted kd size of the his sumo fusion . supernatant containing the partially purified protein was tested for in vitro pg activity using a polygalacturonic acid substrate and was found to contain units of pg activity whereas supernatants from bacteria transformed with the empty vector did not display significant pg activity . these results indicate that heterologously _PROTEIN_ his sumo can cleave polygalacturonans in vitro . given that cleaves polygalacturonic acid in vitro we next wanted to test whether changes in its _PROTEIN_ affected total pg activity in planta . total proteins were extracted from leaves of d old col and plants and assayed for pg activity . we found that total protein from and plants possessed higher pg activity than col controls whereas total protein from plants possessed lower pg activity . these results suggest that contributes significantly to total pg activity in leaves . we next examined the molecular _METHOD_ distribution of pectins isolated from d old etiolated seedling walls by cyclohexylenedinitrilo tetraacetic acid extraction using size exclusion chromatography and found that pectins extracted from and walls had smaller average molecular _METHOD_ than those extracted from col walls whereas pectins extracted from and cell walls had larger average molecular _METHOD_ . together these data indicate that increased _PROTEIN_ results in higher total pg activity to generate smaller hg molecules whereas reduced _PROTEIN_ results in less pg activity and therefore larger hg molecules . to examine the molecular phenotypes of cell walls in overexpression and mutant plants we performed monosaccharide composition analysis of cell walls derived from d old etiolated seedlings and destarched leaves of all six genotypes focusing on changes that were consistent between at least two overexpression and/or both mutant lines . in etiolated seedlings the relative amount of fuc was higher in and walls whereas the relative amount of galacturonic acid was lower in and walls and the relative amount of _PROTEIN_ acid was lower in and walls . in leaves fuc and gal were lower in and walls rhamnose ara and xyl were lower in and walls glc was higher in and walls and galacturonic acid was lower in and walls . we also performed glycome profiling for walls derived from d old etiolated col and seedlings that were sequentially extracted with cdta which extracts _PROTEIN_ pectins and m koh which extracts additional pectins and hemicelluloses . glycome profiling revealed increased cdta extractable hg reduced cdta extractable arabinogalactan proteins _PROTEIN_ reduced koh extractable hg and increased koh extractable rhamnogalacturonan i and _PROTEIN_ in walls compared with controls whereas walls contained increased cdta extractable xyloglucan cdta extractable hg and koh extractable rg i/ag . these results indicate that the molecular composition and/or structure of the cell wall are altered when _PROTEIN_ is either enhanced or reduced . when growing overexpression or mutant plants we noticed that their flowers sometimes possessed five or six _PROTEIN_ rather than the four _PROTEIN_ usually seen in col flowers . the extra _PROTEIN_ did not appear to arise from splitting of these organs after initiation since each _PROTEIN_ contained an independent base in the abnormal flowers . we quantified _PROTEIN_ number for flowers in col controls and mutant plants grown in the same growth containers and found that for both the overexpression and t dna lines the proportion of flowers with extra _PROTEIN_ was significantly higher than in col plants . for flowers with more than four _PROTEIN_ we often observed additional sepals but fewer stamens . to investigate floral development more closely we imaged floral _METHOD_ of all genotypes using scanning electron microscopy and observed more variable angles between flower primordia which normally arise at a consistent angle of degrees relative to the previous primordium in and floral _METHOD_ with and _METHOD_ producing organs at significantly smaller relative angles than col _METHOD_ . these data indicate that changes in _PROTEIN_ perturb normal floral organ patterning .
