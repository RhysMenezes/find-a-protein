plants require daily coordinated regulation of energy metabolism for optimal growth and survival and therefore need to integrate cellular responses with both mitochondrial and _LOCATION_ retrograde signaling . using a forward genetic screen to characterize regulators of alternative mutants we identified nac domain containing _PROTEIN_ as a direct positive regulator of _PROTEIN_ . is targeted to connections and junctions in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and f actin via a c terminal transmembrane domain . a consensus rhomboid protease cleavage site is present in _PROTEIN_ just prior to the predicted tm domain . furthermore addition of the rhomboid protease inhibitor n p tosyl l phe chloromethyl abolishes the induction of _PROTEIN_ upon antimycin a treatment . simultaneous _METHOD_ tagging of _PROTEIN_ with n terminal red _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ and c terminal green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ revealed that the n terminal _METHOD_ domain migrated into the _LOCATION_ while the c terminal _METHOD_ tag remained in the _LOCATION_ . genome wide analysis of the transcriptional network regulated by under stress treatment revealed that function was necessary for > of the changes observed as a primary response to _LOCATION_ hydrogen peroxide but only of transcriptional changes observed in response to antimycin a treatment . plants with mutated were more stress sensitive whereas a gain of function mutation resulted in plants that had lower cellular levels of under untreated conditions .
to identify the molecular components necessary for mitochondrial retrograde signaling under stress in plant cells a forward genetic screen was conducted using _PROTEIN_ as a model which is a stress responsive _LOCATION_ encoded mitochondrial component to identify rao mutants . a construct with the _PROTEIN_ kb upstream promoter region driving a firefly luciferase gene _PROTEIN_ was used as a reporter gene system and permanently transformed into arabidopsis thaliana columbia to generate col luc germ lines . two week old col luc seedlings when treated with antimycin a showed high _PROTEIN_ of luc driven by the _PROTEIN_ promoter . col luc plants were subjected to ethyl methanesulfonate _METHOD_ mutagenesis and two independent lines and were identified as loss of function alleles that showed little or no induction of _PROTEIN_ luc under aa treatment . consistent with the results from aa treatment _PROTEIN_ luc was _PROTEIN_ in myxothiazol treated col luc seedlings but not in the lines . for both aa and myxothiazol treatments luc was fivefold less abundant in the background compared with col luc seedlings . a number of other treatments including monofluoroacetate and to a lesser extent revealed a significant reduction in the induction of luc in the background . by contrast exposure to more general cellular stresses such as uv light cold abscisic acid and salicylic acid did not result in compromised induction of luc suggesting that is likely to mediate a mitochondrial dependent signaling pathway . a combination of classical positional cloning techniques with next generation sequencing technology was used to identify the mutations in mutants . both and are recessive mutations and mapped to the same mb region on chromosome between in/del cereon genomics markers _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and were therefore crossed to test whether these were allelic mutations within the same gene product . plants from the first filial generation were unable to induce _PROTEIN_ luc _PROTEIN_ in response to aa treatment confirming that and were in _PROTEIN_ allelic mutations . to identify candidate point mutations within this mb region in the mutant lines whole genome next generation resequencing was used . a candidate gene at the locus _GENE_ encoding a nac domain transcription _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was identified with nonsynonymous mutations in each of the mutant alleles . wild type coding sequence for _GENE_ _PROTEIN_ under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus promoter was transformed into mutants and restored the ability of transgenic plants to induce _PROTEIN_ luc under aa treatment thus confirming that the phenotype was the result of a specific mutation in _PROTEIN_ . furthermore point mutations in both and were confirmed by sanger sequencing . a single nucleotide change in introduced a stop codon replacing trp at amino acid position whereas the change in produced an amino acid substitution from a pro into a leu at amino acid . the protein is predicted to be a type ii _LOCATION_ protein with a single tm motif at the c terminal end and an n terminus containing the nac domain . belongs to _PROTEIN_ subfamily according to the classification of citation . the point mutations in and are in highly conserved protein regions between members of the _PROTEIN_ subfamily . the allele harbors a mutation in the nac domain while the mutation lies near the boundary of the nac domain . to further confirm that any deficiency in mitochondrial retrograde signaling in the mutant lines was a result of specific inactivation of _PROTEIN_ two t dna lines in the col background were also used in subsequent analyses . the two lines were screened and found to have t dna insertions in the second and fourth exons of the _PROTEIN_ coding sequence respectively . one salk line _PROTEIN_ contained the insertion in the same exon as the _METHOD_ mutants and was shown to be a true knockout line as the full length transcript could not be amplified in this background _PROTEIN_ and the nac domain was disrupted . interestingly the t dna insertion in the second line _PROTEIN_ was in exon just upstream of the predicted tm region but did not disrupt the n terminal nac domain at all . while no transcript could be detected using the and _PROTEIN_ primers a truncated transcript could be detected with primers and with a mobility on an agarose gel indicating a size of bp close in size to the predicted size of bp compared with the size of a genomic dna product that has a predicted size of bp . based on this a new set of primers for quantitative rt pcr analysis of the _PROTEIN_ transcript abundance in _PROTEIN_ revealed that transcript abundance was similar to that in the wild type line . sequencing revealed that the t dna was inserted after codon adding amino acids from the t dna sequence followed by a stop codon . thus the predicted tm region from amino acids to would not be translated in this line . _PROTEIN_ transcript and protein abundance were examined by qrt pcr and immunoblot analyses in col luc and independent mutant lines representing an _METHOD_ mutant the salk t dna insertion line _PROTEIN_ and the salk t dna insertion line and _PROTEIN_ over a period of h of treatment with aa . after h of treatment > fold significant induction of _PROTEIN_ transcript level was observed in col luc as a primary response and after h of treatment this response had already _PROTEIN_ . the magnitude of induction was significantly lower in and _PROTEIN_ with only to fold _PROTEIN_ induction . this result was consistent with a higher level of the luc transcript abundance in col luc under aa treatment compared with that of at h after aa treatment . in the case of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ transcript abundance was significantly higher than col luc under untreated conditions at all time points examined . thus it appears that the _PROTEIN_ allele may produce a constitutively functional protein that is able to induce _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ even without aa treatment and is likely to be a gain of function mutant . however induction of _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ under stress conditions like both and mutants was significantly lower compared with col luc . to confirm that the aberrations in transcriptional regulation of _PROTEIN_ were carried through at a protein level immunoblot analysis was performed . consistent with the transcript analysis _PROTEIN_ protein abundance was fourfold higher in col luc after aa treatment compared with and _PROTEIN_ . next we examined the role of in response to general cellular stresses . excessive ros is toxic to cells and it has been shown that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ increases under conditions of oxidative stress . seedlings were treated with mm for h. three hours after treatment a primary stress response was observed with a greater than sixfold _PROTEIN_ induction in col luc plants . induction of _PROTEIN_ in response to was significantly reduced in and _PROTEIN_ at both a transcript level and a protein level . in the case of _PROTEIN_ as observed previously the constitutive level of _PROTEIN_ was higher than in col luc . two points to note are as follows induction with aa produced a greater induction in _PROTEIN_ than treatment with in _PROTEIN_ the response to aa in the rao mutant and t dna lines was still greater than the response in the wild type control col luc to . at h the response was _PROTEIN_ and was returning to untreated levels in col luc and in mutants with treatment . this is consistent with the luc imaging results for the rao mutants where imaging takes place h after application of aa or . in the case of aa a large reduction in luminescence was still evident but for the difference after h while significant was smaller in magnitude . validation of the binding ability of _PROTEIN_ to the _PROTEIN_ promoter to influence stress responsive induction was performed to confirm direct regulation of _PROTEIN_ by _PROTEIN_ . analysis of the _PROTEIN_ promoter sequence revealed three consensus nac protein binding site sequences cgtgt identified in two independent studies . nac binding sites and are at positions and bp upstream from the transcriptional start site respectively . transient biolistic transformation assays using _PROTEIN_ activity driven by the _PROTEIN_ promoter in arabidopsis suspension cells revealed that the _PROTEIN_ promoter activity increases significantly in response to aa treatment . mutation of any single nac binding site within the promoter led to limited or no significant changes in basal or induced promoter activity . however when a combination of elements was deleted basal promoter activity and stress induction were severely compromised . analysis of the _PROTEIN_ promoter in the _PROTEIN_ t dna mutant showed that treatment with aa did not induce the promoter as it did in col . also failed to induce the gus activity which was consistent with the induction of the _PROTEIN_ transcript abundance in this mutant background as shown in figure in that the induction of _PROTEIN_ with aa was much reduced compared with col luc . the level of _PROTEIN_ transcript in the background was similar to that of col luc . the activity of the proposed nac binding sites was also tested in stably transformed lines . treatment of plants transformed with the wild type _PROTEIN_ promoter with aa resulted in a clear induction of gus activity . deletion of nac binding site resulted in a complete loss of induction of gus activity . deletion of nac binding site resulted in very little loss of staining and deletion of nac binding site resulted in a loss of staining in the blade of the leaves but not in the veins . further evidence of positive binding of to the _PROTEIN_ promoter was detected by yeast one hybrid analyses with and _PROTEIN_ promoter fragments containing nac binding sites and . binding was greatly reduced as evidenced by little or no yeast colony growth when nac binding sites and were mutated indicating that the binding of to binding site and was specific consistent with the gus staining results . finally the binding of to the _PROTEIN_ promoter was also validated by electrophoresis mobility shift assays _METHOD_ . whereas nac binding sites and did not show a specific interaction with _PROTEIN_ protein a clear band shift of radiolabeled probes containing the nac binding site was detected when protein was added due to binding to the protein . unlabeled nac binding site probes could effectively compete out binding and mutation of the nac binding site resulted in a loss of that binding . the subcellular localization of was examined using green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ targeting assays . full length fused to _METHOD_ was seen dispersed in the cytoplasm and formed a web like structure that did not colocalize with mitochondria unlike other transcription _PROTEIN_ involved in _LOCATION_ retrograde signaling that have been recently characterized to be bound within the organelle envelope . when the predicted tm region was deleted from the _METHOD_ fusion _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was detected only in the _LOCATION_ . a _METHOD_ fusion containing only the predicted tm region of displayed a similar pattern as the full length construct . thus it was concluded that the predicted tm region was responsible for the localization of outside the _LOCATION_ . furthermore the full length _METHOD_ showed overlapping _METHOD_ signal with f actin with two independent markers for actin . first with a rhodamine labeled phalloidin control and second in cotransformations with an atfimbrin _METHOD_ _METHOD_ control . together these analyses confirm that is colocalized with f actin filaments within the cell . the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ is intimately connected with f actin and _METHOD_ a cellular transportation network . colocalization with _LOCATION_ was also tested and revealed consistent overlapping _METHOD_ signal between the full length _METHOD_ and _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ . thus we concluded that is targeted to connections and junctions in the _LOCATION_ and f actin via a c terminal tm domain and upon release of this domain is exclusively located in the _LOCATION_ . to characterize the mechanism by which an _LOCATION_ located transcription _PROTEIN_ can activate transcription in the _LOCATION_ the two known _METHOD_ described for activation of _LOCATION_ bound transcription _PROTEIN_ were investigated alternative splicing and proteolytic activation . for the _LOCATION_ bound transcription _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ initially believed to be released from the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ by an unknown proteolytic cleavage it has been shown that under stress alternative splicing of the mrna transcript is performed by an _LOCATION_ bound rna splicing enzyme called inositol requiring enzyme _PROTEIN_ a dual functioning protein kinase . two genes encode _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis called _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . in order to test if alternative splicing was involved in the induction of _PROTEIN_ under aa treatment the increase in transcript abundance for _PROTEIN_ was measured in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ double mutants . it was evident that in each single mutant there was no difference in the induction of the _PROTEIN_ transcript while in the double mutants the induction of _PROTEIN_ transcript was double that observed in the wild type or single mutants . additionally amplification and sequencing of the _PROTEIN_ transcript revealed no difference between normal and stress conditions in _METHOD_ of alternative splicing or insertion of a stop codon before the predicted tm . thus it was concluded that alternative splicing of the _PROTEIN_ transcript was not the mechanism of activation . a variety of treatments were performed that have been previously used to inhibit the proteolytic release of _LOCATION_ bound transcription _PROTEIN_ in plants . col luc plants were treated with inhibitors targeting various proteases alln a plant protease inhibitor cocktail and phenanthroline . all these treatments failed to reduce the induction of luc activity in col luc or inhibit the induction of _PROTEIN_ transcript abundance under aa treatment . the _LOCATION_ stress response is characterized in plant and mammalian cells to be involved in protein release and modification events therefore chemicals known to induce the _LOCATION_ stress response were also tested for the ability to activate the aa responsive induction of _PROTEIN_ . tunicamycin a mixture of homologous compounds that prevent the first committed step of n linked glycosylation of proteins in the _LOCATION_ causes extensive protein misfolding and induces a slow motion _LOCATION_ stress response . treatment with tunicamycin resulted in normal _PROTEIN_ induction profiles in response to aa . interestingly treatment with dtt which induces a fast motion _LOCATION_ stress response by inhibiting disulfide bond formation in proteins resulted in no increase in luc activity or _PROTEIN_ transcript abundance in response to mitochondrial stress . finally using a t dna mutant of the site protease which previously had been shown to be required for the release of the _LOCATION_ tethered _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ transcription _PROTEIN_ did not compromise the induction of _PROTEIN_ . a group of proteases that are capable of proteolysis in a _LOCATION_ environment are rhomboid proteases . the first rhomboid substrate identified from drosophila melanogaster was an epidermal growth _PROTEIN_ ligand called spitz characterized by the seven amino acids highlighted in gray that are necessary and sufficient for cleavage . analyses of the sequence of _PROTEIN_ in the region of the tm domain revealed that it contains a similar motif except that ala a hydrophobic residue is replaced by leu another hydrophobic residue . it has been determined that structural features rather than sequence motifs define cleavage for rhomboid proteases and it appears that _PROTEIN_ contains all the features required for processing by a rhomboid protease . in order to test if a rhomboid protease was involved in activation of _PROTEIN_ cell cultures were treated with n p tosyl l phe chloromethyl a rhomboid protease inhibitor and the induction of _PROTEIN_ with aa treatment was assessed . the induction was reduced approximately fourfold by pretreatment with tpck indicating that cleavage by a rhomboid protease was the most likely mechanism of activation of _PROTEIN_ . to obtain additional evidence for proteolytic activation of _PROTEIN_ a construct was designed that was tagged with _METHOD_ at the n terminus and _METHOD_ at the c terminus . the hypothesis tested with this construct is that since the _METHOD_ is at the c terminus green _METHOD_ will be observed only in the _LOCATION_ as it will remain in the _LOCATION_ when the n terminal portion of _PROTEIN_ is released by proteolysis . furthermore since _METHOD_ is at the n terminus it is proposed that in addition to being located in the _LOCATION_ this fragment will also be relocated to the _LOCATION_ . finally upon treatment with aa the amount of _METHOD_ in the _LOCATION_ compared with the _LOCATION_ should increase . visualization of _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ in onion cells revealed that indeed green _METHOD_ was restricted to the _LOCATION_ network as observed in figure . however red _METHOD_ could be distinctly detected in the _LOCATION_ as well as the _LOCATION_ . no green _METHOD_ was detected in the _LOCATION_ although it could be seen as strands overlaying the _LOCATION_ . carrying out a similar experiment in the presence of aa revealed that without treatment red _METHOD_ was detected in both the _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ and with treatment it could be exclusively detected in the _LOCATION_ . again no green _METHOD_ was detected in the _LOCATION_ . additionally using this dual tagged construct with _METHOD_ proteins labeling actin and _LOCATION_ confirmed that while _METHOD_ coincides with the _LOCATION_ and actin the _METHOD_ was also located inside the _LOCATION_ with _LOCATION_ and/or actin on the outside of the _LOCATION_ . thus the combined evidence of the above approaches strongly indicates that activation of _PROTEIN_ occurs via proteolytic activation by a rhomboid protease releasing _PROTEIN_ from the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ to migrate to the _LOCATION_ . in order to investigate the extent of the transcriptional network regulated by this transcription _PROTEIN_ under the two model stress treatments changes in the transcriptome were examined using microarray analysis . while aa acts as an inhibitor of mitochondrial electron transport in addition to being produced in mitochondria by manganese superoxide dismutase from the more reactive superoxide radical can be produced by a variety of other cellular sources . analysis was performed on col luc as a wild type control the _METHOD_ mutant and the _PROTEIN_ t dna insertion knockout line . additionally transcriptomic profiles were examined in _PROTEIN_ which is predicted to be missing the tm region and thus is likely to produce a truncated protein targeted to the _LOCATION_ based on the localization studies . for both aa and stress treatments transcripts were cataloged into one of five gene list sets based on changes in transcript abundance in response to stress in wild type versus the mutant lines . for both treatments genes classified as group did not change in transcript abundance in response to stress in any lines tested _PROTEIN_ . group consists of genes that were stress responsive in col luc but for which changes in transcript abundance were not altered by and _PROTEIN_ mutation . genes from groups and were stress responsive and this transcriptional response to stress was mediated either positively or negatively through _PROTEIN_ functionality respectively . these genes represented in groups and make up the transcriptomic network regulated through _PROTEIN_ as the primary stress response in plant cells in response to general oxidative stress and specific mitochondrial dysfunction . the transcriptomic network that appears to be regulated through the functionality of _PROTEIN_ for the primary stress response at h comprises transcripts for aa and transcripts for . an additional group was also cataloged as it was noticed that particularly in response to aa treatment there were a number of transcripts that were nonresponsive in col luc plants at the time point tested but significantly responded to the stress treatment at this time point in the background . these groups of transcript could represent stress responsive transcripts that under normal conditions are regulated under a different response kinetic with the response timing affected in the background or they may represent downstream effects of the lack of functional _PROTEIN_ in the plants that results in an altered stress response in these plants . notably the proportion of these transcripts is relatively small compared with the defined stress response in col luc plants indicating minimal perturbation of the mutants under normal conditions . the proportions of the total stress responsive transcriptomic changes that are mediated through _PROTEIN_ function were examined for the two stress treatments compared with the percentage of stress response changes mediated independently of _PROTEIN_ function . strikingly _PROTEIN_ function was necessary and sufficient for the correct induction and repression of of transcripts genome wide that are involved in a primary response to and this can not be compensated for by other transcription _PROTEIN_ in plants lacking a functional _PROTEIN_ . furthermore this phenomenon was observed in the stress responses of two independent lines the _METHOD_ line and the _PROTEIN_ t dna knockout line showed remarkable overlap in transcriptomic profiles in response to with > of transcripts responding in a similar manner . by contrast only of the aa response could be attributed to function while the remaining of aa responsive transcripts _PROTEIN_ the correct induction and repression in the absence of a functional _PROTEIN_ . this indicates that aa treatment may recruit multiple signaling pathways from the mitochondria using numerous transcription _PROTEIN_ or signal transduction _METHOD_ that allow redundancy and other _PROTEIN_ to compensate for the absence of _PROTEIN_ on a genomic scale . to further investigate the molecular pathways and functional significance of the involvement of _PROTEIN_ particularly in the primary response to the transcripts significantly responding to in col luc plants that were affected by _PROTEIN_ function were visualized in mapman regulation overview pathways . the transcript and responses plotted here represent the stress network regulated through _PROTEIN_ function _PROTEIN_ under the conditions tested in this study . numerous transcription _PROTEIN_ were alternately regulated as were protein modification and degradation pathways . interestingly numerous transcripts involved with aba that are ubiquitously upregulated under stress were regulated through _PROTEIN_ function as were a number of mitogen activated protein kinases and many transcripts involved in calcium signaling . analysis of the genes positively regulated through the activity of under aa treatment revealed annotated as transcription _PROTEIN_ and five other nac transcription _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were in this group . none of these nac transcription _PROTEIN_ were predicted to contain a tm region . notably _PROTEIN_ is also within this list of stress responsive transcription _PROTEIN_ that are putatively positively regulated by _PROTEIN_ . under treatment of the genes that were defined as being positively regulated through the functionality of were annotated as transcription _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were in this group and again none are predicted to contain a tm region . furthermore analysis of the second t dna insertion line _PROTEIN_ that likely contains a constitutively _LOCATION_ localized _PROTEIN_ and has elevated levels of _PROTEIN_ transcript under untreated conditions provided insight into the extent of secondary regulatory networks provided by the transcription _PROTEIN_ that are directly regulated via _PROTEIN_ . transcripts that are altered in abundance in this background may represent components that are directly regulated via _PROTEIN_ due to the constitutive _LOCATION_ localization in this line . analysis of the bp promoter regions of the transcripts with altered abundance in the _PROTEIN_ line under normal conditions showed that > contain a consensus nac binding site in their promoters . among gene ontology annotations for transcripts with altered abundance in this line components involved in responses to biotic and abiotic stress were overrepresented and those in functional categories or cell organization biogenesis protein metabolism and development were underrepresented . additionally out of these transcripts encoded transcription _PROTEIN_ many of which have well established roles in the literature in _PROTEIN_ to integrating stress and energy metabolism and of these transcription _PROTEIN_ contain one or more consensus nac binding sites within their bp promoter regions . within this list of transcription _PROTEIN_ in order of magnitude of fold change are _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . furthermore all five of these nac transcription _PROTEIN_ contain one or more nac consensus binding sites within the promoter regions and are all likely to be involved in regulating downstream secondary responses to cellular stress with metabolic signals and other stress signals . _PROTEIN_ was also significantly upregulated in the _PROTEIN_ background under normal conditions . this transcription _PROTEIN_ has been linked with mediating and integrating cellular responses to abiotic and biotic stresses aba drought and cellular ros as a high level regulator . in order to gain a better understanding of the dependent and independent stress responsive changes changes observed were compared with common changes that occur under oxidative stress as defined previously and genes encoding mitochondrial proteins defined as stress responsive . in _METHOD_ of stress responsive mitochondrial components accounts for and of these changes under aa and treatment . from genes reported to change in the flu mutant ozone and methyl viologen of these transcripts were defined in this study as stress responsive and mediated via _PROTEIN_ function . from these analyses it appears that not only accounts for a large proportion of the driven changes in transcript abundance observed in this study but can also be seen to account for of the changes observed under various oxidative stress treatments from diverse cellular signals . whereas the above analysis suggests that _PROTEIN_ may act upstream of a variety of other transcription _PROTEIN_ to regulate stress responses it is unclear if this is due to _PROTEIN_ directly regulating these _PROTEIN_ or via intermediate pathways . we examined whether _PROTEIN_ could bind to the promoter regions of several transcription _PROTEIN_ that were found to be upregulated in transcript abundance in the _PROTEIN_ mutant line . specifically we tested cytokinin response _PROTEIN_ and belonging to the _PROTEIN_ family of transcription _PROTEIN_ and proposed to negatively regulate senescence during stress in arabidopsis and rice an _PROTEIN_ domain transcription _PROTEIN_ defined as a hypoxia induced transcription _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ defined as having a heat acclimation phenotype . all four promoters contained one or more cacg or caag putative core nac binding site . direct binding of _PROTEIN_ to putative nac binding motifs in all these promoters could be demonstrated suggesting that regulation by _PROTEIN_ is direct . mutation of the ca g sequence was sufficient to completely abolish binding . furthermore direct binding of _PROTEIN_ to the promoter of _PROTEIN_ could also be demonstrated . it has been previously shown that _PROTEIN_ mutant plants are more sensitive to drought stress combined with moderate light treatment compared with the wild type and do not recover after rewatering . as we have shown that is a regulator of _PROTEIN_ the effect of drought stress combined with moderate light on mutants was also investigated . exposure to moderate light during drought stress produced a notable difference in leaf color between col luc and _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ plants in that the wild type remained largely green in contrast with the other lines that were purple in color . previously under similar conditions it was shown that this was due to a fold increase in anthocyanins in _PROTEIN_ compared with wild type plants . notably appeared to behave as the wild type likely because of the constitutive _LOCATION_ localization of the _PROTEIN_ in this line . the purple pigmentation resulting from increased anthocyanin content was much greater in _PROTEIN_ and even greater in and _PROTEIN_ plants . both col luc and _PROTEIN_ survived the stress treatment and recovered after being returned to normal conditions while _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ plants died . analysis of cellular content of by staining with diaminobenzidine showed that there were no visible differences between nonstressed leaves of col luc and mutants however for there were substantially lower levels of diaminobenzidine precipitate indicating the response within these plants to a _LOCATION_ localized _PROTEIN_ protein results in lower ros production under normal conditions . no significant difference was observed when visualizing superoxide levels by staining with nitroblue tetrazolium . thus dysfunction of protein resulted in significantly reduced drought/moderate light stress tolerance possibly due to failed induction of _PROTEIN_ protein itself . by contrast a gain of function allele _PROTEIN_ with elevated _PROTEIN_ transcript levels did not exhibit a stress phenotype and had less cellular under normal conditions .

h at v on a bio rad protean ii gel system . a number of fusion proteins were constructed for this study . the cdnas of full length _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ minus the tm domain and the isolated tm of _PROTEIN_ were cloned in frame with _METHOD_ using gateway cloning as previously described . to track the dynamic relocalization of _PROTEIN_ following aa treatment gibson assembly was used to fuse _METHOD_ to the n terminus and _METHOD_ to the c terminus of full length _PROTEIN_ . the resulting chimeric insert was subsequently cloned into a destination vector using gateway cloning . constructs were transiently transformed into both arabidopsis suspension cell and onion epidermal cells using biolistic transformation as reported previously . in addition to the _METHOD_ constructs a series of organelle markers were employed including an _LOCATION_ targeted _METHOD_ a mitochondrial targeted _METHOD_ and the isolated actin binding domain of the _PROTEIN_ protein fused to _METHOD_ .

normalization for computing _METHOD_ intensity values used in differential _PROTEIN_ analyses . correlation plots were examined between all arrays using the scatterplot function in the partek genomics suite and in all cases r > . analysis of differential _PROTEIN_ was performed using a regularized t test based on a bayesian statistical framework using the software program cyber t . cyber t employs a mixture model based method described by citation for the computation of the global false positive and false negative levels inherent in a dna microarray experiment . to accurately control for false discovery rate and minimize false positives within the differential _PROTEIN_ analysis posterior probability of differential _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ values and posterior probability of differential _PROTEIN_ values were calculated as a means to measure the true discovery rate . changes in transcript abundance were considered significant with a posterior probability of differential _PROTEIN_ > and a _PROTEIN_ fold change > fold . details for the classification of transcripts into one of five gene lists based on the nature of the stress response in mutant backgrounds can be found in
