amidase _PROTEIN_ from arabidopsis thaliana converts indole acetamide into indole acetic acid . _PROTEIN_ is part of a small isogene family comprising seven members in a. thaliana encoding proteins which share a conserved glycine and serine rich amidase signature . one member of this family has been characterized as an n acylethanolamine cleaving fatty acid amidohydrolase _PROTEIN_ and two other members are part of the preprotein translocon of the outer envelope of chloroplasts or mitochondria and presumably lack enzymatic activity . among the hitherto characterized proteins of this family _PROTEIN_ is the only member with indole acetamide hydrolase activity and iam is the preferred substrate while n acylethanolamines and oleamide are not hydrolyzed significantly thus suggesting a role of _PROTEIN_ in auxin biosynthesis . whereas the enzymatic function of _PROTEIN_ has been determined in vitro the subcellular localization of the enzyme remained unclear . by using different _METHOD_ fusion constructs and an a. thaliana transient _PROTEIN_ system we show a cytoplasmic localization of _PROTEIN_ . in addition rt pcr and anti amidase antisera were used to examine tissue specific _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ at the transcriptional and translational level respectively . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is strongest in places of highest iaa content in the plant . thus it is concluded that _PROTEIN_ may be involved in de novo iaa synthesis in a. thaliana .
members of the amidase signature family are widespread in nature ranging from mammals to bacteria e.g . of the species rhodococcus or bradyrhizobium . even though the proteins in this family exhibit a variety of biological functions the core structure of the enzymes is highly conserved throughout the family . when examining the proteome of the model plant a. thaliana one can find seven putative members of this enzyme superfamily all comprising the characteristic eponymous glycine and serine rich amidase signature motif . the construction of a phylogenetic tree revealed the clustering of the arabidopsis amidase signature proteins into two sub groups and additionally two single proteins . the first group encompasses _PROTEIN_ and a so far uncharacterized protein _GENE_ . the second group contains _PROTEIN_ along with the proteins iii and _PROTEIN_ . the two remaining enzymes do not cluster in another group but rather branch directly from the origin . preliminary studies suggested a _LOCATION_ localization for _PROTEIN_ since the immunological signal was exclusively found in the soluble fraction of protein preparations . nevertheless these data are not sufficient to prove a cytoplasmic localization nor do they exclude _PROTEIN_ from organelles which could have been disrupted during the preparation procedure thus releasing their soluble proteins . some recent publications assumed a possible _LOCATION_ or mitochondrial localization of _PROTEIN_ associating _PROTEIN_ with two proteins iii and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ based on their primary amino acid sequence homology emphasized by the clustering of the three proteins into one branch of a phylogenetic tree . however these assumptions were solely based on in silico studies and thus ambiguous . here we demonstrate unequivocally that _PROTEIN_ is located in the cytoplasm of plant cells transiently _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion constructs . to study _PROTEIN_ localization clones in which _METHOD_ was fused to the end of the _PROTEIN_ cdna were initially constructed and _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was analyzed with a confocal laser scanning microscope after introduction of the plasmid construct by particle bombardment into to week old arabidopsis seedlings . coexpression of either _METHOD_ alone or dsred fused to the _LOCATION_ localization site of _PROTEIN_ served as controls the latter for _LOCATION_ targeting . whereas the _METHOD_ protein alone showed an expected cytoplasmic as well as a _LOCATION_ localization and dsred fused to the nls of _PROTEIN_ was targeted to the _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion proteins were found in the cytoplasm and intriguingly to some extent in the _LOCATION_ . considering a calculated molecular weight of the fusion protein of approximately kda an unspecific localization of _PROTEIN_ in the _LOCATION_ in consequence of a diffusion process through _LOCATION_ pores seemed unlikely but not impossible as earlier reports e.g . by saslowsky et al . showed identical findings . addressing the question of a specific targeting of _PROTEIN_ to the _LOCATION_ a second _METHOD_ construct was generated which contained a gus gene inserted between the _PROTEIN_ and the _METHOD_ coding sequences in order to increase the apparent size of the fusion protein . the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ in cells receiving this second _METHOD_ construct and at the same time a _LOCATION_ localization positive control _PROTEIN_ dsred showed an exclusive localization of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ in the cytoplasm and dsred _METHOD_ in the _LOCATION_ . the _PROTEIN_ gus _METHOD_ fusion protein exhibiting a calculated molecular weight of ca . kda apparently is no longer able to enter the _LOCATION_ . rather _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was found restricted to the cytoplasm and the cytoplasmic pocket harboring the _LOCATION_ thus eliminating the possibility of specific _LOCATION_ import of the fusion protein and by inference of _PROTEIN_ itself . furthermore no particular affinity of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion polypeptide to either chloroplasts or mitochondria was observed . therefore a participation of _PROTEIN_ in the chloroplastidic or the mitochondrial protein import machineries can be ruled out . this conclusion is further underlined by the lack of a tetratricopeptide repeat motif in _PROTEIN_ which _METHOD_ to be a characteristic domain mediating protein protein interaction in the two translocon associated members of the amidase signature protein family iii and _PROTEIN_ . in the initial work proposing _PROTEIN_ as an enzyme converting iam to iaa thus being of particular interest for plant auxin biosynthesis we documented that _PROTEIN_ cdna was obtained by rt pcr from leaf tissues . the mrna level of _PROTEIN_ in this tissue seemed fairly constant in plants between and weeks after germination . to obtain more detailed information and to compare the _PROTEIN_ pattern of _PROTEIN_ and the related isogene _PROTEIN_ total rna was extracted from different tissues of a. thaliana . as the _PROTEIN_ level of _PROTEIN_ was expected to be too low to be detected by northern blot analysis rt pcr was used to analyze the specific _PROTEIN_ patterns of the two genes in different organs . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was found in all tissues analyzed albeit at different levels . highest transcript levels were found in flowers and young sink leaves . as depicted in fig . a similar profile for the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is found using the _PROTEIN_ database server . this _PROTEIN_ pattern is compatible with a role of _PROTEIN_ in auxin de novo biosynthesis which is supposed to take place in tissues with highest meristematic activity . intriguingly _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is highest in areas of high iaa content in the plant as visualized in the iaa map created by et al . for a. thaliana . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was highest in flowers lower in roots and still lower in sink leaves while unlike _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mrna was not detected in source leaves _METHOD_ and siliques emphasizing differential functions for the two gene products . analysis of transcript levels alone does not allow to draw conclusions about the levels of the corresponding polypeptides as for example protein turnover in different plant tissues or organs can be variable . therefore protein extracts from different plant tissues were prepared and their _PROTEIN_ content was analyzed by immunodetection utilizing a further developed previously described anti _PROTEIN_ serum . the levels of _PROTEIN_ protein in the different organs indeed differ somewhat from the transcript levels described above . whereas high _PROTEIN_ levels in sink leaves reflected the transcriptional situation the immunological detection revealed very low amounts of _PROTEIN_ in all other tissues analyzed . the major difference between transcript and protein levels was found in flowers where _PROTEIN_ transcript levels are comparable to those in sink leaves . in root tissue rt pcr experiments showed low levels of _PROTEIN_ mrna while in western blots _PROTEIN_ polypeptide was not detectable . interestingly in contrast to all other immunoreactivity is represented as a faint double band . thus leaving open the possibility of a post translational modification of the amidase polypeptide in this specific tissue . in the plant kingdom only two members of the amidase signature family of hydrolytic enzymes are assigned for their specific enzymatic function so far . the first identified enzyme was _PROTEIN_ the second a fatty acid amide hydrolase _PROTEIN_ capable of converting n acylethanolamine to ethanolamine and the free acid . moreover it had previously been demonstrated that orthologous _PROTEIN_ also cleave fatty acid derivatives like oleamide releasing fatty acids and ammonia . in the first study on _PROTEIN_ neither fatty acid amides nor n acylethanolamines were tested as potential substrates and as a consequence a function of _PROTEIN_ as a _PROTEIN_ can not be excluded . thus the substrate specificities of the two recombinant proteins were compared in this study . whereas the a. thaliana _PROTEIN_ showed a very narrow substrate spectrum more or less refusing all offered substrates except n acylethanolamines and oleamide _PROTEIN_ shows to be specific for iam but the enzyme shows high activity also with naphthaleneacetamide _PROTEIN_ a compound which is not occurring in plants . however the cleavage product naphthaleneacetic acid is a strong synthetic auxin in plants . interestingly auxin activity has been reported for _PROTEIN_ . our results show that the auxin activity may not reside in _PROTEIN_ itself even more so that _PROTEIN_ does not follow thimann s nm rule for auxin activity but that it may result from naa liberated from _PROTEIN_ via iam hydrolases .
if not stated otherwise all experiments were carried out using a. thaliana heynh . col . all plant organs were harvested from plants grown in a greenhouse on a mixture of soil and sand for weeks in short days . thereafter plants were transferred to long day conditions . the greenhouse was _PROTEIN_ under constant climatic conditions during daytime and over night . the photosynthetically active radiation _PROTEIN_ was no less than photons . all molecular techniques were performed using standard protocols according to sambrook et al . or ausubel et al . . to generate vectors for _METHOD_ analysis in transiently transformed plant cells the _PROTEIN_ cassettes containing the genes of the two _METHOD_ proteins _METHOD_ and dsred were excised with hindiii/ecori from the vectors _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ respectively and integrated into the hindiii/ecori site of the vector pqe which was first modified by xbai/nhei restriction followed by religation to eliminate an additional xbai site resulting in psp _METHOD_ and psp dsred . to create a control construct _PROTEIN_ dsred for proteins with _LOCATION_ localization a fragment of cryptochrome was amplified which encodes the c terminal amino acids . these are sufficient for _LOCATION_ import as shown by kleiner et al . . in the course of pcr restriction sites for saci and kpni were added to the cdna fragment which were afterwards used for fusing the _PROTEIN_ fragment with the dsred gene in psp dsred . besides the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ vector _METHOD_ a second construct with an additional gus gene in front of the _METHOD_ coding sequence was produced . to achieve this the gus gene was amplified by pcr thus adding sali and psti restriction sites that allowed cloning into the multiple cloning site of psp _METHOD_ using the enzyme combination sali and psti . finally the cdna region encoding amidase _PROTEIN_ was amplified by pcr from a plasmid template containing the corresponding cdna using gene specific primers _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ with additional spei and xhoi sites . this fragment was cloned into the xbai and sali restriction sites of psp _METHOD_ and pegg making use of the compatible ends of spei/xbai and xhoi/sali respectively resulting in psp _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and pegg amif . the sequences of all nucleotide fragments obtained by pcr as well as the translational fusions of the cdna fragments were verified by commercial dna sequencing _PROTEIN_ . four to six week old a. thaliana seedlings grown under sterile conditions on solidified _METHOD_ medium supplemented with sucrose in petri dishes were bombarded with gold particles at bar pressure . the particles were emitted from a particle inflow gun as described by finer et al . . the conditions for the bombardment of plant cells were set to bar chamber vacuum cm distance of particle outlet to the dispersive grid and cm distance to the plantlets . after bombardment the plants were kept under constant conditions _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ for day . single leaves of the transformed seedlings were then analyzed with the confocal laser scanning system zeiss lsm meta . excitation light of nm produced by a krypton/argon laser allowed the simultaneous detection of _METHOD_ mediated and chlorophyll mediated _METHOD_ using a meta detector system with emission filters set to nm for _METHOD_ and nm for the chlorophyll _METHOD_ respectively . an additional excitation of the samples at nm permitted a concurrent analysis of dsred derived _METHOD_ by recording the light passing an emission filter in the range of nm . total rna was prepared from mg of plant tissue . the samples were homogenized in ml of trizol reagent in a prechilled mortar . for rt pcr analysis total rna was extracted and converted to cdna by using m mlv reverse transcriptase with oligo d primers according to the manufacturer s instructions . thereafter genomic dna residuals were eliminated by a dnase treatment of min following the manufacturer s advices . two cdna fragments of bp _PROTEIN_ and bp _PROTEIN_ respectively were amplified from ng of total rna by pcr cycles using intron spanning specific primer sets for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ allowing to distinguish between genomic dna and cdna . as controls cdna fragments with sizes of bp _PROTEIN_ bp and bp of constitutively _PROTEIN_ genes representing respectively actin elongation _PROTEIN_ and eukaryotic translation initiation _PROTEIN_ were simultaneously amplified from ng total rna by pcr cycles with the following likewise intron spanning oligonucleotide pairs _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ ef _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . to ensure a linear range of pcr amplification the amount of initial mrna used was varied ng for low abundant _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ fragments or ng for the control fragments respectively . recombinant fatty acid amide hydrolase _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ in escherichia coli _PROTEIN_ harboring the _PROTEIN_ vector containing the full length _PROTEIN_ cdna kindly provided by dr. rhidaya shrestha and dr. kent d. chapman as described by shrestha et al . . hexahistidine tagged amidase _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ in e. coli harboring the vector pqe with a bamhi/sali integrated _PROTEIN_ cdna according to the manufacturer s protocol with the following exceptions bacterial cultures were incubated at until they reached an of . thereafter they were transferred to and protein _PROTEIN_ was induced by adding iptg . hereafter the cultures were incubated for another h at before the proteins were harvested . to prepare tissue specific plant protein extracts for subsequent assays organs were harvested from to week old plants and homogenized in ml prechilled extraction buffer . the extract was filtered through miracloth and centrifuged at for min . the resulting supernatants were desalted using pd columns equilibrated in mm potassium phosphate buffer ph and consecutively concentrated by ultrafiltration with the help of centricon ym units . afterwards the samples were centrifuged at for min separating the soluble proteins from the microsomal fraction . after determination of the protein concentration of protein from the soluble fraction of each tissue was precipitated with three volumes of meoh and the proteins were separated by exponential gradient _PROTEIN_ . the enzymatic activity of the recombinant amidohydrolases was determined by monitoring the release of ammonia during the reaction as previously described . in brief the different substrates were incubated with of purified protein in mm potassium phosphate buffer at ph at in a total volume of ml . for background control heat denatured enzyme was used . after h of incubation aliquots of ml were taken and the reaction was stopped by adding ml each of m sodium phenolate m sodium hypochlorite and sodium pentacyanonitrosyl ferrate . after incubating for min at each sample was diluted with ml of water and the absorbance was read at nm . each experiment was calibrated utilizing solutions of known concentrations . in case of analyzing the and n acylethanolamine conversion the amount of enzymatically produced free fatty acids was examined . for this reason affinity purified protein was incubated with mm substrate over a time period of h at in mm potassium phosphate buffer in a total reaction volume of ml . thereafter the reaction was stopped by acidifying with of m hcl . produced free fatty acids were twice extracted with ml of chloroform and the combined solution was then brought to dryness . the precipitate was re dissolved in methanol treated with ml ethereal diazomethane and subsequently the solvent was removed under a gentle stream of nitrogen . the methylated samples were then taken up in chloroform and transferred to gc vials . the gc _METHOD_ analysis was performed according to stelmach et al . . typical retention times were as follows hexadecanoic acid min octadecadienoic acid min . the amount of free fatty acids was calculated by comparing results to external standards of known concentrations . as a negative control a tryptic digest of the sample protein was used . protein concentrations were determined according to bradford with bovine serum albumin as protein standard . plant protein extracts were separated by _PROTEIN_ polyacrylamide gradient gels as described by scharf and nover . to visualize the separated proteins in the gels they were stained with _METHOD_ brilliant blue . for immunoblotting the polypeptides were transferred to nitrocellulose after their electrophoretical separation . the immunological detection of _PROTEIN_ was carried out according to pollmann et al . with an anti _PROTEIN_ serum used at a final dilution of . the difference in anti serum dilution is due to the development of the serum over the boosting time . the serum for these experiments was taken after the boost of the rabbit instead of serum harvested after the boost in the publication mentioned above
