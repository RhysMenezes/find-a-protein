_LOCATION_ desaturase _PROTEIN_ is a major contributor to trienoic fatty acid biosynthesis in the leaves of arabidopsis plants . however the precise contribution of the other _LOCATION_ desaturase _PROTEIN_ is poorly understood . fatty acid and lipid analysis of several desaturase mutants including two insertion lines of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ showed that _PROTEIN_ partially compensated the disruption of the _PROTEIN_ gene at indicating that _PROTEIN_ was active at this growth temperature contrasting to previous observations that _METHOD_ the _PROTEIN_ activity at low temperatures . our data revealed that _PROTEIN_ had a higher selectivity for acyl lipid substrates and a higher preference for lipids other than galactolipids particularly phosphatidylglycerol at any of the temperatures studied . differences in the mechanism controlling _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ gene _PROTEIN_ at different temperatures were also detected . confocal microscopy and biochemical analysis of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ over _PROTEIN_ lines confirmed the chloroplast envelope localization of _PROTEIN_ . co localization experiments suggested that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ might be located in close vicinity in the envelope _LOCATION_ . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ over _PROTEIN_ lines showed a specific increase in fatty acids at . together these results indicate that the function of both _LOCATION_ desaturases is coordinated in a non redundant manner .
a search for single _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ ethyl methanesulfonate _METHOD_ mutants at the nasc repository resulted in a single _PROTEIN_ mutant but no single _PROTEIN_ locus accession . on the contrary several t dna insertion lines mutated in the _LOCATION_ desaturases were recovered from the nasc repository . only two of them showed insertions exclusively in the _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ genes and were further characterized . these lines were designated as _PROTEIN_ and designated as _PROTEIN_ . genomic analysis of _PROTEIN_ plants revealed two insertions of an inverted tandem t dna in the _PROTEIN_ gene one located at bp downstream of exon and the other located within intron at bp downstream of the end of exon . genomic analysis of _PROTEIN_ plants showed insertion of an inverted tandem t dna bp downstream of the start codon within exon of the _PROTEIN_ gene . characterization of week old _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ plants indicated the absence of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ transcripts in the corresponding mutants . homozygous _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutant lines were segregated and further analyzed . none of the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ plants showed any significant alterations in growth at control temperatures developing normal rosette leaves . they germinated normally and grew in soil producing seeds like the rest of the plant lines used in this study with the exception of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutant which was sterile and did not produce seeds except when treated with jasmonic acid . the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutants have been described previously . they derived from single _METHOD_ mutants that were crossed to obtain both the double _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and triple _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutants . we further characterized these mutants at the genetic level . the _PROTEIN_ mutation from the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant has been characterized previously . sequencing of the _PROTEIN_ gene in either genomic or cdna from the double _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutant confirmed these results showing a point mutation of g for a _PROTEIN_ substitution in residue of the _PROTEIN_ protein . on the contrary we were not able to find any sequencing data for the _PROTEIN_ mutation . sequencing of the _PROTEIN_ gene in either genomic or cdna from the double _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutant showed a point mutation that introduced a substitution of g for a _PROTEIN_ in residue of the _PROTEIN_ protein . sequencing analysis of the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ genes in the triple mutant showed identical substitutions to those found in the double _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutant . finally sequencing of the _PROTEIN_ gene in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutant resulted in a mutation of g for a . this introduced a substitution of c for y in residue of the mature protein . it is worth mentioning that this residue is part of the first his box essential for desaturase function . we analyzed the fatty acid composition of total leaf lipids from col and the different mutant lines grown at for weeks . average ta levels in col were of linolenic acid and of hexadecatrienoic acid of linoleic and of hexadecadienoic acid were also detected . these values were within the range previously observed for the col line . disruption of the _PROTEIN_ gene in the _PROTEIN_ mutant resulted in a reduction of tas with an content of and an even more reduced content of down to . these average percentages indicated that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ of production with respect to col while only of synthesis was _PROTEIN_ in this mutant . on the contrary disruption of the _PROTEIN_ gene in _PROTEIN_ resulted in ta levels almost similar to those from col . the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant also showed a considerable reduction in ta particularly in which was undetectable . levels of were also reduced to in this mutant indicating that in the absence of _LOCATION_ desaturase activity _PROTEIN_ accounted for approximately of the synthesized with respect to that from col . it is worth mentioning that this reduction in tas was even greater than that previously reported in for their double _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutant . finally the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ triple mutant showed no accumulation of tas consistent with the disruption of all fatty acid desaturase genes . the absence of tas was accompanied by a strong increase in das which reached average percentages of of and of . given the strong reduction in content observed in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant the data obtained in _PROTEIN_ indicated that after disruption of the _PROTEIN_ gene _PROTEIN_ enzymatic activity was able to _PROTEIN_ at least partially the amount of and to a much lesser extent that of at . to investigate the effect of the disruption of the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ genes on the lipid profiles in more detail _PROTEIN_ lipid classes were separated by bi dimensional thin layer chromatography and their fatty acid composition was determined by gas chromatography . the lipid composition in the col plants was similar to that reported previously . no relevant modifications in the amount of lipids were observed in the different mutant lines at . this result is consistent with previous observations in other fatty acid desaturase mutants . the fatty acid composition of each lipid class in col and mutant lines is shown in . monogalactosyldiacylglycerol showed a high content of and in col with percentages of and respectively . mgdg from the _PROTEIN_ mutant showed a and reduction of and respectively compared with col whereas the disruption of the _PROTEIN_ gene resulted in minor changes in the fatty acid composition of mgdg . as observed in total lipids very low amounts of were detected in mgdg from the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant while was undetectable . similarly neither nor were detected in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ triple mutant . comparison of the ta content in mgdg of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutants at indicated that in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ activity was capable of partially _PROTEIN_ the content of mgdg while its capacity to _PROTEIN_ levels was very much reduced . a similar conclusion could be reached from the analysis of digalactosyldiacylglycerol or phosphatidylcholine having in _PROTEIN_ that dgdg has highly reduced levels even in col and pc has no . on the contrary different results were obtained when phosphatidylglycerol was analyzed . as shown in b levels in col pg were around while in the _PROTEIN_ mutant it reached a reduction compared with col . interestingly disruption of the _PROTEIN_ gene resulted in even lower levels of in pg of from total fatty acids . an even stronger reduction of was observed in pg from the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant . this pg found in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant probably originated from extraplastidial biosynthesis of pg in the _LOCATION_ . finally no was detected in pg from the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ triple mutant . these results suggested that at disruption of the _PROTEIN_ gene affected the content of the pg fraction more than that of the _PROTEIN_ gene . the effect of low and high temperatures on leaf lipid fatty acid composition in col and the different mutant lines was also investigated . no significant modifications in the leaf content from total lipids isolated from col or the different mutant lines were detected upon exposure to for week compared with . analysis of mgdg dgdg or pg further confirmed the absence of significant changes in the leaf ta content upon exposure to low temperatures with the exception of pc for which a _PROTEIN_ of was detected in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . the leaf fatty acid composition from total lipids of col was not greatly affected by their exposure to . on the contrary a reduction in ta levels was observed in total lipids from all mutant lines . fatty acids from total lipids of _PROTEIN_ showed an important _PROTEIN_ in both and . these values meant an average reduction of and content of and respectively compared with col . this reduction in ta levels in _PROTEIN_ at was more pronounced than that detected for the same line at . a reduction of ta in the _PROTEIN_ mutant was also detected at . as shown in a and _PROTEIN_ to and respectively . these results represented a and reduction for and respectively compared with col at the same temperature . these data indicated that _PROTEIN_ was more affected than _PROTEIN_ at . a similar conclusion could be drawn from the analysis of the fatty acid composition of individual lipid classes . the content in mgdg showed no significant modification upon exposure of col plants to compared with the same line at . in contrast the content in mgdg was more affected with a _PROTEIN_ compared with col at . the ta content of the mgdg from the _PROTEIN_ mutant showed a strong _PROTEIN_ of and upon exposure to down to and respectively . these values meant an average reduction of and in the and content of mgdg respectively with respect to the same line grown at . in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ down to and respectively . these values represented an average reduction of and in the and content respectively with respect to the same line at . these data suggested that _PROTEIN_ activity on mgdg substrates was more affected by exposure to than _PROTEIN_ activity . this conclusion could be extended to other lipids such as dgdg pc or sulfoquinovosyldiacylglycerol . the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant also showed a _PROTEIN_ in content of mgdg indicating that _PROTEIN_ activity had little or no effect on the fatty acid composition of mgdg at high temperatures . finally the amount of ta in pg _PROTEIN_ in all plants analyzed compared with including col in which a _PROTEIN_ from to was detected . in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ strongly _PROTEIN_ to levels very similar to those from the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant . we decided to correlate the differences found in the fatty acid composition of the different mutant lines with the _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ genes . quantitative pcr _PROTEIN_ analysis of these genes in leaves from col and mutant plants grown at or upon exposure to or for week are shown in . since the triple mutant did not accumulate tas the _PROTEIN_ analysis was focused in those plant lines in which changes in tas were detected . at transcripts from _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ genes were detected in leaves from week old col plants . t dna insertion provoked the absence of _PROTEIN_ mrna in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . very small amounts of _PROTEIN_ mrna were detected in the _PROTEIN_ mutant in the q pcr analysis . this small amount of _PROTEIN_ mrna might represent truncated _METHOD_ of the transcript that are detected in the q pcr analysis since the primers were designed in the n terminal region of the protein . this was done to avoid cross amplification with the highly homologous _PROTEIN_ gene . disruption of the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ genes in the insertion mutants did not result in significant changes in the transcript levels of the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ genes respectively . similarly disruption of one or both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ genes did not modify the transcript levels of the _LOCATION_ desaturase _PROTEIN_ . interestingly this absence of compensatory responses at the transcriptional level was also observed when the _PROTEIN_ of the genes encoding fatty acid desaturases was analyzed at either a low or high temperature . then we focused our analysis on the col line where the three _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ genes were normally _PROTEIN_ . col plants exposed to for week showed a two fold increase in _PROTEIN_ mrna compared with control plants . this increase was accompanied by a reduction in the _PROTEIN_ transcript levels at low temperatures . these changes in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ transcripts detected at were not accompanied by changes in _PROTEIN_ mrna . on the other hand col plants exposed to showed a significant _PROTEIN_ in the _PROTEIN_ transcript with respect to control plants . this could be consistent with the higher sensitivity of _PROTEIN_ activity at . the presence of a chloroplast transit peptide in the _PROTEIN_ gene sequence suggested that the _PROTEIN_ protein might be located in the _LOCATION_ . to investigate _PROTEIN_ function at the protein level we first analyzed its sub cellular localization generating stable transgenic arabidopsis lines _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ gene fused to _METHOD_ at its c terminus under the control of a constitutive promoter . transgenic lines generated with the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ construct showed a strong _METHOD_ _METHOD_ signal associated with chloroplasts from leaves that was absent in leaves from plants carrying the empty vector . this _METHOD_ signal was found in chloroplasts from mesophyll cells as well as in the small chloroplasts from guard cells . the _METHOD_ signal was not uniform but detected at specific spots or foci on the chloroplast . to confirm these results we performed transient _PROTEIN_ experiments in nicotiana benthamiana leaves . the transiently _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein showed an abundant _METHOD_ signal associated with _LOCATION_ further corroborating the _LOCATION_ localization of _PROTEIN_ . the signal showed the same pattern of accumulation in foci as occurred in the stable transgenic lines . a similar pattern of small dots on the surface of the chloroplast was also obtained when _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ were used instead of _METHOD_ suggesting that the pattern observed for _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was not due to the nature of the _METHOD_ tag . this pattern of localization in discrete foci is shared with many other proteins localized in the _LOCATION_ and more specifically in the _LOCATION_ envelope _PROTEIN_ under the control of either constitutive or endogenous promoters . to analyze this in detail _PROTEIN_ was used as a control of envelope localization . _PROTEIN_ is a component of the _PROTEIN_ translocon and is localized in the inner envelope _LOCATION_ of the chloroplast . it has been previously used as a tool for in vivo chloroplast envelope localizations . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was transiently _PROTEIN_ in n. benthamiana leaves . as shown in j and we obtained green small dots structures associated with chloroplast _METHOD_ . this pattern was similar to that reported by for the same protein and that obtained for our _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ construct supporting the envelope localization of _PROTEIN_ . to further confirm the _LOCATION_ localization of the _PROTEIN_ protein biochemical fractionation of chloroplasts was carried out followed by immunoblotting with an anti _METHOD_ antibody that also recognizes the _METHOD_ protein . chloroplasts from leaves of week old arabidopsis plants grown at carrying both the empty vector and the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ construct were analyzed . a strong band at the appropriate molecular weight for the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein was detected in the transgenic extracts while no signal was observed in plants carrying the empty vector . minor bands around kda could also be detected probably corresponding to processed _METHOD_ protein . the resolution of the confocal microscope can not inform us about the precise localization of the _PROTEIN_ protein within the different chloroplast sub compartments . therefore the sub chloroplast _LOCATION_ distribution of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein was sought . to that end plants were grown for weeks under short light period conditions to favor rosette leaf formation and intact chloroplasts were isolated through percoll gradient centrifugation . intact chloroplasts were lysed and envelope stroma and _LOCATION_ fractions were separated through sucrose gradient centrifugation . fractions were blotted using an anti _METHOD_ antibody to detect the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein . several antibodies were used as specific markers of the different chloroplast sub fractions . _PROTEIN_ rubisco and the photosystem ii subunit were used as markers of the envelope stroma and _LOCATION_ respectively . the results are shown in b . the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein was detected in the envelope fraction with no detection in the soluble stroma fraction or in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein distribution was similar to that of _PROTEIN_ the envelope marker indicating that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was located in the _LOCATION_ envelope . at this point we analyzed whether both _LOCATION_ desaturases _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ showed similar or different localization patterns in the _LOCATION_ . to that end we performed transient _PROTEIN_ experiments in n. benthamiana leaves in which a _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ construct was co transformed with a _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ construct . as shown in the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signal was also detected in small dots or foci on the surface of the chloroplasts from n. benthamiana showing a similar accumulation pattern to that observed for _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . these results suggested that both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ desaturases showed a similar pattern of localization in the _LOCATION_ envelope . special care was taken to confirm that no _METHOD_ signal was detected through the _METHOD_ channel or vice versa under our experimental conditions . interestingly when both _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signals were merged many of the spots seemed to overlap suggesting that both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ desaturases could be located in close vicinity within the _LOCATION_ . to gain further insight into the function of the _PROTEIN_ protein the fatty acid composition from total lipids was analyzed in the previously characterized _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ over _PROTEIN_ arabidopsis lines in which the _PROTEIN_ protein was located in the _LOCATION_ envelope . as shown in a total lipids from different _PROTEIN_ over _PROTEIN_ lines showed an increase in levels compared with the plants _PROTEIN_ the empty vector . interestingly no modification in fatty acids was observed . this result might be consistent with the data obtained from the analysis of the insertion lines that suggested that _PROTEIN_ might be more specific on rather than substrates . the effect on lipid classes of the over _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ gene was also studied . the transgenic event with the highest increase in was further analyzed . no changes in the or content from the galactolipids mgdg or dgdg was observed in the _PROTEIN_ over _PROTEIN_ lines further confirming the results obtained in the insertion mutants . different results were obtained when the phospholipids were analyzed . as shown in b pg showed a increase in levels in the _PROTEIN_ over _PROTEIN_ plants . this increase was concomitant with the _PROTEIN_ in indicating a higher desaturase activity . surprisingly a lipid like pc _PROTEIN_ present in the _LOCATION_ also showed an increase in levels in the _PROTEIN_ over _PROTEIN_ lines compared with the plants carrying the empty vector . this increase was again accompanied by a _PROTEIN_ in levels . this increase in in extraplastidic lipids was also observed in other lipids such as phosphatidylethanolamine or phosphatidylinositol . finally sulfolipids also showed a small but significant increase in in the _PROTEIN_ over _PROTEIN_ lines .
the lines of arabidopsis thaliana used were descended from the columbia ecotype . two insertional mutants from salk were used _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . these insertion lines were selected after discarding other plant lines carrying insertions in loci other than _PROTEIN_ . we also used a double _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutant from nasc and a triple mutant _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ a kind gift

were obtained from the analysis of three independent biological experiments with at least three technical repeats for each experiment . the _PROTEIN_ coding sequence was amplified by pcr using the

change the stop codon to alanine . pcr reactions were performed with phusion high fidelity dna polymerase _METHOD_ according to the manufacturer 's instructions . pentr vector construction was also performed according to the manufacturer 's instructions _METHOD_ and used for escherichia coli transformation . the _PROTEIN_ gene now flanked by the appropriate attl sites was sub cloned into the
