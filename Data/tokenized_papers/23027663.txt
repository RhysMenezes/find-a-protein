like many other viruses tobacco mosaic virus replicates in association with the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and exploits this _LOCATION_ network for intercellular spread through plasmodesmata a process depending on virus encoded movement protein _PROTEIN_ . the movement process involves interactions of _PROTEIN_ with the _LOCATION_ and the _LOCATION_ as well as its targeting to pd . _PROTEIN_ in the infection cycle the _PROTEIN_ further accumulates and localizes to _LOCATION_ associated inclusions the viral _PROTEIN_ and along microtubules before it is finally degraded . although these patterns of _PROTEIN_ accumulation have been described in great detail the underlying _METHOD_ that control _PROTEIN_ fate and function during infection are not known . here we identify cell division cycle _PROTEIN_ a conserved chaperone controlling protein fate in yeast and animal cells by extracting protein substrates from _LOCATION_ or complexes as a cellular _PROTEIN_ regulating _PROTEIN_ accumulation patterns in plant cells . we demonstrate that arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ is induced upon infection interacts with _PROTEIN_ in _LOCATION_ inclusions dependent on the _PROTEIN_ n terminus and promotes degradation of the protein . we further provide evidence that _PROTEIN_ extracts _PROTEIN_ from _LOCATION_ inclusions to the _LOCATION_ where it subsequently accumulates on and stabilizes microtubules . we show that virus movement is impaired upon overexpression of _PROTEIN_ suggesting that _PROTEIN_ further functions in controlling virus movement by removal of _PROTEIN_ from the _LOCATION_ transport pathway and by promoting interference of _PROTEIN_ with microtubule dynamics . _PROTEIN_ acts also in response to other proteins _PROTEIN_ in the _LOCATION_ thus suggesting a general role of _PROTEIN_ in _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ upon _LOCATION_ stress .
first evidence for a role of _PROTEIN_ during tmv infection came from pull down experiments using recombinant _PROTEIN_ and tobacco suspension cell extract in which we identified a putative tobacco _PROTEIN_ specifically retained by _PROTEIN_ . studies in yeast and mammals have shown that _PROTEIN_ plays a role in the retrotranslocation of proteins from the _LOCATION_ to the _LOCATION_ during _LOCATION_ assisted protein degradation _LOCATION_ . although _PROTEIN_ function in plants is much less understood there is evidence that a _PROTEIN_ dependent _LOCATION_ like pathway for the degradation of misfolded _LOCATION_ proteins also exists in plants . as tmv and related tobamoviruses replicate in association with the _LOCATION_ and infection leads to the formation of _LOCATION_ associated inclusions that accumulate _PROTEIN_ in advance of _PROTEIN_ degradation we suspected that _PROTEIN_ activity might play a role in regulating _PROTEIN_ fate . to test this further we first analyzed the _PROTEIN_ of the three different arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ during infection with the tmv related oilseed rape mosaic virus . in contrast to tmv ormv readily infects arabidopsis and induces strong disease _METHOD_ in this host . indeed _PROTEIN_ was strongly induced in arabidopsis plants undergoing systemic infection . _PROTEIN_ was induced at two tested time points after virus inoculation whereas the more highly _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ gene was only moderately induced and _PROTEIN_ transcript levels remained largely constant at both time points . the virus induced induction of _PROTEIN_ is in agreement with our independent microarray analysis of transcript levels upon ormv infection and other publicly available microarray data describing _PROTEIN_ transcript levels in the presence of different environmental stresses indicating that _PROTEIN_ represents the _PROTEIN_ stress responsive _PROTEIN_ isoform in arabidopsis . virus infection has been shown to induce _LOCATION_ stress and the _PROTEIN_ of _LOCATION_ resident chaperones to enhance the protein folding capacity in the _LOCATION_ . to verify whether also tobamoviruses induce _LOCATION_ stress we analyzed the _PROTEIN_ levels of the _LOCATION_ luminal chaperones binding _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis plants systemically infected with ormv . indeed in virus infected compared with mock inoculated samples _PROTEIN_ of both chaperones was induced fold and fold respectively . comparison of _PROTEIN_ levels of _LOCATION_ stress responsive chaperones lectins and transcription _PROTEIN_ in biologically independent arabidopsis transcriptome data of ormv infected and mock inoculated plants further validated this finding and thus indicated the induction of _LOCATION_ stress and enhanced protein quality surveillance in virus infected tissues . the observed induction of _PROTEIN_ may thus be linked to the induction of _LOCATION_ stress in virus infected tissues . to address a general role of _PROTEIN_ in relation to _LOCATION_ stress in vivo we _PROTEIN_ the protein in fusion to _METHOD_ or red _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ and analyzed its subcellular localization in nicotiana benthamiana epidermal cells by confocal _METHOD_ microscopy . we found the protein localized in the _LOCATION_ at the _LOCATION_ envelope and in the nucleoplasm . when the protein was fused to _METHOD_ proteins at its n terminus the subcellular localization was similar to that of the c terminally fused protein except that the nucleocytoplasmic localization was weaker . in the cortical cytoplasm the protein showed a clear localization adjacent to the _LOCATION_ labeled with the coexpressed _LOCATION_ marker _METHOD_ hdel . interestingly differences in _LOCATION_ structure were observed when _METHOD_ hdel was _PROTEIN_ together with specific _PROTEIN_ mutants in which either the minor _PROTEIN_ domain _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ the major _PROTEIN_ domain _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or both _PROTEIN_ domains _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were mutated . whereas _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ had no effect on the _METHOD_ hdel labeled _LOCATION_ network _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ resulted in an extensively modified _LOCATION_ network . similar results were obtained when we used _METHOD_ hdel as _LOCATION_ marker or when n terminal _METHOD_ protein fusions to wild type or mutant _PROTEIN_ were used . interestingly the dominant effects of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ on _LOCATION_ structure were seen only when the _LOCATION_ marker _METHOD_ hdel was transiently _PROTEIN_ . when we used the _METHOD_ hdel transgenic line this effect was not observed . this suggests a critical role of _PROTEIN_ function in the _PROTEIN_ of the _LOCATION_ network upon sudden _LOCATION_ stress such as caused by strong transient overexpression of the _LOCATION_ marker . if the altered _LOCATION_ phenotype observed in the presence of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was due to transient overaccumulation of misfolded protein in the _LOCATION_ the effect should be alleviated by coexpression of _LOCATION_ chaperones that _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ proteins in the quality control cycle . indeed transient _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ instead of _METHOD_ hdel as _LOCATION_ marker revealed an intact _LOCATION_ network upon coexpression with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . moreover _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ weakened the effect of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ on the _LOCATION_ structure in the presence of the transiently _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ marker _METHOD_ hdel . the accumulation of misfolded proteins in the _LOCATION_ upon transient _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ hdel was confirmed by quantitative reverse transcription pcr experiments which revealed a strong induction of genes encoding the n. benthamiana _LOCATION_ luminal stress marker proteins _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ and crt . compared with transient _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ as control these genes were also induced upon ectopic _PROTEIN_ of the dominant negative _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein . importantly the _LOCATION_ stress markers were not induced upon _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ compared with the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ control . as expected the markers were also not significantly induced in transgenic _METHOD_ hdel _PROTEIN_ plants compared with the wild type . we also tested whether _LOCATION_ stress causes induction of _PROTEIN_ in n. benthamiana . transient _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ hdel and arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in n. benthamiana leaves induced _PROTEIN_ of compared with the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ control while transiently _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ did not . was also not significantly induced in plants compared with the wild type . collectively these findings indicate that plant _PROTEIN_ proteins function in alleviating _LOCATION_ stress and _PROTEIN_ a native _LOCATION_ structure in the presence of accumulated misfolded _LOCATION_ proteins . to alleviate _LOCATION_ stress the misfolded proteins are usually removed from the _LOCATION_ via _LOCATION_ . thus _PROTEIN_ could be induced during virus infection to support the retrotranslocation of _LOCATION_ associated misfolded viral proteins to the cytoplasm . as mentioned above tmv _PROTEIN_ accumulates in _LOCATION_ associated proteinaceous inclusions during _PROTEIN_ infection as well as when ectopically _PROTEIN_ . since recombinant _PROTEIN_ interacted with a putative tobacco _PROTEIN_ in vitro we surmised that the _LOCATION_ accumulated _PROTEIN_ may represent a substrate for _PROTEIN_ mediated retrotranslocation . to test a potential role of _PROTEIN_ in relation to _PROTEIN_ in _LOCATION_ inclusions we _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in n. benthamiana leaves carrying infection sites of a tmv derivative _PROTEIN_ a functional _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . interestingly _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ colocalized with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in _LOCATION_ associated inclusions but not with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ localized at pd or along microtubules . colocalization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ to _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ at inclusions was also observed when _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was _PROTEIN_ in the absence of virus infection . to test whether _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ undergo direct protein protein interactions we used _METHOD_ lifetime imaging microscopy to investigate the efficiency of _METHOD_ resonance energy transfer between the _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ moieties of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ proteins ectopically _PROTEIN_ in n. benthamiana and colocalizing in _PROTEIN_ inclusions . compared with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ when _PROTEIN_ alone and localizing to the _LOCATION_ or _LOCATION_ the protein exhibited a reduced _METHOD_ _METHOD_ lifetime when _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and colocalizing with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in the _LOCATION_ inclusions . the observed reduction in _METHOD_ lifetime represents a fret efficiency of which is strongly indicative for molecular protein protein interactions . a comparable reduction in _METHOD_ _METHOD_ lifetime and representing a fret efficiency of was observed when we _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ together with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . thus _PROTEIN_ appears to interact with the _PROTEIN_ of both tmv and ormv although the two proteins share only amino acid similarity . interestingly no significant fret values were obtained when amino acids at positions to or to were deleted from _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ suggesting that the interaction requires the n terminus of _PROTEIN_ . no significant change in _METHOD_ _METHOD_ lifetime and thus no significant fret was observed when _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was coexpressed with _PROTEIN_ carrying the fusion to _METHOD_ at its n terminus rather than at its c terminus indicating that interaction might require a free _PROTEIN_ n terminus . to further confirm the interaction between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ as indicated by flim fret we performed coimmunoprecipitation experiments with protein extracts of n. benthamiana leaf samples in which we _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ alone or together with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . as is shown in figure _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ precipitated with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ using anti _METHOD_ antibodies but did not precipitate with anti _METHOD_ antibodies in the absence of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ did also not precipitate when _PROTEIN_ together with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ but normal rabbit serum was used for immunoprecipitation . however anti _PROTEIN_ antibodies precipitated _PROTEIN_ under these conditions . using _METHOD_ trap we further confirmed that the interaction between _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ is specific and depends on the _PROTEIN_ n terminus and on a free _PROTEIN_ n terminus . fret between transiently _PROTEIN_ proteins was determined by flim . lifetimes are mean values of independent measurements in different cells sd . fret percentage was calculated according to the formula . _METHOD_ lifetime n number of measurements . the interaction between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in _LOCATION_ associated inclusions suggests that _PROTEIN_ may be involved in _LOCATION_ associated degradation of _PROTEIN_ . since the _PROTEIN_ accumulates in _LOCATION_ inclusions during _PROTEIN_ infection stages this process may lead to removal of misfolded accumulated _PROTEIN_ recovery of a native _LOCATION_ structure and reduction of _LOCATION_ stress . to investigate whether interaction of _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ results in degradation of _PROTEIN_ we analyzed the effect of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ on the levels of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in n. benthamiana leaves in the presence of the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide . interestingly whereas _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ levels _PROTEIN_ over time in cells _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ levels did not _PROTEIN_ but rather increased in cells _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . this finding suggests that _PROTEIN_ degradation is dependent on _PROTEIN_ enzyme activity . the increase of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein levels in the presence of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ may result from incomplete inhibition of protein synthesis by the inhibitor . stability of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in the chx treated tissues was verified by western blot . interestingly _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ levels did not _PROTEIN_ upon chx treatment irrespective of whether _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was coexpressed . this observation may indicate that the interaction between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ is a prerequisite for _PROTEIN_ degradation . evidence for the hypothesis that _PROTEIN_ mediated degradation of _PROTEIN_ may indeed reduce _LOCATION_ stress induced by _PROTEIN_ is provided by western blot experiments in which we used a maize crt antibody to analyze endogenous crt levels in n. benthamiana leaves ectopically coexpressing _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ together with tagged or untagged _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ . these experiments revealed higher levels of the _LOCATION_ stress induced chaperone crt in the presence of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ mutant which unlike _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ is unable to interact with _PROTEIN_ . increased amounts of crt observed upon _PROTEIN_ of tagged or untagged _PROTEIN_ deficient _PROTEIN_ compared with functional _PROTEIN_ validate the induction of _LOCATION_ resident chaperones in the presence of the dominant negative _PROTEIN_ protein already seen at the transcript level and confirm that the _METHOD_ fusion to _PROTEIN_ does not interfere with the functionality of the protein . deletion mutations in the n terminus of _PROTEIN_ such as interfere with protein function in virus movement and with the localization of the protein along microtubules and at pd . since the n terminus of the protein is important for interaction with _PROTEIN_ we wondered whether _PROTEIN_ could play a role in directing the _PROTEIN_ away from _LOCATION_ inclusions for association with microtubules and pd . as a test for this hypothesis we analyzed whether overexpression of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ would trigger a redistribution of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ from inclusions to microtubules and pd . because _PROTEIN_ shows extensive association with both inclusions and microtubules it was difficult to visualize and quantify a gradual change in the tendency of accumulation to these alternative localizations using the wild type protein . therefore for this test we used _PROTEIN_ a functional _PROTEIN_ variant that carries a mutation in one of the putative transmembrane domains and accumulates predominantly in _LOCATION_ associated inclusions and less along microtubules and shows a more homogeneous subcellular localization throughout infection sites . _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in tmv _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ infection sites on n. benthamiana leaves indeed resulted in an increased accumulation of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ along microtubules . quantification of this phenomenon revealed that in cells _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ the number of cells with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ associated with microtubules increased to compared with upon _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ . in contrast _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ the number of cells showing microtubule labeling to of the cells . these results suggest the involvement of _PROTEIN_ activity in the relocalization of _PROTEIN_ from _LOCATION_ associated inclusions to microtubules . to further test the role of _PROTEIN_ in directing _PROTEIN_ away from the _LOCATION_ we wondered whether _PROTEIN_ overexpression would influence the cell to cell spread of tmv infection . according to the current model tmv movement occurs in form of _PROTEIN_ containing viral ribonucleoprotein/replication complexes that are transported in association with the _LOCATION_ to the pd for intercellular spread . since _PROTEIN_ is essential for this process we expected that tmv movement should be inhibited if _PROTEIN_ activity removes _PROTEIN_ from the _LOCATION_ upon introduction into cells at the leading front of infection . in order to test the effect of _PROTEIN_ activity on virus movement we _PROTEIN_ free _METHOD_ in one half and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in the other half of n. benthamiana leaves carrying tmv _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ infection sites and measured the size of _METHOD_ infection sites d _PROTEIN_ . the sizes of infection sites in leaf halves _PROTEIN_ wild type _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were approximately reduced compared with infection sites in leaf halves _PROTEIN_ free _METHOD_ . no such difference was observed between infection sites in leaf halves _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ respectively . these observations are consistent with a role of _PROTEIN_ in virus movement by removing _PROTEIN_ from the _LOCATION_ associated transport pathway . moreover since _PROTEIN_ interacts with _PROTEIN_ in _LOCATION_ inclusions _PROTEIN_ mediated removal of accumulated _PROTEIN_ from the _LOCATION_ may primarily occur as part of an _LOCATION_ stress induced response that allows _LOCATION_ recovery during _PROTEIN_ stages of infection .
