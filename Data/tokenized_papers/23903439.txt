_PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is an evolutionarily conserved kd protein that is closely related to ubiquitin and that can be conjugated like ubiquitin to specific lysine residues of target proteins in eukaryotes . in contrast to ubiquitin for which a broad range of substrate proteins are known only a very limited number of _PROTEIN_ target proteins have been identified to date . best understood and also evolutionarily conserved is the _PROTEIN_ modification of cullins core subunits of the cullin _PROTEIN_ type ubiquitin ligases that promote the polyubiquitylation of degradation targets in eukaryotes . here we show that myeloid differentiation _PROTEIN_ related lipid recognition domain protein _PROTEIN_ is an _PROTEIN_ as well as ubiquitin modified protein in arabidopsis and examine the functional role of _PROTEIN_ in the plant cell . our analysis indicates that _PROTEIN_ resides in the _LOCATION_ as well as in _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ bodies . _LOCATION_ bodies are brassicales specific _LOCATION_ derived organelles and similar to other _LOCATION_ body proteins _PROTEIN_ orthologs can only be identified in this order of flowering plants . _PROTEIN_ gene _PROTEIN_ is promoted by wounding as well as by the phytohormone jasmonic acid and repressed by ethylene signals that are known to induce and repress _LOCATION_ body formation respectively . furthermore _PROTEIN_ protein abundance is dependent on _PROTEIN_ a master regulator of _LOCATION_ body formation in arabidopsis . the regulation of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and the localization of _PROTEIN_ in _LOCATION_ bodies and the _LOCATION_ is in agreement with a demonstrated importance of _PROTEIN_ in the defense to herbivore attack . here we extend the spectrum of _PROTEIN_ biological functions by demonstrating a role in the response to microbial pathogens .
we have previously used transgenic lines that _PROTEIN_ hemagglutinin _PROTEIN_ tagged _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ under the control of a dexamethasone inducible gene _PROTEIN_ system to isolate _PROTEIN_ modified proteins from arabidopsis . using the _PROTEIN_ affinity tag we were able to purify a number of proteins as putative _PROTEIN_ conjugates from total protein extracts prepared from an _PROTEIN_ line . however our experimental strategy suffered from the weakness that the choice of the purification tag only allowed purifying _PROTEIN_ conjugates under native conditions so that we may have recovered proteins that are _METHOD_ not _PROTEIN_ modified but interact with such conjugates . therefore we set out to examine a subset of these putative _PROTEIN_ conjugates more critically with _PROTEIN_ to their _PROTEIN_ modification . in this context we also generated myc _PROTEIN_ lines for the _PROTEIN_ of a myc tagged variant of the putative _PROTEIN_ conjugate _PROTEIN_ in the _PROTEIN_ transgenic background . following immunoprecipitation of the myc _PROTEIN_ fusion protein _METHOD_ we could detect the protein with an anti myc antibody in two prominent _METHOD_ of approximately and kd . detection of _PROTEIN_ conjugates with an anti hemagglutinin antibody then revealed the presence of at least two additional _PROTEIN_ conjugated _METHOD_ of myc _PROTEIN_ of approximately kd suggesting that a minor fraction of myc _PROTEIN_ is indeed _PROTEIN_ modified . since our further analysis of the protein sequence revealed that _PROTEIN_ carries an n terminal signal peptide that should be proteolytically cleaved during protein transport we also generated a construct for the _PROTEIN_ of a c terminally tagged _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ ha _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . following immunoprecipitation of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ ha we could again confirm that _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ modified because a fraction of immunoprecipitated _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ ha was also recognized by an antibody directed against the endogenous _PROTEIN_ protein which detected a higher _METHOD_ form of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ ha that could be explained by the conjugation of the kd _PROTEIN_ . we thus concluded that _PROTEIN_ is indeed a _PROTEIN_ modified protein . following immunoprecipitation and _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ we subsequently identified lys as at least one lys residue of immunoprecipitated _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ ha that carried the di gly footprint that is retained on _PROTEIN_ and ubiquitin modified proteins after trypsin digestion . we then mutagenized lys and subsequently all other lys residues of _PROTEIN_ to arg with the goal of obtaining a nonneddylatable _PROTEIN_ variant . however the _PROTEIN_ modification of _PROTEIN_ was detected in each of these _PROTEIN_ mutant variants indicating that _PROTEIN_ may be attached to multiple or to variant lys residues in the wild type or the mutated _PROTEIN_ proteins . the conclusion that _PROTEIN_ may be neddylated at multiple residues is also supported by our observation that frequently more than one neddylated form of _PROTEIN_ was apparent in immunoblots following the immunoprecipitation of _PROTEIN_ and the detection of _PROTEIN_ or endogenous _PROTEIN_ . in summary these data suggest that _PROTEIN_ may be modified by multiple _PROTEIN_ molecules . to be able to detect endogenous _PROTEIN_ protein we raised an anti _PROTEIN_ peptide antibody that readily detected the kd _PROTEIN_ protein in total protein extracts from wild type plants . since we detected _PROTEIN_ conjugated _PROTEIN_ following _PROTEIN_ immunoprecipitation we concluded that also endogenous _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ modified . we then used the neddylation inhibitor to test whether the modification of _PROTEIN_ was dependent on the activity of the _PROTEIN_ conjugation enzyme . indeed _PROTEIN_ neddylation was reduced following a pretreatment of the plants with suggesting that _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ modified by the established _PROTEIN_ conjugation pathway . interestingly when we immunoprecipitated _PROTEIN_ using the tagged _PROTEIN_ fusion variant we noted that anti _PROTEIN_ did not only detect _PROTEIN_ as a neddylated _PROTEIN_ conjugate but also _PROTEIN_ in its apparent unmodified form . similar results were obtained following immunoprecipitations of _PROTEIN_ conjugates from the myc _PROTEIN_ transgenic line . in these immunoprecipitations we detected specifically the kd variant of myc _PROTEIN_ and not the kd higher _METHOD_ form and we took this finding as an indirect indication that the kd variant detected in myc _PROTEIN_ lines represents the neddylatable form of myc _PROTEIN_ . the kd form in turn may represent a posttranslationally modified form that can not be neddylated and that could result from the protein s n terminal signal peptide being blocked by the myc tag . we reasoned that the appearance of unconjugated _PROTEIN_ may be the result of an enzymatic deconjugation of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ during the immunoprecipitation procedure . alternatively _PROTEIN_ may bind to _PROTEIN_ or to _PROTEIN_ conjugates in a noncovalent manner . the latter view was supported by an embl european nucleotide archive database entry for _PROTEIN_ that described the protein as a yeast two hybrid interactor of a ubiquitin pentamer as well as by the _PROTEIN_ that abundant amounts of _PROTEIN_ were precipitated in the immunoprecipitation experiments that in our view could not be explained by the small amounts of _PROTEIN_ modified _PROTEIN_ detected in immunoblots after _PROTEIN_ immunoprecipitations . to test whether _PROTEIN_ can be covalently linked to ubiquitin we carried out immunoprecipitations from transgenic lines that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ a construct analogous to _PROTEIN_ for the inducible _PROTEIN_ of an ha _PROTEIN_ tagged ubiquitin . indeed we could detect _PROTEIN_ also in the form of a high _METHOD_ ubiquitin conjugate of approximately kd in the _PROTEIN_ immunoprecipitates . thus we concluded that _PROTEIN_ is a _PROTEIN_ conjugated as well as a ubiquitin conjugated protein in vivo . while we detected small amounts of the apparently unmodified _PROTEIN_ variant also in several _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ purifications this form of _PROTEIN_ was absent in others . therefore we reasoned that the copurification of the unmodified _PROTEIN_ is the result of a deconjugation of _PROTEIN_ from _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ that occurred during the immunoprecipitation of _PROTEIN_ conjugates . similarly _PROTEIN_ may be deconjugated from _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in the respective immunoprecipitations of _PROTEIN_ . to test whether _PROTEIN_ and ubiquitin can interact with _PROTEIN_ also in a noncovalent manner we tested their interactions using the yeast two hybrid system . indeed this interaction analysis revealed that _PROTEIN_ readily interacts with both ubiquitin family proteins in the yeast system . analysis of the _PROTEIN_ of the fusion proteins in yeast confirmed that all proteins were _PROTEIN_ but interestingly also that the activation domain fusion protein fused to _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was conjugated to a broad range of proteins in the yeast host . no such conjugates could be detected in the case of activation domain ubiquitin possibly reflecting the _PROTEIN_ that such ubiquitin conjugates are directly targeted for proteasomal degradation . _PROTEIN_ is encoded by the arabidopsis gene _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ has two closely related putative paralogs adjacent to the _PROTEIN_ locus on chromosome of the arabidopsis genome namely _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . additionally these three ml domain proteins share sequence homology with a number of proteins from arabidopsis and b. rapa and with other proteins from non brassicaceae species such as the dicots tomato grapevine and soybean and the monocots rice and brachypodium distachyon . although the genomes of both arabidopsis and b. rapa encode three _PROTEIN_ like proteins namely arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and and b. rapa and the three _PROTEIN_ paralogs of each species are more closely related to each other than to the proteins from the respective other species suggesting that they originated from independent duplication events . based on the current annotation of these proteins the vast majority of _PROTEIN_ related proteins from arabidopsis and b. rapa contains an n terminal signal peptide which suggests that these proteins are directed to the _LOCATION_ and from there targeted to the _LOCATION_ or the secretory pathway . the remaining part of these ml proteins has sequence homology with the lipid recognition domain of the mammalian ml domain proteins md and _PROTEIN_ . however the restricted homology within this domain does not allow drawing any conclusions on the binding specificity of any of the arabidopsis proteins . based on their homology to md the members of this protein family were previously classified as ml proteins however none of the plant ml domain proteins have been characterized at the biochemical cell biological or functional level as yet . we also noted with interest that proteins closely related to _PROTEIN_ can only be found in brassicales species including arabidopsis and b. rapa or inversely that these proteins are seemingly absent from the genomes of non brassicales dicots monocots the moss physcomitrella patens and the lycophyte selaginella moellendorffii . in order to understand the biological function of _PROTEIN_ we examined two putative alleles with transfer dna insertions in the _PROTEIN_ open reading frame and untranslated region and . our subsequent analysis of _PROTEIN_ protein abundance in the and mutants showed that _PROTEIN_ protein can not be detected in and . while this work was in progress two additional mutant alleles and were described as part of another study of genes related to the defense to herbivores . while this study had associated semidwarfed growth with and we could not detect such a phenotype in and when grown in continuous light growth conditions . for our further work we considered the exon insertion allele as the prototypical mutant allele . in order to understand the intracellular distribution of _PROTEIN_ we generated transgenic lines that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ as a fusion with the _METHOD_ protein mcherry under the control of a kb _PROTEIN_ promoter fragment _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . our analysis of transgenic lines _PROTEIN_ this protein revealed that the protein accumulates in the _LOCATION_ as well as in rod shaped structures that we identified as _LOCATION_ bodies based on their size and shape . this was also supported by their partial colocalization with the marker which highlights the _LOCATION_ of _LOCATION_ bodies as well as the cellular _LOCATION_ network and by their exclusive presence in the seedling epidermis and the cotyledons . the _LOCATION_ body localization of _PROTEIN_ was also verified in lines _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ from the _PROTEIN_ promoter fragment _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . in turn _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ lines did not allow us to visualize the _LOCATION_ localization of _PROTEIN_ most likely due to the _PROTEIN_ that _METHOD_ and the closely related _METHOD_ are degraded in the _LOCATION_ . to confirm the _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ body localization for the endogenous _PROTEIN_ we purified _LOCATION_ and performed a subcellular fractionation based on previously established protocols . in these analyses we identified endogenous _PROTEIN_ in _LOCATION_ preparations from d old seedlings where _PROTEIN_ cofractionated with the marker _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ . to resolve _LOCATION_ bodies we performed centrifugation of protein extracts at from a transgenic line _PROTEIN_ the _LOCATION_ marker _METHOD_ hdel . interestingly _PROTEIN_ could not be retrieved in the fraction that contains the _LOCATION_ bodies suggesting that native _PROTEIN_ may not reside in _LOCATION_ bodies and that the _LOCATION_ body localization of _PROTEIN_ mcherry may be an artifact of the protein fusion . in turn we detected _PROTEIN_ in the soluble fraction in line with its localization to the _LOCATION_ . identical fractionations of the _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ ha however confirmed the proposed _LOCATION_ body localization also for _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ ha . in summary we concluded that _PROTEIN_ is a _LOCATION_ protein that may potentially also reside in _LOCATION_ bodies . the _LOCATION_ localization of _PROTEIN_ observed here is in agreement with the results of a previously published proteomics study that had identified _PROTEIN_ in _LOCATION_ of arabidopsis plants . interestingly _PROTEIN_ was also identified in another proteomics study that aimed at the identification of proteins that are secreted in response to treatments with the plant hormone salicylic acid . since _PROTEIN_ had been shown to be involved in the plant s defense to herbivore attack which induces sa responses we reasoned that _PROTEIN_ may relocalize to the _LOCATION_ space in response to activation of the sa pathway . while we noticed indeed a presence of _PROTEIN_ mcherry after sa treatment our subsequent analyses indicated that this is likely artifactual because it was also found with the unrelated _LOCATION_ lumen marker sp _METHOD_ afvy and because _PROTEIN_ mcherry secretion was the apparent result of ph changes and did not occur in buffered solutions or in the presence of mannitol . to gain further insight into the function of _PROTEIN_ we searched for genes that are coexpressed with _PROTEIN_ . through the analysis of all available microarray data sets deposited in genevestigator we identified a number of coexpressed genes and noticed with interest that eight genes among the first coregulated genes had a demonstrated or proposed function in _LOCATION_ body biology or formation . this set of coregulated genes included _PROTEIN_ a basic helix loop helix transcription _PROTEIN_ essential for _LOCATION_ body formation as well as proposed _PROTEIN_ target genes such as _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . since _PROTEIN_ had also been found to be differentially _PROTEIN_ in a comparison of _PROTEIN_ mutants with the wild type we hypothesized that _PROTEIN_ may regulate _PROTEIN_ gene _PROTEIN_ . this assumption found support in our observation that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was strongly reduced in the _PROTEIN_ mutant _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . since _PROTEIN_ mutants are defective in the formation of _LOCATION_ bodies and since we had identified _PROTEIN_ as a putative _LOCATION_ body protein we questioned whether the apparent absence of _PROTEIN_ protein in the _PROTEIN_ mutant was the consequence of the absence of _PROTEIN_ as its transcriptional regulator or the indirect consequence of the absence of _LOCATION_ bodies in this mutant . to address this question we examined _PROTEIN_ protein abundance also in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants . _PROTEIN_ is a protein of unknown function in _LOCATION_ bodies that is essential for _LOCATION_ body formation but does not have an apparent function related to transcriptional regulation . importantly _PROTEIN_ protein was detectable in _PROTEIN_ but as mentioned above absent in _PROTEIN_ suggesting that the absence of _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ is the result of the absence of the transcriptional regulation by _PROTEIN_ rather than the indirect consequence of the absence of _LOCATION_ bodies . inversely we found no evidence that the absence of _PROTEIN_ in has an influence on the formation of _LOCATION_ bodies . _PROTEIN_ is essential for _LOCATION_ body formation which is promoted by the plant hormone jasmonic acid . it has previously been established that _PROTEIN_ transcription is induced by meja and reduced in response to ethylene . we hypothesized that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ should follow this pattern of transcriptional regulation of _PROTEIN_ if it was a direct _PROTEIN_ transcription target . indeed we found that the abundance of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ as well as the _LOCATION_ body resident _PROTEIN_ gene is induced by meja treatments and suppressed by concomitant treatments with the ethylene precursor aminocyclopropane _PROTEIN_ acid which is converted into the gaseous ethylene hormone when taken up by the plant . this finding thus supported the notion that _PROTEIN_ is a direct _PROTEIN_ transcription target . meja is produced in plants in response to wounding by herbivore pathogens . the knowledge about the regulation of _PROTEIN_ and _LOCATION_ body formation by meja has given rise to the concept that _LOCATION_ bodies may play a role in the response to pathogens . interestingly we found _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mcherry lines to be restricted to the epidermis an observation that could be considered in support of the proposed function in biotic and abiotic interactions with the environment . to assess the possibility of a putative regulation of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ by wounding we generated transgenic lines that _PROTEIN_ the reporter gus under the control of a kb _PROTEIN_ promoter fragment . following the wounding of leaves of transgenic lines _PROTEIN_ this _PROTEIN_ gus construct we observed indeed increased staining at the sites of wounding as well as systemic spreading of the signal over the entire blade of the wounded leaf . since _PROTEIN_ had previously been analyzed in the context of herbivore defense we also _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ gus lines with second instar larvae of the herbivore spodoptera littoralis and found clear evidence for _PROTEIN_ induction at the sites of wounding after insect feeding . in summary these findings support that notion that _PROTEIN_ is a transcription target downstream from _PROTEIN_ that is induced in response to wounding and herbivore attack . _LOCATION_ bodies have been proposed to function in pathogen responses . for this reason we were interested in examining the performance of mutants after _PROTEIN_ with the fungal pathogen alternaria brassicicola and the pathogenic bacterium pseudomonas syringae . a. brassicicola is a necrotrophic fungus that induces cell death upon infection . in comparison with the wild type in which cell lesions were largely restricted to the inoculation spots mutants showed increased susceptibility visible by the increased spreading of necrosis away from the site of infection at d after infection . lesion expansion was associated with an increase of fungal dna in mutants and was partially similar to the responses of the camalexin deficient mutant _PROTEIN_ that has previously been shown to possess enhanced susceptibility to a. brassicicola . in the case of the p. syringae infection experiments we detected reduced pathogen growth d post infiltration in the mutants when compared with the wild type . in quantitative _METHOD_ this reduced growth was comparable to the reduced growth observed in the _PROTEIN_ mutant an established mutant of the p. syringae pathogen response . based on these observations we concluded that _PROTEIN_ has a role in pathogen response in arabidopsis .
