copper an essential redox active cofactor participates in fundamental biological processes but it becomes highly cytotoxic when present in excess . therefore living _METHOD_ have established suitable _METHOD_ to balance cellular and systemic cu levels . an important strategy to _PROTEIN_ cu homeostasis consists of regulating uptake and mobilization via the conserved family of ctr/copt cu transport proteins . in the model plant arabidopsis thaliana _PROTEIN_ protein mediates root cu acquisition whereas _PROTEIN_ protein functions in cu mobilization from intracellular storage organelles . the function of these transporters becomes critical when environmental cu bioavailability diminishes . however little is know about the _METHOD_ that mediate plant cu distribution . in this report we present evidence supporting an important role for _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis cu distribution . similarly to _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ fully complements yeast mutants defective in high affinity cu uptake and localizes to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ of arabidopsis cells . whereas _PROTEIN_ mrna is only up regulated upon severe cu deficiency _PROTEIN_ transcript is _PROTEIN_ under cu excess conditions and displays a more gradual increase in response to _PROTEIN_ in environmental cu levels . consistent with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in aerial vascular tissues and reproductive organs _PROTEIN_ mutant plants exhibit altered cu distribution under cu deficient conditions including increased cu in rosette leaves but reduced cu levels in seeds . this altered cu distribution is fully rescued when the wild type _PROTEIN_ gene is reintroduced into the _PROTEIN_ mutant line . taken together these findings highlight the relevance of _PROTEIN_ in shoot cu redistribution when environmental cu is limited .
as a consequence of a re annotation of the arabidopsis genome we identified a potential cu transport gene that encodes a amino acid protein that we named _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ protein sequence displays multiple features conserved in other _PROTEIN_ type transport proteins including three tmds and the conserved and motifs within and respectively . a recent study has shown that _PROTEIN_ complements the lack of growth in non fermentable _PROTEIN_ sources of the _PROTEIN_ yeast mutant in an dependent manner . to study _PROTEIN_ function in cu transport and utilization further as compared with other members of the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ family of cu transporters we _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ under the control of the constitutive promoter in the _PROTEIN_ yeast strain lacking high affinity cu transport at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ but with no defects in _LOCATION_ cu mobilization . as shown in fig . in addition to complementing the _PROTEIN_ growth defect on media with non fermentable _PROTEIN_ sources _PROTEIN_ also rescues the growth defect of _PROTEIN_ cells under iron deficient conditions achieved by the addition of the specific chelator bathophenanthroline disulfonate _PROTEIN_ . this result suggests that _PROTEIN_ provides cu to both the mitochondrial _PROTEIN_ and the multicu ferroxidase essential for high affinity iron acquisition . compared with other _PROTEIN_ family members _PROTEIN_ complements the _PROTEIN_ growth defect in respiratory and iron deficient conditions similarly to _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ whereas _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ only partially revert _PROTEIN_ growth . taken together these data indicate that _PROTEIN_ is as efficient as the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ transporters in cu delivery to the yeast _PROTEIN_ and fe acquisition _METHOD_ . to ascertain the function of _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis plants we have determined _PROTEIN_ subcellular and tissue specific _PROTEIN_ patterns . consistent with complementation of yeast mutants defective in _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ high affinity cu uptake and with a recent study the subcellular localization of a functional _PROTEIN_ green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ fusion protein in arabidopsis protoplasts overlaps with the lipophilic styryl dye at indicating that _PROTEIN_ is a _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ protein in plant cells . furthermore transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ promoter region fused to the _PROTEIN_ reporter gene indicate that _PROTEIN_ is mostly _PROTEIN_ in shoots including cotyledons and leaves but is absent in primary roots . in adult plants we observe that _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ in the vascular conduits of the stem and leaves meristem trichome and stomata . in pre anthesis flowers _PROTEIN_ is present in pistil and filaments whereas in post anthesis flowers _PROTEIN_ is also detected in pollen . during the development of the siliques _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ in transmitting tissue and in the seed envelope but not in the seed micropyle . finally _PROTEIN_ is also present in embryos . these results are consistent with previous studies indicating that _PROTEIN_ is a _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ protein mostly _PROTEIN_ on the plant aerial part especially in vascular conduits and reproductive organs . the transcription of multiple genes involved in the arabidopsis response to cu deficiency including the iron superoxide dismutase _PROTEIN_ and the cu transporters _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ is activated when the environmental cu concentration _PROTEIN_ . it has been previously shown that _PROTEIN_ mrna is also up regulated in response to cu deficiency however little is known about the range of cu concentrations that mediate _PROTEIN_ activation as compared with other cu responsive genes . to address this question we have determined by quantitative pcr the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mrna levels in day old arabidopsis seedlings grown under cu deficient conditions _METHOD_ cu sufficient conditions _METHOD_ and cu excess _METHOD_ . as shown in fig . _PROTEIN_ mrna levels do not display any alteration between cu excess and cu sufficient conditions whereas _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is significantly increased . upon cu deficiency _PROTEIN_ mrna is strongly up regulated whereas _PROTEIN_ increase by cu deficiency is less severe . these results indicate that _PROTEIN_ displays a less severe and a more gradual induction than _PROTEIN_ as cu availability _PROTEIN_ . to gain insight into the function of _PROTEIN_ in plant cu homeostasis we obtained the arabidopsis t dna insertion line from the gabi kat project _PROTEIN_ . we mapped its t dna insertion site to nucleotides downstream of the _PROTEIN_ translation initiation codon strongly suggesting that this line could allow the isolation of a loss of function mutant . mutants were self pollinated and homozygous plants were identified by pcr with specific oligonucleotides . by semi quantitative pcr using primers that amplify the _PROTEIN_ coding sequence we determined _PROTEIN_ transcript levels in the _PROTEIN_ homozygous line as compared with wild type plants grown under different cu availability conditions . as shown in fig . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ levels in _PROTEIN_ plants remain below the levels of detection whereas a slight increase is observed in wild type plants in response to cu scarcity consistent with its cu dependent regulation . the _PROTEIN_ levels of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ genes were used as controls for cu regulated genes . taken together these results indicate that the _PROTEIN_ homozygous line does not _PROTEIN_ the entire _PROTEIN_ mrna . to characterize further the _PROTEIN_ homozygous line we ascertained the presence of any transcript downstream of the t dna insertion line . for this purpose we used qpcr and two oligos within this region . as shown in fig . analyses by qpcr indicate that _PROTEIN_ plants display at least a fold _PROTEIN_ in mrna _PROTEIN_ at the _PROTEIN_ locus in conditions of cu excess and uncover that wild type plants display a _PROTEIN_ basal _PROTEIN_ even under cu excess . consistent with the lack of _PROTEIN_ promoter regulation residual _PROTEIN_ at the _PROTEIN_ locus is not increased by cu deficiency in _PROTEIN_ mutant plants as occurs in wild type plants . furthermore its altered end which lacks the first nucleotides of the _PROTEIN_ coding sequence suggests that it is probably not translated to any functional protein . these results strongly suggest that _PROTEIN_ is an arabidopsis mutant line that does not _PROTEIN_ a functional _PROTEIN_ protein . to complement the _PROTEIN_ mutant plant a _PROTEIN_ construct containing the _PROTEIN_ coding sequence under the control of its endogenous promoter was integrated into the _PROTEIN_ line . two _PROTEIN_ complemented lines referred to as _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were independently isolated and further analyzed for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . as shown in fig . both complemented lines recover the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ levels of wild type plants grown under cu . furthermore both _PROTEIN_ complemented lines rescue the gradual up regulation of _PROTEIN_ mrna levels observed in wild type plants upon cu deficiency . these results indicate that both _PROTEIN_ complemented lines fully recover the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ defects of the _PROTEIN_ mutant line and are appropriate to address the specificity of any phenotype associated with the lack of _PROTEIN_ . to ascertain the function of the _PROTEIN_ transport protein in arabidopsis plants we grew the _PROTEIN_ mutant line in standard conditions including soil and _METHOD_ medium plates and no significant growth or cu accumulation differences were observed when compared with wild type lines . given that our data suggest that _PROTEIN_ functions in the aerial vascular tissues and its _PROTEIN_ is regulated by cu availability we decided to determine the endogenous cu levels in organs from wild type _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ complemented plants grown under different environmental cu concentrations . for this purpose plants were grown in hydroponic cultures in the presence or absence of cu and the endogenous cu levels were determined by inductively coupled _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ in roots stem leaves and seeds . under cu sufficient conditions we do not observe any significant difference in tissue specific cu accumulation between wild type _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ complemented plants . in all tissues analyzed the levels of endogenous cu _PROTEIN_ when plants are grown under cu deficient conditions as compared with cu sufficiency . furthermore no difference in root and stem cu levels is observed between wild type and _PROTEIN_ plants grown under low cu . importantly we observe that _PROTEIN_ mutants grown under cu deficient conditions display an approximately increase in the endogenous levels of cu in rosette leaves as compared with wild type and _PROTEIN_ complemented plants . moreover seeds from cu deficient _PROTEIN_ plants display an approximately _PROTEIN_ in endogenous cu as compared with wild type and _PROTEIN_ complemented plants . since _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis reproductive tissues and cu accumulation in seeds is altered in _PROTEIN_ knock out mutants we decided to investigate further in more detail the cu distribution in _PROTEIN_ seeds . we used the cu specific _METHOD_ probe coppersensor to determine the distribution of labile cu in seeds of wild type _PROTEIN_ mutants and _PROTEIN_ complemented plants grown in the presence or absence of cu . in both conditions all plant lines display a similar pattern of signal distribution due to cu accumulation in the tissue or _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ space separating the embryo and the aleurone layer of the seed envelope . image quantification of the signal shows that seed cu levels _PROTEIN_ in response to cu deficiency in all cases with a drop observed for the _PROTEIN_ mutant line . these results are consistent with the seed cu accumulation data obtained by icp _METHOD_ which emphasize the difficulty for seeds to acquire cu in the absence of _PROTEIN_ . taken together these data strongly suggest that _PROTEIN_ plays an important role in plant cu distribution between leaves and seeds when cu is limiting . previous results have shown that overexpression of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ cu transporters in arabidopsis leads to an increase in endogenous cu and exacerbated sensitivity to excess cu as found in root length assays . interestingly _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ overexpressing plants display additional phenotypes when grown in soil which include a _PROTEIN_ in the growth rate and hyponastic leaves . to ascertain whether _PROTEIN_ overexpression also leads to these additional phenotypes we generated transgenic plants overexpressing _PROTEIN_ with a hemagglutinin epitope translationally fused to its c terminus _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ plants were grown in soil and compared with wild type plants . as shown in fig . _PROTEIN_ plants exhibit a significant _PROTEIN_ in overall size when compared with the wild type . furthermore _PROTEIN_ plants exhibit curly leaves similar to _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ plants . taken together these and previous results indicate that in addition to higher endogenous cu levels and cu sensitivity overexpression of cu transporters from the _PROTEIN_ family also leads to a general growth defect and hyponastic leaves when grown in soil .
