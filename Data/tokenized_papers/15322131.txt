identification of _LOCATION_ proteomes remains _PROTEIN_ . here we present a simple fast and scalable off line procedure based on three phase partitioning with butanol to fractionate _LOCATION_ proteomes in combination with both in gel and in solution digestions and _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . this should help to further accelerate the field of _LOCATION_ proteomics . using this new strategy we analyzed the salt stripped _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ of chloroplasts of arabidopsis thaliana . proteins were identified at least of which are integral _LOCATION_ proteins . the functions of proteins are unknown these include proteins with tpr _PROTEIN_ rhodanese and dnaj domains . these proteins were combined with all known _LOCATION_ proteins and chloroplast envelope proteins collected from primary literature resulting in non redundant proteins . they were assigned to functional categories using a classification developed for mapman plant j . updated with information from primary literature . the analysis elucidated the likely location of many _LOCATION_ proteins including proteins of unknown function holding the key to better understanding the two _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ . the three phase partitioning procedure added a new level of dynamic resolution to the known _LOCATION_ proteome . an automated strategy was developed to track possible ambiguous identifications to more than one gene model or family member . _METHOD_ _METHOD_ search results ambiguities and functional classifications can be searched via the _LOCATION_ proteome database .
the _PROTEIN_ genome wide analysis of the predicted arabidopsis proteome suggested that the chloroplast proteome contains proteins with one or more tmds when using tmhmm as the predictor . when using the consensus prediction listed in the _PROTEIN_ release of the aramemnon database proteins with tmds were found . these integral _LOCATION_ proteins can be part of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ or inner envelope _LOCATION_ . the number of integral _LOCATION_ proteins in the outer _LOCATION_ is unknown because we can not predict proteins in this _LOCATION_ system . currently fewer than integral _LOCATION_ proteins in the _LOCATION_ and envelope _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ together have been identified despite significant experimental efforts in both _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ . these efforts included substantial fractionation with organic solvents of salt stripped _LOCATION_ and envelope _LOCATION_ followed by esi _METHOD_ as well as one dimensional gels combined with on line nano lc _METHOD_ . in addition many integral _LOCATION_ proteins were initially identified via genetic tools and more traditional protein analyses . to identify additional integral _LOCATION_ proteins or proteins that are tightly bound to the _LOCATION_ via lipid anchors or short helical structures parallel to the _LOCATION_ plane we specifically developed a new fractionation protocol based on a so called three phase partitioning technique using t butyl alcohol originally successfully developed for soluble proteins . these _PROTEIN_ protocols were _PROTEIN_ here to _LOCATION_ proteins using salt stripped _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ as our target proteome . this _PROTEIN_ comprises essentially the switch from t butyl alcohol to butanol addition of solubilization buffer _PROTEIN_ to the upper and lower phases as well as selection of appropriate concentrations and ph shifts . we chose to use butanol because it does not require any addition of to form a two phase system which proved important for the fractionation of _LOCATION_ proteins . the butanol was saturated with _PROTEIN_ solubilization buffer to avoid depleting the _PROTEIN_ from the lower phase during the extraction of pigments and _METHOD_ precipitation of the hydrophobic proteome . it should be pointed out that butanol is only poorly miscible in water but this increases up to when _PROTEIN_ and urea are added . prior to the butanol fractionation the salt stripped _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ were solubilized with urea _PROTEIN_ and reductant to dissociate the lipids and to denature proteins and protein complexes . in addition this liberated the large amount of apolar pigments from their protein carriers in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . stripping of the _LOCATION_ was carried out with m kbr and m _PROTEIN_ combined and we found this very effective . this detergent/lipid/pigment/protein mixture was then mixed with butanol at a ratio leading to partitioning of chlorophylls and carotenoids to the organic upper phase . the pigment enriched upper phase was then removed and replenished with new butanol . four successive extractions were necessary to completely remove the pigments from the lower phase . analysis of these pooled upper phases showed that they contained only very small amounts of proteins from carryover . fig . shows the efficiency of the pigment extraction whereas the butanol phase from the first extraction was dark green that from the last extraction was almost colorless . during the extractions _PROTEIN_ a red precipitate was formed that was highly enriched in carotenoids and devoid of proteins . once the pigments were removed the proteins were stepwise precipitated by changing the concentrations of or changing the ph in the solution . the interphases _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ collected during the fractionation were all white/gray with the exception of _PROTEIN_ which was slightly green . different concentrations and ph steps were tested and the scheme presented in fig . was optimum for the _LOCATION_ proteome . the amounts of proteins that precipitated in each _PROTEIN_ fraction were determined and tested for reproducibility by protein determinations and separation by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . image analysis of four different gel separated extractions stained with the _METHOD_ dye sypro ruby also showed a very good reproducibility . fig . shows the protein profiles _METHOD_ of the total _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ the extracted peripheral population the stripped _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ and the six _PROTEIN_ fractions . _METHOD_ analysis showed that the major bands in the salt extracted fraction corresponded to the three proteins of the water splitting complex of photosystem ii and the and subunits of the _PROTEIN_ complex _PROTEIN_ . these proteins were nearly completely removed from the stripped _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . the major bands in the stripped _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ were the very abundant antenna proteins of _METHOD_ i and ii as well as other _LOCATION_ subunits of _METHOD_ i and ii the cytochrome f complex and the complex of the _PROTEIN_ synthase . the _LOCATION_ were tested for contamination with chloroplast envelopes by western blotting as described previously . as will become clear from the very extensive _METHOD_ analysis the starting material did not contain any of the abundant chloroplast envelope proteins _METHOD_ and only one protein of the envelope protein translocase complex tic toc _PROTEIN_ . no obvious components from mitochondria or other non _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ were identified with the exception of a weak ambiguous identification of two predicted mitochondrial members of the ftsh protease family . thus we concluded that the starting material for _PROTEIN_ fractionation and _METHOD_ analysis was sufficiently pure to obtain meaningful proteome data and to assign the vast majority of the identified proteins to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . we started the _PROTEIN_ fractionation at ph which corresponds to the in vivo ph of the stroma . the hydrophobic proteome _METHOD_ to have a population of proteins very sensitive to _PROTEIN_ since a large portion of proteins precipitated already at mm including a significant amount of the abundant light harvesting chlorophyll binding proteins . a subsequent _PROTEIN_ from ph to was sufficient to selectively precipitate a number of proteins such as a kda protein with unknown function _PROTEIN_ . by then increasing the concentration to mm a broad range of proteins precipitated quite specifically _PROTEIN_ allene oxide synthase a glycine rich protein with unknown function the four _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ members of the ftsh protease family _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and the _LOCATION_ bound nucleoid binding protein _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . some of the very abundant light harvesting chlorophyll binding proteins were still found in this fraction but clearly the majority of them precipitated in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . in the subsequent fraction _PROTEIN_ until saturation light harvesting chlorophyll binding proteins no longer significantly contributed to the population . instead the major bands were small proteins below kda . components of the photosynthetic apparatus _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were the more abundant proteins in this fraction _PROTEIN_ . to be sure that we precipitated all proteins we further changed the ph of the solution to first a very low ph _PROTEIN_ and then to a very high ph _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ was the most abundant protein in the last two fractions in addition to several proteins below kda _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . an extensive _METHOD_ analysis using one dimensional rp lc esi _METHOD_ was carried out after in gel digestion with trypsin . about gel plugs were excised from the gel separated _PROTEIN_ fractions . proteins in the gel plugs were digested with trypsin and the extracted peptides were analyzed by rp lc esi _METHOD_ . the rationale for this extensive sampling was that we also picked gel regions outside the visible protein bands avoiding domination of spectra by peptides derived from the most abundant proteins and enabling us to identify proteins with relatively low _PROTEIN_ levels . indeed proteins were identified of these were chloroplast encoded proteins and the remainder were _LOCATION_ encoded proteins . the minimum criteria for _METHOD_ based identification are detailed under experimental procedures and the probability based mowse score the number of matched peptides and the highest peptide score in mascot are available via _PROTEIN_ for each accession number and for each time the accession number was identified . many of the proteins were identified more than once providing additional significance to the identifications . as will be discussed in more detail care was taken not to over annotate proteins that are members of multigene families . in case the _METHOD_ data could not distinguish between two closely related proteins their identification was marked as ambiguous and these can also be viewed in _PROTEIN_ . the _LOCATION_ encoded proteins were analyzed for the presence of a predicted ctp using targetp . of the identified _LOCATION_ encoded proteins were predicted to have a ctp suggesting that indeed most if not all are chloroplast proteins . after correction of detected incorrect gene models the number of predicted ctp containing proteins increased to . this is very similar to sensitivities of targetp with curated data sets despite reports of much lower sensitivities . to determine the number of proteins with tmds we used the most conservative predictor tmhmm verified the prediction in case the topology had been experimentally determined and corrected the prediction where necessary . after correction of the proteins were predicted to have at least one tmd . a consensus prediction from the aramemnon database suggested nearly tmd containing proteins . all these parameters and predictions can be retrieved via _PROTEIN_ . in solution enzyme digestion of hydrophobic proteins has proven to be very difficult for various reasons . however if successful it provides several major advantages over in gel digestions . particularly it avoids time consuming gel separation steps . in addition sensitivity is expected to increase since gel extraction of digested proteins leads to losses avoided by in solution digests . therefore we made an effort to develop a protocol that can digest the _PROTEIN_ fractions with trypsin in solution . using a combination of a protocol for _PROTEIN_ removal by acetone precipitation and in solution trypsin digestion in we were able to obtain very efficient and reproducible digestions while being fully compatible with nano rp hplc and esi _METHOD_ . efficiency of digestion was verified by maldi time of flight _METHOD_ measurements in linear mode . compared with the very extensive analysis of gel separated proteins discussed above no additional proteins were identified by the limited _METHOD_ analysis of the in solution trypsin digestion . however the in solution digestion typically resulted in higher sequence coverage for abundant hydrophobic proteins with many tmds _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . the tair database reports more than one gene model for of genes of the annotated a. thaliana genome . each gene model might be biologically relevant . to detect discrepancies between the apparent _METHOD_ from the one dimensional electrophoresis gels and the _METHOD_ calculated from the gene models we verified for large discrepancies between experimental molecular _METHOD_ from the one dimensional gels and predicted _METHOD_ of all identified proteins . after careful analyses using the _METHOD_ data as well as the _PROTEIN_ information from _PROTEIN_ sequence tags in arabidopsis and other plant species we determined four interesting discrepancies including gene fusions. contains two gene models in the tair database with predicted _METHOD_ of and kda the apparent _METHOD_ found in the gel was kda . by matching our _METHOD_ data to the protein sequence we determined that the identified protein corresponded to gene model . the full length cdna and different ests matched only gene model . . _GENE_ is annotated as a predicted mitochondrial endopeptidase like protein with a predicted _METHOD_ of kda whereas we identified the protein in the kda region on the one dimensional electrophoresis gels . our _METHOD_ data fit only the c terminal part of the protein . searches in est data bases showed a coverage of only this c terminal domain . interestingly est from brassica napus a species closely related to a. thaliana contains the likely n terminus and importantly is predicted to have a ctp by targetp . we suggest that this c terminal domain is in _PROTEIN_ a small _LOCATION_ protein of kda containing two predicted tmds and that this gene should be renamed . the n terminal part of _GENE_ shows some similarity to an endopeptidase but no est or full length cdna has been found for this part of the gene model . _GENE_ has a predicted _METHOD_ of kda but was found on the gels at kda . our _METHOD_ data fit only the n terminal part of the gene model . a full length cdna overlaps completely with the c terminal part of the gene model but not at all with the n terminal half . matching ests do not bridge these c and n terminal parts of the gene model suggesting that _GENE_ covers two _PROTEIN_ proteins . _GENE_ was identified by nine peptides in _METHOD_ fully supporting the gene model . interestingly the corresponding full length cdnas do not support this gene model possibly suggesting alternative splicing . we found a number of additional proteins with a significant mismatch between experimental protein _METHOD_ and predicted _METHOD_ but we were not able to explain these discrepancies . the identified proteins were cross checked against our earlier study of the salt stripped _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ proteome using acetone/chloroform/methanol extractions as well as against our study on the luminal and peripheral _LOCATION_ proteome using two dimensional electrophoresis gels for protein separation . these three approaches resulted together in identified proteins with proteins identified exclusively after _PROTEIN_ fractionation . proteins were also found in the analysis of the proteome of the salt stripped _LOCATION_ using chloroform/methanol extractions and were identified using both two dimensional electrophoresis gels and solvent extractions . table i lists these _PROTEIN_ proteins predicted ctp and tmds and functional classifications . when excluding two obvious mitochondrial proteins and three outer envelope proteins have predicted ctps . to determine how this partitioning relates to abundance and functional role we used the recent classification in mapman as our starting point . we generously received the classification for arabidopsis genes from the curator of mapman and verified the classification for the proteins . where needed classifications named bins were corrected or refined or if proteins had not yet been assigned we placed them in the appropriate bin based on published literature and prediction of functional domains using pfam hmm as well as on information from _PROTEIN_ and aracyc . these assignments can be found in supplemental tables and and can also be extracted via _PROTEIN_ . together the proteins were assigned to > bins . however to obtain a better overview of the _LOCATION_ function and fractionation the bin assignments were grouped into seven categories . the majority of the shared identifications between _PROTEIN_ and acetone/chloroform/methanol extraction were highly abundant proteins of the photosynthetic apparatus with proteins without any known function . many of the proteins identified in all three analyses were abundant photosynthetic soluble or peripheral proteins in addition to proteins with unknown function and involved in oxidative defense . as expected the overlap between the _PROTEIN_ analysis and the luminal and peripheral proteins was only small because most of the soluble proteins were stripped from the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ before the _PROTEIN_ fractionation . however this overlap consisted of proteins with either unknown function or function related to protein assembly folding and degradation . a small percentage of the proteins identified only by _PROTEIN_ were involved in photosynthesis whereas a large percentage had no known function as well as protein fate and various other functions . whereas our previous studies extracted most of the abundant photosynthetic machinery the _PROTEIN_ fractionation revealed a new class of proteins of much lower abundance thus significantly improving the dynamic resolution of the _LOCATION_ proteome analysis . of the newly identified proteins have one or more predicted tmds and have predicted ctps . we highlight below the function of some of the identified proteins . chlorophyll/prenyl lipid _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and geranylgeranyl reductase are all involved in chlorophyll/prenyl lipid biosynthesis . _PROTEIN_ a putative diiron protein required for the synthesis of protochlorophyllide and a candidate subunit of the aerobic cyclase in chlorophyll biosynthesis has been shown to be associated with both inner envelope and _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . _PROTEIN_ a negative regulator of chlorophyll biosynthesis is associated with a total chloroplast _LOCATION_ fraction . western blotting showed that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ associate exclusively with _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ although _PROTEIN_ in particular was also identified in experimental proteomics studies on the chloroplast envelope . protein _PROTEIN_ fractionation allowed the identification of proteins involved in protein translocation to or across the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . these include and tata/e and tatb _PROTEIN_ subunits of the twin arginine translocation pathway as well as soluble _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ was earlier identified genetically as a chloroplast mutant and was found peripherally associated with both the _LOCATION_ and inner envelope _LOCATION_ . _PROTEIN_ with a predicted pspa domain is a possible enhancer of the tat translocation pathway . interestingly the arabidopsis _LOCATION_ genome has six genes with predicted pspa domains but only the identified _PROTEIN_ protein has predicted ctps . stress stress related proteins were among the _PROTEIN_ proteins . two proteins were identified these are small chlorophyll binding proteins with two tmds and are believed to be induced during light stress in _LOCATION_ . another stress related _LOCATION_ associated protein fibrillin was identified . fibrillins are believed to be associated with lipids/carotenoids and are typically induced by different stresses . all predicted fibrillins in arabidopsis are also predicted to be localized to chloroplasts . so far we identified nine of them in our experimental studies and three in particular were identified many times suggesting a high abundance . other stress related proteins include the _LOCATION_ bound ascorbate peroxidase peroxiredoxin q and glutathione peroxidase . these redox active components are known chloroplast components involved in different aspects of oxidative stress defense and pathogen response . protease and _LOCATION_ processing peptidase _PROTEIN_ involved in cleavage of luminal transit peptides was identified among the _PROTEIN_ proteins . _PROTEIN_ is one of the three general _LOCATION_ processing peptidases . a small family of _LOCATION_ bound containing metalloproteases _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was well resolved on the gel and enriched in almost a single _PROTEIN_ fraction _PROTEIN_ . they are all believed to have two tmds and each of them was identified > times . we also ambiguously identified two mitochondrial _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ they were identified only once . finally we identified a putative and new chloroplast predicted metalloprotease that belongs to the family and is predicted to have three to six tmds . eight of these metalloproteases are present in arabidopsis and five of them are predicted to have ctps . signaling and jasmonic acid _GENE_ is a protein with a morn _LOCATION_ motif which is present in proteins of neuronal cells and is involved in the junction between two _LOCATION_ . some morn motifs have been found in phosphatidylinositol phosphate kinase involved in signaling . about proteins in arabidopsis have a morn motif and only two are predicted to have a ctp . this protein was recently also identified in an envelope proteome analysis . we identified three proteins involved in the synthesis of jasmonic acid two are closely related paralogs of allene oxide cyclase _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and one is allene oxide synthase . they were all identified multiple times in the _PROTEIN_ fractions often with very high probability based mowse scores suggesting that they are quite abundant . allene oxide synthase is a single copy gene whereas four genes encode allene oxide cyclase . interestingly we identified only two of the four paralogs of allene oxide cyclase one form _PROTEIN_ was identified > times with high probability based mowse scores suggesting the highest abundance of this particular paralog . such details are accessible via _PROTEIN_ . one protein is a homolog of from soybean with very weak homology to tyrosine phosphatase . this soybean gene was part of a quantitative trait locus implied in fasciation . chloroplast predicted _GENE_ convincingly identified a number of times contains a forkhead associated domain which is a modular phosphopeptide recognition motif . only proteins in arabidopsis have a forkhead associated domain and four are predicted to have ctps . dna _METHOD_ has been shown to interact with the _LOCATION_ chromosome organized as so called nucleoids . after a number of conflicting reports the protein was shown to be localized to the _LOCATION_ . _GENE_ has some similarity to _PROTEIN_ a _LOCATION_ component shown to interact with a dna binding protein from agrobacterium . _GENE_ is annotated as a tubulin chain but none of the domain predictors tested suggest such a domain . interestingly in vitro experiments showed that tubulin is detectable on the surface of isolated _LOCATION_ . six proteins with a tubulin domain are predicted to be localized to chloroplasts and can be structural components of the plastoskeleton . moreover at least proteins with a kinesin domain and with a myosin domain are predicted to be _LOCATION_ . rhodanese domain have now identified four proteins in the _LOCATION_ with a rhodanese domain with three identified exclusively by _PROTEIN_ analysis . in particular _GENE_ seemed highly _PROTEIN_ given that we identified this protein many times . of predicted rhodanese domain proteins in arabidopsis have a predicted ctp but the function of this domain is not well understood . dnaj central domain proteins have a dnaj like domain suggesting that they might have chaperone like functions . in particular _GENE_ was identified many times _PROTEIN_ . interestingly several have a predicted tmd . proteins with a tpr or _PROTEIN_ of newly identified proteins have a tpr or _PROTEIN_ motif . the _PROTEIN_ proteins compose a very large protein family in mitochondria and chloroplasts often involved in rna related processes . the tpr family in arabidopsis is even larger and is emerging as a family of important protein assembly _PROTEIN_ and/or co chaperones . envelope identified two inner envelope proteins _PROTEIN_ and two outer _LOCATION_ proteins . _PROTEIN_ has been studied quite intensively it has one tmd and a large hydrophilic loop on the stromal side and an arabidopsis disruption mutant was recently identified . ceqorh was shown to be located at the inner envelope _LOCATION_ . this protein is unusual in that it does not have a cleavable ctp and neither the n nor c terminus _METHOD_ to be required for chloroplast targeting . the functions of ceqorh and are unknown . these four proteins likely represent an envelope contamination in contrast to _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ which are known to associate with both _LOCATION_ and envelope _LOCATION_ . as we penetrate deeper into the _LOCATION_ proteome there is potentially an increasing risk of identifying proteins that in _PROTEIN_ come from other subcellular non chloroplast locations . over the last few years several proteome studies have been published on non chloroplast compartments in a. thaliana leaves and cell cultures . we collected these data sets two studies on _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ one study on the total _LOCATION_ the tonoplast the _LOCATION_ the _LOCATION_ the cell wall and the hydrophobic mitochondrial _LOCATION_ and a dozen other mitochondrial proteome analyses all of which are stored in a mitochondrial proteome data base . where necessary we converted gi accession numbers into _PROTEIN_ accession numbers . we then cross correlated the _PROTEIN_ proteins with these data sets . in total _PROTEIN_ proteins were identified in these non chloroplast proteome analyses however nine are confirmed and abundant _LOCATION_ or chloroplast proteins . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ are likely mitochondrial based on their subcellular localization prediction and were already classified in fig . as non chloroplast components . one protein is likely an _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ protein . finally the location and function of four others are unknown but three of them were identified in chloroplast proteome analysis by other laboratories . we can thus conclude that the proteins identified in this _PROTEIN_ analysis likely contain very few proteins from non chloroplast compartments .
plant growth and _LOCATION_ . thaliana was grown on soil with h h dark periods at . _LOCATION_ were purified from fully developed leaves using a combination of differential and gradient centrifugation steps as described . removal of water soluble and peripheral _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ were resuspended at mg/ml chlorophyll in ice cold mm hepes containing a mixture of protease inhibitors as detailed previously . the suspension was diluted times with ice cold solutions of m kbr and _PROTEIN_ to reach a final concentration of m each . the suspension was stirred slowly for min on ice with s sonication steps every min . _LOCATION_ were collected by centrifugation at g for min at washed with mm tris hcl to remove the remaining salts and resuspended in solubilization buffer _PROTEIN_ mm tbp and m urea . the solubilized _LOCATION_ were used as starting material for the _PROTEIN_ fractionation . salt extracted proteins in the supernatant were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid left on ice for min and collected by centrifugation . the pellet was washed with mm tris hcl and resuspended in solubilization buffer . one dimensional electrophoretic from the different samples were heated at for min and spun for min at g prior to separation by one dimensional _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . proteins were separated on cm tricine/sds/urea polyacrylamide gels . the gels were fixed and proteins were visualized by high sensitivity silver staining _METHOD_ brilliant blue r or sypro ruby . images of the gels were taken with an amersham biosciences personal ii or fluors . extraction of pigments and fractionation of hydrophobic _LOCATION_ using _PROTEIN_ treated _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ were resuspended in solubilization buffer . chlorophylls and carotenoids were removed prior to fractionation by sequential extractions with butanol saturated with solubilization buffer with the objective to avoid interference with protein separation or _METHOD_ butanol was added to the solubilized _LOCATION_ proteins at a ratio to facilitate two phase separation between a butanol enriched upper phase and the aqueous lower phase . since pigments preferentially partition to this upper phase they could easily be removed by collecting the pigment enriched upper phase . the upper phase was then replaced with a fresh upper phase . five extractions were necessary to remove the pigments from the lower phase . once the pigments were removed fractionation of the hydrophobic _LOCATION_ proteins was achieved either by stepwise increasing the concentration or by stepwise shifting the ph . after each step an interphase consisting of precipitated proteins was collected between the upper and lower phases and resuspended in solubilization buffer by sonication . six fractions were collected using six different steps _PROTEIN_ addition of mm _PROTEIN_ a shift from ph to with mes _PROTEIN_ addition of to mm _PROTEIN_ saturation of the solution with _PROTEIN_ shift to very low ph by addition of phosphoric acid and _PROTEIN_ shift to very high ph by addition of sodium hydroxide . no proteins were detected in the collected upper phases . protein digestion _METHOD_ analysis and extraction of _METHOD_ than protein spots were excised manually from the one dimensional gels . the spots were automatically washed digested with modified trypsin and extracted using the progest robot as summarized previously . for in solution digestion aliquots from the dissolved _PROTEIN_ fractions were precipitated and _PROTEIN_ was removed as principally described . proteins were precipitated with acetone for min at . precipitates were collected by centrifugation at g for min at . the supernatant was removed and a solution of acetone methanol and acetic acid was added . the samples were incubated for min at followed by centrifugation at g for min at . the residual acetone was removed by vacuum centrifugation . because it has been reported that trypsin is active in we solubilized the proteins in for min followed by dilution with digestion buffer trypsin/protein ratio . the proteins were digested overnight at . the was then removed by vacuum centrifugation of the peptide mixtures . all samples were analyzed using nano lc esi _METHOD_ in automated mode on a quadrupole/orthogonal acceleration time of flight tandem _METHOD_ spectrometer _METHOD_ . details for on line rp hplc were described previously . the spectra were used to search the public data bases automated via in house mascot _PROTEIN_ . when searching mascot the maximum peptide and fragment _LOCATION_ were and da respectively . the probability based mowse score the number of matching peptides and the highest peptide score were extracted from the mascot peptide summary report pages using in house written software . the minimum criteria for identification were as follows one matching peptide with a peptide score higher than the minimum significant individual ion score two matching peptides with a peptide score > or three matching peptides with a peptide score . since > of arabidopsis proteins are part of multigene families protein identifications were verified for ambiguities resulting from the presence of multigene families or conserved domains . this was largely automated via software written inhouse . proteins that were not identified with any unique peptides were manually verified and peptides were ignored if a better fit to the _METHOD_ spectrum could be found in a higher ranking entry . the highest peptide score the probability based mowse score from the peptide summary report and the number of matching peptides as well as remaining ambiguities can be directly seen in _PROTEIN_ when searching an accession number . all identifications based on one matching peptide or low mascot scores were manually verified and all proteins that were identified only once were carefully considered . the _LOCATION_ proteome construction of _PROTEIN_ was described previously . _PROTEIN_ contains the theoretical analysis of all arabidopsis entries _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . predicted tmds from the aramemnon database are from release . compared with the earlier _PROTEIN_ release the mascot scores the number of matching peptides and the higher peptide score for each identification as well as functional classification are listed . ambiguous identifications of members of multigene families can be directly viewed in _PROTEIN_ . concentrations were determined spectrometrically in acetone and protein determination was done using bca .
