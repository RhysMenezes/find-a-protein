arabidopsis salt tolerance/b box zinc finger _PROTEIN_ is a negative regulator of the light signal transduction that localizes to the _LOCATION_ of plant cells and interacts with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in the yeast two hybrid system . the protein contains two b box zinc finger motives at the n terminus and a conserved motif at the c terminal part required for the interaction with _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ accumulates during deetiolation of young seedlings in the first hours of exposure to light . however this accumulation is transient and _PROTEIN_ after prolonged light irradiation . here we identified the amino acidic residues necessary for the _LOCATION_ import of the protein . in addition we created mutated _METHOD_ of the protein and analyzed them by overexpression in the _PROTEIN_ mutant background . our results indicate that the degradation of _PROTEIN_ occurs or at least is initiated in the _LOCATION_ and this _LOCATION_ localization is a prerequisite to fulfill its function in light signaling . moreover mutations in the region responsible for the interaction with _PROTEIN_ revealed that a physical interaction of the proteins is also required for degradation of _PROTEIN_ in the light and for normal photomorphogenesis .
_PROTEIN_ localizes in the _LOCATION_ . to determine its nls constructs carrying the full length coding region of _PROTEIN_ or different deletions of the cdna were fused in frame to the _METHOD_ cdna under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus promoter . to avoid _LOCATION_ accumulation of small mr proteins by diffusion through the _LOCATION_ pores the cdna coding for gus was placed between the _METHOD_ and the _PROTEIN_ deletions . these deletion constructs were used to transfect arabidopsis protoplasts and the subcellular localization of the transiently _PROTEIN_ proteins was analyzed by confocal laser scanning microscopy _PROTEIN_ . as previously reported the _METHOD_ gus _PROTEIN_ protein fusion was detected exclusively in the _LOCATION_ whereas the _METHOD_ gus fusion used as control was detected entirely in the _LOCATION_ . analysis of the amino acid sequence of _PROTEIN_ revealed a putative nls comprising the amino acids to in the c terminal part of the protein . according to this analysis a fragment containing the last amino acids of the protein _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and another fragment containing only the last amino acids _PROTEIN_ and therefore excluding the kkpr motif were fused to the _METHOD_ gus chimeric protein . the amino acid fragment was sufficient to direct the fusion protein into the _LOCATION_ whereas in the absence of the kkpr motif the fusion protein localized exclusively in the _LOCATION_ . further detailed analysis of the nls motif was performed by introducing a point mutation into the full length _PROTEIN_ cdna . the exchange of lys to asn _PROTEIN_ was sufficient to prevent _LOCATION_ import of the fusion protein . accumulation of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ occurs during deetiolation in the first hours of exposure to white light but this accumulation stops after prolonged light exposure . transgenic lines carrying n terminal or c terminal _METHOD_ fusions showed the same dynamics of protein accumulation during deetiolation treatments varying only in the intensity of the _METHOD_ signal in different overexpressing lines . in addition both types of transgenic lines display similar photomorphogenic phenotypes under monochromatic light . to investigate the biological relevance of the _LOCATION_ localization of _PROTEIN_ we generated transgenic homozygous _PROTEIN_ lines constitutively _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ or _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . the subcellular localization of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in d old etiolated seedlings was analyzed immediately after the period of growth in darkness or after transfer to continuous white light . white light treatment of the overexpressor _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ or the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ lines led to the accumulation of the fusion protein in the _LOCATION_ . however in the line overexpressing the mutated version of the protein _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ but not _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ already appeared in the dark grown seedlings . moreover after prolonged light exposure even at time points where the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ signal diminished the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plants still displayed a clear _METHOD_ signal . western blot analysis on protein extracts of the d old transgenic seedlings revealed an approximately kd _METHOD_ band that corresponds to the _PROTEIN_ fusion protein . the _PROTEIN_ pattern resembled the microscopy observations except for the weaker band present in the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ dark samples . this band correlates to the lower amount of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ transcripts in the dark . these results indicate that degradation of _PROTEIN_ in the dark and after prolonged light exposure mostly takes place or at least initiates in the _LOCATION_ . _PROTEIN_ is a negative regulator of red far red and blue light mediated inhibition of hypocotyl elongation . to investigate whether the _LOCATION_ localization of the protein is a prerequisite for its function we carried out light fluence rate response experiments with the above described transgenic lines . seeds were germinated on filter paper and grown for d at under continuous red far red or blue light . as previously reported _PROTEIN_ exhibits under monochromatic light fluences a pronounced inhibition of hypocotyl growth compared to the wild type . independent _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ transgenic lines displayed a similar reduction of hypocotyl elongation as did _PROTEIN_ whereas dark grown seedlings exhibited similar hypocotyl length as the wild type . this indicates that the mutant phenotype is not rescued by the overexpression of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . as positive control a line overexpressing the wild type _PROTEIN_ fused to the _METHOD_ in the mutant background _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was used throughout the experiment . the amount of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was reduced in the _PROTEIN_ background relative to the corresponding overexpressing line . nevertheless the _PROTEIN_ level was sufficient to rescue the _PROTEIN_ mutation indicating that ectopic _PROTEIN_ of the wild type protein complements _PROTEIN_ function . these results provide evidence that overexpression of _PROTEIN_ in the _LOCATION_ does not rescue the _PROTEIN_ phenotype and therefore argue that the localization of _PROTEIN_ in the _LOCATION_ is essential to fulfill its function in the light dependent hypocotyl elongation . as already mentioned _PROTEIN_ confers tolerance to yeast cells growing on lithium chloride media . to verify into which extent the introduced point mutation might affect the function of the protein we _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ or a new protein fusion containing _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ with an additional nls _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in yeast . yeast cells _PROTEIN_ either the negative control or _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ did not grow on media containing mm licl but _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ conferred similar tolerance to high licl concentrations as the wild type protein . in addition we also found that _PROTEIN_ hosts intrinsic transcription activity when used in the yeast two hybrid system . we also used this property to test the function of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and found no difference in the growth capacity on selection media between cells _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and those _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in the _LOCATION_ . in both cases the fusion to the dna binding domain provided in the bait vector of the yeast two hybrid allowed the growth of the cells on medium containing amino triazole demonstrating that the introduced point mutation does not affect the autoactivation activity of the protein . these findings indicate that also in yeast the function of _PROTEIN_ is strongly linked to its _LOCATION_ localization . cys rich b box zn finger domains mediate protein protein and protein dna interactions . _PROTEIN_ contains two tandem repeat b box zn fingers at the n terminal part of the protein . transient _PROTEIN_ assays in arabidopsis protoplasts revealed that the _METHOD_ fusion protein containing the n terminus of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ with the two b box zn fingers is present in the _LOCATION_ and the _LOCATION_ . to unravel possible roles for these domains we produced homozygous transgenic _PROTEIN_ lines containing _METHOD_ n _PROTEIN_ under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus promoter . out of independent monogenic lines two showing the highest _METHOD_ signal were selected for further experiments . in d old etiolated seedlings _METHOD_ n _PROTEIN_ was present in the _LOCATION_ and in the _LOCATION_ of cells . furthermore the _METHOD_ signal remained in the cells after prolonged light treatment indicating that the c terminal part of _PROTEIN_ is required for the rapid turnover of the protein . we analyzed the level of _PROTEIN_ of the chimeric protein by western blot using polyclonal antibodies raised against _METHOD_ . seedlings of wild type _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ n _PROTEIN_ were grown in darkness and transferred to cwl for or h. the results showed an approximately kd _METHOD_ band after h induction in the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ sample but no band could be detected in the _METHOD_ n _PROTEIN_ lines . we performed quantitative reverse transcription pcr analysis to estimate the amount of transcripts of the transgene and to compare it to the endogenous amount of transcripts in the wild type . the level of _METHOD_ n _PROTEIN_ transcripts was evidently much lower than the amount of _PROTEIN_ . in addition we carried out light fluence rate response experiments to investigate whether the small fraction of the fusion protein that accumulated in the _LOCATION_ was sufficient to complement _PROTEIN_ function . however the results showed that the _PROTEIN_ phenotype in those lines was not rescued . as mentioned before a physical interaction occurs in the yeast two hybrid system assay via the repeat of _PROTEIN_ and identified conserved amino acid residues present in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . to analyze whether the interaction with _PROTEIN_ affects _PROTEIN_ function we introduced two point mutations that exchange the residues and of _PROTEIN_ into the _PROTEIN_ cdna _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . the introduced amino acidic changes already described by citation prevent the interaction of both proteins in the yeast two hybrid system but do not change the subcellular localization pattern in protoplasts . to confirm that in _PROTEIN_ those mutations hamper the interaction with _PROTEIN_ in plant cells we coexpressed _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis protoplasts . in addition we also tested the localization of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ n _PROTEIN_ together with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ accumulates strongly in both the _LOCATION_ and the _LOCATION_ forming aggregates of different sizes in both cellular compartments . as previously reported single transfection of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ led to a diffuse distribution of the protein in the _LOCATION_ whereas coexpression of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ resulted in colocalization of both fusion proteins in the same _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ aggregates . the mutation introduced in the nls led to the localization of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ exclusively in the _LOCATION_ in a diffuse manner . however coexpression of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ resulted in the colocalization of both proteins to the same _LOCATION_ aggregations . coexpression of _METHOD_ n _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ did not display any colocalization signal and _METHOD_ n _PROTEIN_ still distributed diffusely in both cell compartments . in the case of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ single transfection or cotransfection with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ invariably resulted in a diffuse distribution of the _METHOD_ in the _LOCATION_ demonstrating that the described point mutations introduced into _PROTEIN_ were sufficient to prevent _PROTEIN_ colocalization also in plant cells . to investigate in planta the effect of the _PROTEIN_ mutation we generated transgenic lines overexpressing _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in the _PROTEIN_ mutant and analyzed the subcellular localization in d old seedlings . in etiolated seedlings and in seedlings treated for h with cwl _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ displayed similar behavior as the wild type protein fusion _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . thus we did not observe any _METHOD_ _METHOD_ in the dark whereas after few hours of light treatment _METHOD_ _LOCATION_ appeared in the cells . however after h of continuous light exposure only the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ lines showed a _METHOD_ signal . western blot analysis confirmed these results indicating that mutations affecting the interaction with _PROTEIN_ stabilize the protein in prolonged light exposure . to investigate the nature of the degradation process that takes place in the dark etiolated seedlings overexpressing _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ were treated with the proteasomal inhibitor and analyzed after h by _METHOD_ microscopy . whereas the control seedlings did not display any _METHOD_ signal seedlings treated with the inhibitor exhibited several _METHOD_ _LOCATION_ in hypocotyls demonstrating that the degradation of the protein in the dark depends on the proteasome . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ accumulates in the _PROTEIN_ mutant in the dark and this result suggested a _PROTEIN_ dependent degradation of the protein in darkness . however our results indicated that degradation of _PROTEIN_ occurs even if the direct interaction with _PROTEIN_ is hampered . we therefore investigated the stability of the mutant protein fusion _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in the _PROTEIN_ background . crosses between _PROTEIN_ and one of the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ transgenic lines were produced and the generation was analyzed after growing the seedlings for d in the dark . approximately of the siblings exhibited a _PROTEIN_ phenotype in the dark . the analysis of the etiolated _PROTEIN_ progeny revealed that around of this population exhibited _METHOD_ signal in the _LOCATION_ of root cells . however due to the strong _METHOD_ displayed by these seedlings we were unable to detect clear _METHOD_ signal in other tissues . in the rest of the progeny the _METHOD_ signal could not be detected suggesting that the degradation of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ dependent . to test whether the interaction with _PROTEIN_ is relevant for the function of _PROTEIN_ we carried out light fluence rate response experiments using the above mentioned transgenic lines overexpressing _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . we could not observe differences between the hypocotyls length of the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ transgenic lines and the _PROTEIN_ mutant whereas the positive control could rescue the _PROTEIN_ phenotype . this indicates that the overexpression of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ does not complement _PROTEIN_ function . these results support the idea that the interaction with _PROTEIN_ is necessary for the correct function of _PROTEIN_ . to verify that the observed result is not due to an effect of the introduced mutations causing for example misfolding of the protein we performed yeast assays as described above . we found that the introduced point mutations did not affect either the salt tolerance capacity nor the autoactivation activity of the protein in yeast .
