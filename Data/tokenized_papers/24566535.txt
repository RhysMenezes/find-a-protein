autophagy is a degradation pathway that recycles cell materials upon encountering stress conditions or during specific developmental processes . to better understand the physiological roles of autophagy proper monitoring methods are very important . in mammals and yeast monitoring of autophagy is often performed with a green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion protein or with acidotropic dyes such as monodansylcadaverine and lysotracker red . to evaluate these monitoring methods here we examined these _METHOD_ by inducing autophagy in arabidopsis thaliana roots as a model for monitoring autophagy in planta . under _PROTEIN_ and nitrogen starved conditions the number and size of vesicles labeled by _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was increased for several hours and then gradually _PROTEIN_ to a level higher than that observed before the start of the experiment . we also observed the disappearance of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ labeled vesicles after treatment with wortmannin a phosphatidylinositol kinase inhibitor known as an autophagy inhibitor showing that the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ transgenic line constitutes an excellent method for monitoring autophagy . these data were compared with plants stained with mdc and ltr . there was no appreciable mdc/ltr staining of small organelles in the root under the induction of autophagy . some vesicles were eventually observed in the root tip only but co localization experiments as well as experiments with autophagy deficient atg mutants provided the evidence that these structures were located in the _LOCATION_ and were not manifestly autophagosomes and/or autolysosomes . extreme caution should therefore be used when monitoring autophagy with the aid of mdc/ltr . additionally our observations strongly suggest that autophagosomes fuse directly to _LOCATION_ in arabidopsis roots .
in yeast and animals _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ has been used as the most reliable molecular marker for autophagosomes . therefore first of all we used _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ transgenic arabidopsis thaliana to monitor autophagic activity in planta . in order to test different methods for observation of autophagy an autophagy induction method has to be employed . since there were already reports of the importance of autophagy during nitrogen starvation as well as _PROTEIN_ starvation we chose to combine the two starvation conditions for a better autophagic response . under nitrogen starvation in combination with _PROTEIN_ starvation conditions the induction of autophagy was observed in a wild type _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ a. thaliana line as well as a _PROTEIN_ rna interference line _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . under nutrient rich conditions several small dot structures with a diameter < labeled by _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ were visible in the roots . then after transfer to starved media the number and size of the dot structures started to increase immediately and increased steadily over several hours . after about h of starvation incubation the _PROTEIN_ shaped structures were more abundant and larger in size . the number of dot structures peaked about h after the beginning of starvation and _PROTEIN_ thereafter but still to a level higher than the original number of the structures . the small dot structures observed are probably _PROTEIN_ which will then become _PROTEIN_ shaped autophagosomes under autophagy inducing conditions . we tracked the percentage of _PROTEIN_ relative to the percentage of autophagosomes present . over the passage of h the percentage of autophagosomes rapidly increases while the percentage of _PROTEIN_ which are predominant in the beginning steadily _PROTEIN_ . autophagosomes are most abundant at h after the beginning of starvation representing of the total population of the structures and then their percentage _PROTEIN_ again . after h _PROTEIN_ and autophagosomes are present equally in the cell . parallel with the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ line we observed a _PROTEIN_ rnai line since there was a study showing that knockdown of _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis resulted in constitutive autophagy . as observed in that report even under nutrient rich conditions the basal level of the number of the dot structures labeled by _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was much higher in the _PROTEIN_ rnai line than in the wild type line . interestingly the number was further increased by the starvation treatment and gradually _PROTEIN_ with kinetics similar to those of the wild type line . the increase in the number of dot structures observed suggests that autophagy is more induced in the _PROTEIN_ rnai line but there is still a possibility that in this line the fusion of autophagosomes with the _LOCATION_ might be inhibited leading to an accumulation of autophagosomes in the cytoplasm . in order to exclude this possibility a concanamycin a treatment experiment was performed . when plant cells are treated with the v _PROTEIN_ inhibitor concanamycin a autophagic bodies can be detected inside the _LOCATION_ lumen as small randomly moving vesicles thus allowing us to monitor autophagic flow . after treatment with concanamycin a for h wild type roots slowly started to accumulate autophagic bodies in the _LOCATION_ lumen and in the _PROTEIN_ rnai line autophagic bodies were already highly accumulated even at this early time point . these results indicate that autophagy is already activated in the _PROTEIN_ rnai line under nutrient rich conditions and that it is further induced by nutrient starved conditions . to confirm the autophagic nature of the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ structures further an autophagy inhibition experiment using wortmannin was conducted . wortmannin has been widely used as an autophagy inhibitor based on its inhibitory effect on class iii _PROTEIN_ activity which is known to be essential for induction of autophagy . after transfer to _PROTEIN_ and nitrogen starved media the number of autophagosomes was increased . however when the plants were simultaneously treated with wortmannin the root cells only presented extremely few very small structures like _PROTEIN_ . after wash out of wortmannin an increased number of dot or _PROTEIN_ shaped structures was again detected . parallel to this and in the same experimental conditions concanamycin a treatments induced accumulation of autophagic bodies in the _LOCATION_ while simultaneous addition of wortmannin inhibited the accumulation of autophagic bodies proving that the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ dots are actually autophagy related and permitting the use of this line in order to monitor autophagy in planta . there is a report showing co localization of mdc stained vesicles and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ autophagosomes in arabidopsis . however it was observed only in protoplasts of suspension cultured cells and thus it was not known if this is the case in planta . therefore we performed mdc staining using arabidopsis roots to check if mdc labels autophagosomes in planta . here mdc was used as a possible means to monitor autophagy in conjunction with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ lines . to observe mdc staining in a. thaliana roots an experiment was conducted on the _PROTEIN_ rnai line under the same conditions as described above . over a period of h starvation during which we confirmed that autophagosomes were increased as shown in fig . mdc positive vesicles were not detected above the root elongation zone even in this _PROTEIN_ rnai line which has higher autophagic activity . then co localization experiments with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ were performed in the wild type line because the _PROTEIN_ level of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in the _PROTEIN_ rnai line was too low for comparison . the results showed that there was never an overlap of mdc staining and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in the root . in root tips on the other hand some mdc positive vesicles were occasionally detected . the mdc stained vesicles detected appeared larger than the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ vesicles seen and were moving _LOCATION_ in the _LOCATION_ . these vesicles are therefore not autophagosomes which should be located in the cytoplasm . we also occasionally detected the same type of rapidly moving mdc stained vesicles in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ root tips . co localization experiments with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in the root tips showed no overlap of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and mdc _METHOD_ further confirming that mdc stained structures are not autophagosomes . altogether these results indicate that mdc does not stain autophagosomes in planta . lysotracker has been also reported as an indicator of autophagosomes or autolysosomes especially in animals and recently also in plants therefore we checked in _PROTEIN_ rnai roots if ltr specifically labels autophagosomes/autolysosomes in planta . in order to check autophagy related staining by ltr the same autophagy inducing nitrogen and _PROTEIN_ starvation conditions were used . as observed in fig . autophagosomes were greatly increased after approximately h incubation on the nutrient starved media . however as with mdc no ltr positive vesicles were detected in the roots even under such autophagy inducing conditions while in the root tips some ltr signals were clearly identified . as with mdc the ltr positive structures observed were moving _LOCATION_ in the _LOCATION_ . in addition these structures appeared to be larger than the vesicles labeled by _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and they actually did not co localize with them . therefore the ltr positive structures in root tips are not autophagosomes and/or autolysosomes . this was confirmed by the presence of the ltr positive structures in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants . these results suggest that ltr could also label some structures other than autophagy related structures especially in the _LOCATION_ lumen . to verify further the specificity of ltr staining of autophagosomes and/or autolysosomes we observed senescence associated _LOCATION_ in a. thaliana senescent leaves with the aid of ltr . previously otegui et al . found that during senescence a population of small lytic _LOCATION_ develops in the peripheral cytoplasm of leaf cells and that these savs can be detected by ltr . although the data were not shown the authors stated that savs seem not to be autophagy related since they are present even in _PROTEIN_ mutant leaves . as observed in their study we detected some savs in the peripheral cytoplasm of wild type senescent leaf cells . however ltr stained vesicles were detected more in senescent leaf cells of the _PROTEIN_ mutant than in those of the wild type plant sometimes forming large aggregates . most of the ltr positive signals in _PROTEIN_ leaf cells seem to be located in the _LOCATION_ lumen not in the peripheral cytoplasm . from these results we could at least conclude that ltr easily labels some structures that are not autophagy related . in tobacco by cells autophagic processes have been observed with the aid of e a cysteine protease inhibitor coupled with both an autophagy inhibitor such as ma and acidotropic dyes such as ltr or fm . in e treated by cells small acidic compartments which seem to be autolysosomes are clustered and form aggregates around the _LOCATION_ not in the _LOCATION_ lumen . from these observations it has been proposed that autophagosomes acquire hydrolytic enzymes to become autolysosomes before fusion with the central _LOCATION_ and that the autolysosomes play a major role in the degradation process in tobacco suspension cultured cells . in arabidopsis roots concanamycin a treatment which will provoke inhibition of _LOCATION_ degradation results in accumulation of autophagic bodies in the _LOCATION_ lumen suggesting that autophagosomes fuse directly to _LOCATION_ . the difference in the autophagic process between tobacco and arabidopsis suggests that different autophagic pathways exist in different plant species . therefore we observed the situation after e treatment in a. thaliana roots with the aim of confirming the aforementioned results in planta . we first looked at arabidopsis transgenic roots in which _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ can be visualized by monitoring _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ to determine if the aggregates formed after treatment with e are in the _LOCATION_ lumen or in the cytoplasm . after treatment with e for h large aggregates were detected at the center of cells surrounded by _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ not always close to the _LOCATION_ . this differs from the situation in by cells suggesting that these are not aggregates of autolysosomes but more likely to be autophagic bodies . we then performed time lapse imaging of e treated roots at early time points in order to observe the dynamic process of aggregation . in the first h of e treatment there was initially detection of single vesicles in the _LOCATION_ similar to the autophagic bodies detected after concanamycin a treatment then after approximately h of treatment these single vesicles started to form aggregates and eventually fused into even larger aggregates . this aggregation process was not observed in atg mutants suggesting that they are autophagic bodies . time lapse imaging revealed dynamic movement of two small aggregates forming a larger one . the small aggregates shown by black and white arrowheads were moving randomly at the beginning indicating that they were inside the _LOCATION_ and the large aggregate formed became stable . this result is consistent with a previous report showing that in e treated arabidopsis root cells inclusions corresponding to cytoplasm degradation intermediates accumulate in the central _LOCATION_ . in a. thaliana roots therefore e treatment causes the accumulation of autophagic bodies inside the _LOCATION_ .
arabidopsis thaliana ecotype columbia was used in this study . the seeds of t dna knockout mutants of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were obtained from nottingham arabidopsis resource center . the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ rnai and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ lines used in this study were provided by professsor gad galili dr. christian meyer and dr. chieko saito respectively . for generation of the _PROTEIN_ rnai line _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ the coding sequence of _PROTEIN_ lacking a stop codon was first amplified with aaaaagcaggctccaaaatgaataaaggaagcatcttt and _PROTEIN_ primers . the pcr product was cloned in by a _PROTEIN_ reaction . an lr reaction cloned the chimeric gene in _PROTEIN_ containing _METHOD_ of the gene . the construct was introduced into the agrobacterium tumefaciens strain by electroporation and then into the a. thaliana _PROTEIN_ rnai line by agrobacterium mediated transformation using the floral dip method . homozygous transformants selected by antibiotic resistance were used . plants were grown vertically on solid mgrl media supplemented with mm _PROTEIN_ and sucrose _PROTEIN_ at with h h dark cycles for d before observation . for nutrient starvation they were transferred to nitrogen and sucrose depleted mgrl solid media . in c n experiments the plants were kept in the dark to reduce sucrose production by photosynthesis . in order to quantify the number of autophagic structures observed in fig . the structures were counted using several z stack merged images . _PROTEIN_ were defined as structures whose diameter was < while autophagosomes were defined as having a diameter > . this was done in order to separate the two groups clearly and account for image dispersion occurring when using confocal imagery based on the average structure sizes observed . the number of structures was counted per . all data analysis was performed using imagej and excel . for wortmannin treatment week old seedlings grown on _PROTEIN_ media were transferred to _PROTEIN_ or c n liquid media containing wortmannin prepared from mm stock dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide _METHOD_ . for e treatment week old seedlings were incubated in the dark in mes buffer containing e dissolved in _METHOD_ for the period indicated . concanamycin a treatment was done using a concentration as previously described . plants were stained with mdc at final concentration for min and then washed three times with phosphate buffered saline _PROTEIN_ as previously described . ltr staining was done with ltr in mm hepes na as previously described then washed once with _PROTEIN_ and observed . the staining solutions were kept in the dark . confocal microscopy was done on an inverted _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ with a nm argon laser for _METHOD_ observation _PROTEIN_ and a nm laser for ltr observation _PROTEIN_ . the objective used was an hcx pl apo lbd . bl water objective . for _METHOD_ microscopy an upright zeiss axio imager z was used with a dapi filter _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ for mdc observation and a _METHOD_ filter _PROTEIN_ for _METHOD_ observation with a plan apochromat oil dic vis ir zeiss oil objective . for dic imagery a zeiss axio imager was used . all resulting images were processed in image j when necessary .
