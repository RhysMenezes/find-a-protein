the _PROTEIN_ mutant of arabidopsis thaliana exhibits altered patterns of root and organ growth . _PROTEIN_ roots etiolated hypocotyls and leaf petioles exhibit right handed axial twisting and root growth on inclined agar media is strongly right skewed . the touch dependent _PROTEIN_ root skewing phenotype is suppressed by the antimicrotubule drugs propyzamide and oryzalin and right skewing is exacerbated by cold treatment . cloning revealed that _PROTEIN_ is allelic to _PROTEIN_ . however modifiers in the columbia and landsberg _LOCATION_ ecotype backgrounds mask noncomplementation in _PROTEIN_ plants . the _PROTEIN_ gene encodes a plant specific kd protein that is ubiquitously _PROTEIN_ and belongs to a six member gene family in arabidopsis . an _PROTEIN_ green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ fusion _PROTEIN_ in transgenic seedlings localized to microtubules within the cortical array preprophase band phragmoplast and mitotic spindle . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was concentrated at the growing ends of cortical microtubules and was dependent on polymer growth state the microtubule related _METHOD_ dissipated upon polymer shortening . the protein has a repeated motif at both ends separated by a predicted rod like domain suggesting that it may act as an intermolecular linker . these observations suggest that _PROTEIN_ is involved in microtubule polymerization dynamics and/or guidance which in turn influences touch induced directional cell expansion and axial twisting .
the _PROTEIN_ mutant was isolated as a recessive _LOCATION_ mutation in a t dna activation tagging screen for root waving mutants . on agar solidified germination medium that was tilted from the vertical growth of _PROTEIN_ roots skewed in a rightward direction as viewed from above the agar surface whereas wild type col roots grew straight downward . close examination of _PROTEIN_ roots revealed that the epidermal cell files twisted much more in a clockwise direction compared with the wild type as the root moved to the right during the wave motion . _PROTEIN_ root epidermal cell files also exhibited brief left handed twisting similar to the wild type as the root tip moved to the left . during the leftward motions a portion of the _PROTEIN_ root had a tendency to rise off of the agar as the tip pointed toward and grew against the agar surface . measurements of wild type and _PROTEIN_ roots grown under various conditions _PROTEIN_ roots also exhibited a right handed twisting bias when grown within or on vertically oriented agar solidified gm as did airborne _PROTEIN_ etiolated hypocotyls and at times leaf petioles . _PROTEIN_ roots that penetrated the tilted agar surface and grew within the medium however did not skew but instead followed the gravity vector like wild type until encountering the agar/plate interface after which they again skewed to the right . the _PROTEIN_ root axial rotation defect as well as the surface dependent right slanting phenotype were much stronger when seedlings were grown at on either tilted agar solidified gm or vertical agar solidified gm revealing the temperature sensitive nature of these phenotypes . in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ roots had more of a tendency to loop and coil under these conditions than when grown at . growth at had little effect on wild type directional growth . citation found that the right skewing and right handed twisting root growth phenotypes of _PROTEIN_ seedlings were suppressed by the antimicrotubule drug propyzamide . because _PROTEIN_ did not complement the _PROTEIN_ mutation we tested the effects of antimicrotubule drugs on _PROTEIN_ root growth using a range of concentrations . figures and and table show that on tilted medium containing propyzamide _PROTEIN_ and wild type roots both skewed to the left . the dinitroanaline herbicide oryzalin affected root growth similarly with exerting the strongest left skewing effect . oryzalin concentrations higher than inhibited root elongation and abolished slanting and waving . measurements of wild type and _PROTEIN_ seedling roots grown on either agar solidified gm or agar solidified gm with or without an antimicrotubule drug we also quantified root axial twisting by measuring the amount of cell file rotation seen in _PROTEIN_ and wild type roots grown on vertical agar containing gm with or without each of these drugs . we found that on average the right handed axial twisting bias usually seen in _PROTEIN_ roots switched to a left handed twist in the presence of propyzamide as well as oryzalin . wild type col roots which usually do not have a twisting bias also acquired a left handed twist on agar media containing these drugs . the _PROTEIN_ mutant was isolated from a t dna activation tagged population . however the mutation segregated as a single recessive allele suggesting that the phenotype was because of loss of gene function rather than activation of a gene . the original mutant line contained several t dna insertions but after a cross to the wild type a _PROTEIN_ line designated that contained a single t dna insertion was identified . the genomic dna flanking the t dna in was recovered by thermal asymmetric interlaced pcr . the resulting kb fragment contained a region of the t dna left border inserted within the open reading frame of putative gene _GENE_ . to confirm that the disruption of _GENE_ by the t dna insertion was the cause of the _PROTEIN_ mutant phenotype we isolated a kb xhoi genomic fragment from bac that contained the putative _PROTEIN_ gene along with kb upstream and kb downstream sequences . the xhoi fragment which did not carry any other intact annotated genes was cloned into the binary vector and transformed into _PROTEIN_ plants using agrobacterium tumefaciens . analysis of and generation transformants revealed that this fragment was able to complement all of the _PROTEIN_ phenotypic abnormalities . the t dna element responsible for the _PROTEIN_ mutation was inserted at codon within the second exon of a three exon gene predicted to encode a novel amino acid polypeptide . blast searches of genbank identified no _PROTEIN_ homologs outside of plants but identified five other _PROTEIN_ like genes within arabidopsis . these genes were predicted to encode proteins sharing from to amino acid sequence identity with _PROTEIN_ . ests were identified for three of the five _PROTEIN_ like genes . ests for _GENE_ and _GENE_ appeared to be full length supporting the genome project annotations of these genes . twenty ests corresponding to the _PROTEIN_ gene were identified in genbank . many appeared to be full length or nearly full length supporting the annotation of the _PROTEIN_ open reading frame by the genome project . the _PROTEIN_ gene sequence was also annotated as interacting with nitrilase based on a yeast two hybrid screen . however the two hybrid interaction was not confirmed by other means and may have been artifactual . the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ like proteins have a low complexity composition within the middle portions of the polypeptides with some proteins containing continuous stretches of thr residues . the middle portion of _PROTEIN_ is rich in pro and thr residues . a highly conserved direct repeat sequence is present at the n terminal and c terminal ends of these proteins the consensus motif being gggsslg/dylfg . database searches did not report this motif as being present in other proteins . comparison of the _PROTEIN_ sequence to genbank using the maxhom alignment program revealed significant sequence similarity between _PROTEIN_ and a portion of the human filamin a protein . flna is a kd actin cross linking and scaffolding protein consisting of an n terminal actin binding domain and repeat sequences each repeat being amino acids long . _PROTEIN_ shares homology with the repeats and . to determine where the _PROTEIN_ gene is _PROTEIN_ rna gel blots were performed on total rna from various wild type tissues . a kb transcript was identified in all wild type tissues tested including seedling roots and shoots as well as adult leaves inflorescence _METHOD_ and flowers . no transcripts were identified in rna from the _PROTEIN_ mutant confirming that the probe was specific to _PROTEIN_ transcripts and that the _PROTEIN_ mutation was a null . to determine the subcellular localization of the _PROTEIN_ protein we generated transgenic _PROTEIN_ seedlings _PROTEIN_ a _PROTEIN_ green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ fusion consisting of the enhanced _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ open reading frame fused to the c terminus of the predicted _PROTEIN_ open reading frame . to preserve normal regulatory sequences the construct contained the _METHOD_ gene in frame with the genomic _PROTEIN_ gene along with _PROTEIN_ upstream and downstream genomic sequences . this construct complemented the _PROTEIN_ mutant phenotypes in of transgenic plants . confocal microscopic analysis of these seedlings identified _METHOD_ _METHOD_ emanating from the cytoplasm as well as from filamentous structures around the cortex of root and shoot cells . the filamentous patterns were consistent with cortical microtubule localization . for instance within the root tip the filamentous arrays were disorganized within meristematic cells and transversely oriented within elongation zone cells . moreover these arrays at times became oblique then longitudinally oriented within root mature zone cells . because microtubules also form distinctive arrays at others stages of the cell cycle we examined whether _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ localized to preprophase bands phragmoplasts and mitotic spindles in dividing cells . as was the case in the interphase cell cortex _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ related _METHOD_ was visible in patterns consistent with microtubule localization within these arrays . although the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein exhibited _METHOD_ patterns consistent with microtubule localization in most interphase cells the distribution of _METHOD_ was not uniform along the cortical microtubules but instead appeared to be more densely accumulated in specific regions . to investigate this localization further we performed time lapse imaging of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ using confocal microscopy . we observed that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ commonly moved in comet like streaks across the cell cortex . the _METHOD_ in each streak was typically asymmetrically distributed being of highest intensity at the end leading the direction of travel and diminishing exponentially to form a trailing tail . these patterns of localization and movement were consistent with the label showing _PROTEIN_ accumulation at the growing ends of microtubules . by contrast transgenic seedlings _PROTEIN_ a yellow _METHOD_ protein tubulin fusion _METHOD_ exhibited uniform _METHOD_ across cortical microtubules in interphase cells . we asked if the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ comets shared other characteristics displayed by the dynamic ends of cortical microtubules . as predicted _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ microtubule localization appeared de novo at the cell cortex with label moving away from the site of origin just as observed with tubulin _METHOD_ labeled microtubules . the plus ends of cortical microtubules undergo frequent shifts among growth pause and shrinking states a pattern termed dynamic instability . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ comets moved relatively smoothly in one direction but often disappeared abruptly . upon closer examination these episodes of disappearance appeared to be associated with a transition to polymer shrinkage and at times could be clearly imaged because of less dissipation of label along the sidewalls . comets of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were also observed to join and travel along common tracks suggesting the formation and association of individual microtubules into bundles of polymers as also observed with tubulin _METHOD_ . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ patches occasionally appeared to detach from the cortex and were subjected to buffeting by the underlying streaming _LOCATION_ . this behavior would be difficult to explain if the patches of label were not at the ends of the polymers . finally previous observations revealed that the lagging ends of cortical microtubules show slow and persistent depolymerization . we did not observe movement of the _METHOD_ comets consistent with lagging end depolymerization . taken together these observations strongly suggest that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ is concentrated in gradients at the plus ends of growing cortical microtubules and that this tip accumulation is typically sensitive to the growing state of the microtubule . not all observed microtubules labeled with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ displayed pronounced accumulation at the growing end . for instance interphase cells were sometimes observed in which most microtubules showed a more even distribution of label . such cells tended to be in tissue that had been wounded or mounted for extended periods of time . there also was no clearly observed bias in the distribution of label within the phragmoplast mitotic spindle and preprophase band arrays . in time lapse images of these arrays short dashes of label could occasionally be seen in one to three consecutive image frames but this limited information made it difficult to determine if these were end labeled polymers or fragmented polymers . the _PROTEIN_ mutation was originally called _PROTEIN_ . because the _PROTEIN_ mutant exhibited similar phenotypes to the _PROTEIN_ mutant we performed a complementation analysis . when assayed for root skewing the roots of _PROTEIN_ seedlings exhibited a definite left slanting waving pattern like that seen with wild type ler roots . furthermore seedlings displayed approximately a ratio of left slanting to right slanting roots consistent with the independent assortment of two loci . although these data suggested that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were not allelic and were segregating independently the cloning of the corresponding mutations confirmed that they both disrupted the same gene . the _PROTEIN_ allele was the result of a deletion that removed the beginning portion of the _PROTEIN_ gene and the _PROTEIN_ mutant phenotype was rescued by a genomic fragment carrying the _PROTEIN_ gene . moreover citation isolated five _PROTEIN_ alleles all of which contained mutations within the _PROTEIN_ gene . we used primers flanking the _PROTEIN_ deletion as well as primers specific to the _PROTEIN_ t dna to confirm that the _PROTEIN_ by _PROTEIN_ cross was a success . given that both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ seedlings contained no _PROTEIN_ transcripts it is likely that both are null alleles . therefore to explain the complementation data we hypothesize that two independent modifiers exist one with a dominant allele in the col background and the other with a dominant allele in the ler background . these modifiers produce left slanting roots when dihybrid in a _PROTEIN_ null background . however when either or both of these modifiers is homozygous recessive in a _PROTEIN_ null background the resultant phenotype is right skewing roots . according to this hypothesis one would expect that one sixteenth of the _PROTEIN_ by _PROTEIN_ plants would be double homozygous dominant for the modifiers and would produce homozygous left slanting families of plants . indeed we found that five out of plants produced families that were homozygous left slanting . this data does not fit the ratio one would expect associated with a single modifier . moreover of the families proved to be heterozygous and as expected were segregating either left right skewing or left right skewing . the remaining of plants that had right skewing roots all gave rise to families that were homozygous right skewing which is very close to the expected ratio . previously citation reported that cortical microtubules in _PROTEIN_ root elongation zone cells were oriented in left handed oblique arrays instead of being transversely oriented like in the wild type . they hypothesized that the orientations of cortical arrays govern the direction of cell expansion thus oblique arrays caused the _PROTEIN_ root axial twisting phenotype . to determine if _PROTEIN_ elongating root cells also had left handed obliquely oriented microtubule arrays we grew _PROTEIN_ and wild type seedlings on vertical agar solidified gm for d at fixed the tissue and stained for tubulin using whole mount _METHOD_ . under our conditions the cortical microtubule arrays within _PROTEIN_ elongating root cells were mostly transverse and on average were slightly right handed oblique instead of left handed oblique throughout the entire distal and _PROTEIN_ elongation zones even though the _PROTEIN_ roots had been twisting as they grew . this average microtubule pitch angle was statistically indistinguishable from the wild type . when _PROTEIN_ seedlings were grown at which causes a more severe _PROTEIN_ right handed root axial twisting phenotype the microtubule pitch angle in elongation zone cells was on average slightly left handed oblique and statistically different from that of the wild type . however many of the _PROTEIN_ roots had a majority of elongation zone cells with transverse and/or right handed obliquely oriented arrays . moreover even though wild type and _PROTEIN_ average microtubule pitch angles were comparably small there was a big difference in the relative average amounts of wild type and _PROTEIN_ root cell file rotation . to determine whether under our conditions antimicrotubule drugs induced right handed obliquely oriented microtubule arrays as citation and citation reported for propyzamide we examined cortical microtubules in _PROTEIN_ and wild type roots that were growing vertically on agar solidified gm containing either propyzamide or oryzalin . both drug treatments often created right handed obliquely oriented microtubule arrays in _PROTEIN_ and wild type elongating root cells .
