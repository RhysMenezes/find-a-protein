as part of our analysis of branched chain amino acid metabolism in plants we analyzed the function of arabidopsis thaliana branched chain _PROTEIN_ . recombinant _PROTEIN_ showed high efficiency with met and its derivatives and the corresponding oxo acids suggesting its participation in the chain elongation pathway of met derived _PROTEIN_ biosynthesis . this was substantiated by in vivo analysis of two _PROTEIN_ t dna knockout mutants in which met derived aliphatic _PROTEIN_ accumulation is reduced by . the increase in free met and s methylmethionine levels in these mutants together with in vitro substrate specificity strongly implicate _PROTEIN_ in catalysis of the initial deamination of met to methylthio oxobutyrate . _PROTEIN_ transcription is induced by wounding and is predominantly observed in the phloem . _PROTEIN_ transcript accumulation also follows a diurnal rhythm and green _METHOD_ protein tagging experiments and subcellular protein fractions show that _PROTEIN_ is located in the _LOCATION_ . the assignment of _PROTEIN_ to the met chain elongation pathway documents the close evolutionary relationship of this pathway to leu biosynthesis . in addition to _PROTEIN_ the enzyme methylthioalkylmalate synthase has been recruited for the met chain elongation pathway from a gene family involved in leu formation . this suggests that the two pathways have a common evolutionary origin .
in a previous complementation analysis _PROTEIN_ failed to rescue the auxotrophy of a yeast double knockout mutant for bcaas suggesting a function other than typical bcaa metabolism . to get more information about the potential role of this protein we compared atgenexpress _PROTEIN_ profile data of _PROTEIN_ with those of other genes potentially involved in the metabolism of branched chain and other amino acids . this revealed an extraordinarily strong correlation of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ with that of the _PROTEIN_ gene which encodes a methylthioalkylmalate synthase . this enzyme belongs to the isopropylmalate synthase gene family which has four members in arabidopsis . while the function of one of these proteins is unsolved one is most likely engaged in leu biosynthesis . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are enzymes of the chain elongation pathway the first phase in the biosynthesis of met derived _PROTEIN_ . this pathway includes several transamination steps and the striking correlation of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ transcription in arabidopsis suggests that one or more of these steps might be catalyzed by the _PROTEIN_ encoded aminotransferase . to investigate this possibility enzyme assays were performed with recombinant _PROTEIN_ protein and a variety of substrates . the complete _PROTEIN_ reading frame was c terminally fused to the s tag in the vector and _PROTEIN_ in escherichia coli and the resulting protein preparation was considerably enriched by affinity purification with s protein agarose . if _PROTEIN_ were to function in the chain elongation pathway strong activities would be expected with met and its elongated derivatives and with the corresponding oxo acids . the activity of recombinant _PROTEIN_ was first assayed with mtob using a coupled enzyme test established for bcats from animals . this assay has been applied previously to investigate the mitochondrial of arabidopsis . for mtob plotting of reaction velocities and substrate concentrations revealed that the enzyme exhibits michaelis menten kinetics . km and vmax calculated by fitting the data into a nonlinear regression were found to be mm and respectively . based on these results activities with different oxo acids were measured at two substrate concentrations and mm . these are _PROTEIN_ relative to the activity with mtob which was arbitrarily set to . besides the strong activity detected with this substrate considerable activities were found with methylthio oxopentanoate . no activity has been observed with methylthio oxohexanoate methyl oxopentanoate or methyl oxobutyrate the latter being the oxo acids of ile and val respectively . distinct activities were seen with methyl oxopentanoate the oxo acid of leu . while no substrate conversion was detected at a concentration of mm a relative activity of in comparison to mtob was found at mm substrate concentration . no activities were found with a control lysate obtained from e. coli _PROTEIN_ an empty vector confirming that the measured activities originate from overexpressed _PROTEIN_ and not from any copurified e. coli proteins . relative substrate specificities of recombinant _PROTEIN_ to identify optimal concentrations for relative substrate specificity assays with amino acids the kinetic of the deamination of met by the recombinant _PROTEIN_ was determined . this was found to follow a michaelis menten behavior . for met km and vmax values were calculated to be mm and protein respectively . according to these data various substrates were measured at and mm with an hplc based activity and detection system as described in methods . the activity with met was used as standard and was arbitrarily set to . at both substrate concentrations _PROTEIN_ indeed displayed its highest relative activities with this amino acid . substantial activities were also measured with homomethionine and with leu while only little or no activity was detected with ile and val . we also studied the kinetics of _PROTEIN_ with leu and observed a perfect michaelis menten correlation . km and vmax values were found to be mm and protein respectively . thus the affinity of _PROTEIN_ to leu is about five times lower than to met . taken together _PROTEIN_ catalyzes the transamination of typical intermediates of the met chain elongation pathway supporting a role for this protein in this pathway . these results are consistent with the inability of _PROTEIN_ to restore the bcaa auxotrophy of a respective yeast double knockout strain which lacks endogenous bcat activity . to examine the function of _PROTEIN_ in vivo two t dna insertion mutants obtained from the salk and gabi kat collections were investigated . the salk mutant _PROTEIN_ is predicted to contain the t dna in the last exon . an examination of this line by pcr with gene specific primers and oligonucleotides specific for right and left borders confirmed the t dna in the predicted site . the left border primer generates pcr fragments with _PROTEIN_ specific primers annealing to both t dna flanking sequences indicating that at least two left border sequences are present . direct sequencing of these pcr fragments identified the insertion at cdna positions and with respect to the _PROTEIN_ indicating a five nucleotide deletion . the genotype analysis identified plants and to be homozygous for t dna allele _PROTEIN_ while no insertion could be detected in the _PROTEIN_ gene in plant which is _PROTEIN_ as a wild type plant from the salk collection . these plants and a normal columbia wild type were selected for rna gel blot analysis with a _PROTEIN_ specific probe corresponding to exons to amplified with primers _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . a strong signal corresponding to a kb mrna was detected in plants carrying a wild type allele . an nucleotide larger transcript is detected in homozygous _PROTEIN_ plants indicating accumulation of a _PROTEIN_ allele specific transcript . a densitometric quantification of the rna gel blot results revealed the latter to accumulate to of the wild type level . in the gabi kat mutant _PROTEIN_ likewise two t dna left border extremities were found in the predicted location in intron . the rna gel blot analysis again detected kb mrnas in the wild type plants while very small transcripts with a size of < kb were found in _PROTEIN_ homozygous plants and . immunodetection analysis with an antibody raised against the c terminal dodecapeptide of _PROTEIN_ confirmed that a native _PROTEIN_ protein is not detectable in the plants homozygous for alleles _PROTEIN_ and so that these lines are complete knockouts . offspring of mutant plants _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and different wild type plants of ecotype col from various sources including plants and from the salk and gabi kat collections respectively were selected for _PROTEIN_ profiling . in leaves total _PROTEIN_ contents were reduced from dry weight in the wild type to in _PROTEIN_ and from dry weight in the wild type to in _PROTEIN_ . this corresponds to a reduction to and respectively . the reduction is even stronger when only met derived _PROTEIN_ are considered . these secondary compounds were reduced from dry weight in the wild type to in _PROTEIN_ and from dry weight in the wild type to in _PROTEIN_ equivalent to a reduction to and respectively . by contrast total indolic _PROTEIN_ were slightly increased in the mutants . in seeds similar reductions were observed . here total met derived _PROTEIN_ were reduced from in the wild type to in _PROTEIN_ and from in the wild type to in _PROTEIN_ which corresponds to a reduction to and respectively . these reductions are given with respect to the _PROTEIN_ content of the different wild type plants isolated from the seed pool obtained for each mutant and from normal wild type plants . the amounts and profiles measured in the plants are in the range found previously in arabidopsis ecotype col . in leaves of the mutants strong reductions were observed for almost all types of met derived _PROTEIN_ measured including the most abundant methylsulfinylbutylglucosinolate _METHOD_ . only methylsulfinylpentylglucosinolate _METHOD_ remained unaffected in the mutants . likewise in seeds most types of these aliphatic _PROTEIN_ were reduced including the most prominent methylthiobutylglucosinolate . however in this tissue _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ are more abundant in the mutants by a _PROTEIN_ of and respectively . in plant homozygous for _PROTEIN_ almost the same alterations were observed including the increase of _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ levels in seeds and unchanged amounts of _METHOD_ in leaves . a slight discrepancy was observed for hydroxybutylglucosinolate in seeds which was somewhat reduced in plant homozygous for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ but was slightly elevated in plant homozygous for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ content in rosette leaves _PROTEIN_ content in seeds taken together both mutants _PROTEIN_ and clearly have reduced levels of met derived _PROTEIN_ strongly suggesting a participation of _PROTEIN_ in one or several transamination reactions of the met chain elongation pathway . since the _PROTEIN_ reduced in the _PROTEIN_ t dna mutants are derived from met it is possible that a reduction of these secondary metabolites might lead to a buildup of met . we therefore determined and compared the amounts of free amino acids in _PROTEIN_ and homozygous plants with wild type concentrations . indeed in leaves the level of free met was found increased from to and from to nmol/mg dry weight which corresponds to an approximate fivefold _PROTEIN_ and fold _PROTEIN_ increase respectively . all other proteinogenic amino acids measured in this tissue did not show any clear changes except thr which showed an increase of . in seeds a slightly weaker increase of free met was detected from to nmol/mg and to nmol/mg seed with a threefold and fivefold increase in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ respectively compared with the wild type . however in this organ the levels of his ile lys and ser showed significant increases in the mutants . since s adenosylmethionine and smm are the major derivatives of met it seemed probable that the level of at least one of these compounds might also be elevated in the mutants . smm which is the _PROTEIN_ transport form of met is a major constituent of the phloem sap in wheat directed to the developing seeds . it is thus present in the phloem the _PROTEIN_ tissue in which _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ and where an excess of met could lead directly to an increase of this transport compound . to investigate this we measured smm in leaves of wild type plants and found smm at levels of nmol/mg dry weight which is in the range reported previously . in the same tissue of the mutants smm was found to be increased by a _PROTEIN_ of three _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . by contrast a totally different situation was found in seeds . while smm could not be detected in this organ from wild type plants extremely high levels of this compound were observed in _PROTEIN_ and in _PROTEIN_ . these levels exceed almost all other free amino acids measured in seeds of both wild type and mutant plants . this sharp increase of free met and its transport derivative smm further support the conclusion that _PROTEIN_ catalyzes the initial transamination of met in _PROTEIN_ formation generating mtob . free amino acids in rosette leaves free amino acids in seeds in a previous analysis the _PROTEIN_ promoter activity was _PROTEIN_ found in the vasculature of cotyledons and leaves but it remained unclear whether the transcriptional activity resides directly in the veins or in the neighboring tissue . to investigate _PROTEIN_ promoter activity in more detail segments of a flowering stalk of a transgenic plant carrying a _PROTEIN_ promoter _PROTEIN_ construct were histochemically stained and cross sections through the intensively colored ends were inspected by light microscopy . blue staining is restricted to the phloem while no staining could be detected in cells directly adjacent to the phloem cells or in any other cells of the stalk . this includes the so called s cells which have been identified between the phloem and the endodermis of flowering stalks . these cells have been suggested to be the predominant storage sites for _PROTEIN_ . thus biosynthesis of met derived _PROTEIN_ starts in a tissue adjacent to the major storage cells . likewise _PROTEIN_ promoter activity is found in the stele of the roots . the examination of cross sections again identified promoter activity in phloem cells . in leaves _PROTEIN_ promoter activity was almost exclusively found in veins in distinct areas in the basal part of the leaf blade and in petioles . this pattern might be induced when the leaf is cut from the plant . strong staining of the stalk segments is also found at the cut surface . to analyze whether _PROTEIN_ promoter activity is indeed induced by wounding leaf tips were cut off with scissors squeezed with forceps or pierced with a pin while the leaf was still attached to the plant . after min leaves were separated from the plant and transferred to staining buffer . besides the expected staining of the cut surface of the petiole strong staining was seen in veins within or very close to areas of mechanical wounding . staining of untreated control leaves was found only at the site of cutting on the petiole . this strongly suggests that wounding indeed induces _PROTEIN_ promoter activity . to examine this phenomenon by an independent method and to get more information about the time dependence of the response leaves wounded by squeezing were harvested at different time points after treatment and analyzed by rna gel blot analysis with a _PROTEIN_ probe . a fold increase of _PROTEIN_ steady state mrna level can already be observed min after wounding . after that only a small further increase of mrna accumulation was detected . the transcript level starts to drop after h and _METHOD_ to return to the original level after h. a similar pattern is found with the steady state level of _PROTEIN_ mrna . after min the _PROTEIN_ transcript level is increased by a _PROTEIN_ of a maximum is reached after min and the _PROTEIN_ level starts to drop after h . the experiments described above demonstrate that _PROTEIN_ might catalyze the initial and/or other early steps in the chain elongation pathway of met . thus it might be one of the regulators controlling the flux from primary to secondary metabolism . to gather more information about regulation of this gene transcript levels were examined in plants grown under a h h dark regime . leaves were harvested at h intervals and the isolated total rna was inspected by rna gel blot hybridization . while only low _PROTEIN_ mrna levels were observed during the night an up to fivefold increase was found upon illumination . the level remains high under continued exposure to light . an analogous pattern is found in a parallel experiment with _PROTEIN_ demonstrating the light dependent transcript accumulation of both genes . this suggests a diurnal _PROTEIN_ of both proteins and demonstrates that simultaneous _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ extends beyond tissue specificity and promoter activation by wounding to a temporal correlation . the subcellular localization of the met elongation pathway has been so far unclear . the previously identified mam proteins are in silico predicted to be located in _LOCATION_ . this subcellular localization has now been experimentally confirmed for _PROTEIN_ . to address this question for _PROTEIN_ the subcellular targeting of this protein was analyzed by green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ tagging . the cdna representing the complete _PROTEIN_ reading frame was fused to the terminus of the _METHOD_ gene . this construct was then transiently transformed into tobacco protoplasts and targeting of the fusion protein was followed by _METHOD_ microscopy . the green _METHOD_ is seen exclusively in the _LOCATION_ . no _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was found in the _LOCATION_ in which _METHOD_ alone is frequently observed . also no _METHOD_ was detectable in chloroplasts or _LOCATION_ both of which are visible as negative prints within the _LOCATION_ . likewise no green _METHOD_ is found in mitochondria which were specifically stained with mitotracker red or any other subcellular compartment . to investigate the subcellular localization by an independent experimental approach subcellular protein fractions were analyzed for the presence of _PROTEIN_ . a _PROTEIN_ specific and affinity purified antibody binds to this aminotransferase in fractions containing total soluble proteins and in a fraction enriched for _LOCATION_ protein from wild type plants . no _PROTEIN_ protein can be detected in fractions containing purified chloroplasts or mitochondria _PROTEIN_ . the purity of the different fractions was tested with antibodies against _LOCATION_ udp _PROTEIN_ pyrophosphorylase the _LOCATION_ located ferredoxin nadp reductase and the mitochondrial porin . _PROTEIN_ which in arabidopsis presents as two almost identical proteins _METHOD_ is found in the total soluble protein fractions and in the _LOCATION_ fraction but not in chloroplasts and mitochondria documenting that no detectable _LOCATION_ contamination is present in these fractions . the background signal observed in the chloroplast fraction is due to a highly abundant protein of this same size which is also present in the total protein fractions but almost absent from the _LOCATION_ and mitochondrial fractions . this protein is most likely the large subunit of ribulose bisphosphate _PROTEIN_ . fnr proteins are present in the total soluble protein fractions and in the _LOCATION_ fraction but are predominantly found in chloroplasts . no fnr is present in mitochondria . the mitochondrial protein porin is not seen in the total soluble protein fractions in the _LOCATION_ or in the chloroplasts but is clearly detectable in the mitochondrial fraction . these experiments show that mitochondrial and chloroplast fractions are free or almost free of detectable amounts of contaminant proteins from the respective other subcellular fractions while the _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ to be slightly contaminated by _LOCATION_ . however considering the strong enrichment of the _LOCATION_ and chloroplast fractions and the exclusive detection of _PROTEIN_ in the _LOCATION_ these results clearly show that _PROTEIN_ is a _LOCATION_ protein . the relatively weak signal of _PROTEIN_ in the _LOCATION_ is most likely due to the use of protoplasts as a source for the _LOCATION_ preparation . cells of the phloem where _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ are most likely underrepresented in the protoplast preparation since their release from the leaf tissue is less efficient in comparison to mesophyll cells . taken together the two independent experimental approaches consistently show that _PROTEIN_ is a _LOCATION_ enzyme and is thus located in a compartment different from the mam enzymes . no _PROTEIN_ protein is found in the total soluble protein fractions of the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ plants in line with the above characterization of these mutants as complete _PROTEIN_ knockouts .
