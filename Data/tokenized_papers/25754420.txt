potassium is essential for plant growth and development yet the molecular identity of many k transporters remains elusive . here we characterized cation/h exchanger as a _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ k transporter . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was induced by elevated k and histochemical analysis of _PROTEIN_ promoter gus transgenic plants indicated that _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ in xylem parenchyma of root and shoot vascular tissues of seedlings . _PROTEIN_ knockout _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ overexpression seedlings displayed different growth phenotypes during k stress as compared with seedlings . roots of mutant seedlings displayed higher k uptake rates than roots . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in yeast cells deficient in k uptake renders the mutant cells more sensitive to deficiencies of k in the medium . _PROTEIN_ mediates k efflux in yeast cells loaded with high k . uptake experiments using as a tracer for k with both yeast and plant mutants demonstrated that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in yeast and in planta mediated k efflux . functional green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ versions of _PROTEIN_ were localized to both the yeast and plant _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . taken together we suggest that _PROTEIN_ is a _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ k efflux transporter involved in k homeostasis and k recirculation .
the chxs are a subfamily of secondary _LOCATION_ transporters in the arabidopsis genome . both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ along with _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ comprise iii of the chx transporters which are different from several characterized chxs . was performed to clone the _PROTEIN_ open reading frame from a cdna library of pollen grains . the _PROTEIN_ cdna comprises nucleotides which could encode a protein with amino acids . _PROTEIN_ shows the highest identity and similarity with _PROTEIN_ suggesting that they are products of an ancient gene duplication . in contrast _PROTEIN_ shares identity and similarity with _PROTEIN_ identity and similarity with _PROTEIN_ and identity and similarity with yeast . the putative _PROTEIN_ protein contains transmembrane domains . these data suggest that _PROTEIN_ is most closely related to _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis . while _PROTEIN_ transcripts could be detected in all tissues by reverse transcriptase _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was enhanced by mm kcl and also marginally induced by k depletion . plants exposed to mm kcl treatment demonstrated that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ markedly increased in the root root shoot junction stem/petiole and leaf tissues particularly in stem/petioles . the public microarray database also collaborates that _PROTEIN_ is slightly induced by k starvation . we also noted that _PROTEIN_ showed enhanced _PROTEIN_ in cells in close proximity to vascular tissues . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in response to k levels was further confirmed by native _PROTEIN_ gus activity assays . _PROTEIN_ gus activity was detected in vascular tissues and junction vascular tissues between roots and shoots of seedlings after h of reaction with the gus substrate . enhanced gus staining was examined in seedlings grown for d in k media and gus activity was increased in seedlings grown for d in mm k media . at high k levels the _PROTEIN_ gus activity was detected not only in hypocotyls and roots but also in whole cotyledons .the k _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ gus was seen over a range of k concentrations . analyses of _PROTEIN_ gus activity and northern blot data indicated _PROTEIN_ displayed enhanced _PROTEIN_ in response to k fluctuations . cross sections of _PROTEIN_ gus roots showed that _PROTEIN_ was primarily _PROTEIN_ in xylem parenchyma in roots under mm kcl but can extend to both xylem parenchyma and root procambium and other tissues after mm kcl . this is consistent with public microarray data and the arabidopsis _METHOD_ browser _METHOD_ . to determine the function of _PROTEIN_ in planta we obtained two independent insertion lines for _PROTEIN_ . to confirm the insertion site and select homozygous lines screening was performed using _PROTEIN_ specific primers and primers . sequencing of the fragments confirmed that the insertions were located within the coding sequences of both open reading frames . no _PROTEIN_ transcripts could be detected from total rna isolated from the respective mutant flowers . the two _PROTEIN_ lines showed no obvious morphological or growth defects compared with control plants under standard growth conditions . previously we characterized _PROTEIN_ lines and in order to dissect the functional relationship between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ we now generated _PROTEIN_ double mutants . crosses between homozygous _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were performed and homozygous _PROTEIN_ double mutants were identified among individuals by pcr . _PROTEIN_ like _PROTEIN_ is found in relatively low abundance in plants thus _PROTEIN_ overexpression transgenic lines driven by the camv promoter were also generated . in these lines _PROTEIN_ mrna levels were significantly higher than that in vector controls . despite the increased amounts of _PROTEIN_ levels in these lines no obvious change in plant growth and development was detected when the plants were grown under standard growth conditions . under standard growth conditions _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ single mutants _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ lines grew in a manner similar to control lines . however when these lines were germinated and grown on low k in media at varying ph levels _PROTEIN_ seedlings appeared to exhibit slightly more robust grow than controls . in comparison _PROTEIN_ lines grew to a reduced size compared with _PROTEIN_ lines but at a rate similar to _PROTEIN_ lines . measurements of total chlorophyll and fresh weight analysis in these lines quantify the growth differences . _PROTEIN_ lines contained more chlorophyll and increased _METHOD_ compared with the controls whereas _PROTEIN_ lines had much lower _METHOD_ and chlorophyll levels than controls . interestingly the transgenic lines that _PROTEIN_ high levels of _PROTEIN_ displayed more sensitivity to low k conditions and less growth when compared with controls which were similar to _PROTEIN_ lines . these phenotypes were accentuated on media with low k content as _PROTEIN_ knockout lines were more tolerant in low k conditions while _PROTEIN_ overexpression lines were more sensitive to k . in order to understand how changes of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ altered k homeostasis in plants efflux and uptake kinetics of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ transgenic and vector control seedlings were analysed . however it is difficult to measure k flux from whole roots since _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in vascular tissues . we thus measured uptake activity by measuring and uptake into roots of k plants since _PROTEIN_ is also induced by k starvation like _PROTEIN_ . the initial uptake of was linear in all lines for min with uptake being higher for the _PROTEIN_ line than the _PROTEIN_ and control lines . uptake rates for revealed a difference between vector control and _PROTEIN_ lines at both low and high k concentrations . at high k concentrations the difference in uptake kinetics could be seen between vector control and _PROTEIN_ lines . _PROTEIN_ lines demonstrated a _PROTEIN_ in uptake at low k concentrations compared with vector controls whereas the _PROTEIN_ lines displayed higher uptake rates than vector controls . to evaluate the _PROTEIN_ efflux the difference between the uptake rates of vector controls and _PROTEIN_ was measured . a plot of the difference in uptake rates as a function of k concentration approximates a saturable system with a km of and vmax of . to understand the efflux transport mediated by _PROTEIN_ we measured uptake in _PROTEIN_ lines as compared with control plants under different ph conditions and in the presence of the protonophore cccp . it was observed that optimal uptake was measured at alkali ph conditions and the protonophore inhibited k uptake in these experiments suggesting that _PROTEIN_ k efflux is dependent on a ph or electrochemical gradient . since _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was induced when plants were grown under high k concentration conditions we germinated and grew these lines in _METHOD_ plates containing mm kcl . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and overexpression lines showed opposite growth phenotypes in comparison with lines grown on mm k plates . both knockout lines grew more slowly than wild type in mm kcl . given the plethora of k uptake transporters working in the root vascular system we posit there must be some k transporters to translocate high levels of k to other tissues to attenuate a potentially toxic load of k in the roots . our working model suggests a specific and strong of _PROTEIN_ by mm k which might be employed to limit toxicity of k . to test this point we transferred young seedlings to _METHOD_ containing mm kcl . as previously established the elongation of both primary roots of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ was less than wild type however roots of the overexpression lines grew better than wild type . when the k content in roots _METHOD_ and leaves from these k seedlings was analysed root k content of the two overexpression lines were low whereas the two knockout lines were high . however k content in leaves and _METHOD_ of these seedlings under high k stress showed opposite trends _METHOD_ and leaves of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ contained less k than controls whereas _METHOD_ and leaves from overexpression lines contained more k and in _PROTEIN_ lines they displayed the lowest total cellular k content . these data suggest that _PROTEIN_ might transport excess k in roots to leaf and hypocotyl cells to minimize the localized stress and at the same time to redistribute k . yeast has been employed as a powerful tool to characterize the functions of plant transporters . to further characterize the function of _PROTEIN_ we _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in various yeast mutants . in most yeast strains such as _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ did not strongly complement the k /na phenotypes of these mutants . however there were subtle k related phenotypes caused by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . for example we were able to obtain a phenotype in the yeast mutant that lacks functional _PROTEIN_ and and displays high sensitivity to lower k under acidic conditions . when vector controls and _PROTEIN_ were _PROTEIN_ in both yeast strains grew indistinguishably in media supplemented with mm kcl whereas vector controls were not able to grow in the media without addition of kcl . _PROTEIN_ of coding an arabidopsis k channel could suppress the hypersensitivity of to lower k . while _PROTEIN_ can suppress the mutant phenotype _PROTEIN_ could not . in _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ cells were more sensitive than the vector controls to the lower k media . this observation implies a distinct role for _PROTEIN_ in k homeostasis . the accumulation profile of several elements was determined in these yeast strains . as shown previously k content in _PROTEIN_ cells was significantly higher than that of the vector controls while the _PROTEIN_ cells accumulated less k under these growth conditions suggesting that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ can reduce k accumulation in yeast . we then performed k uptake using radioactive as a tracer to test _PROTEIN_ function in cells . we compared uptake of cells _PROTEIN_ the empty vector and cells _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . under mm and mm external k _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ cells displayed higher k uptake rates compared with vector controls whereas k uptake by _PROTEIN_ cells was lower than vector controls suggesting that _PROTEIN_ has separate functions from _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . we then performed kinetic analysis to monitor k efflux . initial uptake rates were plotted as a function of external k concentration . k uptake in _PROTEIN_ yeast was clearly lower than the vector control . we inferred _PROTEIN_ k efflux rates through the difference in uptakes rates between _PROTEIN_ and yeast cells . reciprocal plots for _PROTEIN_ yeast cells showed a km for k of and vmax of nmol cells . we then tested the mode of _PROTEIN_ k efflux . similarly we found that ph and cccp a protonophore significantly affected _PROTEIN_ k efflux which was higher at ph relative to ph and cccp reduced k uptake . _PROTEIN_ had little to no effect on these measurements suggesting that energy from _PROTEIN_ metabolites was not limiting and k uptake was dependent on a ph gradient .to further test k efflux activity of _PROTEIN_ we _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in mutant cells which are deficient in _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ k /na efflux . null _PROTEIN_ mutants of s. cerevisiae exhibit a uptake of k and rb . when _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ mutant strain _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ caused yeast cells to more sensitive to k .furthermore when _PROTEIN_ in strain _PROTEIN_ made cells more resistant to high concentrations of k . although _PROTEIN_ could not completely suppress the sensitivity of mutant cells to high concentrations of k we could assay _PROTEIN_ k efflux in mutant cells . measuring the k release from _PROTEIN_ mutant cells loaded with high concentrations of k also showed that _PROTEIN_ a and proton k efflux transport . this was consistent with a mechanism by which _PROTEIN_ mediates k efflux under alkali conditions in other yeast cells . to determine the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ we _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ as a fusion protein with the of the _METHOD_ . the addition of _METHOD_ did not appear to alter the function of _PROTEIN_ since _METHOD_ yeast cells grew in a manner indistinguishable from _PROTEIN_ cells . _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in yeast cells showed similar localization with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ in contrast to the uniform cytoplasmic labelling in cells _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ only . the _METHOD_ fusion proteins under the control of the promoter were transiently _PROTEIN_ in tobacco epidermal cells by biolistic transformation . when imaged by confocal microscopy _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ cells displayed intense _METHOD_ confined to the cell periphery which is strongly indicative of _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ localization . to exclude the possibility that _METHOD_ is localized to the cell wall onion cells were plasmolysed by treatment with m sucrose . the _METHOD_ in the plasmolysed cells detached from the cell wall consistent with the premise that the _METHOD_ signal was not emanating from the cell wall . also similar to the signal from _METHOD_ _METHOD_ signal showed strong _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ localization rather than tonoplast localization .
