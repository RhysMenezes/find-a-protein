synaptotagmins are calcium sensors that regulate synaptic vesicle exo/endocytosis . thought to be exclusive to animals they have recently been characterized in plants . we show that arabidopsis synaptotagmin _PROTEIN_ regulates endosome recycling and movement protein _PROTEIN_ mediated trafficking of plant virus genomes through plasmodesmata . _PROTEIN_ localizes to endosomes in plant cells and directly binds the distinct cabbage leaf curl virus and tobacco mosaic virus cell to cell movement proteins . in a _PROTEIN_ knockdown line calcuv systemic infection is delayed and cell to cell spread of tmv and calcuv movement proteins is inhibited . a dominant negative _PROTEIN_ mutant causes depletion of _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ derived endosomes produces large intracellular vesicles attached to _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and inhibits cell to cell trafficking of tmv and calcuv movement proteins when tested in an agrobacterium based leaf _PROTEIN_ assay . our studies show that _PROTEIN_ regulates endocytosis and suggest that distinct virus movement proteins transport their cargos to plasmodesmata for cell to cell spread via an endocytic recycling pathway .
we used the yeast sos recruitment screen to identify arabidopsis proteins that interacted with _PROTEIN_ and could be involved in virus movement . we independently identified _PROTEIN_ six times in our arabidopsis cdna library from clones . in each clone the _PROTEIN_ coding sequence extended from the utr at least through the _PROTEIN_ domain . our longest cdna began just after the start of the _PROTEIN_ domain and corresponded to the nt of a predicted synaptotagmin gene on arabidopsis chromosome _PROTEIN_ . we cloned full length _PROTEIN_ cdna from col poly containing rna by and _PROTEIN_ . on the basis of our annotation this was nt in length with a nt utr a nt coding region and a nt utr . the _PROTEIN_ locus has exons and introns and would encode a aa protein with one aa tm region and a domain structure characteristic of animal syts . _PROTEIN_ is one of five putative synaptotagmin genes in arabidopsis which like animal syts are highly divergent in sequence . _PROTEIN_ is predicted to localize to _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ or _LOCATION_ with a _LOCATION_ c terminal tail . _PROTEIN_ directly interacted in vitro with the fusion protein _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in which _PROTEIN_ lacked the n terminal signal peptide and tm . when we incubated met labeled wild type _PROTEIN_ in vitro with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or with _PROTEIN_ each purified from escherichia coli and tethered to glutathione sepharose _PROTEIN_ bound to _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ but not to _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and the distinct tmv also specifically bound to _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ vs. _PROTEIN_ in vitro . to further control for specificity we tested luciferase . in contrast to the three movement proteins luciferase did not bind to _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ . thus _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and the distinct tmv all interacted with _PROTEIN_ in vitro suggesting that _PROTEIN_ might be involved in begomovirus and tobamovirus cell to cell movement . to show that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ interaction was important for virus infection and reveal possible roles for _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis we sought t dna insertions in _PROTEIN_ . we found only one line sail _PROTEIN_ and verified that the t dna was in exon just to the _PROTEIN_ coding sequence . this was the sole t dna insertion based on segregation when we germinated seed on mg/l bialaphos . we tested six plants in a segregating population by pcr based genotyping and identified three homozygous and three heterozygous lines . homozygous lines and were knocked down in _PROTEIN_ transcript levels . they produced a predicted truncated _PROTEIN_ transcript which encoded a chimeric _PROTEIN_ protein that was smaller than wt _PROTEIN_ due to a stop codon in the t dna . to show this and assess _PROTEIN_ levels we analyzed protein extracts from day old _PROTEIN_ line and wt seedlings on immunoblots using polyclonal antisera against the _PROTEIN_ variable domain . we detected full length kda _PROTEIN_ in wt col and the kda smaller _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ line where it accumulated to only of wt _PROTEIN_ . these results confirmed the specificity of our antisera for _PROTEIN_ . our three _PROTEIN_ homozygous lines did not exhibit striking phenotypes when grown under long or short day conditions or continuous light and had normal fecundity . this suggested that the truncated _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ intact did function or different syts had overlapping functions . to test whether reduced _PROTEIN_ levels affected virus infection we inoculated _PROTEIN_ lines and or wt col with calcuv . calcuv infection progressed more slowly in _PROTEIN_ in contrast to col with its infected plants and typical disease _METHOD_ first evident at d postinoculation . in _PROTEIN_ disease _METHOD_ were attenuated and delayed days in onset and infectivity levels were lower . we confirmed this by semiquantitative pcr using viral nsp specific primers to quantify calcuv dna levels in extracts from systemically infected leaves at d postinoculation . calcuv dna accumulated in symptomatic systemic leaves from _PROTEIN_ to of the levels in wt col plants . thus _PROTEIN_ was necessary for calcuv systemic spread and infection in arabidopsis consistent with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ interaction being important for virus movement . to demonstrate a role for _PROTEIN_ in viral movement protein function we developed two leaf based transient _PROTEIN_ assays . we _PROTEIN_ agroinfiltration to test whether a dominant negative form of _PROTEIN_ interfered with tmv and _PROTEIN_ cell to cell trafficking when these were _PROTEIN_ as functional _METHOD_ fusions _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in nicotiana benthamiana . we also used biolistic bombardment to transiently _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis . we cloned two potential dominant negative _PROTEIN_ mutants for agroinfiltration an n terminal tagged myc _PROTEIN_ that lacked the signal peptide and tm and a c terminal tagged _PROTEIN_ myc lacking the _PROTEIN_ domain . myc _PROTEIN_ should be _LOCATION_ and could compete with endogenous _PROTEIN_ to bind and mislocalize tmv or _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ myc would target properly but be inactive as _PROTEIN_ is essential for function . to test these predictions we _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in n. benthamiana leaf protoplasts each as c terminal _METHOD_ fusions from the constitutive promoter . at h posttransfection the earliest we detected each fusion full length _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ localized to distinct patches in the cortical region of the cell and by h was in tight vesicle like structures at or near the cell periphery . this resembled the pattern of _PROTEIN_ a unique plant that appears to be on early/sorting endosomes . to examine this localization more precisely we labeled protoplasts for min with a dye that fluoresces when inserted into the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and labels endosomes . like _PROTEIN_ labeled most of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ labeled vesicle like structures suggesting that _PROTEIN_ localized to _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ derived endosomes . fitting with this observation _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ labeled localized areas of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and endosomes when transiently _PROTEIN_ in n. benthamiana leaves . at h _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was diffuse in the _LOCATION_ and in a few irregular patches by h it was in large irregular patches possibly aggregates or associated with _LOCATION_ which were distinct from _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ vesicles at h. in contrast based on labeling and coexpression of the _LOCATION_ marker kdel _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ accumulated at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and in reticulate _LOCATION_ with a few vesicles rarely seen at the cell periphery by h . this showed that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was functional and that the _PROTEIN_ domain was required for _PROTEIN_ to translocate from the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ onto endosomes . we concluded that _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ could act as a dominant negative mutant . to assay _PROTEIN_ function we coinfiltrated two a. tumefaciens cultures . one would _PROTEIN_ high levels of myc _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ myc or c terminal myc tagged intact _PROTEIN_ from the promoter . the other _PROTEIN_ either tmv _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ from the estradiol inducible promoter . in this way once the _PROTEIN_ construct accumulated we induced synchronous _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ with estradiol . to visualize cell to cell movement we optimized ratios so that most infiltrated cells _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ construct but in cells _PROTEIN_ the movement protein at h. on the basis of immunoblots of protein extracts from infiltrated sectors probed with myc antibody all _PROTEIN_ constructs accumulated to comparable levels . to control for leaf variation in each trial we compared plasmid pairs that were agroinfiltrated into different sectors on the same leaf . we also agroinfiltrated tmv _METHOD_ alone or with untransformed a. tumefaciens to assess the competence of the leaf for and the baseline level of movement for the amount of coinfiltrated bacteria . as with microinjection or biolistic bombardment tmv _METHOD_ imaged by confocal laser scanning microscopy _PROTEIN_ localized to punctate _METHOD_ spots at the cell wall in agroinfiltrated n. benthamiana leaves and spread cell to cell over time based on the number of foci having two or more adjacent vs. single _METHOD_ cells . we first detected _METHOD_ at h postinduction at which time it was confined to isolated single cells in of foci . cell to cell spread of _METHOD_ to adjacent cells was first evident h _PROTEIN_ than biolistic assays at h postinduction . to further show that this was cell to cell movement we coinfiltrated the _LOCATION_ marker hdel _METHOD_ which does not move between cells with an empty binary vector or with _PROTEIN_ using the same amounts of bacteria as in our movement assays . like _METHOD_ at h postinduction of hdel _METHOD_ examined up to h postinfiltration was confined to single cells with in two adjacent cells . it was rarely seen in clusters of three cells . neither _PROTEIN_ myc nor myc _PROTEIN_ inhibited _METHOD_ cell to cell trafficking . in a typical assay tmv _METHOD_ spread to adjacent cells of the time when coexpressed with _PROTEIN_ myc or myc _PROTEIN_ or coinfiltrated with . hence overexpressing _PROTEIN_ did not nonspecifically inhibit cell to cell trafficking by overloading the secretory pathway or sequestering to impair cell function . in contrast _PROTEIN_ myc did inhibit _METHOD_ cell to cell trafficking . in the same trial _METHOD_ spread to adjacent cells in only of foci when coexpressed with _PROTEIN_ myc compared to of foci when coexpressed with _PROTEIN_ myc myc _PROTEIN_ or . in addition _METHOD_ spread beyond two cells less frequently when coexpressed with _PROTEIN_ myc . we obtained comparable results for _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ cell to cell trafficking in this assay . effects of _PROTEIN_ variants or _PROTEIN_ knockdown on movement protein spread on the basis of analysis _PROTEIN_ myc significantly inhibited cell to cell transport compared to _PROTEIN_ myc and myc _PROTEIN_ the latter three did not vary significantly . thus _PROTEIN_ myc specifically interfered with tmv and _PROTEIN_ cell to cell trafficking . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ myc did not notably alter the subcellular localization of _METHOD_ or _PROTEIN_ retained in single cells suggesting that _PROTEIN_ did not recruit either to the cell wall region . to extend these results we used biolistic bombardment to transiently _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis . tmv _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ moved to adjacent cells of the time in wt col rosette leaves . in contrast the cell to cell trafficking of both proteins was strikingly inhibited in _PROTEIN_ knockdown lines and _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ spread to adjacent cells only or of the time respectively . fitting with our infectivity studies these findings suggest that _PROTEIN_ regulates cell to cell trafficking of these two viral movement proteins via pd and that the mutated form of _PROTEIN_ must be targeted through the secretory pathway to inhibit movement protein transport . to establish the role of _PROTEIN_ in _LOCATION_ trafficking in plant cells and thereby understand its role in virus movement we examined the effects of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ on the localization of _METHOD_ markers specific for secretory and endosomal compartments and on the uptake of using our n. benthamiana transient assay . if _PROTEIN_ regulates vesicular traffic at a stage along the secretory pathway then _PROTEIN_ should block a stage in trafficking visualized by specific _METHOD_ markers accumulating in inappropriate upstream compartments . to assess this we used _METHOD_ hdel _LOCATION_ n st _METHOD_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ or secreted _METHOD_ . if _PROTEIN_ regulates a stage in endocytosis then _PROTEIN_ should alter the pattern of labeling and of the endosomal marker _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . all _PROTEIN_ constructs were _PROTEIN_ at comparable levels . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or control did not affect any stage along the secretory pathway nor did they affect the pattern of endosomes visualized after brief to h labeling with . _LOCATION_ to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ trafficking compartment morphology secretion and endocytosis all appeared to be normal on the basis of the pattern of _METHOD_ hdel labeled _LOCATION_ the number and motility of n st _METHOD_ labeled _LOCATION_ the uniform labeling and morphology of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ accumulation in the apoplast and the large numbers of labeled endosomal vesicles . these last were smaller than _LOCATION_ and not distributed along _LOCATION_ . n st _METHOD_ did not increase in _LOCATION_ and _METHOD_ did not back up in the _LOCATION_ or _LOCATION_ and _METHOD_ did not accumulate in the _LOCATION_ . _PROTEIN_ also did not affect the secretory pathway however it did lead to the depletion of endosomes and accumulation of large labeled vesicles that appeared to be attached to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . thus _PROTEIN_ inhibited the formation of _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ derived endosomes . to show that these were early/sorting endosomes and not at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ we coexpressed _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ with _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ alone or with _PROTEIN_ specifically labeled endosomes . in contrast _PROTEIN_ caused _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ to accumulate in large vesicles at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . we conclude that _PROTEIN_ regulates endocytosis and endosome recycling at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in plant cells but not _LOCATION_ traffic along the secretory pathway . _PROTEIN_ specifically inhibited both these processes and the cell to cell trafficking of tmv and _PROTEIN_ thereby providing a functional link between these two pathways . this suggests that tmv and _PROTEIN_ transport their cargos to pd for cell to cell spread via an endocytic recycling pathway .
