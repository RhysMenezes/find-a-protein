an arabidopsis qc snare protein is localized to _LOCATION_ organelles and is involved in salt and osmotic stress responses via accumulation of na in _LOCATION_ . to reduce the detrimental effects of environmental stresses plants have evolved many defense _METHOD_ . here we identified an arabidopsis qc snare gene involved in salt and osmotic stress responses using an activation tagging method . both activation tagged plants and overexpressing transgenic plants of the gene were tolerant to high concentrations of nacl licl and mannitol whereas loss of function mutants were sensitive to nacl licl and mannitol . transcription increased under nacl aba cold and mannitol stresses but not mv treatment . _METHOD_ fusion protein was juxtaposed with _LOCATION_ marker implying that its function is associated with _LOCATION_ mediated transport . quantitative measurement of na using induced coupled _LOCATION_ atomic emission spectroscopy revealed that oxs accumulated significantly more na than wt plants . in addition na dependent _METHOD_ analysis of sodium green showed comparatively higher na accumulation in _LOCATION_ of ox cells than in those of wt plant cells after salt treatments . taken together our findings suggest that a _LOCATION_ qc snare protein plays an important role in salt and osmotic stress responses and functions in the salt stress response via sequestration of na in _LOCATION_ .
to isolate salt stress responsive genes we screened t activation tagging lines of arabidopsis harboring an activation tagging vector as previously described by lee et al . and isolated _PROTEIN_ line plants showing a salt tolerance phenotype . we confirmed that seedlings of the _PROTEIN_ line were tolerant to or mm nacl with higher fresh weight than wt plants . to identify the t dna insertion site in _PROTEIN_ we isolated genomic dna from _PROTEIN_ plants and performed tail pcr . the amplified pcr fragments were subjected to sequencing analysis and the results reveal that camv enhancers were inserted between _GENE_ and on chromosome . _GENE_ encodes a qc snare protein whereas encodes a ribosomal protein . to identify genes activated by camv enhancer in _PROTEIN_ we analyzed transcription levels of _GENE_ and in plants of _PROTEIN_ by semi quantitative rt pcr . in our results _PROTEIN_ was elevated in _PROTEIN_ line plants compared to wt plants . we searched homologs using snare motif of by blastp program and found proteins showing high similarity with including which is a paralog of in arabidopsis . interestingly all of those proteins were plant proteins indicating that the snare motif of is well conserved only in plants . it has been reported that is one of the total qc snares in arabidopsis . phylogenetic analysis of these arabidopsis qc snares found that and which belong to the subfamily were the most closely related to the subfamily of qc snares that include and . multiple alignment analysis showed that the qc snares of arabidopsis share specific conserved qc snare domains ranging in length from to aa mostly having q residue as the layer residue in center of snare motif . to confirm the role of in the abiotic stress response we generated oxs overexpressing under control of the camv promoter . we selected three independent t lines of oxs by semi quantitative rt pcr for further study . similar to _PROTEIN_ line plants oxs showed higher tolerance to or mm nacl than wt plants . oxs were also more tolerant to or mm licl than wt plants . additionally oxs were resistant to or mm mannitol . however oxs did not show significant difference compared to wt plants upon mv treatment . we then measured water loss rates in oxs and wt plants under dehydration conditions to further confirm tolerance of oxs to osmotic stress . water loss was significantly slower in oxs than in wt plants . all of the three independent t lines of oxs showed similar results . these results indicate that is involved in the responses to salt and osmotic stresses and overexpression of confers tolerance to salt and osmotic stresses . since _PROTEIN_ line plants and oxs showed tolerant phenotypes to salt and osmotic stresses we investigated the response of mutants to salt and osmotic stresses . two t dna inserted mutants of in which t dna was inserted in the untranslated region of and in which t dna was inserted in the third exon of were obtained from the signal collection at the salk institute . we first selected homozygous mutants of and then confirmed down regulation of _PROTEIN_ using semi quantitative rt pcr . we then investigated the response of mutants to salt and osmotic stresses and found that mutants displayed greater sensitivity to or mm nacl as well as or mm licl . in addition mutants were more sensitive to or mm mannitol . however mutants did not show any significant difference compared to wt plants upon mv treatment . we then measured water loss rates in mutants as well as wt plants under dehydration conditions . water loss was significantly faster in mutants compared to wt plants . combined with the ox results this finding indicates that is involved in salt and osmotic stress responses . on the other hand similar to mutants mutants also showed more sensitivity to salt stress compared to wt plants suggesting that the phenotype of mutants can be attributed to down regulation of _PROTEIN_ . the tolerance of oxs and sensitivity of mutants to salt and osmotic stresses suggests that is involved in salt and osmotic stress responses in arabidopsis . thus we further investigated _PROTEIN_ patterns of under abiotic stress conditions . quantitative rt pcr analysis using day old wt seedlings showed that transcription was highly elevated by nacl cold and aba treatments and slightly increased upon mannitol treatment suggesting that is involved in salt and osmotic stress responses . however transcription was slightly reduced or unchanged upon mv treatment . combined with the phenotypic analysis of oxs and mutants upon mv treatment this result suggests that might not be involved in the oxidative stress response . a rice ortholog of also showed no change in transcription under oxidative stress conditions . semi quantitative rt pcr analysis showed very similar results to those of quantitative rt pcr in which transcription level of was significantly elevated by nacl cold and aba treatments slightly increased by mannitol and reduced or unaltered by mv treatment . we also investigated the spatial and temporal _PROTEIN_ patterns of in arabidopsis by quantitative rt pcr . showed almost constitutive transcription as plants developed with higher _PROTEIN_ at dag . in mature plants transcription was strongly detected in rosette leaves compared to other organs suggesting that plays an important role in rosette leaves . it has also been reported that is _PROTEIN_ in vegetative tissues such as _METHOD_ and leaves but almost no _PROTEIN_ was observed in reproductive tissues such as flowering _PROTEIN_ . to investigate the subcellular localization of arabidopsis protoplasts were transformed with _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ fusion vector . signals of both constructs were either overlapped or juxtaposed with _LOCATION_ signal although _METHOD_ intensity of _METHOD_ was weaker than that of _METHOD_ indicating that plays a role in the _LOCATION_ mediated transport . it was reported that a putative ortholog of in yeast is localized to the _LOCATION_ compartment and required for vesicle transport from intra _LOCATION_ compartments suggesting that might also be involved in vesicle transport via the _LOCATION_ . ion accumulation in _LOCATION_ is important for countering salt stress and mediated by _LOCATION_ transporters such as na /h antiporters in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . it has been also reported that the snare complex plays an important role in the _LOCATION_ fusion process and snare proteins are involved in the control of ion transport . to determine whether or not the salt tolerance of oxs is due to increased ion accumulation inside cells we quantitatively measured the content of na in wt plants oxs and mutants using icp aes . na content in oxs was significantly higher than in wt plants and mutants after mm nacl treatment . this result suggests that is involved in na accumulation of arabidopsis cells . to investigate the impact of on subcellular localization of na accumulation under salt stress condition we monitored the distribution of na in root cells after mm nacl treatment for h using na dependent _METHOD_ of sodium green a cell permeable sodium indicator . sodium green is not _METHOD_ in the apoplast but becomes _METHOD_ after entering the cell and binding to na and it has been used as a _METHOD_ indicator of na in root _LOCATION_ of arabidopsis and wheat . in response to mm nacl na accumulation in _LOCATION_ of ox cells was significantly higher than that in _LOCATION_ of wt plant cells whereas na accumulation in _LOCATION_ of mutant cells was similar to that in _LOCATION_ of wt plant cells . these results indicate that is involved in accumulation of na in _LOCATION_ conferring salt tolerance to arabidopsis under salt stress conditions . it was reported that after high concentration of nacl treatment the _LOCATION_ markedly increases in volume without an increase in overall cell volume or cell division and _LOCATION_ occupies most of cell . in addition intracellular compartmentation of na within _LOCATION_ was found to have a decisive effect on plant salt tolerance . taken together our results suggest that a _LOCATION_ qc snare protein is involved in salt and osmotic stress responses and functions in the salt stress response via the accumulation of na in _LOCATION_ . most experiments and data analyses were performed by both v. n. tarte and h.
