the arabidopsis atkea gene family contains six members named _PROTEIN_ through _PROTEIN_ . based on amino acid sequences atkea are predicted to encode k /h antiporters with transmembrane spanning domains . the atkea genes are named in _PROTEIN_ order of sequence similarity to _PROTEIN_ except for _PROTEIN_ which has a higher similarity than _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ are similar to _PROTEIN_ whereas _PROTEIN_ are similar to each other but only similar to the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . the atkea gene family _METHOD_ two subgroups in cladogram _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . the family members are listed in order of sequence similarity beginning with the prototype _PROTEIN_ . accession numbers corresponding to the genbank database are given in parentheses . the predicted amino acid sequences of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were aligned based on analysis using the clustalx method . identical or similar residues are blocked as dark or light boxes respectively . putative transmembrane domains were analyzed using the tmhmm method and are marked at the approximate tm regions . cladogram analysis was conducted using mega . the alignment was based on the predicted amino acid sequences of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . evolutionary distances were computed by the neighbor joining method . the scale bar indicates the distance calculated from the multiple alignments . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ have a long n terminal domain which contains and amino acids respectively . the n terminal regions of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ have been predicted to carry a chloroplast transit peptide . the chloroplast localization of _PROTEIN_ has been identified by a _METHOD_ _METHOD_ assay . the localization of _PROTEIN_ in chloroplasts has been visualized in seedlings transformed with the _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ . in addition _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ have a long c terminal tail containing and amino acids respectively suggesting that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ may have a distinct regulatory mechanism . phylogenetic analysis shows that atkeas form a cluster with their e. coli orthologs eckefb/eckefc separating clearly from the clusters of _PROTEIN_ and atchxs with their yeast orthologs . thus atkeas may function distinctly from either _PROTEIN_ or atchxs . phylogenetic analysis was conducted using mega . the alignment is based on the predicted amino acid sequences . evolutionary distances were computed by the neighbor joining method . the scale bar indicates the distance calculated from the multiple alignment . the accession numbers and sources of the na k /h antiporters are as follows eckefb _PROTEIN_ eckefc escherichia coli _PROTEIN_ saccharomyces cerevisiae _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ arabidopsis thaliana . protein organization analysis showed that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are comprised of a soluble n terminal domain a na_h exchange domain and a c terminal ktn domain . the long n terminal domains of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were missed in early gene annotation . the cdna sequences of the short version _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and lacking the n terminal domains but containing the na_h exchange domains have been cloned in yeast by dr. john ward lab . we attempted to clone the full length cdnas of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ genes . since the direct amplification from the arabidopsis cdna preparation was not successful we used a two step strategy . we separated the gene into two pieces by choosing a restriction enzyme site in the middle of the gene the two pieces were cloned separately . we then combined them to get the full length cdna . for _PROTEIN_ an ecori site was chosen to separate the gene into two pieces of and and we successfully cloned the full length cdna . however using the same strategy we did not clone the full length _PROTEIN_ gene . also failed to clone the full length _PROTEIN_ in their study . the activity of the full length _PROTEIN_ was tested in yeast . the full length _PROTEIN_ did not confer resistance to high k and hygromicin b in yeast growth compared with . moreover the full length _PROTEIN_ did not confer resistance to high k at ph relative to . thus the full length _PROTEIN_ is inactive in yeast whereas the is functional suggesting that the n terminal end of _PROTEIN_ may be an autoinhibitory domain controlling the transport activity . the subcellular localization of the full length _PROTEIN_ was detected by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in yeast cells . the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ did not appear at clear cellular structures instead the proteins formed structureless clumps in yeast cells suggesting that the full length _PROTEIN_ did not distribute properly in yeast cells . to test the function of atkeas the coding sequences of _PROTEIN_ were cloned in the yeast _PROTEIN_ vector _PROTEIN_ and introduced into a saccharomyces cerevisiae strain . strain lacks the functional _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ na _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ na k /h antiporter and _LOCATION_ na k /h antiporter . thus it is sensitive to salt and to high k . the transformed yeast was grown on arg phosphate medium with high levels of kcl or nacl . mutants failed to grow in the medium containing mm kcl while the _PROTEIN_ positive strains _PROTEIN_ grew vigorously . _PROTEIN_ of and _PROTEIN_ and recovered tolerance to high k similar to the strains _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ . however the recovery capacities among the atkea family were different . and had the highest effect whereas _PROTEIN_ had no effect . interestingly although atkea genes were well _PROTEIN_ in mutants as detected with _METHOD_ tagged proteins yeast growth was not improved in salt stress suggesting that atkeas do not confer tolerance to salt stress . in addition atkeas did not confer li tolerance . mutants were shown to be sensitive to hygromicin b and and _PROTEIN_ enhanced tolerance to hygromicin b . while all atkea genes conferred resistance to the drug hygromicin b and had the most effect suggesting their roles in endosomal compartments . these results suggest that atkeas specifically facilitate k homeostasis which is dissimilar to _PROTEIN_ . however atkeas are similar to both _PROTEIN_ and atchxs in that all three function in endosomal trafficking . the cdnas of atkeas _PROTEIN_ and were subcloned into the yeast _PROTEIN_ vector _PROTEIN_ and transformed into the mutant _PROTEIN_ . yeast cells were normalized in water to of . aliquots from normalized yeast cultures or fold serial dilutions were spotted onto ap plates containing different concentrations of kcl or ypd plates with different concentrations of nacl or hygromycin b . the strains were grown at for days . atkea genes _PROTEIN_ recovered mutant growth at mm kcl at an external ph of . however the recovery capacity of the atkea family was significantly reduced when ph was dropped to under mm kcl while _PROTEIN_ and were still active under the same conditions . furthermore atkeas completely lost their functions at ph at mm kcl . thus atkeas require a specific ph in mediating k transport in yeast either alkaline or more acidic conditions will affect their functions . atkeas were further tested in the yeast mutant strain generated by deleting in the mutant background . mutants failed to grow at low k at ph while the positive strains grew dynamically . however _PROTEIN_ of atkeas failed to rescue growth at low k at ph while and _PROTEIN_ enhanced yeast growth . these results indicate that atkeas _PROTEIN_ and atchxs may have different modes of action in facilitating k homeostasis . atkeas function at high k at ph while _PROTEIN_ function at high k in acidic environments and atchxs at low k under alkaline conditions . the cdnas of atkeas _PROTEIN_ were subcloned into the yeast _PROTEIN_ vector _PROTEIN_ and transformed into strain _PROTEIN_ . strains were spotted onto ap plates containing kcl at ph or . the cdnas of atkeas _PROTEIN_ and were subcloned into the yeast _PROTEIN_ vector _PROTEIN_ and transformed into strain _PROTEIN_ . strains were spotted onto ap plates containing kcl at ph or . cells were normalized in water to of . aliquots from normalized yeast cultures or fold serial dilutions were spotted onto ap plates . the strains were grown at for days . the transcript abundances of atkea genes were analyzed by rt qpcr using gene specific primers . shoots and roots were isolated from day old wt seedlings growing on _METHOD_ medium . the transcripts of atkea genes were detected in shoots and roots . _PROTEIN_ and had almost equal _PROTEIN_ in shoots and roots _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ however showed a relatively higher _PROTEIN_ in shoots than in roots suggesting their dominant roles in shoots . _PROTEIN_ had the lowest _PROTEIN_ in both shoots and roots . the differential _PROTEIN_ indicates that atkea genes have diversified roles in arabidopsis . fourteen day old arabidopsis seedlings were used . the relative transcript abundance of atkeas in shoots and roots were analyzed by rt qpcr . gene was used as an internal positive control . _LOCATION_ bars represent _PROTEIN_ . since yeast growth assays have shown that atkeas mediate k transport we tested whether atkea _PROTEIN_ was induced by k . interestingly _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was enhanced significantly under low k stress compared to the untreated control . the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ was also enhanced under low k stress but _PROTEIN_ and was not . in contrast gene _PROTEIN_ were significantly reduced for _PROTEIN_ and at high k . the differential _PROTEIN_ in response to low k stress suggests that _PROTEIN_ and are involved in k acquisition under low k conditions in arabidopsis whereas _PROTEIN_ and may have different functions . fourteen day old arabidopsis seedlings were cultured on the _METHOD_ medium or modified _METHOD_ without k or supplemented with or kcl for . gene was used as an internal positive control . the transcript levels of atkeas in the untreated control seedlings were set as . _LOCATION_ bars represent _PROTEIN_ . atkea _PROTEIN_ was further tested under na li and sorbitol stresses . interestingly the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ was strongly induced under mm sorbitol and aba treatments compared to their untreated controls indicating that these two genes were osmotic responsive and were aba dependent . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were also induced by mm nacl which was iso osmotic to mm sorbitol suggesting that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are responsive to osmotic stress other than ionic stress . in addition the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were induced by li stress compared to their untreated controls while no induction was observed for _PROTEIN_ and . arabidopsis seedlings _PROTEIN_ were grown on _METHOD_ agar media for days . col were continued culturing on the fresh _METHOD_ medium without or supplemented with mm nacl mm licl mm sortibol or aba respectively for . col and _PROTEIN_ were continued culturing on the fresh _METHOD_ medium without or supplemented with mm nacl mm sortibol or aba respectively for . gene was used as an internal positive control . the transcript levels of atkeas in the untreated control seedlings were set as . _LOCATION_ bars represent _PROTEIN_ . aba regulation of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was further tested with _PROTEIN_ mutant . the _PROTEIN_ mutant is deficient in aba synthesis but is responsive to exogenously applied aba . under iso osmotic nacl and sorbitol treatments while the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ was induced in wt plants it was not induced in _PROTEIN_ mutants compared to the untreated control . however aba treatments strongly induced the _PROTEIN_ of both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ mutants relative to their untreated controls . these results suggest that the induction of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ by osmotic stress is dependent on aba signaling . the arabidopsis thaliana salt overly sensitive pathway controls ion homeostasis in plants . the sos pathway is composed of snf like kinase _PROTEIN_ and binding protein _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ perceives the ion stress signals and activates _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ in turn activates _PROTEIN_ a _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ na /h antiporter in arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . in an attempt to understand whether atkea _PROTEIN_ is regulated by the sos pathway we tested atkea _PROTEIN_ in sos mutants by rt qpcr . interestingly the _PROTEIN_ of the atkea family in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ mutants was not affected by salt stress compared to their wt plants with salt stress suggesting that atkeas were not controlled by the sos pathway under salt stress . on the contrary _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutants was consistently high compared to either the wt plants with salt stress or their untreated controls . similarly _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutants was high relative to their untreated controls . these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ may be regulated negatively by the sos pathway . or the induction of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ is caused by the osmotic stress generated by the accumulation of salt in sos mutants . arabidopsis seedlings _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were grown on _METHOD_ agar media for fourteen days . seedlings were continued culturing on the fresh _METHOD_ medium without or supplemented with mm nacl respectively for . col and _PROTEIN_ col and _PROTEIN_ col and _PROTEIN_ . gene was used as an internal positive control . the transcript levels of atkeas in the untreated control seedlings were set as . _LOCATION_ bars represent _PROTEIN_ . atkeas fused with _METHOD_ at the c terminals retained resistance to hygromicin b in yeast . in addition the _METHOD_ tagged atkeas distributed properly in the transport activity test strains and shared the same pattern as that in wild type yeast . these results demonstrate that the atkeas tagged with _METHOD_ at their c terminals retained activity in yeast cells . wild type yeast strains harboring _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ atkeas _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ respectively were grown to logarithmic phase in sc ura medium and were stained with dye . the subcellular localizations of the _METHOD_ tagged proteins and _METHOD_ were observed under the laser scanning confocal microscope . bars . in wild type yeast _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ had similar distribution patterns the _METHOD_ signals appeared at a structure at or near the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and a _LOCATION_ structure in the _LOCATION_ . these structures were not overlapped with . the distribution patterns of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were similar to _PROTEIN_ . however _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ shared similar patterns with the _METHOD_ signals appeared at punctate structures . has been determined to be localized to _LOCATION_ indicating that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ is localized to _LOCATION_ in the yeast cells . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ shared similar patterns with _PROTEIN_ the _METHOD_ signals appeared at a _LOCATION_ structure in the _LOCATION_ that was not overlapped with . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signals appeared at both punctate structures and a _LOCATION_ structure in the _LOCATION_ neither structure was overlapped with . these patterns suggest that atkeas have different distributions in yeast cells . we visualized the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ by transient _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis protoplasts . surprisingly _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ appeared on punctate structures in the _LOCATION_ but not in chloroplasts . _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signals were co localized extensively with the _LOCATION_ marker _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ suggesting that _PROTEIN_ is localized to _LOCATION_ . and the transient _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis protoplasts . a cis _LOCATION_ marker _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ were co transformed in arabidopsis protoplasts . _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ image _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ image transmission image overlay of the _METHOD_ and transmission images . bars . and the localization of _PROTEIN_ in root cells of the stably transformed arabidopsis seedlings . _METHOD_ _METHOD_ image overlay of the _METHOD_ and transmission images . images were observed under the laser scanning confocal microscope . bars . to verify the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ we generated stably transformed arabidopsis seedlings _PROTEIN_ cauliflower mosaic virus driven _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . in consistent with the transient _PROTEIN_ assay _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ signals were visualized at the punctate structures within the cells . these punctate structures are the typical structures of _LOCATION_ bodies indicating that _PROTEIN_ is localized to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . however no _METHOD_ signals appeared in chloroplasts . these studies from both yeast and plants suggest that _PROTEIN_ is localized to _LOCATION_ .

_PROTEIN_ was inserted into _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ at ecori xhoi sites to obtain the full length _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . the full length cds of _PROTEIN_ was verified by sequencing . for
