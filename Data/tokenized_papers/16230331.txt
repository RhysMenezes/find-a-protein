the ypt/rab family of small g proteins is important in regulating vesicular transport . rabs hydrolyze _PROTEIN_ very slowly on their own and require _PROTEIN_ activating proteins . here we report the identification and characterization of a rab specific rice gap . strongly stimulated and which are homologs of the mammalian _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ proteins that are essential for _LOCATION_ to _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and trans _LOCATION_ network to pm trafficking respectively . substitution of two invariant arginines within the catalytic domain of oryza sativa _PROTEIN_ activating protein with alanines significantly inhibited its gap activity . in vivo targeting experiments revealed that localizes to the tgn or pre _LOCATION_ compartment . a yeast _PROTEIN_ system demonstrated that wild type facilitates o. sativa dissociation inhibitor catalyzed recycling at an early stage but the and mutants do not . thus _PROTEIN_ hydrolysis is essential for rab recycling . moreover _PROTEIN_ of the mutants in arabidopsis protoplasts inhibited the trafficking of some cargo proteins including the pm localizing h _PROTEIN_ green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and the central _LOCATION_ localizing arabidopsis aleurain like protein _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . the mutants caused these proteins to accumulate at the _LOCATION_ apparatus . surprisingly overproduction relieved the inhibitory effect of the mutants on vesicular trafficking . had no such effect . thus the mutants may inhibit tgn to pm or central _LOCATION_ trafficking because they induce the sequestration of endogenous _PROTEIN_ . we propose that facilitates vesicular trafficking from the tgn to the pm or central _LOCATION_ by both stimulating the _PROTEIN_ activity of and increasing the recycling of inactive .
while several yeast ypt/rab specific gaps and two mammalian rab gaps _PROTEIN_ have been identified rab specific gaps have not yet been isolated from plants . to address this issue we searched the _PROTEIN_ sequence tag files of the o. sativa l. genome and identified several est clones with the characteristics of rab gaps . a genomic dna fragment corresponding to the est clone was then amplified by pcr and used as a hybridization probe to screen a rice zapii cdna library . eighteen positive clones were obtained from this conventional library screening . the clone containing the longest insert was sequenced and its product was denoted o. sativa . consists of an open reading frame of bp that encodes a putative protein of amino acid residues with a calculated molecular _METHOD_ of kda . the alignment of the predicted amino acid sequence of with that of other gap proteins revealed six conserved domains . the central region containing the putative gap domains shares and amino acid sequence identity with arabidopsis thaliana gap an unnamed protein in homo sapiens and saccharomyces cerevisiae respectively . other regions of this protein did not show any significant similarities to those of other proteins . interestingly similarly to previously identified gaps two arginine residues within the motif a and b catalytic domains of were also conserved . since these specific arginine residues are known to be essential for the catalytic activity of the ras rho and rab gaps we predicted that the arginine residues of are required for its catalytic activity . to determine which of the many known osrab homologs specifically interact with in vivo binding assays were performed . moreover the catalytic domain of was characterized by in vitro enzymatic assays . full length fused to the lexa dna binding domain was co _PROTEIN_ with several activation domain fused osrabs namely and . their interactions were assessed by using an x gal filter assay . as shown in table can interact with multiple osrab proteins but interacts especially strongly with and . to determine whether could activate the intrinsic _PROTEIN_ activity of various osrabs and several osrab proteins were _PROTEIN_ and purified by using tagged and glutathione s transferase _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ vectors in escherichia coli respectively . to determine which osrabs are substrates of we compared the enzymatic activity of by using poly cellulose thin layer chromatography to measure the percentage of gdp labeled osrab protein that was converted by into _PROTEIN_ labeled osrab protein . as shown in fig . the intrinsic _PROTEIN_ activities of and were greatly increased in the presence of whereas the other osrabs tested such as and showed only low activities . in addition rapid filtration assays measuring the residual amounts of _PROTEIN_ labeled osrab in vitro confirmed that is highly specific for and but shows low activity for and . to determine the role the two conserved arginine residues within play in its _PROTEIN_ hydrolyzing activity the residues were substituted with alanines . the resulting mutants were named and . the gap activity of these mutants was assessed by using _PROTEIN_ labeled osrab proteins as substrates . since the _PROTEIN_ mutant a _PROTEIN_ fused n terminal deletion mutant has gap activity comparable with wild type and was easier to produce than the bacterially produced full length due to its better yield and solubility it was used as a positive control . as shown in fig . both arginine mutations led to a significant loss of gap activity . when was used all the rab proteins tested showed nearly the same low activity as when the gap was absent . in the case of the mutant severe loss of gap activity was observed especially for . thus the two conserved arginine residues are critical for the catalytic activity of . such apparent inactivation of due to the arginine substitutions led to the question do the mutations affect the physical interaction between and its substrates ? to answer this question we performed a yeast two hybrid interaction assay using the two arginine mutants of and osrab proteins . as shown in table while the arginine mutants interacted more weakly with homologs and than wild type their interaction was still substantial even when a double point mutation was present . thus the gap activity of is not necessarily required for its interaction with its substrate . this has also been observed with _PROTEIN_ to the yeast gap . to define the catalytic site of we constructed various n and c terminal truncated proteins and used them as reaction partners with and in the _PROTEIN_ activity assay . the n terminal amino acids of were dispensable for its _PROTEIN_ hydrolysis activity but deletion of the n terminal amino acids or the c terminal residues rendered inactive . again we investigated whether the lack of gap activity of the truncated proteins was caused by an impaired physical interaction between and or . to do so a yeast two hybrid interaction assay was performed . as shown in table neither the n terminal deletion mutants lacking one of the gap domains nor the c terminal truncation mutant interacted with or . these results suggest that both a c terminal region and the gap domain contribute to the efficient binding of to and . the _PROTEIN_ hydrolysis catalyzed by rab gaps after vesicles fuse with their target _LOCATION_ has been suggested to facilitate the recycling of ypt/rab _PROTEIN_ mediated by _PROTEIN_ . to assess whether serves in the recycling of and from target _LOCATION_ into the _LOCATION_ we used a yeast _PROTEIN_ system . when _PROTEIN_ tagged and genes were _PROTEIN_ under the direction of the _PROTEIN_ promoter in the yeast gdi deletion strain most of the _PROTEIN_ proteins were detected in the _LOCATION_ pool whereas _PROTEIN_ appeared in the _LOCATION_ pool . thus was chosen for this experiment . first _PROTEIN_ tagged was co transformed with hemagglutinin which was previously generated in our laboratory or with . the total proteins in the transformed cells were then ultracentrifuged to divide the _LOCATION_ from the _LOCATION_ fractions and the fractions were subjected to immunoblotting analysis using anti _PROTEIN_ antibody . as shown in fig . a small portion of the _PROTEIN_ proteins was transferred from the _LOCATION_ to the _LOCATION_ with the aid of ha protein . this transfer was not observed when _PROTEIN_ tagged was transformed along with . when _PROTEIN_ tagged was co transformed with both ha and the _LOCATION_ pool of _PROTEIN_ was greatly increased . however only a small portion of _PROTEIN_ tagged appeared in the _LOCATION_ fraction when it was co transformed with ha and one of the mutants . this suggests that _PROTEIN_ activity may be involved in the recycling of _PROTEIN_ especially early in the recycling process prior to the release of by . to confirm the in vivo _PROTEIN_ of the various protein constructs used in this experiment western blot analysis was performed . monoclonal anti and anti ha antibodies were used to detect wild type/mutant and ha respectively . as shown in fig . all the proteins were produced at similar levels . thus the differences in the amount of _PROTEIN_ tagged released into the _LOCATION_ in the presence of and/or wild type/mutant are not due to varying protein _PROTEIN_ levels . to understand the physiological roles that plays in more detail it is necessary to assess its intracellular distribution . to this end we transformed arabidopsis protoplasts with green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ vector only or with _METHOD_ fused and observed the localization of the _METHOD_ signal with a _METHOD_ microscope . as shown in fig . and c while the _METHOD_ signal of the _METHOD_ vector was observed in the _LOCATION_ that of showed a punctate staining pattern which suggests a distribution in the _LOCATION_ and pre _LOCATION_ compartment . we also examined the effect on distribution of brefeldin a which redistributes cis and medial _LOCATION_ proteins to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . to check that bfa has this effect we transformed protoplasts with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ a cis _LOCATION_ marker . bfa treatment caused _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ to be almost completely redistributed to the _LOCATION_ from the _LOCATION_ . in contrast _METHOD_ was not redistributed to the _LOCATION_ by bfa treatment . this suggests that localizes to the trans _LOCATION_ network or pvc but not to the cis or medial _LOCATION_ . to confirm the localization of _METHOD_ to the tgn or pvc _METHOD_ was co transformed with _PROTEIN_ red _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ into arabidopsis protoplasts . _PROTEIN_ is a plant cell marker for the tgn and/or pvc . as shown in fig . most of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signals overlapped with the _METHOD_ signal as indicated by the yellow signals in the merged images . these data confirm that localizes to the tgn and/or pvc . we have shown that the or mutation in motif a or b of the gap domain markedly reduces the _PROTEIN_ activity of . to understand the biological roles of the _PROTEIN_ hydrolyzing activity of we used an in vivo trafficking assay that follows transiently _PROTEIN_ reporter proteins destined for specific organelles in protoplasts . since the data described above suggest probably localizes to the tgn and/or pvc we selected h _PROTEIN_ to act as a reporter protein as it is a cargo protein that is transported to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ through the tgn . h _PROTEIN_ was fused with _METHOD_ and the effect of on its trafficking was examined . when protoplasts were transformed with h _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ alone or together with wild type in most cells h _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was targeted to the pm . however when h _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was co _PROTEIN_ with the trafficking of h _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ to the pm was significantly inhibited . interestingly the co transformation of h _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ with the mutant led to three different h _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ staining patterns with and of the cells showing pm localization _LOCATION_ localization and punctate staining patterns respectively . this indicates that the overproduction of mutant interferes with the transport of h _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ to the pm causing this cargo protein to accumulate at other sites . the mutant had a similar effect on h _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ localization as shown in fig . . to confirm that the wild type and mutant proteins were produced in the transformed protoplasts the total protoplast proteins were investigated by western blot analysis using a monoclonal anti antibody . as shown in fig . the antibody detected a protein band at kda which is the expected size of and its mutants . thus _PROTEIN_ hydrolysis is required for the trafficking process that is induced by the rab protein . h _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ moves through the _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ via the secretory pathway if this pathway is blocked h _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ may accumulate in these organelles . to test this possibility we co transformed protoplasts with h _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and the _LOCATION_ marker _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . as shown in fig . in the presence of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signal appeared as a punctate staining pattern and clearly overlapped with that of h _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . this suggests that causes h _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ to accumulate at the _LOCATION_ apparatus . in addition to confirm that overproduced alters the localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ we transformed protoplasts with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and the _LOCATION_ marker protein _METHOD_ bip in the presence or absence of . as shown in fig . and c _METHOD_ bip and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ localized at the _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ apparatus respectively _PROTEIN_ of whether overproduced was _PROTEIN_ . to define where _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was distributed the localization of these two cargo proteins was investigated again in the presence or absence of bfa . in the absence of bfa as shown in fig . and c the two proteins moved separately but in the presence of bfa their staining images overlapped completely . all these data indicate that does not affect the trafficking of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ can be relocated by bfa to the _LOCATION_ along a retrograde pathway . the latter observation means that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ localizes to the _LOCATION_ apparatus . the effect of the two overproduced mutants on another pm protein _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ of arabidopsis was also examined . as shown in fig . when _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was produced in protoplasts without exogenously supplied it was transported in an anterograde way from the _LOCATION_ to the pm . interestingly the trafficking of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was inhibited when either of the two arginine mutants of was overproduced resulting in the accumulation of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ at the _LOCATION_ . this was very similar to the effect of the mutants on h _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ distribution suggesting that the two arginine mutants of have the same inhibitory effect on the trafficking of these two pm proteins . since the two arginine mutants of inhibited tgn to pm trafficking and localizes to the tgn or pvc we asked whether these mutants can also influence tgn to central _LOCATION_ trafficking . to answer this arabidopsis aleurain like protein _PROTEIN_ was used as a central _LOCATION_ marker protein . arabidopsis protoplasts _PROTEIN_ an mutant were transformed with _METHOD_ fused _PROTEIN_ and the _METHOD_ patterns were observed . when _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ alone was _PROTEIN_ the majority of the transformed protoplasts showed _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ patterns a minor portion showed an _LOCATION_ pattern . in contrast the arginine mutants of markedly reduced the _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ pattern of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ increased the frequency of the _LOCATION_ pattern and induced the appearance of a new punctate pattern . to define the punctuate pattern of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ it was co transformed with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in protoplasts _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signal overlapped with the punctate staining of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ suggesting that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ had accumulated at the _LOCATION_ due to the inhibitory effect of the mutant . to demonstrate clearly the inhibitory effect of two arginine mutants on tgn to central _LOCATION_ trafficking we performed western blot analysis using the _METHOD_ antibody . _LOCATION_ proteins are known to be subjected to partial proteolysis during _LOCATION_ trafficking and/or in the _LOCATION_ . as shown in fig . the kda band intensity of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was reduced when this marker protein was co _PROTEIN_ with two arginine mutants in protoplasts . this was consistent with the results of analyses of the aforementioned staining pattern and trafficking efficiency . in addition we examined the effect of the mutants using another _LOCATION_ marker sporamin . when spo _METHOD_ was co transformed with in protoplasts the trafficking of spo _METHOD_ to the central _LOCATION_ was inhibited to levels similar to _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . these observations together suggest that may be involved in the trafficking of central _LOCATION_ proteins as well as pm proteins via the tgn . several observations together suggest that overproduction of the arginine mutants results in the sequestration of endogenous rab proteins especially _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ thereby significantly inhibiting the tgn to pm or central _LOCATION_ trafficking . first the two mutants continue to interact with their substrates and inhibit the recycling of . secondly mammalian _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are known to traffick from the tgn to the pm and from the _LOCATION_ to the pm respectively . to determine whether overproducing and could overcome the mutant mediated inhibition of tgn to pm or central _LOCATION_ trafficking the two cargo proteins h _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were co transformed with ha or ha into protoplasts _PROTEIN_ . as shown in fig . overproducing ha relieved the inhibitory effect of on the trafficking of the two pm cargo proteins however ha did not . the same experiment was then used to assess whether overproducing and could overcome the mutant mediated inhibition of tgn to central _LOCATION_ trafficking . for this the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein was used . interestingly as with h _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ overproduced relieved the inhibitory effect of on the trafficking of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ whereas did not . to confirm that ha and ha were properly _PROTEIN_ western blot analysis was performed by using anti ha antibody . as shown in fig . d the ha antibody detected a kda protein band which is the expected size of ha and ha . these observations together suggest that overproducing the mutants interferes with the recycling of endogenous _PROTEIN_ in protoplasts by sequestering it . this blocks the trafficking of proteins from the tgn to the pm or the central _LOCATION_ .
arabidopsis thaliana was grown on plates containing murashige and skoog medium at in a growth chamber under the conditions of relative humidity and a h h dark cycle . a probe to detect a rab gap cdna in rice was prepared by pcr amplification using primers designed on the basis of a nucleotide sequence in the est database . pcr amplification and library screening were performed as described previously . in addition the rab _PROTEIN_ cdna was also isolated by the same procedure the mutant gaps and were constructed by pcr using the following primers ccatgttctggcgaaagaggtctg and cagacctctttcgccagaacatgg and _PROTEIN_ and tgatctatctgtcgccaccacatc respectively . the epitope tag was added to the n terminus of and its mutants and bamhi/xhoi digestion fragments of each sequence were ligated into the same restriction sites of the vector . xbai/xhoi fragments from the ligated constructs encoding and were subsequently isolated and their sequences were confirmed by nucleotide sequencing . the constructs were then placed under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus promoter in a puc vector . both _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ fused constructs were made by placing the coding region in frame at the c terminus of the _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ coding regions after removing their termination codons . to _PROTEIN_ the gene in yeast its orf was first placed under the control of the _PROTEIN_ promoter in which contains _PROTEIN_ . the yeast cells which are denoted as _PROTEIN_ and were obtained from euroscarfe were co transformed with _PROTEIN_ tagged ha and and its mutants . transformants were cultured in minimal _PROTEIN_ medium at for h and then transferred and cultured in new galactose medium at for h. the total cell lysates were ultracentrifuged at for min to obtain _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ fractions . each sample was analyzed by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and immunobloting . _PROTEIN_ hydrolysis assays were performed in two ways . one involved the use of pei cellulose tlc plates and was carried out according to the method of seo et al . with a slight modification . briefly the reaction was performed at in a buffer containing mm ph mm edta mm dithiothreitol mm mm _PROTEIN_ nm _PROTEIN_ mm _PROTEIN_ and of osrab proteins with or without of . aliquots of were sampled at appropriate time intervals and the same volume of m edta was added to stop the reaction . samples were spotted onto pei cellulose tlc plates which were then developed in m ph solution . after drying the plate was exposed to an x ray film . the other method involved the rapid filtration assay . the rest of the procedure was exactly as described above except that _PROTEIN_ labeled osrab proteins were used instead of _PROTEIN_ labeled proteins . transient _PROTEIN_ of the _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ fused constructs in arabidopsis protoplasts was performed according to the method described by jin et al . . briefly recombinant plasmids were introduced by polyethylene glycol mediated transformation into arabidopsis protoplasts that had been prepared from leaf tissues . _PROTEIN_ of the fusion constructs was monitored at various times after transformation by observation under a _METHOD_ microscope . to prepare cell extracts from protoplasts transformed protoplasts were lysed by repeated freeze thaw cycles and then centrifuged at for min at in a microcentrifuge to remove cell debris . the total protein extracts were separated on a _PROTEIN_ polyacrylamide gel electroblotted onto a nitrocellulose _LOCATION_ using a semi dry electro blotter and incubated with each of the indicated antibodies . a hybrid hunter version d kit was used for the two hybrid assay . full length point mutants or partial coding regions of were fused to the _PROTEIN_ vector and various osrab protein coding genes and isolated by reverse transcription pcr from a rice cdna library were cloned into the plasmid containing the activation domain . interactions among fusion proteins were investigated by co transforming appropriate plasmids into the yeast reporter strain . transformed yeast cells bearing these two plasmids were selected on synthetic complete medium lacking tryptophan uracil leucine lysine and histidine or on sc trp ura leu lys medium lacking histidine only as a control . histidine positive colonies were tested further for galactosidase activity according to the manufacturer s protocol . the growth of blue colonies in histidine deficient medium indicates a positive interaction . the positive yeast colonies were isolated and identified . plasmids from these colonies were recovered and the presence of the insert sequences was reconfirmed by restriction analysis and sequencing .
