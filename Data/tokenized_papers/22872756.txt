double fertilization of the egg cell and the central cell by two sperm cells resulting in the formation of the embryo and the endosperm respectively is a defining characteristic of flowering plants . the arabidopsis thaliana female gametophytic mutant glauce can exhibit embryo development without any endosperm . here we show that in glc mutant embryo sacs one sperm cell successfully fuses with the egg cell but the second sperm cell fails to fuse with the central cell resulting in single fertilization . complementation studies using genes from the glc deletion interval identified an unusual genomic locus having homology to bahd acyl transferases with dual transcription units and alternative splicing that could rescue the sterility defect of glc . _PROTEIN_ of these transcripts appears restricted to the central cell and _PROTEIN_ within the central cell is sufficient to restore fertility . we conclude that the central cell actively promotes its own fertilization by the sperm cell through a signaling mechanism involving products of _GENE_ . successful fertilization of the egg cell is not blocked in the glc mutant suggesting that evolution of double fertilization in flowering plants involved acquisition of specific functions by the central cell to enable its role as a second female gamete .
upon fertilization glc ovules were found to exhibit a remarkable phenotype in which the embryo develops without any endosperm . to further characterize the glc phenotype and determine why no endosperm developed the process of the double fertilization was further studied in glc mutant embryo sacs . first we checked for any possible effects of the glc mutation on pollen tube guidance by pollinating emasculated wild type and glc/glc flowers with pollen of the gus _PROTEIN_ pollen specific marker . pistils were sampled and h _PROTEIN_ and gus presence was detected at the micropylar end of the embryo sac . at h after pollination a significant difference between the wild type and glc was observed where pollen tubes reached over of wild type ovules and burst into their sc while in glc/glc pistils pollen tubes reached only of the ovules . considering the heterozygous genetic background of glc/glc in which half of its embryo sacs are normal most of the pollen tube arrivals detected at this time point were likely to be at wild type ovules . this implies that of the glc mutant ovules did not yet receive any pollen tubes . by hap however of the ovules in glc/glc pistils received a pollen tube a level that does not differ statistically from wild type plants . therefore we conclude that the glc mutation results in an initial delay in pollen tube arrival possibly as a consequence of weaker pollen tube attraction . nonpollinated mature glc/glc pistils usually contain to normal looking ovules indistinguishable from one another . however hap the ovule population segregates into approximately two even groups big normal looking ovules and small retarded ones . this delineation persists into the mature silique in which the normal ovules go through successful seed formation whereas the small ovules abort resulting in the semisterile phenotype of glc/glc plants . this observation also _METHOD_ that the small ovules indeed harbor nonfunctional female gametophytes . to elucidate the fertilization process in glc embryo sacs we pollinated glc/glc heterozygotes with pollen carrying the sperm cell specific histone fused to the red _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ as a marker for the sperm cell . knowing that by hap the pollen tube burst occurred in most of the glc ovules we determined the fate of the discharged sperm cells in these ovules at hap or _PROTEIN_ . at that time the presence of sperm cells was detected in only wild type ovules out of the examined whereas in the glc/glc mutant sperm cells were detected in ovules out of . bearing in _PROTEIN_ the heterozygous genetic background of the glc/glc mutant the actual percentage of the sperm containing glc ovules was indicating disturbance of the fertilization process in the mutated ovules . moreover of the sperm containing ovules observed in glc/glc pistils contained only single sperm cells which we never observed in wild type pistils . to further characterize the persistent single sperm cells observed in the embryo sacs of glc/glc pistils we introduced the following embryo sac cell specific green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ marker lines into the glc/glc mutant background and . emasculated flowers of progenies from these crosses were pollinated with _METHOD_ pollen and hap or _PROTEIN_ glc/glc pistils were sampled . based on their small size glc ovules were dissected out and the location of the sperm _LOCATION_ in their embryo sacs at the time of dissection was observed using the _METHOD_ markers . prior to sperm discharge the scs were round shaped and turgid in all the observed cases . scs observed after sperm discharge exhibited shape changes suggesting that at this stage the glc sc might be undergoing degeneration . the delay in pollen tube arrival and burst into glc ovules followed by longer persistence of the discharged sperm cells in the glc embryo sac micropylar end even at hap or _PROTEIN_ led to delayed ec fertilization in glc ovules . as reported by citation the _METHOD_ reporter which marks the ec persists further into postfertilization stages from the zygote to early stages of embryo development . the two ovules shown in figure both _PROTEIN_ the marker . the right ovule had a well developed embryo and several endosperm _LOCATION_ indicated by traces of _METHOD_ whereas in the smaller ovule the ec had not yet been fertilized as indicated by the _PROTEIN_ that it had not yet adopted the typical compacted structure of the zygote . the percentage of unfertilized glc ovules at hap was while in wild type ovules fertilization had already occurred in of the ecs based on using the marker to monitor their change into the characteristic shape of the zygote . since fertilization of the ec in glc ovules was delayed a lag phase in development of glc embryos as compared with wild type embryos was expected and indeed observed previously . the lack of support of the nourishing endosperm in glc ovules probably enhanced the retarded development of glc embryos when reaching the preglobular stage and these embryos eventually abort . after sperm cell release embryo formation could be detected in the embryo sac of the small defective ovules but the _METHOD_ signal corresponding to a single sperm _LOCATION_ persisted in the vicinity of the egg apparatus . once the sperm _LOCATION_ fused with the ec _LOCATION_ the _METHOD_ was rapidly removed . this removal is thought to play a role in remodeling of the zygotic chromatin . in glc embryo sacs ec fertilization is performed successfully however glc embryos were observed to exhibit some inhibition of paternal gene _PROTEIN_ . these observations raised the possibility that the normal rapid removal of might be disrupted in the glc zygote . in that case the persisting _METHOD_ signal would colocalize with the ec _LOCATION_ in the postfertilization stages rather than disappear as in the wild type . observations of glc _PROTEIN_ zygotes and embryos clearly showed that the _METHOD_ and the _METHOD_ signals did not overlap indicating exclusion of this sperm cell signal from the ec . therefore the persisting _METHOD_ signal after ec fertilization must arise from the second sperm cell which would normally have fertilized the cc and is not due to defective removal of the from the sperm _LOCATION_ fertilizing the ec _LOCATION_ . in of the observation samples the second sperm _LOCATION_ was associated with the micropylar end of the _PROTEIN_ zygote/embryo . we then examined the cause underlying the persistence of this second sperm cell _LOCATION_ . this could arise from either a failure of fusion of the sperm cell with the cc or a failure of the migration of the sperm _LOCATION_ after entry into the cc cytoplasm and the consequent failure of karyogamy _LOCATION_ . therefore glc/glc plants carrying the marker _METHOD_ in which _METHOD_ was _PROTEIN_ specifically in the cc were pollinated with _METHOD_ pollen and observed . observations of fertilized glc embryo sacs _PROTEIN_ the cc marker showed in of the cases that the localization of the persisting _METHOD_ signal was clearly external to the cc . we conclude that in the glc mutant failure of the second fertilization event is due to failure of fusion of the sperm cell and the cc leading to the absence of endosperm formation from the glc cc in these ovules . however in of the observations we noted that the sperm _METHOD_ and the cc _METHOD_ signals did overlap . the latter observations were performed at hap or _PROTEIN_ when the scs had already degenerated and their space was occupied by the cytoplasmic protrusions of the cc at the micropylar end which normally develops into the micropylar endosperm after fertilization . the expansion of the cc into this zone might lead to the cc surrounding the remaining sperm cell resulting in the observed overlap of signals even in the absence of plasmogamy . however we also can not rule out that in some cases plasmogamy was successful but that the subsequent migration of the sperm _LOCATION_ to the cc _LOCATION_ was disrupted . the latter interpretation is partially supported by previous observations that a low rate of two to eight endosperm _LOCATION_ was observed in glc ovules . it is possible that in these cases there was successful cell fusion but no karyogamy which could trigger autonomous endosperm formation . in a study of fertilization by pollen from the cdka mutant it has been shown that initiation of autonomous endosperm by cc _LOCATION_ divisions was correlated with the failure of karyogamy of the cc and sperm _LOCATION_ although in that study the migration of the sperm cell _LOCATION_ after entry into the cc appeared to be unaffected in the mutants . to understand the molecular basis for the failure of cc fertilization in glc mutants we embarked on the molecular isolation of the gene responsible . a segment of kb was reported to be deleted from chromosome in the glc mutant . to examine the possibility that the glc phenotype is caused by loss of function of a single gene we obtained and screened knockout lines in out of the annotated genes residing in the deletion . however we did not observe the glc phenotype in any of these gene knockouts . we then attempted to narrow down the region responsible for the glc phenotype using complementation by bac clones that overlie the deletion interval . mutant heterozygotes were transformed with the following bac clones that together covered the deleted region and . seeds were collected from successful glc bac transformed plants and were plated on plates with kanamycin to determine the kan resistance/kan sensitivity segregation ratio to assay whether the bacs could rescue the glc defect . the kanr/kans segregation ratio in glc heterozygotes was in a range typical of gametophytic mutations . this ratio increased to and in glc plants transformed with the bacs and respectively in a statistically significant fashion . the kanr/kans segregation ratio remained unchanged when glc plants were transformed with bac . the failure of this bac to complement glc is consistent with the absence of the glc phenotype in the reported deletion mutant hot whose entire deletion overlaps of . since the bacs and are overlapping we concluded that one or more genes residing in this kb region of overlap must play a role in the glc phenotype . _PROTEIN_ data in female reproductive tissues of the genes residing in the overlapping region of and were derived from the bio array resource microarray database and showed that two small neighboring unknown transferases _GENE_ and _GENE_ were the only ones to be highly and specifically _PROTEIN_ in pistils of mature nonpollinated flower _PROTEIN_ . more importantly the recently published arabidopsis female gametophyte transcriptome enabled us to extract specific _PROTEIN_ profiles of these genes in the different embryo sac cell types ec cc and sc . it was found that most of the genes residing in the overlapping region had a low _PROTEIN_ in all three cell types except for _GENE_ and _GENE_ which were highly _PROTEIN_ in the cc . furthermore _PROTEIN_ of these two genes could not be found in the recently published seed development transcriptome either in the early endosperm or other seed developmental stages thereby restricting the role of these genes to earlier stages . based on this information these two genes were considered good candidates for being affected in the glc mutant . both genes were cloned into the binary vector and transformed into glc heterozyotes . seeds were collected from transformed glc/glc plants and were plated on plates with kan to assess their kanr/kans transmission ratio . both genes successfully complemented the kanr/kans segregation ratio distortion typical of glc/glc plants and rescued glc/glc semisterility in mature siliques . therefore we concluded that both genes can complement the fertility function that is disrupted in glc mutants . it is important to note that the large scale screen of t dna knockout lines mentioned above included knockouts of _GENE_ and _GENE_ corresponding to t dna insertion lines and respectively . in both cases the insertions are in the middle of coding exons however both lines exhibited a normal seed set and individuals homozygous for the insertion could be isolated suggesting that and are genetically redundant . furthermore no homozygous glc plants could be isolated among the rescued glc transformants implying that another gene or genes within the deletion are required to restore viability in glc homozygotes . for example loss of function mutants of the gene _PROTEIN_ which lies within the glc deletion interval is known to result in seedling lethality when homozygous . another possible reason for not obtaining glc/glc homozygotes might arise from the kb segment duplicated elsewhere in the genome potentially affecting the _PROTEIN_ of other unknown genes . as mentioned above _GENE_ and _GENE_ were previously annotated as two separate genes that encode two small transferases of unknown function . however we noticed that blast searches of each one aligns with the n terminal and c terminal regions respectively of most known acyl transferase proteins of the bahd superfamily . these enzymes use acyl coa and are considered to be involved in secondary metabolism which has been demonstrated for some of the bahd members . in arabidopsis at least bahd members were identified . at the amino acid level the bahds are highly divergent showing to similarity yet they share several highly conserved regions specifically the hxxxd motif that is located near the enzyme s catalytic center and the c terminal dfgwg motif . manipulation of these motifs has been shown to result in a significant reduction in enzymatic activity . indeed the _PROTEIN_ version of the arabidopsis genome has reannotated these as a single gene _GENE_ containing two small exons separated by one long intron . nevertheless the known full length cdnas for this gene consist mostly of its shorter variants with the expected untranslated regions for two separate transcripts rather than truncated ests of the full gene . this indicates that the truncated variants are transcribed and may actually be more abundant than the combined sequence therefore supporting the former annotation . currently a combination of both annotations is presented by . interestingly embryo sac specific gene _PROTEIN_ profiles of arabidopsis bahd members in general showed very low _PROTEIN_ except for _GENE_ and _GENE_ which were the only ones highly _PROTEIN_ in the cc . these data are consistent with a specific role for these two genes in the cc of the mature unfertilized ovule . in line with the former annotation and were recently _PROTEIN_ as partial polypeptides that are lacking the two essential hxxxd and dfgwg motifs associated with functional bahd genes and were therefore excluded from a large scale phylogenetic analysis of bahds performed in arabidopsis and poplar . nevertheless we could successfully identify both motifs in the middle and the c terminal end of _GENE_ and in the n terminal and c terminal ends of . it is important to note that we could detect several bahd members from a variety of plants in which the motif diverged from the canonical conserved dfgwg motif . in the case of _GENE_ it is represented by eypwg . a very similar change _PROTEIN_ occurred in the poplar bahd protein which groups into the same clade as _GENE_ . to determine if the combined sequence is capable of rescuing glc and to rule out the possibility that the overlapping intergenic region shared by the genomic dna pieces of and is responsible for the rescue of glc rna was isolated from wild type pistils and cdnas were synthesized . all three _METHOD_ discussed above were identified and successfully cloned thus confirming the dual nature of _GENE_ _PROTEIN_ . the complicated transcriptional structure of this locus made it difficult to pinpoint the native promoters . since the embryo sac _PROTEIN_ profiles of this gene were high in the cc we chose to use the reported cc specific promoter for _PROTEIN_ of the cloned cdnas in the cc . the promoter was cloned and fused to a gus reporter and indeed showed high and specific gus activity in the cc . the promoter was then swapped in place of the original promoter of the binary vector into which the above cdnas had been cloned . seeds were collected from successfully transformed glc plants and plated onto plates containing kan to assess the kanr/kans segregation ratio . all three _METHOD_ successfully rescued the distorted kanr/kans segregations ratio typical of glc/glc plants indicating that both the combined sequence and its two truncated variants can functionally complement glc . to find out if the glc effect on pollen tube guidance was rescued as well emasculated flowers form glc/glc plants transformed with were pollinated with pollen of _PROTEIN_ the gus pollen specific marker . at hap of the ovules were reached by pollen tubes that burst at the micropylar end which is not significantly different from wild type ovules at the same time . interestingly even though and are not identical the amino acid alignment of both shows regions of similarity . again no homozygous glc plants could be isolated among the rescued glc transformants suggesting that another gene within the deletion might be required for viability when homozygous . most bahds are known to be localized to the cytoplasm but functions of this family have not been characterized in detail . since the phenotype we describe suggests a communication problem between the cc and the externally located sperm cell we explored the possibility of _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ localization . alternately a clear _LOCATION_ localization using the and constructs would have suggested a _LOCATION_ role such as involvement in gene _PROTEIN_ through acetylation . _METHOD_ translational fusions of the complete protein and its _METHOD_ were constructed the different cdnas were cloned into n and c terminal _METHOD_ translational fusion constructs driven by the cc specific promoter . since the constructs used were driven by the promoter we were expecting to observe _METHOD_ in the cc . this was indeed the case for c terminal n terminal and n terminal constructs . in these cases the _METHOD_ was located in the cytoplasm and was highly concentrated in the _LOCATION_ only in the construct . the _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ signal in the and constructs was considerably reduced compared with the cytoplasm suggesting that the fusions might be excluded from the _LOCATION_ . however due to the low signal that is detectable with and it is possible that the fusion proteins are still able to enter the _LOCATION_ . to examine whether the _METHOD_ translational fusions are functional they were introduced into the glc mutant background . since direct transformation of the constructs into glc plants was not possible glc/glc served as a pollen donor and was crossed to pistils of wild type transformants _PROTEIN_ the c terminal and the n terminal constructs mentioned above . heterozygous plants that were genotyped as glc/glc and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in their ovules were isolated and their seed set was assessed . partial but significant rescue of the glc/glc semisterility phenotype was observed for both the c terminal and the n terminal constructs thus indicating that both _METHOD_ fusions are biologically functional . the unusual gene organization resulting in the and transcripts raised the question of where the promoters might reside for initiation of these transcripts . to characterize their putative promoters genomic dna from two intergenic regions was cloned . the first isolated fragment from here on called the promoter resides between _GENE_ and the first exon of _GENE_ . the second isolated fragment that we call the promoter is the long intron of that corresponds to the intergenic region between the and loci . both fragments were successfully cloned into the binary vector and their gus _PROTEIN_ was determined in mature nonfertilized ovules of wild type transformants . in both cases gus activity could be detected in the embryo sac . with the promoter strong gus activity was observed throughout the embryo sac whereas the gus activity driven by the promoter was weaker and _PROTEIN_ restricted to the sc . in both cases strong gus activity was also observed in sporophytic tissues such as the funiculus and the placenta for the promoter and the micropylar end of integuments and placenta for the promoter . these observations differ from the specific cc _PROTEIN_ of the _GENE_ _METHOD_ deduced from the microarray profiles . however it is very likely that in addition to the end promoter sequences used the differential gene _PROTEIN_ found in the embryo sac cell types requires enhancer activity of elements located up/downstream of the gene particularly in the case of the gene . since the isolated putative promoters were likely incomplete and were investigated out of their native chromosomal context we were not expecting to observe an exact match between the gus activity and the actual _PROTEIN_ pattern of these genes . still both dna fragments were found to have promoter activity in the embryo sac . importantly the gus activity resulting from the promoter suggests that the intron between the two exons of can act as a promoter for the gene and therefore can explain the presence of the transcripts in wild type plants .
