dna damage responses have evolved to sense and react to dna damage the induction of dna repair _METHOD_ can lead to genomic restoration or if the damaged dna can not be adequately repaired to the execution of a cell death program . in this work we investigated the role of an arabidopsis protein _PROTEIN_ which is highly similar to the human protein it is induced by ultraviolet b radiation and participates in programmed cell death in the uv b dna damage response . transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ fused to _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein indicate that _PROTEIN_ is localized both in the _LOCATION_ and the _LOCATION_ . by use of mutants we here demonstrate that these plants have an altered antioxidant metabolism and accumulate higher levels of dna damage after uv b exposure similar to levels in _PROTEIN_ rna interference transgenic lines with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ of acetyltransferases from the myst family . by coimmunoprecipitation and pull down assays we provide evidence that _PROTEIN_ interacts with ham proteins suggesting that both proteins participate in the same pathway of dna damage responses . plants overexpressing _PROTEIN_ show less dna damage but more cell death in root tips upon uv b exposure . finally we here show that _PROTEIN_ also participates in age induced programmed cell death . together the data presented here demonstrate that _PROTEIN_ plays an important role during dna damage responses induced by uv b radiation in arabidopsis and also participates in programmed cell death _METHOD_ .
in plants has only been studied in rice . to find the arabidopsis homolog of and we searched for a putative _PROTEIN_ in the national center for biotechnology information using protein sequence homology _METHOD_ . this resulted in the identification of one putative _PROTEIN_ protein that shows and amino acid identity with and respectively . _PROTEIN_ has a predicted double stranded dna binding domain of amino acids which is present in all the proteins identified that extends from amino acids to and spans almost the entire coding region it is predicted to bind about nucleotides in dna . the _PROTEIN_ coding sequence shows three alternative splicing variants which encode putative proteins of and amino acids . the and amino acid variants only differ in one amino acid at position while the amino acid variant results from a change in the reading frame after position . at the dna sequence level the differences between the three variants occur in exon exon junctions . the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ alternative splicing variants was analyzed in several tissues by quantitative reverse transcription pcr . transcripts corresponding to the amino acid protein were the most abundant in all the analyzed tissues . this isoform is also the most similar to all described from other _METHOD_ including those from rice and humans therefore all the following experiments were conducted with this variant . in humans regulates the switch of the cell response from dna repair to pcd after uv induced dna damage . in addition as reported by citation is uv b regulated . thus it is possible that _PROTEIN_ may have a role during dna damage responses . to investigate if this is the case we focused on the potential role of _PROTEIN_ in the uv b induced dna damage response pathway . we first analyzed its _PROTEIN_ in week old arabidopsis plants exposed under uv b lamps for h in growth chamber conditions . immediately after the treatment rosettes were collected for rna extraction . _PROTEIN_ transcript levels increased significantly after uv b irradiation . the presence of a putative dna binding domain in the _PROTEIN_ structure and also the _PROTEIN_ algorithm predict that this protein could be localized to the _LOCATION_ . moreover is translocated to the _LOCATION_ after exposure to uv radiation where it interacts with _PROTEIN_ promoting dna repair . therefore we generated arabidopsis transgenic plants that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ as a fusion protein to the n terminal domain of _METHOD_ driven by the cauliflower mosaic virus promoter _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . plants were grown d under control conditions in the absence of uv b . a subset was irradiated with uv b while a group was kept in the growth chamber as a control . both in control and uv b exposed plants _METHOD_ signal indicated that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein is localized both in the _LOCATION_ and in the _LOCATION_ . in arabidopsis transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ driven by the promoter _METHOD_ the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was detected only in the _LOCATION_ thus the _METHOD_ signal in the _LOCATION_ shown in figure is due to _PROTEIN_ localization in this organelle . absorption of uv b by dna induces the formation of covalent bonds between adjacent pyrimidines giving rise to _PROTEIN_ and to a lesser extent pyrimidine pyrimidone photoproducts . we have demonstrated previously that arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ and/or _PROTEIN_ deficient plants accumulate more _PROTEIN_ than wild type plants after uv b exposure . thus we analyzed _PROTEIN_ accumulation after uv b exposure in two _PROTEIN_ knockdown mutant transfer dna insertion lines which have and fold _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ transcripts levels respectively compared with wild type plants . supplemental figure shows that has a t dna insertion in the promoter while has a t dna insertion in the untranslated region . arabidopsis wild type and mutant plants were grown in a growth chamber in the absence of uv b for weeks . plants were then exposed for h to uv b . as a control different plants were irradiated with the same lamps covered with polyester plastic that absorbs uv b . leaf samples from control and uv b treated plants were collected immediately after the end of the treatment . dna was extracted from and wild type plants and _PROTEIN_ accumulation was analyzed using monoclonal antibodies specifically raised against them . a comparison of _PROTEIN_ accumulation in samples from wild type and mutant plants after the uv b treatment and in control conditions in the absence of uv b is shown in figure . in the absence of uv b the steady state levels of _PROTEIN_ in wild type and mutant plants were similar . nevertheless after a h uv b exposure more unrepaired lesions accumulated in the mutants than in wild type plants . to analyze if the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ of affects the _PROTEIN_ of dna repair enzymes _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ and _PROTEIN_ transcript levels were analyzed by qrt pcr in wild type and mutant plants . after a h uv b treatment under light conditions _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ gene _PROTEIN_ was induced in both the wild type and mutants but the increase of both transcripts was significantly lower in mutants than in wild type plants . moreover while _PROTEIN_ transcript levels were increased by uv b in wild type plants uv b induction of was impaired in mutants . therefore the higher accumulation of _PROTEIN_ in mutants by uv b radiation can be due to lower _PROTEIN_ levels of dna repair enzymes in uv b exposed plants . thus our results demonstrate that in the mutants dna repair _METHOD_ are impaired . reactive oxygen species are not only toxic by products of aerobic metabolism but also function as signaling agents acting for example as important modulators of plant pcd . therefore we further evaluated the antioxidant metabolism in mutants both under control conditions and after uv b exposure . we first analyzed the activity of enzymes that participate in ros detoxification glutathione reductase _PROTEIN_ catalase peroxidase ascorbate peroxidase and superoxide dismutase . under control conditions in the absence of uv b the activities of all five enzymes were higher in than in wild type plants . interestingly after a h uv b treatment at w pod and _PROTEIN_ activities increased in wild type plants showing similar levels to those detected in mutants under control conditions . on the other hand the activities of the three other detoxifying enzymes did not increase in wild type plants by uv b but were significantly higher in than in wild type plants under both control and uv b conditions . this was also observed when plants were exposed to times lower uv b intensities . consistently mutants also showed higher levels of antioxidant molecules such as polyphenols flavonoids ascorbic acid and reduced glutathione in comparison with wild type plants in control conditions . after low intensity uv b exposure the levels of ascorbic acid and reduced glutathione were similar in the wild type and mutants while uv b induced significant and higher accumulation of polyphenols and flavonoids in the mutants in comparison with wild type plants . the overall antioxidant state of control and uv b irradiated plants was assayed using the ferric reducing ability of _LOCATION_ assay which is based on the ability of a certain biological sample to reduce ferric to ferrous ions . our results show that the antioxidant capacity _PROTEIN_ is higher in mutants than in wild type plants in control conditions and after uv b exposure . finally we analyzed direct ros formation after a h uv b treatment at w . both mutants exhibit lower levels of ros than wild type plants in correlation with the increased antioxidant capacity of the mutants shown in figures and . in summary our results show that a deficiency in the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ strongly affects the redox metabolism in arabidopsis cells . the human homolog of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ and its hat activity is regulated by under uv b conditions . similar to arabidopsis plants _PROTEIN_ rnai plants showed an increased _PROTEIN_ accumulation after a h uv b treatment . therefore with the aim to elucidate if _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are in the same uv b response pathway mutants were crossed with _PROTEIN_ rnai transgenic plants . progeny with reduced levels of the three transcripts _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ from several independent plants were obtained . four week old triple knockdown plants together with single _PROTEIN_ rnai and wild type plants were irradiated with uv b for h and _PROTEIN_ accumulation was assayed in samples collected at the end of the treatment . figure shows that dna damage in the triple knockdown plants was similar to that of single mutants and the _PROTEIN_ rnai transgenic plants suggesting that _PROTEIN_ and atham proteins participate in the same uv b induced dna damage response pathway . moreover to further analyze if _PROTEIN_ interacts in vivo with _PROTEIN_ as reported in humans we carried out coimmunoprecipitation experiments using _LOCATION_ lysates from _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgenic plants and anti _METHOD_ antibodies . the immunoprecipitate was resolved by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and analyzed by western blot using commercial antibodies against human _PROTEIN_ protein these antibodies were shown previously to recognize atham proteins . the analysis revealed that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ coimmunoprecipitated with _PROTEIN_ demonstrating that ham proteins and interact physically in the _LOCATION_ . this interaction also was observed when pull down experiments were carried out . for these experiments _LOCATION_ extracts from _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgenic plants were incubated with purified recombinant glutathione s transferase _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ which is similar in amino acid sequence to _PROTEIN_ and this extract was then immunoprecipitated using anti _PROTEIN_ antibodies . as controls _PROTEIN_ protein or _LOCATION_ extracts from wild type plants were used . coimmunoprecipitates were analyzed by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ followed by western blot using anti _METHOD_ antibodies showing that _PROTEIN_ coimmunoprecipitates with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . together these results confirm the physical interaction between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and probably with _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis _LOCATION_ supporting the hypothesis that s role is conserved arabidopsis . to assess if _PROTEIN_ is involved in the induction of pcd in response to uv b radiation in arabidopsis cell death was evaluated in root tips . this technique has been widely used to investigate the role of different proteins in pcd after dna damage by uv b and other genotoxic stresses . for example in arabidopsis the role of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in pcd after uv b was analyzed by this technique this technique also was used for the analysis of the role of several dna translesion polymerases in pcd by uv b . to validate this hypothesis we generated arabidopsis transgenic plants that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ driven by the cauliflower mosaic virus promoter . five day old seedlings of the wild type and oe lines grown on murashige and skoog _METHOD_ agar plates were exposed to uv b radiation for h and then moved to a growth chamber for h in the absence of uv b . then the roots were stained with propidium iodide _PROTEIN_ as dead cells readily take up _PROTEIN_ while cells that are alive actively exclude _PROTEIN_ . root tips showed significantly fewer dead cells compared with the wild type roots . the opposite was observed in oe lines which showed around more dead cells than wild type root tips . in addition we analyzed cell death in root tips of _PROTEIN_ rnai double mutants and _PROTEIN_ rnai triple mutants exposed to uv b radiation . both mutants have significantly fewer dead cells than wild type roots but similar dead cells to mutants . these results are consistent with the _PROTEIN_ accumulation measured in these plants after a h uv b treatment strengthening the _PROTEIN_ that _PROTEIN_ and atham proteins participate in the same uv b induced dna damage response pathway . interestingly none of the analyzed lines showed dead cells when they were kept under control conditions in the absence of uv b . these results suggest that the role of _PROTEIN_ in pcd after uv b exposure is conserved in arabidopsis . furthermore we evaluated _PROTEIN_ accumulation after a h uv b treatment in plants overexpressing _PROTEIN_ . interestingly as shown in figure plants that overexpress _PROTEIN_ accumulate fewer _PROTEIN_ after the uv b treatment . finally in order to confirm the participation of _PROTEIN_ in pcd after uv b exposure we evaluated the integrity of the cells by measuring the electrolyte leakage of leaves . mutant plants exhibited a lower increase in electrolyte leakage than wild type plants after the uv b treatment while the opposite was observed in oe lines . moreover while wild type and mutant plants did not show any significant difference in total protein content after uv b radiation or in control conditions oe lines showed a significant reduction of total protein content after the uv b treatment . we also measured chlorophyll a and b contents in mutant and overexpressing plants . interestingly under control conditions in the absence of uv b mutants showed higher levels of both chlorophyll a and b than wild type plants while oe plants had lower chlorophyll levels than wild type plants . after a h uv b exposure oe plants showed a pronounced _PROTEIN_ in chlorophyll content similar to wild type plants in contrast mutants did not show any chlorosis . taken together our results demonstrate that _PROTEIN_ overexpression increases dna repair and cell death after uv b exposure while mutations in the gene cause the opposite effect . recently it was reported that developmental and environmental pcd processes take place by separate regulatory pathways . thus we finally investigated if _PROTEIN_ in addition to its participation in pcd after uv b exposure could be involved in the natural senescence of plants . during early development mutants looked similar to wild type plants except for having a smaller rosette area however mutants exhibited a remarkably delayed leaf senescence characterized by higher chlorophyll content compared with age matched wild type plants . in contrast oe plants showed lower levels of total chlorophyll in the leaves than wild type plants . interestingly at days after sowing while wild type and oe plants exhibited mostly senescing leaves leaves remained _PROTEIN_ green . in plants the onset of senescence occurred d _PROTEIN_ than in wild type or oe plants . the progress of leaf senescence also was delayed in mutants which took on average d for leaf from plants and and d for the same leaf from wild type and oe plants respectively . these results suggest that mutations in cause a delay in senescence while its overexpression accelerates leaf senescence . finally to further analyze if the spatiotemporal _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ correlates with its function in pcd during development we constructed transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ the gus gene under the control of the _PROTEIN_ promoter as described in materials and methods. in all transgenic lines analyzed the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ was high in the vasculature of leaves _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and roots . in these tissues pcd is essential during organ development . in addition gus activity was detected in anthers pollen stigma and developing seeds while in mature green siliques gus staining was observed in the septum and valves . together our data suggest that besides its role in pcd after uv b exposure _PROTEIN_ may also have a role in age induced pcd and also during other processes where pcd is essential during organ development as described previously in humans and rice .
following a cold treatment arabidopsis ecotype col and ws plants were grown in a growth chamber under light _METHOD_ with a h h dark photoperiod at . the mutant originated in the sail t dna insertion mutant collection and the mutant in the salk t dna insertion mutant collection both were obtained from the arabidopsis biological resource center . both mutants are in the col ecotype . the _PROTEIN_ rnai transgenic line was described previously . for pcd studies arabidopsis plants were germinated and grown on vertically oriented petri plates containing salt _METHOD_ agar medium for d. previously

growth chamber as described previously . arabidopsis plants were treated for h with a uv b intensity of w and a uv a intensity of w . the uv b bulbs were covered with cellulose acetate filters the cellulose acetate sheeting does not remove any uv b radiation from the spectrum but excludes wavelengths lower than nm . this uv b flux rate corresponds to uv b levels in sunlight measured in summer at midday in rosario argentina . control plants without uv b were exposed for the same period of time under the same uv b lamps but covered with polyester filters which absorb both uv b and wavelengths lower than nm . samples were collected immediately after irradiation and stored at . the experiments were repeated at least three times . for subcellular localization and pcd studies

and dapi were excited using an argon laser at nm and a uv laser at nm respectively . _METHOD_ emission was collected between and nm to avoid any interference of chlorophyll _METHOD_ . to analyze the percentage of _METHOD_ colocalization each _LOCATION_ identified by dapi _METHOD_ was examined for _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and whenever _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was detected the _LOCATION_ was scored as showing colocalization . thus the relative intensity of _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was not considered in these measurements . the percentage of _METHOD_ was calculated by the relation between the number of _LOCATION_ showing _METHOD_ localization and the total number of _LOCATION_ identified by dapi _METHOD_ . for each condition more than _LOCATION_ were analyzed from five different plants using four independent transgenic lines with comparable _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . the experiments were repeated three times . _LOCATION_ were isolated from das transgenic _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and wild type arabidopsis

primers were used to identify homozygous heterozygous and wild type plants for _PROTEIN_ . primer sequences are listed in supplemental table . homozygous single mutants were crossed with _PROTEIN_ rnai knockdown transgenic plants and its resultant population was screened for _PROTEIN_ rnai double mutants . the genotypes were determined by pcr on genomic dna using combinations of specific primers for and one primer that hybridizes with the left border of the t dna by cosegregation of the hygromycin resistance of the rna interference plants and by the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_

determined using the qubit dsdna assay kit and checked on a agarose gel stained with sybr safe after quantification . to make the _PROTEIN_ promoter gus construct the flanking dna of the _PROTEIN_ coding region was amplified by pcr with specific primers for the gene with hindiii and bamhi restriction sites in the forward and reverse primers respectively . the pcr fragment was cloned into the

the experiments were repeated at least three times using five independent lines with similar results . after growing plants for d on vertically oriented _METHOD_ plates seedlings were irradiated for h with a uv b intensity of w . uv b irradiated and nonirradiated control seedlings were then incubated for h in the growth chamber in the dark and pcd was analyzed as described by citation . root tips

r bamhi _METHOD_ with the kpni and bamhi restriction sites respectively were used . pcrs were performed using gotaq and pfu polymerases under the following conditions gotaq buffer mm of each primer and mm of each deoxyribonucleotide triphosphate in a final volume . the amplified products were purified cloned into pgem t easy vector and sequenced . the kpni bamhi and bamhi sali fragments were
