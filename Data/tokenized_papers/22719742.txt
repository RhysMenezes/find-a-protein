phospholipase hydrolyzes phospholipids at the sn position to yield lysophospholipids and free fatty acids . of the four paralogs _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis the cellular functions of in planta are poorly understood . the present study shows that possesses unique characteristics in _METHOD_ of spatiotemporal subcellular localization as compared with the other paralogs that remain in the _LOCATION_ and/or _LOCATION_ apparatus during secretory processes . only is secreted out to _LOCATION_ spaces and its secretion to apoplasts is modulated according to the developmental stages of plant tissues . observation of _METHOD_ transgenic plants suggests that localizes mostly at the _LOCATION_ bodies in actively growing leaf tissues but is gradually translocated to apoplasts as the leaves become mature . when pseudomonas syringae pv . tomato carrying the avirulent _PROTEIN_ infects the apoplasts of host plants rapidly translocates to the apoplasts where bacteria attempt to become established . promoter gus assays show that gene _PROTEIN_ is controlled in a developmental stage and tissue specific manner . it would be interesting to investigate if functions in plant defense responses at apoplasts where secreted confronts with invading pathogens .
although rt pcr analysis shows that transcripts are present in different parts of arabidopsis tissues there is little information _PROTEIN_ gene _PROTEIN_ at different developmental stages . to elucidate the cell type specific _PROTEIN_ patterns of the gene transgenic arabidopsis lines were generated that _PROTEIN_ the beta _PROTEIN_ reporter gene under the control of the promoter . gus activity was detected in the cotyledons the shoot apex the hypocotyl and the vascular tissues of day old germinated seedlings . strong gus activity was detected in the shoot apex in day old seedlings and week old plants and was preferentially _PROTEIN_ in young leaves rather than old leaves . no gus activity was detected in the roots at this stage . in week old plants gus _PROTEIN_ was found in the cauline leaves sepals styles and pedicel of reproductive tissues . the apical end of the pedicel is particularly dark stained apparently due to its _PROTEIN_ cell tissues based on a comparison with the gus staining of the control transgenic plants harboring the promoter fused with the gus gene . in plants transformed with gus gus _PROTEIN_ was also detected in the developing siliques and in the _PROTEIN_ roots of flowering plants . taken together these data indicate that gene _PROTEIN_ is controlled in a unique developmental stage and tissue specific manner . spatial and temporal _PROTEIN_ of . spatiotemporal _PROTEIN_ patterns of the gene in transgenic arabidopsis plants harboring the promoter fused with the gus gene . promoter activity was visualized by histochemical gus staining . seven day old plant . fourteen day old plant . three week old plant . flower cluster cauline leaf and stem of a week old plant . carpels and developing siliques of a week old plant . pedicel of the control transgenic plants harboring the promoter fused with the gus gene . root of a week old plant . bars mm . _PROTEIN_ reported that _METHOD_ signals for fusion proteins were observed at the _LOCATION_ apparatus of root hair cells . however showed time dependent localization of using a transient _PROTEIN_ system incorporating n. tabacum . the _METHOD_ reporter fused with was detected in cytoplasmic vesicles around the _LOCATION_ h after agroinfiltration to tobacco leaves and was detected at the _LOCATION_ spaces outside the cells at a _PROTEIN_ time point . to resolve these inconsistencies we investigated in more detail the subcellular localization of by analyzing the _METHOD_ of fusion proteins in transgenic plants carrying _METHOD_ . the leaves of week old _METHOD_ transgenic seedlings were viewed using a laser scanning confocal microscope . the results showed that the subcellular localization of was dependent on the developmental stages of leaf tissue . _METHOD_ fusion proteins were present primarily at the _LOCATION_ apparatus in pre mature young leaves whereas in mature leaves they were detected primarily in the apoplasts . even after cell plasmolysis was induced by treatment with n _PROTEIN_ for min the _METHOD_ signal remained in the _LOCATION_ spaces or diffused into the gap between the cell wall and the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ that is induced by plasmolysis . these results indicate that is indeed localized in the apoplasts of mature leaves . subcellular localization of at different leaf ages in _METHOD_ transgenic arabidopsis plants . epidermal cells in pre mature leaf tissues and mature leaf tissues from _METHOD_ transgenic arabidopsis plants were viewed using confocal microscopy . mature leaf tissues were incubated in n _PROTEIN_ to induce plasmolysis before being viewed with confocal microscopy . the slightly _PROTEIN_ clarity of images in appears to result from the diffusion of _METHOD_ into the expanded apoplasts due to plasmolysis . white arrows in indicate the plasmolyzed _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ whereas black arrows indicate _LOCATION_ spaces . _METHOD_ bright field and merged images are presented . bars . as secretion of proteins to apoplasts is known to occur through _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ bodies _METHOD_ signals were mostly detected at the _LOCATION_ bodies in pre mature young leaves . however the _METHOD_ spots become gradually bigger as the leaves become mature leading us to suspect that they may be other cellular organelles . to investigate if the big _METHOD_ spots are real _LOCATION_ bodies we performed co localization assay of with a _LOCATION_ body marker sialyltransferase _PROTEIN_ . close to mature leaves of transgenic arabidopsis plants _PROTEIN_ both _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were observed with a laser scanning confocal microscope . as shown in figure big spots of _METHOD_ signals are mostly overlapped with the spots of a _LOCATION_ body marker _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ confirming that is localized in _LOCATION_ apparatus before secretion to the apoplasts . we found that the apparent big size spots result from aggregation of several _LOCATION_ bodies and strong brightness of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . aggregation of _LOCATION_ bodies appears to be gradually enhanced as the leaves become mature . co localization of _METHOD_ with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ a _LOCATION_ body marker . close to mature leaves of transgenic arabidopsis plants _PROTEIN_ both _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were observed with a laser scanning confocal microscope . _METHOD_ signals are mostly overlapped with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ a _LOCATION_ body marker . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ bright field and merged image are presented . bar . as leaves become mature is secreted into the apoplast where it generates its lipid products lysophospholipids and free fatty acids . the lipid products have been suggested to function as bio active molecules that mediate a variety of cellular processes . apoplasts are an important site for the interaction of plant cell defense _METHOD_ with invading bacteria which attempt to become established in the apoplasts . if positively participates in defense responses to pathogen attack we hypothesized that its translocation to the apoplasts would be enhanced when pathogens are inoculated . as speculated the translocation of to the apoplasts was enhanced at h post inoculation of avirulent bacteria pst in young leaves and in close to mature leaves as compared to non treated controls and mm treated mocks . translocation of to apoplasts was enhanced by the inoculation of bacteria pst in pre mature young leaves . images showing increased _METHOD_ intensity and vesicle sizes followed by the translocation of to apoplasts at h post inoculation of pst compared to the no treatment control and mm treated mock in pre mature young leaves where is normally localized primarily in _LOCATION_ bodies . _METHOD_ bright field and merged images are presented . bars . enhanced translocation of to apoplasts in response to the inoculation of pst in close to mature leaves . significant enhancement of translocation to apoplasts was observed at h post inoculation of pst compared to the no treatment control and mm treated mock in close to mature leaves where is already detected at a low level in the apoplasts . _METHOD_ bright field and merged images are presented . bars .
arabidopsis thaliana plants were grown in soil pots at relative humidity with a h photoperiod and a photon flux density of m s . for histochemical localization studies a promoter gus construct was cloned by incorporating the sequence upstream of the _PROTEIN_ start codon into the hindiii and bamhi sites of the vector . the resulting plasmids were inserted into agrobacterium tumefaciens strain which was transformed into arabidopsis using the floral dip method as described previously _PROTEIN_ . histochemical gus assays to show tissue specific _PROTEIN_ at different developmental stages were performed as previously described . tissues from gus transformed plants were immersed in gus solution _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and incubated for h at due to its weak staining . after gus staining ethanol was used to remove the chlorophyll . to investigate the dynamics of subcellular localization transgenic arabidopsis plants carrying _METHOD_ were generated _PROTEIN_ . leaf tissues from the _METHOD_ transgenic arabidopsis plants were viewed at different developmental stages using a laser scanning confocal microscope after incubation in water or n _PROTEIN_ for min to trigger plasmolysis . _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was excited at nm and the emitted _METHOD_ was collected with a band pass filter at nm . to investigate whether _METHOD_ proteins are co localized with a _LOCATION_ marker _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgenic arabidopsis plants _PROTEIN_ both _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were generated _PROTEIN_ . close to mature leaves of week old transgenic plants were observed with a laser scanning confocal microscope . _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was detected using at nm and nm excitation/emission filter sets respectively . pseudomonas syringae pv . tomato carrying were obtained from y. j. kim . plants were inoculated by spreading a bacterial suspension onto the adaxial leaf surfaces of arabidopsis carrying _METHOD_ . plants designated as nt were given no treatment whereas mock plants were treated with v/v silwet l and mm . all the data presented in this study were obtained from at least three independent replicates .
