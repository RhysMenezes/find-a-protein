diverse kinesin motor proteins are involved in spindle function however the _METHOD_ by which they are targeted to specific sites within spindles are not well understood . here we show that a fusion between yellow _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ and a minus end directed kinesin from arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ localizes to mitotic spindle midzones and regions rich in growing plus ends within phragmoplasts . notably in arabidopsis interphase cells _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ localizes to microtubules with a preferential enrichment at growing plus ends indicating _PROTEIN_ is a plus end tracking protein _PROTEIN_ . this _PROTEIN_ activity is conferred by regions outside of the c terminal motor domain which reveals the presence of independent plus end tracking and minus end motor activities within _PROTEIN_ . furthermore mitotic spindles of _PROTEIN_ null mutant plants are abnormally broadened . based on these data we propose a model in which _PROTEIN_ uses plus end tracking to reach spindle midzones where it then organizes microtubules via minus end directed motor activity .
we first sought to elucidate the mechanism of _PROTEIN_ functioning by examining the dynamics of _PROTEIN_ subcellular localization in vivo . to this end full length _PROTEIN_ cdna was fused in frame to the end of _METHOD_ . the fusion gene was stably _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis plants and tobacco by cells under the control of constitutive or inducible _PROTEIN_ promoters . in arabidopsis plants _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ localized to microtubules in dividing cells of root tips and interphase cells of hypocotyls roots and leaves . notably in interphase cells _METHOD_ of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was not uniform along the length of microtubules but was enriched specifically at growing microtubule plus ends . figure shows a time sequence tracking a single microtubule over time . the microtubule is initially growing and then switches to shrinkage phase . as the microtubule switches from growth to shrinkage _METHOD_ accumulation at the plus end _PROTEIN_ to a level comparable with that seen along the microtubule sidewall . the plus end enrichment of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was dependent on the dynamic state of the microtubule accumulation of _METHOD_ at the plus end is lost upon microtubule catastrophe and restored upon rescue . this _METHOD_ pattern is consistent with that of a _PROTEIN_ . figure shows typical _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ intensity profiles along microtubules in both growth and shrinkage phases . in dividing tobacco by cells _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ localized to mitotic spindles and cytokinetic phragmoplasts . notably _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ accumulated in spindle midzones from early prometaphase _LOCATION_ to telophase . during metaphase _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was enriched on microtubules of the midzone region . as the cells progressed from metaphase to anaphase _METHOD_ remained concentrated on the overlapping region of midzone interpolar microtubules but it was not detected on kinetochore microtubules . as anaphase progressed the region of midzone _METHOD_ narrowed presumably corresponding to the known reduction in overlap between interdigitating interpolar microtubules as they slide apart during spindle elongation . in centrifugally expanding phragmoplasts _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was localized predominately at the leading edge just in front of the bulk of the microtubule population . phragmoplasts consist of two opposing sets of microtubules oriented with the plus ends facing inward where they often overlap in the middle . as phragmoplast expansion progresses microtubule depolymerization in the center is accompanied by polymerization at the leading edges indicating that the leading edge is rich in growing microtubule plus ends . these data show that _PROTEIN_ behaves as a _PROTEIN_ and that it accumulates at spindle midzones and phragmoplast leading edges . the observed plus end accumulation is inconsistent with the predicted minus end motor activity of _PROTEIN_ therefore we sought biochemical confirmation of minus end directed motor activity . to exclude the possibility that _PROTEIN_ uses plus end directed motor activity to reach growing microtubule plus ends full length _PROTEIN_ cdna was cloned into a _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ vector for bacterial _PROTEIN_ and in vitro microtubule gliding assays . the _PROTEIN_ control did not support microtubule motility . figure shows that in the presence of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ supports the minus end directed motility of microtubules . microtubules land and glide along the _PROTEIN_ coated surface with their plus ends leading showing that _PROTEIN_ is a minus end directed motor . this finding is consistent with the properties of all other kinesin family members studied to date . by measuring the velocity of microtubule translocation the speed of _PROTEIN_ was determined to be min at which is similar to _PROTEIN_ and other kinesin family members . additionally bacterially _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ also supported microtubule motility which _METHOD_ the viability of the fusion protein . these data show that _PROTEIN_ is a minus end directed motor thereby excluding the possibility that _PROTEIN_ motors toward microtubule plus ends . this suggests that the plus end tracking of _PROTEIN_ activity is independent of its motor activity . to determine whether the plus end tracking behavior was conferred by regions outside the motor domain a truncation was made consisting of only the tail and coiled coil stalk domains _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . this construct was stably _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis plants and by cells under control of the promoter . in arabidopsis plants _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ localized to microtubule plus ends in a manner similar to the full length _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . the time series plots depicted in figure c and d track single dynamic microtubule plus ends exhibiting loss of plus end _METHOD_ enrichment concurrent with catastrophe and restoration upon rescue . figure shows the typical _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ intensity profiles along microtubules in growth or shrinkage phases . these data indicate that the tail stalk region of _PROTEIN_ is responsible for the accumulation at growing microtubule plus ends . to exclude the possibility of cryptic plus end directed motor activity in the tail/stalk _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ also was _PROTEIN_ as a _PROTEIN_ fusion _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ did not support gliding of microtubules in vitro . when stably _PROTEIN_ in by cells _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ localized to spindles and phragmoplasts in a manner similar to the full length _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ thus excluding the possibility that midzone targeting of _PROTEIN_ is achieved by cross linking microtubules via motor and nonmotor microtubule binding sites . these data indicate that the tail/stalk region is responsible for targeting _PROTEIN_ to spindle midzones and phragmoplasts and suggest that _PROTEIN_ exerts force in these regions . to explore the role of _PROTEIN_ in mitotic spindles mutant _PROTEIN_ plants containing t dna insertions in coding regions of _PROTEIN_ were analyzed for defects in mitosis . rt pcr showed loss of transcript in mutant plants . two alleles designated _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ containing independent insertions in exon of _PROTEIN_ were studied . plants homozygous for either allele seem normal and exhibit developmental and reproductive characteristics indistinguishable from wild type . all data presented herein were obtained from _PROTEIN_ but comparable results were seen for _PROTEIN_ . using anti tubulin antibodies _METHOD_ was performed in wild type and _PROTEIN_ root mitotic cells . although interphase cells contained normal microtubule arrays dividing cells in the root tips of _PROTEIN_ mutant plants exhibited abnormally broadened mitotic spindles in metaphase and anaphase . spindle microtubules as well as chromosomes were _PROTEIN_ broadened throughout mitosis in _PROTEIN_ plants resulting in a greater distance between chromosomes at the metaphase plate however this did not affect the ability of the chromosomes to align during metaphase and segregate normally during anaphase . during metaphase mean spindle width was significantly larger in _PROTEIN_ compared with wild type as measured at the spindle midzone _PROTEIN_ and at spindle poles _PROTEIN_ . during anaphase mean spindle width was also significantly greater compared with wild type as measured both at the spindle midzone _PROTEIN_ and at the poles _PROTEIN_ . because _PROTEIN_ is localized predominately to the spindle midzone the spindle pole broadening is interpreted as largely a result of the loss of forces generated in the spindle midzone which links together rigid microtubules emanating from the poles .
