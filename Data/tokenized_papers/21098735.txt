cytokinesis in plants is achieved by the formation of the cell plate . a pathway that includes mitogen activated protein kinase kinase kinase and map kinase kinase plays a key role in the control of plant cytokinesis . we show here that a map kinase _PROTEIN_ is required for the formation of the cell plate in arabidopsis thaliana . single mutations in _PROTEIN_ caused dwarfism and characteristic defects in cytokinesis such as immature cell plates which became much more prominent upon introduction of a mutation in _PROTEIN_ the mapkk for cytokinesis into _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ strongly activated _PROTEIN_ in protoplasts and kinase activity of _PROTEIN_ was detected in wild type tissues that contained dividing cells but not in _PROTEIN_ mutants . _METHOD_ protein fused _PROTEIN_ localized to the expanding cell plates in cells of root tips . expansion of the cell plates in _PROTEIN_ root tips appeared to be retarded . the level of _PROTEIN_ transcripts was markedly elevated in _PROTEIN_ plants and defects in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant with respect to growth and cytokinesis were more severe than in the corresponding single mutants . these results indicate that _PROTEIN_ is the downstream target of _PROTEIN_ in the regulation of cytokinesis in arabidopsis and that _PROTEIN_ is also involved in cytokinesis .
the _PROTEIN_ allele on the columbia background corresponds to the _PROTEIN_ gene with a t dna insert in the sixth exon . the plant with this allele has been reported to be a null mutant . in our laboratory the _PROTEIN_ mutant that was provided by the stock center was backcrossed with the wild type plant three times and progeny plants were used in these experiments . a wild type phenotype was restored by a transgene that contained the _PROTEIN_ genomic region . as described below we failed to detect the _PROTEIN_ transcript and _PROTEIN_ protein in the _PROTEIN_ mutant an observation consistent with the previously reported observation . homozygous _PROTEIN_ mutant plants exhibited severe aboveground dwarfism retarded root growth and the protrusion of many epidermal cells from roots . the _PROTEIN_ homozygous mutant set only a few flowers and these flowers produced very few viable seeds or none at all . the roots and cotyledons of the _PROTEIN_ mutant contained enlarged cells with incomplete cell walls and multiple _LOCATION_ as also observed previously in the _PROTEIN_ mapkk mutant . these results suggested that formation of the cell plate was severely impaired in dividing cells of the _PROTEIN_ mutant . in this study the _PROTEIN_ mutation on the landsberg _LOCATION_ background was the result of an insertion of a ds transposon in the first intron of the _PROTEIN_ gene . although _PROTEIN_ plants also exhibited aboveground dwarfism consistent with a previous observation the roots were relatively normal and no obvious cytokinetic defects were detected in cotyledons and roots . we examined the splicing of the ds containing intron sequence in mrna from this mutant by rt pcr using a pair of primers that extended from the first exon to the second exon . we detected a transcript of the normal wild type size but the level of the transcript was very much lower than in the wild type . analysis of the nucleotide sequence of the transcript revealed that the first intron plus ds had been appropriately excised in _PROTEIN_ plants . thus this allele _METHOD_ to correspond to a weak mutation . by contrast no corresponding band was detected in the analysis of the rna from _PROTEIN_ plants under the same conditions suggesting that the _PROTEIN_ mutation has a stronger effect than _PROTEIN_ an observation consistent with the phenotypic difference noted above . since the _PROTEIN_ allele was on the col background we transferred the _PROTEIN_ allele from the ler background to the col background by outcrossing and then we examined the resultant phenotypes . figure shows that the _PROTEIN_ allele on the col background resulted in more severe dwarfism than the same allele on the ler background . the protrusion of root epidermal cells was also evident in the _PROTEIN_ plants as well as in the _PROTEIN_ plants with the col background even though no such protrusions were observed in the case of _PROTEIN_ roots with the ler background . to date protrusions of this type have always been associated with defects in cytokinesis in mutants such as _PROTEIN_ and . examination of cross sections revealed that roots and cotyledons of _PROTEIN_ plants contained unusually large cells with incomplete cell walls and multiple _LOCATION_ . by contrast cells of _PROTEIN_ did not exhibit such abnormalities . phenotypic analysis of double mutants demonstrated that _PROTEIN_ anq exhibited more severe dwarfism than either single mutant confirming a role for _PROTEIN_ in cytokinesis . to examine the genetic interaction between _PROTEIN_ and anq in more detail we generated _PROTEIN_ anq double heterozygotes and determined the genotypes of self pollinated progeny by examining the presence or the absence of the t dna that caused each respective mutation . as shown in supplemental table online the segregation ratios of the genotypes of the progeny deviated from the expected mendelian frequencies . segregation efficiencies of the genotypes _PROTEIN_ anq _PROTEIN_ anq and _PROTEIN_ anq were markedly lower than the expected values . in particular the reduction in frequency of _PROTEIN_ anq and _PROTEIN_ anq was greater than the reduction in frequency of _PROTEIN_ anq plants . these results showed that both the _PROTEIN_ and the anq mutations negatively affected some or all of the following the formation of gametes in the parent fertilization and the viability of progeny plants . to examine the viability of _PROTEIN_ anq gametes we performed reciprocal crosses between an _PROTEIN_ anq double heterozygote and a wild type parent . when we used mutant pollen from the _PROTEIN_ anq parent for crosses with a wild type female parent mutant alleles were transmitted to of the offspring as expected indicating that male gametophytes were viable . however when we used pollen from the wild type parent for crosses with the _PROTEIN_ anq female parent the mutant alleles _PROTEIN_ anq or _PROTEIN_ plus anq were transmitted to the offspring at much lower than expected frequencies . we found that of female gametophytes and/or embryos that harbored _PROTEIN_ of those that harbored anq and of those that harbored both _PROTEIN_ and anq were not viable . the lower segregation efficiencies of mutants with the anq _PROTEIN_ anq and _PROTEIN_ anq alleles that are shown in supplemental table online can be predicted from the viabilities summarized in table . results of reciprocal crosses between the _PROTEIN_ anq mutant and wild type plants to investigate the possible involvement in cytokinesis of other mapks in group b we analyzed the _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ genes in wild type plants as well as the phenotypes of the single mutants _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and the double mutants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . we prepared poly rnas from shoot apices mature leaves and flower buds of wild type plants and quantified the transcripts of the various mapk genes by real time rt pcr . levels of _PROTEIN_ transcripts in shoot apices flower buds and mature leaves did not differ significantly . transcripts of other mapk genes including _PROTEIN_ were detected in tissues that contained dividing cells but their levels were higher in mature leaves than in tissues with dividing cells . in this study the _PROTEIN_ mutant was backcrossed with the wild type and the _PROTEIN_ mutant was outcrossed with the wild type three times or more . the progeny of these crosses were used for analyses . the predicted amino acid sequence of _PROTEIN_ exhibits the strongest amino acid sequence similarity to that of _PROTEIN_ among members of the group b subfamily . a t dna insertion mutation in the _PROTEIN_ gene resulted in plants with normal morphology which were indistinguishable from wild type plants . the dwarfism of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant plants was however more severe than that of the _PROTEIN_ single mutant and the petioles of the double mutant were much shorter than _PROTEIN_ petioles . the double mutant was unable to develop inflorescences . to quantify cytokinetic defects in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plants we counted the cells with incomplete cell walls in cotyledons of these mutants . although the cytokinetic defects in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ cotyledons were relatively weak compared with those in other organs such as roots we chose to use cotyledons for quantitative analysis because of the small sizes of cells . we prepared series of transverse sections starting from the middle of the cotyledons of d old plants . there were no cell wall defective cells in sections of _PROTEIN_ cotyledons . however the percentage of cells with incomplete cell walls in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant was significantly higher than in the _PROTEIN_ single mutant . the frequency of cells with an incomplete cell plate in cotyledons we also examined a t dna insertion mutant of the _PROTEIN_ gene and the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant for possible cytokinetic defects since the amino acid sequence of _PROTEIN_ also resembles that of tobacco _PROTEIN_ more closely than do those of other mapks . as shown in supplemental figure online there were no apparent abnormalities in the _PROTEIN_ single mutant and there was no significant phenotypic difference between the _PROTEIN_ single mutant and the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant . supplemental table online shows that on average and of cells in the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutants had incomplete cell walls respectively . we measured levels of _PROTEIN_ transcripts in _PROTEIN_ plants by quantitative real time rt pcr with poly rnas that had been prepared from shoot apices and cotyledons . in shoot apices the level of _PROTEIN_ transcripts was fold higher in the _PROTEIN_ mutant than in the wild type . levels of _PROTEIN_ transcripts were also fold higher in the mutant cotyledons . similar increases were also observed in _PROTEIN_ leaves . however levels of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ transcripts in the shoot apices of _PROTEIN_ were similar to those of in the shoot apices of wild type plants . levels of _PROTEIN_ transcripts were very similar in the shoot apices of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants which have defects in cytokinesis . thus marked increases in levels of _PROTEIN_ transcripts appeared to be specific to plants with the mutation in the _PROTEIN_ gene . we tested mapks for potential activation by _PROTEIN_ mapkk using protoplasts of cells from arabidopsis plants . five cdnas for hemagglutinin tagged group b mapks _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were coexpressed separately with cdnas for kinase inactive _PROTEIN_ wild type and constitutively active _METHOD_ respectively of myc tagged _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . after immunoprecipitation of each ha tagged mapk we determined their activities in kinase assays in vitro with myelin basic protein as an artificial substrate . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were activated by the constitutively active _PROTEIN_ . activation of _PROTEIN_ by _PROTEIN_ was consistent with a previous observation by citation . _PROTEIN_ was only weakly activated . we also examined members of group c _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ group a _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and group d _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ for activation in similar assays . _PROTEIN_ activity was slightly increased by coexpression of constitutively active _PROTEIN_ myc but other mapks that we tested were not activated . we raised polyclonal _PROTEIN_ specific antibodies in rabbits which were immunized with a synthetic oligopeptide that corresponded to amino acid residues to of _PROTEIN_ . the antibodies recognized a single protein of kd which corresponds to the estimated molecular _METHOD_ of _PROTEIN_ in a protein extract prepared from wild type plants . the signal that corresponded to this protein was not detected in extracts prepared from the _PROTEIN_ mutant demonstrating that _PROTEIN_ mutant plants failed to produce detectable amounts of _PROTEIN_ . we prepared protein extracts from wild type and _PROTEIN_ whole plants developing first and second leaves mature cotyledons shoot apices roots without tips and root tips . then we performed immunocomplex kinase assays with the _PROTEIN_ specific antibodies and mbp as the artificial substrate . as shown in figure we detected very weak activities of _PROTEIN_ protein kinase in protein extracts from whole wild type and _PROTEIN_ plants respectively . the activity of _PROTEIN_ was clearly detected in extracts of developing leaves shoot apices and root tips all of which contain actively dividing cells but no clear activity was detected in extracts of mature cotyledons and roots without tips under the same conditions . these results suggested that _PROTEIN_ might be activated in tissues that contain dividing cells . we examined whether a mutation in the _PROTEIN_ gene for a mapkk that was involved in the activation of _PROTEIN_ might affect the activity of _PROTEIN_ in planta . we prepared protein extracts from developing first and second leaves plus shoot apices of wild type plants of _PROTEIN_ mutant plants and of _PROTEIN_ mutant plants and performed immunocomplex kinase assays with the _PROTEIN_ specific antibodies . although kinase activity was clearly detected in the immunocomplex from the wild type extract lower levels of activity were detected in immunocomplexes from _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ extracts . these results were consistent with the observation that _PROTEIN_ was activated in the presence of _PROTEIN_ in vivo and in vitro . we generated transgenic _PROTEIN_ plants that _PROTEIN_ a fusion of the entire _PROTEIN_ locus with the cdna construct for yellow _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ at the c terminus _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . in the transgenic plants the _PROTEIN_ dwarf phenotype was reversed suggesting that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was functional . upon further examination of these plants we observed signals due to _METHOD_ in the root cells in the division zone . confocal microscopy revealed that signals due to _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in most of the cells were localized both in the cytoplasm and in the _LOCATION_ consistent with previous observations . in a significant proportion of the cells however signals due to _METHOD_ were concentrated in the region that corresponded to the cell division plane both at early stages when the _LOCATION_ had not yet reformed and _PROTEIN_ when the two daughter _LOCATION_ had reformed . we stained root tips of the transgenic wild type plant that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ with to label cell plates and observed signals due to _METHOD_ and in cells of the division zone . as shown in figures to _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was localized to the cell plate . time lapse analyses with demonstrated that the cell plate in wild type root cells extended toward the parental cell walls in min which is consistent with the recently reported observation . by contrast cell plates in _PROTEIN_ root cells slightly or barely expanded over min .
