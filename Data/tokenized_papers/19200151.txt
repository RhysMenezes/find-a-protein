arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ is predicted to encode a novel protein of amino acid residues in length with four putative domains . in the present study characterization of _PROTEIN_ is conducted . green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ fusion protein assay showed that _PROTEIN_ was located in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . transgenic lines overexpressing _PROTEIN_ driven by a camv promoter were generated . statistic analysis showed that during the seedling stage the organ sizes of the transgenic lines including hypocotyl length root length and root weight were significantly larger than those of the wild type plants under both light and dark conditions . in the adult plant stage the _PROTEIN_ overexpressor plants were found to have larger organ sizes in _METHOD_ of leaf length and width and increased number of cauline leaves and branches when bolting . further observation indicated that the larger leaf size phenotype was due to a larger number of mesophyll cells the size of which was not altered . quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis showed that the transcription of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were upregulated in the _PROTEIN_ plants . these data suggest that _PROTEIN_ is possibly a positive regulator of organ size development in arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ through cell number control .
bioinformatics analysis showed that _PROTEIN_ was predicted to encode a functionally unknown protein of amino acid residues in length with four distinct domains . _PROTEIN_ belongs to a gene family with six members in arabidopsis . the sequence identity among these proteins ranged from to . a database search did not find homologous sequences in _METHOD_ other than plants suggesting that _PROTEIN_ possibly encodes a _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ protein in arabidopsis . we transformed wild type arabidopsis thaliana with the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ fusion protein construct driven by a camv promoter and successfully obtained independent transgenic lines used to study the subcellular localization using confocal imaging . as shown in figure green _METHOD_ was found in the _LOCATION_ of the cells in undifferentiated cells in the root tip extension zone of _METHOD_ transgenic plants different from the ubiquitous _PROTEIN_ pattern of _METHOD_ in _METHOD_ plants . this suggests that _PROTEIN_ protein _PROTEIN_ localizes in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ in root tip cells which was also supported by transient _PROTEIN_ assay . to analyze the _PROTEIN_ pattern of _PROTEIN_ we amplified a kb long fragment from the _PROTEIN_ promoter and fused it to prior to transformation into wild type arabidopsis . analysis of the transgenic plants showed that the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ focused in young leaves hypocotyl and in the roots of the seedlings . in adult plants _PROTEIN_ transcripts were _PROTEIN_ concentrated in the roots and flower organs including young upper _METHOD_ shoot tips and shoot apical _METHOD_ and flower buds . to characterize the biological function of _PROTEIN_ transgenic plants transformed with the _PROTEIN_ overexpression construct driven by a camv promoter were generated . analysis showed that the transcript level of _PROTEIN_ was elevated in three overexpressor lines and among which had the highest . homozygous transgenic plants were used for further analysis . compared with the wild type _PROTEIN_ overexpressor plants were larger . statistic analysis showed that all three overexpressor lines exhibited enlarged organ sizes including increased plant height increased number of rosette leaves and increased branch number . for example the average plant height was cm for plants in comparison with cm for wild type at the same developmental stage . analysis showed that the phenotypes in the three overexpressor lines were correlated with the _PROTEIN_ level of _PROTEIN_ . we also examined the root growth of the overexpressor lines . under normal growth conditions root length differences were observed between and wild type after weeks growth on and skoog _METHOD_ medium . the average root length of wild type was mm whereas that of was mm . seedlings also grew faster than the wild type on _METHOD_ medium resulting in heavier root fresh weight and longer root and hypocotyls . in addition to vegetative organs we also found that the size of seeds was bigger than that of the wild type . the seed diameter of was bigger than that of the wild type . to elucidate the mechanism of organ size enlargement in the _PROTEIN_ overexpressor lines cell number and area on the fifth rosette leaf surface of _PROTEIN_ overexpressor plants were examined using scanning electron microscopy _PROTEIN_ . the result showed that on abaxial surface the leaf surface area and the cell numbers in the _PROTEIN_ overexpressor plants and wild type respectively increased from and to and respectively . these data suggest that although the cell size is altered cell number increase _PROTEIN_ accounts for the leaf surface area increase . we then examined the _PROTEIN_ level of some important leaf genes in the _PROTEIN_ overexpressor plants by quantitative pcr analysis . the results showed that compared with wild type the transcription level of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were significantly upregulated whereas that of _PROTEIN_ and atgif were not much altered .
