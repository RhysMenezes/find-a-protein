the land plant arabidopsis thaliana contains three closely related _LOCATION_ genes encoding rna polymerases . the gene products of rpot and rpot have previously been shown to be imported into mitochondria and chloroplasts respectively . here we show that the transit peptide of rpot possesses dual targeting properties . transient _PROTEIN_ assays in tobacco protoplasts as well as stable transformation of arabidopsis plants demonstrate efficient targeting of fusion peptides consisting of the of rpot joined to green _METHOD_ protein to both organelles . thus rpot might be the first rna polymerase shown to transcribe genes in two different genomes . rna polymerase activity of recombinant rpot is uneffected by the inhibitor tagetin qualifying the gene product of rpot as a polymerase .
the cdna sequence of arabidopsis rpot of nucleotides was obtained by aligning overlapping rt pcr and _PROTEIN_ products . the reaction gave rise to a single product the untranslated leader sequence of nt contains one stop codon . the was found to be variable or nt indicating the presence of at least two polyadenylation sites . mitochondrial and _LOCATION_ transit peptides exhibit primary sequence features such as richness in hydroxylated amino acids and a low abundance of acidic residues as well as the ability to form and amphiphilic respectively . analysis of rpot using common targeting prediction _METHOD_ did not yield conclusive results but detected a consensus sequence pattern for the cleavage of mitochochondrial targeting sequences at residue . to investigate the cellular localization of rpot amino acids were translationally fused to the green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ coding region and used to transform tobacco protoplasts . transient _PROTEIN_ was examined using confocal laser scanning microscopy _PROTEIN_ . the rpot _METHOD_ construct gave rise to _METHOD_ _METHOD_ both in typical mitochondrial structures of punctate morphology and in chloroplasts . combination of green and red _METHOD_ channels confirmed of red and green _METHOD_ in chloroplasts which appeared in the merged image to orange . a control construct with known mitochondrial targeting showed the expected punctate _METHOD_ localization . using a _LOCATION_ control construct the green _METHOD_ was coincident with the chloroplast structures . although the complete sequence of arabidopsis rpot is more similar to the mitochondrial polymerase rpot its putative transit peptide exhibits features of the of both rpot and rpot . while the amino acids of rpot show limited similarity to the of rpot the extreme of rpot aligns to a similar region in rpot . hence a potential second translation initiation site is present in the sequence of rpot . two further constructs were generated to investigate both sites independently . to show that dual targeting is not due to concurrent initiation from both methionines the aug at codon position was mutated to encode isoleucine instead of methionine _METHOD_ . the other construct contained a shortened transit peptide starting at the second methionine _METHOD_ . to enhance the sensitivity of _METHOD_ visualization by avoiding chlorophyll _METHOD_ protoplasts were prepared from white leaves of tobacco plants lacking the _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ gene . fig ref shows a comparison of the _METHOD_ localization employing the different constructs . both rpot _METHOD_ and rpot _METHOD_ exhibited dual targeting with _METHOD_ _METHOD_ occuring in both mitochondria and _LOCATION_ . the latter are characterized by the occurence of typical _LOCATION_ vesicles inside the organelles . however when we used the shortened transit peptide starting at the second aug _METHOD_ _LOCATION_ showed no _METHOD_ leaving mitochondria as the sole target of _METHOD_ . we conclude that initiation at the first methionine is essentially required for dual targeting of rpot into _LOCATION_ and mitochondria . to confirm the data obtained by transient _PROTEIN_ with tobacco protoplasts in a homologous system a construct containing the of rpot was used for stable transformation of arabidopsis . in root tissue of transgenic plants _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was detected in typical punctate mitochondria as well as in much larger structures being qualified as _LOCATION_ by chlorophyll _METHOD_ in some pigment containing chloroplasts . _LOCATION_ targeting was corroborated unequivocally by observations in green tissue of the transformants . counterstaining with a mitochondrial specific dye proved of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ within mitochondria . _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was not superimposed by . thus subcellular localization of the _METHOD_ fusion constructs in stably transformed arabidopsis plants was the same as in transiently _PROTEIN_ tobacco protoplasts confirming that dual targeting is indeed a general property of the rpot transit peptidein arabidopsis . since an enzymatic activity has not been demonstrated yet for an arabidopsis rpot gene product we fused the coding region of the gene with exception of amino acid residues coding for the putative transit peptide to a sequence and _PROTEIN_ the construct in escherichia coli . a kda recombinant protein was found to be _PROTEIN_ in soluble form . the polypeptide was partially purified using a nickel agarose _PROTEIN_ and a dialysis procedure . the recombinant protein revealed unspecific rna polymerase activity in an in vitro assay with activated calf thymus dna as a template . to prove that recombinant preparations were free of e. coli rnap we tested the effects of different transcription inhibitors . most remarkably tagetin a potent inhibitor of polymerases which has been also used to discriminate between the _LOCATION_ rnap and the _LOCATION_ rnap in chloroplast transcription did not inhibit the activity of the recombinant protein implying that rpot indeed encodes a functional rna polymerase . actinomycin d however did not completely suppress rna synthesis in the preparations .
