in arabidopsis four root _PROTEIN_ amt genes encode functional ammonium transporters which raises the question of their role in primary ammonium uptake . after pre culturing under nitrogen deficiency conditions we quantified the influx of labeled ammonium in t dna insertion lines and observed that the loss of either _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ led to a _PROTEIN_ in the high affinity ammonium influx of approximately . under nitrogen sufficient conditions the ammonium influx was lower in columbia glabra compared with wassilewskija and _PROTEIN_ did not contribute significantly to the ammonium influx in col gl . ectopic _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ under the control of a promoter in either of the insertion lines _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ increased the ammonium influx above the level of their corresponding wild types . in transgenic lines carrying amt promoter _METHOD_ constructs the promoter activities of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were both upregulated under nitrogen deficiency conditions and were localized to the rhizodermis including root hairs . amt gene _METHOD_ fusions that were stably _PROTEIN_ under the control of their own promoters were localized to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . the double insertion line _PROTEIN_ showed a _PROTEIN_ sensitivity to the toxic ammonium analog methylammonium and a _PROTEIN_ in the ammonium influx of up to relative to wild type plants . these results suggest an additive contribution of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ to the overall ammonium uptake capacity in arabidopsis roots under nitrogen deficiency conditions .
to investigate the contribution of _PROTEIN_ to the overall ammonium uptake in roots a t dna insertion line in the wassilewskija background was isolated from the feldman dupont collection . analysis of progeny of a backcross of the _PROTEIN_ to wild type revealed the presence of a single t dna insertion that segregated in a mendelian ratio . the t dna was found to be inserted bp upstream of the start codon and led to a complete loss of _PROTEIN_ transcripts in the roots of homozygous insertion progenies . roots of hydroponically grown wild type and _PROTEIN_ plants were then used for the extraction of microsomal _LOCATION_ fractions and subsequent western analysis . an antibody that had been raised against amino acids from the c terminus of _PROTEIN_ detected a specific band at approximately kd in microsomal _LOCATION_ fractions of wild type roots . this is somewhat lower than the calculated molecular weight of _PROTEIN_ although a faster gel migration would be consistent with the hydrophobic nature of the protein . consistent with the loss of the transcript no western signal was detectable in _LOCATION_ protein preparations from roots of the _PROTEIN_ insertion line . both lines were then grown for days on nutrient solution containing mm ammonium nitrate as a nitrogen source and the concentration dependent influx of labeled ammonium was determined using stable isotope _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . in wild type roots ammonium influx followed biphasic kinetics with steeply increasing uptake rates up to of ammonium before approaching saturation and a more linear concentration dependence at millimolar concentrations . similar biphasic uptake kinetics has also been observed for ammonium in the roots of the arabidopsis ecotype col where the uptake response was linear in the millimolar range . in contrast ammonium influx into _PROTEIN_ roots was approximately lower in the micromolar concentration range but did not differ significantly from the wild type between and mm of external ammonium . this kinetic analysis of ammonium uptake indicated that _PROTEIN_ is a high affinity ammonium transporter with a less consistent contribution to ammonium influx at millimolar ammonium concentrations . the line _PROTEIN_ was then transformed with a wild type _PROTEIN_ open reading frame under the control of a promoter . a promoter was chosen to determine the quantitative contribution of _PROTEIN_ to ammonium uptake at an elevated level of gene _PROTEIN_ . among four lines from the generation that were homozygous according to selectable marker analysis two lines showed a strong accumulation of _PROTEIN_ mrna . western analysis showed that these high transcript levels were also translated into high protein levels irrespective of the nitrogen supply to the nutrient solution . in contrast _PROTEIN_ mrna and protein levels in the roots of wild type plants were low under an adequate supply of nitrogen and steeply increased after days of growth under nitrogen deficiency conditions . the _PROTEIN_ re transformed lines and were then subjected to influx analysis at of labeled ammonium as a measure for high affinity uptake . irrespective of the nitrogen nutritional status _PROTEIN_ showed an approximately lower uptake capacity than in the wild type . in both _PROTEIN_ re transformed lines the uptake was either clearly restored or even exceeded that of the wild type plants . these observations indicated that _PROTEIN_ contributed to the overall capacity for high affinity ammonium uptake in arabidopsis roots under nitrogen sufficient as well as under nitrogen deficient growth conditions . according to the strong de repression of _PROTEIN_ gene _PROTEIN_ under nitrogen deficiency conditions and the concomitant increase in ammonium uptake capacity it was considered that _PROTEIN_ may also make a major contribution to ammonium influx in nitrogen deficient arabidopsis roots . we therefore isolated a t dna insertion line from the enhancer trap collection of thomas jack and verified a single t dna insertion status and homozygosity by pcr and segregation analysis after a backcross to the wild type . the t dna insertion _PROTEIN_ was located bp upstream of the start codon in the untranslated region of _PROTEIN_ and led to a complete loss of detectable _PROTEIN_ mrna in roots from plants hydroponically pre cultured under nitrogen deficiency conditions . to monitor the changes in protein accumulation an antibody was raised against amino acids from the loop between the transmembrane spanning domains and of _PROTEIN_ . in a protein gel blot analysis this antibody recognized a specific protein band at approximately kd in microsomal _LOCATION_ fractions from wild type roots . in contrast no band was detectable on a protein gel blot of _LOCATION_ proteins from _PROTEIN_ roots . a concentration dependent influx analysis was then conducted with plants pre cultured under nitrogen sufficient and nitrogen deficient growth conditions . under adequate nitrogen supply wild type and _PROTEIN_ plants did not differ in ammonium influx . although the _PROTEIN_ mutant showed a several fold increase in root ammonium influx under nitrogen starvation conditions the ammonium influx remained below that of the wild type with an external supply of up to ammonium . despite little variation in the experimental setup this observation was in strong agreement with the report by citation who isolated the same t dna insertion line and also observed a lower uptake capacity in their homozygous descendants in the same concentration range . as a further test of whether both amts act in the same physiological process under nitrogen deficiency _PROTEIN_ plants were transformed with _PROTEIN_ and subjected to influx analysis . among four transgenic lines the lines and showed a strong _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ at the mrna level and a concomitant increase in the level of protein . relative to _PROTEIN_ and the corresponding wild type the other two transgenic lines actually showed repressed _PROTEIN_ transcript and protein levels which was most probably caused by a silencing effect . under adequate nitrogen supply ammonium influx in the _PROTEIN_ transformed lines and exceeded that of the wild type and the _PROTEIN_ insertion line confirming that growth conditions of adequate nitrogen supply allow an increase in the overall uptake capacity by increasing the protein quantity of _PROTEIN_ as they did in _PROTEIN_ . importantly under nitrogen deficient conditions the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ compensated for the uptake defect in _PROTEIN_ indicating that the biochemical properties of _PROTEIN_ allowed substitution for the physiological function of _PROTEIN_ . although the lower overall ammonium uptake capacity of columbia glabra relative to ws was reflected in a slightly lower contribution of _PROTEIN_ in col gl the quantitative contribution of _PROTEIN_ remained exactly the same in both ecotypes irrespective of whether plants were exposed to either nitrogen sufficient or nitrogen deficient growth conditions and absolute uptake capacities were strongly enhanced . thus the different genetic background of the two insertion lines apparently did not exert a nitrogen dependent regulatory effect on the ammonium uptake capacity conferred by _PROTEIN_ . although _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ make a similar contribution to the overall ammonium uptake in nitrogen deficient plants their physiological roles may also depend either on tissue or intracellular localization of _PROTEIN_ . we therefore fused bp of the upstream region of _PROTEIN_ and bp of the upstream region of _PROTEIN_ to _METHOD_ and analyzed the _METHOD_ dependent _METHOD_ in several transgenic arabidopsis lines transformed with these fusion constructs . in general the strongest _METHOD_ in roots was confined to the apical root region as well as to the root hair zone whereas _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in more basal root parts . in root tips of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ plants _METHOD_ was low after nitrogen adequate pre culture but was strongly increased under nitrogen deficiency conditions which was in agreement with our gene _PROTEIN_ analysis . in the lower and younger root hair zone promoter activity was localized to cortical cells and to rhizodermal cells including root hairs . as in root tips promoter dependent _METHOD_ was subject to a strong increase under nitrogen deficiency . in the upper root hair zone _METHOD_ remained restricted to the same cell types and was only slightly enhanced by nitrogen deficiency . the parallel analysis of an _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ construct yielded an unexpected result . under nitrogen sufficient growth conditions weak promoter activity appeared in the root tip and in outer cells of more basal root zones but was intense in pericycle cells of the root hair zone and above . however under nitrogen deficiency conditions _PROTEIN_ promoter dependent _METHOD_ was also localized to rhizodermal cells including root hairs . in root tips _METHOD_ was also enhanced in inner cell layers being almost completely complementary in location to that of _PROTEIN_ promoter dependent _METHOD_ . thus a common feature of both promoters was that their activities increased under nitrogen deficiency in particular in rhizodermal cells including root hairs and in the root tip . the intracellular localization of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ was investigated in transgenic arabidopsis plants _PROTEIN_ c terminal amt gene _METHOD_ fusions under the control of the native promoter . confocal imaging was focussed on root hairs which were less vacuolated and allowed the visualization of cytoplasmic content . again _METHOD_ dependent _METHOD_ of both fusion proteins increased in nitrogen deficient arabidopsis roots but now appeared in a thin zone along the border of individual root hair cells . _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ were then stained by a short incubation with the hydrophobic red _METHOD_ dye which was found to colocalize with the green amt dependent _METHOD_ after the two separate images were merged . these observations indicated that both transporters _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ reside in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ in arabidopsis root cells . to investigate a possible physiological redundancy between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ we generated a double insertion line by crossing _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ . plants homozygous for both insertions were grown hydroponically along with the single insertion lines and the corresponding wild types and gene _PROTEIN_ was monitored by rna gel blot analysis . as expected transcripts of both amts were not detectable in the dko . a phenotypical analysis was conducted in a pre fertilized peat based substrate in nutrient solution either under nitrogen deficiency conditions or with a supply of mm ammonium nitrate and on agar under a supply of either ammonium or ammonium nitrate . however neither the visual appearance nor the growth of single and double insertion lines differed from that of the two wild types under these screening conditions . thus the phenotype for the _PROTEIN_ t dna insertion line as reported in citation could not be confirmed under our growth conditions . one reason for this might be that in both experiments the growth conditions differed with _PROTEIN_ to the sterility of the hydroponic culture sucrose supply oxygen supply to roots and light intensity . we then added the toxic ammonium analog methylammonium to agar grown plants . supply of only mm nitrate to the agar medium kept these plants under nitrogen limited growth to assure the _PROTEIN_ of both amts . in general ws appeared to be more sensitive to methylammonium than columbia glabra . the addition of > mm methylammonium strongly inhibited germination and seedling growth was repressed in both wild types as well as in the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ single insertion lines . in contrast dko seedlings remained green and clearly exhibited a _PROTEIN_ sensitivity . double insertion lines from different nitrogen pre cultures were then subjected to ammonium influx measurements at of external ammonium supply . in plants grown under adequate nitrogen nutrition ammonium influx in _PROTEIN_ was again approximately lower than in the corresponding wild type ws whereas the influx in the _PROTEIN_ insertion line did not significantly differ from its wild type col gl . the uptake capacity of the dko was slightly lower relative to both single insertion lines . however with increasing nitrogen deficiency both single insertion lines exhibited an approximately reduction in ammonium influx whereas the dko lost approximately of its uptake capacity . although uptake rates steadily increased with the time of nitrogen starvation in all lines it was remarkable to note that the relative contribution of the two transporters remained similar . in a quantitative rt pcr analysis citation reported an upregulation of _PROTEIN_ mrna levels in nitrogen deficient roots of their _PROTEIN_ t dna insertion line which might be suggestive of a compensatory response by homologous amt genes in arabidopsis . in our experiments _PROTEIN_ transcript and protein levels in _PROTEIN_ as well as _PROTEIN_ transcript and protein levels in _PROTEIN_ were no different to the corresponding gene _PROTEIN_ levels in their wild types under different nitrogen regimes . thus a compensatory upregulation of one of the two genes as a consequence of the loss of the other gene was not observed . likewise mrna levels of other root _PROTEIN_ amt genes namely _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ also did not change as a consequence of these gene disruptions . these observations were in good agreement with the _PROTEIN_ sensitivity of the dko to methylammonium and strongly indicated an additive contribution of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ to root ammonium influx .
