in eukaryotic cells ptdins kinase _PROTEIN_ produces ptdins from ptdins p and functions in _LOCATION_ homeostasis . herein we show that _PROTEIN_ of arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ in fission yeast _PROTEIN_ knockout cells fully complements the _LOCATION_ morphology phenotype . subcellular localizations of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ fused with green _METHOD_ protein revealed that _PROTEIN_ green _METHOD_ proteins localize to the endosomes in root epidermal cells of arabidopsis . furthermore reduction in the _PROTEIN_ levels of _PROTEIN_ by rna interference impairs _LOCATION_ acidification and endocytosis . these results indicate that arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ functions as ptdins kinase in plants and in fission yeast . conditional knockdown mutant shows various phenotypes including root growth inhibition hyposensitivity to exogenous auxin and disturbance of root gravitropism . these phenotypes are observed also in the overproducing mutants of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . the overproducing mutants reveal additional morphological phenotypes including dwarfism male gametophyte sterility and abnormal floral organs . taken together this evidence indicates that imbalanced _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ impairs endomembrane homeostasis including endocytosis _LOCATION_ formation and _LOCATION_ acidification which causes pleiotropic developmental phenotypes mostly related to the auxin signaling in arabidopsis .
in fission yeast _PROTEIN_ gene encodes kinase known as . the _PROTEIN_ mutant in fission yeast shows an aberrant swollen _LOCATION_ phenotype resembling that of yeast . arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ share amino acid sequence homology with . to test whether _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ have an ability to function as kinase in fission yeast we _PROTEIN_ arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in the _PROTEIN_ mutant under control of the fission yeast nmt promoter . the wild type cell transformed empty vector had many small _LOCATION_ but the _PROTEIN_ cell transformed empty vector had a few enlarged _LOCATION_ . _PROTEIN_ on was introduced into _PROTEIN_ cells . when _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ under control of the thiamine repressible _PROTEIN_ promoter in in the _PROTEIN_ mutant the morphology of the _LOCATION_ changed from an enlarged shape to normal small _LOCATION_ like those in wild type cells . the _PROTEIN_ cells conditionally _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ also had small _LOCATION_ similar to those in wild type although _PROTEIN_ cells which repress _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ by adding thiamine had abnormal enlarged _LOCATION_ . when c terminal _METHOD_ fused _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ cells the enlarged _LOCATION_ morphology of _PROTEIN_ cells changed to small _LOCATION_ like those observed in wild type cells indicating that both _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fully complemented the _PROTEIN_ phenotype of the _LOCATION_ morphology . the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ of these fusion proteins was merged completely with labeled fragmented _LOCATION_ indicating that ectopically _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ localized on the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ of fission yeast . these data illustrate that arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ function as ptdins kinase in fission yeast . to determine the subcellular localizations of _PROTEIN_ proteins we generated transgenic arabidopsis plants _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fused _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ under control of their native promoters . then we observed the subcellular localizations of these proteins in root cells . in epidermal cells in the root differentiation zone the _METHOD_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ localized to punctate structures throughout the _LOCATION_ . most of these punctate structures overlapped with labeled endosomal compartments implying that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ localized to the endosomes of root epidermal cells . in addition _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ exhibited identical localization patterns to those of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . these data revealed that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ localize to the endosomes in arabidopsis root epidermal cells . in the previous study the functions of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ genes were analyzed using the t dna insertional mutation lines of both genes in arabidopsis . although genetic transmission analysis revealed a failure in generating the double mutant lines because of inviability of the pollens carrying mutations in both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ genes the single homozygous mutants of both genes exhibited a weak morphological phenotype in which the leaves are curled slightly . to examine the physiological function of _PROTEIN_ in vegetative tissues we generated conditional knockdown mutant plants using the amirna technique . amirnas which are normally absent in plants are artificially designed mer single stranded rnas . the amirnas specifically down regulate not only a single target but also multiple protein coding genes having similar sequences . we computed optimal amirna sequences for only attenuating _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ simultaneously using software . the target amirna sequences were introduced into the vector which can induce the gene _PROTEIN_ under control of the artificial estradiol inducible promoter . the amirna transgenic lines were grown for d on one half strength murashige and skoog agar plates in the presence or absence of estradiol . then the root lengths were measured . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ transcripts in the transgenic plants grown in the presence of estradiol was confirmed using semiquantitative reverse transcription pcr . in the presence of estradiol the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were attenuated in transgenic lines and . particularly the _PROTEIN_ levels of both genes were strongly inhibited in line . in the presence of estradiol the root lengths in lines and were considerably shortened . in particular the root growth inhibition in the presence of estradiol was significant in line suggesting that the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ correlated with the root growth inhibition in an _PROTEIN_ dose dependent manner in arabidopsis . the lengths of root hairs in line were also shortened considerably compared with the uninduced condition . no growth inhibitions of root and root hair were observed in the control plant which exogenously _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in the presence of estradiol . to elucidate the effect of overexpression of _PROTEIN_ genes in root growth we generated transgenic plants that were able to induce the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ in the presence of estradiol . we chose one overexpression line from each gene and analyzed whether root growth inhibition occurred when each gene was overexpressed . when both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were overexpressed in the presence of estradiol the roots of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plants were shortened considerably indicating that overexpression of _PROTEIN_ created an inhibitory effect on the root elongation similar to that caused by the loss of function of the genes . similar to the case of the knockdown lines the growth inhibition of root hairs in _PROTEIN_ overexpressed or _PROTEIN_ overexpressed plants induced by estradiol was also observed . if the _PROTEIN_ levels of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ affect root elongation then it might be expected that shoot development is also inhibited by overexpression of these genes . to test this possibility the degrees of growth of several constitutive overexpression lines of _PROTEIN_ with various _PROTEIN_ levels were compared . as shown in figure a and b the shoots of the constitutive overexpression lines of _PROTEIN_ were dwarfed increasingly as the _PROTEIN_ level of the gene increased . a similar dwarf phenotype was also observed in constitutive _PROTEIN_ overexpression lines . additionally of the constitutive overexpression lines of _PROTEIN_ five exhibited a sterility phenotype . it was reported previously that crossing the mutant lines of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ produced no homozygous double mutant seeds because of a maturation defect in _PROTEIN_ double homozygous mutant pollens . therefore it is likely that the sterility phenotype of the constitutive overexpression lines of _PROTEIN_ occurred for the same reason . to test the viability of pollen grains we measured the number of living pollen via the fluorescein diacetate _PROTEIN_ staining method in several ox lines with a severe sterile phenotype the _PROTEIN_ levels of these lines were examined using rt pcr . the pollen viability was _PROTEIN_ depending on the _PROTEIN_ level of _PROTEIN_ indicating that overexpression of _PROTEIN_ negatively affected the pollen viability . the viability of pollen of ox was also correlated with the _PROTEIN_ levels of _PROTEIN_ . citation reported that pollens of _PROTEIN_ double homozygous mutant display an abnormal _LOCATION_ phenotype in the _PROTEIN_ pollen development . we examined whether the inviability of pollens in _PROTEIN_ overexpression lines was caused by abnormal _LOCATION_ formation during pollen development by the neutral red staining . after staining the vast majority of pollens had aberrant large _LOCATION_ in both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ overexpression lines although pollen grains from wild type plant showed numerous small _LOCATION_ with uniform sizes indicating that inviability of pollens in the overexpression lines resulted from the _LOCATION_ formation defect that is also observed in _PROTEIN_ double homozygous mutant pollens . typical features of _PROTEIN_ mutants in yeasts and animals are defective in _LOCATION_ acidification fluid phase endocytosis and formation of normal vacular/lysosomal structures . to elucidate whether the cellular phenotypes of knockdown and overexpressing mutants of _PROTEIN_ resemble those in yeast and animal cells we assessed _LOCATION_ acidification and endocytosis using an acidification marker and a _METHOD_ endocytosis marker . results show that conditional knockdowns of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ overexpression of _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ severely impaired the acidification of the central _LOCATION_ compared with noninduced plants . however the punctate structures inside the cells were still acidified in the presence of estradiol in these mutants . probably these punctate structures are the endosomes . endocytosis of was severely delayed in the presence of estradiol . after min labeling _METHOD_ of was observed within the inside of the root cells although these intracellular structures were never observed in the presence of estradiol . after min in the mutant cells the endosomes were labeled but the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ was not labeled yet in the presence of estradiol although the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ of the control cells were fully labeled with the dye . these results show that the cellular phenotypes of arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ mutants are similar to those in other eukaryotic cells . reportedly both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ double homozygous mutant lines revealed a leaf curling phenotype in rosette leaves . this leaf curling phenotype is known as a typical phenotype of the auxin resistant mutants in arabidopsis . therefore we investigated whether the _PROTEIN_ knockdown and overexpression mutants can be expected to alter the sensitivity to exogenous auxin . first we investigated auxin dependent _PROTEIN_ root formation in these mutants which is a typical auxin responsive phenotype in arabidopsis . the d old seedlings grown on one half strength murashige and skoog agar plate were transferred on one half strength murashige and skoog plates with or without dichlorophenoxyacetic acid . after day five the numbers of _PROTEIN_ roots of the mutants were counted . in the absence of estradiol the _PROTEIN_ roots of the amirna plant increased when d was added to the medium indicating that the transgenic plant is sensitive to auxin when the gene _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ were not inhibited . however in the presence of estradiol the addition of d did not produce additional _PROTEIN_ roots indicating that sensitivity to auxin in this line _PROTEIN_ strongly when the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ were inhibited . similarly in the presence of estradiol the induction of the _PROTEIN_ roots in the _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ overexpression lines was reduced significantly with the addition of d implying that each overexpression line became less sensitive to auxin . the induction of the _PROTEIN_ roots in the mock control the inducible _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ line _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ with d was unaffected by the presence of estradiol . next we tested whether the root gravitropic response was changed when the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were increased or _PROTEIN_ conditionally . the transgenic plants were grown on horizontal one half strength murashige and skoog plates with or without estradiol then the plates were rotated . their angle realignments were measured after h. in the amirna lines treatment with estradiol interfered strongly with the gravitropic response particularly the gravitropic response in line was severely impaired suggesting that root gravitropism is inhibited dose dependently . similarly conditional overexpression lines of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ revealed the root gravitropic phenotype in the presence of estradiol . from these data we concluded that auxin signaling is inhibited in both the loss of function and gain of function mutations in _PROTEIN_ . the constitutive overexpression lines of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ showed abnormal phenotypes in flower and leaf organ morphology . the phenotypes were categorized into six typical types based on morphology including an ovule like structure that appeared inside of a curled sepal sepals with a carpel like structure ovule like structures in a curled leaf a stamen fused to the sepal papilla that emerged on the tip of the stamen and three flowers branching from a single place . the abnormal morphology in flowers of ox lines resembled that in the ox lines . these floral phenotypes suggest that floral organ identity genes might be misregulated dose dependently in the _PROTEIN_ gain of function mutants .
