the arabidopsis thaliana wall associated kinases bind to pectin with an _LOCATION_ domain and also contain a cytoplasmic protein kinase domain . waks are required for cell elongation and modulate sugar metabolism . this work shows that in leaf protoplasts a _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein accumulates in a cytoplasmic compartment that contains pectin . the wak compartment contains markers for the _LOCATION_ the site of pectin synthesis . the migration of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ to the cell surface is far slower than that of a cell surface receptor not associated with the cell wall is influenced by the presence of fucose side chains on one or more unidentified molecules that might include pectin and is dependent upon cellulose synthesis on the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . wak is crosslinked into a detergent insoluble complex within the cytoplasmic compartment before it appears on the cell surface and this is independent of fucose modification or cellulose synthesis . thus the assembly and crosslinking of waks may begin at an early stage within a cytoplasmic compartment rather than in the cell wall itself and is coordinated with synthesis of surface cellulose .
to follow the biogenesis of waks a _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein driven by the camv promoter was transiently _PROTEIN_ in mesophyll protoplasts isolated from wild type arabidopsis leaves . the promoter was used because the _PROTEIN_ promoter did not provide sufficient _PROTEIN_ to allow detection of the _METHOD_ fusion protein . _METHOD_ was visualized by confocal laser scanning microscopy . considerable variation in the size and position of the _LOCATION_ made it necessary to look at multiple cross sections of each and of many cells to determine whether _METHOD_ was on cytoplasmic compartments or on the cell surface . some variation in the amount of _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein was seen between cells but the patterns of localization varied only with time . representative cells are shown in fig . and quantitation of the localization in fig . . within hours _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was detected in a compartment within the protoplasts but no _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was seen on the cell surface _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . the size of the compartments varied considerably and only in larger ones could it be seen easily that wak was on their surface _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . by contrast a _METHOD_ fusion protein of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ a receptor involved in brassinosteroid signaling and one not associated with the cell wall was detected on the surface within hours of synthesis when driven by the same camv promoter _METHOD_ . _PROTEIN_ levels of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and bak _METHOD_ fusion constructs appeared to be similar based on the level of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . if the transformed protoplasts were incubated for days wak _METHOD_ was detected on the surface but also in internal compartments . by day most but not all _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was on the cell periphery and surface . a wak _METHOD_ fusion protein that contained the protein kinase domain transmembrane domains and signal sequence but lacked all of the _LOCATION_ domain appeared on the surface of protoplasts within day . this is similar to bak _METHOD_ and indicates that the delay of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ depends upon the wak _LOCATION_ domain . to quantify the location of wak _METHOD_ in protoplasts an entirely cytoplasmic localization of the _METHOD_ signal scored a localization at the surface only scored and cells showing a mix of either localization were given a value between and . the results shown in fig . indicate that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ first accumulates in a cytoplasmic compartment and then appears on the surface far slower than bak _METHOD_ and far slower than expected . reverse transcriptase pcr was used to determine when the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion gene was _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ mrna was detected within hours after transformation . _PROTEIN_ increases at day and is then greatly reduced by day . by day no rna is detected . thus the wak _METHOD_ signal detected by microscopy at day must be the same protein that was detected at day in internal compartments but had by day moved from the interior to the surface . wak is associated with pectin in the cell wall and also in plant extracts and in vitro its binding to pectin is enhanced by . to determine when wak might associate with pectin protoplasts transformed with wak _METHOD_ were fixed and probed with anti pectin serum that recognizes homogalacturonan the most abundant pectic glycan . fig . shows an optical section of a protoplast not transformed with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ but stained with alone . pectin is seen in multiple small cytoplasmic compartments _METHOD_ . cells transformed with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ for hours and stained with are shown in fig . where images of the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ or merged _METHOD_ _METHOD_ signals are presented . this single cross section of the double labeled cell shows that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ is on the surface of compartments that contain pectin and these compartments have a varied surface contour . bak _METHOD_ transformed cells were also stained with at hours post transformation such that _PROTEIN_ protein would be found within the endomembrane system similar to _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . fig . shows that the vesicles containing bak _METHOD_ are mostly distinct from those staining heavily with _METHOD_ . thus _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ accumulates at the same sites as pectin but not all areas that have pectin contain _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . these results also indicate that the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ is inducing the formation of the _PROTEIN_ compartments . pectin is thought to be synthesized in the _LOCATION_ . it was of interest to determine in what type of compartment wak accumulates before being placed on the surface . to identify this compartment protoplasts were transformed with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and with a red _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ fusion to a protein whose cellular location is known . confocal microscopy of _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ was used to localize the signals and the results are shown in fig . . the _LOCATION_ protein _PROTEIN_ has been shown to enter the _LOCATION_ and then to accumulate in the protein storage _LOCATION_ . thirty six hours post transformation the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion protein shows distinctly different localization compared with that of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . in a few cells some overlap was seen but this probably reflects the passage of both proteins through the _LOCATION_ . a mutant of tonoplast intrinsic protein that lacks the psv targeting sequence is thought to pass through the _LOCATION_ and then directly to the lytic and central _LOCATION_ . an _METHOD_ fusion of this was co transformed with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and the results are shown in fig . . the _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ signals appear in distinct locations suggesting that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ does not accumulate in the lytic and central _LOCATION_ . there is a small amount of overlap in these signals that might represent _LOCATION_ colocalization or indeed a small amount of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ that is sent to the lytic _LOCATION_ . _PROTEIN_ passes from the _LOCATION_ to a variety of endosomes and there is some but mostly no overlap between _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . colocalization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ is seen with two _LOCATION_ markers _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . single channel emissions used to create the merged images are shown to the left of the merged images . these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ is associated with the _LOCATION_ and not the _LOCATION_ sorting pathway . while wak is not in the endosome we wished to determine whether the _PROTEIN_ compartment contained _LOCATION_ that had recently undergone endocytosis from the cell surface . therefore cells were incubated with which rapidly labels the surface of a variety of cells and is subsequently incorporated by endocytosis into internal organelles . no colocalization of and wak _METHOD_ was detected . thus it is unlikely that wak _METHOD_ accumulates in the endomembrane system by retrieval from the cell surface . protoplasts are created by digestion of the cell wall with multiple enzymes and hence many of the cell wall components are fragmented or lost . however protoplasts do synthesize a new cell wall and this was observed by calcofluor staining of cellulose and by conventional _METHOD_ microscopy . for cell walls to be regenerated within a few days cells must be placed in regeneration medium . at hour post transformation protoplasts have little to no calcofluor staining and no detectable _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . blue calcofluor staining increased dramatically over a day period and was inhibited by the cellulose synthase specific inhibitor isoxaben . thus the appearance of _PROTEIN_ on the surface of cells correlated with the concurrent regeneration of the cell wall . to determine whether the movement of _PROTEIN_ to the surface requires concurrent cellulose synthesis protoplasts transformed with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were treated with isoxaben . representative transformed cells are shown in fig . and quantitation of the population in fig . . inhibition of cellulose synthesis delays movement of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ to the surface even after five days and protoplasts accumulate _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ within the endo _LOCATION_ system . isoxaben does not affect the rapid movement of bak _METHOD_ to the surface indicating that the observed drug effect is specific to a cell wall associated receptor . waks in plant tissue have only been detected in the cell wall and appear to be crosslinked in a triton x insoluble complex containing pectin . to determine whether the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in protoplasts was becoming crosslinked and hence detergent insoluble the protoplasts were lysed and separated into a triton x soluble and insoluble fraction . the fractions were analyzed by denaturing gel electrophoresis and western blotting with anti _METHOD_ serum . the fusion protein was detected in the triton soluble fraction at day but accumulated into the triton insoluble fraction by day . however the serum and hence the signal was weak and therefore a _PROTEIN_ tap fusion construct was transformed into protoplasts the peroxidase antiperoxidase _PROTEIN_ soluble complex was used to follow the tap tag and fusion protein . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was also transformed at the same time and used to visually follow the location of _PROTEIN_ in the cell . at day _PROTEIN_ tap was detected in the triton soluble fraction consistent with its location within the endo _LOCATION_ system indicated by microscopy . relatively low signal intensity was detected in the insoluble pellet . after and days post transformation increasingly less _PROTEIN_ tap was detected in the soluble fraction and little was detected to enter the gel in the insoluble fraction . to determine whether the _PROTEIN_ tap was still present in the cell the protoplast extracts were slot blotted rather than run on a denaturing gel and _PROTEIN_ tap was indeed detected . thus _PROTEIN_ protein was still present but not in a detergent soluble form . cells _PROTEIN_ only _METHOD_ did not contain a protein that reacted with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . since microscopy indicated at day that there was still a significant amount of wak within the endo _LOCATION_ system _PROTEIN_ must have moved into the insoluble material within the cell . these results indicate that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ a complex within the endo _LOCATION_ system before it is exported to the cell surface . since the transport of _PROTEIN_ to the cell surface may require concurrent cellulose synthesis it was of interest to know if the inhibition of cellulose synthesis would affect the solubility of _PROTEIN_ . fig . shows the triton soluble fraction of cells and days post transformation run in an _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and probed for _PROTEIN_ tap . in a separate experiment the triton x supernatant and pellet were slot blotted and probed for _PROTEIN_ tap . the results indicate that in isoxaben treated protoplasts _PROTEIN_ tap still moves into the insoluble fraction at days post transformation . thus the complex _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ within the cell does not require concurrent cellulose synthesis . the _PROTEIN_ mutation of arabidopsis inhibits the addition of fucose residues to numerous proteins and _PROTEIN_ polymers including pectic rhamnogalacturonan ii this _PROTEIN_ pectin crosslinking . high concentrations of boron in the cell wall can crosslink pectin monomers and to a lesser extent promote fucose deficient rg ii crosslinking . indeed plants homozygous for the _PROTEIN_ allele are dwarf in boron deficient soil but are rescued by exogenous addition of boron . since of the cellular boron is in the cell wall and far less is concentrated within the cell it is likely that rg ii in _PROTEIN_ cytoplasmic compartments is not crosslinked by boron whereas in wild type cells rg ii crosslinking requires less boron and thus may be crosslinked in cytoplasmic compartments . however whereas the enzymes responsible for pectin synthesis reside in the _LOCATION_ the location within the cell of the pectin crosslinking and binding to other wall components is not known . to investigate the relationship between rg ii and wak biogenesis protoplasts from plants homozygous for _PROTEIN_ were transformed with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and visualized by confocal microscopy . surprisingly _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ reached the surface of _PROTEIN_ protoplasts within day post transformation _PROTEIN_ whereas _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in wild type protoplasts remained within cytoplasmic compartments . these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ movement to the cell surface is delayed in the endomembrane system of wild type cells owing to a binding event that requires one or more fucosyl residues in a required glycan or glycoconjugate . although it is tempting to speculate that the retention is due to a fucose dependent crosslinked rgii numerous other molecules such as _PROTEIN_ xyloglucan and n linked glycans are also not fucosylated in this mutant . thus it remains possible that wak is influenced by these changes rather than by the change in rg ii . the _PROTEIN_ mutation does not however change the movement of _PROTEIN_ into the triton x insoluble fraction as compared with wild type cells because days after transformation little _PROTEIN_ tap is detected in the triton x soluble fraction but far more can be found in the triton x insoluble pellet in slot blots . thus fucosylation of an as yet unidentified molecule that influences the rate at which wak reaches the cell surface is not required for the formation of the triton insoluble fraction . furthermore if _PROTEIN_ protoplasts that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ are treated with isoxaben the export of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ is delayed relative to non treated cells _PROTEIN_ and this is similar to wild type protoplasts . despite this transport delay isoxaben does not alter the time at which _PROTEIN_ tap becomes insoluble in _PROTEIN_ or in wild type cells . this indicates that the requirement of cellulose synthesis for _PROTEIN_ transport does not depend upon fucose addition to any molecules and thus perhaps pectin crosslinking within the endomembrane system . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ accumulates in cytoplasmic compartments in protoplasts but it was not clear whether this is representative of events that occur in intact plants . the presence of these wak compartments depends on _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in protoplasts but overexpression of other receptor _METHOD_ fusion constructs does not induce the formation of these bodies . antibodies against wak only detect protein at the surface of plant cells indicating not surprisingly that in plants insufficient material is synthesized to accumulate or to be detected in the endomembrane system . arabidopsis was therefore transformed with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and the and generations were selected for co transformation with the hygromycin marker . hygromycin resistant seedlings were screened for _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . most transformants did not _PROTEIN_ detectable levels of _METHOD_ indicating that the gene is silenced . indeed no _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ mrna is detected in mature leaves . in several plants out of hundreds however _METHOD_ was detected in rapidly growing and expanding leaf buds . fig . shows a confocal section though a leaf bud where _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ is seen in multiple large bodies within cells . these compartments are irregular in shape and size . in expanded leaves of the same plant _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ can still be detected in the periphery of each cell but not in older tissue . these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ does indeed accumulate in endomembranes in plants and that this protein becomes part of the cell wall . since the cytoplasmic compartments are so transient and the signal is lost in older cells the true nature of the association of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ with the cell wall can not be verified at present .
plants were grown under alternating light conditions hours in the light and hours in the dark at humidity . of protoplasts were transformed with of the appropriate plasmids as described by sheen et al . . protoplasts were incubated in medium containing mm nacl mm mm kcl and mm mes koh for day then transferred to cell wall regeneration medium containing m _PROTEIN_ m mannitol g l gamborg 's basal salts with vitamins indolacetic acid and adjusted to ph to promote growth of the cell wall . the _PROTEIN_ coding region was amplified with pfu dna polymerase from arabidopsis thaliana genomic dna and cloned into the ncoi spei site of in frame with the c terminal _METHOD_ . for the _PROTEIN_ tap _PROTEIN_ construct a kb saci spei fragment of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ containing the promoter and the _PROTEIN_ coding sequence was ligated with a kb spei hindiii fragment of ctapi vector containing the tap tag sequence and the terminator and cloned into saci hindiii site of pbluescript sk . _METHOD_ gene fusions were created by inserting the bamhi xhoi fragment containing _METHOD_ from _METHOD_ fusion _PROTEIN_ into the appropriate sites of the _METHOD_ fusion clones jr and . wakfin _METHOD_ pcr was used to amplify the n terminal amino acids of _PROTEIN_ and the aa long transmembrane domain inserting a xbai and spei site . these were ligated and used to replace the ncoi spei fragment of _METHOD_ thereby creating a wak _METHOD_ that contained a signal peptide but lacked the _LOCATION_ domain . a wak specific forward primer gcgaaaccagtagcagcattggctatg and a _METHOD_ specific reverse primer _PROTEIN_ were used to amplify rna from transformed cells with a reverse transcriptase pcr kit from promega . rna was isolated according to wagner and kohorn . transformed protoplasts were pelleted by centrifugation at g for minutes and resuspended in of or rm . a aliquot was withdrawn and saved as a sample for total protein . the remaining were mixed with of buffer containing mm tris hcl mm edta mm nacl and triton x . the mixture was incubated on ice for minutes centrifuged at g for minutes at and the supernatant was taken as a triton soluble fraction . the pellet was resuspended in the same volume as the supernatant and the samples were mixed with an equal volume of sample loading buffer _PROTEIN_ and boiled for minutes . aliquots of total protein samples were slot blotted onto nitrocellulose _LOCATION_ . aliquots of the samples for the triton soluble fraction were separated by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ using gel and transferred onto nitrocellulose _LOCATION_ . the blots were blocked with non fat dry milk in tris buffered saline supplemented with tween probed with peroxidase antiperoxidase _PROTEIN_ soluble complex at dilution for hours or overnight and the signal was detected by chemiluminescence . immunodetection in protoplasts was done as described in fisher and cyr . rat and anti rat were used at . live cells were visualized using a objective with a zeiss meta confocal laser scanning microscope and optical sections were analyzed with zeiss software . multi tracking where each scan was performed with individual laser excitation and emission was used for colocalization studies . location of _METHOD_ in the cell was determined in a blind assay where individual pictures were assigned cytoplasmic to surface identity on a scale of and the average and standard deviation was calculated for each cell type . cells were imaged with a olympus _METHOD_ microscope under a objective . calcofluor was visualized and images were captured with a q imaging retigarx digital camera using open lab software .
