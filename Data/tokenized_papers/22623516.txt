strigolactones are carotenoid derived plant hormones that regulate shoot branching secondary growth root development and responses to soil phosphate . in arabidopsis sl biosynthesis requires the sequential action of two carotenoid cleavage dioxygenases more axillary _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ followed by a cytochrome _PROTEIN_ . in rice the _LOCATION_ localized protein is also necessary for sl biosynthesis but the equivalent gene in arabidopsis has not been identified . here we use phylogenetic analysis of _PROTEIN_ like sequences from photosynthetic _METHOD_ to identify _PROTEIN_ the likely arabidopsis ortholog of . using reverse genetics we show that _PROTEIN_ is required for the inhibition of secondary bud outgrowth and that exogenous application of the synthetic sl _PROTEIN_ can rescue the increased branching phenotype of an _PROTEIN_ mutant . furthermore we use grafting to demonstrate that _PROTEIN_ operates on a nonmobile precursor upstream of _PROTEIN_ in the sl biosynthesis pathway . consistent with the _LOCATION_ localization of we also show that _PROTEIN_ possesses a functional _LOCATION_ transit peptide . we demonstrate that _PROTEIN_ transcripts are subject to both local feedback and auxin dependent signals albeit to a lesser extent than _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ suggesting that early steps in sl biosynthesis are coregulated at the transcriptional level . by identifying an additional component of the canonical sl biosynthesis pathway in arabidopsis we provide a new tool to investigate the regulation of shoot branching and other sl dependent developmental processes .
the arabidopsis genome encodes three proteins with superficial similarity to rice . to identify the likely ortholog of we performed a phylogenetic analysis of _PROTEIN_ like proteins from land plants green algae and cyanobacteria . the eukaryotic sequences broadly grouped into three distinct clades two of which only contained representatives from land plants while the third also contained members from chlorophyte algae and _METHOD_ . with three cyanobacterial proteins serving as an outgroup the phylogeny suggests that there was a single _PROTEIN_ like gene copy in the common ancestor of the chlorophyte algae and the land plants . subsequently the first of two gene duplication events took place in the lineage leading to the land plants giving rise to clades and . the long branches within clade indicative of long periods of sequence divergence further suggest that this group of proteins arose prior to and is functionally distinct from clades and . intriguingly several gene duplication events have occurred independently within the individual algal lineages leading to extensive paralogy within clade . the clades specific to land plants clades and both had strong bayesian posterior support and the two groups together formed a superclade that was also strongly supported . clades and each contained a representative sequence from the moss physcomitrella patens indicating that each group derived from a second gene duplication event that occurred during the early evolution of the land plants . clade contained its ortholog in medicago truncatula and an arabidopsis protein encoded by _GENE_ . notably two other arabidopsis proteins with similarity to encoded by _GENE_ and unambiguously were assigned to clades and respectively . thus we concluded that _GENE_ is the likely arabidopsis ortholog of . nevertheless the presence of other _PROTEIN_ like proteins in land plant genomes is indicative of potential genetic redundancy . the _PROTEIN_ transcript comprises seven exons and the exon length and structure are highly conserved with the and mrnas further supporting orthology between the three genes . the _PROTEIN_ protein is predicted to be amino acids long and shares pairwise identity with _LOCATION_ . at present the _PROTEIN_ protein family does not possess any annotated interpro domains and belongs to a domain of unknown function family _PROTEIN_ of eukaryotic and eubacterial sequences which are widely represented in figure . however the rice _PROTEIN_ protein binds a nonheme iron cofactor which presumably is required for redox based activity as a carotene isomerase . a search of available germplasm collections for mutations in _PROTEIN_ revealed three possible t dna insertion alleles among the gabi kat collection . of these two were confirmed to carry a t dna insertion within the _GENE_ locus . a t dna copy resides within the fifth exon in _PROTEIN_ and in the seventh exon in _PROTEIN_ . reverse transcription pcr analysis showed that both alleles result in the accumulation of incomplete _PROTEIN_ transcripts consistent with the predicted t dna location . however only one of these two alleles resulted in a clear mutant phenotype in plants homozygous for the _PROTEIN_ insertion adult plants exhibited a substantial increase in axillary rosette branches relative to wild type controls while _PROTEIN_ homozygotes had a normal branching pattern . on the basis of its mutant phenotype we named the _PROTEIN_ allele . the t dna insertion in disrupts the predicted protein at leu comparable to the nonfunctional protein produced in which is disrupted after gly . these data suggest that _PROTEIN_ is necessary for the regulation of axillary bud outgrowth and that the extreme end of the transcript is nonessential for the function of the resulting protein . to confirm that the lesion was responsible for the increased branching phenotype we complemented the mutant with a cdna encoding the predicted _PROTEIN_ protein _PROTEIN_ under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus promoter . we isolated four independent transgenic lines in which the transgene segregated in a ratio consistent with a single mendelian locus and was _PROTEIN_ approximately fold higher than in the wild type at the transcriptional level . in all four lines the number of axillary branches and overall plant height were not significantly different from wild type levels fully complementing the phenotype . we performed feeding experiments with _PROTEIN_ a synthetic sl to evaluate whether the increased branching phenotype of likely results from impaired sl biosynthesis as is the case in rice . when grown in culture vessels on medium containing _PROTEIN_ plants produced significantly fewer branches than those grown on control medium . the sl deficient mutant _PROTEIN_ exhibited a similar response although its branching phenotype was more severe . in contrast the sl insensitive mutant showed no response at all to _PROTEIN_ as demonstrated previously . a similar response to _PROTEIN_ was seen with and _PROTEIN_ plants grown hydroponically . together these data demonstrate that _PROTEIN_ is essential for the regulation of axillary branching and that branching inhibition in is limited by sl content rather than sl response . grafting wild type rootstocks to _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ scions restores a wild type branching pattern to the mutant shoots . this outcome results from the graft transmission of root synthesized sl to the shoot presumably via the transpiration stream . conversely grafting with these lines shows that sl biosynthesis also occurs in the shoot as wild type shoots have wild type branching phenotypes even where grafted with mutant rootstocks . to verify that shoots are similarly responsive to a graft transmissible signal we generated reciprocal grafts between wild type ecotype columbia and and found that wild type rootstocks could suppress the increased branching phenotype of shoots . a mutant rootstock had no effect on the phenotype of a wild type shoot showing that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in the shoot is sufficient to inhibit branching . it has been shown previously that _PROTEIN_ operates downstream of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in sl biosynthesis because a _PROTEIN_ rootstock can restore a wild type branching pattern to _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ shoots but not vice versa . these findings have also demonstrated that a compound intermediate between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ is subject to long distance transport from the root to the shoot . likewise the substrates of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are nonmobile _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ because a _PROTEIN_ rootstock fails to complement a _PROTEIN_ shoot and vice versa . to investigate the relative position of _PROTEIN_ within the max pathway we generated reciprocal grafts between and either _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ . a _PROTEIN_ rootstock was able to fully restore the branching phenotype of a shoot demonstrating that _PROTEIN_ operates downstream of _PROTEIN_ . interestingly as for _PROTEIN_ discussed below the branching of _PROTEIN_ scions grafted to rootstocks was reduced to that of self grafts . this suggests that may generate a small amount of sl or a substance that can partly compensate for sl deficiency and is consistent with the relatively mild branching phenotype of compared with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . in contrast to graft combinations involving with the wild type or _PROTEIN_ reciprocal grafts between and _PROTEIN_ failed to restore branching to wild type levels in either mutant shoot . this situation is similar to grafts between the carotenoid cleavage dioxygenase mutants of arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and pea _METHOD_ _METHOD_ which unlike grafts with wild type partners are unable to show branching inhibition . as discussed below this is consistent with _PROTEIN_ acting in the _LOCATION_ on a _LOCATION_ localized nonmobile substrate . unlike grafts between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ rootstocks caused a slight enhancement of branching in shoots and rootstocks caused a slight reduction of branching in _PROTEIN_ shoots . as has an intermediate branching phenotype compared with _PROTEIN_ presumably has elevated graft transmissible hormone content compared with _PROTEIN_ . in summary these grafting data are consistent with _PROTEIN_ functioning upstream of _PROTEIN_ in the biosynthesis of sl . given the apparent nonmobility of the _PROTEIN_ precursor and the biochemical function of _PROTEIN_ it is likely that the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ protein is spatially restricted to the _LOCATION_ . to determine the likely cellular location of _PROTEIN_ we generated a chimeric construct encoding the full length _PROTEIN_ protein fused to the n terminus of _METHOD_ . following transient _PROTEIN_ in onion epidermis the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ fully overlapped with the red _METHOD_ from the coexpressed _LOCATION_ specific marker . no _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was detected beyond the _LOCATION_ suggesting that the full length _PROTEIN_ protein was strictly localized to this organelle . this is in accord with _LOCATION_ localization of . the _PROTEIN_ protein encodes a predicted n terminal _LOCATION_ transit peptide of amino acids . to test whether this presequence is sufficient to direct _LOCATION_ localization we generated a translational fusion between the first amino acids of _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ and subjected onion epidermal cells to transient transformation as before . again the _METHOD_ signals from both the _METHOD_ and the _LOCATION_ specific marker fully overlapped indicating that _PROTEIN_ possesses a bona fide _LOCATION_ transit peptide . together these data suggest that _PROTEIN_ functions in the _LOCATION_ consistent with the demonstrated cellular location of in rice and its anticipated activity on a nonmobile precursor . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ transcript abundance from public microarray data revealed potential differential _PROTEIN_ intensities throughout the plant with a relative deficit of _PROTEIN_ in root tissue . quantitative rt pcr analysis of col tissues confirmed that _PROTEIN_ transcripts were more abundant in shoot tissue than in roots of week old wild type plants while _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ transcripts accumulated most strongly in the hypocotyl and roots . in contrast _PROTEIN_ transcript levels varied little over the tissues examined . consistent with their role in sl response we found that _PROTEIN_ and transcripts were evenly _PROTEIN_ across the shoot hypocotyl and root . differential spatial _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ compared with _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ then led us to investigate whether _PROTEIN_ was under similar feedback control as _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . in all max mutants levels of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ transcripts in the hypocotyl are to fold higher than in the wild type indicative of feedback up regulation . this feedback process is dependent on a combination of auxin and nonauxin signals . sl related auxin responses require the auxin _PROTEIN_ protein as _PROTEIN_ auxin response mutants have reduced _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ transcript levels at least in cauline internodes and hypocotyls of week old plants . in hypocotyls of week old prebolting _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants _PROTEIN_ transcripts were significantly up regulated relative to the wild type . however these changes were typically half the increase observed for _PROTEIN_ transcripts which were over fold and fold up regulated in a _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ background respectively . likewise while _PROTEIN_ transcripts were fold down regulated in _PROTEIN_ mutants _PROTEIN_ transcripts were only moderately less abundant . consequently although the magnitude of _PROTEIN_ changes for _PROTEIN_ are less than for _PROTEIN_ the response is similar and therefore may involve common regulatory components . levels of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ transcripts in the hypocotyl _PROTEIN_ in response to removal of the shoot tip by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ levels . this presumably reduces sl levels in order to allow buds below the decapitation site to grow and compensate for the missing shoot tip . a proportion of the _PROTEIN_ in gene _PROTEIN_ is due to auxin depletion in the hypocotyl after removal of the shoot tip _PROTEIN_ . we checked _PROTEIN_ gene _PROTEIN_ in hypocotyls after various treatments known to modulate auxin content auxin addition decapitation decapitation followed by iaa addition addition of the auxin transport inhibitor n naphthylphthalamic acid and combined addition of iaa and npa . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ showed similar trends to that of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ across these treatments although as above the magnitude of the response was less . classical auxin responsive genes _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ also responded in a similar manner in these samples but with varied magnitudes . the only difference between trends among the treatments for the classical auxin response genes compared with the sl genes was that exogenous iaa added to npa treated plants fully restored and indeed overcompensated for the npa whereas the sl genes were not fully restored back to control levels in this iaa npa treatment . this raises the possibility of auxin and nonauxin effects of npa regulation of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ gene _PROTEIN_ . in pea there is evidence that feedback regulation of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ orthologs can occur over long distances in a graft transmissible and localized manner . in arabidopsis a wild type shoot can suppress the elevated _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in a _PROTEIN_ rootstock indicative of a downwardly mobile feedback signal . nevertheless in arabidopsis the local effect of _PROTEIN_ in the rootstock is greater than that of the long distance signaling from shoots . in similar experiments in pea the effect of the scion appears greater than the local effect of the rootstock . in contrast to sl response mutants grafts between the wild type and sl deficient mutants in pea show a minor effect of the scion on gene _PROTEIN_ in the rootstock possibly due to the restoration of sl content by the wild type graft partner . to investigate the scenario for we analyzed gene _PROTEIN_ in the hypocotyl and rootstock of plants reciprocally grafted with the wild type . in self grafts _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ transcripts were up regulated consistent with feedback . _PROTEIN_ as with wild type rootstocks of pea grafted to mutants in sl biosynthesis _PROTEIN_ in the root was not significantly affected by the genotype of the shoot in either reciprocal graft in arabidopsis . as in pea this may be because wild type rootstocks can restore branching and presumably the long distance feedback signal to normal levels in shoots . notably in grafts involving the three auxin responsive transcripts did not exhibit a statistically significant difference from wild type self grafts suggesting that auxin transport and/or signaling is not substantially affected in mutants . this outcome may be due to the relatively moderate phenotype of .
