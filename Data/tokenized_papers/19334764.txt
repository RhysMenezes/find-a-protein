_LOCATION_ proteins are involved in diverse cellular processes and are an integral component of many signaling cascades but due to their highly hydrophobic nature and the complexities associated with studying these proteins in planta alternative methods are being developed to better characterize these proteins on a proteome wide scale . in our previous work methanol assisted solubilization was determined to facilitate the identification of both hydrophobic and hydrophilic _LOCATION_ proteins compared to brij solubilization and was particularly effective for leucine rich repeat receptor like kinases _PROTEIN_ . to improve peptide identification and to overcome sample losses after tryptic digestion we have developed an effective chloroform extraction method to promote _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ protein identification . the use of chloroform extraction over traditional solid phase extraction prior to off line strong cation exchange liquid chromatography and reversed phase liquid chromatography tandem _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ analysis facilitated the removal of chlorophylls major contaminants of plant tissue preparations that can affect downstream analysis in addition to the effective removal of trypsin used in the digestion . on the basis of a statistically derived false discovery rate the chloroform extraction procedure increased the identification of unique peptides for _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ proteins over spe by which produced nearly a fold increase in detection of _LOCATION_ transporters and lrr _PROTEIN_ without increased identification of contaminating rubisco and ribosomal peptides . overall the combined use of methanol and chloroform provides an effective method to study _LOCATION_ proteins and can be readily applied to other tissues and cells types for proteomic analysis .
comprehensive identification of _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ proteins using bottom up methodologies is an important step for cataloging the location and levels of critical proteins necessary for cellular function . because of the complexities and variation of plants and their tissues alternatives in sample preparation are needed especially if certain classes of proteins are to be targeted . along these lines we previously developed a methanol based procedure for extracting and solubilizing _LOCATION_ proteins from arabidopsis seedlings which was particularly effective for identifying hydrophobic integral _LOCATION_ proteins and lrr _PROTEIN_ in particular as compared to a nonionic detergent approach.citation although the samples were enriched in total _LOCATION_ they still were quite complex prompting the need for further isolating the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . even this additional enrichment produced a sample containing a significant number of chloroplast proteins chlorophyll and other phytochemicals that could not be removed with spe prior to scxc fractionation . to enhance our approach we developed an organic extraction procedure using chloroform to provide for more effective scxc _METHOD_ analysis of _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ proteins . after tissue homogenization and removal of cellular debris a high level of chlorophyll other phytochemicals and lipid based components were present in the sample and remained after tryptic digestion of the proteins . often many of these contaminants are removed during scxc but may lead to alterations in scxc fractionation from one sample to another due to varying levels that may be present in different tissue samples or plants . furthermore these components typically require removal if chemical isotope labeling is to be used for quantitative measurements . to eliminate these contaminants we have determined that the addition of chloroform at a level of of the initial sample volume can be used to effectively extract chlorophyll from the aqueous layer as shown in figure citation . initially the sample was very green in color indicating the presence of chlorophylls . however after extraction with chloroform the aqueous layer appeared clear whereas the lower layer was green and produced a spectrum featuring relative maxima at and nm characteristic of chlorophyll a and at nm indicative of chlorophyll b . other features of the spectrum also suggest the presence of other organic molecules such as other chlorophyll derivatives phytochemicals and lipid based components . to achieve a more effective extraction the sample was vortexed leading to a white precipitant at the interface which was presumed to be proteins that have precipitated under the shearing forces generated by vortexing the sample containing the two immiscible phases . this phenomenon can be used to selectively remove the remaining protease and other undigested protein components from the sample after proteolytic digestion . to test this hypothesis the chloroform extraction procedure was performed on a peptide sample containing trypsin . after tryptic digestion using a methanol based buffer the proteome sample contains about trypsin which can become a problem for reproducible scxc or reversed phase lc due to its high abundance . by the addition of a volume corresponding to chloroform and vortexing the sample trypsin can be effectively removed . this is experimentally demonstrated for a sample containing bsa in mm ammonium bicarbonate buffer ph in which trypsin was added . as shown in figure citationa _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ analysis and _METHOD_ staining indicated that the chloroform extraction was effective for removing trypsin from proteolytic digests in aqueous buffers . however the use of chloroform to remove trypsin from our mm ammonium bicarbonate buffer system did not work using a direct addition of chloroform since it was miscible with the methanol based buffer . to enable the use of chloroform the methanol concentration was lowered to which upon the addition of chloroform and vortexing allowed efficient removal of trypsin from the aqueous phase . this confirmed that most if not all of the trypsin used to digest bsa had been removed and remained in the white interface region . however because of the limits of detection of protein staining there could still be some undetectable trypsin present in the solution . to determine if this was indeed the case we measured the trypsin activity remaining in the aqueous layer using the baee assay in which the _PROTEIN_ acid methyl ester is hydrolyzed by trypsin to produce a chromophoric _PROTEIN_ that can be monitored at nm.citation the results of these measurements are shown in figure citationb . _PROTEIN_ of the buffer used the use of the chloroform extraction eliminates all trypsin activity and agrees with the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ analysis . this is an analytical advantage since protease activity can be immediately quenched without the addition of inhibitors that can interfere in downstream analysis . in addition our procedure effectively removed the protease from the aqueous layer enabling direct analysis of the peptides without the concerns of having a highly abundant protease react with isotope coded reagents such as itraq _METHOD_ or digest immobilized antibodies used in affinity chromatography . after demonstrating that the chloroform extraction method was effective in removing phytochemicals as well as undigested protein the next step was to determine whether peptides in the aqueous layer were extracted into the chloroform layer . the experiment conducted used the test peptide ac sysmehfrwgkpv oh which contains a single tryptic cleavage site and represents a typical tryptic peptide from a proteolytic digestion used in a bottom up approach . solutions containing the test peptide in mm ammonium bicarbonate and mm ammonium bicarbonate were treated with or without trypsin and then subjected to the chloroform extraction procedure . the aqueous layers were analyzed by esi _METHOD_ . in each buffer system before trypsin addition the intact peptide was detected at m/z for the ion and m/z for the ion along with various potassium adducts as shown in figure citationa b . after addition of trypsin the test peptide was cleaved into two distinctive peptides ac sysmehfr oh and wgkpv oh at m/z and for the and ion respectively along with other charge states and adducts as shown in figure citationc d . both buffered solutions produced essentially identical _METHOD_ spectra indicating that the chloroform extraction can be effectively applied to the ammonium bicarbonate buffered solution that contains methanol . the chloroform layer from each extraction was also analyzed by esi _METHOD_ but no peptides were detected indicating that charged peptides do not partition from the bicarbonate buffered solution at ph into the chloroform layer . to demonstrate that the chloroform extraction procedure can be used to remove neutral organic components and undigested proteins from the aqueous buffer to enhance peptide identification and increase proteome coverage we applied this method to the analysis of _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ proteins from arabidopsis seedlings using our previously developed approach of methanol extraction and solubilization of microsomal _LOCATION_ protein fractions.citation the overall method used in our current study also employed phase partitioningcitation to enrich for _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ from the microsomal fraction as outlined in figure citation . after preparation of the _LOCATION_ protein fraction using the methanol approach the sample was divided into equivalent aliquots with one processed by the chloroform extraction procedure and the other with spe . each peptide sample was fractionated by scxc and each collected fraction was analyzed twice by _METHOD_ using two different reversed phase gradients . a _PROTEIN_ was used in our previous study to compare the differences between methanol and brij _LOCATION_ protein solubilization of microsomal fractions from arabidopsis seedlings.citation in the current study two independent _METHOD_ analyses of every scxc fraction were performed for both the chloroform extracted and spe treated samples in order to provide a more consistent data set for comparison . since the _METHOD_ method utilized dda to identify peptides the additional _METHOD_ analysis allowed more unique peptides to be identified and enabled the identification of more proteins with two or more unique peptides . although each sample was prepared with the same amount of peptides each sample was processed with either the chloroform extraction or spe and thus some form of normalization was needed to make a comparison . to accomplish this the _PROTEIN_ threshold values pertaining to each charge state were independently determined for each sample at a _PROTEIN_ and appear in table citation . while the search parameters and dta generation were the same for both data sets the quality of the precursor and product ion spectra depends on the sample preparation and thus at a given xcorr threshold the _PROTEIN_ could be different for each sample . consequently a _PROTEIN_ was applied to each data set and the _PROTEIN_ score threshold values at each charge state were determined . in this manner a more meaningful qualitative comparison between the chloroform extraction and spe methods can be made to reveal the advantages and disadvantages between the two methods to facilitate the identification of _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ proteins . on the basis of the _PROTEIN_ and the _PROTEIN_ protein designations a total of peptides corresponding to unique peptides for an estimated proteins were identified with the chloroform extraction method compared to a total of peptides corresponding to unique peptides for an estimated proteins identified with the spe method . in _METHOD_ of overlap proteins and peptides were common to both methods . in comparison to the spe method which used the same amount of material the chloroform extraction procedure provided an increase of and in the number of peptides unique peptides and proteins identified respectively . this increase at both the peptide and protein level for the chloroform extracted sample is not due to lower xcorr thresholds since they are very similar to those of spe in _PROTEIN_ the average xcorr value for the chloroform extraction was higher for each charge state than that for spe suggesting higher quality product ion spectra . although these xcorr increases are not statistically significant it is important to note that the coefficient of variation is less than across the same charge state for each method indicating that the data sets can be compared and that the measured differences are not simply attributable to unusual xcorr values but are the direct result of the nature of the peptides contained within each sample . to better understand the increases for peptide and protein identifications by _METHOD_ using the chloroform extraction procedure the data were analyzed using several bioinformatic approaches . the first comparison was based on functional classification as determined by _PROTEIN_ as shown in figure citation . the overall composition between the two samples is very similar but when considering differences of at least there is an increase in _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ protein identifications with a concomitant _PROTEIN_ in _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ protein identification in the chloroform extracted sample . to better understand these findings we examined the nature of protein and peptide hydrophobicity specific to each approach using _PROTEIN_ analysis as shown in figure citation . at the protein level the distribution between the chloroform and spe methods was very similar and produced an average protein _PROTEIN_ value of and respectively . when considering just the hydrophilic proteins proteins were unique to the chloroform extraction method and proteins were unique to the spe method each eliciting an average _PROTEIN_ value of and respectively . for the hydrophobic proteins the number of identifications is lower but a difference emerges between the two samples proteins possess an average _PROTEIN_ value of for the chloroform extraction and proteins possess an average _PROTEIN_ value of for spe . the increase in the detection of hydrophobic proteins by the chloroform extraction over spe supports the increase in _LOCATION_ protein detection . at the peptide level the _PROTEIN_ distribution for the peptides obtained only by chloroform extraction has a similar profile as the peptides obtained only by spe but it is dramatically shifted toward the hydrophilic side . the average _PROTEIN_ value for peptides unique to the chloroform extraction and spe methods is and respectively . further analysis revealed that for the chloroform extraction method peptides are hydrophilic and possess an average _PROTEIN_ value of whereas with spe peptides are hydrophilic and have an average _PROTEIN_ value of . in _METHOD_ of the hydrophobic peptides spe has the advantage with peptides which elicit an average _PROTEIN_ value of compared to the chloroform extraction which contained hydrophobic peptides with an average _PROTEIN_ value of . overall the chloroform extraction method resulted in more peptides being identified with a greater percentage being more hydrophilic than those of the spe method . since each sample originated from the same tissue and preparation procedure using methanol assisted solubilization and tryptic digestion the _PROTEIN_ analysis is consistent with peptide losses based on each extraction method . when considering the spe method very hydrophilic peptides may not be retained on column during the loading and/or washing steps prior to elution thus in effect spe depletes hydrophilic peptides relative to the chloroform approach . however an alternative explanation for the enhanced hydrophilicity using the chloroform extraction method is that some of the hydrophobic peptides partition into the chloroform layer during the extraction with the methanol buffer solution after the tryptic digestion . although the presence of methanol could provide a needed _PROTEIN_ protic component to facilitate hydrogen bonding to peptides and thus promote their solubility in the chloroform layer the lack of detection for this phenomenon using our test peptide with a _PROTEIN_ value or its digestion products does not preclude the possibility of extracting very hydrophobic peptides . even if some hydrophobic peptides partition into the chloroform layer this type of extraction is not immediately useful in this current study since a significant amount of phytochemicals would be present in the chloroform layer and thus require removal prior to _METHOD_ analysis thus promoting further peptide losses that would affect detection of these highly hydrophobic peptides . because this study utilized a bottom up proteomics approach protein identification was based on peptide detection but since more hydrophilic peptides were detected with the chloroform extraction method than with spe how does that translate into an increase in _LOCATION_ protein detection and a _PROTEIN_ in _LOCATION_ proteins ? part of this can be attributed to the nature of integral _LOCATION_ proteins which contain various hydrophilic extra and intracellular domains that often comprise the majority of the protein s sequence . these regions provide a higher number of tryptic peptides that can be generated over the number of hydrophobic peptides that span the transmembrane region which in effect increases their probability of being detected by dda based _METHOD_ analysis . when considering all _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ proteins and some important functional classes each method produces an average peptide/protein ratio of around as presented in table citation . when considering the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ proteins there was a increase in the number of peptides identified with the chloroform extraction approach compared to spe which corresponds to a increase in protein identification a trend that was observed for all the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ protein classes and was consistent with the overall detection of more hydrophobic proteins as shown in figure citationa . when considering the highly abundant proteins from plant tissue that are present due to nonspecific binding such as rubisco and ribosomal proteins which represent contaminants present in the enriched _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ each method produces different results . for rubisco chloroform reduces the number of identified peptides by whereas both methods perform similarly for ribosomal protein identification . on the basis of these data chloroform extraction as a cleanup step is a better method for _LOCATION_ protein identification using a bottom up _METHOD_ proteomics approach than spe since it minimizes identification of nonspecific proteins while promoting peptide identification of _LOCATION_ proteins both important aspects for meaningful qualitative and quantitative analysis for _LOCATION_ protein abundance measurements . to understand these ramifications further in a biological context we examined in detail two of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ protein classes transporters and lrr _PROTEIN_ . transporters are highly hydrophobic _LOCATION_ bound proteins involved in the movement of ions small molecules or macromolecules across biological _LOCATION_ . numerous _LOCATION_ transporters were identified by both chloroform extraction and spe methods . on the basis of _PROTEIN_ analysis a total of _LOCATION_ specific transporters were detected with unique peptides using our chloroform extraction method as compared to _LOCATION_ specific transporters identified with unique peptides using the spe method . of the and unique peptides matching to chloroform extraction and spe methods respectively peptides were found to match to multiple proteins but all belonging to the same family of proteins . the implementation of the chloroform extraction basically doubled the coverage of this important highly hydrophobic class of proteins which included some of the major classes of transporters abc transporters _PROTEIN_ aquaporins _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ integral proteins _PROTEIN_ nitrate transporters phosphate transporters and sugar transporters . since both methods produced an average of two unique peptides per protein identification this constraint was used to provide a basis for comparing the transporters between the two methods and the results are presented in table citation . we identified five sucrose transporters with our chloroform extraction method and only one could be identified using the spe method . sugar transporter _PROTEIN_ is an important member of this family with two unique peptides identified for this protein in our chloroform extraction method . in arabidopsis the disaccharide sucrose is transported by members of the sucrose carrier family protein whereas the monosaccharide hexose is transported by members of the sugar transport family protein _PROTEIN_ .citation out of the members in the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ family only _PROTEIN_ has been characterized electrophysiologically and determined to be a proton/monosaccharide symporter.citation phosphoproteomic studies by nuhse et al.citation have also revealed that the protein is serine phosphorylated . using our chloroform extraction method we also identified _PROTEIN_ by two unique peptides which are highly hydrophobic _LOCATION_ carriers with tmds . arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ is highly _PROTEIN_ in pollen trichomes and roots and has been recently shown to be important for sugar signaling in vegetative tissue as well as for normal male gametophyte functioncitation and suc dependent signal transduction leads to anthocyanin accumulation . the nitrate transporter is a highly hydrophobic _LOCATION_ transporter with tmds and was only identified using our chloroform extraction method by two unique peptides . although phosphate hexose sugar and zinc transporters have been identified in other proteomic studies by nuhse et al.citation and marmagne et al. citation identification of _PROTEIN_ was unique to our study . two gene families _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ have been identified in arabidopsis that potentially encode transporters responsible for nitrate uptake by roots or distribution within the plant.citation the _PROTEIN_ family of proteins transport many nitrogen containing substrates including a dicarboxylate.citation another class of highly hydrophobic _LOCATION_ proteins was identified in our study and was common to both the extraction methods . phosphate transporters play an active role in phosphate uptake from the soil and involve members in the family . identified in our study contains tmds interrupted by a large hydrophilic loop between and . functional analysis of indicated that it is a proton/phosphate symporter dependent on the electrochemical gradient across the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ identification of this protein by the chloroform extraction method promoted the detection of peptides _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ nathevfr in which each c terminal portion is part of and respectively . this illustrates the ability of the methanol bicarbonate buffer to extract integral _LOCATION_ proteins from the lipid bilayer to facilitate solubilization and denaturation so that trypsin can cleave within a tmd region . in our previous study using the methanol approach to solubilize _LOCATION_ proteins in microsomal fractions citation we identified _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ two integral _LOCATION_ proteins from the _PROTEIN_ binding cassette family of transporters . in the present study using the effective methanol solubilization and digestion technique of _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ enriched samples combined with chloroform extraction we were able to identify abc transporters belonging to three different families multidrug resistance proteins multidrug associated proteins and pleiotropic drug resistance protein . the pdr family is unusual in that it is only found in fungi and plants.citation in our study of _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ we found _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ from the pdr family and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ from the mdr family with both single peptide matches and multiple peptide matches suggesting that members of both pdr and mdr families of abc transporters are _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ bound which is consistent with other experimental studies employing both experimental and bioinformatic approaches.citation these findings exemplify the advantage of our chloroform extraction method by noting that in previous arabidopsis proteomic studies by nuhse et al.citation and alexandersson et al.citation only one family member _PROTEIN_ was identified . we also identified multiple unique peptides of a peroxisomal abc transporter _PROTEIN_ and another abc family protein _GENE_ identical to white brown complex homologue protein both of which were not reported in previous _LOCATION_ proteomic studies . _PROTEIN_ protein promotes germination and represses embryo dormancy whereas has been shown to play a major role in the transportation of monolignols as glycosides into the _LOCATION_ space.citation in animals fungi and plants _PROTEIN_ are involved in the regulation of _LOCATION_ calcium concentration.citation our _LOCATION_ proteomic analysis identified proteins belonging to the calcium transporting _PROTEIN_ family of proteins with multiple peptide identifications . of the _PROTEIN_ identified in our study only two of them _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ have been previously reported by proteomic analysis.citation _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were identified by both methods whereas _PROTEIN_ was specific to the spe method and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were identified by the chloroform extraction method clearly demonstrating once again that the chloroform extraction approach has distinct advantages over the spe method . while the localization of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ has been reported to be in the chloroplast inner envelope and _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ respectively the localization of other acas obtained in the present study suggest that a number of these proteins reside in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . the efficacy of using chloroform extraction to promote identification of _LOCATION_ proteins over spe is illustrated for one of the abc transporters _PROTEIN_ . the extent of sequence coverage obtained by the identification of and distinct peptides using the spe and chloroform extraction methods respectively is shown in figure citation . the significant increase in sequence coverage afforded by the chloroform extraction approach is due to the enhanced detection of hydrophilic peptides and is consistent with the trend observed when considering the peptide _PROTEIN_ distribution presented in figure citation . moreover out of the peptides _PROTEIN_ identified by spe were also detected with the chloroform extraction approach . although an increase in hydrophilic peptide identification occurs detection of hydrophobic peptides is not precluded by the chloroform extraction since the peptide gvtgafrpgvltalm gvsgagk which is essentially of _PROTEIN_ was identified using the chloroform extraction method but not by spe . by enhancing detection of hydrophilic peptides but not at the expense of hydrophobic peptides the use of chloroform extraction provides a means to better characterize integral _LOCATION_ proteins . our interest in plant _LOCATION_ proteomics centers around the functional analysis of components involved in various developmental signaling cascades with a particular focus on lrr _PROTEIN_ . lrr _PROTEIN_ are found widely in plants as multigene families that includes over members in arabidopsis and nearly in rice.citation lrr _PROTEIN_ have an organization of functional domains similar to mammalian receptor tyrosine kinases and transforming growth _PROTEIN_ beta serine/threonine receptor kinases including an _LOCATION_ domain potentially involved in ligand binding and receptor oligomerization a single pass transmembrane sequence and a cytoplasmic kinase domain that propagates the signal downstream in a phosphorylation dependent manner.citation in our present study we identified lrr _PROTEIN_ by the chloroform extraction method and at least by the spe method of which or were found to be common to both methods _PROTEIN_ . one of the well characterized members of the lrr _PROTEIN_ family identified by the chloroform extraction method is somatice embryogenesis receptor kinase associated kinase _PROTEIN_ which plays an important role in steroid hormone mediated signal transductioncitation as well as having independent roles in programmed cell deathcitation and various defense responses.citation with the spe method peptides were identified matching to _PROTEIN_ and other members of the _PROTEIN_ family such as _PROTEIN_ along with the functionally redundant _PROTEIN_ which have been recently reported to play an essential role in tapetum specification and pollen development during male sporogenesis.citation in addition two proteins were detected from the strubellig receptor family _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ that has been proposed to play a role in defense responses against fungi and _PROTEIN_ which may act in primary cell wall biosynthesis.citation we also identified _PROTEIN_ by our spe method which has been implicated in radial pattern formation in early embryos.citation the identified peptide has phosphorylated serine and threonine residues that map to the juxtamembrane region of the kinase domain . transmembrane _PROTEIN_ identified in our study has been cloned and characterized in tobaccocitation and has been found to play a role in plant defense . using the chloroform extraction method we detected barely any _PROTEIN_ which along with other members of the bam receptor family has been determined to regulate peripheral vascular development leaf shape size and symmetry as well as male and female gametophyte development.citation in our previous work citation lrr _PROTEIN_ were identified using a combination of methanol assisted solubilization two phase partitioning and spe which is similar to the lrr _PROTEIN_ we identified in this study using the same spe method . however substituting chloroform extraction for spe increased the number of lrr _PROTEIN_ identified to a total of which compares well to other proteomic studies in which purified _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ were isolated from intact arabidopsis plants . for example alexandersson et al.citation identified lrr _PROTEIN_ in _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ isolated from leaves of arabidopsis plants while nelson et al.citation used purified _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ from whole arabidopsis seedlings grown in shaking liquid culture to identify lrr _PROTEIN_ . interestingly of the lrr _PROTEIN_ identified by our previous methodcitation were also identified by the current chloroform protocol . one of the these lrr _PROTEIN_ _GENE_ has been identified by all of our extraction approaches and was also detected in four other proteomic analyses of the arabidopsis _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ citation suggesting it is either an abundant lrr _PROTEIN_ or one that is easily extracted from the _LOCATION_ . two other lrr _PROTEIN_ _GENE_ and _GENE_ identified in our previous studycitation and our current chloroform protocol were also identified in three other proteomic studies.citation
after seed sterilization arabidopsis thaliana seedlings were grown for days under constant light in liquid shaking culture as previously described.citation methanol chloroform bca assay kit sodium

grade modified trypsin was from promega . microcystin was from emd biosciences inc. and protease inhibitor cocktail tablets were from roche diagnostics . the peptide ac sysmehfrwgkpv oh was from bachem americas inc. . all other chemicals were obtained from thermo fisher or sigma aldrich unless otherwise noted . water was distilled and purified using a high q water purification system . the effectiveness of chloroform in extracting phytochemicals from protein samples prepared from plant tissue was assessed using spectroscopy . a sample of g of arabidopsis seedlings was homogenized in ml of mm and centrifuged at for min to remove cellular debris and the supernatant was transferred to a new ml siliconized microcentrifuge tube . then of chloroform was added to the sample followed by vortexing at medium speed for s. the initial sample the upper aqueous layer and the lower chloroform layer were analyzed by a diode array detector to generate a spectrum from to nm . a dilution was used for all spectrophotometer measurements . the use of chloroform extraction to facilitate the removal of trypsin from the aqueous phase while allowing peptides to remain was established using a model system containing of a test peptide with a single trypsin cleavage site in of mm ammonium bicarbonate ph in a ml siliconized microcentrifuge tube . to this sample of chloroform was added the sample was then vortexed on med/high speed for s and the phases were separated by centrifuging at rpm for min . for tryptic digestion trypsin was added to another sample and was incubated overnight at prior to chloroform extraction . in a third sample the solution contained all of the above components plus methanol . it was observed that chloroform was miscible when added to the mm ammonium bicarbonate buffer used in our previous work.citation with the use of a series of samples containing a reduced amount of methanol it was determined that a composition of methanol would facilitate a distinct two phase system upon chloroform addition as observed for the aqueous samples . once all the samples were subjected to the chloroform extraction the upper and lower layers were removed and transferred into separate siliconized ml microcentrifuge tubes and lyophilized . as a control one sample was treated with of buffer instead of chloroform and the entire sample was lyophilized . for _METHOD_ _METHOD_ analysis each residue was dissolved in of formic acid and then diluted to produce a final peptide concentration of . the samples were infused at a flow rate of into a custom built electrospray interface coupled with an lcq deca ion trap _METHOD_ spectrometer operating in the positive ion mode at an esi voltage of kv . data were acquired in the profile mode for the m/z range for min with the integrated _METHOD_ spectrum used in post acquisition analysis . to determine the extent of trypsin removal from the aqueous sample to the phase interface of the chloroform/aqueous phase system both the quantity and its activity were measured . in one experiment of bsa was treated with of trypsin in either of mm ammonium bicarbonate or mm ammonium bicarbonate and incubated overnight at . both samples were chloroform extracted the sample containing methanol was reduced to methanol by using a stream of nitrogen and each sample was analyzed by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and visualized by _METHOD_ staining . to determine the remaining trypsin activity the hydrolysis of n benzoyl l arginine ethyl ester was measured using a modified version of a previously described assay.citation for these experiments of trypsin was added to of either mm ammonium bicarbonate or mm ammonium bicarbonate and the trypsin activity of the solution was measured before and after chloroform extraction using an agilent diode array spectrophotometer to monitor the absorbance at nm every s for min . for the baee assay a quartz cuvette containing ml of mm tris and mm baee was equilibrated to along with each sample . after subtraction from a reference measurement for the buffer the data acquisition was started to establish the initial baseline . after min of each sample was added to the reaction cuvette and mixed using a stirrer during the interval between measurements . the rate of the reaction was obtained from the linear regression analysis of the absorbance versus time data using the kinetics software of the _METHOD_ program . all experiments were performed in triplicate . the microsomal fractions were isolated from plant tissue as previously describedcitation and then reconstituted in ml of resuspension buffer mm potassium chloride mm edta and inhibitors . to enrich for _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ a peg/dextran phase separation using a polymer composition was implemented.citation the resuspended _LOCATION_ were added to g of an aqueous polymer two phase system containing a final composition of dextran peg mm potassium phosphate ph and mm potassium chloride . _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ were then purified by aqueous polymer two phase partitioning as described previously.citation the final upper phases were diluted at least fold with mm sucrose mm potassium phosphate ph and mm edta . the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ were isolated by ultracentrifugation at for h. the entire procedure was performed at . the proteins contained in the enriched _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ were solubilized in a methanol bicarbonate buffer and digested with trypsin as previously described.citation after complete digestion in the methanol bicarbonate buffer chloroform extraction was performed . prior to extraction the methanol concentration was lowered to using a stream of nitrogen which did not promote any peptide precipitation . once the sample contained methanol chloroform was added to the digested sample using a volume equivalent of . the sample was then vortexed for at least s and the phases were separated by centrifuging at rpm for min . the upper aqueous layer containing the peptides was removed lyophilized and stored at . following digestion and the evaporation of methanol to peptides were purified via spe using a prevail extract clean column connected to a vacuum manifold as previously described.citation briefly the column was equilibrated with ml of water and ml of mm ammonium bicarbonate ph followed by sample loading then washing with ml of mm ammonium bicarbonate ph . peptides were eluted with ml of of formic acid lyophilized and then stored at . scxc was performed as previously describedcitation using a mm mm polysulfoethyl aspartamide scx column connected to an agilent analytical hplc system equipped with a diode array detector . peptides collected during scxc were analyzed by microcapillary reversed phase _METHOD_ using an agilent series high performance capillary lc system coupled with a lcq deca ion trap _METHOD_ spectrometer containing an in house slurry packed cm o.d . i.d . capillary containing jupiter stationary phase connected to a custom esi interface as previously described.citation the mobile phases consisted of formic acid in water and formic acid in acetonitrile . the peptides in each fraction were solubilized in of b and injections were analyzed using two different reversed phase gradients . for the first gradient program the sample was loaded onto the reversed phase column and the gradient program held the flow rate of at b for min and then initiated a linear gradient to b over min . for the second gradient after sample loading the gradient program held the flow rate of at b for min and then initiated a linear gradient to b over min a linear gradient to b over min and then a linear gradient to b over min . after each separation the column was washed with b for min and then equilibrated with b for min prior to the next injection . the lcq deca was operated in the data dependent acquisition _METHOD_ mode in which the four most intense ions detected in the precursor _METHOD_ scan were selected for collision induced dissociation . a min dynamic m/z exclusion list for selected precursor ions was utilized to increase the detection of lower abundant peptides during gradient elution . data were acquired in the centroid mode for the m/z range using a normalized collision energy setting during cid of . peptides were identified by searching the product ion spectra against the a. thaliana database obtained from the arabidopsis information resource web site using turbosequest . an indexed _PROTEIN_ arabidopsis database was also constructed using the reversed amino acid sequence for each protein . both databases were then indexed by turbosequest using our searching criteria and used for interrogating all product ion spectra . peptide identifications were extracted from the output files using in house developed software . all searches included a static _PROTEIN_ modification of u on cys residues due to alkylation and a variable phosphorylation modification of u on ser thr and tyr residues . for dta file generation and precursor ion tolerance a value of u was used for all searches . the peptides listed in all tables are unique sequences however these peptides may not be unique to a single protein and thus may also exactly match several other protein _METHOD_ which are not considered in the post acquisition analysis unless otherwise noted . the product ion spectra acquired with each method was searched using the same forward and _PROTEIN_ arabidopsis database and search parameters . however since each data set was produced from two different extraction methods and each contained a dda based _METHOD_ analysis of fractions using two different reversed phase gradients a false discovery rate _PROTEIN_ was determined using a more comprehensive approach in order to generate data sets that allow for a more direct qualitative comparison . for our analysis a _PROTEIN_ was obtained based on statistical analysis of each precursor charge state and used to determine the threshold values for cross correlation score and delta correlation score for each data set . the initial data set for each sample had a of at least and an xcorr of and for and charged precursor ions respectively . changes in the _PROTEIN_ based on only the were calculated using increments of units to determine an upper limit to yield the lowest _PROTEIN_ across all charge states while maximizing the number of peptides identified in the forward database . the optimum value for each data set was determined to be . next the xcorr thresholds were determined at a _PROTEIN_ for each charge state using the value of or greater . data were plotted and statistical analysis was performed using easyfit . probability density distributions of xcorrs of each charge state were tested for normality using and goodness of fit analysis . although each of the xcorr distributions for product ions generated from each charge state followed several probability distributions with similar goodness of fit a general pareto distribution was chosen as the best fitting distribution since it was the highest scoring distribution for each charge state . an xcorr score probability distribution was generated for the forward and reverse database search results for each charge state . the xcorr threshold was determined for a _PROTEIN_ using eq citation where _PROTEIN_ is the false discovery rate n is the number of xcorrs in a probability distribution is the upper bound of the probability distribution x is the xcorr threshold p is the probability distribution function for all xcorrs in a data set r denotes the reverse _PROTEIN_ database and f denotes the forward database . the list of _PROTEIN_ numbers for the proteins identified by the chloroform and spe methods were submitted to the arabidopsis subcellular proteomic database _PROTEIN_ to obtain protein localization as determined by wolf psort _METHOD_ and the grand average of hydropathicity _PROTEIN_ values . peptide _PROTEIN_ values were determined by the protparam sequence analysis tool . putative tmds were determined by _PROTEIN_ arabidopsis integral _LOCATION_ protein database .
