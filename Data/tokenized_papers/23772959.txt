to test whether homodimers of fragments of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ similar to those of _PROTEIN_ can launch r signaling we constructed chimeric genes consisting of the domains of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ fused to the _METHOD_ reporter under the control of the viral promoter . these domains were selected on homology to the region of _PROTEIN_ . appropriate dimerization and targeted constitutive subcellular localization were achieved by the addition of the domain of the cprf transcription _PROTEIN_ and the sv nls peptide or _LOCATION_ exclusion signal as described by et al . and wolf et al . . the domain structures of the various fusion proteins are shown in fig . . the synergistic and in some cases antagonistic action of phytochrome species makes the elucidation of the roles of minor family members in single mutants difficult . therefore we used or combinations showing characteristic deficient phenotypes to assess the functions of these fusion proteins . we regenerated independent transgenic lines for each construct and used quantitative western blot hybridization to select lines which _PROTEIN_ the individual _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ and their derivative fusion proteins approximately at the same or at least comparable levels . the genetic backgrounds of the transgenic lines and the _PROTEIN_ levels of the various fusion proteins relative to their endogenous _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ counterparts are shown in tables and respectively . the selected transgenic _PROTEIN_ mutant lines the _METHOD_ c. whereas the _PROTEIN_ level of the _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ fusion proteins was c. or of the endogenous _PROTEIN_ respectively . _METHOD_ fully and the _METHOD_ fusion protein partially restored r hypocotyl growth inhibition of the _PROTEIN_ mutant . r expansion of the cotyledon area of the mutant was also restored and in this case _METHOD_ seedlings exhibited a weak phenotype whereas the _METHOD_ seedlings displayed a nearly fully complemented phenotype . these fusion proteins also restored _PROTEIN_ function in regulating the flowering time under sd conditions . by contrast the _METHOD_ photoreceptor was biologically inactive in all responses tested as the _METHOD_ seedlings invariably displayed the original _PROTEIN_ mutant phenotype in all experiments performed . the abundance of the native _PROTEIN_ and the various _METHOD_ fusion proteins was by constant r light irradiation . irradiation with h of cr light reduced the level of the endogenous _PROTEIN_ below the detection level and _PROTEIN_ the levels of all other _PROTEIN_ fusion proteins c. . microscopic analysis of the nucleo/cytoplasmic distribution of the various _METHOD_ fusion proteins demonstrated that in etiolated as well as r seedlings _METHOD_ was detectable only in the _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ was localized exclusively in the cytoplasm and _METHOD_ was observed in both the _LOCATION_ and cytoplasm in etiolated as well in r seedlings . a r light treatment induced the formation of early _METHOD_ nbs whereas a prolonged r light treatment promoted the formation of _PROTEIN_ stable _METHOD_ nbs . under these conditions we could not detect the appearance of either early or _PROTEIN_ nbs associated with the truncated _METHOD_ of _PROTEIN_ . quantitative analysis of r accumulation of the fusion protein indicated that a cr light treatment did not modify significantly the level of _METHOD_ in the _LOCATION_ . the selected transgenic _PROTEIN_ plants _METHOD_ and the _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ fusion proteins c. and respectively when compared with endogenous _PROTEIN_ . analysis of r hypocotyl growth inhibition cotyledon expansion and flowering time under sd conditions demonstrated that the _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ fusion proteins were biologically active . as for hypocotyl growth inhibition and cotyledon expansion _METHOD_ displayed a dramatic and _METHOD_ a moderate phenotype when compared with the _PROTEIN_ double null mutant . the flowering time of the _PROTEIN_ mutant was also fully restored by _METHOD_ whereas the _METHOD_ lines again displayed strong phenotypes . the _METHOD_ fusion protein was biologically inactive as transgenic seedlings/plants invariably displayed the original _PROTEIN_ mutant phenotype for all responses tested . the abundance of the native _PROTEIN_ and the various _METHOD_ fusion proteins was not affected significantly by cr light treatment . irradiation with cr light did not modify the level of either the native _PROTEIN_ or the and truncated _METHOD_ fusion proteins . the nucleo/cytoplasmic distribution of the various _METHOD_ fusion proteins was analyzed as described for the various _METHOD_ fusion proteins . _METHOD_ was visible in the _LOCATION_ under all conditions tested whereas _METHOD_ was detected exclusively in the cytoplasm and these truncated proteins never associated with nbs . _METHOD_ was clearly visible in the _LOCATION_ in etiolated seedlings and r light treatments did not affect the amount of photoreceptor localized in the _LOCATION_ or induce the formation of early/late _METHOD_ nbs . quantitative analysis of the accumulation of _METHOD_ in the _LOCATION_ corroborated these observations . the selected transgenic _PROTEIN_ plants _PROTEIN_ the _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ fusion proteins to and the _METHOD_ protein c. to more strongly than the native _PROTEIN_ analysis of r inhibition of hypocotyl growth and cotyledon expansion demonstrated that with the exception of _METHOD_ these fusion proteins efficiently complemented the _PROTEIN_ mutant and even displayed characteristic phenotypes when compared with _PROTEIN_ mutants . these responses were induced at very low fluence rates and saturated at low fluence rates . transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ localized homodimers of fragments of _PROTEIN_ but not the _PROTEIN_ were similarly hypersensitive at low fluences of r light . the same fusion proteins again with the exception of the truncated _METHOD_ complemented the flowering time of the _PROTEIN_ triple mutant . the abundance of the native _PROTEIN_ and the various _METHOD_ fusion proteins was by irradiation with cr light . exposure to h cr light reduced the abundance level of the native _PROTEIN_ c. and that of the and truncated _METHOD_ fusion proteins c. .we also analyzed the cellular distribution of the and truncated _METHOD_ fusion proteins in this genetic background . the _METHOD_ fusion protein was constitutively _LOCATION_ its accumulation in the _LOCATION_ did not increase after prolonged exposure to r light . by contrast _METHOD_ as expected was detectable only in the cytoplasm independent of the light conditions . as for _METHOD_ short r light irradiation induced the formation of early nbs but extended r treatment did not promote the appearance of _PROTEIN_ stable nbs associated with this fusion protein . by contrast we could not detect the formation of any nbs containing _METHOD_ . the _METHOD_ fusion protein was detectable in the _LOCATION_ of etiolated seedlings but a r light treatment clearly induced its _LOCATION_ abundance . in addition r light also induced the appearance of early nbs but did not promote the formation of _PROTEIN_ stable _METHOD_ nbs . quantitative analysis of the r accumulation of the _METHOD_ fusion protein in the _LOCATION_ corroborated these observations . to test to what extent the functionality of _METHOD_ depends on _PROTEIN_ the _METHOD_ transgene from the _PROTEIN_ mutant was introgressed into the _PROTEIN_ quadruple null background . analysis of r hypocotyl growth inhibition demonstrated that _METHOD_ is functional in the absence of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . this figure also shows that seedlings _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ display a characteristic phenotype when compared with the _PROTEIN_ mutant and the physiological response in this genetic background also saturates at fluence rate of r light and resembles the data obtained by the analysis of _METHOD_ function in the _PROTEIN_ triple null background . the extreme sensitivity of these _METHOD_ responses to r light prompted us to test whether the biological activity and _LOCATION_ accumulation of _PROTEIN_ are mediated by _PROTEIN_ proteins shown to be essential for the translocation of _PROTEIN_ into the _LOCATION_ . to this end we produced _METHOD_ transgenic _PROTEIN_ mutant lines . figure illustrates that the _METHOD_ seedlings are hypersensitive to low fluences of r light when compared with _PROTEIN_ or wt . quantitative analysis of r accumulation of _METHOD_ in the _LOCATION_ demonstrated that this process is saturated at fluence rate of r light in contrast with _METHOD_ . we note that r light is ineffective in inducing the formation of early and/or _PROTEIN_ stable _METHOD_ nbs in the _PROTEIN_ background whereas these _LOCATION_ structures were readily detectable in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . to test whether the _METHOD_ photoreceptor functions and is imported into the _LOCATION_ as a monomer or homodimer we analyzed total protein extracts prepared from etiolated and r seedlings by native gel electrophoresis . our data demonstrate that the _METHOD_ fusion protein is detected nearly exclusively as a homodimer in these extracts and that extended irradiation with r light reduces significantly the abundance of _METHOD_ . in addition we show that similar to the _PROTEIN_ null mutant a short pulse of r light is not capable of inducing significant accumulation of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ transcripts in transgenic _PROTEIN_ seedlings _METHOD_ . however fig . indicates that _METHOD_ in the _PROTEIN_ and/or _PROTEIN_ background can restore the transcriptional regulation of and thought to regulate cell wall extension in an opposite fashion . taken together these data strongly suggest that _METHOD_ can function as a homodimer independent of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ the _LOCATION_ import of _PROTEIN_ does not require functional _PROTEIN_ proteins the _PROTEIN_ signaling cascade operates differently from that controlled by _PROTEIN_ at very low fluences of r light and the formation of _PROTEIN_ stable _METHOD_ nbs requires functional _PROTEIN_ .
