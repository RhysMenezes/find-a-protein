in plant cells how integral _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ proteins are degraded in a cargo manner remains elusive . here we studied the degradative pathway of two plant pm proteins a type i integral _LOCATION_ protein belonging to the repeat kinase protein family and _LOCATION_ a tetraspan transmembrane protein located on the pm and network or early endosome . using wortmannin and _PROTEIN_ mutant that could enlarge the multivesicular body or prevacuolar compartment as tools we demonstrated that when _PROTEIN_ as green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ fusions in tobacco or arabidopsis protoplasts both and were degraded in the lytic _LOCATION_ via the internal vesicles of mvb/pvc in a cargo manner . such _LOCATION_ degradation of pm proteins was further supported by immunocytochemical electron microscopy study showing the labeling of the fusions on the internal vesicles of the pvc/mvb . thus cargo and degradation of pm proteins in the _LOCATION_ is functionally operated in plant cells .
we first cloned a type i integral _LOCATION_ protein which encodes a of and generated the _METHOD_ fusion . when transiently _PROTEIN_ in tobacco protoplast _METHOD_ was found on the pm and small punctate structures . to find out whether reaches the pm via a classical _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ pathway as other pm proteins we next tested the effects of two vesicle trafficking inhibitors _PROTEIN_ and concanamycin a . _PROTEIN_ can disrupt the transport between the _LOCATION_ and the _LOCATION_ while conca can trap the newly synthesized pm proteins in the tgn citation citation citation citation citation . in protoplasts _METHOD_ and the pm/tgn marker _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ trapped both proteins in _LOCATION_ whereas conca treatment retained these two proteins within aggregates . these results indicate that likely follows a similar biosynthetic _LOCATION_ pathway as that of citation . however we can not exclude the possibility that may reach the pm first and then undergo endocytosis from the pm to reach the tgn for recycling or degradation . in addition to pm localization _METHOD_ also reached some _LOCATION_ organelles as punctate green dots were detected inside the cells . to find out the nature of these _METHOD_ positive organelles _METHOD_ was transiently with either the tgn marker _METHOD_ citation citation citation or the pvc marker _METHOD_ citation citation followed by confocal imaging at different time points after transformation . eight or h after transient _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was found to partially colocalize with both markers respectively indicating that _METHOD_ reached both the tgn and pvc . interestingly h after transient _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ weak _METHOD_ signal was detected in the _LOCATION_ and thi signal increased substantially at h after _PROTEIN_ . the _METHOD_ signal was presented in the lumen rather than in the tonoplast indicating that _METHOD_ is internalized and subjected to degradation inside the _LOCATION_ . however since the _METHOD_ faces to the _LOCATION_ side of the _LOCATION_ it is not known how the _METHOD_ signal is internalized into the lumen of the _LOCATION_ . to find out the possible _METHOD_ two _LOCATION_ markers were used in the following study . _METHOD_ is a soluble _LOCATION_ cargo reporter that trafficks to the lumen of the lv citation whereas _METHOD_ is a tonoplast marker with multiple transmembrane domains citation citation . when with the pvc marker _METHOD_ in tobacco protoplasts similar to _METHOD_ both _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ reached the _LOCATION_ via the same _METHOD_ pvc . however when the cells were treated with wortmannin a drug that enlarges the pvc in planta citation citation citation citation these two markers showed different localizations on the enlarged pvc while _METHOD_ concentrated in the lumen to form a structure within the enlarged pvc _METHOD_ stayed on the outer _LOCATION_ of the enlarged pvc . when similar experiments were performed with _METHOD_ the _METHOD_ signal was found primarily in the lumen of the enlarged pvc a result similar to that of the soluble cargo _METHOD_ but distinct from the _LOCATION_ protein _METHOD_ . these results indicate that _METHOD_ must have internalized into the lumen of the pvc before reaching the _LOCATION_ however whether further processing of _METHOD_ initiates at this compartment or lv remains unclear . thus the pvc may act as an intermediate compartment mediating the degradation of _METHOD_ in the _LOCATION_ . to find out whether the internalization and degradation of _METHOD_ in the _LOCATION_ depends on its ubiquitination we removed all the potential ubiquitination _LOCATION_ lysine residues by truncating the whole of and generated the _METHOD_ fusion . when _PROTEIN_ in protoplasts the _METHOD_ fusion showed a similar pm pattern as the full length _METHOD_ . in addition in cells _METHOD_ and the pvc marker _METHOD_ similar to _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was also found to reach the pvc at earlier stages and the lv at _PROTEIN_ stage . these results indicate that the of is not important for either the biosynthetic or degradative pathways of this protein . we next performed a similar experiment for a tetraspan pm protein . upon transient _PROTEIN_ in tobacco protoplasts _METHOD_ colocalized with the tgn marker _METHOD_ but separated from the pvc marker _METHOD_ at h after transformation . however at a _PROTEIN_ stage _METHOD_ gradually reached the pvc and lv respectively . therefore _METHOD_ follows the same degradative pathway as that of _METHOD_ even though _METHOD_ reaches the pvc and _LOCATION_ more slowly . to find out whether the _LOCATION_ internalization and degradation of is dependent on its ubiquitination we first studied the fate of an mutant missing its potential sites for ubiquitination at the . _METHOD_ an mutant lacking most of its remained on the pm citation . when _PROTEIN_ in protoplast _METHOD_ was found to follow the identical degradative pathway as that of the full length because it reached the _LOCATION_ via the pvc . to exclude the potential ubiquitination of the two lysine residues at the of _METHOD_ these two lysine residues were mutated and the _METHOD_ fusion was generated . similarly when _PROTEIN_ in protoplast the _METHOD_ fusion reached the _LOCATION_ via the same pvc . when the remaining lysine residues are analyzed a lysine residue is predicted to locate within the third tmd but is found to be very close to the _LOCATION_ flanking region . to exclude the possibility that this lysine residue may locate in the _LOCATION_ and cause ubiquitination of the fusion protein we also mutated it into alanine for analysis . as shown in figure c _METHOD_ was found to reach the _LOCATION_ in an identical way as that of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ . _METHOD_ fusions have been widely used to study the _LOCATION_ degradation _METHOD_ of model marker proteins in various _METHOD_ including egfr in mammals citation _PROTEIN_ in yeast citation and _PROTEIN_ in plants citation . in these studies _METHOD_ was fused to the _LOCATION_ side of the _LOCATION_ proteins but _METHOD_ alone did not induce either _LOCATION_ degradation or ubiquitination of these fusion proteins . to rule out the possibility that internalization of the pm proteins is induced by the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ tag in our experiments we next analyzed the topology of the _LOCATION_ proteins using a previously established method citation . as shown in figure the _METHOD_ tag was shown to be present at the _LOCATION_ side of the _LOCATION_ in _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ fusion proteins . as both _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ but not _METHOD_ were detected in the lumen of the pvc and _LOCATION_ we therefore conclude that the _METHOD_ tag alone does not induce _LOCATION_ degradation of the fusion proteins in our study which is consistent with previous studies on _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ citation citation . the possible effect of _METHOD_ fusion to the of either or was also tested . as shown in figure similar to _METHOD_ _METHOD_ gradually reached the pvc and _LOCATION_ at and h after transient _PROTEIN_ indicating that the position of _METHOD_ fusion to did not change their fate . however _METHOD_ fusions to prevented them from leaving the _LOCATION_ upon transient _PROTEIN_ in protoplasts indicating that such fusion is not proper for reflecting the untagged protein . indeed studies on pm receptors including _PROTEIN_ citation _PROTEIN_ receptor kinase citation _PROTEIN_ citation too _PROTEIN_ mouths citation and _PROTEIN_ citation have been carried out using _METHOD_ fusions at their _LOCATION_ . to further confirm the results obtained from the above experiments using tobacco protoplasts we next generated transgenic tobacco cells overexpressing _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ citation . as shown in figure b both _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ are localized to the pm and some punctate _LOCATION_ organelles . however the _METHOD_ signal in the _LOCATION_ was also observed in cells _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ but not _METHOD_ . to characterize these _METHOD_ organelles transgenic cells were subjected to freezing/frozen substitution followed by ultrathin sectioning and immunogold em studies with _METHOD_ antibodies . as shown in figure h both _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ were found to localize to the pm tgn and internal vesicles of mvb/pvc . when statistical analysis was carried out the relative abundance of _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ on tgn or mvb/pvc was different while _METHOD_ was _PROTEIN_ located in the tgn and early endosomes that may be involved in the recycling of pm proteins citation citation citation citation citation citation _METHOD_ showed a much higher percentage of labeling on the internal vesicles of mvb . to further find out if the above results obtained in cells are also valid in arabidopsis cells we performed identical experiments using arabidopsis protoplasts . as shown in figure all the previously tested four _METHOD_ fusions _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ showed similar pvc to _LOCATION_ patterns a result identical to those observed in protoplasts . to further study the fate of these pm proteins on the mvb/pvc we _METHOD_ a _PROTEIN_ binding form of the small _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ causing the enlargement of plant pvc/mvb citation citation . as shown in figure all four _METHOD_ fusions _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ were found in the lumen of the enlarged pvc caused by _METHOD_ which is similar to that of the soluble cargo reporter _METHOD_ whereas _METHOD_ remained on the limiting _LOCATION_ . to further verify the above confocal data we next carried out western blot analysis to follow the fate of these fusions upon transient _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis protoplasts . as shown in figure in cells _PROTEIN_ either the full length or lysine truncated/mutated fusions of and a kda protein band which represents the classical _LOCATION_ degradative products of the _METHOD_ fusions citation citation citation was detected in the cs fraction by _METHOD_ antibodies . in addition in cells _PROTEIN_ or its ct truncation the relative amount of their fusions were estimated to be similar accounting for about of the total protein detected by _METHOD_ . similarly in cells _PROTEIN_ or its truncated/mutated fusions the relative amount of their fusions were also estimated to be similar but accounting for about of the total protein detected by _METHOD_ . to further find out whether and are ubiquitinated upon their _PROTEIN_ in plant cells we also performed pull down analysis following a similar strategy described previously citation citation using the _METHOD_ fusion as the positive control for ubiquitination citation . thus total proteins isolated from protoplasts _PROTEIN_ various constructs were first subjected to pull down experiments with _METHOD_ followed by protein separation via _PROTEIN_ and subsequent western blot detection using either _METHOD_ or ubiquitin antibodies . as shown in figure all _PROTEIN_ fusions were successfully and detected by _METHOD_ antibodies . however while the positive control _METHOD_ fusion was recognized as protein smears by ubq antibodies citation no signal was detected in cells _PROTEIN_ the two pm proteins _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ . taken together all these results demonstrate the existence of a conserved and cargo _LOCATION_ degradative pathway for pm proteins in both tobacco and arabidopsis cells .
