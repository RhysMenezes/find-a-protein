plants sense phosphate deficiency and initiate signaling that controls _PROTEIN_ responses necessary for pi acquisition . herein evidence establishes that _PROTEIN_ is a plant small ubiquitin like modifier ligase and is a focal controller of pi starvation dependent responses . t dna insertional mutated alleles of _PROTEIN_ cause arabidopsis to exhibit exaggerated prototypical pi starvation responses including cessation of primary root growth extensive _PROTEIN_ root and root hair development increase in root/shoot _METHOD_ ratio and greater anthocyanin accumulation even though intracellular pi levels in _PROTEIN_ plants were similar to wild type . _PROTEIN_ has sumo ligase activity in vitro and immunoblot analysis revealed that the protein sumoylation profile is impaired in _PROTEIN_ plants . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was localized to _LOCATION_ foci . steadystate transcript abundances of pi starvation responsive genes _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were moderate but clearly greater in _PROTEIN_ seedlings than in wild type where pi is sufficient . pi starvation induced the _PROTEIN_ of these genes to the same extent in _PROTEIN_ and wild type seedlings . however two other pi starvation responsive genes _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are induced more slowly in _PROTEIN_ seedlings by pi limitation . _PROTEIN_ a myb transcriptional activator of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ is an _PROTEIN_ sumoylation target . these results indicate that _PROTEIN_ is a sumo ligase and that sumoylation is a control mechanism that acts both negatively and positively on different pi deficiency responses .
t dna insertional mutations in _PROTEIN_ suppress the salt sensitive phenotype of _PROTEIN_ and cause hyperresponsiveness to pi limitation . lines from a t dna insertion population in the arabidopsis col _PROTEIN_ background were screened to identify second site mutations that enhance nacl tolerance . the _PROTEIN_ mutation suppressed nacl sensitivity of _PROTEIN_ seedlings but to a lesser extent than did _PROTEIN_ alleles . _PROTEIN_ the macronutrient concentration in the _METHOD_ salt formulation to resulted in a substantial reduction in primary root growth of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ seedlings . normal root growth was restored by inclusion in the medium of mm either as or but not by inclusion of any other macronutrient at the concentration in the full strength _METHOD_ salt formulation e.g. mm kcl mm _PROTEIN_ mm or mm . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ seedlings exhibited substantially more pronounced prototypical pi starvation root architecture responses than _PROTEIN_ or wild type seedlings . on pi limited medium _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ seedlings exhibited an inhibition of primary root growth an increase in _PROTEIN_ root development and length an increase in root hair number and length and higher root/shoot fresh weight ratio than wild type . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plants grown on pi deficient medium for days also accumulated more anthocyanin in leaves than did the wild type and many of the _PROTEIN_ leaves were necrotic . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plants grown in the greenhouse or growth chamber always exhibited reduced shoot and root _METHOD_ relative to the wild type that was not evident when these plants were grown in vitro . despite this phenomenon the relative increase in root/shoot _METHOD_ was greater for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plants than the wild type after transfer to pi deficient medium in hydroponic solution . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plants grown hydroponically began anthocyanin accumulation sooner than the wild type after transfer to pi deficient medium . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ seedlings and plants grown in pi sufficient medium and hydroponic solution respectively accumulated more intracellular pi in shoots than did the wild type or _PROTEIN_ but piint in roots of these plants was similar . _METHOD_ of pi toxicity were not detected in shoots of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ seedlings as is the case in shoots of pi hyperaccumulating _PROTEIN_ that was included as a control in this experiment . piint levels in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and wild type seedlings and plants were similar when grown in pi deficient medium or solution even though _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ seedlings exhibited responses to pi limitation earlier and to a greater extent than the wild type . _PROTEIN_ encodes a putative sumo ligase . thermal asymmetric interlaced pcr analysis of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plants identified a t dna insertion in the exon of _GENE_ at bp from the translation initiation codon as determined by analysis of the full length cdna sequence . _GENE_ is annotated as _PROTEIN_ and this mutant allele is designated as _PROTEIN_ . using the genbank database the _PROTEIN_ product is predicted to be a peptide of aa which is an apparent ortholog of saccharomyces cervisiae _PROTEIN_ and and human protein inhibitor of activated signal transducer and activator of transcription _PROTEIN_ proteins . _PROTEIN_ contains five predicted domains conserved in siz/pias sumo ligases . these domains include a _PROTEIN_ domain that is implicated in chromatin organization a siz/pias _PROTEIN_ domain that is necessary for sumo ligase activity a _PROTEIN_ motif for _LOCATION_ retention a sxs motif that promotes binding to sumo and a putative _LOCATION_ localization sequence . _PROTEIN_ also has a plant homeodomain finger domain that is not present in siz/pias proteins . the phd domain is associated with chromatin remodeling complexes or functions as an ubiquitin ligase . and analyses of progeny derived from a backcross with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ indicated that _PROTEIN_ is a monogenic recessive mutation . seedlings harboring additional mutations in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ exhibited similar root architecture responses to pi deficiency as did _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ seedlings and these responses were suppressed by the addition of either or . furthermore _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ seedlings and plants accumulated comparable piint and developed a higher root/shoot _METHOD_ ratio in response to pi deprivation as did _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . these data establish that the responses to pi limitation exhibited by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ seedlings are due to the _PROTEIN_ mutation . primary root growth analysis on pi deficient medium of progeny from the cross between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ indicated that the mutations are allelic . _PROTEIN_ mrna was more abundant in roots than in shoots of wild type and _PROTEIN_ seedlings but was not detected in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ seedlings or _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ seedlings . in vitro and in vivo data indicate that _PROTEIN_ functions as a sumo ligase . an immunoblot of total protein by using anti _PROTEIN_ indicated no difference in accumulation of sumo or sumo conjugation products in _PROTEIN_ and wild type seedlings that are grown at . in contrast _PROTEIN_ seedlings accumulate numerous sumoylated products whereas the amounts of free sumo peptides are depleted . heat shock increased sumo conjugation in wild type plants but the extent of heat shock induced sumoylation was substantially less in _PROTEIN_ plants . together these results provide evidence that _PROTEIN_ is involved in the sumoylation of arabidopsis proteins . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ could substitute for his to stimulate sumoylation in an in vitro assay that included s. cerevisiae _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ sumo substrate and sumo and used anti to detect sumoylated products . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or was detected on the anti immunoblot because each protein is sumoylated . immunoblot analysis by using anti antibody indicated that _PROTEIN_ mediates cojugation to as does . contains seven sumoylation sites and these different products are evident on the blot . together the immunoblot analysis of the in vivo sumoylation products and the in vitro assay results establish that _PROTEIN_ functions as a sumo ligase in arabidopsis . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was detected specifically in the same compartment as the red _METHOD_ protein control indicating that _PROTEIN_ is localized to the _LOCATION_ . higher magnification revealed that _PROTEIN_ localizes predominantly to punctuate structures in the _LOCATION_ . _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ suppressed both the hyperresponses of _PROTEIN_ seedlings to pi starvation and the reduced shoot and root _METHOD_ phenotypes of _PROTEIN_ plants . these results indicate that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ is functional and that _PROTEIN_ compartmentalizes to _LOCATION_ speckles as do _PROTEIN_ proteins . _PROTEIN_ mutations cause an alteration in pi starvation dependent signaling . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ but not _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ transcript abundances were greater in _PROTEIN_ than in wild type seedlings when both were grown in pi sufficient medium . however pi starvation induced the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ to a comparable level in both the wild type and _PROTEIN_ seedlings after h in pi deficient medium . pi starvation induction of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ transcript abundances occurred more slowly in _PROTEIN_ than in wild type seedlings but eventually increased to levels similar to the wild type after an extended period of pi limitation . together these results indicate that the function of _PROTEIN_ in pi starvation signaling is different for these two specific subsets of target genes . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are negatively regulated by _PROTEIN_ in pi sufficient conditions and _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are positively regulated by _PROTEIN_ during the initial stages of induction by pi limitation . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are members of the _PROTEIN_ regulon . the myb transcription _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ which binds to a element in the promoter of _PROTEIN_ and is necessary for transcription of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ contains two predicted sumoylation sites . _PROTEIN_ facilitated the sumoylation of _PROTEIN_ . mutations to residues in the predicted sumoylation sites and in _PROTEIN_ prevented sumoylation of _PROTEIN_ . these results further indicate that sumoylation of _PROTEIN_ positively controls the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ .
