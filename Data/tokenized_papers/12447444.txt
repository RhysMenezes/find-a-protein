boron deficiency hampers the productivity of crops in more than countries . boron is essential in higher plants primarily for _PROTEIN_ the integrity of cell walls and is also beneficial and might be essential in animals and in yeast . understanding the molecular mechanism of boron transport is crucial for alleviating boron deficiency . here we describe the molecular identification of boron transporters in biological _METHOD_ . the arabidopsis thaliana mutant _PROTEIN_ is sensitive to boron deficiency . uptake studies indicated that xylem loading is the key step for boron accumulation in shoots with a low external boron supply and that the _PROTEIN_ mutant is defective in this process . positional cloning identified _PROTEIN_ as a _LOCATION_ protein with homology to bicarbonate transporters in animals . moreover a fusion protein of _PROTEIN_ and green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ localized to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ in transformed cells . the promoter of _PROTEIN_ drove _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in root pericycle cells . when _PROTEIN_ in yeast _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ boron concentrations in cells . we show here that _PROTEIN_ is an efflux type boron transporter for xylem loading and is essential for protecting shoots from boron deficiency .
the mechanism of boron _LOCATION_ transport in plants has long been controversial the most widely accepted theory was that of a passive transport of boric acid whereas recent physiological studies indicated the involvement of active transport . the arabidopsis thaliana mutant _PROTEIN_ requires high levels of boron for normal growth . growth impairment of _PROTEIN_ mutant plants under low boron supply is more evident in leaves than in roots and the mutation carried by _PROTEIN_ mutant plants is suggested to affect the root to shoot transport of boron in plants rather than the structural function of boron in cell walls . here we describe the identification of _PROTEIN_ as a boron transporter essential for alleviating boron deficiency . the concentration of boron in rosette leaves of wild type and _PROTEIN_ mutant plants increased with the concentration of boric acid in the nutrient solution . boron concentrations in the rosette leaves of wild type col plants were always higher than those in the _PROTEIN_ plants under the nutrient conditions tested indicating that _PROTEIN_ plants have a reduced capacity to accumulate boron in leaves over a wide range of external boron concentrations . the pathway of nutrient transport from the root surface to the shoot includes at least two transmembrane transport events import into epidermal or cortex cells and export from pericycle or xylem parenchyma cells into the stelar apoplasm . as has been shown for phosphate and potassium xylem loading is a key step for nutrient accumulation in the shoots . the transport events of boron in arabidopsis plants were studied with enriched boron as a tracer . we examined concentrations of tracer boron in root cell saps representing the water soluble fraction in roots and in xylem exudates after tracer boron had been supplied for h. the concentration of tracer boron in root cell saps increased in proportion to tracer boron concentration in the medium in both genotypes suggesting that uptake into roots occurs _PROTEIN_ by passive transport . the concentration of tracer boron in xylem exudates of the _PROTEIN_ plants also followed a linear concentration dependence whereas in the wild type plants a combination of saturable and linear concentration dependence was observed . when the tracer boron supply was or lower tracer boron concentrations in xylem exudates of wild type plants were significantly higher than those in the medium the root cell sap of the wild type plants and the xylem exudate of _PROTEIN_ plants . these results indicate that xylem loading is the key step for boron accumulation in shoots at low external boron supply and that _PROTEIN_ is an essential component in this process . the _PROTEIN_ locus is located on the lower arm of chromosome . analysis of plants delimited _PROTEIN_ to a kilobase region between newly generated molecular markers at positions kb and kb . nucleotide sequences of this region in the genome of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants revealed that each mutant contains a different single base substitution in the hypothetical open reading frame _GENE_ each causing a different amino acid substitution in the predicted protein . a genomic dna fragment containing wild type _GENE_ was then introduced into the _PROTEIN_ mutant and several independent transgenic plants were generated . growth of the transgenic _PROTEIN_ plants was indistinguishable from that of the col wild type on low boron medium . in contrast growth of the non transgenic _PROTEIN_ plants was inhibited on the same medium establishing that _GENE_ corresponds to the _PROTEIN_ gene . the _PROTEIN_ orf was determined by sequencing a corresponding cdna obtained from kazusa dna research institute . comparison between the cdna and genomic sequences revealed that _PROTEIN_ has exons . on the basis of the nucleotide sequence _PROTEIN_ was predicted to encode a polypeptide of amino acids containing putative transmembrane domains . the mutations found in the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ alleles were located within the second transmembrane domain . database searches revealed that there are six similar predicted proteins to _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis _GENE_ _GENE_ _GENE_ and . the amino acid sequences of the predicted proteins were identical to _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ also exhibited strong similarity to _PROTEIN_ sequence tag clones from diverse plant species including both _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ indicating that _PROTEIN_ belongs to a group of highly conserved _LOCATION_ proteins in plants . _PROTEIN_ is also similar to bicarbonate transporters of animal origins including cl exchangers na co transporters and na driven cl exchangers . _PROTEIN_ and bicarbonate transporters of animals also show significant similarity to a _LOCATION_ protein of yeast . the amino acid sequence of was identical to _PROTEIN_ in a amino acid overlap by fasta analysis . subcellular fractionation and _METHOD_ labelling experiments indicated that was localized to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and a binding assay suggested that i br and cl were the potential substrates . both mutations in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ alleles alter amino acid residues that are highly conserved among the similar proteins in plants yeast and animals . to investigate the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ a translational fusion between _PROTEIN_ and green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ was delivered into tobacco leaf cells by particle bombardment . cells _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion showed a _METHOD_ signal only at the periphery of the cell whereas in cells _PROTEIN_ free _METHOD_ the signal was also observed in a region around the _LOCATION_ and in the _LOCATION_ as evidenced by cytoplasmic strands . together with the presence of transmembrane domains these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ is a _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ localized protein . cell type specificity of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was investigated with the generation of transgenic arabidopsis plants carrying the orf for _METHOD_ under the control of the _PROTEIN_ promoter region . the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ signal was observed in roots and was localized in the pericycle located at the outmost layer of the stele and the inside of the endodermis . pericycle specific _PROTEIN_ was observed in five independent transgenic lines analysed . the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ signal could not be clearly observed in shoots although the transcripts of _PROTEIN_ were detected from both shoots and roots of wild type plants by polymerase chain reaction with reverse transcription . the arabidopsis stelar k outward rectifying channel _PROTEIN_ is responsible for xylem loading of k and is also _PROTEIN_ in the root pericycle . pericycle specific _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ promoter supports the hypothesis that _PROTEIN_ is involved in the xylem loading of boron . we examined the boron transport activity of _PROTEIN_ in the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae by first comparing boron concentrations between a s. cerevisiae mutant carrying an insertion mutation in and the corresponding wild type strain . cells were first grown to mid exponential phase in liquid medium without boron supplementation and then incubated for min in the presence of boric acid followed by measurements of soluble and bound boron concentrations . surprisingly concentrations of soluble boron were about fold higher in the mutant than in the wild type whereas bound boron concentrations were similar between the two strains . we then _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ gene under control of the _PROTEIN_ promoter in the cells . the soluble boron concentrations in the cells _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ were about one third those in the cells carrying the empty vector whereas the bound boron concentrations were similar between these two yeast lines . at physiological ph boron exists _PROTEIN_ as undissociated boric acid . considering the relatively high permeability of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ for boric acid which allows the passive diffusion of boric acid into cells these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ and have boron efflux transport activity . although both _PROTEIN_ and are similar to bicarbonate transporters on a sequence basis the boron transport activity of _PROTEIN_ in contrast to was little affected by in the uptake solution . the present results establish that _PROTEIN_ is a boron transporter mediating boron export from pericycle cells into the root stelar apoplasm against a concentration gradient . consequently _PROTEIN_ increases the concentrations of boron in xylem sap and shoot organs thereby acting to protect the shoot from boron deficiency . to our knowledge _PROTEIN_ and represent the first identification of boron transporters in biological _METHOD_ and provide a molecular basis for active boron transport of boron in higher plants and yeast .
