we have identified and characterized two arabidopsis long coiled coil proteins _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ like _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are paralogs that consist predominantly of a long coiled coil domain _PROTEIN_ with a predicted transmembrane domain at the immediate c terminus . orthologs of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were found exclusively in vascular plants . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion proteins are anchored to the cytoplasmic surface of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ by a c terminal transmembrane domain and a short tail domain via a tail anchoring mechanism . t dna insertion mutants of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ as well as the double mutant show an increased sensitivity to the plant abiotic stress hormone abscisic acid in a post germination growth response . _PROTEIN_ but not _PROTEIN_ gene _PROTEIN_ is induced by the bacterial pathogen associated molecular pattern _PROTEIN_ . t dna insertion alleles of _PROTEIN_ but not _PROTEIN_ show increased susceptibility to the non virulent strain p. syringae pv . tomato hrcc but not to the virulent strain p. syringae pv . tomato . this suggests that _PROTEIN_ mutants are compromised in _PROTEIN_ triggered immunity _PROTEIN_ . the data presented here provide first evidence for the involvement of a plant long coiled coil protein in a plant defense response .
_PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were identified in a genome wide screen for arabidopsis long coiled coil proteins with one or more putative transmembrane domains . the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ database was used to identify and sort long coiled coil proteins in the predicted arabidopsis proteome . the filter parameters were set to identify genes encoding proteins that are at least amino acid long with at least coiled coil coverage and containing at least one predicted transmembrane domain . among the fourteen predicted proteins that were identified using the above criteria _PROTEIN_ encoded by has the highest coiled coil coverage . a close homolog _PROTEIN_ encoded by was also identified based on the above described criteria . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ share identity and similarity at the amino acid level . querying the protein basic local alignment search tool non redundant database orthologs of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were found exclusively in vascular plants and no orthologs were found in non vascular plants and non plant _METHOD_ . based on the phylogenetic relationships shown in it is not possible to determine whether the orthologs in other plant species are more closely related to _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ . putative protein structure of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ showing coiled coil and transmembrane domains . graphical representation of the maximum likehood phylogenetic tree of

program using default parameters . os oryza sativa pt populus trichocarpa rc ricinus communis sb sorghum bicolor vv vitis vinifera . the predicted tmd in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ is located amino acids from the c terminus . to investigate the subcellular location of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion proteins were transiently _PROTEIN_ under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus promoter in nicotiana benthamiana leaf epidermal cells and _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was observed by confocal laser scanning microscopy . the proteins were coexpressed with the _LOCATION_ marker hdel mcherry . _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ labeled a sharp reticulate network pattern and colocalized with the _LOCATION_ marker . when _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ were coexpressed with the tubulin and actin markers _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ respectively no colocalization was observed . to test if a c terminal fragment of amino acids which contains the transmembrane domain and the amino acid tail is sufficient for _LOCATION_ localization the _METHOD_ tagged partial proteins _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ _METHOD_ were generated . in addition _METHOD_ fused partial proteins without the tdf _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ were generated . the four proteins were transiently coexpressed with hdel mcherry in n. benthamiana . _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ _METHOD_ colocalized with the _LOCATION_ marker . in contrast _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ were not located at the _LOCATION_ but were found diffusely distributed in the cytoplasm closely resembling the localization pattern observed with free _METHOD_ . n terminally tagged _METHOD_ fusion proteins used in this study . amino acid sequence of the transmembrane domain and the c terminal tail are shown in blue and red letters respectively . numbers indicate amino acid positions . drawings are not to scale . confocal images showing localization of the fusion proteins indicated on the left in n. benthamiana and arabidopsis leaf epidermal cells . cytoplasmic localization of unfused _METHOD_ _METHOD_ in n. benthamiana and arabidopsis are shown as controls . scale . to confirm the localization patterns in arabidopsis individual transgenic arabidopsis lines _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus promoter were created and at least eight independent transgenic plants for each transgene were imaged . confirming the localization results obtained in the transient _PROTEIN_ experiment _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ showed the typical reticulate _LOCATION_ localization signals . the tdf domains of both proteins were sufficient to target _METHOD_ to the _LOCATION_ . deleting the tdf of _PROTEIN_ abolished the sharp reticulate localization pattern and led to a pattern very similar to that of free _METHOD_ . transgenic lines _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ could not be recovered possibly either because _PROTEIN_ is rapidly degraded or because its _PROTEIN_ is deleterious to plants . taken together the localization data from n. benthamiana and arabidopsis indicate that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are _LOCATION_ associated proteins and that the tdf domain is necessary and sufficient for _LOCATION_ localization . the position of the single transmembrane domain close to the c terminus the absence of any n terminal signal sequence and the targeting of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ to the _LOCATION_ by the tdf indicate that these proteins are tail anchored proteins . ta proteins are post translationally inserted into their target _LOCATION_ by a single transmembrane domain within the c terminal residues . ta proteins are characterized by n terminal functional domains facing the cytoplasm and a short c terminal tail protruding into the organellar lumen/matrix . in order to determine the topology of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ a protease protection assay was performed with isolated microsomes . microsomes were isolated from n. benthamiana leaves transiently _PROTEIN_ the fusion proteins _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . since the localization of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ _METHOD_ is similar to the localization of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in both n. benthamiana and arabidopsis the results from this experiment were used to infer the topology of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . _LOCATION_ resident _METHOD_ fusion proteins with known topology _METHOD_ calnexin _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _LOCATION_ and cxn photoactivatable _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ were used as controls . immunoblot analysis using an anti _METHOD_ antibody indicated that _METHOD_ in _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was hydrolyzed by proteinase k whereas the _METHOD_ facing the lumen in _METHOD_ cxn was protected from proteinase k and _METHOD_ facing the cytoplasm in cxn _METHOD_ was susceptible to proteinase k digestion . this demonstrates that the n terminal _METHOD_ tethered to the _LOCATION_ by _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ is facing the cytoplasm indicating that the n terminus of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ faces the cytoplasm . together these data suggest that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are _LOCATION_ localized tail anchored proteins with the n terminal long coiled coil domains facing the cytoplasm . immunoblot analysis using _METHOD_ antibody . microsomal preparations were treated with and without proteinase k. _METHOD_ cxn and cxn _METHOD_ were used as controls . in the microsome fraction containing _METHOD_ cxn _METHOD_ is protected from proteinase k treatment whereas _METHOD_ of cxn _METHOD_ is susceptible to proteinase k digestion . _METHOD_ of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ _METHOD_ are hydrolyzed indicating exposure to proteinase k. at the given concentration of proteinase k _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ a small amount of _METHOD_ remains undigested _METHOD_ . microsomal _LOCATION_ were solubilized by the detergent triton x . numbers on the left indicate approximate molecular _METHOD_ in kilodaltons . coiled coil proteins are known to form homo and hetero oligomers through specific interactions mediated by their coiled coil domains . since _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ have long coiled coil domains the proteins were tested for homo and heterodimerization using a split ubiquitin _LOCATION_ yeast two hybrid system . in the split ubiquitin system an artificial transcription _PROTEIN_ consisting of the lexa dna binding domain and the transactivator protein linked to c terminal moiety of ubiquitin is fused to one of the transmembrane proteins and n terminal moiety of ubiquitin is fused to the other transmembrane protein . when _PROTEIN_ alone the tf cub is anchored to the _LOCATION_ by the transmembrane protein and can not enter the _LOCATION_ to activate reporter genes . in the event of interaction with the protein fused to nub a reconstituted ubiquitin moiety is recognized by ubiquitin proteases thus releasing the tf to enter the _LOCATION_ and activate the _PROTEIN_ of reporter genes . to prevent spontaneous association between cub and nub the isoleucine at position in wild type nub was changed to glycine . therefore cub and the mutated nub can only reconstitute upon interaction between two proteins . to test for homo and heterodimerization cub and nub fusion proteins cub _PROTEIN_ cub _PROTEIN_ nubg _PROTEIN_ and nubg _PROTEIN_ were generated . pairwise interactions of _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ and homodimerization of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were tested in yeast by measuring the galactosidase activity of the lacz reporter . the interactions of cub _PROTEIN_ with nubg and cub _PROTEIN_ with nubg and of cub _PROTEIN_ and cub _PROTEIN_ with the unrelated protein nubg were used as negative controls . the results shown in indicate that _PROTEIN_ can form homodimers or homo oligomers while no evidence for either _PROTEIN_ homodimerization or interaction of _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ was observed in the yeast split ubiquitin system . galactosidase activity as a reporter for interaction in a _LOCATION_ yeast two hybrid assay . _PROTEIN_ shows self interaction as indicated by increased galactosidase activity in yeast containing the constructs cub _PROTEIN_ and nubg _PROTEIN_ . galactosidase activity in yeast transformed with combinations of cub _PROTEIN_ or cub _PROTEIN_ with either the empty vector nubg or the unrelated gene nubg were used as negative controls . combinations of cub _PROTEIN_ or cub _PROTEIN_ with fused to wild type nub were used as positive controls . a.u. arbitrary units . mean values and standard deviation from samples are shown . using the atgenexpress visualization tool we analyzed publicly available genome wide _PROTEIN_ data for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ during arabidopsis development . they indicate _PROTEIN_ of both genes in various organs during most stages of plant development with an overall higher level of _PROTEIN_ for _PROTEIN_ compared to _PROTEIN_ . to gain a more detailed impression of the spatial and temporal _PROTEIN_ pattern of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ arabidopsis transgenic plants carrying the reporter gene _PROTEIN_ driven by either kb upstream of the start codon _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ or kb upstream of the start codon of _PROTEIN_ were generated . the length of the putative promoters ppicl and ppicc were chosen based on the presence of other genes and their regulatory elements in the vicinity of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . at least five independent transgenic lines each were analyzed for gus activity in various organs during different stages of development from the seedling stage through flowering and maturation of seeds . ppicl gus _PROTEIN_ was detected in the vascular tissue of cotyledons and roots of day old seedlings in the vascular tissue of juvenile rosette leaves in the hydathodes of cotyledons and leaves and in nodal junctions . while ppicl gus _PROTEIN_ was restricted to vegetative organs ppicc gus showed a more ubiquitous _PROTEIN_ pattern . similar to ppicl gus ppicc gus _PROTEIN_ was detected in the vasculature of cotelydons and roots of day old seedlings in the vasculature of juvenile rosette leaves in the hydathodes of cotyledons and leaves and in nodal junctions . additionally _PROTEIN_ was observed in leaf trichomes and floral organs . in particular ppicc gus _PROTEIN_ was seen in the abscission zone at the base of flowers and siliques in the vasculature of sepals and _PROTEIN_ and in the stamens . taken together _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ have overlapping _PROTEIN_ patterns in the vegetative tissues and differential _PROTEIN_ patterns in the floral tissues . _PROTEIN_ staining indicating _PROTEIN_ promoter activity in the vasculature of cotyledons roots young and mature leaves in the hydathodes in the trichomes in the vasculature of sepals and _PROTEIN_ in the filaments of the anther in the stem and at the nodes and in the abscission zone of flowers and siliques . _PROTEIN_ staining indicating _PROTEIN_ promoter activity in the vasculature of cotyledons and young leaves in the vasculature of hypocotyls and roots in the hydathodes and at the nodes . no activity was visible in the buds flowers and siliques of the inflorescence . a reverse genetics approach was adopted to investigate the function of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . towards this end one t dna insertion allele for _PROTEIN_ picl and two t dna insertion alleles for _PROTEIN_ picc and picc were acquired from the _PROTEIN_ . picl has a t dna insertion in the last exon bp upstream of the region encoding the transmembrane domain . picc has an insertion within the exon . picc also has an insertion within the exon bp downstream of the picc insertion site . a rabbit polyclonal anti _PROTEIN_ antibody which recognizes both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ was generated using as antigen a aa epitope conserved in both the proteins . the anti _PROTEIN_ antibody detects the wild type _PROTEIN_ protein with an extrapolated _METHOD_ of kda and the wt _PROTEIN_ protein with an extrapolated _METHOD_ of kda . immunoblot analysis of protein extracts from the t dna insertion lines using the anti _PROTEIN_ antibody showed that a truncated _PROTEIN_ of kda and a truncated _PROTEIN_ of kda were produced in picl and picc plants whereas no _PROTEIN_ protein was detected in picc . the bands representing the truncated proteins were weaker than the wt _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ bands indicating reduced protein abundance in addition to truncation . moreover the insertion in picc results in the loss of of the _PROTEIN_ protein and hence picc is likely a functionally null allele . however the insertion in picl results in only a small c terminal truncation of _PROTEIN_ . based on the insertion site in picl we predicted that the transmembrane domain is not present in the truncated _PROTEIN_ protein . subcellular fractionation using total protein extracts of picl confirmed that tr.picl is soluble and not associated with _LOCATION_ . the loss of _LOCATION_ association of tr.picl in the picl mutant indicates that picl is a null allele for functions that require its insertion into the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . the major truncation and significantly reduced abundance of _PROTEIN_ in picc and the absence of detectable _PROTEIN_ in picc suggests that picc and picc are likely functionally null alleles . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are encoded by paralogous genes and have amino acid sequence identity as well as a similar domain structure localization and topology . therefore we predicted that there is a high probability of functional overlap between the two proteins . thus a picc picl double mutant was generated by crossing homozygous picc and picl mutant lines . since picc was the first allele to be selected most of our analysis was conducted with the picc mutant allele alongside picl wt and the double mutant picc picl . the appearance of the single mutants picc picc picl and the double mutant picc picl was indistinguishable from wt throughout the development of arabidopsis . plants in their natural environment are exposed to a variety of abiotic and biotic stress conditions such as drought high salinity temperature variations etc . therefore we investigated the response of picc picl and picc picl plants under osmotic and salt stress conditions . germination and post germination seedling growth were investigated on medium containing mm mm or mm nacl or mm mm or mm mannitol . picc picl and picc picl germination and seedling growth was indistinguishable from wt . to investigate hormonal stress response wt and mutant picc picc picl and picc picl seeds were analyzed for germination and post germination seedling growth on medium containing and abscisic acid . although the rate of germination of all the mutants was similar to wt all the mutant plants showed hypersensitivity to aba during the post germination growth . picc picc picl and picc picl showed a lower percentage of green and expanded cotyledons compared to the wt indicating a modulation in the post germination growth response to aba . wt picl picc picl picc and picc were grown on _METHOD_ plates containing different concentrations of aba . post germination growth efficiency was determined as percentage of green and expanded cotyledons at days after stratification . values represent average of three replicates where number of seeds in each replicate . _LOCATION_ bars represent one standard deviation . on plates containing aba wt and mutants had post germination growth efficiency . similar results were obtained in three out of four biological replicates . since _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ are localized at the _LOCATION_ in arabidopsis we investigated the _LOCATION_ morphology in picc picl double mutant plants . towards this end we transformed picc picl and wt plants with the _LOCATION_ marker hdel mcherry driven by the cauliflower mosaic virus promoter and imaged mcherry _METHOD_ using confocal laser scanning microscopy . the morphology of the cortical _LOCATION_ was highly similar in wt and picc picl . thus there is currently no evidence for an involvement of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in _LOCATION_ organization . based on _PROTEIN_ analysis of public microarray data _PROTEIN_ using the genevestigator database and analysis tools _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ appeared to be upregulated after treatment with . recognition of _PROTEIN_ on the bacteria by plant prrs induces global transcriptional changes in the plant . to confirm the induction of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ by quantitative rt pcr analysis was performed on rna extracted from seedlings and the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ was analyzed after and h continuous treatment with . consistent with the public microarray data _PROTEIN_ was induced after h and induction was further increased after h of treatment whereas _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was not changed . the transcription _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was included as a positive control gene known to be strongly induced by . day old liquid grown seedlings were treated with water or . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ steady state mrna levels were quantified by real time rt pcr at times indicated . _PROTEIN_ a known induced gene was used as a positive control . transcript levels were normalized to actin measured in the same samples . values are given in arbitrary units with _PROTEIN_ in h treated samples set to . each value is represented as the average of two biological replicates . _LOCATION_ bars represent one standard deviation . double asterisks indicate statistically significant difference in values compared to mock treated samples at the corresponding time point . to investigate whether _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is also induced by bacterial infection rosette leaves of week old plants grown in short day conditions were syringe infiltrated with either or the avirulent p. syringae strain hrcc or water or mm and the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ was analyzed at and hours post infiltration . _PROTEIN_ was induced by mock treatments peaking at hpi suggesting wounding may induce this gene . however _PROTEIN_ induction at hpi with both hrcc and treatments was significantly higher than with mock treatment . while _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ induced by mock treatment gradually _PROTEIN_ reaching basal levels at hpi _PROTEIN_ induction by and hrcc continued to remain significantly higher than the mock induction during all time points tested . consistent with the microarray data analysis and _PROTEIN_ analysis in seedlings _PROTEIN_ was not induced after and hrcc treatments confirming that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are differentially regulated during plant defense response . week old wt col plants were infiltrated with or cfu type iii secretion deficient hrcc . _PROTEIN_ steady state mrna levels were quantified by real time pcr at times indicated . transcript levels were normalized to actin levels from the same sample . values are given in arbitrary units with the value in h treated sample set to . each value is represented as the average of three biological replicates for treatment with and hrcc . _LOCATION_ bars represent one standard deviation . double and single asterisks indicate statistically significant difference in values compared to mock treated samples at the corresponding time point . based on the _PROTEIN_ induced _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ we hypothesized that picc mutant plants may be more susceptible to avirulent hrcc bacteria . to test this hypothesis the growth of the virulent pathogen and the nonvirulent pathogen hrcc was analyzed in wt picc picl and picc picl plants . rosette leaves were syringe infiltrated with colony forming units of bacterial suspensions of hrcc or mm . growth of bacteria was measured at days post infiltration . picc and picc picl plants supported as much as fold greater hrcc growth compared to wt while picl plants behaved like wt . in addition to picc we observed similar enhanced susceptibility to hrcc in the picc mutant . these results indicate a role for _PROTEIN_ in defense against hrcc . contrary to the result with hrcc no significant difference in the growth of was observed between wt and any of the mutant plants . we also conducted protection assay in which infection with is preceded by infiltration with the peptide . wt picl picc and picc picl mutant plants were syringe infiltrated with or water and h _PROTEIN_ were infiltrated with cfu of . bacterial growth was then assessed after days . growth of was equally reduced in all genotypes pre treated with compared to growth in mock treated plants indicating that this assay does not reveal compromised induced defenses in picc picl and picc picl mutant plants . levels of type iii secretion deficient hrcc and wild type four days after infiltration into leaves of the indicated plants . values represent average of three replicates . _LOCATION_ bars represent one standard deviation . increased growth of hrcc in picc and/or picc picl relative to wt was observed in out of biological replicates . cfu colony forming units . to investigate the effectiveness of _PROTEIN_ signaling in picc mutant plants and to narrow down the point of action of _PROTEIN_ we analyzed different _PROTEIN_ responses . _PROTEIN_ perception triggers a rapid burst of reactive oxygen species . ros generation occurs as an early response to _PROTEIN_ and is one hallmark of successful pathogen recognition and activation of defense responses . we examined ros production following treatment in picc and wt plants using a luminol based assay . picc plants did not show any significant difference in ros accumulation compared to wt plants indicating that _PROTEIN_ is not involved in induced accumulation of ros . to further investigate _PROTEIN_ responses we examined _PROTEIN_ induced gene _PROTEIN_ changes by q rt pcr . rosette leaves of wt and picc mutant plants were treated with or hrcc or water or mm and mrna was analyzed at or hpi . _PROTEIN_ is an early _PROTEIN_ induced transcription _PROTEIN_ essential for cell wall reinforcing callose deposition at the sites of infection . suppression of callose deposition is associated with increased growth of hrcc . as expected _PROTEIN_ induction was greater with and hrcc than with mock treatments . no significant difference in _PROTEIN_ induction was found between picc and wt plants indicating that _PROTEIN_ induced _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is not affected by loss of picc . analysis of the basal level of _PROTEIN_ indicated a slight increase in picc mutants compared to wt however the difference was not statistically significant . next we examined _PROTEIN_ induced salicylic acid accumulation and signaling through gene _PROTEIN_ analysis of the sa biosynthesis gene isochorismate synthase _PROTEIN_ and the classic read out for sa signal transduction _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ regulated gene _PROTEIN_ is partially dependent on _PROTEIN_ triggered sa accumulation which is important for _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was analyzed at and hpi . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was greater with and hrcc treatments at and hpi than with mock treatments in wt and picc . however no significant change was observed in picc mutants compared to wt . similarly _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ levels did not show any difference in picc plants compared to wt indicating that sa signaling leading to _PROTEIN_ gene _PROTEIN_ is not compromised in picc plants . previous studies have established a role for aba in pathogen response . an increase in aba levels increases a plant s susceptibility to pathogens . cis epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase _PROTEIN_ is a key enzyme in stress induced aba biosynthesis pathway . in light of the increased aba sensitivity in the post germination response of picc and picl mutants we tested if _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ levels are affected in the picc mutant . the levels of _PROTEIN_ transcript were investigated at and hpi after and hrcc treatments . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ levels showed no significant difference between wild type and picc mutants thus excluding a scenario of increased aba levels in picc resulting from an increase in the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ . collectively these data indicate that the branches of _PROTEIN_ leading to ros production and accumulation of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ transcripts are not compromised in picc mutant plants .

and were subsequently covered with a clear plastic dome to _PROTEIN_ humidity throughout the rest of the experiment under standard growth conditions . after days nine leaf discs for each infiltration were collected divided equally into three tubes containing mm each ground with pestles and serially diluted to measure bacterial numbers . for protection assays peptide was infiltrated into leaves h prior to infiltration with cfu of and growth was subsequently measured as described . for gene _PROTEIN_ studies in seedlings rna was isolated from day old seedlings grown in liquid _METHOD_ media and treated with _METHOD_ or water _METHOD_ for h h and h respectively . for _PROTEIN_ studies in arabidopsis plants leaves of week old arabidopsis plants grown in short day conditions were syringe infiltrated with or hrcc or water or mm . total rna was isolated using the rneasy plant mini kit and treated with dnase i . rna was quantified using a nanodrop . cdna was synthesized from of rna with the thermoscript rt cdna synthesis kit using an oligo dt primer . quantitative real time pcr was performed on a real time pcr detection system at the pmgf using the sybr green supermix . qpcr data was analyzed using the software and the graphs were generated using the graphpad prism software . p values were calculated based on two tail non parametric test using the graphpad prism software . actin was used as a control and the primers used for real time pcr analysis are listed in . ros accumulation measurements were performed as described . leaf discs from week old plants were excised and floated on distilled water overnight . three leaf discs each were then transferred into a tube containing luminol solution immun star hrp substrate of horseradish peroxidase streptavidin _PROTEIN_ and of mm or water . luminescence was measured using a glomax luminometer every s until readings were recorded . three technical repeats were performed for each genotype and treatment . the experiment was reproduced in three biological replicates . the values were calculated with luminescence intensity of wt set to . coiled coil predictions were carried out using multicoil . transmembrane domain predictions were carried out using the tmhmm server . sequence alignments were generated using the muscle sequence alignment server and the alignment figure was generated using texshade . the phylogenetic tree was generated using phylogeny.fr .
