arabidopsis mitochondria are predicted to contain three acyl carrier proteins _PROTEIN_ . these small proteins are involved in fatty acid and lipoic acid synthesis in other _METHOD_ and have been previously reported to be subunits of respiratory complex i in mitochondria in mammals fungi and plants . recently the mammalian mitochondrial _PROTEIN_ has been shown to be largely a soluble _PROTEIN_ protein but also to be minimally associated with complex i consistent with its involvement in synthesis of lipoic acid for tca cycle decarboxylating dehydrogenases in the _PROTEIN_ but contrary to earlier _METHOD_ it was primarily a complex i subunit . we have investigated the localization of the _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis mitochondria . evidence is presented that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ dominate the _PROTEIN_ composition in arabidopsis mitochondria and both are present in the mitochondrial _PROTEIN_ rather than in the _LOCATION_ . no significant amounts of mtacps were detected in complex i isolated by blue native gel electrophoresis rather mtacps were detected at low molecular _METHOD_ in the soluble fraction showing that in a. thaliana mtacps are predominately free soluble _PROTEIN_ proteins .
the genome of a. thaliana putatively encodes mitochondrial _METHOD_ of _PROTEIN_ namely _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . the analysis of the est data shows that _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ > _PROTEIN_ > _PROTEIN_ . on microarrays _PROTEIN_ is barely detectible with an average signal intensity of less than while _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ have average signals of over . analysis of _PROTEIN_ data for the three genes shows a ratio of for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ respectively for the abundance of unique signature sequences across different developmental tissues . altogether these data indicated that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are the _PROTEIN_ mtacps in arabidopsis as they are much more _PROTEIN_ than _PROTEIN_ . it is presumed based on antibody studies and by similarity to complex i subunits in mammals that at least one mtacp is a subunit of complex i in protist and in plants . in neurospora crassa loss of _PROTEIN_ leads to loss of assembly of complex i . if a mtacp is present in arabidopsis complex i or linked to complex i function its gene would likely be co _PROTEIN_ with genes encoding complex i subunits . we looked for genes co _PROTEIN_ with the mtacps genes by using _PROTEIN_ ii . this software uses public microarray data and calculates the average _PROTEIN_ correlation to a query gene . the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ is correlated with the _PROTEIN_ of a number of genes encoding complex i subunits but this list also contains other respiratory complex subunits from the _PROTEIN_ synthase and cytochrome c oxidase . on the other hand _PROTEIN_ is not co _PROTEIN_ with complex i and with very few other respiratory chain complexes subunits . similarly _PROTEIN_ is co _PROTEIN_ with only gene encoding a complex i subunit . these data show that among the mtacps _PROTEIN_ is the most likely to be linked functionally or structurally with complex i . all three mtacps are consistently co _PROTEIN_ with genes encoding ribosomal proteins and mitochondrial import translocases components all proteins that have a housekeeping function for mitochondrial function and proliferation . thus mtacps might have a housekeeping function which would be consistent with a role in fatty acid or lipoic acid biosynthesis . moreover _PROTEIN_ could be involved in a more specific function that would be related to respiratory complexes biogenesis as postulated previously in n. crassa . in bovine mtacp that was originally identified in complex i was recently reported as mostly a soluble protein of the _PROTEIN_ . as no mtacps were identified in the analysis of arabidopsis complex i composition we decided to investigate the localisation of mtacp within arabidopsis mitochondria . we obtained antibodies raised against arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ . these antibodies have been previously used to show that a mtacp was associated with purified potato complex i . we isolated mitochondria from arabidopsis cell culture and fractionated them into a soluble and a _LOCATION_ fraction . a western blot using the anti _PROTEIN_ antibodies show that more than of _PROTEIN_ is present in the soluble fraction . the lowest band presumably corresponds to the acylated form of mtacp described previously . the _LOCATION_ fraction was free of soluble proteins as no signal was detected for the h protein of the glycine decarboxylase complex stained using an antibody directed against the lipoic acid . no detergent were used during the fractionation process so it is very unlikely that complex i was solubilized or that a sub complex of complex i was released in the soluble fraction . this was confirmed by the control western blot using anti _PROTEIN_ antibodies . _PROTEIN_ is a subunit of complex i that is located in the _PROTEIN_ arm of this complex . as of _PROTEIN_ was present in the _LOCATION_ fraction complex i was not significantly dissociated by the fractionation . thus the soluble form of _PROTEIN_ detected are not a by product of complex i disruption . the controls used show that even though the soluble fraction is slightly contaminated with the _LOCATION_ fraction this can not explain the levels of mtacp immuno detected in the soluble fraction if this protein was a _LOCATION_ protein . thus it appears the _PROTEIN_ proteins detected by the _PROTEIN_ antibodies are predominantly soluble proteins in mitochondria . in order to define whether the _PROTEIN_ was also recognized by the antibodies we loaded the soluble and the _LOCATION_ fractions on dimensional gels . after transfer of the proteins on a _LOCATION_ and western blotting with the anti _PROTEIN_ antibodies two proteins were stained by the antibodies in the soluble fraction but not in the _LOCATION_ fraction . we used _METHOD_ _METHOD_ in an attempt to identify the proteins recognized by the antibodies . no specific peptides corresponding to _PROTEIN_ were identified in the analysis of the two immunodetected spots . the lower molecular weight protein was identified as _PROTEIN_ indicating that the antibodies are able to recognized _PROTEIN_ . the higher molecular weight protein was not a visible spot on the total protein stained gel and yielded no significant match in _METHOD_ _METHOD_ analysis . the surrounding visible spots present at the vicinity of antibody staining were also analysed and identified by _METHOD_ _METHOD_ but none represented _PROTEIN_ . as the spot corresponding to _PROTEIN_ is not visible in the _LOCATION_ fraction we conclude that _PROTEIN_ is a protein mostly found in the soluble fraction of mitochondria . we also investigated the proteomes of the _PROTEIN_ and of the inner mitochondrial _LOCATION_ by a non gel complex mixture lc _METHOD_ analysis . the only mtacp specifically detected was _PROTEIN_ it was identified in the _PROTEIN_ fractions of three independent analyses but not in three inner _LOCATION_ fractions . in contrast of the subunits of complex i detected in the _LOCATION_ fractions only two were detected in the soluble fraction and these were found as fewer peptides with lower scores in the _METHOD_ spectral analysis suggesting much lower abundance of these subunits in the soluble fraction . altogether these results indicate that _PROTEIN_ is present predominantly in the soluble rather than _LOCATION_ fraction of mitochondria and the antibodies specifically raised to _PROTEIN_ recognize two proteins one is _PROTEIN_ and both cross reacting proteins are soluble rather than in the _LOCATION_ . in order to investigate the possibility in arabidopsis that a small proportion of _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ might be a complex i subunit we separated the soluble and _LOCATION_ fraction extracted from arabidopsis mitochondria by blue native electrophoresis . the complexes were transferred on a _LOCATION_ and probed with anti _PROTEIN_ antibodies . no complexes containing mtacp were detected in the _LOCATION_ fraction whereas a kda complex appeared to be detected in the soluble fraction . as some antigens might be hidden under native conditions we ran a second dimension to separate the different subunits present in the complexes of the _LOCATION_ fraction . after transfer of the soluble proteins onto a pvdf _LOCATION_ and blotting with the anti _PROTEIN_ antibodies only a very faint signal at the vertical position corresponding to the apparent kda complex was detected on the second dimension . the major immune signal was detected in the bottom of the bn gel where proteins are not associated in complexes . this result was obtained in multiple experiments from samples run in bn gels and replicate lanes from the same bn gel blotted or run in bn _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ gels and blotted . it appears that the anti _PROTEIN_ antibodies faintly recognize a native epitope present in the major _PROTEIN_ complex in the soluble extract but this epitope is lost in denaturing conditions while the _PROTEIN_ antigens recognized by the antibodies are not accessible under the native conditions but are revealed on subsequent _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . a similar analysis of the _LOCATION_ proteins revealed the typical pattern of high molecular _METHOD_ respiratory complexes but anti mtacp antibodies failed to recognize any bands on the bn _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . this result coupled to our previously published systematic analysis of the complex i by _METHOD_ _METHOD_ that failed to find either mtacp indicate that _PROTEIN_ is almost certainly not a complex i subunit in arabidopsis mitochondria and that there is still no real evidence other than hints from co _PROTEIN_ analysis that _PROTEIN_ in linked physically or functionally to complex i .
