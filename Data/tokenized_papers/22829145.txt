position dependent patterning of hair and non hair cells in the arabidopsis thaliana root epidermis is a powerful system to study the molecular basis of cell fate specification . here we report an epidermal patterning mutant affecting the adenosine _PROTEIN_ transferase _PROTEIN_ rrna dimethylase gene predicted to participate in rrna posttranscriptional processing and base modification . consistent with a role in ribosome biogenesis _PROTEIN_ is preferentially _PROTEIN_ in regions of rapid growth and its product is _LOCATION_ localized with nucleolus enrichment . furthermore _PROTEIN_ preferentially accumulates in the developing hair cells and the _PROTEIN_ point mutant alters the cell specific _PROTEIN_ of the transcriptional regulators caprice and _PROTEIN_ . together these findings suggest that establishment of cell specific gene _PROTEIN_ during root epidermis development is dependent upon proper ribosome biogenesis possibly due to the sensitivity of the cell fate decision to relatively small differences in gene regulatory activities . consistent with its effect on the predicted s adenosyl l met binding site _PROTEIN_ plants lack the two rrna base modifications but exhibit normal pre rrna processing . in addition to root epidermal defects the _PROTEIN_ mutant exhibits abnormal root meristem division leaf development and trichome branching . together these findings provide new insights into the importance of rrna base modifications and translation regulation for plant growth and development .
a recessive mutant preliminarily designated was identified in a forward genetic screen for root epidermal patterning defects among ethyl methanesulfonate mutagenized plants _PROTEIN_ the non hair cell specific reporter _PROTEIN_ gus _PROTEIN_ . the mutant was found to _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ gus in a pattern that is not strictly associated with the position of epidermal cells relative to the underlying cortical cells . in wild type roots of developing epidermal cells in the h position lack _PROTEIN_ gus _PROTEIN_ and of cells in the n position _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ gus . in roots only of developing epidermal cells in the h position lack _PROTEIN_ gus and of cells in the n position _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ gus . accordingly in the mature portion of the root the mutant displays a significant increase in the frequency of non hair cells in h cell files . the _PROTEIN_ root phenotype was variable with some roots appearing nearly normal and others exhibiting severe defects in epidermal pattern yet the average difference between the _PROTEIN_ and the wild type was statistically significant . a map based cloning approach was taken to identify the gene affected by the _PROTEIN_ mutation . using bulk segregant analysis of pools followed by detailed mapping with simple sequence length polymorphism cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence and derived cleaved amplified polymorphic sequences primers we narrowed the mutation to an kb region containing genes . sequence analysis of genes in this region identified a g to a change in locus _GENE_ at position which causes a predicted gly to glu missense at position in the gene product . to verify that the mutation in this locus caused the mutant phenotype a construct containing a full length genomic fragment of _GENE_ was stably transformed into plants . this construct fully complemented the _PROTEIN_ gus cell type _PROTEIN_ defect of the mutant indicating that the phenotypic defects seen in result from the single base change identified in locus _GENE_ . as the _GENE_ gene was previously designated _PROTEIN_ we refer to the mutant as _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ encodes a putative rrna s adenosyl l met dependent adenosine dimethyltransferase . it exhibits extensive sequence similarity to members of the family of rrna dimethylases including the well characterized _PROTEIN_ in s. cerevisiae and ksga in escherichia coli . these enzymes catalyze the methylation of two adjacent conserved adenosines at the end of rrna or rrna and are involved in processing of precursor rrna to generate mature rrna for subunit assembly . the arabidopsis genome encodes a total of three rrna dimethylase enzymes _PROTEIN_ described here _PROTEIN_ a _LOCATION_ localized enzyme important for cold tolerance and _PROTEIN_ a mitochondrial localized enzyme recently shown to methylate mitochondrial rrna . thus _PROTEIN_ appears to be the only rrna dimethylase in arabidopsis devoted to the biogenesis of _LOCATION_ derived ribosomes . the _PROTEIN_ missense mutation alters a conserved gly residue within the canonical sam binding sequence shown in bacterial ksga to form part of the cofactor binding pocket . considering this we hypothesized that the _PROTEIN_ gene may be _PROTEIN_ normally and its product may process pre rrna normally but it may have altered methylation ability due to the change in its predicted sam binding sequence . as a first test of this hypothesis we used rt pcr to analyze _PROTEIN_ rna accumulation and we found similar transcript levels in _PROTEIN_ and wild type seedlings indicating that the _PROTEIN_ gene is transcribed normally in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . to assess the methylation status of the two adjacent adenosines at the end of rrna in _PROTEIN_ and the wild type we used a primer extension experiment which takes advantage of the inability of reverse transcriptase to extend an oligonucleotide past a n dimethylated adenosine . using rna from wild type plants primer extension was inhibited at the rrna bases and indicating that these adenosines possess the n dimethylations . however using rna from _PROTEIN_ the primer extension reaction proceeded beyond and terminating at as a result of inclusion of ddatp instead of datp in the nucleotide mixture to force the reaction to stop at a measurable distance . this result indicates that _PROTEIN_ is necessary for the n dimethylation of the adenosines at positions and of the rrna and that disruption of a single conserved gly within the sam binding domain is sufficient to abolish this methylation . yeast _PROTEIN_ is required not only for rrna adenosine dimethylation but also for pre rrna processing and these two functions are separable . to determine whether the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ mutation affects rrna processing we used an rt pcr based assay with primers designed to flank the putative processing sites . the results show that similar levels of unprocessed external transcribed spacer are detected from wild type and _PROTEIN_ seedling tissue suggesting that the _PROTEIN_ mutation affects rrna dimethylation but not pre rrna processing . the results described above suggest that aberrant ribosome formation may be responsible for the root development defects in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . to explore this possibility further we analyzed the effect of cycloheximide a specific inhibitor of eukaryotic cytoplasmic ribosome function on root epidermal patterning in wild type seedlings . using a concentration of cycloheximide that affected root growth to the same extent as the _PROTEIN_ mutant on unsupplemented media we observed a significant change in the specification of the hair and non hair cell types . this suggests that the abnormal patterning in _PROTEIN_ is due at least in part to abnormal cytoplasmic ribosome function . to investigate the transcriptional control of the _PROTEIN_ gene a _PROTEIN_ promoter gus fusion construct _PROTEIN_ gus was generated and characterized . this construct was made with the same promoter region shown to complement the _PROTEIN_ mutation when driving _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ coding region . examination of independent transgenic lines showed that _PROTEIN_ gus _PROTEIN_ was detectable at the tips of emerging d old roots with the strongest _PROTEIN_ in the epidermis and vasculature . the level of epidermal _PROTEIN_ was greatest in the meristematic region with cell to cell variability within each individual root that did not appear to be related to cell type or position . in older roots the level of _PROTEIN_ gus _PROTEIN_ was diminished and restricted to the vasculature and _PROTEIN_ root primordia when roots were stained for shorter times but _PROTEIN_ was detected in all root meristematic cells upon longer incubation times . in developing cotyledons and leaves _PROTEIN_ gus _PROTEIN_ was observed at the tip of the leaves as well as in the vascular tissue . _PROTEIN_ gus was _PROTEIN_ throughout floral tissue particularly in the vasculature of _PROTEIN_ anther and pollen and was enriched in stem vasculature and the silique abscission zone . as an independent assessment of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ we analyzed _PROTEIN_ transcript accumulation data from available arabidopsis microarray datasets including genevestigator and the _METHOD_ database _METHOD_ . these data indicate that _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ in rapidly dividing regions of the plant such as embryonic tissue leaf primordia and root _METHOD_ . within the root meristem _PROTEIN_ rna accumulates in all tissues with its abundance diminishing as the tissues mature _METHOD_ . these findings largely confirm our reporter _PROTEIN_ data . to examine the subcellular and organ wide distribution of the _PROTEIN_ protein we generated a c terminal green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ translational fusion construct of the _PROTEIN_ coding region driven by the _PROTEIN_ promoter . when introduced into the _PROTEIN_ mutant this _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ construct fully complemented the _PROTEIN_ mutant phenotypes suggesting that the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein is functional . confocal imaging revealed that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was localized primarily in root cell _LOCATION_ most strongly in subnuclear regions presumed to be the nucleolus . this result is consistent with recent work showing nucleolar localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transiently _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis protoplasts and predominantly nucleolar localization of _PROTEIN_ in yeast . at an organ wide level _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was observed in all tissue types in the developing root . a comparison of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ to _PROTEIN_ gus results indicates considerable overlap in root cells _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ promoter and accumulating _PROTEIN_ protein although _PROTEIN_ protein appears to persist in differentiated root cells that lack detectable _PROTEIN_ promoter activity . interestingly in the root epidermis _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ appeared to accumulate and persist to a greater extent in the h position cells than in the n position cells _METHOD_ . this is likely a posttranscriptional effect since differential _PROTEIN_ gus _PROTEIN_ was not observed and it may reflect a preferential requirement for _PROTEIN_ and/or ribosome function in the differentiation of root hair cells . in other species excessive production of a normal or catalytically inactive member of the protein family can affect growth or viability . to assess the effect of excessive _PROTEIN_ or mutant _PROTEIN_ protein in arabidopsis we overexpressed c terminal _METHOD_ fusion constructs of the _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ alleles using the strong cauliflower mosaic virus promoter . each of these constructs _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were introduced into wild type and _PROTEIN_ mutant plants and multiple homozygous transgenic lines were analyzed for each combination . in the _PROTEIN_ mutant background overexpressing the _PROTEIN_ mutant did not have any impact on epidermal patterning while overexpressing the wild type _PROTEIN_ essentially complemented the _PROTEIN_ mutant phenotype . in the wild type background overexpressing either wild type _PROTEIN_ or mutant _PROTEIN_ had little or no effect on epidermal patterning or overall plant development . overall the results from these overexpression experiments suggest that in plants an excessive amount of the normal _PROTEIN_ or methylase deficient version of _PROTEIN_ protein does not affect epidermal patterning or meristem development . our initial analyses showed that the _PROTEIN_ mutant affects the position dependent pattern of _PROTEIN_ gus reporter _PROTEIN_ in the root epidermis . to define the role of _PROTEIN_ further we analyzed the effect of _PROTEIN_ on the _PROTEIN_ of the hair cell reporter _PROTEIN_ gus and the non hair cell reporters _PROTEIN_ gus and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ which were independently introduced into the _PROTEIN_ mutant by crossing . in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ gus plants we did not observe a significant change in the amount or pattern of gus activity in the root epidermis . this suggests that the cell position dependent regulation and _PROTEIN_ level of _PROTEIN_ in the root epidermis does not require wild type _PROTEIN_ . in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ gus plants we observed a severe reduction in gus activity in the root epidermis compared with wild type plants although the characteristic _PROTEIN_ of this gus reporter in the developing vascular tissue was still present . after a long staining period we did observe weak _PROTEIN_ promoter activity in the root epidermis . these results show that _PROTEIN_ is necessary for proper epidermal cell _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ . in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ line we observed the usual non hair specific pattern of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ reporter but we noticed a difference in the relative abundance of _METHOD_ accumulation in cells located in the h and n files relative to the wild type _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ line . quantification of the level of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ performed by measuring pixel content in individual cells in the upper one third of the root meristem revealed a significant reduction in the n/h cell ratio of _METHOD_ in _PROTEIN_ compared with the wild type due to an almost twofold increase in _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in the h file cells of _PROTEIN_ . these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ is required to establish or _PROTEIN_ the high n/h ratio of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ during root epidermis cell specification . the results described above suggest that _PROTEIN_ is required for proper specification of the hair cell fate through its effects on _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . to analyze further the effect of _PROTEIN_ on epidermal cell fate specification we introduced the _PROTEIN_ mutation into the wer scm and _PROTEIN_ single mutant and _PROTEIN_ double mutant backgrounds in the presence of the _PROTEIN_ gus reporter to investigate possible genetic interactions . _PROTEIN_ is necessary for specification of the non hair cell fate and for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ as illustrated by the excess root hairs and reduced _PROTEIN_ gus _PROTEIN_ in the wer mutant . interestingly we found that the wer _PROTEIN_ double mutant contained dramatically more _PROTEIN_ gus _PROTEIN_ epidermal cells than the wer single mutant . specifically we found that only of wer _PROTEIN_ roots completely lacked _PROTEIN_ gus _PROTEIN_ meristematic epidermal cells compared with of wer roots . furthermore while only of wer mutant roots had more than five _PROTEIN_ gus _PROTEIN_ epidermal cells of wer _PROTEIN_ roots showed more than five _PROTEIN_ gus _PROTEIN_ cells . consistent with its increased _PROTEIN_ promoter activity the wer _PROTEIN_ double mutant had significantly fewer root hair cells than the wer mutant due to a reduction in the fraction of n position cells that differentiate into hair cells . these additive genetic interactions suggest that wer and _PROTEIN_ mutations affect root epidermal cell specification in opposing ways with wer promoting the hair pathway and _PROTEIN_ the non hair pathway . the _PROTEIN_ leucine rich repeat receptor like kinase is required for epidermal cells to interpret their position relative to underlying cortical cells and mutations in scm like _PROTEIN_ result in a disorganized pattern of specified cell fates . following the introduction of _PROTEIN_ into the scm loss of function mutant we discovered a partial rescue of the scm epidermal cell type patterning phenotype by _PROTEIN_ . the double mutant showed a slight reduction in _PROTEIN_ gus _PROTEIN_ cells in the h position from in scm to in scm _PROTEIN_ and a greater reduction in _PROTEIN_ gus nonexpressing cells in the n position from in scm to in scm _PROTEIN_ . the inclusion of the _PROTEIN_ mutation in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or mutant backgrounds did not alter their _PROTEIN_ gus root _PROTEIN_ phenotypes compared with the respective single mutant phenotypes which suggests a lack of genetic interaction between _PROTEIN_ and these patterning genes . primary roots of _PROTEIN_ seedlings are shorter than wild type seedlings due to an reduction in root growth rate . quantitative analysis of root epidermal cell length showed that _PROTEIN_ does not differ significantly from the wild type implicating reduced cell production rather than reduced cell size as the primary cause for its _PROTEIN_ root length and growth rate . examination of root _METHOD_ revealed a reduction in cell number in _PROTEIN_ . compared with wild type roots the _PROTEIN_ mutant meristematic region contained of the h position epidermal cells of the n position epidermal cells and of the cortical cells . interestingly the cells observed in the _PROTEIN_ meristematic region were longer than their wild type counterparts suggesting diminished cell division activity . to assess the relative rate of cell division within the meristem we examined epidermal clones in wild type and _PROTEIN_ roots . these clones arise from rare longitudinal oriented divisions of epidermal cells within the meristem that produce a recognizable pair of short cell files within a single cell file with the final cell number in the clone dictated by the number of rounds of cell division that occur . examination of more than clones each from wild type and from _PROTEIN_ roots suggest a reduced cell division rate in the _PROTEIN_ clones . the most frequent type of clone in wild type root _METHOD_ was derived from five rounds of division whereas the most frequent _PROTEIN_ clone was due to three rounds of division . additionally while of wild type clones were class six we only observed one class six clone in _PROTEIN_ roots . together these results indicate that cell division is reduced in the _PROTEIN_ roots . to determine whether the reduced cell division rate in the _PROTEIN_ mutant might be responsible for its epidermal cell patterning defect we analyzed the pattern of _PROTEIN_ gus reporter _PROTEIN_ in wild type roots treated to inhibit cell division . for this purpose we used hygromycin streptomycin puromycin and tetracycline which were all effective in reducing cell number in the root epidermis . however none of these treatments significantly affected the _PROTEIN_ gus _PROTEIN_ pattern suggesting that the epidermal cell type patterning defect in the _PROTEIN_ mutant can not be mimicked by merely inhibiting meristem cell division . we observed other morphological defects in the _PROTEIN_ mutant including pointed leaves reduced leaf size and disrupted leaf venation . these phenotypes are similar to ones observed in other arabidopsis ribosome assembly _PROTEIN_ mutants including nuc and _PROTEIN_ as well as the phenotypes of arabidopsis ribosomal protein mutants including _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . interestingly we did not detect a difference in leaf cell shape or stomatal development as observed in other ribosomal mutants . however we did detect a reduction in trichome branching in the _PROTEIN_ mutant suggesting that functional _PROTEIN_ may be needed for normal trichome development .
