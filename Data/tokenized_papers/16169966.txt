controversy exists in the literature over the involvement of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ in the delivery of _LOCATION_ proteins to _LOCATION_ . in this study the involvement of the _LOCATION_ in the trafficking of two arabidopsis peroxisomal _LOCATION_ proteins was investigated using confocal laser scanning microscopy of living cells _PROTEIN_ fusions between enhanced yellow _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . the fusion proteins were always detected in _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ irrespective of the location of the _METHOD_ tag or the level of _PROTEIN_ . the _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ was not due to cleavage of the _METHOD_ reporter from the c terminal fusion proteins . blocking known _LOCATION_ transport routes using the fungal metabolite brefeldin a or _PROTEIN_ dominant negative mutants of _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ had no effect on the trafficking of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ to _LOCATION_ . we conclude that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are inserted into _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ directly from the _LOCATION_ .
both n and c terminal fusions of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ to enhanced yellow _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ were _PROTEIN_ under the control of the promoter . all four fusion proteins were located in punctate motile structures and to some extent in the _LOCATION_ when _PROTEIN_ transiently in tobacco epidermal cells . a peroxisomal _PROTEIN_ marker _METHOD_ fused to skl _METHOD_ colocalized with both n and c terminal _PROTEIN_ fusions to _METHOD_ . additionally _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ fusions to _METHOD_ were frequently localized to the rim of the _LOCATION_ with the _PROTEIN_ marker inside the _LOCATION_ structure . stable transgenic tobacco and arabidopsis lines _PROTEIN_ either _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were generated to determine whether a similar distribution of the fusion proteins was seen compared to transient _PROTEIN_ in epidermal cells . stable arabidopsis plants _PROTEIN_ both _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ skl also show that _PROTEIN_ is present in the periphery of _LOCATION_ . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ is also present in punctate motile structures in stable arabidopsis and tobacco lines . transgenic tobacco plants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ displayed lower levels of _PROTEIN_ than _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ plants . however more _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was present in the periphery of punctate motile structures the size of _LOCATION_ than was seen under transient _PROTEIN_ . stable arabidopsis plants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ show that _PROTEIN_ is present in the motile punctate structures of the expected size of _LOCATION_ . with all constructs _PROTEIN_ under both transient and stable transformation diffuse nonperoxisomal _METHOD_ was seen to differing extents . nonperoxisomal _METHOD_ as well as representing the full length fusion protein could be due to cleavage of the _METHOD_ from the fusion proteins leading to accumulation of _METHOD_ protein in the _LOCATION_ . an anti green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ antibody which cross reacts with _METHOD_ was used to probe leaf extracts derived from stable tobacco transformants that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . leaf extracts from untransformed tobacco were used as controls . a band was detected in lane indicated by an arrowhead which was slightly smaller than the expected size of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . however it is known that _LOCATION_ proteins often migrate anomalously in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ gels . in lane a slightly smaller band was detected indicated by an arrow consistent with the smaller size of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . neither band was seen in the untransformed sample . figure shows the ponceau s stained blot corresponding to figure . this _METHOD_ that the amount of protein from the wild type plants was similar to or greater than the amount of protein from the transgenic samples . thus the absence of anti _METHOD_ cross reactive bands around kd in the wild type sample _METHOD_ that the bands of this size seen in the transformed samples are the _METHOD_ fusion proteins . total protein extracts from stable tobacco plants _PROTEIN_ either _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were probed with the anti _METHOD_ antibody . _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ is not stable and both the full length and cleaved _METHOD_ were detected . crucially there was no band corresponding to free _METHOD_ at around kd in total protein extracts from _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . the band around kd detected in all extracts does not represent free _METHOD_ as it was also detected in protein extracts from wild type plants . therefore both _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ are stable fusion proteins and were used for subsequent experiments . polyclonal serum was raised against a amino acid peptide corresponding to the amino terminus of _PROTEIN_ . the resulting antibodies were affinity purified using the peptide . due to the low levels of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in the stable tobacco line the affinity purified antibody was used to probe total protein extracts from tobacco plants transiently _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ under the control of the enhanced promoter . nontransformed tissue was used as a control . the affinity purified antibody cross reacts with a product close to the predicted size for native _PROTEIN_ kd in both lanes and and a band corresponding to the fusion protein _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in lane only . to confirm antibody specificity the affinity purified antibody was preincubated with peptide to titrate out the antibody . the samples loaded in lanes and are identical where lane was detected with affinity purified antibody and lane was detected with affinity purified antiserum preincubated with peptide . as expected the level of _PROTEIN_ detected in lane is significantly less than in lane . an additional weaker cross reactivity with a product around kd was also detected . _METHOD_ on arabidopsis cell culture using the _PROTEIN_ affinity purified antibody results in punctate labeling similar to that observed using antibodies against isocitrate lyase _PROTEIN_ . additionally there was no evidence of _LOCATION_ or reticular staining with the anti _PROTEIN_ antibody . dual labeling resulted in several punctate structures labeling with both anti _PROTEIN_ and anti _PROTEIN_ antibodies . to ascertain whether _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ traffic via the _LOCATION_ the first step was to determine whether the nonperoxisomal _METHOD_ colocalizes with an _LOCATION_ marker _METHOD_ hdel . the cortical _LOCATION_ network in tobacco leaf epidermal cells _METHOD_ an extensive network of polygonal tubules surrounded by the cytoplasm . these cells contain large _LOCATION_ that confine the cytoplasm and organelles to the periphery of the cell . these spatial constrictions can restrict the _LOCATION_ to the region immediately surrounding the _LOCATION_ network resulting in a similar yet diffuse pattern of _METHOD_ or it can flow freely around other organelles in the cell which appear in negative contrast . therefore to be able to discern between _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ location requires careful inspection and interpretation of the images . n or c terminal fusions of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ to _METHOD_ were transiently _PROTEIN_ in stable tobacco plants _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ hdel . the settings used on the microscope could distinguish between _METHOD_ from _METHOD_ fusions and that from wild type _METHOD_ fused to hdel . _METHOD_ hdel labels the well defined cortical _LOCATION_ network and is seen in close association with the _LOCATION_ containing the fusion protein and the diffuse pool of peroxisomal fusion proteins . careful analysis of the peroxisomal fusion proteins _PROTEIN_ in the _METHOD_ hdel plants showed that they did not colocalize with the _LOCATION_ but rather surrounded it in a diffuse pattern like that of free _METHOD_ . this _LOCATION_ nature was further supported by observations of organelles in negative contrast . similarly epidermal cells in stable transgenic lines _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ do not show _LOCATION_ localization . however it is possible that the kinetics of trafficking may be such that the steady state levels of these peroxisomal proteins in the _LOCATION_ are below detection or that low levels in the _LOCATION_ may be masked by the levels in the _LOCATION_ . to address this the export of proteins from the _LOCATION_ was blocked and the effect on trafficking of the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ fusion proteins investigated . comparisons between transient and steady state _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ have shown that higher levels of the fusion protein are present in the _LOCATION_ and less is detected in the _LOCATION_ in stably transformed lines . therefore subsequent studies relating to _PROTEIN_ trafficking were carried out using stable tobacco plants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ since high _LOCATION_ levels detected under transient _PROTEIN_ could mask populations of fusion protein which may locate to the _LOCATION_ upon treatment with bfa or _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . studies involving _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and a peroxisomal _PROTEIN_ marker _METHOD_ skl are based on transient _PROTEIN_ of these fusion proteins . treatment of cells with bfa results in the redistribution of _LOCATION_ markers back to the _LOCATION_ . this is thought to be due to the disruption of _PROTEIN_ mediated trafficking at the _LOCATION_ and/or _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ interface . therefore to assess what role _PROTEIN_ vesicular traffic may play in the trafficking of peroxisomal markers _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and a peroxisomal _PROTEIN_ marker _METHOD_ skl were coexpressed with a _LOCATION_ marker protein and treated with bfa . tobacco epidermal cells transiently _PROTEIN_ a _LOCATION_ marker sialyltransferase fused to _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and a peroxisomal marker were treated with bfa for min . the _LOCATION_ marker acts as an internal control as bfa treatment should result in the redistribution of this marker to the _LOCATION_ . images were taken prior to bfa treatment and then after min incubation in bfa . figure shows that prior to treatment _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and the peroxisomal markers _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and a peroxisomal _PROTEIN_ marker _METHOD_ skl label punctate structures . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and the peroxisomal markers do not colocalize and are present in two separate populations of punctate structures which represent the _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ . after min treatment the peroxisomal markers are still in motile punctate structures whereas the _LOCATION_ marker _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ has been redistributed to the _LOCATION_ . the peroxisomal markers in merged images are shown for clarity in a single channel image . the affects of bfa are reversed after h incubation in water . the effects of bfa treatment on _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ trafficking are shown in supplemental movie . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are small g proteins involved in _LOCATION_ to _LOCATION_ transport . transient _PROTEIN_ of a _PROTEIN_ locked mutant or arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ a nucleotide free mutant resulted in the accumulation of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ a _LOCATION_ marker and a secreted form of _METHOD_ sec _METHOD_ in the _LOCATION_ . this in vivo assay _METHOD_ the basis for assessing the potential effects of blocking _LOCATION_ to _LOCATION_ trafficking on _LOCATION_ biogenesis as the altered location of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion acts as a marker for the _PROTEIN_ of the dominant negative _METHOD_ of the g proteins _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . in cells where _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was coexpressed with either _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ skl the _LOCATION_ markers were detected in distinct cellular structures . coexpression of the _PROTEIN_ mutant had no effect on the localization of the peroxisomal markers but did affect _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ as expected . for clarity images in figure g to i show the peroxisomal markers in figure d to f. _LOCATION_ containing the _METHOD_ fusion proteins in cells that coexpress _PROTEIN_ are similar in size and display similar movement characteristics to cells not _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ mutant . cells coexpressing the _PROTEIN_ mutant with the peroxisomal markers and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ are shown in figure j to o . the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _LOCATION_ marker control is located in the _LOCATION_ due to the effects of _PROTEIN_ whereas the peroxisomal marker proteins are not affected . images in figure m to o display the peroxisomal marker fusions in the corresponding merged images with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in figure j to l. _LOCATION_ containing the _METHOD_ peroxisomal marker fusions are similar in size and display similar motility to cells not _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ .
