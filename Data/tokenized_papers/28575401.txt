when _PROTEIN_ is mutated asymmetric localization of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ particularly to the apical side of cells fails to occur properly in developing veins resulting in an open vein pattern . _PROTEIN_ encodes a protein with a pleckstrin homology like domain suggesting interaction with phosphoinositides . _PROTEIN_ has been previously found to interact with an adp ribosylation _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ activating protein important for vein patterning _PROTEIN_ . we find that _PROTEIN_ green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ localizes to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and to punctae labeled by _PROTEIN_ yellow _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ . supporting the idea that the _PROTEIN_ pl domain recognizes phosphatidylinositol phosphate _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ co localizes with ptdins p markers and is more _LOCATION_ when in a background mutant for the ptdins hydrolases _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ partially co localize with markers for the trans _LOCATION_ network at which endocytic and secretory pathways merge . _PROTEIN_ labeled punctae rarely co localize with the endocytic marker suggesting that _PROTEIN_ is not involved primarily in the endocytic pathway . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ co localize with members of the _PROTEIN_ group of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ which are proposed to act in the post _LOCATION_ secretory pathway . the compartments labeled by _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ do not localize to _LOCATION_ compartments induced by the fungal toxin brefeldin a . collectively our data suggest that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ act in a bfa insensitive secretory pathway .
_PROTEIN_ is essential for the auxin response that directs vascular differentiation in developing cotyledons and leaves and is important in localizing _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ within developing leaf vein cells . introduction of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ into _PROTEIN_ mutants results in a wild type leaf vein phenotype suggesting that transcription driven by the promoter provides adequate spatial and temporal _PROTEIN_ and the fusion protein is functional . in dag cotyledons punctae of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ are visible in developing vascular cells but _PROTEIN_ is too weak to provide sufficient samples for reliable comparison . thus cotyledon epidermal cells were used for further analysis . we noticed that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ localization in cotyledon epidermal cells is different in cotyledons at different ages . at dag when pavement cells are more or less circular in shape _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ is _LOCATION_ in most cells but is associated with the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and/or in punctae in of cells . at dag when cells are expanding and initiating lobes and indentations more cells have _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ associated with punctae or with punctae and the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . lobe initiation is complete by dag and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ localization is again more _LOCATION_ at both dag and dag . because dag pavement cells have the highest association of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ with punctae and the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ all subsequent analyses were done at this stage . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ form a complex which has been proposed through their respective ph or pl domains to bind to ptdins p a product generated by inositol polyphosphate phosphatases such as _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . when both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are mutated _PROTEIN_ is mislocalized from the tgn to the _LOCATION_ . to investigate whether _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ localization is similarly altered in _PROTEIN_ mutants _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was introduced into the _PROTEIN_ mutant background . _PROTEIN_ mutants develop more slowly than the wild type . to determine if cotyledon epidermal cells of dag _PROTEIN_ mutants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were at a similar stage to those in the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ line we measured area and perimeter then calculated the ui according to the formula ui p/ . we found no significant differences in these characters suggesting that epidermal pavement cells in the two genotypes are at a similar stage of development at dag . observation of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in cotyledons of both genotypes at dag indicates that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ localization is significantly more _LOCATION_ in _PROTEIN_ mutants than in _PROTEIN_ mutants . the phospholipid signaling pathway of arabidopsis includes three families of phosphoinositide kinases of which _PROTEIN_ can yield _PROTEIN_ . in arabidopsis two _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ genes have been identified . we asked whether _PROTEIN_ localization and _PROTEIN_ is altered in plants mutant for both genes . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was introduced into _PROTEIN_ mutants and dag cotyledons were analyzed for _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ localization . no difference was observed in _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ localization in _PROTEIN_ mutants compared with the original _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ line . to assess which phosphoinositides _PROTEIN_ associates with in vivo we created lines _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and markers for different phosphoinositides _PROTEIN_ ptdins p _PROTEIN_ ptdins p _PROTEIN_ or ptdins _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ are not all _PROTEIN_ in cotyledon pavement epidermal cells thus we focused on co localization within the root protoderm . in root protoderm cells as in cotyledon pavement cells _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ is localized to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and to punctae in some cells and to the _LOCATION_ in other cells . while localization to the punctae was visible when _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was excited with the nm laser only _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ localization was visible when _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was excited with the nm laser with a reduced emission spectrum as when co localization with _METHOD_ was carried out . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ did not co localize with the ptdins p marker _PROTEIN_ citrine but co localized very strongly with the ptdins p marker _PROTEIN_ citrine and co localized moderately with the ptdins marker _PROTEIN_ citrine . the co localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ with ptdins p and ptdins both of which localize to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ indicates that in root protodermal cells _PROTEIN_ is strongly associated with the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . to establish that _PROTEIN_ is localized at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and to understand the nature of the punctae we determined the co localization of _PROTEIN_ with a set of markers specific for the plant endomembrane system in both stable and transient _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . in cotyledon epidermal cells _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ associated moderately with both _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ markers _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . following plasmolysis of arabidopsis seedlings _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signal remains similarly associated with the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ label providing further evidence that _PROTEIN_ is associated with the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . interestingly whereas a proportion of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ is like _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ uniformly distributed throughout the _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ is also localized to bright _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ associated foci . we next set out to better define the nature of the punctae to which _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ localizes . in n. tabacum epidermal cells as in arabidopsis cotyledon epidermal cells _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ is frequently _LOCATION_ but does show clear localization to punctae in a proportion of cells . we focused our analysis on those cells in which _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was localized to punctae . in these cells _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ does not co localize with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ a marker of the _LOCATION_ apparatus . partial localization to the tgn/early endosome was indicated by _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ moderately co localizing with markers _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in n. tabacum epidermal cells and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis pavement cells . taken together our results suggest that _PROTEIN_ is localized to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ as well as to a subset of the tgn . previous experiments using transient _PROTEIN_ in a heterologous system showed that vab _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ co localized to dot like structures . to confirm that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ co localize in arabidopsis and to understand further the localization of _PROTEIN_ we introduced _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ into the mutant an allele of _PROTEIN_ . reversion of the leaf vein phenotype to wild type indicated that the fusion protein was functional and the promoter sufficient for transcription . we next created stable transgenic lines _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and analyzed their localization patterns . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ co localizes strongly with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in cotyledon epidermal cells and in root cells . in cotyledon cells _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ labeled punctae are almost always also labeled by _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ whereas a subset of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ labeled punctae are consistently not labeled by _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . interestingly we noticed that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ localizes more consistently to punctae in the presence of _PROTEIN_ than in its absence . whereas only of dag cotyledon cells _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ alone had _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ localized to punctae all of dag cotyledon cells co _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ have _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ localized to punctae . like _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ shows moderate co localization with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and does not associate with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . while the arf substrate of _PROTEIN_ is unknown likely candidates are the proteins which have been proposed as the potential substrates of _PROTEIN_ based on sequence similarity to their mammalian counterparts . six highly similar proteins exist in arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ . cellular localization of only has been established and it has been found to localize to the _LOCATION_ apparatus and tgn . we performed transient _PROTEIN_ in n. tabaccum of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ with four members of the arf gene family _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ fused to _METHOD_ . consistent with their localization to the tgn _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ shows strong co localization with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . supporting functional redundancy among the family _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ co localized to a similar extent with all of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . the endocytic and secretory pathways merge within the tgn thus we sought to understand with which pathway _PROTEIN_ is associated . first we determined that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ co localized strongly with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ which is considered a marker of the early and recycling endosomes . in contrast we found that _PROTEIN_ co localizes weakly with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ a marker of the _PROTEIN_ endosome/pre _LOCATION_ complex . to confirm the localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ within the ee we treated _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ seedlings with the _METHOD_ endocytic tracer . labels the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and is taken into the cell interior by endocytosis after which it gradually labels the entire endocytic pathway . seedlings were treated with for min rinsed and vesicles co localizing with were observed after and min . co localized with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ as indicated by a pcc of at all time points . surprisingly when only punctae were considered co localized with very few _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ punctae at all time points . the small proportion of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ punctae localizing with suggests that _PROTEIN_ is not acting predominantly in the endocytic pathway . while our data indicate very strong co localization of _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ has been suggested to have a role in clathrin mediated endocytosis . to explore this paradox we assessed co localization of with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . association of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ punctae with label was slightly higher than that of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ at the min time point and increased to at min and at min . while the co localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ with supports the idea that a proportion of _PROTEIN_ may be acting in endocytosis the low level of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ association with suggests that the proteins do not act primarily in the endocytic pathway . we asked if _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ might be acting in the secretory pathway by assessing their co localization with several _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ group . in tobacco epidermal cells _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ co localized strongly with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ which is involved in secretion in both root hairs and pollen tubes . we attempted to assess co localization of both _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in n. tabacum however in our hands _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was almost entirely _LOCATION_ in this system . we next _PROTEIN_ the fusion proteins in n. benthamiana as had been previously reported and saw frequent localization of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ to the punctae . in this system _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was entirely _LOCATION_ but _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was localized to discrete punctae that frequently co localized with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . we also assessed co localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in cotyledon pavement cells of stably transformed arabidopsis and found a very similar strong co localization . the strong association of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ acting in the secretory pathway combined with their weak association with the endocytic marker suggests that a significant proportion of the proteins act in the secretory pathway . as described above _PROTEIN_ associates with _PROTEIN_ an arf gap and also with members of the _PROTEIN_ family raising the possibility that _PROTEIN_ might associate with an arf gef . since arf gefs can be categorized based on their sensitivity to the fungal toxin bfa we sought to eliminate possible arf gef associations by assessing the bfa sensitivity of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . comparison of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ localization in bfa untreated and bfa treated roots revealed no differences indicating that _PROTEIN_ compartments are insensitive to bfa treatment in root tissues . to compare the behavior of _PROTEIN_ compartments with bfa induced compartments we exposed seedlings _PROTEIN_ both _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ to bfa . following exposure the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ marker localized to bfa compartments in root epidermal cells whereas _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ remained localized to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and not bfa compartments . we next asked whether _PROTEIN_ was similarly insensitive to bfa by treating seedlings _PROTEIN_ both _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ with bfa . again whereas _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ localized to bfa compartments _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ remained localized to small discrete punctae in root cells . interestingly _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ almost entirely localized to bfa compartments while a proportion of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ did not become incorporated into the bfa compartments . we observed a similar proportion of vesicles labeled by both _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in bfa untreated and bfa treated root cells implying that the bfa insensitive compartment is not homogenous . to determine further whether the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ complex is sensitive to bfa seedlings _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were treated with bfa and compared with untreated seedlings . no difference was observed either in the morphology of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ vesicles or in their co localization patterns . the insensitivity of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ compartments to bfa suggests that if they are associated with an arf gef it is likely to be a bfa resistant member .

injected with agrobacterium strains harboring appropriate binary vectors following a previous protocol . in order to analyze the localization of _PROTEIN_ in mutants defective in phosphoinositide production a line homozygous for _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was crossed to _PROTEIN_ and and the was backcrossed to the double mutant . homozygous plants for _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ with _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_
