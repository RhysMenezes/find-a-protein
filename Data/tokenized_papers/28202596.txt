we report the characterization of the arabidopsis hydroxyacyl acyl carrier protein dehydratase component of the mitochondrial fatty acid synthase system encoded by _PROTEIN_ . the mitochondrial localization and catalytic capability of mthd were demonstrated with a green _METHOD_ protein transgenesis experiment and by in vivo complementation and in vitro enzymatic assays . rna interference knockdown lines with reduced mthd _PROTEIN_ exhibit traits typically associated with mtfas mutants namely a miniaturized morphological appearance reduced lipoylation of lipoylated proteins and altered metabolomes consistent with the reduced catalytic activity of lipoylated enzymes . these alterations are reversed when mthd rnai mutant plants are grown in a _PROTEIN_ atmosphere indicating the link between mtfas and photorespiratory deficiency due to the reduced lipoylation of glycine decarboxylase . in vivo biochemical feeding experiments illustrate that sucrose and glycolate are the metabolic modulators that mediate the alterations in morphology and lipid accumulation . in addition both mthd rnai and mtkas mutants exhibit reduced accumulation of hydroxytetradecanoic acid and abnormal chloroplastic starch granules these changes are not reversible by the _PROTEIN_ atmosphere demonstrating two novel mtfas functions that are independent of photorespiration . finally rna sequencing analysis revealed that mthd rnai and mtkas mutants are nearly equivalent to each other in altering the transcriptome and these analyses further identified genes whose _PROTEIN_ is affected by a functional mtfas system but independent of photorespiratory deficiency . these data demonstrate the nonredundant nature of the mtfas system which contributes unique lipid components needed to support plant cell structure and metabolism .
sequence based identification of a candidate plant mthd gene is somewhat complex because the two well characterized mthd homologs from yeast and humans share heterogenous and low sequence similarity with many genes from plantae . for example blast analysis with the yeast sequence failed to identify any significant arabidopsis homolog whereas parallel analysis with the human identified a single mthd candidate _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ protein coding sequence was cloned with a reverse transcription pcr strategy using an rna template isolated from aerial organs of young arabidopsis seedlings . this cds encodes a protein of amino acids that contains an n terminal residue segment that is not homologous with human hshtd . this n terminal sequence is rich in basic amino acids and lacks acidic residues these being characteristics typical of mitochondrial targeting presequence elements . the _PROTEIN_ encoded protein is predicted to be mitochondrially localized by mitoprot ii psort and target p . the _PROTEIN_ cds was _PROTEIN_ in the yeast mutant strain that lacks a functional mthd enzyme . this strain can not grow on glycerol as the sole _PROTEIN_ source due to a respiratory deficiency . in this experiment the putative mitochondrial targeting presequence of the _PROTEIN_ protein was replaced by the mitochondrial presequence of the yeast _PROTEIN_ protein to ensure the correct mitochondrial localization of the _PROTEIN_ protein in yeast . as illustrated in figure neither the empty plasmid control nor the _PROTEIN_ mitochondrial targeting element are capable of rescuing the growth deficiency of the mutant strain on glycerol but both the native yeast gene and the _PROTEIN_ cds restored the growth of the yeast strain on glycerol medium . therefore this experiment establishes that the _PROTEIN_ gene codes for a function that overcomes the deficiency in hydroxyacyl _PROTEIN_ dehydratase activity that is capable of generating acyl _PROTEIN_ that is used to synthesize lipoic acid in yeast . the escherichia coli produced recombinant _PROTEIN_ coding protein was assayed for the ability to catalyze hydroxyacyl _PROTEIN_ dehydratase activity . as with hyroxyacyl _PROTEIN_ dehydratases characterized from a variety of different type ii fas _METHOD_ this reaction was assayed in the reverse direction namely the hydration of enoyl coa substrates . in addition this assay was used to determine the substrate specificity of the enzyme in relation to the acyl chain length of the substrate and these data were compared with the specificity of the mtkas enzyme . two enoyl coa thioesters were chemically synthesized as substrates for these assays and eight different acyl _PROTEIN_ thioesters were synthesized as substrates for the mtkas assays . both enzymes exhibited classical hyperbolic michaelis menten activity responses to increasing concentrations of each tested substrate and km and vmax values were calculated for each substrate enzyme combination . the _PROTEIN_ coding protein has the ability to catalyze the expected hydration of the enoyl coa thioesters and the catalytic efficiency for the medium chain substrate is similar to that of the long chain substrate . similarly mtkas is able to use saturated acyl _PROTEIN_ thioesters of between and _PROTEIN_ acyl chains as substrates but its activity with the unsaturated substrate _PROTEIN_ was barely detectable . the catalytic efficiency of mtkas with different saturated acyl _PROTEIN_ substrates is ranked in the following order > > > > > > . this ranking is affected by differences in both km and vmax with each substrate . these characterizations indicate that plant mtfas enzymes have the ability to synthesize saturated fatty acids of up to _PROTEIN_ chain length . the subcellular localization of the _PROTEIN_ protein was experimentally determined in arabidopsis with a _METHOD_ tagged transgenic fusion protein . in this experiment the dna fragment encoding the n terminal residues of the _PROTEIN_ protein was tested for its ability to target _METHOD_ to a specific organelle . figure shows confocal micrographs of roots and leaf mesophyll cells of the resulting _METHOD_ transgenic plants . in roots mitotracker orange was applied as the mitochondrial marker and it was recorded simultaneously with _METHOD_ _METHOD_ while in mesophyll cells chlorophyll _METHOD_ was used as a chloroplastic marker . in plants carrying the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgene _METHOD_ signals were obtained from both roots and leaf mesophyll cells in a distinct pattern that indicates localization in organelles . this _METHOD_ feature overlaps with the mitotracker orange in roots but is distinct from the leaf chlorophyll _METHOD_ revealing that the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein is mitochondrially localized . in control experiments no _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was detectable in roots and mesophyll cells of the wild type plants in transgenic plants carrying a nontargeted _METHOD_ construct _METHOD_ the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ localizes to the _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ which is consistent with previous reports . in combination therefore these sets of experiments presented in figures to lead us to the conclusions that _PROTEIN_ encodes the mthd enzyme and that this organelle targeting process is guided by the n terminal residue leader sequence . furthermore the enzyme kinetic data reveal that in arabidopsis mthd and mtkas do not restrain the mtfas system from synthesizing long chain saturated fatty acids of up to _PROTEIN_ in length . this contrasts with other characterized eukaryotic mtfas _METHOD_ where the substrate specificity of either mthd or mtkas constrains the system to produce fatty acids of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and shorter . the spatial and temporal _PROTEIN_ pattern of the mthd gene was determined by quantitative rt pcr and these data were compared directly with those for the other well characterized mtfas gene mtkas _PROTEIN_ . quantitative rt pcr analysis of rna preparations extracted from different organs shows that the two mtfas genes exhibit parallel _PROTEIN_ patterns . the _PROTEIN_ of both mthd and mtkas genes occurs in all organs tested with an approximately fold difference between the highest and lowest levels of _PROTEIN_ . these nearly ubiquitous _PROTEIN_ patterns of the mthd and mtkas genes are consistent with the microarray data visualized by the arabidopsis _METHOD_ browser and also are comparable with the _PROTEIN_ patterns of other already characterized mtfas components such as the mtppt and mtmcs genes . the physiological significance of the mthd gene was investigated by studying segregants identified among a family of plants generated from an arabidopsis genetic stock that carries a t dna tagged mutant allele in the heterozygous state . these characterizations demonstrated that the t dna tagged mutant is not a null allele and that there was no obvious phenotypic difference between wild type plants and those that were homozygous for the mthd allele . as an alternative therefore we generated rna interference transgenic plants which _PROTEIN_ a suppressor of the mthd gene under the control of the promoter . seventy eight independent rnai lines were recovered and quantitative rt pcr analysis determined the levels of the remaining mthd transcript in the aerial organs of young seedlings at dai . two rnai lines that exhibit the lowest mthd _PROTEIN_ levels were designated as mthd rnai and mthd rnai strains respectively and these were used in subsequent analyses . these two mutant strains exhibit aerial organs that are significantly reduced in size compared with the wild type plants and their developmental appearance was classified according to the systematic system developed by citation . thus at dai these mutant plants develop to stage whereas the wild type plants develop to stage within the same time period . when these mthd rnai mutant plants were grown in an atmosphere containing _PROTEIN_ they grew nearly normally . the phenotypic reversal in the elevated _PROTEIN_ atmosphere is typical of photorespiratory deficiency with the elevated _PROTEIN_ levels inhibiting the oxygenation reaction of rubisco and thus reducing the levels of phosphoglycolate the starter metabolite of photorespiration . furthermore this phenotype also is conferred by mutations in other mtfas components such as mtkas mtppt rnai and _PROTEIN_ . to test any additive effect of mutations in the mthd and mtkas catalyzed reactions we generated double mutant stocks by transforming the mtkas mutant line with the mthd rnai transgene . we recovered independent transformants and selected two lines that display the lowest mthd _PROTEIN_ levels for additional analysis . in ambient air the double mutant lines exhibit a stronger growth defect compared with the mtkas parental plants . in our experimental conditions at dai the growth of these double mutants is arrested at stage whereas the mtkas mutant plants develop to stage . in addition these double mutant plants do not progress any further in development and eventually die which contrasts with the situation with the mtkas mutant which progresses to maturity although at a slower rate than the wild type plants and ultimately sets seeds . when grown in the _PROTEIN_ atmosphere the growth of these double mutants is reversed to a nearly wild type appearance and these plants develop to stage by dai . more detailed insights into the growth phenotype of mthd rnai and mtkas mutants were obtained by examining leaves of these mutants by light microscopy and transmission electron microscopy . these observations illustrate the distinct differences in leaf cell morphology and ultrastructure between the wild type plants and the mutants . specifically when these plants are grown in ambient air mesophyll cells are enlarged in the mutants making the leaves _PROTEIN_ than those of wild type plants . despite the _PROTEIN_ that these mutants lack a mitochondrial biochemical function the ultrastructure of this organelle is unaffected . the most dramatic ultrastructural alterations in the mutants are associated with chloroplasts . _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ assembly is affected by the mutations with the _LOCATION_ structures being sparser and less extensive . furthermore the starch granule ultrastructure appears to be drastically altered in the mutant lines with many small granules present this compares with the typical two to five disc shaped structures that occur in the wild type plants . most of these alterations in the leaf cell morphology and ultrastructure of the mutants _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ are reversed when the mutant plants are grown in the _PROTEIN_ atmosphere . the exception to this morphological reversal is the ultrastructure of the starch granules which _PROTEIN_ the abnormal morphology observed when the plants were grown in ambient air . mitochondrial lipoic acid biosynthesis is primed with octanoyl _PROTEIN_ generated by the mtfas system . therefore we examined the protein lipoylation status of different enzymes in the mtfas mutants . using a western blot procedure with anti lipoic acid antibodies we examined the lipoylation status of the h subunit of gdc subunits of mitochondrial pdh and kgdh and _LOCATION_ pdh . plants were grown in the _PROTEIN_ atmosphere to eliminate any bias due to the morphological appearance associated with the mutant alleles . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ analysis of protein extracts does not indicate any dramatic differences in the _PROTEIN_ proteomes of these mutant plants . the most dramatic alteration in the lipoylation status of these proteins was associated with the h subunit of gdc which is depleted to about of wild type levels in the mthd rnai mutants and is undetectable in the mtkas mutant and mtkas mthd rnai double mutant strains . the dramatic depletion in the lipoylation status of this protein does not affect the accumulation of the h protein itself as indicated by measurements made using anti h protein antibodies . therefore these plants harbor a large pool of inactive apo h subunit of gdc . these immuno based lipoic acid analyses also identified that the lipoylation status of other mitochondrial lipoylated proteins also is reduced in these mutant plants these are _PROTEIN_ to as low as of the wild type level . in all of these mutants the lipoylation status of the subunit of _LOCATION_ pdh was unaffected . using multiple analytical _METHOD_ the metabolomes of the mthd rnai and mtkas mutants were analyzed and compared with those of wild type plants . these analyses quantified metabolites in aerial organs and these metabolites were categorized as aqueous metabolites fatty acids lipids surface cuticular lipids and starch granule components . the metabolomes of these mutants and wild type plants were determined when they were grown in either ambient air when the growth phenotype associated with the photorespiratory deficiency is _PROTEIN_ or in the _PROTEIN_ atmosphere when the photorespiratory growth phenotype is suppressed . in ambient air the most dramatic metabolic alteration in aqueous metabolites is a to fold hyperaccumulation of gly . several additional aqueous metabolites exhibit significant but smaller increases in accumulation between and fold of the wild type levels . in contrast suc is depleted to between and of the level present in the wild type plants . all of these mutant plants exhibit significantly reduced levels of saponifiable fatty acids that constitute _LOCATION_ lipids . consistent with the reduction in the accumulation of these fatty acids the levels of the major leaf glycoglycerolipids are reduced markedly to below of the wild type levels . chlorophyll content also is reduced to below of the wild type level as would be expected from the yellowish appearance of the mutant plants . in addition the accumulation of most surface cuticular lipids is reduced significantly in these mutants . in contrast however tag hyperaccumulates to above fold of the wild type level . alterations in the accumulation of phospholipids and diacylglycerol are barely detectable . in addition the quantities of insoluble starch and water soluble glc polysaccharide were compared between the wild type and mutant plants . despite the difference in starch granule morphology observed by transmission electron microscopy the total quantity of starch and wsp was essentially unchanged in the mutants . these alterations in the metabolome appear to be a consequence of the deficiency in photorespiration because most of these are reversed when the mutant plants are grown in a condition that inhibits photorespiration _PROTEIN_ . an exception is gly which although it is reduced significantly when these mutant plants are grown in the _PROTEIN_ atmosphere is still to fold higher than that in the wild type plants . we also compared the aqueous metabolite profiles between the mtkas mthd rnai double mutant and its parental mtkas mutant plants . whereas malonate levels are unaffected in the mtkas and mthd rnai single mutants it is elevated by fold in the double mutant even when these plants are grown in the _PROTEIN_ atmosphere which suppresses photorespiration . this elevation in malonate levels and the associated growth penalty resembles the situation in the _PROTEIN_ mutant which can not activate malonate to malonyl coa . therefore the reduced size of the mtkas mthd rnai double mutants may be associated with malonate toxicity a known inhibitor of succinate dehydrogenase activity . based on the observation that growing the mthd rnai and mtkas mutant plants in an elevated _PROTEIN_ atmosphere suppresses the changes in morphology and metabolome we considered that some of these genetic deficiency effects are secondary to the deficiency in photorespiration . we hypothesized for example that the alterations in morphology and lipids are a result of the alterations in the steady state levels of soluble metabolites that are intermediates of photorespiration . this postulate was tested by exogenously feeding these photorespiration intermediates to wild type and mtkas mutant plants and testing whether these biochemicals complement or mimic the mtkas mutation . specifically we targeted the effects of treating plants with suc glycolate and gly the metabolites associated with photorespiration whose accumulation is either down or up regulated by the mutations . by growing wild type and mtkas mutant plants on medium supplemented with suc we tested whether the mtkas induced reduction in suc accumulation was the cause of the alterations in morphology and lipids . first as indicated by directly assaying the suc content of the tissue we showed that these plants take up the exogenously supplied suc and the suc depletion that occurs in the mtkas mutant plants is alleviated significantly reaching about of the level obtained in the suc treated wild type plants . the suc supplementation markedly relieves the dwarf phenotype and the yellowish leaf color of the mtkas mutant plants . in addition externally added suc reverses the mtkas induced alteration in the ultrastructure of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ system . moreover the suc treatment effectively complements the alterations in the profiles of fatty acids glycoglycerolipids and chlorophylls . in contrast exogenous suc does not reverse the enlarged mesophyll cells abnormal starch grains and hyperaccumulation of tag in the mtkas mutant . these results demonstrate that suc depletion in the mtkas mutant contributes to the morphological phenotype _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and the alterations in glycoglycerolipids . in corollary experiments we evaluated the effects of other exogenous biochemicals on the wild type plants to test whether the mtkas induced hyperaccumulation of these photorespiratory intermediates is the cause of the morphological phenotype and of the altered lipidome in the mutants . these exogenously provided biochemicals appear to have been taken up by the plants as evidenced by the fold increase in glycolate tissue levels in the glycolate treated plants these elevated levels are similar to those measured in the mthd rnai and mtkas mutant plants . the application of exogenous glycolate leads to a dramatic dwarf appearance with dark green leaf color . in addition this treatment increases the number of large starch granules in the chloroplasts . in parallel these plants also exhibit about a fold increase in tag accumulation . these metabolic changes resemble those observed in the mthd rnai and mtkas mutant plants which also hyperaccumulate glycolate . in contrast glycolate does not affect the accumulation of other portions of the tested plant lipidome in a pattern that resembles the mthd rnai and mtkas mutants . the contribution of gly to the alterations in morphology and lipidome is somewhat more difficult to determine as the exogenous application of gly to the wild type plants only leads to an increase of the endogenous gly levels by about fold which is considerably lower than the over fold hyperaccumulation that occurs in the mthd rnai and mtkas mutants . moreover when the mtkas mutant phenotype is suppressed by growth in the _PROTEIN_ atmosphere endogenous gly levels are still fold higher than those that occur in the wild type plants . it appears therefore that gly hyperaccumulation is only a small contributor to those alterations in morphology and lipidome . in addition to the metabolic alterations discussed above we also identified two novel fatty acids in arabidopsis hydroxytetradecanoic acid and hydroxyhexadecanoic acid . these are components that have long been known to be associated with gram negative bacterial lipid a and recently were described with arabidopsis lipid a like molecules . while the accumulation of hydroxyhexadecanoic acid is unaffected in the mthd rnai and mtkas mutant plants the accumulation of hydroxytetradecanoic acid is depleted to between and of the wild type level irrespective of the atmospheric conditions that affect photorespiration . to clarify the metabolic origin of hydroxytetradecanoic acid we assayed its accumulation in two mutant strains that are deficient either in photorespiration _PROTEIN_ or in the biosynthesis of lipid a like molecules _PROTEIN_ . hydroxyhexadecanoic acid content is unaffected in the _PROTEIN_ mutant demonstrating that its depletion is independent of the photorespiratory deficiency . in the _PROTEIN_ mutant however the accumulation of hydroxytetradecanoic acid is depleted to of the wild type level indicating that lipid a like molecules are the major metabolic sink of this hydroxylated fatty acid . the latter conclusion is further supported by the substrate specificity of acyl transferases _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ that are involved in the assembly of lipid a like molecules all of these enzymes recognize hydroxytetradecanoyl _PROTEIN_ as their optimal substrate . rna sequencing experiments were performed to assess alterations in the transcriptomes associated with two independent genetic blocks in the mtfas system namely mthd rnai and mtkas mutant strains . in these experiments we sequenced the transcriptomes of the wild type and the two mutant strains that were grown in either ambient air or the _PROTEIN_ atmosphere . initially we directly measured changes in gene _PROTEIN_ by conducting quantitative rt pcr on nine target genes and tested the validity of using the count numbers obtained from the identical rna sample preparations by rna seq analysis . correlation coefficients of the data obtained by the two methods are above indicating that rna seq read counts can be used as a quantitative readout of global changes in gene _PROTEIN_ in response to the two mutations . statistical analyses investigated whether mthd rnai and mtkas elicit similar changes in the transcriptome . these analyses identified differentially _PROTEIN_ genes among the three genotypes when these plants were grown in the two environmental conditions _PROTEIN_ these are comparisons to of figure . gene ontology functional categories associated with these degs were analyzed at tair . comparisons _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ indicate that each mutation significantly alters the _PROTEIN_ of a large proportion of the genome when plants are grown in ambient air . a test for the association between the two deg lists indicates a significant overlap between genes affected by the mthd rnai and mtkas mutations . furthermore figure shows the plot of fold change in _PROTEIN_ in comparison versus comparison and indicates that the directions and magnitudes of the estimated effects of each mutation were strongly positively correlated . however comparison demonstrates that there are a few genes _PROTEIN_ whose _PROTEIN_ is differentially affected between the two mutants . while the distinctions in gene _PROTEIN_ profiles between the wild type and mutants were greatly reduced when these plants were grown in the _PROTEIN_ atmosphere similar relationships between these three genotypes are apparent . specifically comparisons _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ show strong correlated changes in the transcriptome relative to the differences between the two mutants as reflected by comparison _PROTEIN_ . again a test for association between the deg lists for comparisons and indicates a significant overlap between the genes affected by the two mutations and figure shows a positive correlation between the effects of each mutation . collectively these results demonstrate that the mthd rnai and mtkas mutations induce parallel changes in the transcriptome which supports the hypothesis that these two genes operate in the same metabolic pathway namely mtfas . further statistical analyses addressed whether any photorespiration independent but mtfas dependent processes are revealed by rna seq analysis of the mthd rnai and mtkas mutants . for these analyses we initially identified degs whose _PROTEIN_ is associated with three modifiers of gene _PROTEIN_ different genotypes different environmental conditions _PROTEIN_ and the interaction between genotypes and environmental conditions . these analyses identified degs _PROTEIN_ whose _PROTEIN_ is associated with one or more of these three modifiers . approximately half of these degs are singularly affected by the g e or gxe effect . multiple modifiers combine to affect the _PROTEIN_ of the remaining degs these being combinations of three subsets that combine two modifiers and one subset that combine all three modifies . additional insights on the metabolic impact of these modifiers were obtained by dissecting each of the seven subsets illustrated by the venn diagram shown in figure into clusters that visualize the _PROTEIN_ pattern relative to the three genotypes and two different environmental conditions . for example the degs that respond only to the g effect can be separated into two clusters cluster contains degs that are up regulated in each mutant and cluster contains degs that are down regulated in each mutant but all of these genes are minimally affected by the change in environmental conditions . therefore these are genes whose _PROTEIN_ is affected by the mtfas deficiency irrespective of the atmospheric _PROTEIN_ concentration . therefore these degs probably are not associated with the photorespiratory deficiency as the latter would be expected to show distinct gene _PROTEIN_ patterns between plants grown in ambient air and the _PROTEIN_ atmosphere . similarly degs that respond only to the e effect can be separated into two clusters cluster contains degs whose _PROTEIN_ is higher in the _PROTEIN_ atmosphere whereas cluster contains degs whose _PROTEIN_ is lower in the _PROTEIN_ atmosphere but all of these genes are minimally affected by differences in genotypes . therefore these degs are responding _PROTEIN_ to the change in the atmospheric _PROTEIN_ concentration and not to the mtfas deficiency . degs that respond to only the gxe effect also can be separated into two clusters . but these degs demonstrate interdependence between the g and e effects in altering gene _PROTEIN_ . specifically cluster contains degs whose _PROTEIN_ is up regulated in each of the mutants when grown in ambient air but down regulated when grown in the _PROTEIN_ atmosphere . degs in cluster are oppositely affected in that the _PROTEIN_ of these genes is down regulated in the mutants in ambient air but up regulated in the mutants in the _PROTEIN_ atmosphere . the subsets that integrate two or more modifiers of gene _PROTEIN_ are clustered in multiple _PROTEIN_ patterns and these appear to be additive of the patterns of each individual modifier . for example genes whose _PROTEIN_ is affected by both the g effect and the e effect can be separated into six clusters . similarly clusters to are identifiable by examining the patterns of gene _PROTEIN_ that respond to two or all three modifiers . the _PROTEIN_ of these latter degs shows complex patterns that are associated with both the mtfas deficiency and variations in the atmospheric _PROTEIN_ concentration . an example is cluster which contains degs whose response to genotypes is restricted to only the ambient air condition . because the altered _PROTEIN_ of degs in this cluster is suppressed when plants are grown in the _PROTEIN_ atmosphere we associate these genes as responding to the mtfas dependent photorespiratory deficiency . by generally applying this rationale we were able to identify clusters as containing degs that are associated primarily with the mtfas deficiency and distinguish them from those that are associated with the change in the atmospheric _PROTEIN_ concentration with the photorespiratory deficiency or combinations thereof . the biological functionalities of degs associated with the mtfas dependent processes but independent of photorespiratory deficiency were explored by go enrichment analyses using amigo . these analyses focused on gene annotations associated with degs in _PROTEIN_ clusters and to . supplemental figure visualizes the results in the form of heat maps that categorize the deg annotations with go biological processes go subcellular components and go molecular functions . these analyses indicate that these eight _PROTEIN_ clusters separate into three distinct clades namely the clade that contains cluster the clade that contains cluster and the clade that contains clusters and . despite the _PROTEIN_ that the three clades contain degs whose _PROTEIN_ patterns are distinct the go annotation _METHOD_ that are enriched with each clade are quite similar . this similarity is visualized in tag clouds that identify words enriched in the go annotation _METHOD_ . thus all three clades have go annotation _METHOD_ that are rich in a few key words . from the biological process category these words are biosynthetic and metabolic processes from the subcellular compartment category these words are intracellular organelle complex and _LOCATION_ and from the molecular function category these words are binding activity enzyme classes such as hydrolase and ligase and metabolites such as purines nucleosides and nucleotides . the enrichment in these _METHOD_ appears to indicate that mtfas dependent processes that are independent of photorespiration may be associated with the metabolism of nucleotides and nucleosides and particularly with chloroplasts or _LOCATION_ . this latter term enrichment is consistent with the data presented in figure which demonstrated that the most dramatic ultrastructural alteration in these mtfas mutants is associated with alterations in the morphology of the chloroplasts and _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ assembly .

version . the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ genes were cloned into vector resulting in _PROTEIN_ pbe and _PROTEIN_ pbe . in the presence of _PROTEIN_ pbe or _PROTEIN_ pbe the lpxd gene of the e. coli strain was replaced by a genr cassette using a pcr based method with primers and . hybrid lipid a molecules were extracted from these strains and analyzed using a liquid chromatography tandem _METHOD_ _METHOD_ system _METHOD_ as described previously . the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae strain deficient in the gene was obtained from thermo scientific . the yeast and _PROTEIN_ mitochondrial presequence of the yeast wild type strain were cloned into vector _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ resulting in yep and respectively . arabidopsis mthd and mthd_tail were cloned into _PROTEIN_ resulting in mthd yep and mthd_tail yep respectively . the complementation test was performed as described previously . the arabidopsis genetic strains carrying the mthd mtkas mtkas and _PROTEIN_ alleles are in the columbia background and were obtained from the arabidopsis biological resource center . the _PROTEIN_ mutant was isolated from the arabidopsis functional genomics consortium t dna mutant population . primers for genotyping were as follows for mtkas and mtkas for _PROTEIN_ and for _PROTEIN_ . for the _METHOD_ experiments the mthd cds of bp was cloned into pentr/d topo vector and subcloned into _GENE_ using gateway lr clonase ii enzyme mix resulting in peg . for the rnai experiment the mthd cds of bp was cloned into pentr/d topo and subcloned into resulting in mthd . destination vectors were

previously . the _PROTEIN_ condition was controlled as the ambient level or the _PROTEIN_ level . plants were grown at with continuous illumination . confocal microscopy analysis was conducted on wild type control plants control transgenic plants carrying the _METHOD_ transgene and transgenic plants carrying the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgene . seedling plants at to dai were harvested for analysis as described previously . light microscopy and transmission electron microscopy analyses were performed with plants at dai using olympus bx and jeol respectively as mentioned previously . total protein was extracted from mg of fresh aerial organs of plants at dai as described previously . western blot analysis was performed on of total protein with anti lipoic acid antibodies or with anti h protein antibodies as described previously . metabolites were extracted from mg of fresh aerial organs of plants at dai and analyzed using multiple analytical _METHOD_ the waters xevo _PROTEIN_ q tof _METHOD_

and the agilent gc _METHOD_ system for fatty acids surface cuticular lipids and other soluble metabolites . _PROTEIN_ ratios and se were calculated as described previously . metabolomic data were deposited in the pmr database under accession number mtfas . rna seq was performed as described previously . specifically total rna was extracted from g of fresh aerial organs of plants at dai using _PROTEIN_ and was further purified using the rneasy plant mini kit following dnase i treatment to remove any dna contamination . the bp short insert library was constructed and sequenced using the illumina hiseq system and reagent . data files have been deposited in the ncbi sequence read archive under accession numbers _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . raw reads were cleaned by removing _PROTEIN_ and filtering reads with unknown nucleotides larger than or with low quality . the cleaned reads were aligned to the reference arabidopsis genome in phytozome version using tophat and the mapped reads were counted using htseq . the count data were analyzed as a completely randomized design with six treatments one for each combination of genotype and growth condition . each treatment was replicated three times . genes with an average of at least one uniquely mapped read across samples and a number of nonzero read counts at least as large as the number of treatments were tested for differential _PROTEIN_ among genotypes within each growth condition differential _PROTEIN_ between growth conditions within each genotype differential _PROTEIN_ among genotypes averaged over growth conditions _PROTEIN_ differential _PROTEIN_ between growth conditions averaged over genotypes _PROTEIN_ and interactions between genotypes and growth conditions using the r package quasiseq . the negative binomial qlshrink method implemented in the quasiseq package as described previously was used to compute a p value for each gene and each test described above . the log of each count mean was modeled as the sum of an intercept term a genotype effect a growth condition effect an interaction between genotype and growth condition and an offset normalization _PROTEIN_ determined for each sample by the log of the _PROTEIN_ normalization _PROTEIN_ . estimates of the fold change were computed by evaluating the exponential function at estimates of effect differences . using the p values for each comparison an approach described previously was used to estimate the number of genes with true null hypotheses among all genes tested and this estimate was used to convert the p values to q values . to obtain approximate control of the false discovery rate at genes with q values no larger than were declared to be differentially _PROTEIN_ . genes with at least one significant _PROTEIN_ effect or a significant interaction between genotypes and environmental conditions were divided into seven distinct sets and a cluster analysis was then performed separately on each set . these sets were defined by each possible combination of the three tests excluding genes without a significant _PROTEIN_ effect or interaction effect . for example one subset is composed of genes with a significant genotype effect but not a significant environmental condition effect nor a significant interaction effect . likewise another subset consists of genes with a significant environmental condition effect but not a significant genotype or interaction effect . the remaining five sets similarly each represent a unique combination of genotype environmental condition and interaction effects . a model based clustering algorithm implemented in the r package mbcluster.seq was applied to identify distinct gene _PROTEIN_ patterns among the genes in each set . the rna seq read counts were assumed to be drawn from a mixture of negative binomial distributions each of which represents a cluster . after accounting for normalization _PROTEIN_ and each gene s overall mean _PROTEIN_ level genes were assigned to clusters based on their _PROTEIN_ profiles or the collection of estimated fold changes across treatments and genotypes . the number of clusters in each set of genes was chosen using the akaike
