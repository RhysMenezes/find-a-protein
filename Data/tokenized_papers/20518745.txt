shmt catalyses reversible hydroxymethyl group transfer from serine to yielding glycine and methylenetetrahydrofolate . in _LOCATION_ shmts are thought to catalytically direct the hydroxymethyl moiety of serine into the metabolic network of bound one _PROTEIN_ units . genes encoding putative _LOCATION_ shmts were found in the genomes of various plant species . shmt activity was detected in chloroplasts in pea and barley suggesting that _LOCATION_ shmts exist in all flowering plants . the arabidopsis thaliana genome encodes one putative _LOCATION_ shmt _PROTEIN_ . its cdna was cloned by reverse transcription pcr and the encoded recombinant protein was produced in escherichia coli . evidence that _PROTEIN_ is targeted to _LOCATION_ was found by confocal microscopy of a. thaliana protoplasts transformed with proteins fused to enhanced green _METHOD_ protein . characterization of recombinant _PROTEIN_ revealed that substrate affinity for and the catalytic efficiency of increase with n and that inhibit _PROTEIN_ . methyltetrahydrofolate and formyltetrahydrofolate with one and five glutamate residues inhibited _PROTEIN_ catalysed hydroxymethyl group transfer from serine to with the pentaglutamylated inhibitors being more effective . calculations revealed inhibition with methyltetrahydrofolate or formyltetrahydrofolate resulting in little reduction in _PROTEIN_ activity under folate concentrations estimated for _LOCATION_ .
protein sequences of representative dicotyledons and monocotyledons as well as a moss and two green algae were retrieved from http //www.phytozome.net and http //www.brachypodium.org databases for use in the phylogenetic analysis . the complete genomes of the plant species used in this analysis have been published . overall the phylogenetic analysis showed that shmts from the same plant species but putatively targeted to different subcellular compartments are less similar to each other than they are to shmts from other plant species putatively targeted to the same organelle . the shmt protein sequences clustered into two _PROTEIN_ groups on the phylogenetic tree . the first group divided into two subgroups . subgroup ia comprised monocotyledon shmts with n terminal extensions predicted as _LOCATION_ targeting peptides as well as monocotyledon shmts and those of the remaining plant species with no n terminal extensions and so predicted to localize in the _LOCATION_ . the _METHOD_ protein sequence in subgroup carries a putative _LOCATION_ targeting peptide at the n terminus . the protein sequence in this subgroup is encoded by the and predicted genes . their dna sequences are identical except for the n terminal extension encoding a putative _LOCATION_ targeting peptide which is absent from the sequence but present in the sequence . the o. sativa est _PROTEIN_ database contains three ests _PROTEIN_ with the n terminus present in the sequence and no ests with the n terminus present in the sequence . thus we think that the and sequences represent the same gene that the sequence encodes the full length _LOCATION_ shmt and that during annotation the sequence was probably incorrectly spliced at the n terminus . it is also possible that alternative splicing can produce mrna and protein products encoded by the gene we found however no support for this possibility upon analysing est sequences . the protein sequence in subgroup is encoded by the predicted gene in the http //www.brachypodium.org database . the sequence lacks the n terminal extension predicted to encode the _LOCATION_ targeting peptide we found however that the b. distachyon genome encodes such an extension upstream of the sequence . thus we think that during annotation the sequence was probably incorrectly spliced at the n terminus . an alignment showing predicted protein sequences of putative _LOCATION_ shmts from selected monocotyledons is shown in supplementary figure . subgroup ib comprised shmts with n terminal extensions generally not recognized by prediction _METHOD_ as organellar targeting peptides . members of subgroup ib were also predicted to carry _LOCATION_ targeting signals at the c terminus we therefore assigned putative _LOCATION_ localization to the proteins in subgroup ib . proteins from dicotyledons monocotyledons and the moss were found in subgroups ia and ib . only one protein for each species of algae was found in group i from o. lucimarinus clustered with subgroup ia _PROTEIN_ from c. reinhardtii shared roughly equal sequence similarity with both subgroups . the sequence distribution within group i suggests that plants evolved separate shmts for the _LOCATION_ and the _LOCATION_ after the evolution of algae and before the evolution of mosses and that _LOCATION_ shmts in monocotyledons evolved within this clade from the _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ . the second group comprised shmts with n terminal extensions generally recognized by prediction _METHOD_ as organellar targeting peptides . this group divided into two subgroups with shmts predicted to localize either in _LOCATION_ or in mitochondria this suggests that organellar shmt _METHOD_ evolved before the speciation of vascular plants . we found no shmts from monocotyledons that clustered with putative _LOCATION_ shmts from the other plant species . the above described bioinformatic analysis predicting the existence of shmts in monocotyledon _LOCATION_ contradicted a previous work reporting no shmt activity in wheat chloroplasts . thus we examined shmt activity in _LOCATION_ of pea a representative dicotyledon and barley a representative monocotyledon with leaf extracts serving as positive assay controls . chloroplasts of both species were found to have nearly equal levels of shmt activity this contradicts previous biochemical evidence and supports the bioinformatic prediction for the occurrence of this activity in monocotyledon _LOCATION_ . purification of recombinant _PROTEIN_ is shown in figure . untagged recombinant enzymes were used in all subsequent work . _PROTEIN_ was assayed for activity in the presence of various concentrations and a constant serine concentration . kinetic parameters derived from non linear curve fitting to a model of uncompetitive substrate inhibition are presented in table . primary plots of steady state kinetic data used to calculate the kinetic parameters are shown in supplementary figure . these data showed that the km value _PROTEIN_ and the catalytic efficiency increases with n for and that those two values remain nearly unchanged for . increased polyglutamylation resulted in smaller relative _PROTEIN_ in the ki values than in the km values the ki/km value increases approx . fold for and fold for compared with that for . a previous study in pea found increased affinity for folylpolyglutamate substrates by a mitochondrial shmt for however the enzyme 's km values for > were not determined because of the lack of sensitivity of the radioassay used . thus a comparison of the kinetic properties of shmts from different subcellular compartments in plant cells awaits completion of their biochemical characterization . an shmt activity assay we developed recently may ease detailed biochemical characterization of other plant shmts because this assay is at least three orders of magnitude more sensitive than the standard radioassay under comparable experimental conditions . limited sensitivity of the standard radioassay is the most likely cause for the lack of published kinetic parameters for > for shmts from other _METHOD_ . the exception is a study reporting kinetic parameters for > for an shmt from pig liver the study reports a _PROTEIN_ in the km value for when n fold when n or and fold when n or . to increase understanding of how folylpolyglutamylation affects catalysis earlier studies in mammalian shmts addressed the issue by determining the dissociation constants for binding of to shmt . those studies found that the kd value for _PROTEIN_ when n for an shmt from rabbit liver mitochondria and _PROTEIN_ when n and remains constant when n for an shmt from the rabbit liver _LOCATION_ . in an shmt purified from pig liver the kd value _PROTEIN_ when n and remains constant when n . thus studies in two mammals suggest that increased polyglutamylation affects affinity for these substrates in an enzyme specific manner . future work will establish whether this holds true for plant enzymes . _PROTEIN_ activity was inhibited by and hco . this is consistent with previous studies showing that species inhibit shmts from rabbit and bind shmts from pig and e. coli and that hco species inhibit shmts from rabbit and pea mitochondria and bind shmts from human and zebrafish . furthermore the pentaglutamate folates were more effective inhibitors than the monoglutamate folates . this is consistent with previous studies showing that enzyme affinity for folylpolyglutamate inhibitors increases with the number of glutamate residues in mammalian shmts . subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ was examined by fusing the full length protein sequence to _METHOD_ . green _METHOD_ produced by _PROTEIN_ of this fusion protein in a. thaliana protoplasts appeared in the form of granules that overlapped with the red _METHOD_ of chloroplasts . the granular appearance of _METHOD_ fusion proteins in chloroplasts has been observed previously . the cause for such an appearance is currently unclear . green _METHOD_ was also visible throughout the cytoplasm in control protoplasts _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ alone . these findings thus establish that _PROTEIN_ has a functional n terminal peptide for its targeting to _LOCATION_ . consistently _PROTEIN_ has also been shown to localize in _LOCATION_ by a proteomic approach . organ and development specific _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ was studied in silico using publicly available microarray data and the genevestigator software package . _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ in all plant organs and at all developmental stages examined the _PROTEIN_ level in germinated seeds was around twice as high as those in all other organs . these findings suggest that _PROTEIN_ is a housekeeping enzyme needed by all plant organs throughout development .
