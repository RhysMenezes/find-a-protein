pentatricopeptide repeat _PROTEIN_ proteins _PROTEIN_ are encoded by a large gene family in arabidopsis and their functions are largely unknown . the few studied _PROTEIN_ are implicated in different developmental processes through their function in rna metabolism and posttranscriptional regulation in plant organelles . here we studied the functions of arabidopsis pentatricopeptide _PROTEIN_ protein for germination on nacl _PROTEIN_ in plant defense and abiotic stress responses . inactivation of _PROTEIN_ results in susceptibility to necrotrophic fungal pathogens as well as hypersensitivity to abscisic acid _PROTEIN_ and salinity . interestingly ectopic _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ results in the same phenotypes as the pgn null allele indicating that a tight regulation of the _PROTEIN_ transcript is required for normal function . loss of _PROTEIN_ function dramatically enhanced reactive oxygen species accumulation in seedlings in response to salt stress . inhibition of aba synthesis and signaling partially alleviates the _PROTEIN_ sensitivity of pgn suggesting that the mutant accumulates high endogenous aba . accordingly induction of _PROTEIN_ encoding the rate limiting enzyme in stress induced aba biosynthesis is significantly higher in pgn and the mutant has higher basal aba levels which may underlie its phenotypes . the pgn mutant has altered _PROTEIN_ of other aba related genes as well as mitochondria associated transcripts most notably elevated levels of _PROTEIN_ and alternative which are known for their roles in retrograde signaling induced by changes in or inhibition of mitochondrial function . these data coupled with its mitochondrial localization suggest that _PROTEIN_ functions in regulation of reactive oxygen species homeostasis in mitochondria during abiotic and biotic stress responses likely through involvement in retrograde signaling .
previously arabidopsis botrytis _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was found to play a contrasting role in plant defense positively contributing to resistance against b. cinerea but functioning as a negative regulator of resistance against virulent p. syringae . in an effort to further define the role of _PROTEIN_ in defense and identify genes involved in resistance we compared the genome wide transcript profiles of wild type and _PROTEIN_ plants prior to and following b. cinerea inoculation . from this _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ encoding a _PROTEIN_ was identified as a potential _PROTEIN_ target due to its increased basal _PROTEIN_ in the mutant and significant induction in wild type plants following infection . interestingly arabidopsis nahg lines have reduced b. cinerea induced _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . nahg plants are sa deficient whereas the _PROTEIN_ mutation leads to high basal and induced sa accumulation suggesting that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in response to b. cinerea is at least partially dependent on sa levels . yet exogenous application of sa does not affect _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ whereas treatment with methyl jasmonate leads to significant induction and the et precursor aminocyclopropane _PROTEIN_ acid causes minor suppression . remarkably _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ significantly correlates with the _PROTEIN_ of other _PROTEIN_ genes as well as several genes associated with rna synthesis or processing . _PROTEIN_ is also highly _PROTEIN_ in dry and imbibed seed tissue as well as the shoot apex throughout development . to determine the biological relevance of its b. cinerea induced gene _PROTEIN_ we characterized plants harboring a null t dna insertion allele of the _PROTEIN_ gene . the pgn mutation resulted in enhanced susceptibility to a. brassicicola as evidenced by increased chlorosis and necrosis at the site of inoculation . compared to the wild type pgn leaves develop significantly larger disease lesions and support increased fungal proliferation . the pgn mutant is also susceptible to b. cinerea . following spray inoculation pgn plants display increased chlorosis and tissue maceration d after inoculation that progresses into abundant leaf decay around d after inoculation . despite relatively slow symptom development fungal growth in the pgn mutant is higher than the wild type just h after inoculation based on transcript accumulation of the constitutive b. cinerea actina gene . additionally we assayed pgn plants for altered resistance to the bacterial pathogen p. syringae to further clarify _PROTEIN_ function in _PROTEIN_ regulated defense responses and determine if the altered susceptibility of the mutant to necrotrophic infection is a result of hormone mediated defense antagonism . plant immune responses to necrotrophic infection are regulated by ja/et mediated signaling events known to antagonize sa dependent defenses associated with biotrophic resistance . no difference was observed in bacterial growth between wild type plants and the pgn mutant inoculated with virulent or avirulent strains of p. syringae . interestingly b. cinerea induced _PROTEIN_ of pr and _PROTEIN_ considered molecular markers of sa and ja/et dependent defense responses respectively are not altered in the pgn mutant . overall these results suggest the function of _PROTEIN_ in pathogen resistance is specific to necrotrophs and not associated with sa ja or et mediated defenses . _PROTEIN_ is predicted to encode a _PROTEIN_ with significant homology to proteins from different plant species and arabidopsis spanning full length amino acid sequences . the _PROTEIN_ protein shows the characteristics of the e _PROTEIN_ subclass with a s p l s p l s l s p s e e repeat and motif arrangement . the repeats are predicted to form a superhelix compromised of two antiparallel helices able to bind dna or rna with substrate specificity dependent on the residue properties within the groove . in arabidopsis there are more than predicted _PROTEIN_ with all described proteins localized to mitochondria chloroplast or _LOCATION_ . of the e _PROTEIN_ subfamily more than are predicted to localize to mitochondria . prediction _METHOD_ indicate _PROTEIN_ has a cleavable targeting sequence _METHOD_ and a likelihood of subcellular localization to mitochondria . to experimentally determine the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was transiently _PROTEIN_ in nicotiana benthamiana leaves in conjunction with different cellular markers . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ colocalized with a mitochondrial marker consistent with the in silico predictions . to further study the function of _PROTEIN_ overexpression _PROTEIN_ and complementation lines _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were generated . the different _PROTEIN_ genotypes were assayed for altered responses to hormones and abiotic stress agents in an effort to clarify the mechanism of _PROTEIN_ function in arabidopsis defense . the pgn mutant displays germination hypersensitivity to media supplemented with aba and increased glc . overexpression of _PROTEIN_ also results in hypersensitivity to aba and glc comparable to that of the mutant . similarly the pgn mutant and overexpression lines have increased sensitivity to salt displaying increased salt induced necrosis and chlorosis as well as reduced germination and root growth compared to wild type seedlings . alternatively both pgn and _PROTEIN_ pgn plants have enhanced growth on murashige and skoog _METHOD_ media lacking glc relative to the wild type . in general transformation with genomic _PROTEIN_ driven by its native promoter _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ restores mutant sensitivity to wild type levels . however at higher concentrations of aba salt and glc _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ pgn seedlings have significantly reduced leaf emergence root growth and smaller cotyledons respectively relative to the wild type . this disparity could be attributed to the slightly higher _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ of these lines compared to the wild type and further supports the hypersensitivity exhibited by _PROTEIN_ pgn plants . overall these data suggest that in addition to defense against necrotrophic infection _PROTEIN_ regulates plant responses to abiotic stress and its _PROTEIN_ level is an important determinant of function . no altered seedling growth was observed when pregerminated d seedlings were transferred to media supplemented with glc aba or indole acetic acid . also germination on media supplemented with acc meja sa ga indole acetic acid or hydrogen peroxide is not affected by the pgn mutation limiting the role of _PROTEIN_ to a specific subset of stress and hormone responses . increased concentrations of glc are known to delay arabidopsis germination with aba levels determining the severity of inhibition . many mutants exhibiting enhanced growth on media containing high exogenous sugars are also aba insensitive whereas even minimal aba increases act additively to sugar mediated seedling growth inhibition . to determine if pgn hypersensitivity to glc and aba is a result of increased endogenous aba we assayed growth responses to glc in the presence of two aba inhibitors the et precursor acc and norflurazon . et antagonizes aba function in germination likely promoting emergence through suppression of aba signaling and synthesis initiated by glc and aba . nf inhibits aba accumulation through disruption of carotenoid biosynthesis upstream of aba biosynthesis . addition of acc or nf partially relieved pgn hypersensitivity to glc relative to glc alone . interestingly whereas acc restored pgn growth to a degree comparable to respective wild type controls the effect of nf resulted in seedlings nearly half the size of corresponding wild type . these data suggest that the increased glc sensitivity exhibited by the pgn mutant is likely due to high levels of endogenous aba . subsequent analysis of total aba content indicates that pgn seedlings do have significantly higher basal levels of aba compared to the wild type . the growth variation between treatments may be explained by disparities in the mechanism by which they inhibit aba responses . acc suppresses aba accumulation and signaling whereas nf only disrupts aba biosynthesis . thus based on its phenotypes the pgn mutant may be altered in aba levels as well as signaling . alternatively variation may be a result of secondary effects of treatment such as nf inhibition of ga synthesis . however based on the normal responses of the mutant to ga and other plant hormones we limited our conclusions to the effects of these chemicals on aba responses for which pgn is clearly altered . the independent restoration of growth responses with either acc or nf also serves to further strengthen an aba dependent mechanism . interestingly low levels of glc also have an inhibitory effect on germination yet the effect is lessened in aba sensitive and insensitive mutants . thus the enhanced growth of pgn on media lacking glc lends further support to its increased sensitivity to aba . generally aba and et function antagonistically with most et insensitive mutants showing sensitivity to aba and vice versa . our data suggest that pgn mutation leads to disrupted aba responses that can be partially restored through et mediated antagonism . this implies that loss of _PROTEIN_ function is likely to cause insensitivity to et . however instead of increased tolerance the pgn mutant exhibits enhanced et sensitivity as observed by an altered triple response . the triple response is induced when plants are grown in the dark on media containing et or its precursor acc producing seedlings with exaggerated apical hooks swollen hypocotyls and inhibited root/hypocotyl elongation . in response to acc pgn seedlings produce shorter hypocotyls with limited root growth compared to the wild type . ectopic _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ also results in an enhanced triple response comparable to that of the mutant consistent with either loss or gain of _PROTEIN_ function resulting in the same phenotypes . loss of _PROTEIN_ function results in hypersensitivity to aba as well as salt and glc . to determine if this _PROTEIN_ tolerance is due to altered aba signaling we assayed the mutant for altered _PROTEIN_ of aba responsive marker genes associated with activation of abiotic stress responses . salt induced _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ is not altered by the pgn mutation . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are aba responsive genes with varying roles in salt sugar and osmotic stress tolerance . by contrast _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are all induced at lower levels in the pgn mutant in response to salt or aba . salt induce.d _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is also slightly reduced in pgn but induction by aba was unaffected by mutation . interestingly pgn has higher _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in response to both aba and nacl compared to the wild type . _PROTEIN_ is the most significantly affected by pgn mutation showing nearly times greater _PROTEIN_ in the mutant compared to wild type _PROTEIN_ induction in response to aba . _PROTEIN_ encodes a transcription _PROTEIN_ involved in aba signaling and functions downstream of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in photooxidative stress responses . to further define _PROTEIN_ function in resistance to necrotrophic infection with respect to aba and et signaling we examined its _PROTEIN_ in mutants with altered aba and et responses . in response to b. cinerea _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was not altered in _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ . mutation in the et receptor _PROTEIN_ results in significantly _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ which is consistent with our results and suggests neither of these genes contribute to regulation of _PROTEIN_ during infection . by contrast inoculated _PROTEIN_ and _LOCATION_ mutants exhibit markedly higher _PROTEIN_ induction . _LOCATION_ is a positive regulator of ja/et mediated defenses that functions partially through antagonism of aba responses . thus _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ may increase as aba responses are relieved from _LOCATION_ mediated repression . however mutation in _PROTEIN_ a positive regulator of aba signaling also causes increased induction suggesting that altered _PROTEIN_ in these mutants may be linked to a secondary effect or that _PROTEIN_ regulation is not solely dependent on aba responses . in addition basal _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ regulatory _PROTEIN_ is significantly repressed in the pgn mutant . _PROTEIN_ encodes a wd protein that functions in global regulation of sugar stress and hormone responses as well as basal defense in arabidopsis . based on literature searches _PROTEIN_ was the only mutant we could identify with increased sensitivity to glc aba and et similar to that observed for pgn . recently the _PROTEIN_ gene was isolated from a screen for aba sensitive arabidopsis mutants . in addition to aba the _PROTEIN_ mutant is also sensitive to salt and oxidative stress . _PROTEIN_ encodes a mitochondrial _PROTEIN_ important for the function of complex iii in electron transport . due to the remarkable similarity of stress response phenotypes and shared subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ we studied their functional relationship . the _PROTEIN_ mutant has significantly higher basal _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ that becomes repressed after b. cinerea infection . this pattern of _PROTEIN_ is in direct contrast to that in wild type plants suggesting that _PROTEIN_ may function in the regulation of _PROTEIN_ transcription . interestingly _PROTEIN_ mutation results in a loss of resistance to b. cinerea comparable to that resulting from loss of _PROTEIN_ function . we also assayed the pgn mutant for tolerance to oxidative stresses . detached leaf treatment with methyl viologen an herbicide that generates ros did not indicate any impaired oxidative stress tolerance in the pgn mutant . additionally there was no significant difference in chlorophyll content between pgn and wild type seedlings treated with or mv as observed for the _PROTEIN_ mutant . however untreated pgn seedlings had significantly lower total chlorophyll content compared to the wild type . this difference was not observed in week old plants . thus it appears that the pgn mutation does not affect oxidative stress tolerance in response to mv or though it does lead to reduced chlorophyll levels in seedlings . thus _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ appear to have overlapping as well as distinct functions in arabidopsis stress and defense responses . _PROTEIN_ s localization to mitochondria and putative function in rna metabolism prompted us to assay _PROTEIN_ of mitochondria associated transcripts in the mutant . pgn has significantly higher salt induced alternative oxidase _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ also showing increased basal _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ proteins and _PROTEIN_ serve as nonphosphorylating bypasses of mitochondrial electron transport whereas _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are associated with cytochrome c biogenesis and oxidation respectively . _PROTEIN_ induction also serves as a marker of mitochondrial retrograde responses in arabidopsis . no significant differences in _PROTEIN_ were observed for the extensively edited mitochondrial _PROTEIN_ transcript _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ encoding a protein of unknown function an nad h dehydrogenase subunit and nad h dehydrogenases and respectively . yet the pgn mutant has significantly higher basal _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ transcript which is trans spliced by the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and encodes an nad h dehydrogenase subunit associated with mitochondrial respiratory chain complex i . _PROTEIN_ encoding a constituent of the large subunit of the mitochondrial ribosome is also elevated in the mutant but gets repressed following salt treatment . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are _PROTEIN_ at lower levels in pgn both before and after treatment with the rna maturase gene _PROTEIN_ showing the highest degree of suppression caused by pgn mutation . consistent with germination assays in which both high and low _PROTEIN_ levels led to increased sensitivity to aba salt and glc _PROTEIN_ overexpression resulted in enhanced susceptibility to b. cinerea similar to that observed for the mutant . infected wild type and complemented _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plants shared similar levels of resistance without any observable differences in disease _METHOD_ . thus the level of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ appears to influence the extent of plant susceptibility to b. cinerea consistent with results obtained for germination responses to abiotic stress agents . however the threshold for transcript levels that alter responses appears to be lower for germination as the marginal increase in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ pgn plants results in weak sensitivity to abiotic stresses but has no effect on resistance to b. cinerea . to determine if altered mitochondrial function in management of ros is a contributing _PROTEIN_ in pgn susceptibility the _PROTEIN_ genotypes were inoculated with b. cinerea and incubated under constant light or dark . under dark conditions pgn and the overexpression line _PROTEIN_ had significantly enhanced susceptibility relative to infected wild type and complemented _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plants as well as all plants incubated in light . although light grown plants _PROTEIN_ susceptibility continuous darkness significantly enhanced disease _METHOD_ . thus pgn susceptibility appears to be linked to impaired b. cinerea induced ros detoxification as under dark conditions this process becomes largely dependent on mitochondrial functions . the effect of pgn mutation on ros metabolism was further confirmed by histochemical staining for the presence of using diaminobenzidine in salt treated seedlings . whereas minimal increases in were observed in the leaf margins of wild type seedlings leaves of pgn seedlings incubated in mm nacl were intensely and wholly stained . recent studies have shown that _PROTEIN_ is a dna binding _PROTEIN_ involved in retrograde signaling from the chloroplast . the _PROTEIN_ mutant exhibits higher light harvesting _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ than the wild type after treatment with nf or lincomycin . both chemicals disrupt chloroplast protein biosynthesis leading to mg protoix accumulation . mg protoix acts as a signal repressing _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ of photosynthetic genes specifically the lhcb family . many of the genes affected by _PROTEIN_ mutation are involved in aba signaling with _PROTEIN_ acting as a downstream component of the _PROTEIN_ regulated retrograde response pathway to photooxidative stress . _PROTEIN_ is a transcriptional regulator of sugar signaling required for plant responses to aba glc and salt . based on the hypersensitive phenotypes and altered _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in the pgn mutant we assayed the level of _PROTEIN_ transcripts in nf treated pgn to determine if it plays a role in _LOCATION_ to _LOCATION_ signaling . in response to nf _PROTEIN_ was repressed in both wild type and pgn seedlings without any observable difference in the level of suppression suggesting that _PROTEIN_ does not function in photooxidative retrograde signaling .
