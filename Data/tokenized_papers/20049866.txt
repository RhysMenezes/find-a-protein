the regulation of stromal enzymes by thioredoxin disulphide/dithiol exchange is known as a classical mechanism for control of chloroplast metabolism . recent proteome studies show that trx targets are present not only in the stroma but in all chloroplast compartments from the envelope to the _LOCATION_ lumen . redox control appears to be a common feature of important pathways such as the calvin cycle starch synthesis and tetrapyrrole biosynthesis . however the extent of redox regulation in the _LOCATION_ lumen has not been previously systematically explored . in this study we addressed redox control in the chloroplast lumen of arabidopsis thaliana . using complementary proteomics approaches we identified trx target proteins thus covering more than of the currently known lumenal chloroplast proteome . we show that the redox state of thiols is decisive for degradation of the extrinsic _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ subunits of photosystem ii . moreover disulphide reduction inhibits activity of the xanthophyll cycle enzyme violaxanthin which participates in thermal dissipation of excess absorbed light . our results indicate that reactions in the chloroplast lumen play essential roles in the function of photosystem ii and the regulation of _PROTEIN_ to light intensity .
to start screening for lumenal proteins that might be reduced by trx preparations of the chloroplast lumen from arabidopsis were treated with the commercially available e. coli ntr/trx system citation citation . subsequently thiols generated upon reduction of disulphides were detected by _METHOD_ electrophoresis using mbbr as a marker . to improve the specificity of the labelling by mbbr thiols of the lumenal proteins were blocked with nem prior to the treatment with reduced trx . this led to almost complete suppression of background signals . in each of these analyses three replicate samples were used one of which was reduced for min using both ntr/trx and nadph . the other two samples served as controls to one of which ntr/trx was added but not nadph while nadph was added to the other but not ntr/trx . the _METHOD_ image of the gel displayed in fig . shows the samples prepared in this experiment . the lane containing lumenal proteins labelled with mbbr after reduction using nadph and ntr/trx exhibits ten _METHOD_ bands . control samples treated with ntr/trx without nadph displayed some background signals that were caused by contaminating proteins in the ntr batch used . however in controls treated with nadph but not ntr/trx essentially no background signals from free thiols were observed demonstrating that nem efficiently alkylated these thiols . the results also show that no endogenous activity is present in the soluble lumen fraction . in contrast a clear band of reduced trx with an apparent _METHOD_ of kda was obtained from blanks . resolution of the lumenal chloroplast proteins in gels provided more detailed observations . identification by pmf showed that the most strongly labelled proteins from the arabidopsis chloroplast lumen were the extrinsic psii subunits _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ the immunophilin _PROTEIN_ and the pentapeptide protein _PROTEIN_ . other labelled proteins we detected included the xanthophyll cycle enzyme vde the pentapeptide protein _PROTEIN_ and the kda protein _GENE_ . in further experiments we also observed reproducible mbbr labelling of the peroxiredoxin _PROTEIN_ the extrinsic psii subunit and the _PROTEIN_ protein . the analysis of lumenal trx targets using _METHOD_ electrophoresis indicated that the chloroplast lumen is rich in proteins that could be reduced by trx . however due to potential on the gels some of the proteins that were apparently associated with _METHOD_ may not have reacted with trx . for this reason a complementary analysis was performed using differential alkylation . in this experiment the thiols exposed upon reduction by ntr/trx were alkylated using the reagents iam and dma which results in different _METHOD_ shifts of peptides in subsequent _METHOD_ analysis . this strategy provides not only unambiguous identification of the target proteins but also information about which cysteine residues react with trx . to screen for trx targets the labelled lumenal chloroplast proteins were separated by and visualised by cbb staining for subsequent screening by _METHOD_ . proteins were considered as targets of trx if their _METHOD_ spectra consistently showed peptides that were labelled both in experiments using iam and dma . as an example a maldi spectrum of the kda psbp domain protein is shown in the insert in fig . and the peaks of the peptides are marked with asterisks . the proteins reduced by trx in this series of experiments are indicated on the gel shown in fig . and the cysteines carrying differential labels are listed in table . comparison with the results from the _METHOD_ electrophoresis analysis showed that essentially the same targets were detected . the only differences were that the psii subunit was detected by _METHOD_ electrophoresis but not by differential alkylation and vice versa for the immunophilin _PROTEIN_ . a summary of the identifications by pmf of the trx targets found in these thiol approaches is presented in supporting information table . in one form of trx affinity chromatography a monocysteinic trx immobilised on a nickel affinity _PROTEIN_ is employed citation citation . in this study we used a monocysteinic version of the trx from the cyanobacterium synechocystis sp . pcc since this enzyme has been shown to be a highly efficient bait for trx target proteins citation . following binding of lumenal proteins to the immobilised by mixed disulphide formation the _PROTEIN_ was washed with a low concentration solution of imidazole to remove interacting proteins . finally the complexes were eluted using a high concentration solution of imidazole . the profiles from this chromatographic procedure are shown in fig . including the lumenal proteins before application to the column the proteins the wash and the eluate . a comparison of the lanes displaying the initial lumenal fraction and the proteins shows that some proteins _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were specifically retained on the _PROTEIN_ . furthermore the eluate lane displayed more than ten different protein bands apart from the highly abundant used as bait . ten of the eluted proteins were identified by pmf and are indicated in fig . and supporting information table . to resolve the lumenal proteins isolated by trx affinity chromatography more thoroughly eluates were subjected to _PROTEIN_ under conditions in the first dimension and reducing conditions in the second citation citation . for the first dimension proteins were separated using _PROTEIN_ in the absence of reducing agents . lanes excised from the resulting gels were treated with dtt and applied to a second _PROTEIN_ . the mixed disulphides remained intact in the first dimension but the targets were released and separated from in the second dimension . hence lumenal proteins that bound to the monocysteinic _PROTEIN_ migrated below the diagonal indicated by the standard protein markers . a _METHOD_ between the first and second dimensions of approximately kda corresponds to the additional _METHOD_ of one bound trx molecule thus confirming its interaction with the target . this pattern was observed for several proteins including the cyclophilin _PROTEIN_ the protease _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . other target proteins such as vde displayed patterns consistent with the binding of at least two molecules of trx in the first dimension and some targets such as the peroxiredoxin _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were distributed between two or more spots . an advantage of this protocol is that it can discriminate between true targets and possible contaminants that would be equally retained in both dimensions . therefore lumenal proteins that migrated exclusively along the diagonal such as _PROTEIN_ were not considered as trx targets . the _PROTEIN_ could not be unambiguously identified by _METHOD_ among the targets eluted from trx affinity chromatography column and resolved by although it was detected by . however comparison of the _PROTEIN_ band in the lumenal fraction and protein lanes of the gels used to analyse the results of the trx affinity chromatography indicated that _PROTEIN_ bound to . therefore we analysed the fraction of eluted proteins by immunoblotting using specific peptide antibodies raised against _PROTEIN_ of arabidopsis . when the eluate was reduced using mm dtt the antibodies detected a double band with apparent _METHOD_ of and kda which is typical of _PROTEIN_ . however when the eluted proteins were not reduced _PROTEIN_ was detected as a weak band at an apparent _METHOD_ of kda indicating that formed a mixed disulphide with _PROTEIN_ . the two low molecular _METHOD_ proteins _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ which had been identified as putative trx targets in the alkylation experiments were also not confirmed as targets using trx affinity chromatography possibly due to the high abundance of the bait in this molecular _METHOD_ region . since the chloroplast lumen has three pentapeptide proteins two of which _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were detected as trx targets by thiol alkylation we tested the possibility that the third pentapeptide protein _PROTEIN_ might also be a trx target and present in the fraction of proteins . using specific peptide antibodies raised against _PROTEIN_ of arabidopsis the eluted proteins were tested for the presence of _PROTEIN_ before and after reduction by mm dtt . as shown in fig . _PROTEIN_ was detected among the reduced eluted proteins at apparent _METHOD_ of and kda . however _PROTEIN_ was not detected among the unreduced eluted proteins indicating that the epitope recognized by the antibodies in _PROTEIN_ is not accessible in the mixed disulphide formed with . the apparent presence of two _METHOD_ of _PROTEIN_ with slightly differing _METHOD_ in the sample of reduced eluted proteins indicates that reduced _PROTEIN_ was degraded since only a kda band was detected in analyses of samples of purified chloroplast lumen . eight lumenal proteins were detected along the diagonal of the gel displayed in fig . which were not but with true targets and perhaps represented subunits of protein complexes . therefore to detect possible complexes among the soluble lumen proteins and examine the effect of disulphide reduction on their oligomerization we resolved samples of lumenal proteins by native _PROTEIN_ before and after with the e. coli ntr/trx reduction system in the presence and absence of nadph . the resulting gels showed that most proteins migrated more slowly in the first than in the second dimension . treatment of the lumenal fraction with the complete reduction system prior to electrophoresis had two surprising consequences . first the amounts of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ after reduction with e. coli ntr/trx indicating degradation of these proteins . second a fraction of the psbo proteins and _PROTEIN_ appeared to associate with higher _METHOD_ oligomers that were not found in the unreduced control . the molecular mechanism behind the formation of these possible oligomers requires further investigation . the identification of vde as a trx target suggested that reduction by trx might regulate its enzymatic activity . to test this hypothesis vde activity of the lumenal chloroplast fraction was assayed in the presence and absence of reduced e. coli trx . in accordance with the hypothesis more than of the specific activity of vde in lumenal chloroplast fractions was lost in the presence of reduced trx . the gel of lumenal proteins isolated by trx affinity chromatography displayed a series of spots in the kda region corresponding to degradation products of the extrinsic psii proteins _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . since psbo proteins are usually highly stable this observation suggested that reduction of disulphides might destabilise these proteins and make them accessible to an intrinsic lumenal protease . to test this hypothesis we incubated lumenal chloroplast proteins in the presence of reduced e. coli trx and monitored changes in protein levels during h of incubation . analysis by _PROTEIN_ showed that most lumenal proteins remained stable during the experiment and some proteins such as the cyclophilin _PROTEIN_ and the fibrillin _PROTEIN_ were degraded _PROTEIN_ of whether or not reduced trx was present . however the pentapeptide protein _PROTEIN_ and the extrinsic psii subunits _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ showed pronounced degradation in the presence of reduced trx but not in the presence of either ntr/trx without nadph or nadph without ntr/trx . the degradation of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ was further analysed by immunoblotting . following h of incubation in the presence of reduced trx the levels of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were dramatically reduced and after h they were virtually undetectable . in addition breakdown products of the psbo proteins were observed during the initial degradation process . the level of the lumenal trx target _PROTEIN_ and citation was monitored for comparison and as shown in fig . it was not degraded under any of the tested conditions . the proteolysis of the psbo proteins and of _PROTEIN_ was inhibited in the presence of a concentration of tpck that inhibits proteases . however only a weak inhibition of this proteolysis was observed if the same experiment was performed in the presence of a concentration of tlck that inhibits serine proteases .
