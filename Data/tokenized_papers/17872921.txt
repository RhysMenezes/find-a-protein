though numerous pieces of evidence point to major physiological roles for anion channels in plants progress in the understanding of their biological functions is limited by the small number of genes identified so far . seven chloride channel members could be identified in the arabidopsis genome amongst which atclce and atclcf are both more closely related to bacterial clcs than the other plant clcs . it is shown here that atclce is targeted to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ in chloroplasts and in agreement with this subcellular localization that the _PROTEIN_ mutants display a phenotype related to photosynthesis activity . the atclcf protein is localized in _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and functionally complements the yeast mutant disrupted in the single clc gene encoding a _LOCATION_ associated protein .
atclce and atclcf genes show different gene structures with six and eight exons respectively . southern blot analyses revealed that these genes are present as single copies in the genome of two different arabidopsis accessions col and ws . atclce encodes a polypeptide of amino acids with a calculated molecular _METHOD_ of kda atclcf potentially encodes two proteins a short one with a kda calculated molecular _METHOD_ and a longer one with a calculated molecular _METHOD_ of kda . the atclce and atclcf proteins are highly hydrophobic as they showed up to _LOCATION_ spanning domains in agreement with the crystallographic structure of two bacterial clcs resolved by high resolution x ray and revealing the existence of helices . in the phylogenic tree based on protein sequence comparisons most plant clcs including those of arabidopsis belong to a eukaryotic branch except atclce which defines a distinct subfamily with atclcf and some tomato and rice clcs all closely related to bacterial clc proteins . the atclce protein sequence displays amino acid identity with atclcf and identity with animal and other plant clc proteins . the large clc family includes anion channels such as the torpedo fish and the mammalian but also proton coupled chloride transporters such as the bacterial _PROTEIN_ and the mammalian clc and clc . a refined analysis of structure/transport mechanism relationships pointed out the key role of two glutamate residues in the binding region and the latter being a hallmark that distinguishes antiporters from channels . in plants demonstration of the antiporter activity of _PROTEIN_ as a nitrate/proton exchanger occurred very recently . the _PROTEIN_ sequence displays the two glutamate residues as well as atclcb c d and g while both atclce and atclcf possess only suggesting a different transport mechanism . the _PROTEIN_ database did not give strong predictions for the subcellular localization of atclce either in chloroplasts or in mitochondria . nevertheless a close analysis of the n terminal region indicated a global positive charge enrichment in serine and in proline and the presence of an alanine in the second position altogether these features are in favour of a _LOCATION_ localization . the maximum cleavage site was predicted between the amino acids and _PROTEIN_ . transient _PROTEIN_ in onion epidermal cells of a control construct containing _METHOD_ alone resulted in _METHOD_ throughout the _LOCATION_ and within the _LOCATION_ as already reported by citation . atclce _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ resulted in a dotted _METHOD_ pattern restricted to mobile organelles located in the _LOCATION_ with a diameter of about suggesting a _LOCATION_ localization . co _PROTEIN_ of atclce _METHOD_ with sytp ds red which is targeted to both mitochondria and _LOCATION_ revealed that green and red _METHOD_ co localized to a high degree in _LOCATION_ . in addition upon transient _PROTEIN_ of the atclce _METHOD_ construct in protoplasts from arabidopsis cell suspensions a co localization of the fusion protein _METHOD_ and chlorophyll _METHOD_ was observed demonstrating the chloroplast targeting of atclce . to localize atclce further western blot analyses were performed on chloroplast subfractions using both anti _PROTEIN_ an antibody directed against the rat _PROTEIN_ and a purified igg raised against two c terminal regions of the atclce protein . the patterns obtained with anti _PROTEIN_ could not be interpreted as it cross reacted with peptides in chloroplasts envelope and stroma fractions but blots with anti _PROTEIN_ iggs confirmed the chloroplast localization and showed that atclce resides specifically in _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . interestingly from transcriptomics data available in genevestigator tools atclce _PROTEIN_ is higher in green tissues compared with roots . in seedlings atclce is _PROTEIN_ almost four times more in cotyledons than in roots and at an intermediate level in hypocotyls . in other respects looking for functional clues the mutant gene _PROTEIN_ data sets show up regulation of atclce in _PROTEIN_ a leaf developmental mutant and in a _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant altered in _LOCATION_ signalling pathways during de etiolation . in contrast atclce _PROTEIN_ is down regulated in the mutant in which _PROTEIN_ metabolism is affected . altogether these data would support a relationship between green tissue _LOCATION_ localization of atclce and a potential function in chloroplasts . this hypothesis was further investigated searching for a photosynthetic phenotype in _PROTEIN_ mutants . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ homozygous mutant plants exhibit developmental and morphological traits similar to those of wild type plants grown either in vitro or in the greenhouse . looking for a specific phenotypic trait of _PROTEIN_ mutants which could be related to the chloroplast localization of the protein chlorophyll _METHOD_ was measured to assess the photosynthetic activity in vivo . high light intensities induced a strongly polyphasic _METHOD_ time course as previously observed when the photochemical rate i.e . the reduction rate of qa is faster than the reoxidation rate . the first initial rising phase reflects essentially the reduction of qa and for a given light intensity its rate is determined by the photosystem ii antenna size and the photochemical properties of psii . the half time of this phase was similar in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and wild type plants indicating that the light trapping efficiency of psii was unaffected by the mutation . consistent with this the psii quantum yields as determined by the ratio /fm where and fm respectively stand for the _METHOD_ yield when all psiis are photochemically active and inactive were similar . interestingly the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants displayed a marked phenotype with the _METHOD_ increase component developing in the _METHOD_ time range being significantly slowed down whereas the subsequent phase occurring in the _METHOD_ time range remained unaltered . as discussed in citation these two phases reflect the disappearance of a quencher concomitant with the reduction of the plastoquinone pool for the first one and with the reduction of the soluble psi electron acceptors for the subsequent one . it is unlikely that atclce activity has direct consequences on the plastoquinone pool per se . it is thus proposed that the alterations in the kinetics of _METHOD_ changes induced by the illumination of dark _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutant leaves originate from indirect effects such as changes in the ionic strength or osmotic properties of the lumen resulting from an impaired anionic permeability of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . a clc type protein might contribute to anion channel activities previously reported on _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ by citation in the higher plant peperomia metallica and by potossin and in the alga nitellopsis obtusa but no direct evidence for such anion currents in arabidopsis photosynthetic _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ has been provided so far . such modifications in the intra _LOCATION_ ionic status could modify the overall architecture of the _LOCATION_ and hence the reduction of the plastoquinone pool since the formation of the grana stacks is known to depend on the ionic strength . atclcf _METHOD_ _METHOD_ in onion epidermal cells was localized in numerous small organelles showing a brownian movement throughout the _LOCATION_ . the size of these structures allowed _LOCATION_ to be excluded but could correspond to several types of organelles mitochondria _LOCATION_ or _LOCATION_ vesicles . co _PROTEIN_ of atclcf _METHOD_ with sytp ds red led to the exclusion of mitochondrial and chloroplastic locations as green and red _METHOD_ did not overlap . similarly the green _METHOD_ of atclcf _METHOD_ did not match the distribution of the red _METHOD_ displayed by a fusion protein targeted to _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ ds red . treatment of onion epidermal cells _PROTEIN_ atclcf _METHOD_ with brefeldin a a potent inhibitor of endocellular traffic induced aggregation and redistribution of the green _METHOD_ suggesting that the atclcf _METHOD_ protein was associated with a bfa sensitive compartment . this observation is in agreement with a _LOCATION_ targeting of the atclcf protein . to analyse further the subcellular compartmentation of atclcf transient co _PROTEIN_ of atclcf fusions with _METHOD_ markers of cis and trans _LOCATION_ cisternae was achieved in protoplasts from arabidopsis cell suspensions . in tobacco leaves transformed by agro infection the mannosidase i is localized in both _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and cis _LOCATION_ subcompartments . in the present biological system _METHOD_ also showed a dual compartmentation . red _METHOD_ of atclcf and green _METHOD_ of _METHOD_ completely co localized in cis _LOCATION_ vesicles but not in the _LOCATION_ suggesting a targeting of atclcf to the early _LOCATION_ compartment . co _PROTEIN_ of atclcf with a protein targeted to trans _LOCATION_ cisternae was also performed . a partial co localization was observed between a trans _LOCATION_ marker fuct _METHOD_ and atclcf . similar _METHOD_ patterns were obtained when co _PROTEIN_ atclcf _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ fusions . these results obtained in a homologous _PROTEIN_ system confirm that atclcf would reside in _LOCATION_ vesicles . a refined analysis revealed that the fusion protein is _PROTEIN_ targeted to the early cis _LOCATION_ subcompartment and to some extent to trans _LOCATION_ cisternae . this result contrasts with a report on the chloroplast localization in spinach of a putative clc channel sharing sequence similarity with atclcf . in this study biochemical and _METHOD_ _METHOD_ analyses relied on the use of a combination of heterologous tools that may lead to confusing results . the authors _METHOD_ do not exclude the hypothesis of the simultaneous presence of _PROTEIN_ and/or _PROTEIN_ in other subcellular compartments in spinach . the present confocal microscopy analyses revealed that in arabidopsis atclce and atclcf reside in different _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ i.e . _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ respectively suggesting that these proteins might play distinct biological roles . the yeast clc protein scclc has been localized in the _LOCATION_ apparatus most of the protein residing in its medial portion but also in the _PROTEIN_ or post _LOCATION_ vesicles . disruption of the scclc gene in yeast led to a growth defect on iron limited medium containing non fermentable _PROTEIN_ sources . atclcd was first demonstrated to restore iron limited growth of the yeast mutant . _PROTEIN_ on citation showed that other phenotypes of the mutant the ph induced phenotype and salt sensitivity were also suppressed by complementation with atclcd and atclcc but not by _PROTEIN_ . the ability of atclcf and atclce functionally to complement growth defects of the mutant strains and either on a low iron medium or on a high ph medium was tested . figure illustrates the results obtained in the haploid strain . similar pictures were obtained for the diploid strain . no growth was observed in discriminating growth conditions when yeast strains were transformed with the corresponding empty vectors _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . the mutant is unable to grow on non fermentable _PROTEIN_ sources in the absence of high iron concentrations . this growth defect is suppressed in strains that _PROTEIN_ the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ but not atclce . the mutant also failed to grow on the minimal media sd or sge buffered at ph though they grew well on a minimal medium ypd this phenotype was also rescued by the _PROTEIN_ of atclcf . the addition of copper allows growth of all genotypes probably because it restores in background the high affinity iron uptake through the complex . in all discriminating growth conditions _PROTEIN_ of atclce did not complement the two yeast mutant strains probably as a consequence of its chloroplast localization . in all cases atclcf _PROTEIN_ in the background was able to restore growth of the mutant strains although at a lower rate compared with the wild type strain or with the positive control represented by the strain _PROTEIN_ atclcd . recently atclcd has been shown to co localize in the trans _LOCATION_ network with vha a subunit of the proton transporting v type _PROTEIN_ . these data suggest that atclcd would be involved in the transport of a counter anion for compensating acidification of the luminal ph in the trans _LOCATION_ network required during endocytic and secretory processes . the present data illustrate that atclcf is functional in yeast cells and provide evidence for its ability to complement the ph dependent growth phenotype of the mutant . atclcf might thus play a role in delivering anions to facilitate the luminal acidification of the cis _LOCATION_ subcompartment . here the molecular cloning and preliminary biological characterization of atclce and atclcf two new arabidopsis genes encoding putative plant clc anion channels are reported . in contrast to _PROTEIN_ these two proteins are located in _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ which are not easily amenable to electrophysiology techniques and this hampers progress to demonstrate their genuine channel or transporter activity . however the identification of the subcellular localization of the proteins in _LOCATION_ or _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ together with mutant analysis and yeast complementation assays provides the first clues as to their cellular functions . such functions appear specific to plant cells or similar to those described for yeast and some of the mammalian clcs _LOCATION_ . we thank c
