ten arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ homologues were identified from a blast search using the _METHOD_ . analysis based on protein sequences showed that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fall into three distinct clades . although members within a clade can have different organizations of domains all members of clade ii in particular lack a tmd and have the _METHOD_ located centrally rather than at the amino terminus . the majority of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ show _PROTEIN_ across a variety of tissues as shown by the genevestigator analysis . in addition to many other tissues _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ show a peak of transcription in pollen . the tissues in which we find the transcription of _PROTEIN_ and are much more limited . _PROTEIN_ is confined to the shoot pollen and stele . _PROTEIN_ is only found in the leaf although transcription is also seen in the mesophyll and root primary cell culture . five of the ten _PROTEIN_ proteins were used to make chimeric constructs with _METHOD_ at the . these constructs were used for transient transfection of n. benthamiana leaf epidermal cells in order to study their intracellular localization and behaviour . our previous study showed that _PROTEIN_ is an _LOCATION_ integral _LOCATION_ protein which also localizes to epcs . a similar localization pattern was observed for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ representative members of clades i and iii respectively . both proteins localized to the _LOCATION_ network confirmed by their with cyan _METHOD_ _METHOD_ in addition to immobile punctate structures previously identified as epcss . at the cell periphery _PROTEIN_ puncta appeared to with the pm . signals from the rest of the _LOCATION_ were very distinct from the pm . by contrast two members from clade ii of the _PROTEIN_ family namely _METHOD_ fusions of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ localized to the pm . they are very likely to be _LOCATION_ peripheral proteins recruited to the pm from a cytoplasmic pool . _METHOD_ also labelled some immobile puncta and was also found to be concentrated in the nucleolus . _PROTEIN_ belongs to a family of proteins the net family it locates to the epcs . we have shown previously that _PROTEIN_ and interacts with _PROTEIN_ at these sites . in this study we showed that _METHOD_ also with _METHOD_ at epcs when in the transient _PROTEIN_ system . we confirmed the physical interaction between red _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ in vivo using microscopy . the _METHOD_ lifetime of _METHOD_ was found to be ns which reduces significantly in the presence of _METHOD_ indicating that they interact in a complex . it should be noted that the lifetime of _METHOD_ in the _LOCATION_ does not change as no _PROTEIN_ is present and this also acts as an internal control for this study . a second negative control was carried out using _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ the lifetime of _METHOD_ in cells _PROTEIN_ both constructs was measured at ns and this indicates that these two proteins which localize to the same compartment do not interact and therefore do not undergo fret . in order to assess the level of translational _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ each gene was ligated in frame with gus at the end of each open reading frame . _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis revealed that both proteins are _PROTEIN_ ubiquitously similar to their predicted transcriptional _PROTEIN_ profiles . arabidopsis leaf epidermal cells were then used for further immunolabelling studies . a polyclonal antibody raised against _PROTEIN_ in mice yielded a single band on a western blot of a total protein extract from arabidopsis seedlings at a molecular weight similar to that for _PROTEIN_ . this antibody is specific to _PROTEIN_ when compared with its to _PROTEIN_ proteins which have high overall sequence similarity . cotyledons from a stable arabidopsis line _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were high pressure frozen and freeze substituted for tem and immunogold studies . the area of association between the _LOCATION_ and pm was much enhanced by the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ . gaps between the _LOCATION_ and pm were almost undetectable . _PROTEIN_ was found throughout the _LOCATION_ network as well as at the epcs . _METHOD_ studies using arabidopsis leaf epidermal cells identified endogenous _PROTEIN_ on the _LOCATION_ network _PROTEIN_ as well as on some _LOCATION_ puncta distinct from the _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ . the epcs labelling of endogenous _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis was not as pronounced as _METHOD_ in the tobacco transient _PROTEIN_ system and this is probably because of the amount of protein present with more _METHOD_ being available in the transiently _PROTEIN_ cells . the _PROTEIN_ signal was found at the same position as the _PROTEIN_ signal on the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . by contrast _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were only partially at the putative epcs . this makes sense because _PROTEIN_ are actively recruited to the epcs whereas other _LOCATION_ proteins are not . two strips of the same western blot of a gel loaded with n. benthamiana leaf extract _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were probed with _PROTEIN_ antibody and _PROTEIN_ antibody with _PROTEIN_ peptide immunogen . incubation of the _PROTEIN_ peptide immunogen with the _PROTEIN_ antibody abolished the ability of the antibody to detect a band on the western blot equivalent to _METHOD_ indicating the antibody 's specificity for _PROTEIN_ . of the _PROTEIN_ peptide immunogen with the _PROTEIN_ antibody and the use of this mixture to stain arabidopsis cells revealed no staining of the _LOCATION_ and epcs in planta further supporting the specificity of the _PROTEIN_ antibody used in this study . in summary the results from immunocytochemistry are consistent with the live cell imaging data confirming _PROTEIN_ as an _LOCATION_ and protein in plants . we suggest that _PROTEIN_ proteins from clades i and iii specifically _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ have a similar cellular location in arabidopsis as their sequences are very similar to _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and their localization in n. benthamiana is the same . stably transformed arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ driven by its native promoter exhibited a similar subcellular localization to that observed when using the same construct in the n. benthamiana transient _PROTEIN_ system . numerous _LOCATION_ puncta were identified reminiscent of the epcss seen in leaf epidermal studies . however these puncta were not seen in all cells . for example in trichome development epcs labelling was only seen in mature trichomes and was not found in the earlier developmental stages . this is either because epcs may not exist in this type of cell or other proteins may be involved in epcs formation . _PROTEIN_ epcss were found in close association with both the microtubule and actin _LOCATION_ in trichomes of the arabidopsis stably transformed lines and in transiently _PROTEIN_ n. benthamiana leaf epidermal cells . in arabidopsis trichomes for example the percentages of epcss that were associated with the actin _LOCATION_ and with microtubules were found to be and respectively . a random association assessed by rotating the red channel _METHOD_ by with respect to the green channel _METHOD_ gave a percentage association of which is significantly lower than the percentage association between epcs and actin or microtubules indicating that their association with the _LOCATION_ is a valid result . _PROTEIN_ epcss are often located at the between and microtubules . this result supports the observation that part of the _LOCATION_ subdomain interacts with microtubules forming _LOCATION_ . however these contact sites do not appear to be _PROTEIN_ by the _LOCATION_ as they still exist when either or microtubules are removed by drug treatments . a population of _METHOD_ epcss also associated with pds as revealed by the of aniline blue staining of callose suggesting that pds may perform a similar function to the epcs at the cell cell border in _METHOD_ of anchoring the peripheral _LOCATION_ . in this context it is known that the desmotubule of pds is made up of highly constricted _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and as such a role of _PROTEIN_ in anchoring the peripheral _LOCATION_ to the plasmodesmal channel is an attractive hypothesis . leaf epidermal cells _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were treated with mannitol to induce plasmolysis designed to separate the pm from the cell wall _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . as a consequence hechtian strands were found in the plasmolysed cells that link the cell wall and pm . surprisingly most of the _PROTEIN_ epcss were found within or at the tips of hechtian strands . thus we suggest that the plant _LOCATION_ complex must interact indirectly with the cell wall through some proteins which holds them together during plasmolysis whilst the rest of the _LOCATION_ network is separated from the cell periphery . subsequently protoplasts were isolated from _METHOD_ leaves to study the influence of the cell wall on the epcs . after photobleaching the recovery of _PROTEIN_ at the epcs was calculated as . it is known that the cell wall can be regenerated around protoplasts . no cell wall staining was seen at h when the protoplasts were freshly prepared whereas staining was seen at c. h after isolation . when the cell wall reformed the maximum recovery of _PROTEIN_ was reduced to significantly different from its recovery at h . these differences in the percentage recovery indicate that the immobile fraction of _PROTEIN_ within the photobleached region is greater when the cell wall has regenerated . this also indicates that the association between _PROTEIN_ epcss and the cell wall makes _PROTEIN_ largely immobile . however the of recovery at both time points did not change significantly indicating that the dynamics of _PROTEIN_ in the photobleached regions at h and c. h are similar . in conclusion these results indicate that the cell wall affects the percentage recovery of the protein _PROTEIN_ . we suggest that this phenomenon is a result of the interaction of _PROTEIN_ with a protein that both spans the pm and interacts with the cell wall and the epcss at either terminus or that _PROTEIN_ associates with a pm subdomain whose mobility is constricted by the cell wall . recently the physical association of the cell wall with the pm has been implicated in the anchoring of many different proteins in the pm . both scenarios could affect the protein dynamics at the pm and subsequently the epcs . _PROTEIN_ of constructs in the n. benthamiana transient system can be obtained by increasing the optical density of the agrobacteria used for infiltration . when highly _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ interacts with _PROTEIN_ and induces the formation of _LOCATION_ cisternae which are labelled by _METHOD_ suggesting that these cisternae are _LOCATION_ derived . epcs labelling may still be seen in some parts of the cell but the significant deformation of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ makes these sites difficult to resolve . these _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ cisternae are closely attached to the pm as seen by the close association with _METHOD_ at the cell cortex . some structures in negative contrast can be observed within the _LOCATION_ cisternae and these with microtubules _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . this pattern in _LOCATION_ has been described previously in several studies of pm integral proteins . this is probably a result of the corralling of pm proteins by cortical microtubules . not surprisingly these negative images of microtubules disappear when microtubules are depolymerized by apm treatment . the enhanced association between the _LOCATION_ and pm is only seen when both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are present and _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ alone does not induce this phenomenon . this result suggests that only a small fraction of _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ can interact with _PROTEIN_ to form the epcs under native conditions when both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ are limiting . however an excess level of both proteins appears to glue the entire cortical _LOCATION_ system to the pm and induce this abnormal cellular phenotype . three distinct functional domains are found in _PROTEIN_ namely an _METHOD_ a tmd and a ccd . domain deletion mutants of _PROTEIN_ were prepared and fused to _METHOD_ . _PROTEIN_ was found to be _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ was still _LOCATION_ localized but less puncta were observed than for _PROTEIN_ . the numbers of puncta were found to be per for _PROTEIN_ compared with per for _PROTEIN_ . _METHOD_ formed numerous _LOCATION_ puncta most of which were much more mobile than the _PROTEIN_ puncta at epcss . similar results were also obtained from a deletion study of another clade i _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . little alteration of the _LOCATION_ network was seen in either _PROTEIN_ or deletion cells . therefore the anchoring of the _LOCATION_ to the pm in plants may be complex and is likely to involve multiple proteins including the association with _PROTEIN_ and possibly synaptotagmins . protein dynamics within these puncta were studied using frap . the maximum recovery of _PROTEIN_ was found to be reduced compared with _PROTEIN_ . _METHOD_ showed almost no recovery over the same period . these results indicate that both _METHOD_ and ccd are important for the localization of _PROTEIN_ at the epcs and most likely protein dynamics within the _LOCATION_ whereas the tmd determines the _LOCATION_ localization of _PROTEIN_ . previously we have identified a functional motif on the _METHOD_ required for the interaction between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . this result is consistent with an observation from the of _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ deletion mutants in this study . that is of _METHOD_ is only seen with _PROTEIN_ which contains the intact _METHOD_ whereas no is seen between _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ . we stably transformed arabidopsis producing lines _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ driven by their native promoters . as we have shown that the _METHOD_ constructs localize to the epcs in a pattern also observed using in planta and that from yeast studies chimeric proteins _PROTEIN_ are functional these constructs are likely to be functional in plants . these plants exhibit defects in pollen seed and root development . the most notable defect is in root hair development where hairs appear branched . high magnification images of these abnormal root hairs are shown in fig . . this phenotype is also observed in _PROTEIN_ rnai lines which show a significant of endogenous _PROTEIN_ protein _PROTEIN_ . a root hair phenotype is also seen in plants _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ as well as in _PROTEIN_ rnai lines . the percentage of branched root hairs was calculated for each line and there were c. abnormal root hairs in the _METHOD_ lines and c. in _PROTEIN_ rnai lines . these observations were consistent in more than three independent transformed lines . it is interesting that a similar phenomenon is seen in either _PROTEIN_ or studies . these data suggest that tight control of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is essential . a similar phenomenon is observed when the actin regulating protein actin depolymerizing _PROTEIN_ is both and knocked down . in the _PROTEIN_ lines both the _LOCATION_ and actin networks in the branched root hair were significantly different from those in the . _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ aggregates formed at the point at which the root hairs branched and the actin network appeared disorganized in this zone . root hair phenotypes have been observed previously when certain _LOCATION_ or proteins are disrupted . in conclusion the _PROTEIN_ protein family was identified and representative candidates were selected for further functional characterization . proteins from clades i and iii localized to the _LOCATION_ network as well as the epcss whereas members of clade ii were found at the pm . the functions of the different domains were characterized using _PROTEIN_ and as examples . we demonstrated that _METHOD_ and ccd are required for protein protein interaction and that tmd is required for intracellular localization . pleiotropic defects were seen in plants _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and also in _PROTEIN_ rnai lines suggesting that they are essential for normal plant development . our results also suggest an indirect association between epcss and the cell wall probably mediated through interaction with proteins .
