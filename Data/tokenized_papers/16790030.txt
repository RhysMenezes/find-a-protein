the arabidopsis dna ligase gene _PROTEIN_ is indispensable for cell viability . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ one major and two minor mrna transcripts differing only in the length of the untranslated leader sequences preceding a common orf . control of _PROTEIN_ isoform production and intracellular targeting depends upon _METHOD_ controlling the choice of translation initiation site within the _PROTEIN_ orf . confocal laser scanning microscopy of green _METHOD_ protein tagged _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis revealed that translation of _PROTEIN_ mrna transcripts from the first in frame start codon produces an _PROTEIN_ isoform that is targeted exclusively to the mitochondria . translation initiation from the second in frame start codon produces an _PROTEIN_ isoform targeted only to the _LOCATION_ . there is no evidence for _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ being targeted to chloroplasts . the mitochondrial _PROTEIN_ isoform possesses both an n terminal mitochondrial targeting signal and an internal bipartite _LOCATION_ localization signal yet is targeted only to mitochondria demonstrating a hierarchical dominance of the mitochondrial presequence over the nls . the length of the utr and more significantly the nucleotide context around alternative start codons in the _PROTEIN_ transcripts affect translation initiation to ensure a balanced synthesis of both _LOCATION_ and mitochondrial _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ probably via a context dependent leaky ribosome scanning mechanism .
a combination of rlm _PROTEIN_ and an rnase protection assay _PROTEIN_ was used to investigate _PROTEIN_ transcript patterns . rlm _PROTEIN_ an approach that detects only authentic capped ends of mrnas was used to identify potential transcription initiation sites in the _PROTEIN_ gene . three bands were obtained after the _PROTEIN_ nested pcr reaction with estimated sizes of and base pairs . cloning and sequencing of these pcr products allowed cap sites of _PROTEIN_ to be mapped to and nt upstream of the first in frame aug start codon in the _PROTEIN_ gene . no transcript start sites were mapped downstream of . whilst the rlm _PROTEIN_ assay identifies authentic transcription start sites it does not provide any quantitative measure of the efficiency at which the alternative sites are used . an _PROTEIN_ was performed to determine relative transcription start site usage . a nt cdna representing nt of the utr and extending nt into the first exon of the _PROTEIN_ gene was used as a template for in vitro transcription to produce a labelled antisense rna probe of nt in length . two distinct protected bands of and nt plus a third very faint band at nt were seen when this probe was used in an _PROTEIN_ with an enriched polyadenylated rna preparation isolated from above ground structures of young arabidopsis plants . these correspond to the cap sites detected by rlm _PROTEIN_ at and nt upstream of the first in frame aug start codon in _PROTEIN_ . collectively these findings demonstrate the presence of up to three _PROTEIN_ transcripts that differ only in the length of the untranslated region upstream of a common orf containing three in frame putative aug translation initiation codons . from the _PROTEIN_ it is possible to estimate the relative contribution of each of the three _PROTEIN_ transcripts to the _PROTEIN_ mrna pool . the predominant _PROTEIN_ transcript comprises at least of the _PROTEIN_ transcript pool and this transcript has the shortest leader sequence preceding . a minor transcript with a utr of nt makes up approximately of the _PROTEIN_ mrna pool while the third transcript which has a utr of nt is barely detectable and is estimated to represent < of the _PROTEIN_ mrna pool . confocal laser scanning microscopy _PROTEIN_ was employed to investigate whether _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion proteins could be targeted in planta to the _LOCATION_ mitochondria or chloroplast . the cdna construct used represented the n terminal amino acid residues of _PROTEIN_ and contained each of the three putative aug initiation codons and and an n terminal amphipathic region characteristic of mitochondrial targeting sequences . significantly this sequence might also possess dual targeting properties capable of targeting proteins to both mitochondria and chloroplasts through non specific interaction with the organellar import machinery . the cdna construct also contained a bipartite nls spanning codons and was cloned in frame with _METHOD_ and placed under the control of the camv promoter . this construct _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was then used to transform wild type arabidopsis thaliana . direct imaging using _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ isoform synthesized from the wt _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transcript in stably transformed arabidopsis plants showed targeting of the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ present in planta to the _LOCATION_ of all cell types imaged including leaves and _METHOD_ and root tip cells . however there was no evidence of targeting of any wt _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ translated from this construct to chloroplasts in stem tissue or guard cells or leaf epidermal cells . these studies show that the single nls contained within the n terminal sequence of the wt _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein is functional in planta and capable of interacting with the _LOCATION_ import machinery of the plant cell to direct the import of the fusion protein into the _LOCATION_ in all arabidopsis tissues studied . in contrast the n terminal putative ambiguous targeting sequence in the wt _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein appears to be incapable of interacting effectively with the chloroplast import machinery of the plant cell to target this fusion protein to chloroplasts in planta in any of these tissues . one mechanism by which variability can be introduced into the n terminus of a polypeptide encoded by a single gene is alternative translation initiation from two or more in frame translation initiation sites present in the transcript . the synthesis of protein _METHOD_ either with or without n terminal intracellular targeting signals can thus be controlled through choice of the start codons used in translation of the mrna orf . whether such translational control _METHOD_ were operative in the synthesis of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ from the _PROTEIN_ mrna transcripts in arabidopsis was investigated . cdnas representing _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion constructs in which only one of the three possible putative translation initiation codons was present were produced by mutagenesis of wt _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . any aug start codon in the wild type construct upstream of the start codon to be retained in the mutagenized construct was mutated to a uag stop codon whilst any putative start codon downstream of the single start codon to be retained was mutated to a gcg codon . the resulting constructs were termed _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ where and indicate the sole retained intact putative aug start codon in the construct . each construct was then used to stably transform wild type arabidopsis thaliana . confocal imaging of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein _PROTEIN_ from wild type and mutagenized constructs in root tip cells of stably transformed arabidopsis plants showed that wt _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ is targeted to both the _LOCATION_ and mitochondria of these cells . however in plants transformed with the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ construct where translation is initiated only from the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ isoform synthesized is targeted only to the mitochondria and there is no detectable _METHOD_ _METHOD_ from the _LOCATION_ . in contrast plants transformed with either the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ constructs which lack a functional exhibit _METHOD_ _METHOD_ only from the _LOCATION_ with mitochondrial localization of any _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein abolished . interestingly the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein contains both an n terminal amphipathic mitochondrial targeting sequence and the bipartite nls yet this isoform is only targeted to the mitochondria and not to the _LOCATION_ in planta . this result is indicative of a hierarchical dominance of the mitochondrial presequence over the nls in intracellular targeting when both signal sequences are present in the same _PROTEIN_ protein in planta . the _LOCATION_ and mitochondrial _METHOD_ of dna ligase in arabidopsis are translated from a single mrna species using the first and second in frame aug codons probably by a leaky ribosomal scanning mechanism . how such a mechanism is controlled is unknown although flanking sequences and rna secondary structure around the start site have been shown to modulate the efficiency with which an aug codon is recognized as the translation start signal in the maize lc transcriptional activator mrna . in order to quantify the effect of nucleotide context in the vicinities of both and start codons on _PROTEIN_ translation initiation and isoform production we performed site directed mutagenesis creating more or less favourable contexts around each start codon in turn and measured the effects of these mutations on translation of _PROTEIN_ from each start codon . specifically we produced _PROTEIN_ cdna constructs in which the to base sequence around was mutated to be identical to that around and there was a reciprocal change so that the to base sequence around resembled the wild type sequence whilst the to sequence around resembled the wild type sequence . native and mutagenized _PROTEIN_ constructs were _PROTEIN_ individually in a coupled transcription translation in vitro cell free system in the presence of methionine to radioactively label in vitro translated _PROTEIN_ . the relative intensity of labelling of the primary unprocessed translation products from and using the mutagenized constructs were compared to their intensities using the wt _PROTEIN_ construct to allow us to quantify any effect of nucleotide context round each start codon on translation initiation efficiency at and . with wt _PROTEIN_ transcripts translation initiation occurs equally well at and demonstrating that around of the small ribosomal subunits traversing the _PROTEIN_ transcript fail to recognize and therefore scan past the first aug codon to initiate translation at . this leaky scanning ensures the production of both the mitochondrial and _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ of _PROTEIN_ in roughly equal amounts in the in vitro system . the presence of a theoretically stronger context around in _PROTEIN_ transcripts has a significant stimulatory effect on translation initiation at this first aug codon compared to . translation initiation from the first aug codon when present in an context now occurs twice as frequently as from the second aug codon indicative of a much reduced level of leaky scanning by small ribosomal subunits as they traverse this _PROTEIN_ transcript . reciprocal exchange of the contexts around and in the _PROTEIN_ construct produced no further changes in translation initiation efficiencies compared to the construct in which only the context had been changed to that of . translation initiation at a choice of start sites can be influenced by the sequence or structural features of the utr of the mrna transcript . we have investigated whether variation in the length of the utr preceding the first initiation codon in _PROTEIN_ could affect translation from and . there was no significant difference in the relative rates of translation initiation from and on _PROTEIN_ transcripts with utr lengths up to nt . increasing the length of the utr to nt i.e . to the length of the utr of the only other _PROTEIN_ mrna species that has significant representation in the _PROTEIN_ mrna pool has no significant effect on the rate of translation from . however translation from on this construct occurred at a reduced level _PROTEIN_ . translation from and on constructs representing the least abundant _PROTEIN_ transcript which constitutes < of the cellular _PROTEIN_ mrna pool is indistinguishable from the pattern of translation on the nt utr _PROTEIN_ transcript . this _PROTEIN_ in translation initiation from occurs as the length of the utr increases from up to approximately nt but there is no additional change in relative usage of and as the length of the utr increases further up to nt .
