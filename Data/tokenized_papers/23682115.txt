arabidopsis thaliana _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ a member of the plant small _PROTEIN_ functioning in the _LOCATION_ transport pathway localizes to pre _LOCATION_ compartments known as multivesicular bodies in plant cells . overexpression of the constitutively active _PROTEIN_ bound mutant of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ induces the formation of large _PROTEIN_ like structures . to better understand the biology of these _PROTEIN_ induced _PROTEIN_ like structures transgenic arabidopsis cell lines _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ tagged with green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ under the control of a heat shock inducible promoter were generated . in these transgenic cells robust _PROTEIN_ like structures were formed after h of heat shock induction . transient co _PROTEIN_ confocal imaging and immunogold electron microscopy experiments demonstrated that these _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ labelled _PROTEIN_ like structures were distinct from the _LOCATION_ apparatus and trans _LOCATION_ network but were labelled with an antibody against an mvb marker protein . in addition live cell imaging and detailed em analysis showed that the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ induced spherical structures originated from the homotypic fusion of mvbs . in summary it was demonstrated that _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is an efficient tool for studying pvc/mvb mediated protein trafficking and _LOCATION_ degradation in plant cells .
to determine the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis cells _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ or _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was transiently _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis protoplasts derived from suspension cultured _PROTEIN_ cells . as shown in _METHOD_ tagged wt _PROTEIN_ labelled punctate structures whereas the constitutively active mutant _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ localized to _PROTEIN_ like structures . to investigate the _LOCATION_ nature of these _PROTEIN_ like structures _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was transiently co _PROTEIN_ with the _METHOD_ tagged mvb marker _PROTEIN_ the tgn marker _PROTEIN_ or the _LOCATION_ marker mani in arabidopsis protoplasts . as shown in only _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ co localized with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ on the _LOCATION_ of enlarged spheres which supports the mvb derived nature of these _PROTEIN_ like structures . in contrast there was no co localization between _METHOD_ labelled _PROTEIN_ like structures and either _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ or _METHOD_ manl indicating that neither tgn nor _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ contribute to the enlarged spheres . _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ induced _PROTEIN_ like structures co localize with an mvb marker but not with tgn or _LOCATION_ markers in arabidopsis protoplasts . the _METHOD_ fusion construct _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ or the _PROTEIN_ bound mutant _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ were transiently _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis protoplasts followed by confocal imaging . _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was transiently co _PROTEIN_ with the _METHOD_ tagged mvb marker _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ the tgn marker _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ or the _LOCATION_ marker mani _METHOD_ in arabidopsis protoplasts followed by confocal imaging . enlarged images of selected areas are also shown . scale bar . to investigate the nature of these _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ induced _PROTEIN_ like structures further transgenic arabidopsis cell lines stably _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ under the control of a _PROTEIN_ were generated via a. tumefaciens mediated transformation . to induce _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion protein _PROTEIN_ transgenic cells were subjected to a brief heat shock treatment at for h and then immediately incubated at for an additional h before analysis of the _METHOD_ signals . to confirm the involvement of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in the formation of these _PROTEIN_ like structures time course experiments were performed by confocal imaging and western blot analysis . as shown in no _METHOD_ signal was detected by confocal microscopy before heat shock treatment . however _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ signals were detected in transgenic cells exposed to heat shock after a h incubation . in addition the number of _METHOD_ positive _PROTEIN_ like structures increased significantly after h and most signals were visible at the tonoplast after h. consistent results were also obtained by western blot analysis with an anti _METHOD_ antibody . a band corresponding to the _METHOD_ fusion protein was first detected h after heat shock treatment . the anti _METHOD_ antibody did not recognize epitopes in wt or transgenic cells without heat shock treatment . an anti tubulin antibody was used as an internal control to ensure equal loading of proteins . analysis of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and localization in transgenic arabidopsis cells . transgenic _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ cells were subjected to heat shock treatment for different durations as indicated followed by either confocal microscopy or western blot analysis using anti _METHOD_ or anti tubulin antibodies . transgenic arabidopsis cells without heat shock treatment were used as the corresponding control . scale bar . taken together these results demonstrate that _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in transgenic cells is controlled by heat shock treatment which induces the formation of _METHOD_ labelled _PROTEIN_ like structures . it should be noted that a h incubation was used for all subsequent experiments because the localization of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ to enlarged spheres was highest at this time point . to study the events leading up to the formation of these _PROTEIN_ like structures transgenic cells _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ were subjected to heat shock treatment followed by time lapse collection of _METHOD_ signals by spinning disc confocal microscopy . _METHOD_ signals were visible as small but highly mobile punctate structures that fused to create larger _PROTEIN_ like structures . multiple fusion events were observed such as those between two enlarged _PROTEIN_ like structures a punctate and a _PROTEIN_ like structure and two _LOCATION_ like structures . these results indicate that the larger _PROTEIN_ like structures are derived largely from the active fusion of smaller _METHOD_ positive structures and that _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ is likely to accumulate on the tonoplast and to promote _LOCATION_ fusion . _LOCATION_ fusion of two enlarged _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ labelled _PROTEIN_ like structures in transgenic arabidopsis cells . time lapse images of transgenic cells _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ were collected by confocal microscopy . arrows point to the fusion of two enlarged _PROTEIN_ like structures . scale bar . to elucidate further the _LOCATION_ source of these enlarged mvbs in transgenic arabidopsis cell lines _METHOD_ was performed using anti vsr anti _PROTEIN_ anti mani _LOCATION_ and anti vppase antibodies . as shown in vsr co localized with the _METHOD_ signal on the limiting _LOCATION_ of _PROTEIN_ like structures but was distinct from _PROTEIN_ and mani . in addition vppase co localized with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ on _PROTEIN_ like structures . in wt or transgenic cells without heat shock treatment the anti vsr antibody labelled punctate pvc structures . these results indicate that heat shock treatment itself does not affect the distribution of vsrs or the morphology of mvbs and that untreated transgenic _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ cells are physiologically similar to wt cells . taken together the _METHOD_ results obtained using the transgenic cell lines are identical to those obtained using arabidopsis protoplasts . _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ co localizes with vsr and vppase on _PROTEIN_ like structures but not with tgn or _LOCATION_ markers in transgenic arabidopsis cells . transgenic _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ cells were subjected to heat shock treatment followed by chemical fixation immunostaining with different antibodies _PROTEIN_ and confocal imaging . enlarged images of selected areas are also shown . scale bar . to investigate further the localization of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ immunogold em experiments were performed . first transgenic _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ arabidopsis cells were either subjected to _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ or not subjected to _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ a brief heat shock treatment which was then followed by hpf ultrathin sectioning and immunogold labelling using an anti vsr antibody . as shown in the vsr antibody specifically labelled mvbs with a diameter of nm in transgenic cells without heat shock treatment . on the other hand the limiting _LOCATION_ of clustered and enlarged mvbs with a diameter > nm in transgenic cells was immunoreactive for vsr upon heat shock treatment . to conclude the immunogold em experiments confirmed that the _PROTEIN_ induced _PROTEIN_ like structures in transgenic cells were mvbs . immunogold em analysis _METHOD_ vsr labelling of enlarged _PROTEIN_ like structures . transgenic _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ arabidopsis cells were subjected to heat shock treatment followed by hpf and immunolabelling with an anti vsr antibody . transgenic arabidopsis cells without heat shock treatment were used as the corresponding control . vsr labelled normal mvbs in untreated cells and vsr labelled enlarged mvbs in treated cells are shown . arrows point to immunoreactive gold particles . scale bar nm . to gain additional insight into the formation of _PROTEIN_ induced enlarged mvbs ultrastructural analysis was performed using transmission electron microscopy . as shown in supplementary fig . at jxb online transgenic cells without heat shock treatment contained one large central _LOCATION_ . however upon heat shock treatment many enlarged mvbs or small _LOCATION_ with different diameters were observed in transgenic cells . in both chemically fixed and hpf samples the cells without _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ contained normal mvbs with a diameter nm . in contrast the morphology and size of the mvbs in _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ cells were very different . as shown in in the cells treated with heat shock lots of mvbs were usually found to accumulate as clusters and become fused . furthermore many enlarged mvbs ranging from nm to in diameter with typical internal vesicles were readily observed in the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ cells . in addition examples of extremely enlarged mvbs in diameter but containing very few internal vesicles were also observed . statistical analyses showed the average diameter of enlarged mvbs in _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ cells to be approximately three times greater than that in _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ cells while the number of internal vesicles was at least times less than those in untreated cells . effects of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ on mvb size and internal vesicle number . significant differences between heat shock treated and untreated groups were analysed using a two tailed t test . data were collected and analysed from three independent experiments . tem analysis of clusters of mvbs in transgenic arabidopsis cells _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . transgenic _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ arabidopsis cells were subjected to heat shock treatment followed by chemical fixation or hpf and subsequent tem analysis . transgenic arabidopsis cells without heat shock treatment were used as the corresponding control . clustered mvbs are shown . arrow points to fusion between two mvbs . scale bar nm . ultrastructure of enlarged mvbs in transgenic arabidopsis cells _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . transgenic _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ arabidopsis cells were subjected to heat shock treatment followed by chemical fixation or hpf and subsequent tem analysis . transgenic arabidopsis cells without heat shock treatment were used as the corresponding control . enlarged mvbs ranging from nm to in diameter with typical internal vesicles are shown . scale bar nm . ultrastructure of extremely enlarged structures with few internal vesicles in transgenic arabidopsis cells following _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . transgenic _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ arabidopsis cells were subjected to heat shock treatment followed by chemical fixation and subsequent tem analysis . transgenic arabidopsis cells without heat shock treatment were used as the corresponding control . enlarged mvbs with a diameter > with few internal vesicles are shown . scale bar nm . in conclusion both live cell imaging and ultrastructural analyses provided substantial evidence demonstrating that _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ induced _PROTEIN_ like structures were derived from an overabundance of homotypic fusion of mvbs . since _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ induced the formation of enlarged mvbs proteins either on the _LOCATION_ or within the lumen of the enlarged mvbs could be easily distinguished under light microscopy . thus when _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ was used in the co _PROTEIN_ experiments the subcellular localization and fate of _METHOD_ tagged proteins in the mvbs could be determined thereby defining mvb mediated protein recycling or degradation in plant cells . indeed as proof of principle _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was transiently co _PROTEIN_ with different _METHOD_ tagged marker proteins in arabidopsis protoplasts . aleurain _METHOD_ is a soluble _LOCATION_ cargo reporter . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ is a _LOCATION_ protein destined for mvb mediated _LOCATION_ degradation whereas _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ and _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ are components of the snare complex which mediate fusion between the pvc and the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . finally _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ was used as a marker of the tonoplast . as shown in aleurain _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were trapped within the lumen of enlarged mvbs for further _LOCATION_ targeting and degradation while _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were localized to the limiting _LOCATION_ of enlarged mvbs but not internalized into the lumen of mvbs . thus enlarged mvbs allow not only the study of mvb mediated protein trafficking but also determination of the fate of a given protein based on its distinct localization on the limiting _LOCATION_ or within the lumen of enlarged mvbs . different distribution of degradative and functional proteins on _PROTEIN_ induced enlarged mvbs . _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was transiently co _PROTEIN_ with aleurain _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in arabidopsis protoplasts followed by confocal imaging . note that the degradative cargo proteins were trapped within the lumen of enlarged mvbs induced by _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ overexpression whereas the pvc/tonoplast localized functional proteins co localized with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ on the limiting _LOCATION_ of enlarged mvbs . enlarged images of selected areas are also shown . scale bar . since wortmannin induces pvc/mvb enlargement in plant cells its effects were compared with those of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ on mvbs . as described above _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was transiently co _PROTEIN_ with the same protein markers _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ into arabidopsis protoplasts followed by wortmannin treatment and confocal imaging . as shown in supplementary fig . at jxb online aleurain _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were trapped within the lumens of enlarged mvbs similar to the effects of _PROTEIN_ while _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ remained on the limiting _LOCATION_ . taken together _PROTEIN_ can mimic the effects of wortmannin to induce formation of enlarged mvbs which can then be used to distinguish the subcellular distribution and fate of different proteins on mvbs in plant cells .
