abscisic acid is one of the most important phytohormones involved in abiotic stress responses seed maturation germination and senescence . aba is predominantly produced in vascular tissues and exerts hormonal responses in various cells including guard cells . although aba responses require extrusion of aba from aba producing cells in an intercellular aba signaling pathway the transport _METHOD_ of aba through the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ remain unknown . here we isolated an _PROTEIN_ binding cassette transporter gene _PROTEIN_ from arabidopsis by genetically screening for aba sensitivity . _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in vascular tissues . the _METHOD_ protein fused _PROTEIN_ was localized at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ in plant cells . in _LOCATION_ vesicles derived from _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ insect cells _PROTEIN_ exhibited _PROTEIN_ dependent aba transport . the _PROTEIN_ overexpressing plants showed higher leaf temperatures implying an influence on stomatal regulation . these results strongly suggest that _PROTEIN_ is an exporter of aba and is involved in the intercellular aba signaling pathway . the presence of the aba transport mechanism sheds light on the active control of multicellular aba responses to environmental stresses among plant cells .
to obtain novel mutants related to aba responses we selected aba related mutants from our transposon tagged mutant collection . we previously constructed about transposon tagged lines in arabidopsis by using the activator /dissociation system and determined the sequence flanking the ds element in all independent lines . using this resource we have been selecting homozygous insertion lines in which the ds transposon is inserted in coding regions of genes for systematic phenotyping analyses . we used high throughput screening with well multititer plates to screen about homozygous mutant lines for aba related phenotypes and isolated one mutant line with an aba sensitive phenotype in the germination and seedling stages . according to the genomic sequences flanking the ds insertion in the isolated line the ds element was in the second intron of a predicted open reading frame of the _GENE_ gene . the _GENE_ gene encodes _PROTEIN_ which is a member of the abcg subfamily of putative abc transporters in the arabidopsis genome . therefore this mutant was designated as _PROTEIN_ . the allelic mutant line designated _PROTEIN_ had a ds insertion in the third exon of _PROTEIN_ and showed the same phenotype as _PROTEIN_ in the multititer plate assay . two additional alleles from t dna insertion lines also showed aba sensitive phenotypes suggesting that the mutation of _PROTEIN_ corresponds to the aba sensitive phenotype . reverse transcriptase mediated pcr analysis showed that the homozygous line of _PROTEIN_ contained no detectable amount of transcripts indicating that this mutant is a transcriptional knockout . although _PROTEIN_ was also a knockout mutant it showed a very faint band from rt pcr probably because the insertional mutation was in a relatively long intron . all of the _PROTEIN_ mutants displayed aba sensitive phenotypes during the early growth stage . to investigate the gene _PROTEIN_ patterns of _PROTEIN_ in wild type tissues we performed semiquantitative rt pcr . total rna was extracted from seedlings roots _METHOD_ leaves flowers and fruits of wild type plants . transcripts for _PROTEIN_ were amplified from the rna of every tissue . for further analysis of tissue specific _PROTEIN_ kb of the _PROTEIN_ promoter region was used to drive _PROTEIN_ of the gus reporter . in gus transgenic plants the gus activity of the transformants was _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in the hypocotyls roots and vascular veins of leaves . to check the aba inducibility of _PROTEIN_ gus transgenic plants were treated with aba solution before gus staining . the _PROTEIN_ levels of the gus reporter in the transformants increased with aba treatment . additionally we stained _PROTEIN_ mutants which contained the gus reporter gene in the ds element as an enhancer trap system . gus signals in _PROTEIN_ were also observed in vascular tissues and were detected along the vascular bundles in the center of roots . by cross sectioning the stained leaves we determined that the signals were accumulated in an area close to the vascular veins . interestingly enzymes that biosynthesize aba are _PROTEIN_ in vascular parenchyma cells and gene _PROTEIN_ is increased under stress conditions in arabidopsis . these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ plays an important role in aba responses at the site of its biosynthesis . to study the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ we made a construct that produced yellow _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ fused to _PROTEIN_ protein under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus promoter . the _PROTEIN_ orf was placed downstream of _METHOD_ . the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ recombinant gene was transiently _PROTEIN_ in onion epidermal cells by particle bombardment . subcellular localization of the fusion protein was visualized by confocal imaging of the yellow _METHOD_ signals in the onion cells . the yellow _METHOD_ of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ recombinant protein was present around the cell surface and outside of the _LOCATION_ in these cells . next the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ recombinant vector was transformed into arabidopsis wild type plants and _METHOD_ signals were observed on the cell surface of root tips in transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . as root tip cells do not contain a large central _LOCATION_ the yellow _METHOD_ reflects _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ localization in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ but not in the tonoplast or cytoplasm . to exclude the possibility of cell wall association of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ the root tip cells were observed after plasmolysis under highly osmotic conditions . after plasmolysis the _METHOD_ in the root tip cells was internalized apart from the cell wall . these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ is a _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ localized protein . to pursue the possibility that _PROTEIN_ can transport aba through the cellular _LOCATION_ we performed a vesicle transport assay . vesicle _LOCATION_ were generated from insect cells transfected with the virus vector integrated with _PROTEIN_ cdna . the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ was confirmed by western blotting using anti _PROTEIN_ antibodies . the efflux activity in plant cells can be detected as aba uptake of the regenerated _LOCATION_ vesicles upon the addition of exogenous _PROTEIN_ because the regenerated _LOCATION_ includes inside out vesicles . the uptake of isotope labeled aba into the vesicles was significantly facilitated by exogenous _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ dependent uptake of aba exhibited saturation kinetics with apparent km and vmax values of nm and protein respectively . in contrast neither adp nor amp facilitated uptake . furthermore adp inhibited _PROTEIN_ dependent aba uptake whereas amp did not show an inhibitory effect . vanadate an effective inhibitor of abc transporters also inhibited the _PROTEIN_ dependent aba uptake . to evaluate substrate specificity cis inhibition was examined . the _PROTEIN_ dependent aba uptake was sensitive to a fold concentration of aba whereas a fold concentration of aba was not effective . other plant hormones such as gibberellic acid and indoleacetic acid did not inhibit the _PROTEIN_ dependent aba uptake . these results indicate that _PROTEIN_ is responsible for aba uptake with a preference for aba rather than aba . to ascertain whether _PROTEIN_ is a flux _PROTEIN_ in aba transport we generated transgenic arabidopsis plants possessing the _PROTEIN_ construct and examined the effect of _PROTEIN_ overexpression on aba signaling . to examine aba responsiveness seeds from the resultant transgenic lines were tested for aba inhibition of postgerminative growth . the ratio of the aba inhibition of postgerminative growth was significantly reduced in three independent transgenic lines _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ transgene supporting the conjecture that _PROTEIN_ functions as a putative efflux _PROTEIN_ of aba . aba acts directly on guard cells and induces stomatal closure . thus we investigated the aerial phenotypes related to stomatal regulation in _PROTEIN_ overexpressing plants . the leaf temperature of transgenic plants was higher than that of wild type plants suggesting less transpiration from the leaves of _PROTEIN_ overexpressing plants . water loss from detached leaves of the transgenic plants was also slower than that from detached wild type leaves . these results are consistent with the idea that _PROTEIN_ is an aba exporter which delivers aba to guard cells . it is possible that aba is accumulated in the apoplastic area around guard cells in _PROTEIN_ overexpressing plants . we originally isolated _PROTEIN_ mutants by screening for aba sensitivity and found that _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in vascular tissues which is the _PROTEIN_ area in which aba is biosynthesized in plants . furthermore the _METHOD_ protein fused _PROTEIN_ protein was subcellularly localized to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ in plant cells . biochemical analyses indicated that _PROTEIN_ has the capability of transporting aba molecules . additionally _PROTEIN_ overexpressing plants had a higher leaf temperature and slower rate of water loss from detached leaves implying that overexpression of _PROTEIN_ may concentrate aba in guard cells and enhance stomatal closure . taken together these results demonstrate that _PROTEIN_ is a functional _PROTEIN_ in the aba transport mechanism and probably facilitates the export of aba from plant cells . thus _PROTEIN_ mutants were aba hypersensitive under aba treatment because the mutants could not remove excess aba from the cells . on the other hand _PROTEIN_ overexpressing plants were resistant to exogenous aba . in contrast to _PROTEIN_ overexpressing plants _PROTEIN_ knockout mutant lines exhibited no aerial phenotypes . we propose that arabidopsis has another _PROTEIN_ with a redundant function for _PROTEIN_ . in addition to the functional redundancy the combined actions of _PROTEIN_ and another half molecule abc transporter would be of particular interest because half molecule abc transporters can work as dimer complexes . our results demonstrate that _PROTEIN_ is a transporter functioning in aba transport in arabidopsis and that an aba transport mechanism exists in plant cells . the identification of _PROTEIN_ provides a clue to understanding the aba transport system in plants and gives insight into the intercellular regulation of aba transport in aba regulatory networks .
