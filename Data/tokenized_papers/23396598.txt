among the three primary auxin induced gene families auxin/indole acetic acid gretchen and small auxin up rna the function of saur genes remains unclear . arabidopsis saur genes have been phylogenetically classified into three clades . recent work has suggested that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ promote cell expansion through the modulation of auxin transport . herein we present our work on _PROTEIN_ a clade iii saur gene with a distinctive _PROTEIN_ pattern in root _METHOD_ . _PROTEIN_ was normally _PROTEIN_ in the quiescent center and cortex/endodermis initials upon auxin stimulation the _PROTEIN_ was provoked in the endodermal layer . during _PROTEIN_ root development _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ in prospective stem cell niches of _PROTEIN_ root primordia and in expanding endodermal cells surrounding the primordia . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ fusion proteins localized to the cytoplasm . overexpression of _PROTEIN_ from the cauliflower mosaic virus promoter led to pleiotropic auxin related phenotypes including long hypocotyls increased vegetative _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ root development expanded _PROTEIN_ and twisted inflorescence _METHOD_ . ectopic _PROTEIN_ proteins were able to promote auxin transport in hypocotyls . tissue specific _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ from the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ promoters induced the formation of new auxin accumulation/signaling peaks above the quiescent centers whereas tissue specific _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ from the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ promoters enhanced root gravitropic growth . cells in the root stem cell niches of these transgenic seedlings were differentially enlarged . the distinctive _PROTEIN_ pattern of the _PROTEIN_ gene and the explicit function of _PROTEIN_ proteins implied that further investigations on the loss of function phenotypes of this gene in root development and environmental responses are of great interest .
previously to counteract possible position effects in plant promoter analysis we used the gypsy su system of drosophila in a novel approach that facilitated high and precise _PROTEIN_ of reporter genes . using this system together with the _PROTEIN_ recombination approach we generated sets of promoter reporter lines for the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ gene family encoding auxin carriers and the _PROTEIN_ gene family encoding auxin receptors . we extended this system to promoter analysis of certain saur genes and found that the _PROTEIN_ gene showed a distinctive _PROTEIN_ pattern in root _METHOD_ . in generating promoter reporter lines for _PROTEIN_ an bp dna fragment upstream of the _PROTEIN_ start codon of _PROTEIN_ as predicted by atcisdb was fused with the _METHOD_ gus reporter gene . viewed by confocal microscopy _PROTEIN_ was found to be specifically _PROTEIN_ in the quiescent center and cortex/endodermis initials of root stem niches . considering that saur genes had been proposed to function in auxin mediated growth events we examined the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ under gravitropic stimulation and auxin treatment . gravitropism allows plant roots to grow directionally whereas auxin is an essential regulator in this process . during the gravitropic response the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ was provoked on both sides of the endodermis at the proximal meristem region and on the upper side of the endodermis at the distal elongation zone indicating that this gene might act to coordinate root elongation rather than simply respond to auxin redistribution . _PROTEIN_ was specifically induced in the endodermis with h of auxin treatment . since the endodermis was recently reported as the primary responsive tissure for gibberellins to coordinate root growth we then tested whether or not _PROTEIN_ was a gibberellin responsive gene . as shown in fig . _PROTEIN_ was unresponsive to gibberellin treatment . this result was in agreement with the results of a microarray experiment . extending the duration of auxin treatment to h and using detection by overnight histochemical staining _PROTEIN_ was found to be induced in multiple cell layers at the root meristem and transition zone . however in the elongation zone it was specifically induced in the endodermal cells . during _PROTEIN_ root development _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ in the prospective quiescent center of _PROTEIN_ root primordia . interestingly _PROTEIN_ was also specifically _PROTEIN_ in the endodermal cells surrounding the _PROTEIN_ root primordia during the process of the _PROTEIN_ root primordia breaking through the endodermis . in the newly formed _PROTEIN_ roots _PROTEIN_ was strongly _PROTEIN_ in the quiescent center and initial cells and weakly _PROTEIN_ in the endodermis . in hypocotyls petioles and cotyledons _PROTEIN_ was predominantly _PROTEIN_ in the vascular tissues . to check the subcellular localization of the _PROTEIN_ protein we generated a transgenic construct in which the camv promoter drove a c terminal translational fusion between the full length _PROTEIN_ and the _METHOD_ protein . location of the fusion protein in hypocotyls and root tips of stably transformed arabidopsis plants was examined by confocal microscopy . results showed that the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was identified at the cytoplasm of epidermal and cortical cells in hypocotyls and at the cytoplasm of all types of cells in root tips including quiescent center cells cortex/endodermis initial cells and epidermal cells . to explore potential roles for _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis growth and development we first screened t dna and transposon insertion lines from the arabidopsis biological resource center _PROTEIN_ and the rikagaku kenkyusho bioresource center _PROTEIN_ respectively . the line from the _PROTEIN_ stocks contained a t dna at the promoter region of _PROTEIN_ . however reverse transcription pcr analysis revealed that this insertion did not impair the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ . in three additional lines we failed to identify dna insertions inside the _PROTEIN_ gene . we then used a gain of function approach and generated transgenic arabidopsis plants overexpressing the untagged _PROTEIN_ or myc tagged _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ gene in addition to the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ plants described above . more than independent lines were obtained for each transgenic construct . plants overexpressing untagged _PROTEIN_ had strong phenotypes similar to that of myc tagged _PROTEIN_ . in contrast plants overexpressing _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ had the weakest phenotypes . we chose _PROTEIN_ plants for detailed study . the _PROTEIN_ transgenic lines displayed pleiotropic auxin related phenotypes . light grown seedlings exhibited to fold longer hypocotyls than wild type controls . surprisingly these seedlings also displayed to fold longer primary roots compared with wild type controls . in addition overexpression of _PROTEIN_ increased root waving on vertically oriented agar plates . after d of growth _PROTEIN_ seedlings had a to fold increase in _PROTEIN_ root numbers and a increase in vegetative _METHOD_ as measured by the fresh weight of shoots . adult _PROTEIN_ plants had twisted inflorescence _METHOD_ . furthermore the _PROTEIN_ of transgenic flower organs were overexpanded and defective in opening completely resulting in reduced seed setting in many siliques . to determine if the elongated hypocotyl phenotype induced by ectopic _PROTEIN_ was due to increased cell expansion we measured hypocotyl epidermal cell length in day old seedlings . the change in hypocotyl epidermal cell length was parallel to the change in hypocotyl length . we then directly measured iaa transport in hypocotyls and detected a increase in basipetal iaa transport in hypocotyls of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ myc and _PROTEIN_ seedlings . as _PROTEIN_ had a distinctive _PROTEIN_ pattern in arabidopsis root _METHOD_ and rice and arabidopsis saur proteins have been proposed to modulate auxin transport we next implemented tissue specific _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ from promoters of auxin transporter genes and root meristem patterning genes . to facilitate the examination of auxin signaling and distribution all transgenic plants were generated in a _METHOD_ background . we first _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ from the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ promoters . in arabidopsis roots _PROTEIN_ promoter activity was strong in stele cells and weak in endodermis and the quiescent center . ectopic _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ driven by the _PROTEIN_ promoter led to auxin retention in stele initials transporting auxin resulting in a large auxin accumulation/signaling peak . in addition _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ roots had additional tiers of distal stem cells while wild type roots typically had one tier of distal stem cells . non differentiated distal stem cells below the quiescent center were characterized by the absence of starch grains . finally _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ roots had supernumerary cell layers while wild type roots exhibited distinctive root radial patterns . statistically of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ roots displayed abnormalities in root meristem patterning . _PROTEIN_ promoter activity was detected in the epidermis cortex and _PROTEIN_ root cap . ectopic _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ from the _PROTEIN_ promoter induced expansion of epidermal and cortical cells but the auxin accumulation/signaling pattern appeared normal . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ roots exhibited a root waving phenotype on vertically oriented agar plates and the epidermal and cortical cells in the two sides of the root transition zones were irregularly and asymmetrically elongated . we also _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ from the promoters of root meristem patterning genes . three promoters were chosen _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ encoded a homeodomain transcription _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ encoded an ap type transcription _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ encoded a receptor like kinase . they were three of the major regulators of root stem cell activity . to compare the effects between tissue specific _PROTEIN_ of a saur protein and a stabilized aux/iaa protein we introduced _PROTEIN_ that harbored a site directed mutation in the proline residue of conserved domain ii . as one of aux/iaa genes of arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ was highly auxin inducible and _PROTEIN_ in vascular tissues and auxin accumulation/signaling peaks . _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ in the quiescent center of root stem cell niches . tissue specific _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ from the _PROTEIN_ promoter induced the formation of additional auxin accumulation/signaling peaks in stele initials above the quiescent center . in addition _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ roots had supernumerary cell layers like those observed in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ roots . as expected tissue specific _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ driven by the _PROTEIN_ promoter inhibited auxin accumulation/signaling in the quiescent center . interestingly it also inhibited auxin accumulation/signaling in the stele initials opposite to the effects observed in tissue specific _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ from the _PROTEIN_ promoter . _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ in the root stem cell niche and its surrounding cells including young epidermal cells cortical cells and columella cells . ectopic _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ from the _PROTEIN_ promoter led to the expansion of cells _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . formation of auxin accumulation/signaling peaks in stele initials was visible but not as dramatically as that in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ roots indicating that the balanced _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in the entire root stem cell niche attenuated the effects of ectopic saur proteins on auxin transport compared with the selected _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in the quiescent center by the _PROTEIN_ promoter . on the other hand tissue specific _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ from the _PROTEIN_ promoter had a more remarkable impact on root meristem development compared with that seen in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ roots . as shown in fig . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ roots had two separate auxin accumulation/signaling maxima one in the quiescent center and the other in the young columella cells . _PROTEIN_ was gradiently _PROTEIN_ in root _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ cap cells . tissue specific _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ from the _PROTEIN_ promoter exhibited triple effects as addressed above additional auxin accumulation/signaling peaks in stele initials and supernumerary cell layers in the proximal meristem zone . on the other hand tissue specific _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ from the _PROTEIN_ promoter inhibited auxin accumulation/signaling in the quiescent center promoted auxin accumulation/signaling in stele initials and led to establishment of new auxin accumulation/signaling peaks in the adjacent provascular cells similar to that seen for relocalization of auxin accumulation/signaling peaks upon _PROTEIN_ auxin transport inhibitor treatment . we measured cell areas of stele initial cells quiescent center cells and distal stem cells in root _METHOD_ of transgenic seedlings _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ from promoters of auxin transporter genes and root meristem patterning genes . the results showed that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ roots had a increase in cell areas of stele initial cells and quiescent center cells while _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ roots had enlarged quiescent center cells and distal stem cells . the root gravitropic responses in these transgenic seedlings were also analyzed . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ roots showed delayed gravitropic growth coinciding with their higher auxin accumulation/signaling in young columella cells but lower auxin accumulation/signaling in lrc cells . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ roots had advanced gravitropic growth h after the gravitropic stimulation while _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ roots displayed enhanced gravitropic growth h after the gravitropic stimulation . it has been suggested that auxin transport in the lower side of _PROTEIN_ cap cells and auxin accumulation in the lower side of epidermal and cortical cells were essential for the root gravitropic response . our results were consistent with the _PROTEIN_ pattern of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ promoters . _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ in both _PROTEIN_ cap cells and epidermal and cortical cells while _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ cap cells .
arabidopsis thaliana ecotype columbia and the _METHOD_ background were used as sources of wild type plant materials . promoter reporter lines for the _PROTEIN_ gene family and the _PROTEIN_ gene family have been donated to _PROTEIN_ . seeds were surface sterilized and cultured aseptically on cm petri dishes containing gamborg s medium with sucrose and agar . the plates were _PROTEIN_ at for d and then transferred to a culture room . we used the _PROTEIN_ system for vector construction . entry vectors were created using the topo kits . the pcr primers for construction of entry vectors for the coding region of _PROTEIN_ and for promoter regions of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are listed in supplementary table . _PROTEIN_ was generated by overlapping pcr using the primers given in supplementary table . each entry clone was confirmed by dna sequencing . _PROTEIN_ compatible destination vectors for protein subcellular localization overexpression myc tagging and promoter analysis were used . the lr reaction was conducted to generate different _PROTEIN_ vectors . to facilitate tissue specific gene _PROTEIN_ from various promoters the camv promoter in the overexpression constructs _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was replaced with a ccdb fragment by a method described previously . briefly the ccdb fragment was pcr amplified using as a template with the primers ccdb up and ccdb dn containing an introduced hindiii and spei site respectively . the ccdb fragment was then digested to replace the promoter sequence thus forming new destination vectors for tissue specific _PROTEIN_ . all of the _PROTEIN_ vectors were electroporated into agrobacterium tumefaciens strain . plants were transformed using the vacuum infiltration method . transgenic plants were selected on plates with ml hygromycin or ml kanamycin depending on the selection markers . single locus and homozygous transgenic lines were characterized as we described previously . for histochemical detection of gus activities young seedlings at different developmental stages and different parts from transgenic plants were collected . they were stained at overnight in mm bromo chloro indolyl d _PROTEIN_ acid _PROTEIN_ mm potassium ferricyanide triton x and m sodium phosphate buffer ph with mm edta . samples were washed in ethanol to remove chl . differential interference contrast images were visualized using a microscope with a ccd camera and eclipsenet software . for the localization of _METHOD_ fusion proteins a confocal microscope system _PROTEIN_ was used . without specification day old seedlings were mounted in water . starch grains in columella cells were stained with ki as described previously . iaa transport in hypocotyls was measured as previously described . iaa was a product of american radiolabeled chemicals inc . the radioisotope counts of iaa were detected using a low noise scintillation counter . after incubations for the durations indicated in the text the plates were digitally photographed . root and hypocotyl length was measured using magnified images . _PROTEIN_ root numbers were counted using each seedling as an individual sample . for hormone treatment seedlings were transferred onto a medium containing naa or _PROTEIN_ for or h. for gravitropism assays the protocol of citation was adopted . the mean hypocotyl epidermal cell length and the cell area of root stem cell niches were measured as described by citation . each treatment contained seedlings and was replicated three times . statistical analysis of the data was performed using microsoft excel and student s t test . images were processed using adobe photoshop .
