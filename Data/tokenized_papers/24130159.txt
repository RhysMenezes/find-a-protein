purine nucleotide catabolism is common to most _METHOD_ and involves a guanine deaminase to convert guanine to xanthine in animals invertebrates and _METHOD_ . using metabolomic analysis of mutants we demonstrate that arabidopsis thaliana uses an alternative catabolic route employing a highly specific guanosine deaminase not reported from any organism so far . the enzyme is ubiquitously _PROTEIN_ and deaminates exclusively guanosine and deoxyguanosine but no other aminated purines pyrimidines or pterines . gsda belongs to the cytidine/deoxycytidylate deaminase family of proteins together with a deaminase involved in riboflavin biosynthesis the chloroplastic trna adenosine deaminase arg and a predicted trna specific adenosine deaminase in a. thaliana . gsda is conserved in plants including the moss physcomitrella patens but is absent in the algae and outside the plant kingdom . our data show that xanthosine is exclusively generated through the deamination of guanosine by gsda in a. thaliana excluding other possible sources like the dephosphorylation of xanthosine monophosphate . like the nucleoside hydrolases _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ gsda is located in the _LOCATION_ indicating that gmp catabolism to xanthine proceeds in a mostly _LOCATION_ pathway via guanosine and xanthosine . possible implications for the biosynthetic route of purine alkaloids and ureides in other plants are discussed .
based on the working hypothesis that plants like many other organismal classes might possess a gda we searched the arabidopsis protein database at the arabidopsis information resource using blastp for putative orthologs to gda from e. coli or to the evolutionary unrelated gda from b. subtilis . proteins with significant similarity to gda from e. coli were not found whereas five proteins with similarity to gda from b. subtilis were identified . these are encoded by the loci _GENE_ _GENE_ _GENE_ and _GENE_ _PROTEIN_ . some of these could be excluded as gda candidate loci because they were already functionally characterized the locus _GENE_ was previously shown to code for a deaminase involved in riboflavin biosynthesis and _GENE_ codes for the chloroplastic trna adenosine deaminase arg . the locus _GENE_ encodes an uncharacterized protein that is highly conserved in plants . the a. thaliana protein has identity to a human protein with known crystal structure which by sequence and structure resembles trna specific adenosine . in yeast this enzyme catalyzes the adenosine to inosine editing of the anticodon loop of several trnas and is essential for survival . consistent with this a mutation in the putative a. thaliana ortholog is embryo lethal _PROTEIN_ . we concluded that locus _GENE_ likely codes for in a. thaliana . locus is conserved only in a small group of brassicaceae . whereas in b. rapa and r. raphanistrum this gene is _PROTEIN_ there is no evidence for a transcript from in a. thaliana . additionally the reading frame _METHOD_ truncated in a. thaliana attributable to a base deletion . we conclude that likely represents a pseudogene . the protein encoded at locus _GENE_ possesses the highest overall similarity to gda from b. subtilis . several residues are conserved that are important for substrate interaction deduced from the crystal structure analysis of the b. subtilis enzyme . a cdna for this plant gda candidate was cloned engineering a strepii tag coding sequence to the end . n terminal tagging was chosen because a tyr residue at the c terminus of the enzyme may be important for substrate binding and would be masked by a tag . transient _PROTEIN_ in nicotiana benthamiana and affinity purification resulted in highly purified protein for biochemical analyses . the identity of the protein was confirmed by immunoblot using antiserum raised against the candidate protein . the activity of the enzyme was assessed using a range of nucleotides nucleosides and nucleobases as well as pterines all possessing amino group substitutions on the respective _PROTEIN_ . to our surprise the enzyme deaminated exclusively guanosine at a high rate and showed no or very low activity with all other tested substrates including guanine . further enzymatic assays revealed that deoxyguanosine also is a substrate . we conclude that we identified a gsda . kinetic measurements for both substrates were performed . michaelis menten constants of and and turnover numbers of and were determined for guanosine and deoxyguanosine respectively resulting in catalytic efficiencies of and . a group of compounds was tested as potential inhibitors or activators of the enzyme but none had an influence on the activity . to assess if gsda plays a role in the catabolism of guanosine in vivo two t dna insertion mutants were isolated from the sail and gabi kat collections . in homozygous lines of and _PROTEIN_ gsda specific transcript and gsda protein were absent . growth and development of both mutants resembled the wild type . in seeds of both mutants guanosine accumulated while such accumulation was not observed in the wild type . deoxyguanosine was not detected in the mutants indicating that this compound is of minor significance in vivo . the identity of peaks observed in hplc traces was confirmed by the retention time of corresponding standards diode array spectra of compounds and offline _METHOD_ _METHOD_ of compounds collected during hplc runs . the introduction of transgenes resulting in the _PROTEIN_ of n terminally strepii or yellow _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ tagged gsda into the gsda mutant background prevented guanosine accumulation in seeds . the accumulation of guanosine in gsda mutants was also observed in leaves roots and siliques and increased with plant age . in the wild type guanosine was not detected in any of the investigated tissues . together these data unambiguously link guanosine degradation in vivo to gsda . it was recently reported that mutation of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ of a. thaliana leads to accumulation of xanthosine and uridine in this plant because the enzyme is required for the hydrolysis of both compounds in vivo . we crossed plants carrying the published _PROTEIN_ allele with plants possessing the gsda allele to assess the contribution of gsda to the xanthosine pool in vivo . as previously reported the _PROTEIN_ mutant accumulated xanthosine and uridine in seeds but also in leaves and roots . in the double mutant the accumulation of xanthosine was prevented completely and high guanosine concentrations were observed instead irrespective of tissue . identical results were obtained when a second unpublished _PROTEIN_ allele _PROTEIN_ was crossed with gsda mutants and metabolite profiles of seeds were analyzed . we conclude that the only source of xanthosine in vivo is the deamination of guanosine by gsda . other possible sources like the dephosphorylation of xmp or the oxidation of inosine do not contribute significantly to the xanthosine pool in vivo . furthermore the lack of gsda in the mutant can not be compensated for by any other enzyme although ample guanosine is available as substrate in this genetic background . this demonstrates that the locus which likely represents a pseudogene according to our in silico analysis can indeed not give rise to a functional gsda enzyme . fusion proteins of gsda with _METHOD_ at the n terminus _METHOD_ located to the _LOCATION_ after transient _PROTEIN_ in leaves of n. benthamiana and in a. thaliana protoplasts generated from stable transgenic lines . the stability of the transgene was demonstrated by immunoblot developed with an anti green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ antibody . the tag probably masked any potential n terminal localization peptide but unfortunately all of our attempts to _PROTEIN_ a c terminally tagged gsda fusion protein failed . nonetheless the location of gsda is very likely _LOCATION_ because _METHOD_ gsda is functional in vivo as it prevents the accumulation of guanosine when introduced into the gsda mutant background the enzyme was found in the _LOCATION_ fraction in a proteomic study most in silico tools predict _LOCATION_ location _PROTEIN_ and the downstream enzymes _PROTEIN_ and xanthine dehydrogenase are located in the _LOCATION_ as well . integrating published information and our data we conclude that the reactions of purine catabolism from guanosine to uric acid via xanthosine and xanthine catalyzed by gsda _PROTEIN_ and xanthine dehydrogenase are located in the _LOCATION_ . uric acid is then imported into the _LOCATION_ for further degradation . gsda is ubiquitously _PROTEIN_ in a. thaliana because the protein is detected in all investigated tissues and guanosine accumulates in the respective tissues in the gsda mutant . additionally plant lines carrying a transgene with a bp genomic fragment upstream of the gsda start codon fused to _PROTEIN_ showed ubiquitous blue staining . gsda transcript is well detected in all tissues and cell types according to microarray data _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . we conclude that gsda is ubiquitously _PROTEIN_ in a. thaliana consistent with its role in a primary metabolic pathway . orthologs to gsda are found in each plant genome sequenced to date mostly in single copy but not in the green algae . similarities between plant sequences are high even in taxonomically distant species for example between gsda from a. thaliana and the ortholog from rice encoded at the locus . a sequence comparison of plant gsdas with bacterial gdas reveals that residues required for deamination in the cytidine/deoxycytidylate deaminase superfamily are conserved in both groups and that all residues required for substrate binding deduced from the crystal structure of gda of b. subtilis are conserved between gsdas and gdas with the notable exception of a trp at position in gda which is exchanged for leu in plant gsdas . these sequence hallmarks make it easy to discern gsda from other similar proteins of the cytidine/deoxycytidylate deaminase family encoded in plant genomes . the location of trp in the active site of gda from b. subtilis precludes the binding of guanosine by clashing with the rib moiety . we speculated that the presence of leu instead of trp in gsda might allow the binding of guanosine in the active site . this hypothesis was tested by exchanging leu of gsda from a. thaliana for trp or by altering the whole _PROTEIN_ motif to ywa found in the b. subtilis gda enzyme . the variant enzymes lost enzymatic activity with guanosine but also did not display any activity with guanine . the reverse exchanges in gda of b. subtilis _PROTEIN_ also abolished all enzymatic activity . we conclude that leu and trp have functional relevance for gsda and gda respectively but their exchange alone or within their respective sequence contexts is not sufficient to change substrate specificity of these enzymes . nonetheless when trp is present in a gda/gsda subfamily protein then the respective enzyme will likely catalyze guanine and not guanosine deamination . based on this assumption gsda does not occur outside the plant kingdom because trp is highly conserved in nonplant gda/gsda subfamily proteins . this includes proteins of eukaryotic origin from nematodes and red algae which contain trp and are overall more similar to gda than gsda . these conclusions are backed up by a phylogenetic analysis clearly separating the gda and gsda subfamilies and assigning the c. elegans and g. sulphuraria sequences to the gda group . up to now gda of the cytidine/deoxycytidylate deaminase type has been documented only in prokaryotes .
