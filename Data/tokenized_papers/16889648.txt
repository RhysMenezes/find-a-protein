a number of protein and rna processing mutants have been shown to affect aba sensitivity . a new mutant _PROTEIN_ was isolated from a t dna mutagenized population of _PROTEIN_ luc plants and shown to have increased luminescence after aba salt cold or polyethylene glycol treatments . _PROTEIN_ of several aba and stress responsive genes was higher in the mutant than in the wild type . _PROTEIN_ also exhibited aba hypersensitivity in seed germination and seedling growth . _PROTEIN_ was found to encode an importin domain family protein likely to be involved in _LOCATION_ transport . _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ at a low level in all tissues examined except flowers but _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was not inducible by aba or stress . subcellular localization of _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ showed a predominantly _LOCATION_ localization consistent with a role for _PROTEIN_ in _LOCATION_ transport . knockout of the closest importin homolog of _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis did not duplicate the _PROTEIN_ phenotype indicating that _PROTEIN_ plays a specific role in aba signaling . analysis of _PROTEIN_ luc luminescence and aba and stress sensitivity in double mutants of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ a newly isolated allele of _PROTEIN_ also in the _PROTEIN_ luc background suggested that _PROTEIN_ acts upstream of or has additive effects with these two genes . the results suggest a role for _LOCATION_ transport in aba signal transduction and the possible roles of _PROTEIN_ in relation to that of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are discussed .
_PROTEIN_ was isolated from a t dna mutagenized population of _PROTEIN_ luciferase _PROTEIN_ plants in the _PROTEIN_ background . the t dna construct and mutagenesis procedures are described by citation . approximately t dna lines in pools of were screened for altered luminescence following stress or aba treatment using procedures similar to those described previously for a chemically mutagenized population of _PROTEIN_ luc . a group of mutants that had increased stress or aba responsive _PROTEIN_ luc _PROTEIN_ and aba hypersensitivity in seed germination were isolated . one of these mutants designated as _PROTEIN_ is the focus of this study . _PROTEIN_ had significantly increased _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ luc after cold polyethylene glycol or nacl treatment but not on normal media . _PROTEIN_ luc _PROTEIN_ was also higher in _PROTEIN_ compared with wild type after treatment with exogenous aba . mutants with _PROTEIN_ stress and aba responsive _PROTEIN_ luc _PROTEIN_ were also isolated and one of these mutants was found to be allelic to the aba hypersensitive mutant _PROTEIN_ . this mutant was designated as _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . increased accumulation of luc mrna in _PROTEIN_ after treatment with salt aba cold or peg was observed by rna blot analysis . this _METHOD_ that _PROTEIN_ affects mrna _PROTEIN_ from the _PROTEIN_ promoter rather than the stability of the luc protein . a rna blot analysis also showed that mrna levels of the endogenous _PROTEIN_ gene were higher in _PROTEIN_ than in wild type after treatment with salt osmotic stress or aba . this demonstrates that _PROTEIN_ affects _PROTEIN_ of the endogenous _PROTEIN_ gene in addition to the _PROTEIN_ luc construct . we also examined the _PROTEIN_ of several other stress and aba responsive genes using quantitative real time pcr . the aba responsive gene _PROTEIN_ had increased _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ after treatment with peg nacl or aba . this demonstrated that the effects of _PROTEIN_ were not limited to altered _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . increased _PROTEIN_ of another gene induced by aba and stress _PROTEIN_ was observed only after aba treatment . in contrast _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ was not altered in _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ is a key enzyme in aba synthesis and is likely to be regulated in large part by signals upstream of aba accumulation . this suggests that _PROTEIN_ affects responses downstream of aba accumulation . we also used aba radioimmunoassay to quantify seedling aba content and found no significant difference in aba content between wild type and _PROTEIN_ seedlings under control conditions or after peg treatment . thus we focused further characterization of _PROTEIN_ on its increased sensitivity to aba . _PROTEIN_ was dramatically affected in the sensitivity of seed germination to exogenous aba . low concentrations of aba that had little or no effect on germination of the _PROTEIN_ wild type reduced _PROTEIN_ germination by approximately . increased aba sensitivity was also seen at and aba . _PROTEIN_ was also hypersensitive to aba in post germination seedling growth . ten day old wild type seedlings showed little growth inhibition on media containing exogenous aba . in contrast _PROTEIN_ seedlings had little shoot or root development on aba containing media . we also observed that _PROTEIN_ plants flowered days earlier than wild type . this was the only morphological difference that we observed between _PROTEIN_ and wild type rosette stage plants and mature plants were indistinguishable from wild type . another relevant question is whether _PROTEIN_ is also affected in its response to other hormones . we measured root elongation of wild type and _PROTEIN_ seedlings after transfer to media containing aminocyclopropane _PROTEIN_ acid giberellic acid the cytokinin benzyl adenine indole acetic acid epibrassinosteroid and dichlorophenoxyacetic acid . in all cases the relative effect of the hormone treatment on root elongation was the same in wild type and _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ was also not altered in its response to high levels of sugar _PROTEIN_ . together these data suggest that _PROTEIN_ is specific in its effect on the aba response . a kb genomic dna fragment flanking the t dna left border in _PROTEIN_ was obtained by plasmid rescue and sequence analysis showed that the t dna was inserted in the seventh intron of _GENE_ . reverse transcriptase pcr and rna blot analysis confirmed that the _GENE_ transcript is absent in _PROTEIN_ . to further confirm that the t dna insertion in _GENE_ is the cause of the _PROTEIN_ phenotype we isolated a bp genomic dna fragment containing _GENE_ by restriction digest of bac clone . the fragment included bp upstream of the translation initiation codon and bp downstream of the stop codon . the fragment was cloned into the binary vector and used to transform _PROTEIN_ plants . hygromycin resistant seedlings had wild type sensitivity of seedling growth to aba and _PROTEIN_ luc . in agreement with this _PROTEIN_ luc _PROTEIN_ of the hygromycin resistant seedlings was _PROTEIN_ compared with untransformed _PROTEIN_ after treatment with aba peg nacl or cold . we also isolated homozygous plants of a salk t dna insertion in _PROTEIN_ and found that these plants were also hypersensitive to aba . together these data demonstrated that _GENE_ is _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ is annotated as an importin subunit protein similar to importin in vertebrates and in drosophila melanogaster . citation and citation have conducted extensive phylogenetic analysis of the importin proteins in arabidopsis and showed that _PROTEIN_ is highly related to another importin domain protein encoded by _GENE_ . _PROTEIN_ of this gene was unaffected in _PROTEIN_ . rna blot analysis was performed to determine the tissue distribution and stress inducibility of _PROTEIN_ . low levels of _PROTEIN_ transcripts were detected in roots leaves stem and siliques but not in flowers . no induction of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ by salt cold aba or dehydration treatment was observed . the tissue distribution of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was further examined by isolating a dna fragment from the translational start codon to of _PROTEIN_ fusing it to the gus reporter gene and generating transgenic plants . in agreement with the rna blot results gus _PROTEIN_ was detected in the entire seedling root leaf stem and silique from independent transgenic plants . in leaves gus staining was found in both epidermal cells and guard cells . we investigated the _LOCATION_ localization of _PROTEIN_ by transiently _PROTEIN_ an n terminal fusion of _METHOD_ to _PROTEIN_ in leaf epidermal cells . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was observed mostly in and around the _LOCATION_ with substantial amounts of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ also in the cytoplasm . this is consistent with the expected function of _PROTEIN_ in _LOCATION_ transport although the exact function of _PROTEIN_ is not known . _GENE_ encodes an importin protein that shares the highest sequence homology to _PROTEIN_ out of the importin domain proteins in arabidopsis . because of this extensive homology and because of the possibility that increased aba sensitivity may be a general effect of altered _LOCATION_ transport we investigated whether knockout of _GENE_ can also alter aba sensitivity . homozygous plants of a line containing a t dna insertion in the fourth exon of _GENE_ were isolated by pcr screening . reverse transcriptase pcr analysis showed that _GENE_ is _PROTEIN_ at a low level in col wild type and this _PROTEIN_ was eliminated in the _GENE_ t dna line . seed germination of _GENE_ was less sensitive to aba than that of wild type . note that the col ecotype used in these experiments is itself less sensitive to aba inhibition of seed germination than the _PROTEIN_ background of our _PROTEIN_ mutant . _GENE_ did not substantially differ from wild type however in the effect of aba peg or nacl stress on seedling growth . thus the _GENE_ mutation does not duplicate the _PROTEIN_ phenotype . this suggests that _PROTEIN_ has a relatively strong and specific effect and raises the possibility that _PROTEIN_ could have a role in transport of aba signaling intermediates . from the same population of t dna mutagenized _PROTEIN_ luc we also isolated a t dna insertion in _PROTEIN_ by thermal asymmetric interlaced pcr . this allele was designated _PROTEIN_ and has an insertion in the ninth intron of _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ exhibited enhanced aba sensitivity similar to previous reports but reduced _PROTEIN_ luc _PROTEIN_ . with the isolation of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ we now had a collection of three mutants in the _PROTEIN_ luc background involved in transport or rna metabolism functions that affect aba signaling . to better understand the interaction of these loci we performed double mutant analysis of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ had higher _PROTEIN_ luc _PROTEIN_ than either _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ alone after treatment with aba cold or nacl . the data suggested an additive interaction between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ on _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ . this is consistent with _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ acting in separate branches of stress and aba signaling that converge at the regulation of _PROTEIN_ or with _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ acting on the same signaling branch but having an additive effect on the signaling output . growth of the _PROTEIN_ mutant under unstressed conditions was similar to that of _PROTEIN_ for either soil grown plants or seedlings . in the sensitivity of seedling growth to aba _PROTEIN_ seedlings were more sensitive than _PROTEIN_ alone and of similar sensitivity or slightly more sensitive than _PROTEIN_ alone . seeds of the double mutant did not germinate and grow even after days on aba whereas _PROTEIN_ did germinate and exhibited a low level of seedling growth . likewise when _PROTEIN_ seedlings were subjected to low water potential or nacl stress the double mutant was more sensitive than _PROTEIN_ and of similar sensitivity or slightly more sensitive than _PROTEIN_ . the results suggest an epistatic effect of _PROTEIN_ over _PROTEIN_ on growth and aba response or an additive effect with _PROTEIN_ having the larger effect . _PROTEIN_ had reduced _PROTEIN_ luc _PROTEIN_ compared to wild type after treatment with aba cold or nacl . although the underlying _METHOD_ are not known _PROTEIN_ may have a different role in the regulation of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ than it does in seed germination and stomatal closure where inactivation of _PROTEIN_ causes aba hypersensitivity . _PROTEIN_ also had reduced _PROTEIN_ luc _PROTEIN_ compared with wild type . the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ luc in the double mutant is consistent with _PROTEIN_ acting downstream of _PROTEIN_ . also soil grown plants of _PROTEIN_ were indistinguishable from _PROTEIN_ . like _PROTEIN_ seedling growth of _PROTEIN_ was similar to wild type under unstressed conditions and only slightly more affected by low water potential or nacl . seedling growth of _PROTEIN_ was more sensitive to aba than that of the single mutant and the double mutant was also much more sensitive to low water potential or nacl than either _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ . this last observation in particular suggests that the processes affected by _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ do not completely overlap or that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ both have a limited effect on the same signaling processes and these effects are additive in the double mutant .
the t dna mutagenized population in the _PROTEIN_ luc background _PROTEIN_ has been previously described . this population was screened for altered _PROTEIN_ luc _PROTEIN_ in response to low temperature exogenous aba or salt treatment as described previously . unmutagenized _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ luc is referred to as wild type throughout this study . the t dna line was obtained from the arabidopsis biological resource center _PROTEIN_ and plants homozygous for the t dna insertion obtained by pcr screening . soil grown plants were grown in metro mix in growth chambers with h light at h dark at and relative humidity . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutant plants were backcrossed to wild type and and seedlings tested for aba sensitivity luminescence and bialaphos resistance . to obtain double mutants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were crossed and the resulting progeny were used to identify homozygous double mutant lines . mutant and wild type seeds were surface sterilized plated on murashige and skoog _METHOD_ medium with sucrose and agar and stratified at for days before transfer to under continuous light for germination and growth . for tests of the aba sensitivity of germination and seedling growth seeds were plated directly onto media containing the aba concentrations indicated in the text or figures . for determination of the sensitivity of root elongation to hormone treatment seeds were germinated on hormone free media day old seedlings were transferred to hormone containing media and root elongation was quantified days _PROTEIN_ . hormone treatments tested were epibrassinosteroid gibberelic acid indol acetic acid dichlorophenoxyacetic acid benzyladenine or aminocyclopropane _PROTEIN_ acid . no difference in root elongation between mutant and wild type was observed for any of these treatments . for determination of low water potential or salt sensitivity seedlings were plated directly onto salt containing media or peg infused agar plates _PROTEIN_ and seedling growth observed or days after the end of the stratification period . polyethylene glycol infused plates were prepared as described by citation with the modification that or sucrose was added to the media to be consistent with the other characterization of _PROTEIN_ . for rna blot analysis total rna was extracted from wild type roots leaves _METHOD_ siliques and flowers of arabidopsis or day old wild type and _PROTEIN_ seedlings treated with low temperature aba nacl dehydration or peg . thirty _METHOD_ of rna per lane was used for rna blot analysis . blotting procedures and the luc _PROTEIN_ and actin probes were as previously described . for _PROTEIN_ rna blots the full length cdna was used as the probe . for rt pcr and real time pcr analysis total rna was extracted using a rneasy plant mini kit . first strand cdna was synthesized with or of total rna _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . real time pcr quantification of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was performed essentially as described by citation using a sequence detection system instrument _METHOD_ . quantification of copy number for each gene was done by amplifying a bp portion of each gene containing the binding sites for the real time pcr primers and taq man probe . the amplified dna fragment was purified quantified spectrophotometrically and diluted appropriately to generate a standard curve for calculation of the copy number of each transcript . sequences of the oligonucleotides used for rt pcr and real time pcr analysis are given in table . deoxyribonucleic acid flanking the left border of the inserted t dna in _PROTEIN_ plants was isolated by plasmid rescue using bamhi digested genomic dna . for _PROTEIN_ complementation a bp dna fragment of the _PROTEIN_ gene including bp upstream of the translation initiation codon and bp downstream of the translation stop codon was digested from bac clone using ecori and spei . the _PROTEIN_ gene fragment was cloned into the pcambia vector and transformed into _PROTEIN_ plants using the floral dip method . deoxyribonucleic acid flanking the t dna left border in _PROTEIN_ plants was isolated by thermal asymmetric interlaced pcr as previously described . a _PROTEIN_ gus construct was generated by pcr amplifying a bp fragment of the _PROTEIN_ promoter and cloning into the pcambia vector between the ecori and bamhi sites . after transformation independent transgenic lines were tested for gus activity . tissue was stained by incubating in gus staining buffer overnight at followed by clearing with ethanol . an n terminal fusion of _METHOD_ to _PROTEIN_ was generated and used for transient _PROTEIN_ following the procedures of citation with the modification that leaf epidermal cells were used for _PROTEIN_ . _METHOD_ images were collected on a leica confocal microscope .
