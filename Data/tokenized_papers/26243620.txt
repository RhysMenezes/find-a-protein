elevated _PROTEIN_ dioxide _PROTEIN_ in leaves closes stomatal apertures . research has shown key functions of the _PROTEIN_ anhydrases in rapid _PROTEIN_ induced stomatal movements by catalytic transmission of the _PROTEIN_ signal in guard cells . however the underlying _METHOD_ remain unclear because initial studies indicate that these arabidopsis are targeted to distinct intracellular compartments upon _PROTEIN_ in tobacco cells . which cellular location of these enzymes plays a key role in native guard cells in _PROTEIN_ regulated stomatal movements remains unknown . here we _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ tagged cas in guard cells of double mutant plants and show that the specific locations of at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and in native guard cell chloroplasts each can mediate rapid _PROTEIN_ control of stomatal movements . localization and complementation analyses using a mammalian yellow _METHOD_ protein in guard cells further show that cytoplasmic localization is also sufficient to restore _PROTEIN_ regulation of stomatal conductance . mathematical modeling of cellular _PROTEIN_ catalysis suggests that the dynamics of the intracellular concentration change in guard cells can be driven by _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and cytoplasmic localizations of cas but not as clearly by chloroplast targeting . moreover modeling supports the notion that the intracellular concentration dynamics in guard cells are a key mechanism in mediating _PROTEIN_ regulated stomatal movements but that an additional chloroplast role of cas exists that has yet to be identified .
to characterize the cellular locations of and and gain insight into the sites of _PROTEIN_ responsiveness in guard cells we generated transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fused to the c terminus of or . these constructs were targeted to mature guard cells using the guard cell promoter . analyses of nonguard cells in leaves including epidermal pavement cells and mesophyll cells showed no clear _METHOD_ _METHOD_ for the _METHOD_ fusion lines used for further analyses . confocal microscopy analyses showed that _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ was targeted to the chloroplasts of guard cells but no clear signal was detected in other compartments and locations in guard cells in leaves from more than plants . previous research showed that targeted _PROTEIN_ to chloroplasts upon _PROTEIN_ in tobacco leaves however a fraction of _PROTEIN_ in tobacco leaves was also found at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . to further investigate this difference we _PROTEIN_ different portions of fused to _METHOD_ in tobacco leaves . biochemical studies of pea ca had previously identified cleavage of the chloroplast targeting sequence at two different sites resulting in two different protein lengths . the respective predicted cleavage sites are located before and after a highly charged region of the protein corresponding to amino acid in . we analyzed the protein sequences of _PROTEIN_ in tobacco leaves by western blot and identified a prominent protein band with an apparent mr of kd . additional analysis by tandem _METHOD_ spectroscopy identified peptides starting from approximately amino acid . this indicates cleavage of approximately upstream of amino acid in a highly charged region consisting of seven acidic and five basic residues which was similarly described for pea ca . microscopic analysis of _METHOD_ tagged showed that the n terminus spanning the first amino acids of containing the chloroplast peptide signal was targeted to chloroplasts whereas _PROTEIN_ of a truncated without the first amino acids _PROTEIN_ was localized in the vicinity of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ or cytoplasm . these data suggest that in tobacco plants could be cleaved which results in the partial cytoplasm/plasma _LOCATION_ localization of in this system . _PROTEIN_ in tobacco may thus lead to mistargeting of some of the cleaved protein . we investigated whether the _METHOD_ tagged protein _PROTEIN_ in native guard cell chloroplasts in plants can complement the reduced _PROTEIN_ response phenotype of double mutant plants . gas exchange analyses in three independent transgenic lines showed complementation of the double mutant . in contrast to _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ tagged was detected at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ of guard cells consistent with transient _PROTEIN_ in tobacco cells . the _PROTEIN_ responses of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ transgenic lines were also complemented by the guard cell _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ localized _METHOD_ in three independent lines . interestingly these findings suggest that the _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ fusion constructs are functional although these have distinct cellular sites of activity . these results show that the localization of at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ is sufficient to mediate _PROTEIN_ induced stomatal closing . the above findings show that and localize to different cellular compartments in guard cells but that their _PROTEIN_ regulates _PROTEIN_ induced stomatal movements . we therefore investigated whether mistargeting of to chloroplasts would result in functional _PROTEIN_ regulated stomatal movements in guard cells . for mistargeting to chloroplasts the chloroplast transit peptide comprising the n terminal residues of the _PROTEIN_ localized iron sulfur cluster assembly like protein _PROTEIN_ protein was fused to _METHOD_ and the construct was driven by the guard cell promoter . confocal imaging analyses confirmed that _METHOD_ was _PROTEIN_ in guard cell chloroplasts . three randomly selected independent transgenic _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ lines mistargeting to chloroplasts in the background were chosen for analyses of _PROTEIN_ regulation of stomatal conductance . notably none of the investigated lines exhibited complete wild type _PROTEIN_ responses . an apparent putative average weak recovery of the _PROTEIN_ response was observed in the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ line . however this _PROTEIN_ response was not significant for the first min after _PROTEIN_ was shifted to . previous data showed that a structurally unrelated human without _METHOD_ fusion also restored the stomatal response of to _PROTEIN_ shifts . however the cellular targeting of this unrelated was not resolved . we investigated the cellular targeting and in parallel stomatal _PROTEIN_ responses in plants _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ tagged human . first we transiently _PROTEIN_ the human caii _METHOD_ fusion construct in tobacco epidermal cell protoplasts . _METHOD_ signals were detected in both cytoplasm and the _LOCATION_ region and did not overlap with chlorophyll _METHOD_ of chloroplasts . second the _METHOD_ tagged human was _PROTEIN_ in guard cells using the promoter . the _METHOD_ tagged human was detected in the cytoplasm and _LOCATION_ of guard cells similar to its _PROTEIN_ in tobacco epidermal cells . stomatal conductance changes in response to _PROTEIN_ changes were determined in randomly selected human _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ transgenic lines . notably human _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ also rescued the stomatal responses to _PROTEIN_ changes of mutant plants . these data suggest that the activities of human _METHOD_ fusion proteins in the cytoplasm and _LOCATION_ are sufficient for regulation of stomatal _PROTEIN_ responses . remarkably together all of these findings show that the investigated cas are targeted to distinct cellular sites but retain each one separately the ability to complement the double mutant . to explore the above findings and the potential signaling components in _PROTEIN_ regulation of the stomatal closing pathway we constructed a simplified model for the catalytic activity of cas targeted to different compartments . we developed a compartmental mathematical model using parameters from a recent study on _PROTEIN_ influx into xenopus laevis oocytes which was modified to accommodate the much smaller cell size of guard cells . this model describes the interconversion of _PROTEIN_ and protons . initially we modeled the guard cell as a single compartment with spatially uniform concentration of reactants . this simplification was chosen given the small size of guard cells together with the large diffusion constants of the reactants _PROTEIN_ and . we incorporated ca like activity by multiplying the rate constants and by an acceleration _PROTEIN_ a as described in the work by citation . the starting condition for the simulation was at a _PROTEIN_ concentration of for both the leaf and the intracellular fluid consistent with directly measured ci values in leaves during the light period . a change of ci to similar to leaves exposed to darkness results in an influx of _PROTEIN_ into the cell such that the internal _PROTEIN_ concentration rapidly approaches the external value . the simulated intracellular concentration was plotted as a function of time in the presence and absence of cas . in the presence of cas an acceleration _PROTEIN_ of a was assumed for _PROTEIN_ dissociation in the cell . in the absence of ca activity the predicted increase in the intracellular bicarbonate concentration occurred on a substantially slowed timescale . clearly the presence of cas changes the time course of the predicted bicarbonate concentration increase . because elevated intracellular bicarbonate elevation causes stomatal closure and activates s type anion channels in guard cells the predicted time courses of change correlate with the slowed stomatal response to _PROTEIN_ shifts in mutant plants . note also that the steady state value of the system is independent of the acceleration _PROTEIN_ and thus eventually stomata may be predicted to be close to a similar level in mutant plants albeit at a slower rate . this result can be explained by noting that in a theoretical system that behaves as a closed system to all solutes other than _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ buffering power in the steady state does not depend on the presence of ca . thus the results of our simulations could potentially explain the phenotype of stomatal movements observed in guard cells . to determine the effects of ca localization for driving intracellular bicarbonate concentration changes we have also simulated a small internal compartment representing an organelle such as the chloroplast within a larger compartment that corresponds to the guard cell . the acceleration _PROTEIN_ in the guard cell s _LOCATION_ of mutant plants was taken to be one whereas within the organelle aorg was varied . our simulations revealed that for a chloroplast with an inner envelope _LOCATION_ that does not permit substantial release from the organelle back into the cytoplasm the time course of _LOCATION_ concentration is largely unaffected by the presence of organellar ca . the slight reduction in _LOCATION_ compared with a can be understood by realizing that because of the organellar ca the chloroplast acts as a small sink for _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ resulting in a marginally smaller _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ and thus a slightly slower production of _LOCATION_ . even assuming a chloroplast inner envelope _LOCATION_ that is permeable to all components including flux from the chloroplast into the cytoplasm and choosing aorg resulted in _LOCATION_ dynamics that are considerably slower than those in our single compartment model . however increasing the value of the organellar acceleration _PROTEIN_ aorg is equivalent to choosing a ca with a larger activity in the organelle and will speed up this dynamics . we have verified this through explicit simulations that the predicted time course of can be made similar to the one obtained using a single compartment with a if the organellar ca has a larger activity . these predictions may explain our experimental findings that the mistargeting of to chloroplasts can not complement the insensitive stomatal responses to _PROTEIN_ changes of the mutant whereas at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ the activity is sufficient . furthermore because it _METHOD_ unlikely that the chloroplast _LOCATION_ permits large rates of or efflux from the chloroplast back to the cytoplasm it also suggests that the role of organellar might be more complex than simulated in our simple compartmental model . this view is also supported by our additional simplified simulation assuming no efflux of from chloroplasts to the cytoplasm and that chloroplasts have an important yet to be identified contribution to _PROTEIN_ regulation of stomatal movements . to investigate further the effect of ca localization for driving intracellular concentration changes we used a distinct full spatial reaction diffusion mathematical model as reported by citation appropriately modified to represent a single cell of guard cell dimension surrounded by the bulk _LOCATION_ cell wall space . unlike the simplified compartmental model described above this model accounts for spatial variability and allows for the implementation of ca like activity at the inner leaflet of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . as before we allowed the system to reach equilibrium at a low ci and then increased the _PROTEIN_ concentration as described in materials and methods. figure illustrates the predicted intracellular concentration as a function of time for a simulation in which ca activity is implemented everywhere inside the cell or only at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . as a control we have also plotted the time course of the concentration for a simulation in which no ca like activity is implemented . note that each curve corresponds to the concentration at a depth of approximately into the cell . we have verified that this spatial model predicts virtually identical dynamics of concentration changes at any depth into the cell . this can be explained because of the small size of guard cells and the large diffusion rates of the reactants inside the cell . consistent with the single compartment model of a guard cell in the absence of ca like activity intracellular concentration rises very slowly whereas in the presence of ca like activity the production of occurs at a faster rate and therefore results in faster dynamics of concentration changes . when ca like activity is implemented everywhere in the _LOCATION_ the rise in concentration is faster than when ca like activity is implemented only at the inner leaflet of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . this difference in rates of concentration changes predicted in this simplified model occurs because when ca like activity is implemented everywhere in the cell there is a rapid consumption of incoming _PROTEIN_ at every location within the cell whereas when ca like activity is implemented only at the inner leaflet of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ this conversion occurs only near the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . nevertheless the concentration in the presence of _LOCATION_ bound cas increases faster than in the absence of any ca like activity . moreover this increase could be even faster by assuming an even larger ca activity at the _LOCATION_ . one prediction of the above model assuming that is the intracellular signal that transmits the _PROTEIN_ response is that longer exposures to elevated _PROTEIN_ should enable stomata of mutant plants to close to similar levels as wild type plants but at a slowed rate . because the rate of stomatal closing was found previously to be slowed in mutant plants we conducted experiments in which prolonged elevated _PROTEIN_ concentrations were applied . the stomatal conductance of mutant plants was reduced to a similar level compared with wild type plants when _PROTEIN_ was increased from to for more than min under the imposed conditions . these findings also point to secondary compensatory feedback _METHOD_ that may strengthen the response to _PROTEIN_ shifts in plants due to the enhanced stomatal conductance . these experiments suggest that if the starting _PROTEIN_ concentration is and the _PROTEIN_ concentration is rapidly increased to for prolonged exposures stomata eventually can close to similar or even lower levels than wild type plants .

incorporated ca like activity by multiplying the rate constants and by an acceleration _PROTEIN_ a . we assumed that the _LOCATION_ is permeable to _PROTEIN_ with a permeability constant pm . the rate equations corresponding to the above reactions can be easily obtained . for example for the _PROTEIN_ concentration we havewhere _PROTEIN_ is the external _PROTEIN_ concentration . the resulting set of equations was solved using an algorithm suitable for stiff ordinary differential equations using parameter values in citation . as initial conditions the initial internal and external _PROTEIN_ concentration were set to similar to _PROTEIN_ conditions measured in leaves exposed to light whereas the internal and external ph levels were taken to be and respectively . finally the acceleration _PROTEIN_ caused by ca activity was chosen to be five . at the start of the simulation the external _PROTEIN_ concentration was set to . for determining the effects of ca localization a small internal compartment representing an organelle such as the chloroplast taking up of the cell volume within a larger compartment that corresponds to the guard cell was simulated . the organelle _LOCATION_ was modeled as being permeable to either all components or exclusively _PROTEIN_ using the same permeability constants as for the cell _LOCATION_ . the acceleration _PROTEIN_ within the compartment representing the mutant guard cell s _LOCATION_ was taken to be one whereas this acceleration within the organelle aorg was varied . as a starting point we used the above mentioned reaction diffusion model of _PROTEIN_ influx into a xenopus laevis oocyte developed by citation . this model assumes that the cell is a perfectly symmetric sphere surrounded by a thin layer of _LOCATION_ unconvected
