chlorophyll b is one of the major photosynthetic pigments of plants . the regulation of chlorophyll b biosynthesis is important for plants in order to acclimate to changing environmental conditions . in the chloroplast chlorophyll b is synthesized from chlorophyll a by chlorophyllide a oxygenase _PROTEIN_ a rieske type monooxygenase . the activity of this enzyme is regulated at the level of protein stability via a feedback mechanism through chlorophyll b . the clp protease and the n terminal domain of _PROTEIN_ are essential for the regulatory mechanism . in this study we aimed to identify the specific amino acid residue or the sequence within the a domain that is essential for this regulation . to accomplish this goal we randomly introduced base substitutions into the a domain and searched for potentially important residues by analyzing transformants of arabidopsis thaliana . however none of the single amino acid substitutions significantly stabilized _PROTEIN_ . therefore we generated serial deletions in the a domain and _PROTEIN_ these deletions in the background of _PROTEIN_ deficient arabidopsis mutant . we found that the amino acid sequence is essential for the regulation of the protein stability . we furthermore determined that this sequence induces the destabilization of green _METHOD_ protein . these results suggest that this sequence serves as a degradation signal that is recognized by proteases functioning in the chloroplast .
to examine whether a specific amino acid residue or a specific sequence within the a domain is essential for the regulation of _PROTEIN_ stability we randomly introduced mutations into the a domain sequence and then _PROTEIN_ the mutated _PROTEIN_ sequences in arabidopsis to assess the effect of the mutations . in the second set of experiments we introduced serial deletions in the a domain sequence and _PROTEIN_ the truncated _PROTEIN_ sequences in arabidopsis . for these experiments we used the pgreenii binary vector which contains the kanamycin resistance gene for selection of transgenic plants . we introduced the following sequences into this vector the cauliflower mosaic virus s promoter the sequence the full length sequence for _PROTEIN_ the _METHOD_ coding sequence and the nopaline synthase terminator . the construct was similar to those used in our previous study . however in contrast to our previous vectors where the _METHOD_ sequence was inserted upstream of the _PROTEIN_ sequence the _METHOD_ sequence was inserted downstream of the c domain of _PROTEIN_ . we made this change because we anticipated that genetic manipulations of the a domain sequence might affect the conformation of _METHOD_ if the _METHOD_ sequence is fused adjacent to the a domain . the vector constructs were then introduced into a _PROTEIN_ deficient mutant for _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein . this mutant was used instead of the wild type in order to eliminate the possibility that the endogenous _PROTEIN_ interferes with the phenotype of the _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ and immunoblot analysis showed that the _PROTEIN_ of the full length _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion did not accumulate the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein whereas the _PROTEIN_ of the b and c domains fused to _METHOD_ _METHOD_ accumulated substantial amounts of protein . considering the same transcriptional levels of transgenes in bc _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ these experiments demonstrated that the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein was destabilized in the _PROTEIN_ . this was also observed in the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ described in our previous study . the chlorophyll a to b ratios in these transgenic plants are consistent with the levels of the transgene products . the bc _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ exhibited a lower chlorophyll a to b ratio than the wild type and the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . in our initial random mutagenesis screens we only analyzed one seedling per line . however for lines that showed higher _METHOD_ signals in the first screening we analyzed several progenies per line to confirm their phenotypes . in the serial deletion experiments we analyzed several transgenic lines for each construct to circumvent the positional effects of transgene insertion into the genome . because we always observed similar phenotypes among the lines that contained the same transgene construct we present here the results from one representative line for each construct . note that most _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ exhibited stable phenotypes among transgenic lines _PROTEIN_ the same construct . this suggests that the modification of _PROTEIN_ protein structure gave a more pronounced effect on protein stability than the positional effects of transgene insertion into the genome on the _PROTEIN_ transcript levels . this observation may reflect the characteristics of the regulatory mechanism of _PROTEIN_ in which the _PROTEIN_ protein level is primarily determined by protein stability . we searched for specific amino acids that are essential for the regulation of _PROTEIN_ in the a domain by employing a random mutagenesis approach . we introduced mutations into the dna sequence encoding the a domain in vitro by the combination of two methods hydroxylamine treatment and random pcr mutagenesis . the former method induces c to t or g to a substitution . in contrast the other method induces a to t/g or t to c substitution . by combining both methods it is theoretically possible to cause all types of base substitutions in double stranded dna . mutagenized sequences were then cloned into the pgreenii vector for subsequent _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein in arabidopsis . to estimate the frequency of base substitution we determined the nucleotide sequences for the a domain from independent and randomly selected _PROTEIN_ . the average number of nucleotide mutations per sequence was causing an average of amino acid substitutions/sequence . among the _PROTEIN_ we sequenced lines had at least a single mutation . this mutation frequency was comparable with those reported previously . among the bases of the sequence encoding the a domain there are guanine adenine cytosine and thymine bases . thymine was the most frequently substituted of the t bases were substituted to any other bases in at least one _PROTEIN_ . in contrast the lowest frequency of substitution was for g bases . using the results from this analysis we estimated using the recurrence equation how many _PROTEIN_ we should analyze to find at least one substitution in any base in the a domain sequence . we calculated that more than of the total bases should be mutated at least once among a population of _PROTEIN_ . therefore by screening _PROTEIN_ we would expect at least one mutation in any base in the a domain sequence with a probability of . accordingly we screened _PROTEIN_ for increased accumulation of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein by _PROTEIN_ . we found _PROTEIN_ exhibiting _METHOD_ _METHOD_ above the background level although the _METHOD_ intensities of these _PROTEIN_ were much lower than those of the bc _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . we found that accumulation of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein was most intense in guard cells compared with other leaf cells . this could be explained by the _PROTEIN_ that guard cells produce less chlorophyll than mesophyll cells which may result in lower degradation activity for _PROTEIN_ . fig . shows a _PROTEIN_ image of a representative single line which we designated . using immunoblot analysis and a _METHOD_ specific antibody we found that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein accumulated in although that protein level was much lower than that of bc _METHOD_ . in contrast _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein could not be detected in the control line which _PROTEIN_ the intact a domain sequence fused with _METHOD_ . sequence analysis showed that had two amino acid substitutions in the a domain . in order to confirm whether one of these substitutions contributed to the phenotype of we generated two site directed mutants containing either or substitutions . in the site directed mutant the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein accumulated to the same level as in . in contrast the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein was not detected . these results demonstrate that the substitution is responsible for the increased stability of _PROTEIN_ in the _PROTEIN_ . we found that among the _PROTEIN_ six lines contained the same mutations . this may be explained by the _PROTEIN_ that we amplified the plasmid constructs after mutagenesis which were then used for plant transformation . we therefore conclude that the _PROTEIN_ were transformants of independent mutant plasmids . in fig . we summarized the identified substitutions of amino acids within the _PROTEIN_ . redundant mutations from the same clones were omitted from this summary . the average number of amino acid substitutions in the _PROTEIN_ was . when multiple substitutions were present in one clone it is possible that only one of them contributed to the increase in _PROTEIN_ stability . therefore it is possible that a substantial portion of these substitutions did not contribute to the increase in _PROTEIN_ stability . when a clone contained a single substitution it is most likely that this mutation contributed to increased _PROTEIN_ stability . we found three such mutations in three independent clones . alternatively when the substitutions in the same amino acid were found in different clones it is possible that the amino acid contributed to increased _PROTEIN_ stability . for amino acids we found multiple substitutions in different clones . these amino acids whose mutations probably contributed to increased _PROTEIN_ stability in the _PROTEIN_ were distributed throughout the a domain sequence . taking into account our observation that none of the _PROTEIN_ showed a level of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ equivalent to that of the bc _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ we concluded that there is no unique amino acid in the a domain sequence vital in the regulation of _PROTEIN_ stability . it is likely that multiple amino acid substitutions at one time may be required to eliminate the function of the a domain . we therefore speculate that modification of a single specific amino acid is not involved in the regulation . in a second set of experiments we generated serial deletions of the a domain sequence by consecutively deleting amino acids using the plasmid construct that contains the a domain fused to b and c domains of _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ . consequently we obtained ten plasmid constructs containing different lengths of the a domain . these constructs were then introduced into the mutant . deletions of the a domain sequence up to amino acid gln had no effect on _METHOD_ _METHOD_ in the _PROTEIN_ . in contrast deletions up to amino acid his or further deletions resulted in significant accumulation of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion proteins in the respective _PROTEIN_ . the intensities of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ in the deletion mutants up to or beyond his were equivalent to that in the _PROTEIN_ lacking the entire a domain _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . the same consequences of protein level of transgene products were detected by immunoblot analysis . deletions up to or beyond his resulted in a drastic increase in _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein levels in the _PROTEIN_ . chlorophyll a to b ratios were in the _PROTEIN_ with deletions up to arg whereas ratios _PROTEIN_ to less than in the _PROTEIN_ with deletions beyond gln . collectively these results indicate that the amino acid sequence from gln to his is essential in the regulation of the _PROTEIN_ protein level . in order to assess whether the sequence from gln to his was sufficient to induce destabilization of _PROTEIN_ this sequence was fused to bc _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ in the mutants _METHOD_ . as controls the other parts of the a domain were fused to bc _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ in the same mutant _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . in the bc _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was not detected whereas the other _PROTEIN_ showed significant _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . consistent with these results is the _PROTEIN_ that the bc _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ did not have detectable amounts of the fusion protein whereas the _PROTEIN_ for the other parts of the a domain accumulated significant amounts of the fusion proteins . accordingly the chlorophyll a to b ratio was similar to that of wild type in the bc _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . in contrast the chlorophyll a to b ratios _PROTEIN_ to in the other _PROTEIN_ which did not contain the sequence from gln to his . taken together we conclude that the amino acid sequence qdlltiimilh in the a domain is the degradation signal sequence . we designated it the _PROTEIN_ degron . subsequently we tested whether the _PROTEIN_ degron regulates degradation of proteins other than _PROTEIN_ . we fused the _PROTEIN_ degron to _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ the protein _METHOD_ in wild type and . as a control we _PROTEIN_ the fusion of the sequence from asp to val with _METHOD_ _METHOD_ in wild type and . _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ alone in the chloroplast resulted in strong _METHOD_ _METHOD_ in entire chloroplasts of the wild type and backgrounds . the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ also showed significant _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . in contrast when the _PROTEIN_ degron was fused to _METHOD_ the _METHOD_ signal was detected neither in the wild type nor . there was a notable difference in _METHOD_ _METHOD_ of the _METHOD_ and a _METHOD_ constructs when _PROTEIN_ in _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was detected in the a _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ but not in the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . the results of the _PROTEIN_ analysis were consistent with the immunoblot analysis . the a _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ accumulated a substantial amount of the a _METHOD_ protein whereas the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ did not accumulate detectable protein levels . these results demonstrate that the _PROTEIN_ degron functions as a degradation signal sequence for proteins other than _PROTEIN_ . our data also suggest that the other part of the a domain is necessary to confer chlorophyll b dependence of the degradation process . next we examined whether the other sequences similar to the _PROTEIN_ degron participated in the regulation of protein stability in the chloroplast . in order to find such sequences we first searched the arabidopsis protein data base for sequences similar to the _PROTEIN_ degron using the patmatch program at the web site of the arabidopsis information resource . we did not find any sequences that matched more than residues of the _PROTEIN_ degron residues . there were six sequences that matched the _PROTEIN_ degron with residues . however these proteins are all predicted to localize outside of the chloroplast . therefore these sequences may not function as degrons . these results are not surprising because bacterial degrons are not strictly conserved as described above . when we allowed various patterns of mismatches in our sequence search we obtained a greater number of sequences using the arabidopsis protein data base . for example if we searched the data base with qxlltjmjlx as a query and if we allowed mismatches for the search we found that sequences matched these conditions . in these sequences we found that a core subunit of photosystem ii contains a sequence similar to the _PROTEIN_ degron . this sequence shares four identical amino acids and common features with the _PROTEIN_ degron containing a charged residue followed by a stretch of hydrophobic residues and ending with a histidine residue . we tentatively named this sequence the degron like sequence . the sequence locates near the n terminus of . to examine whether the amino acid sequence functions as a degron we made a transgenic plant that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fused with _METHOD_ . in order to determine the level of _METHOD_ we carried out confocal microscopy and immunoblot analyses . the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ signal in the _PROTEIN_ was substantially lower than those of b _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ but it was higher than that in _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . by immunoblotting analysis we estimated that the level of the _METHOD_ fusion protein in the _PROTEIN_ was about of the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . these results indicate that functions as a weak degron in the chloroplast .
the wild ecotype columbia and the mutant of arabidopsis thaliana plants were used for the transformation . for propagation plants were germinated on soil and grown at under continuous light conditions _METHOD_ . for analysis of transgenic plants seeds were germinated on plates containing half strength murashige skoog medium agar and mg/liter kanamycin . plants were grown for week at under continuous light conditions . in order to _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion proteins we modified the plasmid vector that was constructed in our previous study . the vector contained the cauliflower mosaic virus s promoter the tobacco mosaic virus sequence the _METHOD_ sequence and the nopaline terminator in the backbone of pgreenii . the _METHOD_ gene in this plasmid was fused with transgenes _PROTEIN_ at the sali and noti sites . the plasmids were subsequently transformed into an agrobacterium tumefaciens by electroporation using a cuvette with a mm gap at microfarads and kv . wild type arabidopsis and the mutant were transformed by the vacuum infiltration as described by bechtold and pelletier . primary transformants were selected on agar plates containing mg/ml kanamycin as described above . lines that showed elevated accumulation of _METHOD_ fusion proteins were selected and their progenies were subjected for further analysis . ten _METHOD_ of rosette leaves were homogenized with of extraction buffer glycerol _PROTEIN_ and mercaptoethanol . homogenates were centrifuged at g for min and supernatants were subjected to polyacrylamide _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ separation . subsequently the resolved proteins were electroblotted onto a hybond p _LOCATION_ . the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transferred proteins were detected with an anti _METHOD_ rabbit primary antibody and an anti _PROTEIN_ rabbit primary antiserum that was raised against the recombinant arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ polypeptide _PROTEIN_ produced in escherichia coli in our laboratory . anti rabbit igg linked to horseradish peroxidase was used as a secondary antibody . the horseradish peroxidase activity was detected using the ecl plus western blotting detection system following the manufacturer 's protocol . _METHOD_ images were recorded at the nikon imaging centre at hokkaido university on a spectral imaging confocal laser scanning microscopy _PROTEIN_ system with a e inverted microscope . the microscope was equipped with a nikon _PROTEIN_ objective lens series plan apochromat numerical aperture oil immersion type lens . an argon laser was used to generate an excitation source at nm and _METHOD_ and chlorophyll _METHOD_ were recorded at and nm respectively . images were processed with ez viewer . the gain levels of _METHOD_ intensity for each image were as follows _METHOD_ images _METHOD_ images _METHOD_ b _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ images other images . chlorophyll was extracted from rosette leaves of a. thaliana using acetone . extracts were centrifuged at g for min at . the supernatant was diluted with water to a final acetone concentration of and subjected to high pressure liquid chromatography analysis . pigments were separated on an octadodecyl column and eluted with methanol at a flow rate of ml/min . elution profiles were monitored by measuring absorbance at nm . chlorophyll contents were quantified from the chromatographic peak area . random mutagenesis was carried out by combining the methods of random pcr and of hydroxylamine treatment . the cloned _PROTEIN_ cdna from arabidopsis leaves was pcr amplified using pmol of primers mm mm mm tris hcl mm kcl mm datp mm dgtp mm dctp mm dttp and taq dna polymerase . pcr was performed for cycles at for min for min and for . pcr products were separated on a agarose gel and visualized by the sybersafe dna gel stain and extracted using the qiaquick gel extraction kit . extracted dna was treated with m hydroxylamine at for h. treated dna was kept at room temperature for min and was separated on agarose gel and extracted again as described above . dna was then incorporated into the pgreen ii mh binary vector containing the sequences encoding the b and c domains of _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ . the constructs were used for agrobacterium mediated transformation of as described above .
