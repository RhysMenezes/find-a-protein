the differentiation of hair and non hair cells in the arabidopsis thaliana root epidermis is dependent on positional relationships with underlying cortical cells . we previously found that histone acetylation relays positional information and that a mutant altered in the histone deacetylase gene family member histone deacetylase _PROTEIN_ exhibits altered h and n epidermal cell patterning . here we report that _PROTEIN_ has in vitro histone deacetylase activity and that both mutation and overexpression of _PROTEIN_ led to cells at the n position having h fate . the _PROTEIN_ protein physically interacted with histones related to a specific group of kinase genes which are demonstrated in this study to be components of a positional information relay system . both down and upregulation of _PROTEIN_ increased transcription of the targeted kinase genes . interestingly the acetylation levels of histone lysine histone lysine _PROTEIN_ and histone lysine _PROTEIN_ at the kinase genes were differentially affected by down or upregulation of _PROTEIN_ which explains why the transcription levels of the four _PROTEIN_ target kinase genes increased in all lines with altered _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . our results reveal the surprisingly complex mechanism by which _PROTEIN_ affects cellular patterning in arabidopsis root epidermis .
_PROTEIN_ is located on chromosome . the genomic sequence contains bp and the coding sequence contains bp including eight exons . analysis of data at arex indicated that _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ at low levels with no tissue preference . these results are consistent with previous in situ hybridization observations . because of the similarity between the _PROTEIN_ mutant phenotype and the effects of the hdac inhibitor _PROTEIN_ on cellular patterning of the root epidermis we tested recombinant _PROTEIN_ protein for hdac activity . the recombinant protein had significant hdac activity which was concentration dependent and inhibited by _PROTEIN_ . an in gel assay using hyperacetylated histones extracted from hela cells as substrates and commercially available histone specific antibodies as indicators revealed that the recombinant protein deacetylated all four core histones suggesting that the hdac domain of _PROTEIN_ does not have preferential activity on any of the core histones . transient _PROTEIN_ of enhanced green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ labeled _PROTEIN_ in onion epidermis revealed that the _PROTEIN_ protein was localized to both the _LOCATION_ and cytoplasm which is consistent with bioinformatic predictions . this result was further verified by observation of _METHOD_ localization in stable transgenic arabidopsis lines containing the same construct for _METHOD_ labeled _PROTEIN_ . to understand further the role of _PROTEIN_ in cellular patterning we analyzed the phenotypes of a t dna insertion mutant _PROTEIN_ an rna interference line _PROTEIN_ an overexpression line driven by the promoter _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and an oe line driven by the promoter of the _PROTEIN_ gene pwer _PROTEIN_ gus _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ mutant and _PROTEIN_ rnai line exhibited conversion of some cells at n positions to h fate similar to the previously described _PROTEIN_ mutant line . unexpectedly however the two _PROTEIN_ oe lines also displayed this phenotype . the number of cells at n positions that were converted to h fate significantly increased in both mutants and overexpressing lines based on statistics analysis compared with wild type plants . introduction of an n cell specific reporter the _PROTEIN_ promoter driving green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in the _PROTEIN_ mutant enabled us to identify cell fate patterns further indicating the conversion of cells at the n position to h fate . we attempted to rescue the mutant phenotype by complementation . however possibly because of the low native _PROTEIN_ level of _PROTEIN_ all transgenic lines were found to overexpress the gene and thus exhibited the corresponding phenotype . to test whether the effect of _PROTEIN_ could be enhanced by _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ single mutants that do not have altered cellular patterning in the root epidermis we introduced artificial microrna constructs targeting _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ into the _PROTEIN_ mutant . we also introduced artificial microrna constructs targeting _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ into the _PROTEIN_ mutant . no enhanced phenotypes were observed in transgenic lines in which all three targeted genes were downregulated . these results suggest that the role of _PROTEIN_ in the production of the mutant phenotype is independent of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ its two most closely related members of the class ii subfamily . to test whether altered _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ affected the _PROTEIN_ centered tfn we examined the _PROTEIN_ of five representative pattern genes _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and related genes _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ rnai and _PROTEIN_ . we did not further analyze _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ oe/wer lines at the molecular level because the former is a weak allele and the latter has a similar phenotype to the _PROTEIN_ line with no obvious differential _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in the h and n position . we found that the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ was significantly downregulated in all three lines . _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were upregulated in the mutant line while those of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were not changed significantly . these results reveal that the pattern of gene _PROTEIN_ was affected differentially by altered levels of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . we previously determined that the histone acetylation status of pattern genes was altered upon treatment with the hdac inhibitor _PROTEIN_ and we confirmed here that _PROTEIN_ has in vitro hdac activity . we therefore examined whether _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ affects the histone acetylation status of pattern genes . using the previously identified dna fragments that displayed altered levels of histone acetylation in response to _PROTEIN_ treatment we found that upon down or upregulation of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ the acetylation levels of and increased to some extent in three representative pattern genes _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . the increases in acetylation of at _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were statistically significant in the _PROTEIN_ rnai line while those of and at _PROTEIN_ were statistically significant in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ lines . these data reveal that although the downregulation of _PROTEIN_ indeed increased histone acetylation consistent with the previously observed _PROTEIN_ effects the increased histone acetylation status of the _PROTEIN_ line could not be directly explained by _PROTEIN_ functioning as an hdac . to clarify further if _PROTEIN_ is involved in the transcriptional regulation of pattern genes we examined whether the _PROTEIN_ protein directly binds to chromatin thus altering pattern gene related histone acetylation using an antibody against _PROTEIN_ . surprisingly none of the dna fragments tested were enriched in this chromatin immunoprecipitation _PROTEIN_ experiment . because the primers used in the _PROTEIN_ pcr assay covered only limited areas of chromatin we performed a _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ screen to search for possible binding sites at the genome level . among the enriched dna fragments _PROTEIN_ none was related to any of the pattern genes . taken together we conclude that although altered _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ affects the cellular patterning of the root epidermis this effect does not appear to be due to the direct transcriptional regulation of pattern genes . as _PROTEIN_ did not directly regulate the _PROTEIN_ of pattern genes we explored how altered _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ was linked to cellular patterning . we searched among the dna fragments identified in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ experiment for genes with annotated functions potentially related to cellular patterning of the root epidermis and found that of these fragments encoded kinases in addition to nine encoding transcription _PROTEIN_ eight encoding chromatin modification _PROTEIN_ four functioning in root development and one encoding a phosphatase . these data suggest that _PROTEIN_ can directly bind to genes as is common for hdac proteins and may affect cellular patterning via these target genes . because both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ localized receptor like kinases we reasoned that there must be some downstream components that transduce the positional information sensed by the receptors . the preferential enrichment of kinase genes in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ data suggested that _PROTEIN_ might function in the relay of positional information by regulating the transcription of these kinase genes . to test this possibility we first verified that _PROTEIN_ binds to the candidate dna fragments including all putative kinase genes by performing _PROTEIN_ pcr . we found that candidates were enriched whereas five were not . to examine whether _PROTEIN_ is involved in the transcriptional regulation of the targeted genes we examined the _PROTEIN_ of the verified _PROTEIN_ bound genes in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ treated wild type plants . among the genes that were tested two showed changes in _PROTEIN_ that were correlated with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ level five showed upregulation to various extents _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ levels in all lines and the remaining eight showed no significant changes in their _PROTEIN_ levels that could be correlated with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . we then analyzed the mutant phenotypes of all _PROTEIN_ targeted genes . we found that mutations in eight of the genes led to the conversion of some cells at the n position to h fate . among these eight genes six were kinases one was a wd gene and one was a basic _PROTEIN_ loop _PROTEIN_ gene . mutations in and both bound by _PROTEIN_ and annotated as kinase genes did not induce cell fate conversion phenotypes in the root indicating that these _PROTEIN_ targeted genes may either not be involved in the patterning process or may be involved in a redundant manner . although mutations of _GENE_ and _GENE_ produced the cellular patterning phenotype the transcription levels of these genes were not significantly affected by that of _PROTEIN_ . we therefore focused our further investigations on the remaining kinase genes . first we verified the phenotype by introducing the cell type specific reporter _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ into the corresponding mutants . we found that _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ patterns were altered in the kinase mutants consistent with the phenotypes revealed by paraffin sectioning . we next examined the histone acetylation status of the four kinase genes in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ rnai and _PROTEIN_ at the verified _PROTEIN_ binding sites . the levels of acetylation were significantly increased at _GENE_ in all three lines at _GENE_ in _PROTEIN_ rnai and _PROTEIN_ and at in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ rnai . acetylation was significantly increased at _GENE_ in _PROTEIN_ rnai and _PROTEIN_ . taken together these data indicate that _PROTEIN_ binds to and is involved in the transcriptional regulation of some genes including _GENE_ _GENE_ _GENE_ and . we next explored how the cell conversion phenotype could result from both the upregulation of target kinase genes _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and the downregulation of these same genes . we chose the straightforward approach of constructing oe transgenic lines for these kinase genes to determine whether increased _PROTEIN_ of these genes might produce a similar phenotype as loss of function mutations . oe lines for each of the four _PROTEIN_ targeted kinase genes _GENE_ _GENE_ _GENE_ and indeed caused some cells at the n position to convert to h fate . these results demonstrate that both down and upregulation of kinase gene _PROTEIN_ could result in this phenotype indicating that homeostasis of _PROTEIN_ of the kinase genes is required for cellular patterning in the arabidopsis root epidermis and implicating these kinase genes as components relaying positional information during this process . it is intriguing that both the down and upregulation of _PROTEIN_ resulted in the cell conversion phenotype . to address the underlying _METHOD_ of this we examined the efficiency of enrichment of the _PROTEIN_ protein on the kinase genes . figure shows that as expected the enrichment of _PROTEIN_ protein on the dna of all four kinase genes was significantly reduced in the lines with reduced _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ gene . however unexpectedly the _PROTEIN_ enrichment level was similar to that of the wild type in the lines with increased _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . these observations suggest that the phenotype of the upregulated _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ lines can not simply be explained by _PROTEIN_ target binding by the _PROTEIN_ protein . next we analyzed the histone acetylation status of specific amino acid residues in the lines with altered _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . as indicated in figure the overall histone acetylation at the kinase genes increased to various levels . as more significantly increased acetylation levels were observed in than in we chose for further analysis . among the seven known lys residues available for acetylation in the n terminal tail acetylated lys lys lys and lys are responsible for promoting transcription . therefore we examined the acetylation levels at lys lys lys and lys of at the four kinase genes in the _PROTEIN_ mutant the rnai line _PROTEIN_ and the oe line _PROTEIN_ . figures to show that although there were some variations the acetylation levels at the lys residues changed in similar patterns except for the acetylation levels of at the kinase genes were significantly enhanced under reduced levels of _PROTEIN_ but were not significantly changed with increased _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . the acetylation levels of _PROTEIN_ in all four kinase genes were significantly enhanced under both reduced and increased _PROTEIN_ levels . in contrast with the acetylation levels of _PROTEIN_ in all four kinase genes were significantly enhanced under increased _PROTEIN_ levels but not under _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ levels except in _GENE_ . the acetylation levels were all enhanced to some extent whether _PROTEIN_ was down or upregulated . the above data suggest that the down and upregulation of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ affect the acetylation of the four detected lys residues differentially .
