arabidopsis cell growth defect _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was originally isolated as a cell growth suppressor of yeast from genetic screening . to investigate the in vivo role of _PROTEIN_ in plants a t dna insertion line was analyzed . a homozygous t dna insertion mutant _PROTEIN_ was embryo lethal and showed arrested embryogenesis at the globular stage . the _PROTEIN_ protein when fused with green _METHOD_ protein was localized to the _LOCATION_ in stomatal guard cells and mesophyll cells . a promoter _PROTEIN_ assay found _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in the early heart stage of embryogenesis suggesting that _PROTEIN_ was essential for arabidopsis embryogenesis during the transition of the embryo from the globular to heart stage .
the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ gene was originally isolated and used as a cell growth suppressor of yeast based on effects of artificial overexpression . in an attempt to investigate the function of _PROTEIN_ in plants a single t dna insertion line garlic was obtained . no homozygous _PROTEIN_ mutant individuals were detected among seeds of self fertilized heterozygous plants suggesting that _PROTEIN_ confers a lethal phenotype . the phenotype of the heterozygote was indistinguishable from that of wild type plants indicating that only one copy of a functional _PROTEIN_ is sufficient for embryogenesis and other plant growth events . among immature siliques of heterozygous plants white abnormal seeds were observed . furthermore dark brown aborted seeds were noted in mature siliques of heterozygous plants . when ten immature siliques of heterozygous plants were observed the abnormal white seeds constituted about of the total suggesting that the phenotype was controlled by a single gene . to confirm that the abnormal seed phenotype resulted from the insertion of t dna in the _PROTEIN_ gene a heterozygous plant was crossed with a transgenic line in which _PROTEIN_ cdna was overexpressed under control of the camv promoter . the progenies were grown on _METHOD_ medium containing bialaphos and hygromycin because the t dna insert possesses a bialaphos resistant gene and ox plants are hygromycin resistant . the bialaphos/hygromycin double resistant seedlings were screened to identify heterozygotes possessing _PROTEIN_ . among the self fertilized seeds of the screened progeny homozygous plants that showed complementation of the mutation _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were isolated and the presence of the cdna was confirmed by pcr . as shown in fig . b t dna insertion to the _PROTEIN_ gene and the existence of overexpressed _PROTEIN_ cdna were monitored by amplification with appropriate primer sets . the intact _PROTEIN_ gene was detected by amplification with primer pair suggesting that a complemented _PROTEIN_ plant overexpressing _PROTEIN_ cdna had been obtained . the complemented plant _PROTEIN_ showed normal seed development as shown in fig . . when ten siliques of the complemented lines were observed abnormal seeds constituted about of the total . furthermore the complemented line and _PROTEIN_ overexpressor did not show any differences in growth rate compared to wild type or heterozygous plants under normal growth conditions . to investigate the cause of lethality embryo development in different developing seeds of siliques of wild type and heterozygous plants was analyzed using a nomarski microscope . the embryos of the two plants were indistinguishable before the globular stage . however in older siliques when the wild type plants had embryos at the heart stage about of the embryos of heterozygous plants were arrested at the globular stage . as demonstrated in a previous work various intracellular localization tools predicted _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ localization of the _PROTEIN_ protein . the _PROTEIN_ protein sequence is predicted to encode a chloroplast transient peptide at the n terminus and three transmembrane domains . to experimentally verify the subcellular localization of the _PROTEIN_ protein _PROTEIN_ cdna was fused to the n terminus of the _METHOD_ gene . the resultant plasmid _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was _PROTEIN_ under the control of the camv promoter in wild type arabidopsis and the _METHOD_ signal in transgenic plants was observed by _METHOD_ microscopy . as shown in fig . _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was associated with _LOCATION_ in stomata cells and mesophyll cells in leaves . furthermore arabidopsis plants were transformed by another plasmid containing the promoter region of _PROTEIN_ fused with the n terminal ten amino acids of _PROTEIN_ and gus . histochemical analysis of _PROTEIN_ promoter activity showed a strong signal in whole plant organs . especially strong signals were detected in young leaves flowers and the root elongation zone . in addition _PROTEIN_ promoter activity was low in the globular stage but was stimulated in the heart and linear stages and _PROTEIN_ through the mature embryo stage .
arabidopsis ecotype columbia was used as the wild type plant in this study . seeds were sterilized with sodium hypochlorite solution and grown on either plates containing _METHOD_ medium with gellan gum and sucrose or jiffy pellets . all plant materials were grown at under continuous light . the t dna insertion line was obtained from syngenta . to determine the position of the t dna insert a dna fragment was amplified by pcr with specific primers for the t dna left border and _PROTEIN_ and the nucleotide sequence of the resulting product was determined . the garlic line had a t dna insertion in its first intron . the t dna left border primer tagcatctgaatttcataaccaatctcgatacac and gene specific primer tccttgtccctcaatttgaatctcaacttt were used to screen plants for t dna insertion . the t dna bordering dna fragment was ligated into the plasmid pgem and sequenced to determine the location of the t dna . genetic and microscopy experiments were used to determine embryo defective phenotypes in seeds of self fertilized heterozygotes and seeds of plants produced by complementation crosses . using stereomicroscopy the siliques were examined to determine the proportion of abnormal seeds . furthermore mature seeds were examined under a tabletop scanning microscope . the _PROTEIN_ was fused with cauliflower mosaic virus promoter . the plasmid _PROTEIN_ was constructed using a pcr amplified sali/saci tagged _PROTEIN_ cdna fragment . the _METHOD_ vector has been described previously . the resultant plasmid _PROTEIN_ was introduced into arabidopsis through agrobacterium mediated transformation . plant lines possessing a single transgene were self fertilized to obtain homozygous plants . for complementation crossing heterozygous plants were pollinated with the _PROTEIN_ line . seeds were selected on _METHOD_ medium containing bialaphos and hygromycin . the selected plants were self fertilized and seeds were obtained . among the seeds homozygous _PROTEIN_ plants possessing _PROTEIN_ were identified and confirmed by genomic pcr using primers _PROTEIN_ and ttaggagctcgagtgtccatgtaggctgaa . siliques from heterozygous or wild type plants at different developmental stages were dissected and examined using an mz apo stereomicroscope . immature siliques were fixed in acetone and acetic acid overnight and gradually hydrated using serial dilutions of ethanol solutions . the samples were washed with distilled water and then dipped in m chloral hydrate in glycerol/water solution . the chloral hydrate treated transparentized tissues were observed using an hc/dmr microscope equipped with nomarski optics . the sali tagged pcr amplified _PROTEIN_ cdna fragment was ligated with the sali digested pbig _METHOD_ cassette vector . the resultant plasmid _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was introduced into arabidopsis through agrobacterium mediated transformation . the transformants were grown on _METHOD_ plates or jiffy pellets and then examined under a _METHOD_ microscope . the promoter _PROTEIN_ reporter assay plasmid consisted of kbp of the _PROTEIN_ promoter region and the part encoding the n terminal ten amino acids of _PROTEIN_ fused with the gus reporter . the genomic fragment of _PROTEIN_ promoter was amplified with primers ggtcgactggcaaaactcaaactccacttc and ttctagagataaacgaagaagatacagtag by pcr and inserted into the sali/xbai site of the cassette plasmid containing the gus reporter gene . the resultant plasmid was introduced into the agrobacterium tumefaciens strain and transgenic arabidopsis plants were obtained by agrobacterium mediated transformation . gus assays were performed as described previously .
