gene families with multiple members are predicted to have individuals with overlapping functions . we examined all of the arabidopsis myosin family members for their involvement in _LOCATION_ and other organelle motility . truncated fragments of all annotated arabidopsis myosins containing either the iq tail or tail domains only were fused to _METHOD_ markers and coexpressed with a _LOCATION_ marker in two different plants . we tracked and calculated _LOCATION_ body displacement rate in the presence of all myosin truncations and found that tail fragments of myosins _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ xi c xi e xi i and xi k were the best inhibitors of _LOCATION_ body movement in the two plants . tail fragments of myosins xi b xi f xi h and _PROTEIN_ had an inhibitory effect on _LOCATION_ bodies only in nicotiana tabacum while tail fragments of myosins xi g and _PROTEIN_ had a slight effect on _LOCATION_ body motility only in nicotiana benthamiana . the best myosin inhibitors of _LOCATION_ body motility were able to arrest mitochondrial movement too . no exclusive colocalization was found between these myosins and _LOCATION_ bodies in our system although the excess of _LOCATION_ signal observed could mask myosin molecules bound to the surface of the organelle . from the preserved actin filaments found in the presence of enhanced green _METHOD_ protein fusions of truncated myosins and the motility of myosin punctae we conclude that global arrest of actomyosin derived cytoplasmic streaming had not occurred . taken together our data suggest that the above myosins are involved directly or indirectly in the movement of _LOCATION_ and mitochondria in plant cells .
in order to compare the involvement of all annotated arabidopsis myosins with _LOCATION_ movement we isolated sequenced and subcloned a fragment containing the iq coiled coil and tail domains of all of them downstream to enhanced green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ or containing the coiled coil and tail domains downstream of mono red _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ . the idea was to create dominant negative clones of each myosin family member that lacks the head actin binding domain but should still be able to bind cargo . this should saturate the binding sites and compete out the function of endogenous wild type myosin molecules . sequence analysis of several independent clones in both laboratories revealed the following differences in translation compared with the annotated database sequences . in myosin xi d instead of _PROTEIN_ we found vsftrpp which probably results from a different splicing site and an a to v change in position . in myosin xi g nucleotides to are missing again this _METHOD_ to be a different splicing site prediction . in myosin _PROTEIN_ we found that the predicted vvflpdvc is ellseqfe again this is probably a result of different splicing . the clone of _PROTEIN_ in our hands contains an to change . genevestigator analysis of _PROTEIN_ patterns of arabidopsis myosins revealed that myosins _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ from the group of myosin viii and myosins xi a xi b xi c xi d xi e and xi j are _PROTEIN_ at high levels in pollen . these myosins are _PROTEIN_ also in the mature leaf but at levels two to five times lower than other myosin family members . previously it was shown that myosins from nicotiana benthamiana possess a high degree of sequence and functional homology to their arabidopsis counterparts . in addition the functions of arabidopsis myosins xi k and xi e were proven in n. tabacum . therefore we decided to compare different fragments of all arabidopsis myosins in n. tabacum and n. benthamiana and to study their subcellular localization and ability to arrest the motility of _LOCATION_ and other different organelles . first the subcellular localizations of tail and iq tail myosin truncations were compared with each other and with _LOCATION_ bodies . myosin tails were coexpressed with a _METHOD_ _LOCATION_ body marker _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in n.t . epidermal cells in addition the localization of the two different myosin fusions _METHOD_ tail and _METHOD_ iq tail were compared by coexpression in n.t . and the _METHOD_ iq tail fusions were _PROTEIN_ in n.b . . a general observation was that while class viii fusions _PROTEIN_ located to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and/or the nucleolus _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ class xi fusions tended to be in more motile punctate structures _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or diffuse throughout the cytoplasm . xi a xi b and xi g tail/iq tail _PROTEIN_ tended to vary from motile puncta to diffuse . interestingly both xi i truncations collocated to punctate structures and also collocated to the _LOCATION_ envelope in both plant species . none of the myosin fusions solely colocated with _LOCATION_ bodies but the surrounding _LOCATION_ location could represent a small proportion of bound myosin fusions . upon coexpression most of the iq tail and tail fusions of the same myosin gene colocated to the same structures in n.t . with few exceptions the _PROTEIN_ iq tail fusion did not colocate to the nucleolus unlike the shorter tail fusion xi a and xi c tail and iq tail fusions were diffuse throughout the _LOCATION_ and the iq tail fusion was also in the nucleoplasm . thus it is suggested that subcellular localization is similar whether or not the iq domain is present . in order to study the effect of each myosin on the motility of _LOCATION_ we coexpressed each myosin fragment with a _LOCATION_ marker in two different nicotiana species . tail fusions were _PROTEIN_ in n.t . and iq tail fusions were _PROTEIN_ in n.b . myosin fusions that behaved differently in the two nicotiana species were _PROTEIN_ and compared in n.b . this comparison allowed us to verify variations derived from either the plant or the length of the myosin fusion . owing to the variability of organelle movement within a cell large samples of organelles were analyzed from at least movies from three to five independent experiments . volocity software was used to track organelles and calculate velocity and displacement rates of each tracked organelle over time . displacement rate is the final distance an organelle moves between the first and last frame of the time lapse sequence over time . we found that organelles that were undergoing short range oscillations in one spot but appeared by eye to have stopped moving obtained somewhat unexpectedly high values of velocity calculated by the software . the two data sets from n.t . and n.b . were acquired using different rates of image acquisition which had a different influence on velocity values determined for such oscillatory movements . however this did not affect displacement rate measurements since this is a measure of movement away from the starting point and is not significantly affected by short range oscillatory motion . the two data sets generated from n.b . and n.t. therefore were compared using the displacement rate values as they are a better reflection of the perturbation of directional organelle movement and allow comparisons to be drawn between data sets from the two species . to confirm that the different rates of image acquisition did not affect the velocity or displacement rate calculated for organelles in similar plant species high and low rates of image capture were compared in n.b. but no significant differences were found . figure shows the mean displacement rate and cumulative distribution frequency graphs that describe the distribution of displacement rates within a _LOCATION_ population in the presence of each truncated myosin fusion . comparisons between the two data sets from n.t . and from n.b . reveal that both tail and iq tail fusions of myosins _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ xi c xi e xi i and xi k significantly inhibited _LOCATION_ displacement rates in both plants . figure also shows that myosins xi b xi f xi h and _PROTEIN_ significantly interfered with _LOCATION_ movement only as tail fusions in n.t . but not as iq tail fusions in n.b . . in addition myosins xi g and _PROTEIN_ partially interfered with _LOCATION_ movement only as iq tail fusions in n.b . plants . in order to understand the origin of the differences obtained in the two _METHOD_ the tail fusions of myosins xi g _PROTEIN_ xi b xi f xi h and _PROTEIN_ were analyzed in n.b . figure shows that except for the _PROTEIN_ tail fusion all other tail fusions had a similar effect on _LOCATION_ body motility to the iq tail fusions in n.b . the tail fusion of _PROTEIN_ did not affect _LOCATION_ movement although its iq tail fragment did to some extent . importantly when iq tail mutants of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were _PROTEIN_ in n.t. they exhibited an inhibitory effect on _LOCATION_ body movement similar to their tail fusion counterparts in this plant . thus it _METHOD_ that the source of variability between the two _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ is the plant species itself and not an intrinsic difference in the myosin fragment fused to a _METHOD_ marker protein . next we addressed the question of whether myosin truncations specifically perturbed _LOCATION_ movement only or whether they affected other organelle classes . assessing the displacement rates of mitochondria in the presence of myosin iq tail mutants in n.b . showed that the same myosins that inhibited _LOCATION_ movement in the two _METHOD_ were able to arrest mitochondrial motility as well . the rest of the putative dominant negative mutants of myosins xi a xi b xi d xi f xi g xi h xi j _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ had no significant effect on the movement of mitochondria in n.b . leaves . the inhibitory iq tail myosin fusions did not specifically colocalize to _LOCATION_ or mitochondria in n.b . . to ensure that myosin truncated fragments are not nonspecifically interfering with actomyosin derived cytoplasmic streaming actin was labeled by the dsred marker and examined in the presence of each _METHOD_ iq tail myosin fusion in n.b . figure shows no detectable actin disruption in the presence of the six myosin mutants of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ myosin xi c xi e xi i and xi k. furthermore we compared the motility of myosin punctae of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ with _LOCATION_ body movement in the same time lapse movie acquired from n.b . while _LOCATION_ bodies are motionless in the presence of _METHOD_ iq tail the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ punctae are motile _LOCATION_ . some of the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ punctae moved in linear routes that may correspond to streaming in cytoplasmic strands . _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ spots can move without the motor domain because they are either bound to organelles or vesicles that move by other wild type active motor proteins or they are aggregates of the _METHOD_ chimera itself that are dragged along by cytoplasmic streaming . these data provide strong evidence that the myosin mutants are not arresting all cytoplasmic motion in the cells but are specifically inhibiting the motility of the tested _LOCATION_ and mitochondria .
