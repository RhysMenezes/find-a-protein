cellular _PROTEIN_ depletion in diverse cell types results in the net conversion of monomeric g actin to polymeric f actin and is an important aspect of cellular injury in tissue ischemia . we propose that this conversion results from altering the ratio of _PROTEIN_ g actin and adp g actin causing a net _PROTEIN_ in the concentration of thymosinactin complexes as a consequence of the differential affinity of thymosin for _PROTEIN_ and adp g actin . to test this hypothesis we examined the effect of _PROTEIN_ depletion induced by antimycin a and substrate depletion on actin polymerization the nucleotide state of the monomer pool and the association of actin monomers with thymosin and profilin in the kidney epithelial cell line llc _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ depletion for min increased f actin content to of the levels under physiological conditions accompanied by a corresponding _PROTEIN_ in g actin content . cytochalasin d treatment did not reduce f actin formation during _PROTEIN_ depletion indicating that it was predominantly not because of barbed end monomer addition . _PROTEIN_ g actin levels _PROTEIN_ rapidly during depletion but there was no change in the concentration of adp g actin monomers . the _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ g actin levels could be accounted for by dissociation of the thymosin g actin binary complex resulting in a rise in the concentration of free thymosin from to . increased detection of profilin actin complexes during depletion indicated that profilin may participate in catalyzing nucleotide exchange during depletion . this mechanism provides a biochemical basis for the accumulation of f actin aggregates in ischemic cells .
_PROTEIN_ depletion results in net conversion of g to f used _PROTEIN_ depletion in a clonal line of llc _PROTEIN_ cells as a model of ischemic injury . cells were treated with the mitochondrial cytochrome inhibitor antimycin a and with substrate depleted medium to eliminate both oxidative phosphorylation and glycolysis as sources of _PROTEIN_ . the intracellular _PROTEIN_ concentration fell rapidly in response to this treatment from control levels of to mm after min of depletion . the concentration of adp rose to a peak of mm at min of depletion _PROTEIN_ to mm at min . the ratio of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ fell from to by min and _PROTEIN_ further to by min of _PROTEIN_ depletion . to quantitatively assess the effect of depleting intracellular _PROTEIN_ on the actin _LOCATION_ we measured the fraction of filamentous and monomeric actin as a function of the duration of _PROTEIN_ depletion . total cellular f actin was determined by quantifying the binding of _METHOD_ phalloidin to fixed permeabilized cells and g actin was quantified based on its ability to inhibit the hydrolytic activity of dnase i . with _PROTEIN_ depletion times of up to min there was a roughly linear increase in the filamentous fraction of actin to a maximum level higher than that observed under physiological conditions . independent measurements documented a _PROTEIN_ in the monomeric fraction of actin to below the level under physiological conditions consistent with the increase in f actin . the total intracellular actin concentration measured by immunoblotting was whereas the base line g actin concentration was . therefore the alterations observed in g and f actin levels represent a _PROTEIN_ in monomeric actin from to with a corresponding increase in f actin from to values that are consistent within the _LOCATION_ in the data . continued _PROTEIN_ depletion beyond min did not result in further significant increases in the f actin content which remained at above base line after min of _PROTEIN_ depletion . we also measured the extent of f actin incorporation in a triton x insoluble fraction using high speed centrifugation to pellet large filaments or filaments cross linked into the bulk _LOCATION_ . the additional f actin formed after and min of depletion was incorporated into the triton insoluble material that was recovered in the high speed pellet . no significant additional incorporation into small oligomeric filaments was observed . actin polymerization triggered by _PROTEIN_ depletion was not the result of additional synthesis of actin monomers as cycloheximide treatment had no effect on f actin levels during depletion or recovery . as previously shown in our studies and by other investigators _PROTEIN_ depleted cells lost microvillar actin bundles and stress fibers and instead accumulated phalloidin staining aggregates throughout the cytoplasm particularly in the perinuclear area . to further explore the nature of the process leading to f actin formation in _PROTEIN_ depleted cells we incubated cells with the fungal toxin cytochalasin d to inhibit actin filament elongation by monomer addition onto filament barbed ends . surprisingly cytochalasin d had little effect on f actin accumulation during _PROTEIN_ depletion and in _PROTEIN_ resulted in significantly increased f actin accumulation after min of _PROTEIN_ depletion . we next sought to determine the energy level below which actin polymerization was initiated . to accomplish this we added back a range of _PROTEIN_ concentrations to the medium during min of antimycin a treatment . in the presence of antimycin a the intracellular _PROTEIN_ adp ratio varied linearly as a function of the _PROTEIN_ concentration over a range of _PROTEIN_ concentrations from to mg/liter . at _PROTEIN_ concentrations greater than mg/ml in which the _PROTEIN_ adp ratio was greater than there was no effect on f actin levels but at lower _PROTEIN_ concentrations in which the _PROTEIN_ adp ratio fell below _PROTEIN_ a progressive increase in f actin content was observed . the f actin content was a linear function of the _PROTEIN_ in the _PROTEIN_ adp ratio below as the _PROTEIN_ concentration was _PROTEIN_ from to mg/liter _PROTEIN_ . effect of _PROTEIN_ depletion on the nucleotide bound to the monomer determine the effect of _PROTEIN_ depletion on the nucleotide state of g actin we isolated unpolymerized g actin monomers by binding them to dnase i immobilized on beads and measured the fraction of _PROTEIN_ and adp associated with the monomers . we included latrunculin b and phalloidin in the isolation buffer to inhibit nucleotide exchange and polymerization or depolymerization during the isolation procedure . as previously noted the cellular concentration of g actin declined with _PROTEIN_ depletion from to in control cells after min of _PROTEIN_ depletion . there was a corresponding _PROTEIN_ in the concentration of _PROTEIN_ g actin . however the concentration of adp g actin remained essentially constant at approximately throughout the time course . role of monomer binding evaluate the potential importance of different classes of actin monomer binding proteins we measured their concentrations in the llc _PROTEIN_ cells used for these experiments . thymosin was present at high concentrations approaching the concentration of g actin in the cells under normal growth conditions . the concentration of profilin was much lower . as a comparison we measured the levels of these proteins as a fraction of the total soluble protein in llc _PROTEIN_ cells and in cortical tissue isolated from rat kidney . levels in isolated tubules were very similar to those found in the llc _PROTEIN_ cells confirming the physiological significance of our results for ischemic injury in the kidney . to quantitatively analyze the effect of _PROTEIN_ depletion on g actin association with sequestering proteins we used filters with a molecular weight cutoff of to separate the free fraction of thymosin from the fraction associated with g actin . in cells under normal growth conditions the concentration of free thymosin was rising to after min of _PROTEIN_ depletion . this corresponds to a release of all thymosin bound actin monomers in the first min of _PROTEIN_ depletion . we next compared the relative abundance of thymosin actin complexes by native gel electrophoresis using immunoblotting with anti actin antibodies to confirm the identity of the complexes observed . on native gels thymosin actin complexes migrate slightly ahead of free actin monomers probably because thymosin binding restricts the repertoire of conformations available to actin . on native gels of control cell extracts g actin migrated predominantly in the fast migrating thymosin bound fraction whereas in extracts from cells subjected to min of _PROTEIN_ depletion less g actin was detected and the electrophoretic mobility profile was characteristic of free actin monomers . we also used native gel electrophoresis to analyze the extent of actin monomer association with profilin . immunoblotting showed increased levels of profilin co migrating with actin monomer in extracts from cells depleted for min that was reversed by the addition of an _PROTEIN_ regenerating system to the extract .
cell clonal line of llc _PROTEIN_ cells was grown to confluence in dulbecco 's modified eagle 's medium with fetal bovine serum containing penicillin/streptomycin passaged once per week with trypsin/edta and seeded at a dilution . cultures typically reached confluence or days after seeding and experiments were performed h after confluence in or mm plates . chemicals and culture media were _PROTEIN_ from sigma unless otherwise noted . _PROTEIN_ were _PROTEIN_ depleted by incubating in depleted media _PROTEIN_ containing antimycin a for up to min as previously described . for experiments measuring the effect of variable cellular levels of _PROTEIN_ on actin polymerization cells were depleted in depletion media containing mg/liter _PROTEIN_ . in some experiments cells were incubated in cytochalasin d for min before depletion and during cellular _PROTEIN_ depletion . cellular g actin isolation in triton x soluble protein cells were extracted with of triton extraction buffer with _PROTEIN_ and mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride with latrunculin a and mg/ml phalloidin . two aliquots per plate of supernatant were spun through phem buffer equilibrated p spin columns to remove free nucleotides at g for min at . to isolate actin with its bound nucleotide we used immobilized dnase i . adenine nucleotide content was normalized to the protein present in each sample . cellular _PROTEIN_ and adp were determined by high performance liquid chromatography as previously described . cellular f actin actin content was measured by an _PROTEIN_ of the method of cano et al . for cells grown in a well plate . following treatment cells were aspirated fixed with paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffered saline for min at room temperature and stained for h with a solution containing _PROTEIN_ phalloidin diamidino phenylindole triton x in phem buffer . _METHOD_ was measured on a cytofluor ii _METHOD_ plate reader _METHOD_ at nm for actin phalloidin staining and nm for _LOCATION_ diamidino phenylindole staining . total and free cellular thymosin were extracted with triton extraction buffer as described above . free and actin bound were separated by centrifuging extracts through a microcon spin filter _METHOD_ for s at g. free thymosin was collected in the filtrate and thymosin bound to g actin remained in the retentate . total was isolated based on its stability against heat denaturation . was measured by densitometry methods against platelet standards . detection of and profilin by or denaturing gels were incubated in glutaraldehyde in phosphate buffered saline prior to transfer to polyvinylidene difluoride _LOCATION_ . rabbit anti igg _PROTEIN_ or rabbit anti human platelet profilin was used for immunodetection . detection of actin and profilin actin complexes by native gel extracts were subjected to native gel electrophoresis according to the method of safer . actin complexes were detected by the shift in migration of actin detected on immunoblots probed with the anti actin monoclonal antibody . profilin actin complexes were detected by immunoblotting for actin and profilin . rat renal proximal tubule isolation renal proximal tubules were isolated using an _PROTEIN_ of the method of weinberg . kidney cortex was sliced in sections incubated in a _PROTEIN_ gassed krebs _PROTEIN_ bicarbonate buffer with collagenase at for min and passed through a wire mesh strainer . the tubules were separated from glomeruli by percoll gradient . intracellular protein volume was estimated by subtracting the dilution ratio of mannitol from tritiated water after a min incubation with mannitol and labeled water . intracellular soluble protein concentration was calculated by dividing the supernatant protein per plate by the intracellular volume per plate .
