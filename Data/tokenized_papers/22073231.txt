the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ genes were identified as regulators of salt stress responses . the _PROTEIN_ protein is a _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ that positively affects _PROTEIN_ to salt stress . the _PROTEIN_ loss of function mutant displayed reduced survival rates under salt and high light stress . in contrast the _PROTEIN_ mutant defective in the _PROTEIN_ gene and _PROTEIN_ antisense plants exhibited enhanced survival under these conditions . we show here that the loss of _PROTEIN_ function results in abscisic acid overaccumulation reduced stomatal conductance and enhanced survival under drought stress . the _PROTEIN_ mutant displayed reduced stomatal aperture under all conditions tested . fusicoccin treatment exposition to increasing light intensities and supply of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ concentrations demonstrated full opening capacity of _PROTEIN_ stomata . reduced stomatal opening presumably is a consequence of elevated aba levels . furthermore seedling growth root growth and stomatal closure were hypersensitive to exogenous aba . the enhanced aba responses may contribute to the improved drought stress resistance of the mutant . three _PROTEIN_ splice variants were cloned and named _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ according to the molecular weight of the putative proteins . translational fusions to the green _METHOD_ protein suggest _LOCATION_ localisation of the _PROTEIN_ proteins . stable _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ splice variant in _PROTEIN_ plants largely complemented the mutant phenotype . our data show that _PROTEIN_ controls aba levels and suppresses aba responses . _PROTEIN_ may prevent unnecessary and costly stress _PROTEIN_ under favourable conditions .
screening of _PROTEIN_ libraries resulted in the identification of three _PROTEIN_ splice variants termed _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ according to the putative molecular weight of the encoded proteins . the _PROTEIN_ isoform differs only slightly in the c terminus from the previously identified _PROTEIN_ isoform . an bp intron corresponding to amino acids to of the _PROTEIN_ protein is removed in the _PROTEIN_ isoform . the n terminal primary structure of the _PROTEIN_ isoform is identical to the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ but alternative donor and acceptor sites account for sequence divergence of the c termini . the three putative _PROTEIN_ proteins show the characteristic features of nfxl proteins namely the n terminal _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ finger motif and the cys rich region . the length of the cys rich region of the _PROTEIN_ isoform is reduced in comparison to the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . the _PROTEIN_ protein comprises type zinc finger motifs the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ comprise type zinc finger motifs . a. exon intron structure and domain organisation of _PROTEIN_ proteins . exons are represented by boxes untranslated regions by _PROTEIN_ lines and introns by thin lines . t dna insertions in the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants are indicated . b. subcellular localisation of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ proteins . _METHOD_ _METHOD_ images and bright field images of roots of stably transformed arabidopsis plants . the scale bar represents . to determine whether _PROTEIN_ is imported into the _LOCATION_ a _METHOD_ _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ protein was stably _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis plants . green _METHOD_ was detectable in the _LOCATION_ of root cells . thus the _PROTEIN_ protein directs _METHOD_ to the _LOCATION_ . analysis of plants carrying the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ constructs suggests that the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ presumably are also _LOCATION_ proteins . web based _METHOD_ such as genevestigator and the arabidopsis _METHOD_ browser indicate the presence of relatively steady levels of _PROTEIN_ transcript in most tissues and cell types . transcript levels barely change under biotic and abiotic stress conditions upon treatment with elicitors and other chemicals and under different light and nutrient conditions . the _PROTEIN_ gene is comparably _PROTEIN_ in mesophyll cells and guard cells and is not controlled by aba and other phytohormones . since common _PROTEIN_ profiling _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ do not discriminate between the _PROTEIN_ splice variants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ transcript levels were determined in shoot material of well watered and drought stressed plants by means of quantitative rt pcr . transcript levels were not significantly different under both conditions . a . real time rt pcr analysis of _PROTEIN_ transcript levels in shoots of wild type plants . for drought treatment four week old soil grown plants were withheld from water for d. higher bars indicate higher transcript levels . a difference of one indicates a fold change of two . _LOCATION_ bars _PROTEIN_ of three technical replicates . b . real time rt pcr analysis of _PROTEIN_ transcript levels in shoots of four week old _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plants in comparison to the wild type and _PROTEIN_ mutant . wild type transcript levels were arbitrarily adjusted to a relative value . the _PROTEIN_ mutant is not able to produce the _PROTEIN_ mrnas . transcript levels of the transgenic lines were given relative to the wild type . higher bars indicate higher transcript levels . a difference of one indicates a fold change of two . _LOCATION_ bars _PROTEIN_ of three technical replicates . in a previous study the _PROTEIN_ loss of function mutant and _PROTEIN_ antisense lines showed higher survival rates under salt stress/high light conditions in comparison to the wild type . higher survival rates were accompanied by higher fv/fm ratios indicating less damage to the photosynthetic apparatus . these findings suggested that _PROTEIN_ suppresses salt stress responses . the _PROTEIN_ mutant showed only minor phenotypic changes under well watered conditions . the mutant had a tendency to early flowering the dry weight content was slightly increased but the mutant did not display obvious morphological alterations . an additional t dna insertion mutant was identified and termed _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants exhibited similar phenotypes . survival experiments were performed in order to test for drought stress resistance . plants were subjected to water withdrawal for seven days . the percentage of surviving plants was determined seven days _PROTEIN_ after water resupply . five independent experiments were performed . the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants grew significantly better than wild type plants . all _PROTEIN_ plants survived the drought period the survival rates of the _PROTEIN_ and wild type plants accounted for and respectively . water withdrawal for nine days with subsequent rehydration resulted in wilting of all wild type plants but approximately of the _PROTEIN_ plants survived and were still turgescent . a . week old soil grown plants were withheld from water for d. survival rates were determined d after water resupply . the number of surviving plants in five independent experiments is represented as the percentage of the number of total plants . mutant values denoted with an asterisk are significantly different from those of their wild type . b . for drought treatment week old soil grown plants were withheld from water for d. photos were taken d after water resupply . plants were arranged according to the visual phenotype . wild type plants were not able to survive the prolonged drought period but approximately of _PROTEIN_ plants were still turgescent and viable . the aba insensitive _PROTEIN_ mutant was used as stress sensitive control . it exhibited strong wilting and low survival rates . aba induced stomatal closing is impaired in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . water vapour flux at day of the drought experiment was clearly elevated . in contrast the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants showed significantly lower stomatal conductance . reduced stomatal conductance was associated with significantly higher leaf temperatures . these initial findings posed the question whether the _PROTEIN_ proteins control aba responses . a. stomatal conductance was determined with a decagon sc porometer at day of a drought stress experiment . data are given as . mutant values denoted with an asterisk are significantly different from those of their wild type .b . leaf temperature calculated from the quantification of infrared images . values denoted with an asterisk are significantly different from the wild type . stomatal aperture of well watered plants was determined microscopically under different environmental conditions . plants were grown in soil under long day conditions in a greenhouse or in a controlled growth chamber under ambient humidity or in a controlled growth chamber under high humidity or in synthetic medium in jars . the _PROTEIN_ mutant displayed significantly smaller stomatal aperture under all conditions . reduced stomatal aperture was most pronounced in growing leaves . in line with the reduced stomatal aperture stomatal conductance was reduced in plants grown in soil under long day conditions . fusicoccin treatments of epidermal peels revealed that _PROTEIN_ stomata were able to open as wide as wild type stomata suggesting that the cellular _METHOD_ for stomatal opening were intact . a. stomatal aperture was determined from images of silicone rubber imprints of the abaxial surfaces of rosette leaves of five week old plants . plants were grown in a greenhouse under standard conditions or in a controlled growth chamber . data are given as of at least stomata per genotype and condition . values denoted with an asterisk are significantly different from those of their wild type . b. stomatal conductance of rosette leaves of five week old plants was determined with a decagon sc porometer . plants were grown in a greenhouse under standard greenhouse conditions . data are given as . mutant values denoted with a positive sign are significantly different from their wild type . stomatal aperture was determined from images of silicone rubber imprints of the abaxial surfaces of rosette leaves or determined directly from epidermal peels using a microscope . data are given as of at least stomata per genotype and condition . mutant values denoted with an asterisk are significantly different from their wild type . a. stomatal aperture of d old plants grown in soil in a greenhouse under standard conditions . b. stomatal aperture of d old wild type and _PROTEIN_ plants grown in a controlled growth chamber at relative humidity . c. stomatal aperture of and d old plants grown in jars _METHOD_ . d. stomatal response to fusicoccin . epidermal peels were dissected from rosette leaves of soil grown plants and incubated for h in darkness either in stomata opening buffer or sob plus fusicoccin . light and _PROTEIN_ are key _PROTEIN_ in the control of stomatal movement . low atmospheric _PROTEIN_ concentrations and light induce stomatal opening high _PROTEIN_ concentrations and darkness cause stomatal closing . in the experiments depicted in photon flux density was increased sequentially from to . stomatal conductance of fully expanded rosette leaves of week old soil grown plants was determined by infrared gas exchange measurements . the _PROTEIN_ mutant exhibited less transpiration at but increasing pfds caused an elevated stomatal conductance . for example the increase in pfd from to caused increase of stomatal conductance in the wild type and increase in _PROTEIN_ plants . similarly to increasing pfd a _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ levels from to ppm resulted in an elevated stomatal conductance in the mutant . the _PROTEIN_ from to ppm _PROTEIN_ caused and increase of stomatal conductance in wild type and _PROTEIN_ plants respectively . these findings indicate that the _PROTEIN_ mutant is fully able to perceive and respond to light and _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ mutation did not cause a general defect in stomatal functioning but modified short term stomatal movements . although short term responses to light and _PROTEIN_ were altered the stomatal aperture under long term conditions was invariably reduced under all tested conditions . week old soil grown plants were investigated by gas exchange measurements . graphs represent conductance rates obtained during a stepwise change of pfd or _PROTEIN_ concentration . each data point represents the average of individual . the effect of exogenous aba on stomatal aperture was tested by application of synthetic aba to leaf petioles . stomata of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants exhibited a pronounced response to aba and were nearly fully closed after h treatment . percent change of stomatal aperture at the beginning and end of treatment was higher in both mutants in comparison to the wild type _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . the exaggerated aba induced stomatal closing may represent the physiological basis for reduced stomatal aperture under various conditions and contribute to the enhanced drought tolerance . the _PROTEIN_ mutant was grown in parallel and barely responded to aba . the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants also responded stronger to application of aba _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . a. stomatal aperture after aba application . stomatal aperture was determined from images of silicone rubber imprints of the abaxial surfaces of rosette leaves . three droplets of an aba solution were supplied to leave petioles . inset imprint of representative wild type and _PROTEIN_ stomata after h aba treatment .b . stomatal aperture after aba application . three droplets of an aba solution were supplied to leave petioles . details as in a.c. stomatal aperture after aba application . three droplets of an aba solution were supplied to leave petioles . further details as in a.d. cotyledon greening in the presence of exogenous aba . seeds were allowed to germinate on half concentrated _METHOD_ medium supplemented with sucrose at . d old seedlings were transferred to the same medium supplemented with and aba and cultured at with h light h dark photoperiod . after d the percentage of seedlings with green cotyledons was scored . values denoted with an asterisk are significantly different from that of their wild type .e . d old seedlings were transferred to half concentrated _METHOD_ medium supplemented with sucrose and and aba . root length of d old plants was determined and is given as percentage of control plants . values denoted with an or are significantly different from that of their wild type . the enhanced response of _PROTEIN_ stomata towards exogenous aba prompted the analyses of additional aba responses . first inhibition of seed germination was tested by supplementation of to aba to synthetic medium . aba dose response curves of wild type and _PROTEIN_ plants were similar . thus the loss of _PROTEIN_ did not affect aba sensitivity of seed germination under the tested conditions . second postgerminative growth was tested by scoring cotyledon greening in the presence of aba . and of wild type seedlings showed cotyledon greening in the presence of and aba respectively whereas and of the _PROTEIN_ seedlings developed green cotyledons under these conditions . third root elongation was tested in the presence of and aba . the _PROTEIN_ mutant displayed approximately less root growth in the presence of aba compared with the wild type . thus _PROTEIN_ suppresses several aba responses . aba levels were determined in plant material grown in a greenhouse under well watered or drought conditions . under standard greenhouse conditions four week old wild type _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ plants accumulated and ng aba per gram fresh weight respectively . drought stress caused a and fold increase of aba levels in wild type _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ plants respectively . thus the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ plants accumulated and more aba under drought stress in comparison to the wild type . a . for drought treatment soil grown plants were withheld from water for d. two independent experiments were analyzed . results are mean ng aba per gram fresh . values denoted with an are significantly different from that of their wild type .b . rosette leaves were infiltrated with diamino benzidine . formation of brown polymerisation product indicates formation . plants were grown in parallel to the plants used in a . supplemental data are given in . water stress also induces accumulation of reactive oxygen species such as . ros can exacerbate cellular damage during stress but also function as signalling compounds in plants . ros modify the activity of protein kinases transcription _PROTEIN_ and channels . production of was imaged in rosette leaves of drought stressed plants . the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants displayed stronger staining in comparison to the wild type under mild drought stress conditions . thus the loss of _PROTEIN_ enhanced production . water withdrawal for d resulted in _METHOD_ production in all genotypes . introduction of the _PROTEIN_ coding sequence under control of the promoter into the _PROTEIN_ mutant resulted in the specific _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ mrna . the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mrnas were absent in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ lines . stomatal aperture was increased in comparison to the mutant under favourable growth conditions stomatal conductance was increased to the wild type level under drought stress aba sensitivity of stomata cotyledons and roots was lower in comparison to the mutant dry weight content survival rate after drought stress aba content and levels were reduced to the wild type level . thus the _PROTEIN_ protein largely complemented the mutant phenotype . stable introduction of the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ coding sequences into the _PROTEIN_ mutant _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ resulted in the _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mrnas respectively . thus the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ sequences allowed formation of the transcripts of two and three _METHOD_ respectively . this is a consequence of the presence of the corresponding donor and acceptor splice sites . the _PROTEIN_ protein presumably can act both synergistically and antagonistically to _PROTEIN_ in aba responses . for example simultaneous _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mrnas caused aba hyposensitivity of stomata but aba hypersensitivity in the cotyledon greening assay . the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plants were hyposensitive to exogenous aba . however future analyses of the specific functions of the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ will require mutagenesis of the donor and acceptor splice sites in the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ coding sequences in order to allow specific _PROTEIN_ of the single mrnas .
the gabi kat line carries a t dna insertion in an _PROTEIN_ intron and was named _PROTEIN_ . the dna insertion site was confirmed by sequencing . homozygosity of t dna insertions was confirmed by pcr on genomic dna using t dna border specific and gene specific primers . the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ coding sequences were amplified using the primers _PROTEIN_ fw cac cat gac taa _PROTEIN_ ggc cgg aac cg _PROTEIN_ rev tta aca ccg _PROTEIN_ cag cca _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ g and _PROTEIN_ rev tta _PROTEIN_ tcg _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ tct tct _PROTEIN_ c . the pcr fragments were cloned into the pentr/d topo vector and used to establish _METHOD_ fusion constructs using the vector . the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ sequences were also inserted into the vector for _PROTEIN_ under control of the promoter . sequence analysis of all cloned pcr products revealed identity to the respective cdna sequence . all constructs were transformed into arabidopsis plants using the floral dip method . plants were established in soil . seeds were allowed to germinate and grew for two weeks in controlled growth chambers . subsequently plants were transferred to long day conditions in a greenhouse with artificial light or to specific conditions as indicated in the text . all genotypes were grown side by side in a randomized manner . alternatively plants were grown under aseptic conditions as described before . for aba induction a few droplets of or aba dissolved in stomata opening buffer were added to the petioles of fully expanded rosette leaves . the _PROTEIN_ transcripts could not be detected by means of northern blot analysis and were analyzed by rt pcr as described . sequences of primers used for rt pcr analysis were as follows _PROTEIN_ fw aag gcg cgc tcc tcc ctt _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ rev cac cga ttc _PROTEIN_ cac ctg ta _PROTEIN_ fw ccg tgg acc _PROTEIN_ tca cag aaa _PROTEIN_ rev cga aca acc acc ttt tta cca ca _PROTEIN_ fw _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ cca ttt ggg _PROTEIN_ ctg _PROTEIN_ ct and _PROTEIN_ rev gca _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ gcc act aa . the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ genes were used to normalize the _PROTEIN_ levels . sequences of primers were as follows fw _PROTEIN_ aca ggc _PROTEIN_ ctg _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ rev cag cgt cac cat tct tca aaa a _PROTEIN_ fw acg tcg cta aag tac ttc _PROTEIN_ ccc _PROTEIN_ rev cga _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ ttc tcc aca acc g _PROTEIN_ fw _PROTEIN_ ggc _PROTEIN_ tga cga gga tgc _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ rev cgt cgt tca ccc _PROTEIN_ caa cat gag . the amplification efficiency of each pcr was computed with the linregpcr software and was used to correct the readout for each primer pair and run . aba extraction was done at with dimmed light . mg powdered tissue were subjected to lyophilisation for h. tissue was suspended in ml extraction buffer . the extract was incubated for at least h in the dark at under shaking conditions and centrifuged at for min at . the supernatants were recovered and ml extraction meoh was added . sep pak cartridges were equilibrated with ml extraction buffer and subsequently with ml extraction meoh . supernatants were passed through a sep pak cartridge . ml meoh was loaded onto the cartridge and flow throughs were united . additional elutions were analyzed exemplarily to check for residual aba on the cartridge . the eluates were dried in a lyophilizer . dried samples were resuspended in ml mm tris buffered saline ph /meoh . dilutions in tbs of each sample extract or aba standard were subjected to analysis by an enzyme immunoassay using the _PROTEIN_ kit according to the manufacturer instruction . the aba standard was assumed to be a mixture of equal amounts of the cis and trans form of aba . the production of was imaged in plant material infiltrated with diaminobenzidine . a method described in was used for quantitative measurements . _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was visualized in roots of day old transgenic plants grown in sterile media using a leica tcs confocal microscope . stomatal aperture width was determined by light microscopy of nail polish images from silicone rubber imprints of abaxial surfaces of rosette leaves as described in . alternatively epidermal peels were prepared from week old plants grown in a greenhouse mounted on a microscope slide and analyzed by light microscopy . stomatal conductance of rosette leaves was determined abaxially using the decagon sc porometer after adjusting the clamp pressure of the sensor head to measurements with arabidopsis according to the manufacturer s instructions . infrared gas exchange measurements were performed as described before . fusicoccin was added to sob and applied to epidermal peels . leaf temperature was measured by an infrared thermal imaging camera _PROTEIN_ . images were recorded online by application of the irbis thermography software .
