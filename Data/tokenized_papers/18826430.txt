nitrate is an essential nutrient and is involved in many _PROTEIN_ responses of plants such as localized proliferation of roots flowering or stomatal movements . how such nitrate specific _METHOD_ are regulated at the molecular level is poorly understood . although the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ transcription _PROTEIN_ appears to control stimulation of _PROTEIN_ root elongation in response to nitrate no regulators of nitrate assimilation have so far been identified in higher plants . legume specific symbiotic nitrogen fixation is under the control of the putative transcription _PROTEIN_ nin in lotus japonicus . recently the algal homologue _PROTEIN_ was found to regulate nitrate assimilation . here we report that arabidopsis thaliana nin like protein _PROTEIN_ knockout mutants constitutively show several features of nitrogen starved plants and that they are tolerant to drought stress . we show that _PROTEIN_ mutants are impaired in transduction of the nitrate signal and that the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ pattern is consistent with a function of _PROTEIN_ in the sensing of nitrogen . translational fusions with _METHOD_ showed a _LOCATION_ localization for the _PROTEIN_ putative transcription _PROTEIN_ . we propose _PROTEIN_ as an important element of the nitrate signal transduction pathway and as a new regulatory protein specific for nitrogen assimilation in non nodulating plants .
to investigate the function of the atnlp proteins a systematic screen of t dna insertion mutants for most genes of the atnlp family was undertaken . preliminary studies revealed a visible phenotype for two homozygous allelic mutants of the _PROTEIN_ gene _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . we therefore focused on the _PROTEIN_ gene and further investigated the physiological impact of loss of function of _PROTEIN_ . no _PROTEIN_ mrna and only of the wild type _PROTEIN_ mrna level were found in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ respectively . the _PROTEIN_ mutants developed a smaller rosette compared to the wild type especially when grown on full nutrient supply but the root fresh weight was not modified . as a consequence the shoot to root fresh weight ratio an important marker for nutrient starvation was lower for the _PROTEIN_ mutants grown hydroponically on mm nitrate . moreover mutants showed delayed growth and flowering when grown in the greenhouse . in addition _PROTEIN_ mutants grown on nutrient rich agar plates developed a longer primary root and had a higher _PROTEIN_ root density compared to wild type whereas the root architecture was identical for wild type and mutant plants grown on n p or s free agar plates . the allelic mutant _PROTEIN_ has a slightly less severe phenotype than _PROTEIN_ . the t dna insertion in _PROTEIN_ is in the last exon of the _PROTEIN_ gene which may give rise to a small amount of protein truncated only by the last few amino acids including the _PROTEIN_ protein binding site . we have isolated a third knockout mutant _PROTEIN_ which has a t dna insertion in the first intron and shows the same severe phenotype as _PROTEIN_ mutant . to identify which processes are deregulated in _PROTEIN_ mutants we performed transcriptome analyses on _PROTEIN_ and wild type plants grown hydroponically under low n conditions . growth of wild type plants is slightly limited under these conditions but no n starvation arises as the nutrient solution is replaced regularly . developmental defects of the _PROTEIN_ mutant were less pronounced under these conditions which allowed us to study changes in gene _PROTEIN_ directly related to the mutation . around genes were differentially _PROTEIN_ in the mutant compared to the wild type under these conditions and most of them were downregulated in the mutant . however only genes had more than a twofold modified _PROTEIN_ and of them were specifically deregulated in the roots of the mutant . comparing these data to the transcriptome data for wild type plants starved for nitrogen _PROTEIN_ it was obvious that many marker genes for n starvation had modified _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ roots . the left panel of figure shows the _PROTEIN_ level of selected genes that are downregulated by n starvation in wild type plants . these genes also show lower _PROTEIN_ in roots of the mutant compared to the wild type even in the presence of n. similarly eight genes that are upregulated by n starvation in the wild type are upregulated even in the presence of n in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . marker genes for sulphate and phosphate starvation that are either up or downregulated in wild type plants showed no obvious _PROTEIN_ changes relative to wild type plants in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . the _PROTEIN_ that only _PROTEIN_ of marker genes for n starvation was modified in the _PROTEIN_ mutant reinforced our hypothesis that the mutant phenotype is a constitutive response to n starvation . however the total gene _PROTEIN_ pattern of the mutant did not match perfectly the pattern of a wild type n starved plant . although of the genes that are induced in _PROTEIN_ roots are also induced by n starvation in the wild type only of the genes repressed in the roots of the mutants are also repressed by n starvation . this indicates that only specific parts of the response to n starvation are modified in the _PROTEIN_ mutants . we analyzed nitrate assimilation and the nitrate responsiveness of _PROTEIN_ mutants in order to determine the origin of the mutant s n starved like phenotype . nitrate content was increased in the mutants but high affinity nitrate uptake and total amino acid content were slightly lower . however no changes occurred in the pattern of individual amino acids . these results led us to investigate the enzymatic activity of key enzymes of the nitrate assimilation pathway . the nitrate reductase and glutamine synthetase enzyme activities were two to three times lower in the mutants compared to the wild type which could explain nitrate accumulation and lower levels of amino acids . however the percentage of total n remained unchanged in the _PROTEIN_ mutants indicating that their physiological status was not reminiscent of n starvation per se . the mutants were therefore not nitrogen starved but seem to respond to n starvation signals . data are means standard deviation of four individual plants . the responses of the _PROTEIN_ mutants to nitrate were studied by following steady state amounts of root transcripts for four known nitrate responsive genes _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ after re supply of nitrate to n starved plants in hydroponic culture . the wild type and the mutants had a similar _PROTEIN_ level for these genes after a short period of n starvation . however the _PROTEIN_ pattern after re supply of nitrate was different in the _PROTEIN_ mutants when compared to the wild type . in the wild type all four genes were highly induced by nitrate supply but the induction was much lower in the _PROTEIN_ mutants especially after h of induction . at this time point _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ levels in _PROTEIN_ were and lower than in the wild type respectively . a similar reduction was observed for the _PROTEIN_ mutant . the induction of the nitrate transporter genes _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ was also impaired in the _PROTEIN_ mutants . compared to the wild type _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was two times lower in the _PROTEIN_ mutants and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was reduced by and in the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants respectively . using quantitative rt pcr we have shown that the _PROTEIN_ gene is _PROTEIN_ in all plant organs but chiefly in roots . we studied tissue specific _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ using in situ mrna and whole mount hybridization . _PROTEIN_ mrna was detected in root hairs and emerging secondary roots . _PROTEIN_ rna was also detected in vascular tissue of _METHOD_ close to the xylem . these results were confirmed by _PROTEIN_ of the gus reporter gene under the control of the _PROTEIN_ promoter which was detected in the root tip and vascular tissue and to a lesser extent in whole roots and root hairs leaf parenchyma cells and stomata . taken together the _PROTEIN_ gene is highly _PROTEIN_ in tissues or cells that are involved in transport and sensing of nutrients and assimilates . nlps have been described as putative transcription _PROTEIN_ with bipartite like _LOCATION_ localization signals . up to now however no proof of _LOCATION_ localization has been obtained for proteins of this gene family . to investigate the subcellular localization of the _PROTEIN_ protein we cloned the _PROTEIN_ cdna in frame with the _METHOD_ reporter gene at either the c or n terminal position _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . these constructs permitted the localization of _PROTEIN_ by transient _PROTEIN_ and generation of stable lines _PROTEIN_ the corresponding fusion proteins . both constructs restored the wild type phenotype when _PROTEIN_ in the _PROTEIN_ mutant genetic background which indicates that the fusion proteins are correctly processed and are functional in planta . using both transient and stable _PROTEIN_ we showed that _PROTEIN_ is indeed located in the _LOCATION_ which is in agreement with the function of a transcriptional regulator . in addition to the clear _LOCATION_ staining slight _METHOD_ _METHOD_ also occurred in the _LOCATION_ . these results were confirmed using the kb _PROTEIN_ promoter region in front of the fusion proteins instead of the promoter . the gus staining observed in the guard cells of the gus lines led us to further investigate the involvement of _PROTEIN_ in stomatal function . we therefore performed water loss experiments on both detached leaves and whole _PROTEIN_ and wild type plants . interestingly water loss form excised leaves was slower for the _PROTEIN_ mutant compared to the wild type . moreover _PROTEIN_ mutant plants subjected to drought stress for days showed less damage than the wild type and were able to recover after days of water re supply whereas the wild type could not . these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ may play a role in stomatal movements and drought resistance .
the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ lines were obtained from a nottingham arabidopsis stock centre t dna mutagenized population of the col arabidopsis ecotype . homozygous mutant plants were identified by pcr using the primers listed in table . transgenic plants carrying _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ constructs or a kb _PROTEIN_ promoter fused to the gus reporter gene were obtained by floral dipping of col arabidopsis plants after cloning into gateway technology compatible and plasmids respectively . plants were grown for days in hydroponic culture on limiting or non limiting nitrate supply . the solutions were changed three times per week during the first weeks of the culture and then changed daily . for nitrate induction experiments mutant and wild type plants were grown under the same conditions for days on mm supply starved for days and re supplied with mm for or min . plants were harvested h after the start of the light period and immediately frozen in liquid . plants were grown in vitro for days on vertical agar plates containing either mm nitrate or no nitrogen . for the medium without nitrogen the ion balance was adjusted by adding kcl and . the culture was performed at under long day conditions with a light intensity of . the plates were photographed and the primary root length and _PROTEIN_ root number were determined using photolite software . _PROTEIN_ and wild type plants were grown in the greenhouse for days . water loss from excised leaves was measured by weighing leaves placed under a laminar air flow . for drought resistance experiments plants were grown for days on soil in the greenhouse drought stressed for days and then re supplied with nutrient solution for days . plants were grown in hydroponic culture as described above . after ethanolic extraction nitrate and amino acid contents were determined in leaf and root samples . a further aliquot of the same frozen plant material was used for determination of the maximum in vitro activities of nitrate reductase and glutamine synthetase . means and standard _LOCATION_ were calculated from three biological repetitions of three plants each . total rnas were isolated from shoots and roots using trizol reagent according to the manufacturer s protocols . microarray analysis was performed using the complete arabidopsis transcriptome micro array array containing gene specific tags from arabidopsis thaliana . rna samples from two independent biological replicates were used for each comparison with dye swap technical replicates . the labelling hybridizations and scanning were performed as described previously . the statistical analysis was based on two dye swaps . to determine differentially _PROTEIN_ genes we performed a paired t test on the log ratios assuming that the variance of the log ratios was the same for all genes . the raw p values were adjusted by the bonferroni method which controls the family wise _LOCATION_ rate . genes with a family wise _LOCATION_ rate of were considered as differentially _PROTEIN_ . using the bonferroni method _LOCATION_ avoids false positives in a multiple comparison context . reverse transcription reactions and quantitative pcr were performed as described by citation . results are given as a percentage of the _PROTEIN_ of the gene which was used as a constitutive reference . transgenic plants carrying a gus construct were grown on horizontal plates for days at under long day conditions with relative humidity and with a light intensity of . the plantlets were observed under a light microscope after gus staining . transgenic plants carrying a _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ construct were grown on horizontal plates on standard culture medium for days at under long day conditions with relative humidity and a light intensity of . the _METHOD_ was observed using a tcs _PROTEIN_ confocal microscope _METHOD_ . the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ plasmids used to obtain stable arabidopsis transformants were introduced into arabidopsis cell suspension protoplasts by polyethylene glycol mediated transformation . confocal laser scanning microscopy using a tcs _PROTEIN_ confocal microscope was performed h after transformation . a bp dna template for the antisense rna probe was produced by pcr using the oligonucleotides listed in table . dioxygenin labelling of the rna probe tissue preparation and in situ hybridization were performed as described previously . whole mount hybridization of _PROTEIN_ mrna was performed using the same probe . the coloration was observed under a light microscope .
