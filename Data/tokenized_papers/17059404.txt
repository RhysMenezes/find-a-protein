the arabidopsis radial swelling mutant _PROTEIN_ showed ballooning of root trichoblasts a lower than wild type level of cellulose and altered levels of some monosaccharides in non cellulosic polysaccharides . map based cloning showed that the mutated gene encodes a ribose phosphate isomerase and that the _PROTEIN_ mutation replaces a conserved glutamic acid residue with lysine . although rpi is intimately involved with many biochemical pathways media supplementation experiments suggest that the visible phenotype results from a defect in the production of pyrimidine based sugar nucleotide compounds most likely uridine diphosphate _PROTEIN_ the presumed substrate of cellulose synthase . two of three rpi sequences in the _LOCATION_ genome are cytoplasmic while the third has a putative chloroplast transit sequence . the sequence encoding both cytoplasmic enzymes could complement the mutation when _PROTEIN_ behind the camv promoter while fusion of the _PROTEIN_ promoter region to the gus reporter gene established that the gene is _PROTEIN_ in many aerial tissues as well as the roots . the prominence of the _PROTEIN_ phenotype in roots probably reflects _PROTEIN_ being the only _LOCATION_ rpi in this tissue and the gene encoding the _LOCATION_ rpi being relatively weakly _PROTEIN_ . we could not however detect a _PROTEIN_ in total rpi activity in root extracts . the _PROTEIN_ phenotype is prominent near the root tip where cells undergo division endoreduplication and cell expansion and so are susceptible to a restriction in de novo pyrimidine production . the two _LOCATION_ rpis probably arose in an ancient duplication event their present _PROTEIN_ patterns representing subfunctionalization of the _PROTEIN_ of the original ancestral gene .
the _PROTEIN_ phenotype is pronounced in seedlings especially after the transfer of plants initially grown at to the elevated temperature of but is not obvious in mature plants . roots of _PROTEIN_ and wild type seedlings have a nearly identical diameter after days at but after transfer to _PROTEIN_ progressively increases in diameter between days and . these increases in diameter in _PROTEIN_ are statistically highly significant but smaller than those produced by the temperature sensitive allele of _PROTEIN_ ii in _PROTEIN_ and much smaller than those produced by the _PROTEIN_ allele of the _PROTEIN_ glycosyltransferase . they _PROTEIN_ arise from bulging of epidermal cells largely in trichoblast cell files a phenotype reminiscent of _PROTEIN_ with its mutation in an allele of udp _PROTEIN_ epimerase . with longer periods at root elongation and the elongation zone itself are drastically reduced . bulging cells are seen progressively closer to the root tip until after days at root hairs emerge in the region that would formerly have been the meristem . hypocotyl swelling in _PROTEIN_ is constitutive in seedlings grown for days at in the dark _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and this swelling is slightly increased by growth for only days at then transfer to for a further days _PROTEIN_ . unlike roots there is no prominent bulging of cells in the hypocotyl but rather a general swelling of the sort seen with cellulose deficient mutants . the phenotype in mature aerial parts of the plant is modest . stem regrowth in _PROTEIN_ was reduced at and transfer to did not produce further inhibition . _PROTEIN_ flowers appeared morphologically normal and fully fertile as did both leaves and trichromes . the mutated gene was located on the lower arm of chromosome by analysing an mapping population with cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence markers distributed over the arabidopsis genome . further caps mapping placed the gene first in a mb region between markers and and then to a region of approximately kb contained on the two overlapping bacterial artificial chromosomes and . assessment of complementation by bac derived cosmid clones forming a contig spanning this region placed the mutation in a region occupied by four annotated genes . sequencing each gene showed only one mutation a g to a replacement in the coding region of _GENE_ an open reading frame which has no predicted introns and encodes a protein with a predicted mr of . the resultant _PROTEIN_ amino acid change substitutes a negatively charged residue with a positively charged one in the sequence of a putative rpi an enzyme catalysing the interconversion of ribose phosphate and ribulose phosphate in both the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway and in the reductive pentose phosphate pathway . confirmation that the gene _GENE_ was indeed mutated in _PROTEIN_ was provided by complementation of the mutant phenotype with a clone containing only this gene and bp of sequence upstream from the start codon . when rpi activity in root extracts was assayed however there was no significant difference in activity in _PROTEIN_ and wild type after days of growth at . this held whether the assay itself was conducted at _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . when we consider how a mutation in rpi might affect metabolism in the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway one molecule of _PROTEIN_ phosphate is converted through three successive reactions to with the concurrent generation of two molecules of the reducing agent nadph . ribulose phosphate is then converted to by rpi and to xylulose phosphate by an epimerase enzyme . transaldolase and transketolase enzymes then convert these two compounds to fructose phosphate and glyceraldehyde phosphate both of which can be utilized in glycolysis . however also serves as a precursor via _LOCATION_ phosphate of the aromatic amino acids and after conversion to phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate it _METHOD_ the backbone of both purine and pyrimidine nucleotides histidine and the nad/nadp coenzymes . therefore the metabolic consequences of any rpi mutation potentially reach into many areas of metabolism . the radial swelling phenotype of _PROTEIN_ strongly suggested a defect in cell wall biosynthesis particularly given the close resemblance to the _PROTEIN_ phenotype where cell wall polysaccharide composition is altered . we therefore analysed the yield of monosaccharides from cellulosic and non cellulosic polysaccharides using a cell wall fraction prepared from whole seedlings grown for days at and days at . the results showed a reduction in cellulosic _PROTEIN_ in the mutant whereas the _PROTEIN_ polysaccharides showed a small reduction in fucose increases in arabinose and to a lesser degree xylose and no significant change in the levels of rhamnose mannose or galactose . as _PROTEIN_ was characterized by a significant reduction in cellulose and the phenotype of the hypocotyl resembled that observed in other cellulose deficient mutants we focused on how a defective rpi could change the quantity of this polymer . the most obvious link appeared to be through the activated sugar udp _PROTEIN_ which is believed to be the substrate donor of _PROTEIN_ residues for the growing cellulose chain . uridine diphosphate _PROTEIN_ can be formed by either the activity of sucrose synthase or udp _PROTEIN_ pyrophosphorylase the former utilizing udp the latter utp . all uridine nucleotides are ultimately metabolic products from the activity of rpi although efficient salvage pathways exist to ensure that nucleosides are reused . as such we tested the importance of nucleotide supply in generating the visible phenotype by supplementing the growth medium with the nucleosides uridine and inosine which were favoured because they are expected to enter cells via equilibrative nucleoside transporters and be metabolized by the purine and pyrimidine salvage pathways . uridine and inosine kinases and nucleoside phosphotransferases are expected to convert the respective nucleosides to nucleoside monophosphates and hence to the other nucleotide derivatives . root elongation and swelling was measured in seedlings of the radial swelling mutants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . seedlings were grown at for days and then transferred to media supplemented with either uridine and/or inosine for days at . uridine only suppressed the mutant root phenotype of _PROTEIN_ but not the phenotypes of _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ . for unknown reasons uridine had a slightly inhibitory effect on growth . epidermal bulging was almost completely suppressed in _PROTEIN_ . medium was also supplemented with udp _PROTEIN_ but here suppression of the _PROTEIN_ phenotype was less complete a situation that was not improved by raising the concentration in the medium to or mm . this less complete rescue may reflect two _PROTEIN_ . first inefficient transfer of this metabolite across the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ compared to the transfer of uridine via equilibrative nucleoside transporters . secondly each uridine entering the cell can be converted to udp _PROTEIN_ and donate numerous _PROTEIN_ residues as it is regenerated so minimizing any advantage enjoyed by udp _PROTEIN_ directly entering the cell . the failure of uridine to even partially rescue the phenotypes of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ implies both that it does not provide a general stimulus for elongation growth at the expense of radial growth and that of the mutants tested only _PROTEIN_ is limited in the production of this compound and/or its derivatives . the strong similarity between the visual phenotypes of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and their rescue by exogenous galactose and uridine respectively led us to test both mutants on media containing either galactose or uridine . galactose rescued _PROTEIN_ but not _PROTEIN_ whereas uridine rescued _PROTEIN_ but not _PROTEIN_ . hence despite the similar trichoblast swelling in the two mutants and the _PROTEIN_ that udp _PROTEIN_ is a substrate of the _PROTEIN_ udp _PROTEIN_ epimerase the metabolic origin of their respective phenotypes is distinct as reflected in their differing response to medium supplementation . arabidopsis has three _LOCATION_ genes which putatively encode rpis _GENE_ _GENE_ and _GENE_ . analysis by targetp and psort suggests that the first two predicted proteins lack transit peptide sequences consistent with _LOCATION_ locations . the third has a sequence with a presumptive n terminal chloroplast transit peptide and is probably the enzyme associated with the calvin cycle . a fourth gene _GENE_ has some similarity with these proteins but as it appears to lack the amino acids critical for activity it probably catalyses a different biochemical reaction . the predicted _LOCATION_ locations of the _GENE_ and _GENE_ proteins were confirmed by the fusion of each to the n terminus of green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ . in each case the recombinant _METHOD_ protein localized to the cytoplasm a pattern identical to that observed with yellow _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ lacking any organelle targeting sequences . the functional activity of the _GENE_ rpi _METHOD_ fusion protein was confirmed by its ability to complement the _PROTEIN_ mutant phenotype . the development of a phenotype in _PROTEIN_ shows that the _GENE_ gene product either catalyses a different reaction to the _GENE_ _PROTEIN_ gene product or that the activity of the enzyme encoded by _GENE_ is quantitatively insufficient to meet the plant 's requirements on its own or that the genes have entirely different spatial and/or temporal modes of _PROTEIN_ . to examine the first alternative we cloned separately the coding sequences of both _GENE_ and _GENE_ into vectors such that they were _PROTEIN_ by the constitutively active camv promoter and then transformed these into the _PROTEIN_ background . both constructs suppressed the root phenotype of the mutant showing that the phenotype developed when the _GENE_ gene product is defective in _PROTEIN_ is not due to _GENE_ encoding a protein catalysing a different reaction but rather that its activity in roots is inadequate after the mutation of _GENE_ . we therefore examined the _PROTEIN_ of the three arabidopsis rpi genes through the _METHOD_ parallel signature sequencing _PROTEIN_ global _PROTEIN_ data . _GENE_ _PROTEIN_ is transcribed in roots leaves and young seedlings and to a minor degree in inflorescences and siliques while _GENE_ is active in leaves floral tissues and siliques but significantly not in roots or seedlings where the _PROTEIN_ phenotype is strong . _GENE_ encoding is _PROTEIN_ quite strongly in all tissues but particularly in siliques leaves and seedlings . to look in more detail at the _PROTEIN_ pattern of _GENE_ _PROTEIN_ we cloned the promoter region of this gene in front of the uid reporter gene producing the construct _GENE_ gus which was transformed into arabidopsis . histochemical staining of tissues in transgenic seedlings showed that the _GENE_ promoter was active in the cotyledons lower hypocotyls and roots . near the root tip _PROTEIN_ was limited to cells towards the distal end of the elongation zone corresponding to the approximate region where trichoblast and general root swelling occurred in _PROTEIN_ . behind the elongation zone there was _PROTEIN_ in epidermis and cortex and strong staining in the vascular tissue and young _PROTEIN_ roots until with further extension they came to resemble the primary root in having no _PROTEIN_ near the tip . in week old _GENE_ gus plants gus activity was observed in the rosette leaves while in mature flowers _PROTEIN_ was observed in the anthers and stigma and the vascular tissue of the sepals _PROTEIN_ and stamens . the strong _PROTEIN_ in flowers contrasts with the low level of activity of _GENE_ in the whole inflorescence as indicated by the _PROTEIN_ data . finally we examined the possible evolutionary origin of the two _LOCATION_ rpis . analysis of the complete sequence of the arabidopsis genome has revealed that it is probably the product of a number of rounds of polyploidy each event being followed by rearrangement of chromosomal segments and selective gene loss . in particular there appears to have been a major whole genome duplication event between the divergence of the arabidopsis lineage from the leguminosae and the subsequent arabidopsis brassica split . analysis of the duplicated blocks of the arabidopsis genome suggested by the citation failed to show that the two _LOCATION_ rpi genes were part of any annotated region of duplication . however examination of the blocks proposed by a more recent study in which one set is believed to represent the single major genome duplication event prior to the arabidopsis brassica split and a second set the earlier duplication events places the two rpi genes in the latter category implying that they originate from an ancient duplication event . genbank searches identified sequences of presumptive brassica oleracea orthologues of both _GENE_ and _GENE_ but it was not possible to identify orthologues in any other species . the contrasting _PROTEIN_ patterns of _GENE_ and _GENE_ suggest that these rpi genes may provide an example of subfunctionalization where two genes arising by duplication acquire independent subfunctions of the original single gene with both being required to reproduce the ancestral _PROTEIN_ pattern .
the _PROTEIN_ mutant was obtained by screening ethyl methane sulphonate mutagenized seed of a. thaliana ecotype columbia as described for _PROTEIN_ and other mutants . the molecular lesions in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ have been described . general conditions for plant growth and analysis of morphology were as described . root diameters were measured between bulging trichoblast cells so reflecting underlying cell swelling . stem growth was measured after cutting off newly emerged primary bolts on plants grown at and following the growth of secondary _METHOD_ at either or . transformation by floral dipping used constructs transformed into the agrobacterium tumefaciens _PROTEIN_ strain via electroporation . standard dna manipulations were performed essentially following citation . sequencing used an abi machine _METHOD_ with the big dye _METHOD_ dye _PROTEIN_ of the dideoxy chain terminator method . the dna sequences were assembled with the assemblylign program . protein sequences were analysed for putative transit peptides with targetp and psort . initial mapping of a population from a cross with the landsberg _LOCATION_ ecotype used pooled dna isolated with the fast dna kit and the genome wide markers described by citation . further mapping used dna from individual plants and caps markers acquired from the tair database or established in this laboratory by multiple restriction enzyme digestion of pcr amplified fragments . a cosmid library for the bacs and was constructed by partial taqi digestion and ligation of fragments into the clai site of the binary vector a derivative of carrying a spectomycin resistance gene for selection in bacteria . partially digested bac dna was size selected to be in the kb range by pilot digestions with differing quantities of enzyme over a defined time period and purified on a sucrose gradient . end sequencing with the primers ctagtatctacgacacac and cgatttttgtgatgctcgtc was used to position inserts on chromosome and hence construct a contig . the _PROTEIN_ mutant was transformed with selected cosmid clones to find clones that suppressed radial swelling and promoted root elongation when plants were exposed to for days conditions that inhibited elongation and promoted radial swelling in the mutant . before transfer to the position of the root tip was marked with a scratch on the petri dish so that at the end of the experiment the extension growth at was readily apparent . the complementing clones located the mutation to one of four genes that were all sequenced . to confirm complementation was due to _GENE_ a coding sequence fragment was pcr amplified from columbia dna _PROTEIN_ digested with saci and cloned into the binary vector . wild type columbia _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ seeds were germinated on vertical plates containing agar with hoagland 's medium . after days at representatives of each genotype were transferred to fresh plates containing hoagland 's medium with either mm uridine mm inosine or mm udp _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or no addition and the position of the root tip was marked on the base of the plate . the chemical additions were filter sterilized added after autoclaving of the _PROTEIN_ medium and did not change the ph . plates were incubated at for a further days and values for the increase in root length after transfer were averaged for plants . to compare _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ seedlings grown as above were transferred to plates containing either mm uridine or mmd galactose . root elongation was measured after a further days at _PROTEIN_ or at _PROTEIN_ . analysis of cell wall composition was as described by citation . vectors for the constitutive _PROTEIN_ of the _GENE_ and _GENE_ genes were constructed by pcr amplification of the coding sequences from columbia dna digestion with appropriate restriction enzymes and cloning into the vector and thence into . primers used were aaaggtaccgtcaaatacgaatacgattc and tacggatccagagagaatccatcgaaaatc to make _GENE_ and tttggtacctgtcgggatttcgaatgg and tcatctagaagaggtgtggtgtgtgtt to make _GENE_ . seedlings were assessed for complementation as described under map based cloning of the _PROTEIN_ mutation . fusion of the promoter of the rpi gene _GENE_ with the bacterial uid _PROTEIN_ gene was accomplished by ligation of a pcr product from arabidopsis ecotype columbia into the gus binary vector pcambia . the primer pair ttcgagctcaccgttgagactactg aacccatggtacgcgacttgc was used to amplify bp upstream from the start codon of _GENE_ . the pcr product was cleaved with ncoi/saci and ligated into the vector pcambia . the resulting plasmid _GENE_ gus was introduced into arabidopsis ecotype columbia via agrobacterium mediated transformation . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was examined on homozygous plants by first immersing the tissue briefly in v/v acetone transferring to an infiltration medium _PROTEIN_ repeatedly applying and releasing a vacuum for h and then incubating overnight at . chlorophyll was removed by washing with increasing concentrations of ethanol and tissue was visualized and photographed by light microscopy . for examination of the intracellular location of the rpi proteins produced by _GENE_ and _GENE_ the respective proteins were fused to the n terminus of the _METHOD_ from aequoria victoria . the primer pairs _PROTEIN_ actccatggcaaacctatccttgacggtaa and tccccatggcgcttgcgtatgatcctc tgtccatgggtttgttcttgatcttaac were used to pcr amplify the coding sequences of the genes _GENE_ and _GENE_ respectively from arabidopsis ecotype columbia . products were cleaved with ncoi and ligated individually into the ncoi site of the vector pcambia thus fusing each sequence in frame with the _METHOD_ sequence and allowing camv driven _PROTEIN_ of the respective fusion proteins _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . the constructs and as a negative control the empty vector were transformed into wild type columbia and the roots of plants examined by confocal microscopy . as positive control for a _LOCATION_ location seedlings _PROTEIN_ a _METHOD_ construct without organelle targeting sequences were viewed under similar conditions . _GENE_ _METHOD_ was also transformed into _PROTEIN_ to confirm its ability to complement the mutant phenotype . the rpi gene _PROTEIN_ established by _PROTEIN_ was obtained from the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ database . _PROTEIN_ of _GENE_ and _GENE_ was similar in both classic and signature libraries whereas _GENE_ was virtually undetectable in all classic libraries probably reflecting some intrinsic feature of this transcript . for consistency therefore only data derived from the signature method are presented for all three genes . the sequences of the three arabidopsis rpi genes were analysed for their evolutionary origin by examination of the duplicated blocks found by the arabidopsis genome initiative and the blocks found by citation . the rpi enzyme activity was measured in extracts from root tissue of wild type and _PROTEIN_ plants grown on agar for days at followed by days at . the assay involved coupling the activity of rpi to phospho ribulose kinase pyruvate kinase and lactate dehydrogenase and spectrophotometrically measuring the oxidation of nadh at nm . root tissue was extracted in ml of ice cold extraction buffer . a aliquot was added to of assay buffer containing mm nadh mm _PROTEIN_ mm dtt mm phosphoenolpyruvate mg pyruvate kinase/lactate dehydrogenase and phosphoribulokinase . reaction mixtures were incubated for min prior to initiating the assay of enzyme activity by adding of mm ribose phosphate . the rate of nadh oxidation was monitored for min using a hewlett packard diode array spectrophotometer . differences were assessed for significance at the level using the student 's t test .
