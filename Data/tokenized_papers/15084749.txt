bioluminescence resonance energy transfer between renilla luciferase and yellow _METHOD_ protein has been _PROTEIN_ to serve as a real time reporter on protein protein interactions in live plant cells by using the arabidopsis constitutive photomorphogenesis _PROTEIN_ protein as a model system . _PROTEIN_ is a repressor of light signal transduction that functions as part of a _LOCATION_ ubiquitin ligase . _PROTEIN_ possesses a leucine rich _LOCATION_ exclusion signal that resides in a domain implicated in _PROTEIN_ dimerization . bret was applied in conjunction with site directed mutagenesis to explore the respective contributions of the _LOCATION_ exclusion and dimerization motifs to the regulation of _PROTEIN_ activity in vivo . one specific mutant protein _PROTEIN_ showed increased _LOCATION_ accumulation but retained the ability to dimerize as monitored by bret whereas other mutations inhibited both _LOCATION_ exclusion and _PROTEIN_ dimerization . mutant rescue and overexpression experiments indicated that _LOCATION_ exclusion of _PROTEIN_ protein is a rate limiting step in light signal transduction .
sequence motifs for _LOCATION_ exclusion of _PROTEIN_ . to address the hypothesis that _PROTEIN_ activity is limited by _LOCATION_ exclusion site directed mutations were introduced into each of three clusters of leucine residues that are found throughout the residue _PROTEIN_ domain of _PROTEIN_ . when _PROTEIN_ as _METHOD_ fusion proteins in transiently transformed onion epidermal cells all three single mutants as well as double and triple mutants displayed increased _LOCATION_ localization . the _PROTEIN_ mutant protein was moderately but significantly more _LOCATION_ than wt whereas most other single double and triple mutants were predominantly _LOCATION_ . these data indicate that _LOCATION_ exclusion of _PROTEIN_ is governed by a multipartite or extended domain . notably although the _PROTEIN_ fragment encompassing residues can target a heterologous _LOCATION_ protein to _LOCATION_ speckles none of the mutants tested were disrupted in this respect but rather continued to form _LOCATION_ speckles similar to wt _PROTEIN_ . next two representative _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ mutants _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were _PROTEIN_ from stable transgenes in arabidopsis . at similar overall _PROTEIN_ levels the _PROTEIN_ mutant formed smaller cytoplasmic inclusion bodies than wt _PROTEIN_ and accumulated in the _LOCATION_ to higher levels than wt _PROTEIN_ . similar results were obtained for _PROTEIN_ . therefore both the leu and leu motifs are important for _LOCATION_ exclusion in arabidopsis . bret assay and _PROTEIN_ dimerization . to test which mutations of leucine rich motifs might compromise _PROTEIN_ dimerization in vivo we adopted the bret assay . first transgenic arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ an rluc _METHOD_ fusion protein displayed a bimodal luminescence spectrum whereas rluc alone gave a single peak near nm as expected . these data demonstrate unambiguously that rluc and _METHOD_ are compatible partners for bret in plant cells . coexpression of and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in onion epidermal cells yielded an elevated yellow to blue ratio compared with rluc _PROTEIN_ alone indicating bret between rluc _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and thus interaction between wt _PROTEIN_ proteins . when rluc tagged _PROTEIN_ mutants were tested for heterodimerization with wt _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ mutant significantly retained full interaction whereas all other mutants tested interacted less well or not at all . consistent results were obtained when the rluc and _METHOD_ tags were swapped between the _PROTEIN_ partners or when testing for homodimerization of _PROTEIN_ mutants . all bret signals depended on the presence of a _METHOD_ partner protein . no bret was observed with rluc _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ alone . the reduction of the bret signal seen with specific _PROTEIN_ alleles such as _PROTEIN_ and the triple mutant was not simply caused by an inadvertent drop in _PROTEIN_ of the _METHOD_ partner because no significant increase of the bret signal was detected when the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plasmid ratio was increased by a _PROTEIN_ of . together these results indicate that the leu ala mutation partially inhibits _LOCATION_ exclusion but not _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ interaction . complementation test and gain of function assay . the dimerizing _PROTEIN_ allele and the _PROTEIN_ allele as a representative allele with poor dimerization were tested for functionality by transgenic rescue of the null allele _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ allele was able to rescue the _PROTEIN_ mutant . the _PROTEIN_ mutants carrying the _PROTEIN_ transgene were etiolated fully in darkness i.e. rescue was complete . in contrast no rescue was observed with the _PROTEIN_ allele among families tested . these results may suggest that the ability of _PROTEIN_ to dimerize is important for _PROTEIN_ function . hypocotyl length has served previously as an indicator of _PROTEIN_ activity in a gain of function assay . the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ transgene caused an elongated hypocotyl under constant far red light but not in darkness compared with a similar level of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ suggesting that the increased _LOCATION_ accumulation of this mutant is functionally significant . likewise the _PROTEIN_ mutant also caused increased hypocotyl elongation although it did not complement _PROTEIN_ . clearly hypocotyl elongation correlated with increased _LOCATION_ localization . the hypocotyl elongation phenotype of _PROTEIN_ may arise because this mutant continues to accumulate in _LOCATION_ speckles and still may be able to interact with _LOCATION_ targets that are effectors of _PROTEIN_ activity despite its reduced tendency to dimerize . the _METHOD_ tagged wt and mutant _PROTEIN_ proteins accumulated to similar levels in the specific lines compared in this experiment as judged by _METHOD_ microscopy and immunoblotting . in summary these data suggest that increased _LOCATION_ targeting of _PROTEIN_ promotes etiolation and that _LOCATION_ exclusion of _PROTEIN_ protein is a rate limiting step in light signal transduction .
general procedures . conditions for plant growth far red light treatments agrobacterium mediated transformation quantitative _METHOD_ microscopy and immunoblotting were as described . site directed mutagenesis was carried out on a wild type _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plasmid driven by the cauliflower mosaic virus promoter by using overlap extension pcr . for the _PROTEIN_ mutation a fragment upstream and including the leu ala mutation was amplified by using the oligonucleotides aag aat gga atc aaa gtt aac ttc and tgc tgc ctt atc tgc agc gaa att agg gta aag ctg att att g . a separate fragment including the leu ala mutation and downstream sequences was amplified with the overlapping oligonucleotide tcg ctg cag ata agg cag caa aga aaa ctt cag ctc ggc atg tg and tct cat gtg gcc atg cat ttc . the two pcr products were mixed and merged by reamplification using the peripheral two primers and the resulting product was subcloned . the mutated segment was reexcised with hpai and nsii and used to replace the corresponding _PROTEIN_ segment in the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plasmid . other site directed mutations were generated in a likewise fashion and confirmed by dna sequencing . t dnas harboring _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion transgenes were introduced first into arabidopsis heterozygous for the _PROTEIN_ t dna insertion allele . transgenic progeny were examined for functional complementation of the _PROTEIN_ allele and for the effect of the transgene on hypocotyl elongation in a wt _PROTEIN_ background . see determination of _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ levels in transiently transformed onion epidermal cells which is published as supporting information on the pnas web site . this determination was done by quantifying pixel intensity after correcting for background _METHOD_ levels . bret assays . luminescence spectra were obtained from to day old light grown seedlings in the presence of coelenterazine in a fluorolog spectrofluorimeter with blocked excitation path and with the slit width set at nm . a vector containing promoter and terminator signals suitable for transiently _PROTEIN_ rluc fusion proteins was created by amplifying the rluc cdna from prl null . a _METHOD_ tagging vector _METHOD_ was constructed similarly by using enhanced _METHOD_ cdna _PROTEIN_ . rluc and a rluc _METHOD_ fusion were introduced into transgenic arabidopsis . _PROTEIN_ cdnas were inserted into the bglii site of the bret vectors to generate n terminally tagged _PROTEIN_ fusions . for bret assays ng of each _PROTEIN_ plasmid were coated onto tungsten particles and introduced into onion epidermal cells by using the _PROTEIN_ he particle gun . after overnight incubation in darkness and the addition of coelenterazine substrate in water yellow to blue luminescence ratios were collected on a td tube luminometer equipped with the dual color accessory . typically four pairs of sec readings were taken through blue and yellow filters . readings were averaged and background was subtracted by using a reading from untransformed tissue . unless otherwise indicated data presented are from at least three independent transformations .
