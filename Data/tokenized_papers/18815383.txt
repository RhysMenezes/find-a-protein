nudix hydrolases act to hydrolyze ribonucleoside and deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates nucleotide sugars coenzymes or dinucleoside polyphosphates . arabidopsis contains genes encoding nudix hydrolase homologues _PROTEIN_ with a predicted distribution in the _LOCATION_ mitochondria and chloroplasts . previously _LOCATION_ nudix hydrolases _PROTEIN_ were characterized . here we conducted a characterization of organelle type atnudx proteins _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ showed pyrophosphohydrolase activity toward both adp ribose and adp _PROTEIN_ although its km value was approximately fold lower for adp ribose than for adp _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ hydrolyzed not only reduced coenzyme a but also a wide range of its derivatives . _PROTEIN_ showed pyrophosphohydrolase activity toward both nadh and nadph . _PROTEIN_ had flavin adenine dinucleotide pyrophosphohydrolase activity . both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ hydrolyzed diadenosine polyphosphates . a confocal microscopic analysis using a green _METHOD_ protein fusion protein showed that _PROTEIN_ is distributed in mitochondria and _PROTEIN_ and are distributed in chloroplasts . these atnudx mrnas were detected ubiquitously in various arabidopsis tissues . the t dna insertion mutants of _PROTEIN_ and did not exhibit any phenotypical differences under normal growth conditions . these results suggest that nudix hydrolases in arabidopsis control a variety of metabolites and are pertinent to a wide range of physiological processes .
predictions of the existence of transit peptide and cleavage sites in the deduced amino acid sequences of all organelle type atnudxs were made with the targetp prediction program . consequently it was predicted that _PROTEIN_ to are localized in mitochondria and _PROTEIN_ to and are localized in chloroplasts . similar results were obtained by an analysis using the psort prediction program _METHOD_ . among the predicted organelle type atnudxs mitochondrial _PROTEIN_ and chloroplastic _PROTEIN_ contained the conserved motif lltxr _METHOD_ which is found upstream of the nudix motif to hydrolyze coa like _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ human _PROTEIN_ mouse _PROTEIN_ yeast and c. elegans . the deduced amino acid sequence corresponding to the mature _PROTEIN_ shared high homology with that of _PROTEIN_ . the sequence of chloroplastic _PROTEIN_ retained the _METHOD_ motif with nadh pyrophosphohydrolases such as human _PROTEIN_ e. coli _PROTEIN_ and yeast _PROTEIN_ proteins . the sequences corresponding to the mature chloroplastic _PROTEIN_ showed homology with that of _PROTEIN_ . both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ shared high similarity to a nudix hydrolase that acts on asymmetric diadenosine tetraphosphates from lupinus angustifolius . the deduced amino acid sequences of other predicted organelle type atnudxs showed no significant homology to any conserved motifs except the nudix motif in nudix hydrolases from various _METHOD_ . a nudix hydrolase e. coli mutt has oxidized nucleotide pyrophosphohydrolase activity hydrolyzing all canonical nucleoside triphosphates but with a preference for oxo _PROTEIN_ the oxidized form of the free guanine nucleotide by attacking ros . these oxidized guanine nucleoside triphosphates would cause both replicational and transcriptional _LOCATION_ since they pair with adenine and cytosine with almost the same efficiency . therefore e. coli mutt functions in the prevention of mutagenic consequences . recently we demonstrated that one of the _LOCATION_ atnudxs _PROTEIN_ acts on the hydrolysis of oxo _PROTEIN_ and plays an important role in protection against oxidative dna and rna damage in plant cells . first to identify an oxo _PROTEIN_ pyrophosphohydrolase in the predicted organelle type atnudxs we examined the effect of the _PROTEIN_ of these atnudxs on the rate of spontaneous mutation toward rifampicin resistance in the e. coli strain which was devoid of its own oxo _PROTEIN_ pyrophosphohydrolase activity . as shown in supplemental table the mutation frequency of cells carrying the cdnas for each mature atnudx protein in the absence of the predicted transit peptide cloned into the _PROTEIN_ vector was almost the same as that of the cells transfected with an empty . these results suggest that none of the mitochondrial and chloroplastic atnudxs contains the mutt type oxo _PROTEIN_ pyrophosphohydrolase activity although it is possible that these atnudxs would be inactive following _PROTEIN_ in e. coli . to characterize the recombinant _METHOD_ of predicted organelle type atnudxs each recombinant form of the mature atnudx proteins in the absence of predicted mitochondrial or chloroplastic transit peptide at the n terminus was produced using e. coli strain plyss cells and purified from the extract using a hitrap chelating column . the hydrolytic activities of these enzymes for various types of nucleoside diphosphate derivatives were measured in the presence of mm by hplc . among the mitochondrial atnudxs _PROTEIN_ hydrolyzed adp rib and adp glc . a reaction product amp was detected in the reaction mixture by hplc analysis indicating that adp rib and adp glc are hydrolyzed by the enzyme to amp and rib p and to amp and glc p respectively . the km value for adp rib of _PROTEIN_ was approximately fold lower than that for adp glc . on the other hand the vmax value for adp glc was approximately fold higher than that for adp rib . mitochondrial _PROTEIN_ hydrolyzed coa similar to _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ as reported previously . a reaction product adp was detected indicating that coas are hydrolyzed by the enzyme to adp and phosphopantetheine . the enzyme showed high affinity for coa compared with the other coa pyrophosphohydrolases such as yeast mouse _PROTEIN_ and c. elegans . no activity toward any other substrate tested here was detected in mitochondrial _PROTEIN_ and . substrate specificity of the predicted organelle type atnudxs the activities of the recombinant atnudx proteins were measured at with mm in the absence or presence of mm dtt as described in materials and methods. all values for specific activity are in . data in parentheses are values in the presence of mm dtt . data are means of three independent determinations sd . n.d. not detected . comparison of kinetic parameters of adp sugar and fad pyrophosphohydrolases in arabidopsis e. coli human m. jannaschii synechococcus p. thiaminolyticus and bacteriophage the standard assay was used with concentrations of to for adp rib adp glu and fad at with mm as described in materials and methods. data are means of three independent determinations sd . not determined . comparison of kinetic parameters of coa pyrophosphohydrolases in arabidopsis c. elegans mouse and yeast the standard assay was used with concentrations of to for coa at with mm as described in materials and methods. data are means of three independent determinations sd . not determined . among chloroplastic atnudxs _PROTEIN_ showed nadh and nadph pyrophosphohydrolase activities . a reaction product amp or adp was detected by hplc analysis indicating that nadh and nadph are hydrolyzed to reduced nicotinamide mononucleotide and amp and to nmnh and adp respectively . the km value for nadh of the enzyme was higher than that of other nadh pyrophosphohydrolases such as _LOCATION_ atnudxs yeast _PROTEIN_ and human _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ showed high affinity for nadph compared with that for nadh . _PROTEIN_ had pyrophosphohydrolase activity toward both fad and adp rib . reaction product fmn and/or amp were detected . the km value for fad was markedly lower than that of paenibacillus thiaminolyticus yzgd and bacteriophage . on the other hand the enzyme showed low affinity for adp rib . _PROTEIN_ hydrolyzed and . and diadenosine triphosphates were hydrolyzed to _PROTEIN_ and amp and to _PROTEIN_ and adp respectively . although the enzyme also hydrolyzed oxo _PROTEIN_ and deoxynucleoside triphosphates these activities were much lower than those toward and . in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ could not complement the mutator phenotype of the e. coli strain indicating that the enzyme is not associated with the sanitization of nucleotide pools in vivo . _PROTEIN_ hydrolyzed only to _PROTEIN_ and adp . _PROTEIN_ showed no activity toward coa or any other substrates although it had the conserved motif for coa pyrophosphohydrolase . _PROTEIN_ and also had no activity toward any other substrate tested here . comparison of kinetic parameters of nad h pyrophosphohydrolases in arabidopsis yeast and human the standard assay was used with concentrations of to nad h at with mm as described in materials and methods. data are means of three independent determinations sd . comparison of kinetic parameters of apna pyrophosphohydrolases in arabidopsis l. angustifolius and t. thermophilus the standard assay was used with concentrations of to apna at with mm as described in materials and methods. data are means of three independent determinations sd . not determined . recently olejnik et al . reported that _PROTEIN_ had activities specific for long chain apna under reducing conditions treated with mm dithiothreitol suggesting that treatment with the reducing agent was required for the detection of the hydrolytic activity of nudix hydrolases . therefore we assayed the hydrolytic activities in the reaction medium containing the reducing agent mm dtt as shown in the parentheses in table i. _PROTEIN_ hydrolyzed only under the reducing conditions . in addition the activities of _PROTEIN_ and toward apna in the presence of mm dtt were increased compared with those in the absence of the agent . on the other hand the coa pyrophosphohydrolase activity of _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ to . no activity was detected in _PROTEIN_ and toward any substrates tested under the reducing conditions . previously we demonstrated that no activity toward any substrates tested was detected in the _LOCATION_ and proteins . so we assayed the hydrolytic activities of these enzymes under the reducing conditions treated with mm dtt but we could not detect the enzyme activities toward any substrates . these findings suggest that treatment with dtt is essential for the apna pyrophosphohydrolases such as _PROTEIN_ and . coa pyrophosphohydrolases such as s. cerevisiae mouse _PROTEIN_ and c. elegans were active toward various coa derivatives . therefore we examined the substrate specificity for various coa derivatives of atnudxs with coa pyrophosphohydrolase activity . mitochondrial _PROTEIN_ was highly active toward oxidized coa the same as yeast while _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ hydrolyzed malonyl coa . interestingly both enzymes showed high levels of activity toward medium and long chain fatty acyl coa including hexanoyl coa lauroyl coa myristoyl coa and palmitoyl coa . substrate specificity of coa pyrophosphohydrolases activity with coa and coa derivatives was measured at with mm as described in materials and methods. results are _PROTEIN_ as percentage of the degradation rate obtained with coa . n.d. not detected . not determined . as the nudix hydrolases require various divalent cations for their activities we analyzed the effect of several divalent cations on the activities of mitochondrial and chloroplastic atnudxs . was most effective for the _PROTEIN_ activity toward adp rib . the activity in the presence of mm was approximately of that in the presence of . the activities of _PROTEIN_ and in the presence of mm were and respectively of those in the presence of mm . was the most effective divalent ion for _PROTEIN_ activity toward fad . the presence of mm resulted in of the activity compared with that with mm . however and concentrations of mm are approximately fold higher than typical levels in growing cells . the activities of _PROTEIN_ and in the presence of or were not detected . therefore in most cases is likely to be physically the most relevant divalent cation for all organelle type atnudxs in vivo . the activities of _PROTEIN_ and toward any substrates were not observed even under the presence of several divalent cations . next we confirmed the subcellular distributions of predicted mitochondrial _PROTEIN_ and chloroplastic _PROTEIN_ atnudxs having hydrolysis activities in vitro in plant cells using their _METHOD_ fusion proteins . the full length atnudx cdnas including the transit peptides were fused in frame with _METHOD_ at the c terminus and then transformed into tobacco by cells or arabidopsis cultured cells . the _METHOD_ of the _METHOD_ fusion proteins in the transgenic cells was monitored using confocal microscopy . as shown in figure the _METHOD_ of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein was colocalized with mitochondria stained by mitotraker orange in the tobacco by cells . on the other hand the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was not detected in mitochondria but was colocalized with chlorophyll _METHOD_ in the arabidopsis cells although it was predicted to be distributed in mitochondria based on its deduced amino acid sequence . the _METHOD_ of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein was detected in both chloroplasts and _LOCATION_ but it was _PROTEIN_ distributed in the chloroplasts . the _METHOD_ of _PROTEIN_ or _METHOD_ fusion protein was colocalized with chlorophyll _METHOD_ . semiquantitative reverse transcription pcr was performed to determine the tissue specific _PROTEIN_ of predicted organelle type atnudx mrnas . as shown in figure almost all of the atnudx mrnas were _PROTEIN_ ubiquitously in the rosette leaves _METHOD_ cauline leaves inflorescences and roots . on the other hand the level of _PROTEIN_ mrna was lowest in the rosette leaves and highest in the inflorescence among the various tissues . the _PROTEIN_ mrna was _PROTEIN_ specifically in the rosette and cauline leaves . the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ mrna was observed in the inflorescences and rosette and cauline leaves . these results suggest that the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ and mrnas is regulated in a tissue specific manner although their substrate specificities remain unclear . similar _PROTEIN_ patterns of the organelle type atnudxs in the tissues are observed in the genevestigator arabidopsis microarray database . according to the detailed information about tissue specific _PROTEIN_ of the organelle type atnudxs from the database it is notable that _PROTEIN_ and are highly _PROTEIN_ in pollen and/or stamen suggesting an involvement of the proteins in the male reproductive organs . to assess the physiological relevance of the individual organelle type atnudxs we studied effects of the disruption of organelle type atnudxs on the growth and morphology of arabidopsis mutants . t dna insertion arabidopsis mutants of _PROTEIN_ and have been registered in the signal project . a complete loss of mrna _PROTEIN_ caused by homozygous t dna insertion into the respective atnudxs except for _PROTEIN_ and in each mutant was verified by semiquantitative rt pcr analysis . in both t dna mutants of _PROTEIN_ the t dna insertion locating in the fourth intron resulted in significant suppression of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ indicating an inhibition of pre mrna splicing by the insertion . no t dna insertion was detected in the genome of the t dna mutant of _PROTEIN_ therefore the level of _PROTEIN_ mrna was not altered in the mutant . under long day conditions no difference between the wild type plants and the t dna mutants _PROTEIN_ was observed in growth and morphology throughout the cultivation period .

using a hitrap chelating hp column according to the manufacturer 's instructions . protein content was determined following the method of citation . almost all of the recombinant _METHOD_ of predicted organelle type atnudxs were produced in e. coli with high efficiency in the soluble fraction . however the recombinant _PROTEIN_ and proteins were detected only in the insoluble fraction because of the formation of inclusion bodies . therefore we recloned these cdnas into the vector pcold tf which _PROTEIN_ trigger _PROTEIN_ chaperone as a soluble tag . as a result these recombinant proteins were observed in the soluble fraction . all of the recombinant proteins were purified to homogeneity using a hitrap chelating hp column as judged with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . the molecular _METHOD_ of each recombinant atnudx protein agreed with the predicted value which was calculated from the amino acid sequence of the mature protein plus the hexahistidine tag . hydrolytic activities of the recombinant _METHOD_ of mitochondrial or chloroplastic atnudxs toward various types of nucleoside diphosphate derivatives were assayed according to a method described previously . sixty microliters of
