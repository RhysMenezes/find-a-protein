in order to identify ehs involved in cutin biosynthesis we mined publicly available transcriptome data to identify putative eh genes with genes using the cypedia platform . through this approach we found the a. thaliana gene _GENE_ which was coexpressed in the organ and tissue data set with _PROTEIN_ a known fa epoxygenase and _PROTEIN_ which is involved in cutin synthesis . the catalytic amino acids identified in various characterized ehs are conserved in in particular asp and his which correspond to asp and his from mouse eh that are implicated in hydrolysis of the epoxide during catalysis . thus protein sequence analysis supported the hypothesis that is an eh . it is noteworthy that is missing the domain of mammalian enzymes resulting in a fairly small protein with a calculated _METHOD_ of kda and a pi of . as already mentioned mammalian ehs are both _LOCATION_ and microsomal _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . much less information is available concerning plant ehs but both localizations have been reported based on enzymatic activity . to determine if was _LOCATION_ or _LOCATION_ subcellular localization of the protein was explored via transient _PROTEIN_ of or _METHOD_ proteins in n. benthamiana leaves . as presented in fig . confocal observations showed that behaved as a typical _LOCATION_ protein when compared with control soluble _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ and behaved differently from the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ anchor . this result was consistent _PROTEIN_ of the position of the _METHOD_ tag . this finding was confirmed by subcellular fractionation and western blot analysis showing that occurrence is restricted to the _LOCATION_ fraction . to assess the eh capabilities of we first incubated radiolabeled acid with _LOCATION_ of yeast _PROTEIN_ and the reaction products were resolved by radiochromatography . incubation was performed with the _LOCATION_ fraction of yeast _PROTEIN_ or with the _LOCATION_ fraction of yeast transformed with an empty vector . after min a single major metabolite was formed . it was not formed in an incubation with _LOCATION_ from yeast transformed with a void plasmid . taken together these results suggest that formation of the metabolite from peak is attributable to the catalytic activity of . metabolite from this peak was purified derivatized and subjected to _METHOD_ analysis . the _METHOD_ spectrum of the derivatized metabolite showed an ion at m/z values of o and resulting from cleavage between two hydroxyls carrying the trimethylsilyl group generated after hydrolysis by the enzyme . this fragmentation pattern is characteristic of the derivative of acid . when the _PROTEIN_ function of acid was blocked by a methyl was unable to catalyze the transformation of the epoxide to the corresponding diol . as shown in fig . a major _PROTEIN_ metabolite was produced after incubation of acid which is a product of a reaction catalyzed by _PROTEIN_ . this major _PROTEIN_ metabolite was not produced with the _LOCATION_ fraction of yeast transformed with an empty vector . the _METHOD_ spectrum of this derivatized metabolite showed ions at m/z values of and o . the _METHOD_ spectrum also showed ions at and resulting from cleavage between two hydroxyls carrying the trimethylsilyl . this fragmentation pattern is characteristic of the derivative of acid . these data thus demonstrate that is an eh acting on acid and on acid . no enzymatic activity was detected when incubations were performed with microsomes from transformed yeast confirming the _LOCATION_ localization of determined by confocal microscopy . viability of microsomes was checked by measuring palmitic acid metabolism in microsomes of yeast transformed in parallel with a construct coding for _PROTEIN_ . in order to investigate the involvement of in cutin synthesis we isolated mutant lines homozygous for an insertion in . in the insertional mutant lines and transcripts were not detected when analyzed by which confirmed that they were ko lines . the spatiotemporal pattern of _PROTEIN_ investigated by revealed very low _PROTEIN_ in all the organs tested . publicly available a. thaliana transcriptome data sets showed higher _PROTEIN_ of in seeds and to a lesser extent in some parts of flowers which was corroborated by data from genevestigator . we therefore first analyzed the composition and content of polyesters in whole mature seeds of these ko lines by _METHOD_ . the only significant difference between ko and wt lines in the seed fa cutin monomers was a reduction in acid in ko . because small amounts of a putative epoxy fa could be detected on the gc chromatogram of ko we decided to set up a more sensitive method based on _METHOD_ to analyze the monomer extracts . analysis by this method revealed in ko a striking increase in the expected derivative for a fa . in order to obtain information on the position of the epoxy group in this monomer free fatty monomers with unopened epoxy _PROTEIN_ were prepared from cell walls of wt and ko seeds digested with cutinase from f. solani and were analyzed by _METHOD_ . based on exact _METHOD_ one free fa monomer abundant in ko could be detected . its fragmentation pattern was consistent with an acid the expected precursor for a acid . analysis of leaf cutin monomers by _METHOD_ allowed us to show that disruption of the gene coding for led to an almost complete disappearance of acid and to a concomitant strong accumulation of the peak identified in seeds as acid . a _PROTEIN_ in the other minor leaf monomer acid with an accumulation of the corresponding acid was also noted . to investigate the function of in seed physiology we analyzed seed germination rates under standard and hyperosmotic conditions . seeds of were sown on _METHOD_ medium in the absence or presence of mannitol . on standard _METHOD_ medium seeds of and wt lines both germinated at the same rate . under stress conditions germination of seeds was delayed compared with wt seeds after d on _METHOD_ only of seeds had germinated when practically all wt seeds had germinated . this delay was not more visible after d . to investigate the impact of gene disruption on seed coat properties the permeability of the seed coat of the mutants was studied using tetrazolium salt . as shown in fig . after staining for h and seed coats were significantly more permeable to dye than were wt seed coats . ehs are widely distributed proteins found in all _METHOD_ . we endeavored to reconstruct their evolutionary history in embryophytes to determine whether family diversification occurred in the course of land colonization . a set of sequences derived from land plant species from bryophytes to _METHOD_ were retrieved from genome and transcriptome databases based on their homology to the protein . already characterized eh sequences from mouse human and rat were used as an outgroup to _PROTEIN_ the evolutionary scenario . the eh phylogeny overall matched systematics but also uncovered family diversification in recent phylogenetic groups . seven genes potentially encoding ehs are for instance present in a. thaliana _METHOD_ while only a single gene was found in the fully sequenced picea abies genome _METHOD_ . tree structure however suggests that an early duplication arose in the ancestor of seed plants but one duplicate was lost in _METHOD_ while being retained in _METHOD_ . in the land plants bryophytes and lycophytes eh was typically present as a gene as observed in the physcomitrella patens marchantia polymorpha and selaginella moellendorffii genomes . taken together these observations indicate that eh proteins were conserved across land plant evolution and diversified in _METHOD_ probably in support of the increased complexity of reproductive tissues .
