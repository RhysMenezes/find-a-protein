plants have evolved a variety of _METHOD_ to _PROTEIN_ to n starvation . nitrate _PROTEIN_ is one of seven _PROTEIN_ family genes in arabidopsis thaliana and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is induced under n starvation . green _METHOD_ protein and _PROTEIN_ reporter analyses revealed that _PROTEIN_ is a _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ transporter _PROTEIN_ in the epidermis of _PROTEIN_ roots and in or close to the shoot phloem . the spatiotemporal _PROTEIN_ pattern of _PROTEIN_ in roots is complementary with that of the major high affinity nitrate transporter _PROTEIN_ . functional analysis in xenopus laevis oocytes and in planta showed that _PROTEIN_ is a nitrate transporter functioning in the high affinity range . in n starved _PROTEIN_ mutants nitrate uptake under low external supply and nitrate content in shoot phloem exudates was _PROTEIN_ . in the absence of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ loss of function of _PROTEIN_ has an impact on _METHOD_ production under low nitrate supply . together our results demonstrate that _PROTEIN_ is a nitrate transporter that has a role in both roots and shoots under n starvation .
the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ genes in arabidopsis is regulated by n availability . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ patterns are different with the _PROTEIN_ transcript level being highest under severe n starvation and repressed by resupply with a n source . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ increases only transiently after the onset of n starvation and a resupply of induces _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . we analyzed the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in comparison to _PROTEIN_ in response to n supply in our experimental system using young seedlings grown in mm for d and then transferred to different n sources or to medium without n for d. compared with the replete control where _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ at low levels only in roots _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in roots increased fold under n starvation and became detectable in shoots . no induction of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was observed under phosphate or sulfate starved conditions indicating that the _PROTEIN_ is not responding to general nutrient deficiency stress . after transfer to ammonium _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ . this _PROTEIN_ profile was different from that of _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ was also _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in roots but _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was high on lower on and not significantly changed under starvation conditions compared with . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ steadily with increased concentration in the medium _PROTEIN_ whereas _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ only between and mm was unchanged between and mm supplies . however repression of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ occurred at a similar concentration for both genes . given the increased _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in n depleted roots we followed the time course patterns of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ during n starvation . seven day old seedlings were transferred from full n medium to either n free or full n medium and samples were taken after and d of transfer for gene _PROTEIN_ studies and measurements . content _PROTEIN_ rapidly after transfer to n free medium attaining and in roots and shoots respectively after h and then dropped to barely detectable levels at and d respectively . after transfer to n free medium _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ increased until day and stayed high afterwards . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ increased at day but _PROTEIN_ again and stayed at a slightly higher level than at day . the latter might be due to a general slight increase in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ with developmental age as a similar time dependent pattern was observed for _PROTEIN_ of the same gene on full n medium . we also confirmed the induction of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ by n starvation on older plants grown in hydroponic culture . similar to the _PROTEIN_ pattern in seedlings the transfer of d old plants grown on mm solution to a solution without n rapidly induced _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ reaching a plateau after d of starvation . in these hydroponically grown plants we confirmed earlier data showing that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ when n was resupplied to n starved plants which was opposite to the _PROTEIN_ response of _PROTEIN_ whose _PROTEIN_ was induced specifically by after starvation . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was lower than that for _PROTEIN_ in all the tested conditions . this very specific _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ profile might be an indication of a distinct but complementary function for _PROTEIN_ in comparison to _PROTEIN_ . we further characterized the localization of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in comparison to _PROTEIN_ using fusions between either the _PROTEIN_ or the _PROTEIN_ promoter and the green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ reporter gene . these constructs were stably introduced into the arabidopsis columbia accession and two individual transgenic lines were each studied . figure shows typical results of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ of one of these transformants growing either under n starvation or with full n supply . _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was observed only under n starvation in _PROTEIN_ and in the younger parts of the primary root but not in the older parts of the _PROTEIN_ root . under the same conditions _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was observed in the older part of the _PROTEIN_ root of plants grown in full n and in the _PROTEIN_ root and at lower level in the _PROTEIN_ of n starved plants . the preferential _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in older parts of the _PROTEIN_ root _METHOD_ previously reported results . we also confirmed the above described dose dependent _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ using the _METHOD_ construct . _PROTEIN_ studies using quantitative rt pcr showed very low _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in shoots but no _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was observed in shoots . therefore we further characterized the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ using a fusion between the _PROTEIN_ promoter and the _PROTEIN_ reporter gene which is more sensitive than _METHOD_ . this construct was again stably introduced into the arabidopsis col plants and two individual transgenic lines were studied . figure shows typical results from gus staining of one of these transformants grown under n starvation . confirming _METHOD_ results gus staining was observed chiefly in _PROTEIN_ roots . in cross sections near the division zone and in longitudinal sections _PROTEIN_ promoter activity was observed _PROTEIN_ in the epidermis of _PROTEIN_ roots . in shoots gus staining was restricted to the vascular tissue . _PROTEIN_ promoter activity was observed _PROTEIN_ in the primary vein and sometimes in secondary veins . the same localization was observed in flower stalks . staining cell walls with propidium iodide allowed the localization of gus _PROTEIN_ to or close to the phloem probably to the phloem parenchyma . this _PROTEIN_ pattern was confirmed by quantitative rt pcr on rna isolated from veins and leaf blades of adult plants grown either under full n or in n starvation . despite very low _PROTEIN_ levels a significant increase of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was observed in veins of n starved plants compared with plants grown on full n . the biological function of transporters depends highly on their subcellular localization . therefore a c terminal translational fusion of _METHOD_ to _PROTEIN_ under the control of the _PROTEIN_ promoter _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was introduced into arabidopsis col plants and confocal microscopy analyses were performed on homozygous lines . in the root epidermal cells under n deprivation green _METHOD_ was detected in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . this localization was confirmed by staining lipid _LOCATION_ using the red _METHOD_ probe and by merging the two pictures indicating that _PROTEIN_ was located at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein was predominantly found in the external _LOCATION_ of the epidermal cells facing the nutrient solution . this _PROTEIN_ localization was further visualized by a cross section . to evaluate the capacity of the _PROTEIN_ protein to transport we introduced the _PROTEIN_ cdna driven by the root specific rold promoter into the _PROTEIN_ mutant background . the _PROTEIN_ mutant is largely defective for high affinity uptake as both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are not functional in this mutant . in addition we used rold _PROTEIN_ overexpressing mutant lines as a control . homozygous transgenic plants were grown for weeks in a hydroponic system on mm . root influx was measured at an external concentration of mm using . at this concentration the difference in the hats activity between the wild type and the _PROTEIN_ mutant was largest . the overexpression of the two genes _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was correlated with an increase in the root influx . quantitative rt pcr analyses confirmed that this increase in influx in the overexpressors was not due to compensation by altered _PROTEIN_ of other genes of the _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ family . increased acquisition in the _PROTEIN_ mutant plants complemented by either _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ can also be deduced from the increased content in shoots and the increased shoot _METHOD_ in these transgenic lines compared with the _PROTEIN_ mutant . to confirm that _PROTEIN_ is able to transport we used a heterologous _PROTEIN_ system . xenopus laevis oocytes were injected with either _PROTEIN_ mrna or nuclease free water . after d oocytes were incubated in a solution enriched with mm and the enrichment of individual oocytes was measured after h. these measurements showed that _PROTEIN_ mrna injected oocytes took up significantly more than water injected controls . in addition as _PROTEIN_ transport activity was dependent on coexpression with we tested uptake in oocytes by not only injecting _PROTEIN_ mrna alone but also together with mrna . _PROTEIN_ driven enrichment was independent of the presence of . to investigate the in planta function of _PROTEIN_ two knockout mutants were characterized . _PROTEIN_ corresponds to a t dna insertion line in the col background . the insertion of the t dna in the last exon of the _PROTEIN_ gene _PROTEIN_ led to a deletion of bp . _PROTEIN_ was obtained from the syngenta arabidopsis insertion library t dna insertion line collection . t dna insertion occurred in the third exon . no _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ could be detected by rt pcr for either mutant . neither mutant showed an obvious morphological or physiological phenotype in our growth conditions either under ample or under n starvation . we measured influx on _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutant seedlings that had been grown first for d on full n medium and were then transferred for d on medium without n. under these conditions _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was maximal in the wild type . we used concentrations from to mm and found no differences in influx between the wild type and mutants for and mm . however when supplying very low concentrations a significant _PROTEIN_ in influx was observed at both and mm external in both mutant lines . similar data have been obtained measuring depletion from the medium when plants were incubated for h in and mm solution . our data show that n starved _PROTEIN_ null mutants are impaired in uptake at very low concentrations suggesting that _PROTEIN_ is a transporter operating in the very high affinity range . it has been shown previously that the influx capacity of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ at low concentration was _PROTEIN_ but not zero . we therefore generated triple null mutants that are deficient for the three root high affinity transporters _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . we analyzed the fresh weight of the triple mutants _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in comparison to the double mutant _PROTEIN_ the single mutants _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and the wild type when grown on agar plates containing different _PROTEIN_ concentrations . no difference in fresh weight was observed for the single mutants compared with the wild type . as expected fresh weight of the double mutant _PROTEIN_ was lower than that of the wild type under all conditions tested . comparing triple and double mutants fresh weight was similar on mm but significantly _PROTEIN_ for the triple mutants grown on mm _PROTEIN_ agar plates . we then measured very high affinity influx on double and triple mutants that had been grown first for d on full n medium and were then transferred for d to medium without n. indeed influx was _PROTEIN_ in the triple mutants compared with the double mutant when measured in the presence of or mm external suggesting that the growth phenotype of triple mutant is attributed to reduced influx . although only the triple knockout of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ but not the single mutant _PROTEIN_ revealed a growth phenotype on low external this result demonstrates a role of _PROTEIN_ in sustaining plant growth at low n availability . since _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ in or close to the phloem of leaves the amount of in the phloem sap in the wild type and the mutants was compared . plants were grown on sand in short days for weeks on full n and then n starved for a further weeks . at that time the plants had been severely starved but were not yet flowering . levels in the phloem exudates of mature leaves were _PROTEIN_ by and in the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants respectively compared with the wild type . however the levels of amino acids in the phloem exudates were similar between the wild type and mutants suggesting that the rate of exudation is comparable between the wild type and mutants and that the effect was specific to . furthermore whole leaf levels were unchanged in the _PROTEIN_ mutants compared with the wild type . the _PROTEIN_ in content in phloem exudate was only observed when plants were cultivated under n starvation conditions . phloem exudate levels were similar for the wild type and mutants when plants were grown on ample . the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ the only other known transporter involved in shoot phloem content was not changed between the wild type and mutants . this result is in agreement with the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in veins and suggests a high affinity scavenging role for _PROTEIN_ in remobilization during n starvation in contrast with _PROTEIN_ which is involved in remobilization in the low affinity range .
