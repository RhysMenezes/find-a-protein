d hydroxyglutarate dehydrogenase catalyzes the specific and efficient oxidation of d hydroxyglutarate to oxoglutarate using fad as a cofactor . in this work we demonstrate that d localizes to plant mitochondria and that its _PROTEIN_ increases gradually during developmental and dark induced senescence in arabidopsis thaliana indicating an enhanced demand of respiration of alternative substrates through this enzymatic system under these conditions . using loss of function mutants in d _PROTEIN_ and stable isotope dilution lc _METHOD_ we found that the d isomer of accumulated in leaves of _PROTEIN_ during both _METHOD_ of _PROTEIN_ starvation . in addition to this _PROTEIN_ presented enhanced levels of most tca cycle intermediates and free amino acids . in contrast to the deleterious effects caused by a deficiency in d in humans _PROTEIN_ and overexpressing lines of d showed normal developmental and senescence phenotypes indicating a mild role of d in the tested conditions . moreover metabolic fingerprinting of leaves of plants grown in media supplemented with putative precursors indicated that d most probably originates during the catabolism of lysine . finally the l isomer of was also detected in leaf extracts indicating that both chiral _METHOD_ of participate in plant metabolism .
as it was previously suggested that d may participate in the catabolism of alternative substrates from proteolysis or lipid degradation its activity was analyzed in a. thaliana leaves during developmental aging and during continuous darkness where _PROTEIN_ starvation induces senescence . in gel activity analysis of wild type plants indicated that the activity of d increased gradually during natural senescence and after transfer to continuous darkness showing high levels by the end of both processes . the amount of ribulose bisphosphate _PROTEIN_ large subunit _PROTEIN_ in the last weeks of development and after transfer to continuous darkness reflecting enhanced protein degradation during the progress of senescence . during development transcript levels of d measured by quantitative rt pcr showed maximal accumulation week before the activity maximum suggesting stability of the d protein during the last week . a constant increase in the d transcript level was observed during dark induced _PROTEIN_ starvation indicating that the increase in d activity during this process is due to enhanced transcript accumulation . the onset of _PROTEIN_ starvation in these experiments was further verified by the accumulation of transcripts of _PROTEIN_ whose _PROTEIN_ is most specific for developmental senescence and of the dark induced senescence associated gene _PROTEIN_ . induction of the _PROTEIN_ and higher activity of d in the _PROTEIN_ stages of development and during dark induced _PROTEIN_ starvation suggest an increased production of the metabolite d under these conditions . in agreement with these results the _PROTEIN_ of the etf _PROTEIN_ system which transfers the electrons donated from d to the electron transport chain is also induced during dark induced starvation . as this electron transport system is also induced during oxidative stress we analyzed the activity of d in a. thaliana leaves exposed to agents causing oxidative stress such as nacl or the redox cycling herbicide methyl viologen . no differences in d activity were observed under these conditions suggesting that the production of d may not be enhanced under these conditions . the t dna insertion line _PROTEIN_ was shown in our previous work to lack all d activity . in this work the homozygous line _PROTEIN_ was also isolated . d mrna and activity were absent in these plants demonstrating that it is a true knock out line . both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were used to analyze the participation of d in the catabolism of d during the mobilization of alternative substrates . for this metabolic fingerprinting was conducted with wild type and loss of function plants during aging and during the first days of dark induced _PROTEIN_ starvation . the progress of leaf aging was accompanied by a continuous increase in the levels of in wild type and _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ plants . although the rate of accumulation was higher in the wild type the knock out mutants accumulated fold and fold higher steady state levels of in rosette and cauline leaves respectively . although no differences in the levels of the tca cycle intermediates citrate and fumarate were obvious between the genotypes the levels of malate and succinate were generally higher in the last weeks of development in the knock out mutants . the levels of many amino acids were significantly elevated in the knock out mutants in the last week of development . in correlation with the onset of developmental senescence the levels of asparagine aspartate glutamate alanine and serine _PROTEIN_ at _PROTEIN_ stages of development in the wild type whereas in the knock out mutants all these amino acids accumulated . on the other hand the levels of amino acid markers of senescence such as tryptophan phenylalanine and tyrosine rose with development in all genotypes but in the knock out mutants the markers accumulated to higher levels during the last weeks of development . aging rosette and cauline leaves from all genotypes harvested in the middle of the light period presented similar levels of most _PROTEIN_ with the exception of the free hexoses fructose and _PROTEIN_ which accumulated at higher levels in cauline leaves of _PROTEIN_ plants . it is worth mentioning that although all plant genotypes were grown and sampled together some metabolites showed the same relative change with respect to the wild type but with different intensity as in the case of in rosette leaves or responded differently in both knock out lines as in the case of in cauline leaves . the exact _METHOD_ underlying these minor differences between both knock out lines can not be inferred from the results of this study it can not be excluded that they are due to positional effects of the different t dna insertions in the d gene . during the course of dark induced _PROTEIN_ starvation no differences in sugar metabolism were observed between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and the wild type . the levels of mannose fructose _PROTEIN_ and sucrose declined rapidly during extended darkness in all genotypes . the tca cycle intermediates malate fumarate succinate and were increased after days in extended darkness . in the knock out mutants there was a substantial accumulation of most amino acids after extension of the normal dark period including those known as markers of senescence . by far the most striking difference between wild type and knock out plants was the high levels of in the knock out mutants after extension of the dark period . it is worth mentioning that although the rate of accumulation was higher in the wild type the relative levels in the knock out mutants were much higher . the high accumulation of in leaves of _PROTEIN_ during the course of _PROTEIN_ starvation was accompanied by enhanced levels of most tca cycle intermediates and free amino acids . the question arises as to what causes this accumulation in plants lacking d during both developmental and dark induced senescence . it may be due to an early onset of protein degradation in the _PROTEIN_ mutants and may explain the higher levels of tca cycle intermediates as their withdrawal for anabolic processes under _PROTEIN_ starvation should be damped down . interestingly in humans the deficiency of d is also accompanied by a moderate elevation of the levels of tca cycle intermediates . in mammalian _METHOD_ d was found to cause a dose dependent inhibition of cytochrome c oxidase activity which may inhibit the respiratory chain in vivo and may explain the observed accumulation of tca cycle intermediates . it is also conceivable that d may be mildly toxic to plant cells by competitively inhibiting glutamate and/or using enzymes including transaminases and/or dicarboxylic acid transporters . in this way the inhibition of transaminases would explain the observed accumulation of amino acids . on the other hand it is possible that after the onset of _PROTEIN_ starvation the inability to degrade d triggers a signal that induces the accelerated use of alternative substrates for respiration . this signal could be the accumulation of d or some other intermediate of the pathway producing d alone or in combination with low sugar levels . as it can not be excluded that not only d but also l accumulates in plant tissues the levels of d and l were measured by stable isotope dilution lc _METHOD_ and by gc _METHOD_ after derivatization with butanol . as shown in table d accumulated during the progress of dark induced senescence whereas the levels of l were similar in all genotypes and invariant during the progress of _PROTEIN_ starvation . these results not only confirm that d is the enantiomeric form of that accumulates in wild type and _PROTEIN_ plants but also show for the first time that l is also present in plant tissues . the metabolite quantification showed that during the progress of dark induced senescence a. thaliana wild type plants accumulated d . increments in the levels of d of fold and fold after and days in darkness in wild type plants together with the _PROTEIN_ that the activity of d increased gradually after transfer to continuous darkness indicate an enhanced demand of respiration of alternative substrates through this enzymatic system under these conditions . moreover this study indicates that wild type plants produced d at higher rates than the knock out mutants during the progress of dark induced _PROTEIN_ starvation and that the inability of the knock out mutants to convert d to is the cause of its high accumulation . the early onset of metabolic _METHOD_ of _PROTEIN_ starvation observed in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ plants is mild enough to cause no visible changes in the onset of senescence _METHOD_ in these plants compared with the wild type under all experimental conditions tested . this correlated with a similar decline in the maximal quantum efficiency of photosystem ii primary photochemistry of the knock out plants with _PROTEIN_ to the wild type during the course of senescence and no changes in the respiratory rate of the knock out plants with _PROTEIN_ to the wild type _PROTEIN_ in senescence a condition in which accumulates . the affinity of human d for d is high and the concentration of d in _LOCATION_ of healthy humans is . the importance of this enzyme in _PROTEIN_ low d levels is illustrated by the _PROTEIN_ that a serum concentration of d is enough to cause severe developmental impairment in patients with d . in contrast the km of a. thaliana d is indicating that plant tissues have higher steady state levels of d . taking into consideration the data from table and that cell water content is the levels of d in a. thaliana wild type leaves if homogenously distributed would be at least by the end of a normal night and after days in darkness . on the other hand the levels of d in leaves of knock out plants would reach values of at least and mm by the end of the night and after days in darkness respectively . however most of the cellular d is likely concentrated in the mitochondria and the in vivo concentrations of this substrate would thus be even higher . this together with the _PROTEIN_ that the phenotype of _PROTEIN_ plants does not differ from that of the wild type indicates that plants can cope with much higher levels of d than mammals . in silico analysis of the subcellular localization indicates that a. thaliana d contains an n terminal sequence that should direct the protein to mitochondria . furthermore we have previously shown that cellular fractions enriched in mitochondria have high levels of d activity . to experimentally confirm the localization of d in vivo tobacco plants were infiltrated with an _PROTEIN_ construct carrying the full length cdna of a. thaliana d in a translational fusion to _METHOD_ . microscopic analysis of protoplasts prepared from infiltrated leaves indicated that the green _METHOD_ of _METHOD_ perfectly matched the red _METHOD_ of the mitochondrial control targeting signal of saccharomyces cerevisiae cytochrome c oxidase iv fused to mcherry confirming the mitochondrial localization of d . here it is worth mentioning that d has already been found as a mitochondrial protein in both arabidopsis leaves and cell cultures in proteomic studies using _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . in this study _GENE_ was described as a glycolate dehydrogenase because of its close relatedness to _GENE_ which has been previously annotated as a glycolate dehydrogenase . however _GENE_ was subsequently shown to be a d lactate dehydrogenase which participates in the methylglyoxal pathway . to analyze the influence of a higher d activity during the progress of developmental and dark induced senescence non segregating transgenic lines overexpressing d were produced . total leaf extracts of selected lines contained an additional protein band with d activity corresponding to the transgenic enzyme . the lower mobility of the overexpressed enzyme is due to the _PROTEIN_ that this protein contains extra amino acids at the c terminal region because for its _PROTEIN_ the stop codon of the binary vector was used . stable isotope dilution lc _METHOD_ measurements indicated lower levels of d in the overexpressing plants than in the wild type after days in darkness reflecting the higher d activity in these plants . d overexpressing lines did not show any morphological alteration during normal growth or changes in the senescence _METHOD_ with _PROTEIN_ to wild type plants during the progress of developmental or dark induced senescence . these results indicate that the comparatively high d levels present in wild type plants is in no way detrimental despite being much higher than the levels detected in mammals . the continuous accumulation of d in the knock out plants during developmental senescence and after the onset of _PROTEIN_ starvation in continuous darkness undoubtedly indicates that d participates in the catabolism of d during the mobilization of substrates from proteolysis and/or lipid degradation . this is in agreement with previous results on gene coexpression analysis that indicated that the _PROTEIN_ of d parallels the that of genes involved in oxidation and the degradation of valine leucine and lysine . moreover the bifunctional enzyme lysine ketoglutarate reductase/saccharopine dehydrogenase containing the first two linked enzymes of the lysine catabolic pathway is _PROTEIN_ primarily in senescing tissues and under conditions of sugar starvation in which amino acids are converted into sugars . in this study to experimentally test this hypothesis a. thaliana wild type and _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ plants were grown in the presence of putative precursors of d and metabolic fingerprinting was conducted with whole rosettes . similar levels of d were found in all genotypes in the presence of different concentrations of propionate glyoxylate valine or isoleucine whereas a higher accumulation was determined in the knock out plants grown on medium supplemented with lysine . in plants supplemented with mm lysine relative levels of d of and were found in the wild type _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ respectively whereas plants supplemented with mm lysine showed relative levels of d of and in the wild type _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ respectively . thus d levels in leaves of knock out plants positively correlated with the concentration of lysine in the medium strongly indicating that the absence of d represents a bottleneck in the catabolism of this amino acid . although a higher accumulation of this lysine was not evident in the knock out plants with _PROTEIN_ to the wild type it is possible that some intermediates of the lysine catabolic pathway may accumulate in these plants . metabolic analysis of plants growing in media supplemented with different substrates indicated that lysine is the most probable substrate generating d in vivo as d levels in leaves of knock out plants positively correlated with the concentration of lysine in the media . in agreement with this a recent report on isotope tracer experiments performed with labeled lysine showed the accumulation of lysine breakdown products in isovaleryl coa dehydrogenase and d loss of function plants . the functional redundancy of these two enzymes for lysine breakdown may also explain the _PROTEIN_ that d knock out mutants did not show apparent developmental or senescence phenotypes as isovaleryl coa dehydrogenase may in part complement the lack of d activity . in this way d may play a minor role in plant metabolism in contrast to its counterpart in humans . despite the high similarity in the catabolic pathway of d in plant and mammalian mitochondria there are fundamental differences both in the origin of this metabolite and in how these _METHOD_ can cope with high levels of it . the analysis of d loss of function and overexpressor plants performed here indicated that changes in d levels have a mild impact on other plant metabolite pool sizes . moreover the higher tolerance of plant tissues to d as compared with mammals suggests that this metabolite may not be a compound with broad toxic effects but rather that it may be specifically toxic to certain enzymes or transporters . further studies of these differences in tolerance and comparison of the activity of proteins that may be inhibited by d will provide important insights into the mode of toxicity of d .
