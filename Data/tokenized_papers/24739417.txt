although several chloroplast rna splicing and ribosome maturation domain containing proteins have been characterized for intron splicing and rrna processing during chloroplast gene _PROTEIN_ the functional role of a majority of crm domain proteins in plant growth and development as well as chloroplast rna metabolism remains largely unknown . here we characterized the developmental and stress response roles of a _LOCATION_ encoded chloroplast protein harboring a single crm domain designated in arabidopsis thaliana . analysis of _METHOD_ fusion proteins revealed that is localized to chloroplasts . the loss of function t dna insertion mutants for displayed retarded growth and delayed senescence suggesting that plays a role in growth and development of plants under normal growth conditions . in addition mutants showed retarded seed germination and seedling growth under stress conditions . no alteration in the splicing patterns of intron containing chloroplast genes was observed in the mutant plants but the processing of and rrnas was abnormal in the mutant plants . importantly was determined to possess rna chaperone activity . these results suggest that the chloroplast targeted one of two arabidopsis genes encoding a single crm domain containing protein harbors rna chaperone activity and plays a role in the arabidopsis growth and stress response by affecting rrna processing in chloroplasts .
sixteen predicted crm domain family members occur in the arabidopsis genome and they are classified into four groups such as _PROTEIN_ subfamily _PROTEIN_ subfamily subfamily and subfamily . among the crm domain containing protein genes two genes encode proteins harboring a single crm domain and are classified into subfamily group _PROTEIN_ . we thus named as . the protein contains a highly conserved gxxg sequence in the c terminal half of the protein . the two single crm domain containing proteins share approximately amino acid sequence homology with each other . to examine whether the single crm domain proteins are conserved in dicotyledonous and monocotyledonous plants the amino acid sequences of single crm domain proteins in diverse plant species including arabidopsis zea mays medicago truncatula vitis vinifera hordeum vulgare sorghum bicolor and oryza sativa were compared . the results showed that family proteins share amino acid sequence homology among dicot and monocot plants and share > amino acid sequence homology among monocot plants suggesting that the single crm domain containing proteins are functionally conserved in dicots and monocots . the domain structure and cellular localization of . schematic presentation of the domain structure of the protein . the position of the crm domain with a conserved gxxg sequence is shown tp transit peptide . chloroplast localization of the protein in arabidopsis leaf . red signals indicate chloroplast auto _METHOD_ and green signals indicate _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . bar . images showing mitochondria and _METHOD_ _METHOD_ in root . images showing mitochondria chloroplast auto _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ _METHOD_ in leaf . bar . the crm proteins in arabidopsis and rice have been predicted to be targeted _PROTEIN_ to chloroplasts or mitochondria . to determine the subcellular localization of the cdna encoding was ligated in front of the green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ gene and _PROTEIN_ of the _METHOD_ fusion protein was investigated in transgenic arabidopsis plants . strong _METHOD_ signals were observed in chloroplasts . to examine whether is also localized to mitochondria arabidopsis mitochondria were stained with mito tracker that is a red _METHOD_ dye and stains mitochondria in live cells and the signals from _LOCATION_ in roots and chloroplasts in leaves were examined . the results showed that the signals from mitochondria did not overlap with the signals from chloroplasts and _METHOD_ signals were observed exclusively in chloroplasts . these results clearly indicate that is localized to chloroplasts . to determine the role of during plant growth and development the t dna insertion mutant lines in were obtained and their phenotypes were analyzed under normal and stress conditions . the absence of _PROTEIN_ in the knockout mutant lines was confirmed by rt pcr analysis . the wild type and mutant plants were grown in _METHOD_ medium or soil and their phenotypes were observed during the entire life cycle of the plants . growth of the wild type and mutant plants was not significantly different at days after germination . however growth of the plants was markedly different at _PROTEIN_ stages in that the size of the mutants was much smaller than that of the wild type plants at or dag . the difference in flowering time between the wild type and mutant plants was evident mutants flowered approximately days _PROTEIN_ than the wild type plants . although the mutants flowered much _PROTEIN_ than the wild type plants the size and number of leaves at the time of bolting were not different between the wild type and mutant plants suggesting that does not affect control of flowering time . no significant difference in plant height was observed between the wild type and mutant plants at the time of maturity . the root growth of the mutants was also retarded compared with that of the wild type plants . to determine whether the retarded root growth was due to the _PROTEIN_ in cell size or cell number the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ in the roots of the wild type and mutant plants were stained with fm dye and observed under confocal microscope . the results showed that the size of cells in mutants was much smaller than that in the wild type plants . the retarded growth phenotypes of the mutant plants recovered to normal phenotypes in the complementation lines . all of these observations clearly demonstrate that plays a role for normal growth of arabidopsis plants . because a recent study demonstrated that the growth retardation phenotypes of an arabidopsis mutant are closely related to abscisic acid biosynthesis and chloroplast rna metabolism _PROTEIN_ we wanted to determine aba levels in the wild type plants mutants and complementation lines using an immunoassay method . the results showed that levels of aba in mutants were approximately of those in the wild type plants . we also analyzed transcript levels of the genes including _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ that are involved in aba biosynthesis and found that the levels of _PROTEIN_ were significantly lower in mutants than in the wild type plants . these results suggest that the retarded growth phenotypes of mutants are related to impaired aba biosynthesis . phenotypes of mutant plants and complementation lines . growth of the wild type plants mutants and complementation line _PROTEIN_ at and days after germination . scale bar cm . the size and number of leaves at emergence of floral buds on dag . scale bar cm . root growth of the plants measured on dag . scale bar cm . the size of cells in the roots of the plants measured on dag . scale bar . the amount of aba was measured in day old plants and relative amount to wild type value is shown . transcript levels of aba biosynthesis related genes _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were measured in day old plants by real time rt pcr and relative _PROTEIN_ levels to wild type value are shown . the values are mean _PROTEIN_ obtained from five independent experiments and asterisk above the number indicates statistically different values between wt and mutant plants . with the observation that plays a role in the growth of arabidopsis we subsequently examined whether is involved in senescence . in the dark induced senescence assay it was evident that greening of the leaves of mutant plants was _PROTEIN_ for much longer compared with that of the wild type plants when they were incubated under dark conditions . total chlorophyll contents in mutant plants were much higher than those in the wild type plants . greening of the leaves of the complementation lines was similar to that of the wild type plants and the chlorophyll contents in the complementation lines were comparable with those in the wild type plants . these results suggest that plays a positive role in senescence . delayed senescence of mutant plants . rosette leaves from week old wild type mutants and complementation line _PROTEIN_ were floated in water in the dark for days . chlorophyll content was measured in the leaves of each plant days after dark induced senescence . the values are mean _PROTEIN_ obtained from three independent experiments and asterisks above the columns indicate statistically different values between wt and mutant plants . to determine whether plays a role in the plant response to environmental stresses the wild type mutants and complementation lines were grown in _METHOD_ medium supplemented with nacl for salt stress or with mannitol for dehydration stress or the plants were grown at for cold stress treatment . we first compared seed germination rates of the plants under normal and stress conditions . no differences were observed in seed germination rates between the wild type and mutant plants under normal conditions . however seed germination of mutants was retarded compared with that of the wild type and complementation lines under salt or cold stress conditions whereas seed germination rates of all three genotypes were similar to each other under dehydration stress conditions . seedling growth of mutants was also retarded compared with that of the wild type and complementation lines under salt or cold stress . these results show that affects seed germination and subsequent seedling growth of arabidopsis under salt or cold stress conditions . response of mutant plants to abiotic stresses . seed germination and seedling growth of wild type plant and mutants on _METHOD_ medium on _METHOD_ medium supplemented with mm nacl or on _METHOD_ medium at . germination rate was scored on the indicated days . the pictures were taken days after germination . scale bar cm . the crm domain containing proteins have been demonstrated to be involved in the splicing of group ii introns of chloroplast mrnas and trnas _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . therefore we first examined whether is involved in the splicing of intron containing genes in chloroplasts . splicing patterns of all intron containing chloroplast transcripts including mrnas and trnas were analyzed by rt pcr . the results showed that the splicing patterns of all intron containing chloroplast transcripts were not altered in mutants compared with those in the wild type plants suggesting that is not involved in intron splicing in chloroplasts . we next examined whether is involved in rrna processing . the levels of rrnas including and rrnas in the wild type mutant and complementation line were determined by northern blot analysis . to accurately determine relative levels of rrna transcripts northern blot analysis was repeated four times and the relative intensities of rrna bands in mutants and complementation lines compared with those in wild type were calculated . the results showed that the transcript levels of the and rrnas in mutants were comparable with those in the wild type plants . however the mature rrna transcript levels in mutant _PROTEIN_ compared with those in the wild type plants . in addition the levels of mature rrna _PROTEIN_ whereas the levels of precursor rrna increased in mutant . these abnormal levels of and rrnas observed in mutants were restored to wild type levels in the complementation line . these results indicate that affects the processing of and rrnas . splicing patterns of chloroplast transcripts and rrna processing in mutant plants . total rnas were extracted from week old wild type and mutant and the levels of intron containing chloroplast transcripts were analyzed by rt pcr . identical results were obtained from independent experiments and a representative result is shown . total rna was extracted from week old wild type mutants and complementation line _PROTEIN_ and was separated on a formaldehyde agarose gel . the levels of the processed products of and rrnas were determined by northern blot analysis using the probes corresponding to each gene represented by _PROTEIN_ lines below each gene . the relative intensities of rrna bands in mutants and complementation lines compared with those in wild type were calculated and values under each lane are means sd . rna processing and intron splicing require proper folding of rna substrates and many _PROTEIN_ that harbor rna chaperone activity play an important role during these cellular processes _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . because harbors a crm domain that is known as an rna binding module _PROTEIN_ we aimed to determine whether possesses rna chaperone activity . we first analyzed the complementation ability of in the cold sensitive e. coli mutant in which four cold shock proteins known as rna chaperones are deficient and is high sensitivity to lower temperatures _PROTEIN_ . when the cells harboring each construct were incubated at all cells grew well with no difference . however when the cells were exposed to cold shock at the cells _PROTEIN_ or cspa as a positive control grew well at low temperatures whereas the cells harboring the piniii vector did not grow at low temperatures . this result demonstrates that has the ability to complement rna chaperone deficient e. coli mutant cells suggesting that functions as an rna chaperone in e. coli under cold shock . rna chaperone activity of the protein . complementation ability of in e. coli mutant cells during cold shock . the diluted cultures of e. coli cells _PROTEIN_ cspa or piniii vector were spotted on lb agar plates and the cells were incubated at either or . dna melting ability of . _METHOD_ of the molecular beacons was measured after adding the recombinant _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ cspa or _PROTEIN_ proteins . transcription anti termination activity of . the e. coli _PROTEIN_ cells _PROTEIN_ each construct were spotted on lb agar medium with or without chloramphenicol and the cells were incubated at . to further confirm whether possesses rna chaperone activity the in vitro and in vivo _LOCATION_ acid melting abilities of were assessed via dna melting and transcription anti termination assays . for the analysis of in vitro dna melting ability of the recombinant _PROTEIN_ fusion proteins were purified from e. coli and _PROTEIN_ fusion protein was tested for its ability to destabilize base pairs in the synthetic dna molecules labeled with a fluorophore and quencher . _METHOD_ of the molecular beacon increased after adding the _PROTEIN_ proteins or the _PROTEIN_ cspa fusion proteins confirming the dna melting activity of . by contrast adding _PROTEIN_ alone did not increase _METHOD_ . to determine whether has the ability to destabilize base pairs in rna the in vivo rna melting ability of was assessed via transcription anti termination assays using e. coli _PROTEIN_ cells that harbor a chloramphenicol resistance gene downstream from a trpl terminator with stem loop structure _PROTEIN_ . when the _PROTEIN_ cells were grown in the _METHOD_ medium containing chloramphenicol the cells _PROTEIN_ or cspa grew well suggesting that and cspa destabilize the stem loop structures present in the transcription termination signal . by contrast the cells harboring the piniii vector did not grow in chloramphenicol containing _METHOD_ medium . taken together these results indicate that possesses rna chaperone activity .
the arabidopsis thaliana used in this study was col ecotype . the plants were grown either in a mixture of vermiculite peat moss and perlite or on half strength murasige skoog _METHOD_ medium containing sucrose at under long day conditions . to construct overexpressing transgenic plants and complementation lines the cdna coding sequence was cloned into the ncoi/bsteii of vector containing the cauliflower mosaic virus promoter . the arabidopsis transformation was carried out via vacuum infiltration using agrobacteruim tumefaciens . the transgenic lines were selected and subsequently utilized for the phenotype investigation . _PROTEIN_ of in each transgenic plant was analyzed by rt pcr using the gene specific primers listed in additional file . arabidopsis mutant seeds with t dna inserted into the gene were obtained from the arabidopsis biological resource center . the absence of _PROTEIN_ in the mutant lines was confirmed by rt pcr using the gene specific primers listed in additional file . to determine the cellular localization of the cdna corresponding to the full length was ligated using the xbai/bamhi site in front of the _METHOD_ gene and _METHOD_ fusion proteins were _PROTEIN_ under the control of the camv promoter in arabidopsis . the _METHOD_ signals in the leaves and roots of the plants were observed using a zeiss _PROTEIN_ laser scanning confocal microscope . the excitation and emission wavelengths were and nm respectively . mitochondria in the leaves and roots of the plants were stained with red cmxros . total rnas were extracted from frozen tissues using the plant rneasy extraction kit and the concentration of rnas was quantified by spectrophotomety . rt pcr was performed using the primers spanning the t dna insertion site to confirm whether the t dna tagged mutant seeds from _PROTEIN_ were knockout mutants . to examine splicing patterns of intron containing genes total rnas were extracted from week old plants and ng rna was used for rt pcr with the gene specific primers listed in additional file . to examine the _PROTEIN_ levels of aba biosynthesis related genes total rnas were extracted from day old plants and ng rna was used for quantitative real time rt pcr with the gene specific primers listed in additional file . ten _METHOD_ of plant tissues at dag were ground in liquid nitrogen mixed with an extraction solution and incubated overnight at . after centrifugation at g for min the pellet was dissolved in methanol and tbs . aba concentration was determined using aba test kit according to the manufacturer s instructions . total rna was extracted from week old wild type and mutant plants for chloroplast rrna processing analysis . five or ten _METHOD_ of total rna was electrophoresed on an agarose or formaldehyde gel blotted to a hybond n nylon _LOCATION_ and then cross linked under uv . hybridization with labeled probes was performed in _PROTEIN_ ssc denhardt s solution salmon sperm dna and formamide at overnight . the _LOCATION_ was washed times in ssc and _PROTEIN_ at room temperature and once in ssc and _PROTEIN_ at . the genes encoding chloroplast rrnas were cloned into the pgem t easy vector using the arabidopsis chloroplast sequence information and the hybridization probes were amplified by pcr from the chloroplast rdna cloned vector . the probes contained rdna sequences of the following region and _PROTEIN_ . the probes were labeled with dctp using the random primer dna labeling kit according to the manufacturer s instructions . for the cold shock and transcription anti termination assays in e. coli the piniii vector _PROTEIN_ was constructed essentially as described previously . in the cold shock assay the vector was introduced into e. coli mutant cells _PROTEIN_ that lack four cold shock proteins and thus are highly sensitive to cold stress . the mutant cells harboring either piniii piniii cspa or piniii were grown in luria bertani medium containing ampicillin and kanamycin and the serial diluted cultures of cells were spotted on lb medium and incubated at low temperature . in the transcription anti termination assay e. coli _PROTEIN_ cells _PROTEIN_ transformed with each construct were grown in liquid lb medium and spotted on lb _PROTEIN_ plates with or without chloramphenicol . growth of the cells was inspected on a daily basis . for in vitro dna melting assay the dna molecules labeled with a fluorophore and quencher were synthesized as previously described for the _PROTEIN_ and purification of recombinant _PROTEIN_ fusion proteins in e. coli the coding region of was cloned into pgex vector . the recombinant _PROTEIN_ fusion proteins were _PROTEIN_ in competent cells and purified using glutathione sepharose resin . the _METHOD_ emitted from the reaction between the _PROTEIN_ fusion proteins and the dna molecules was measured using a spectra max geminixs spectrofluorometer with excitation and emission wavelengths of nm and nm respectively .
