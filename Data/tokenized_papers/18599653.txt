the central cell of the female gametophyte plays a role in pollen tube guidance and in regulating the initiation of endosperm development . following fertilization the central cell gives rise to the seed 's endosperm which nourishes the developing embryo within the seed . the molecular _METHOD_ controlling specification and differentiation of the central cell are poorly understood . we identified _PROTEIN_ in a screen for transcription _PROTEIN_ genes _PROTEIN_ in the female gametophyte . _PROTEIN_ encodes a type i mads domain protein which likely functions as a transcription _PROTEIN_ . consistent with this an _PROTEIN_ green _METHOD_ protein fusion protein is localized to the _LOCATION_ . in the context of the ovule and seed _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ exclusively in the central cell and early endosperm . _PROTEIN_ female gametophytes are affected in the central cell specifically . the morphological defects include an overall reduction in size of the central cell and a reduced or absent central cell _LOCATION_ . when fertilized with wild type pollen _PROTEIN_ central cells fail to give rise to endosperm . in addition synergid and antipodal _PROTEIN_ genes are ectopically _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ central cells . the _PROTEIN_ pattern and mutant phenotype of _PROTEIN_ are similar to those of _PROTEIN_ suggesting that _PROTEIN_ may function as a heterodimer with _PROTEIN_ within the central cell consistent with this _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ interact in yeast two hybrid assays . together these data suggest that _PROTEIN_ functions as a transcription _PROTEIN_ and controls the _PROTEIN_ of downstream genes during central cell development .
we performed a screen to identify mads box genes _PROTEIN_ in the female gametophyte . we harvested ovaries from male _METHOD_ and determinant _PROTEIN_ extracted rna and used real time reverse transcription pcr to assay the _PROTEIN_ of genes within this gene family . _METHOD_ ovules are normal and _PROTEIN_ ovules lack female gametophytes thus genes exhibiting reduced _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ ovaries relative to _METHOD_ ovaries are likely to be _PROTEIN_ in the female gametophyte . these assays identified a gene _PROTEIN_ exhibiting reduced _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ ovaries relative to wild type ovaries . the structure of _PROTEIN_ is summarized in figure and the real time rt pcr data are provided in figure . to determine which cells within the female gametophyte _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ we generated and analyzed transgenic arabidopsis plants containing a protein fusion construct _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ comprising the _PROTEIN_ promoter and the entire _PROTEIN_ coding region fused with a _METHOD_ coding sequence . figure a to c show _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ during female gametophyte development . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was first detected in the two _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ just before fusion _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was not detected at earlier developmental stages . _PROTEIN_ in the central cell continued through stage _PROTEIN_ and into the mature stage _PROTEIN_ . during all of these stages the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein was localized to the _LOCATION_ consistent with a predicted function in transcriptional regulation . to determine whether _PROTEIN_ is also _PROTEIN_ in developing seeds we analyzed _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ at to h after pollination . during this period _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was detected exclusively in the endosperm . during endosperm development _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was strongest immediately after fertilization diminished gradually at progressively older stages and was not detected after the eight nucleate stage of endosperm development . in reciprocal crosses with plants homozygous for the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ construct and wild type _PROTEIN_ was detected only when the reporter construct was present in the female parent . we also analyzed _PROTEIN_ of an _PROTEIN_ promoter fusion construct _METHOD_ . as with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was _PROTEIN_ exclusively in the central cell and endosperm during female gametophyte and seed development . in contrast to _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ persisted until the nucleate stage of endosperm development . to determine whether _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ elsewhere in the plant we performed real time rt pcr with rna from various organs . the results from these assays are shown in figure . consistent with _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ in the female gametophyte strong _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was detected in ovaries . in addition weak _PROTEIN_ was detected in siliques which correlates with limited _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ during seed development and in _METHOD_ and anthers . _PROTEIN_ was not detected by real time rt pcr in roots leaves and young flowers . in summary during ovule and seed development _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ exclusively in the central cell and endosperm from _PROTEIN_ stage _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ of female gametophyte development to stage iv or v of endosperm development . elsewhere in the plant _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is extremely low or is not detected . to determine whether mutations in _PROTEIN_ affect the female gametophyte we analyzed lines containing t dna insertions in this gene . we analyzed two t dna alleles _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ which were obtained from the arabidopsis signal and gabi kat collections respectively . the t dna insertion sites in these mutants are shown in figure . to determine whether the _PROTEIN_ mutations affect the female gametophyte we crossed heterozygous mutant plants as females with wild type males and scored the number of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ progeny . table i shows that both mutations exhibited reduced transmission through the female gametophyte indicating that they affect the female gametophyte . segregation of the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutations to determine whether the _PROTEIN_ mutations also affect the male gametophyte we crossed heterozygous mutant plants as male parents with wild type females and scored the number of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ progeny . with both alleles homozygous wild type and heterozygous progeny were present in approximately equal proportions indicating that these mutations do not affect the male gametophyte . table i shows that the _PROTEIN_ mutations transmit through the female gametophyte at low frequency . based on the observed gametophytic transmission frequencies homozygous mutants should be present at a frequency of to . however homozygous mutants were not identified in > plants screened for each allele . these results along with the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ pattern suggest that the _PROTEIN_ mutations affect seed development . to confirm that the female gametophyte defect is due to disruption of _PROTEIN_ we introduced a wild type copy of this gene into the _PROTEIN_ mutant . we identified plants heterozygous for the _PROTEIN_ allele and hemizygous for the rescue construct these plants contained aborted seeds as compared to aborted seeds for _PROTEIN_ plants lacking the rescue construct . in the subsequent generation we identified plants heterozygous for the _PROTEIN_ allele and homozygous for the rescue construct these plants had full seed set . together these data indicate that disruption of the _PROTEIN_ gene is responsible for the female gametophyte defect in _PROTEIN_ mutants . to determine whether the _PROTEIN_ mutations affect megagametogenesis we analyzed _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ female gametophytes using confocal laser scanning microscopy _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ had similar phenotypes . here we report a description of _PROTEIN_ . we first analyzed female gametophytes at the terminal developmental stage _PROTEIN_ . we emasculated _PROTEIN_ flowers at stage waited h fixed ovule tissue for confocal analysis and analyzed > female gametophytes . of the observed female gametophytes approximately were normal and approximately were abnormal suggesting that that the abnormal female gametophytes corresponded to _PROTEIN_ . wild type female gametophytes at this stage have one egg cell one central cell and two synergid cells . in _PROTEIN_ female gametophytes at this stage the egg cell and synergid cells were indistinguishable from those of the wild type . by contrast _PROTEIN_ central cells exhibited several defects including an overall reduction in size and a reduced or absent _LOCATION_ . in addition the central cell _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ often was in an abnormal position in _PROTEIN_ central cells . to determine whether _PROTEIN_ female gametophytes are affected at earlier developmental stages we analyzed female gametophytes within stage flowers which contain embryo sacs at stages _PROTEIN_ to _PROTEIN_ . in flowers at this stage abnormal female gametophytes were not observed suggesting that _PROTEIN_ female gametophytes do not exhibit defects at these earlier stages . to characterize endosperm derived from fertilization of _PROTEIN_ central cells we pollinated _PROTEIN_ flowers with wild type pollen waited h and fixed seed tissue for confocal analysis . in the siliques resulting from this cross approximately of the seeds were normal and approximately were abnormal suggesting that that the abnormal seeds resulted from fertilization of _PROTEIN_ embryo sacs . in wild type seeds at h after pollination one of the synergid cells is degenerated the embryo is a single celled zygote and the endosperm typically consists of four to eight _LOCATION_ . in most of the abnormal seeds the embryo sac chamber was filled with highly _METHOD_ material . a minority of abnormal seeds had a few endosperm _LOCATION_ at abnormal positions and a zygote like structure . to further characterize the defects in _PROTEIN_ we used _METHOD_ microscopy to analyze development of _METHOD_ marked central cells and endosperm . we analyzed plants heterozygous for the _PROTEIN_ mutation and hemizygous for _METHOD_ which is _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ central cells and endosperm . in mature female gametophytes _PROTEIN_ defective central cells were readily apparent . of the female gametophytes _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ approximately contained abnormal central cells that resembled those described above the central cell _LOCATION_ was reduced in size or absent and the overall size of the central cell was dramatically reduced . at h after pollination with wild type pollen approximately of the seeds were defective and most of these had no endosperm . in summary _PROTEIN_ female gametophytes are defective in central cell development . _PROTEIN_ central cells are reduced in size and have collapsed _LOCATION_ but appear to be viable based on _PROTEIN_ of a central cell marker . fertilization of _PROTEIN_ female gametophytes with wild type sperm leads to aberrant endosperm development and eventually seed abortion . the _PROTEIN_ analysis discussed above suggests that the egg cell synergid cells and antipodal cells are not affected in _PROTEIN_ female gametophytes . to investigate this issue further we analyzed _PROTEIN_ of markers for these cell types in _PROTEIN_ embryo sacs . we analyzed _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ which is _PROTEIN_ exclusively in the antipodal cells and _METHOD_ which is _PROTEIN_ strongly in the synergid cells and weakly in the egg cell and central cell . in _PROTEIN_ female gametophytes _METHOD_ was _PROTEIN_ in the antipodal cells and _METHOD_ was _PROTEIN_ strongly in the synergid cells and weakly in the egg cell . these results suggest that the antipodal synergid and egg cells are normal in _PROTEIN_ embryo sacs . however in contrast to the wild type _METHOD_ was also _PROTEIN_ in the central cell of _PROTEIN_ embryo sacs . similarly _METHOD_ which was _PROTEIN_ weakly in wild type central cells was _PROTEIN_ strongly in _PROTEIN_ central cells . these data indicate that _PROTEIN_ is required for suppression of and _PROTEIN_ in the central cell and that an additional aspect of the _PROTEIN_ phenotype is misexpression of antipodal and synergid _PROTEIN_ genes . analysis of the ccg mutant suggests that the central cell is required for pollen tube guidance by the female gametophyte . however the _PROTEIN_ analysis of developing seeds discussed above suggests that _PROTEIN_ female gametophytes attract pollen tubes and become fertilized . to confirm these results we analyzed pollen tube growth to _PROTEIN_ female gametophytes . we observed pollen tubes using pollen from transgenic plants containing the _METHOD_ construct . _METHOD_ is _PROTEIN_ in the vegetative cell of the elongating pollen tube and upon pollen tube discharge a bolus of _METHOD_ is released into the degenerating synergid cell . we pollinated wild type and _PROTEIN_ pistils with _METHOD_ pollen and analyzed the resulting seeds at h after pollination . in the wild type pollinations approximately of the seeds contained a pollen tube in the micropyle and a _METHOD_ bolus in the embryo sac . similarly in the _PROTEIN_ pollinations approximately of the seeds contained a pollen tube in the micropyle and a _METHOD_ bolus in the embryo sac indicating that _PROTEIN_ female gametophytes can attract pollen tubes . to verify these observations we performed a similar analysis with central cells _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ which allowed us to directly observe mutant embryo sacs . at h after pollination with _METHOD_ pollen of _PROTEIN_ female gametophytes had a pollen tube in its micropyle and a _METHOD_ bolus in the embryo sac . together these data indicate that _PROTEIN_ female gametophytes are not defective in pollen tube guidance . autoregulation is a common feature of mads box genes . to determine whether _PROTEIN_ regulates its own _PROTEIN_ we compared _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ in wild type and _PROTEIN_ female gametophytes . we generated plants hemizygous for _METHOD_ and heterozygous for _PROTEIN_ and scored the number of wild type and _PROTEIN_ central cells _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . in these plants the percentage of central cells _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was approximately equal in wild type and _PROTEIN_ female gametophytes . furthermore the intensity of the _METHOD_ signal was approximately equal in wild type and _PROTEIN_ female gametophytes . together these data suggest that _PROTEIN_ does not regulate its own _PROTEIN_ . the phenotype of _PROTEIN_ female gametophytes resembles that of _PROTEIN_ female gametophytes and the two genes are _PROTEIN_ in a similar pattern suggesting that _PROTEIN_ may interact with _PROTEIN_ in the central cell . to address this issue we performed directed yeast two hybrid assays using full length _PROTEIN_ fused with the dna binding domain _PROTEIN_ or the activation domain _PROTEIN_ and full length _PROTEIN_ fused with these domains _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . figure shows that _PROTEIN_ bd and _PROTEIN_ ad interacted with _PROTEIN_ ad and _PROTEIN_ bd respectively to stimulate transcription of the and reporter genes . by contrast control cells containing constructs paired with empty vectors did not activate transcription of the reporter genes . these data indicate that _PROTEIN_ interacts with _PROTEIN_ in yeast .

includes internodes from week old plants . anthers were collected from flowers at stages to . rna extractions cdna synthesis and real time rt pcr were performed as described in citation . each _PROTEIN_ value is the result of three independent pcr reactions including technical and biological replicates . the pcr primers used were f _PROTEIN_ and r . we calculated relative _PROTEIN_ levels as follows . we first normalized _PROTEIN_ transcript levels relative to a standard using the formula ct _PROTEIN_ ct . we next calculated an average value for each tissue . _METHOD_ pistil tissue with the highest relative _PROTEIN_ was used as the standard for comparison of _PROTEIN_ levels . we then calculated relative _PROTEIN_ levels using the equation average _METHOD_ . we identified the and untranslated sequences with _PROTEIN_ using the first choice rlm _PROTEIN_ kit . for _PROTEIN_ the gene specific outer primer was _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and the gene specific inner primer was _PROTEIN_ . for _PROTEIN_ the gene specific outer primer was and the gene specific inner primer was _PROTEIN_ . this analysis showed that _PROTEIN_ contains and untranslated regions of bp and bp respectively . to amplify a cdna encompassing the entire open reading frame of _PROTEIN_ we used the rlm _PROTEIN_ kit outer primer and _PROTEIN_ cdna r _PROTEIN_ . the cdna was cloned into the pcrii topo vector using the topo ta cloning kit resulting in plasmid pcrii . we used prosite to identify predicted functional domains of _PROTEIN_ protein . this prediction tool identified the mads domain but no other domains . we used psort wolf psort _METHOD_ and predictnls to identify a _LOCATION_ localization signal in _PROTEIN_ protein no putative nls was predicted . the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ construct includes a bp fragment containing bp of sequence upstream of the predicted translational start codon and bp of _PROTEIN_ genomic coding sequence excluding the stop codon . this genomic region was obtained by pcr amplification from genomic dna using the primers and . these primers introduced sali and bamhi sites at the and ends respectively . the resulting pcr product was cloned into pbi _METHOD_ using the sali and bamhi sites resulting in plasmid pbi _METHOD_ . the _METHOD_ construct includes bp upstream of the predicted translational start codon . this genomic region was obtained by pcr amplification from genomic dna using the primers _PROTEIN_ f and _PROTEIN_ r . these primers introduced psti and bamhi sites at the and ends respectively . the resulting pcr product was cloned into pbi _METHOD_ using the psti and bamhi sites resulting in the plasmid pbi _METHOD_ . these constructs were introduced into arabidopsis plants as described above and transformed plants were selected by germinating seeds on growth medium containing kanamycin . the _PROTEIN_ patterns reported in results are derived from the analysis of at least transgenic lines . for analysis of mature female gametophytes we emasculated flowers at stage waited h and removed the flowers from the plants . we then removed the sepals _PROTEIN_ and stamens and dissected off the carpel walls using a gauge syringe needle . for analysis of earlier developmental stages we directly dissected the ovules from stage flowers . for analysis of developing seeds we emasculated flowers at stage waited h pollinated with self pollen waited to h and then dissected the tissue as described above . in all cases the dissected ovules/seeds were mounted on microscope slides in mm phosphate buffer for microscopic analysis . _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ patterns were analyzed using a zeiss axioplan microscope . _METHOD_ was excited using a uv lamp and was detected using a he _METHOD_ filter set . images were captured using an axiocam mrm _PROTEIN_ camera with the axiovision software package version . for both alleles the left border and right border t dna junctions were determined by pcr using t dna specific and genomic specific primers . for _PROTEIN_ the left border junction was determined using the t dna primer _PROTEIN_ combined with the genomic primer _PROTEIN_ and the right border junction was determined using t dna primer _PROTEIN_ and genomic primer _PROTEIN_ . for _PROTEIN_ the left border junction was determined using the t dna primer combined with the genomic primer _PROTEIN_ and the right border junction was determined using the t dna primer combined with the genomic primer _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . the t dna in _PROTEIN_ is inserted nucleotides upstream of the transcriptional start site which is nucleotides upstream of the predicted start codon and is associated with a nucleotide deletion . the t dna in _PROTEIN_ is inserted nucleotides downstream of the transcriptional start site which is immediately upstream of the predicted start codon and is associated with a nucleotide insertion of unknown origin . for self cross analysis heterozygous plants were allowed to self pollinate and progeny seed was collected . for reciprocal cross analysis heterozygous plants were crossed with wild type plants as outlined in table i . in both cases the progeny seed was germinated on growth medium containing no antibiotics and progeny seedlings were genotyped and scored using pcr . plants segregating the _PROTEIN_ allele were genotyped using primers _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . plants segregating the _PROTEIN_ allele were genotyped using primers _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . heterozygous plants identified by pcr were used in the segregation analysis described below . table i shows that the _PROTEIN_ mutations transmit through the female gametophyte at low frequency . based on the observed transmission frequencies homozygotes should be present at a frequency of to . to identify homozygotes for both mutants we screened the siliques of > progeny from self pollinated heterozygous plants . in addition for both mutants we genotyped > of these plants using pcr with primers _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . with both methods plants homozygous for the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ alleles were not identified . molecular complementation was performed using a bp dna fragment containing the _PROTEIN_ coding sequence along with bp of sequence upstream of the predicted translational start codon and bp of sequence downstream of the stop codon . this dna fragment was amplified by pcr from genomic dna using the primers _PROTEIN_ resf _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ resr _PROTEIN_ . these primers introduced ecori and sali sites at each end respectively . the resulting pcr product was cloned into using the ecori and sali sites producing plasmid _PROTEIN_ res . contains a marker gene conferring resistance to hygromycin . _PROTEIN_ res was introduced into arabidopsis plants as described above and transformed plants were selected by germinating seeds on growth medium containing hygromycin . hygromycin resistant plants also containing the _PROTEIN_ allele were identified by pcr by using primers _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . to verify that hygromycin resistant plants had the rescue construct we performed pcr using primers pcamlaczr and _PROTEIN_ . these plants had aborted seeds . four plants identified above were allowed to self pollinate . in the generation plants containing the _PROTEIN_ allele and the rescue construct were identified by pcr using primers _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ pcamlaczr and _PROTEIN_ . these plants were screened for siliques containing full seed set . plants with full seed set putatively were homozygous for the rescue construct to verify this we collected seed from these plants and scored progeny seedlings for the presence of the rescue construct by pcr using primers pcamlaczr and _PROTEIN_ . we used the _PROTEIN_ matchmaker two hybrid system for the yeast two hybrid analysis . the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ open reading frames were fused to the activation domain and dna binding domain in pgad and pgbk . yeast strain was cotransformed with combinations of pgad and pgbk constructs _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and selected on synthetic dropout medium lacking leu and trp . cotransformants were then assayed for interaction and activation of the his and adenine reporter genes on sd medium lacking leu trp his and adenine . for this fresh colonies were grown in sd lw at overnight to an od of to the cells were pelleted and resuspended in m sorbitol to an od of and of each cell suspension was spotted on sd lwha plates using a multichannel pipetor and grown at for to d. in this analysis the second _PROTEIN_ was used as the start codon . _PROTEIN_ plants were crossed as males with plants homozygous for the promoter reporter constructs . to identify plants containing the _PROTEIN_ t dna allele pcr was performed with primers _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . seed was plated on growth medium containing kanamycin to identify seedlings containing the promoter reporter constructs . plants heterozygous for the _PROTEIN_ mutation and hemizygous for the promoter reporter construct were allowed to self cross . progeny from the self cross were then scored for the _PROTEIN_ t dna insertion by pcr as described above . one quarter of these plants should also be homozygous for the promoter reporter construct . to identify these plants we made use of the _PROTEIN_ that all promoter reporter constructs were inserted into vectors conferring kanamycin resistance . offspring containing the _PROTEIN_ t dna allele were then allowed to self cross . seed from this cross was plated on media containing kanamycin and the ratio of kanamycin sensitive to kanamycin resistant seedlings was scored . plants that produced kanamycin resistant progeny were determined to be homozygous for the reporter construct . the genbank accession number for the _PROTEIN_ mrna sequence is . the following materials are available in the online version of this article . supplemental figure . silique
