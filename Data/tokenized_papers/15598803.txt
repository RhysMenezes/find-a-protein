six genes of the arabidopsis thaliana monosaccharide transporter like _METHOD_ superfamily share significant homology with polyol transporter genes previously identified in plants translocating polyols in their phloem . the physiological role and the functional properties of this group of proteins were unclear in arabidopsis which translocates sucrose and small amounts of raffinose rather than polyols . here we describe _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ the first member of this subgroup of arabidopsis _METHOD_ like transporters . transient _PROTEIN_ of an _PROTEIN_ green _METHOD_ protein fusion in plant cells and functional analyses of the _PROTEIN_ protein in yeast and xenopus oocytes demonstrate that _PROTEIN_ is located in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and characterize this protein as a broad spectrum h symporter for linear polyols such as sorbitol xylitol _LOCATION_ or glycerol . unexpectedly however _PROTEIN_ catalyzes also the transport of the cyclic polyol myo inositol and of different hexoses and pentoses including ribose a sugar that is not transported by any of the previously characterized plant sugar transporters . rt pcr analyses and _PROTEIN_ promoter reporter gene plants revealed that _PROTEIN_ is most strongly _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis roots but also in the vascular tissue of leaves and in specific floral organs . the potential physiological role of _PROTEIN_ is discussed .
the open reading frames of the six putative polyol transporter genes from arabidopsis had been predicted from in silico analyses of the arabidopsis genome . to prove or disprove these predictions cdnas covering the entire orfs were generated by rt pcr from whole plant mrna and sequenced . because of their homology to the previously described pmplt genes from plantago the arabidopsis genes were named atplts _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . the obtained cdna sequences confirmed the predicted and deduced protein sequences of and _PROTEIN_ . for two different orfs had been predicted one with amino acids and one with amino acids . our analyses clearly confirmed the shorter orf encoding the amino acid protein . we were not able to isolate a cdna for _PROTEIN_ . the corresponding gene is predicted to encode the shortest atplt protein with only amino acids . the predicted _PROTEIN_ intron after bp of the _PROTEIN_ orf was confirmed by the sequence of a full length cdna obtained during the large scale cdna sequencing of clones isolated from a hormone treated callus . however this clone differs strongly from the genomic _PROTEIN_ sequence in a downstream region of nucleotides and yields the quite likely incorrect protein size of amino acids . figure presents a phylogenetic tree based on the experimentally confirmed protein sequences of to _PROTEIN_ and on the predicted sequence of _PROTEIN_ . clearly and which are encoded by adjacent genes on chromosome show the highest degree of sequence conservation suggesting that one of these genes formed during a recent duplication event . the most distant member of the family shares only identical amino acids with all other atplts . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ share to identity . hydropathy analyses of the protein sequences predicted transmembrane helices for all atplt proteins and characterized them as a separate group within the arabidopsis monosaccharide transporter like _METHOD_ superfamily . the different lengths of the atplt proteins result _PROTEIN_ from differences in the n and c termini with _PROTEIN_ having the longest c terminus having the longest n terminus and _PROTEIN_ having both the shortest n terminus and the shortest c terminus . the identity values determined for atplts and polyol transporters from other species are quite similar indicating the high degree of sequence conservation between these proteins from different plant species . to determine the functional properties of this new family of arabidopsis transporters we cloned the cdna of _PROTEIN_ into the unique ecori site of the yeast _PROTEIN_ vector _PROTEIN_ e and used the resulting plasmids harboring cdna inserts in sense or antisense orientation to transform the yeast strain _PROTEIN_ . the resulting yeast strains _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were used to study the possible sorbitol and mannitol transport capacity of the recombinant _PROTEIN_ protein . for optimal _PROTEIN_ results the flanking regions of the _PROTEIN_ cdna were modified . to this end a bp fragment from the untranslated region of the high affinity monosaccharide h symporter gene _PROTEIN_ was inserted in front of the start _PROTEIN_ . this short sequence is known to act as a perfect untranslated region in yeast and has been used successfully to enhance the _PROTEIN_ of otherwise poorly _PROTEIN_ plant cdnas in yeast . figure shows that cells imported labeled sorbitol at a high rate whereas no uptake of sorbitol was seen in antisense cells . however in contrast with all previously described polyol transporters the _PROTEIN_ protein did not seem to transport labeled mannitol . as for other h symporters we analyzed the uptake of sorbitol in the presence and absence of _PROTEIN_ a metabolizable _PROTEIN_ source for yeast cells that is expected to enhance proton motive force dependent transport rates by providing additional energy for the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ h _PROTEIN_ . in contrast with what has been shown for the polyol transporters and from common plantain sorbitol transport by _PROTEIN_ was inhibited by _PROTEIN_ . the obvious interpretation for this observed inhibition was that _PROTEIN_ may also be a substrate of _PROTEIN_ . to test this hypothesis we transformed the yeast strain eby.vw with the plasmids and yielding strains _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . because of multiple gene disruptions eby.vw has no endogenous _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ transporters for d _PROTEIN_ and can therefore be used to analyze the _PROTEIN_ transport capacity of recombinant transporters . figure shows that _PROTEIN_ catalyzes the uptake of labeled _PROTEIN_ in whereas no transport of _PROTEIN_ is seen in the antisense strain confirming that both sorbitol and _PROTEIN_ are substrates of _PROTEIN_ . this capacity to transport sugars has not been described for any of the previously published plant polyol transporters . for further analyses of the substrate specificity we studied the uptake of sorbitol in cells in the presence or absence of other potential substrates . we tested the inhibitory effect of the disaccharide sucrose of hexoses and pentoses of linear polyols with different chain lengths _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and of the cyclic polyol myo inositol . table shows that uptake of sorbitol was significantly inhibited by many of the tested competitors suggesting that _PROTEIN_ may represent a transporter with an unusually wide spectrum of substrates . unlabeled sorbitol _PROTEIN_ but also linear polyols with five four _LOCATION_ or three _PROTEIN_ strongly reduced the import of labeled sorbitol indicating that _PROTEIN_ accepts a wide range of linear polyols . inhibition by a fold excess of mannitol was less pronounced and inhibition by a fold excess of dulcitol was only . this suggested that despite the negligible rates of mannitol transport in cells there may be some mannitol uptake by cells . no inhibitory effect was seen for the two _PROTEIN_ polyol glycol and for methanol . inhibition of sorbitol uptake by various potential competitors or inhibitors in cells unexpectedly strong inhibition of sorbitol uptake was observed also in the presence of a fold excess of myo inositol of different pentoses such as xylose and arabinose and even of ribose which _METHOD_ a furanose _PROTEIN_ . no significant inhibition was obtained in the presence of the disaccharide sucrose . table also shows the sensitivities of _PROTEIN_ dependent transport to uncouplers such as _PROTEIN_ cyanide m chlorophenylhydrazone and dinitrophenol and the effect of the sh group inhibitor p benzene sulfonic acid . clearly both uncouplers strongly reduced the transport rates suggesting that _PROTEIN_ may catalyze the energy dependent h symport of sorbitol across the yeast _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . by contrast pcmbs had no inhibitory effect on _PROTEIN_ dependent transport . this agrees with the results published for most of the polyol transporters from polyol translocating plants . pcmbs sensitivity was found only for and in this case the sensitivity could be attributed to cys residue in this protein . none of the atplt proteins have a cys residue at the corresponding position _PROTEIN_ which explains the lack of pcmbs sensitivity . to confirm that the reduced transport rates in the presence of other polyols or sugars result indeed from competition for transport we analyzed _PROTEIN_ dependent uptake for selected radiolabeled competitors . in _PROTEIN_ all of the tested monosaccharides turned out to be transported by _PROTEIN_ at similar rates . this was an important observation because so far significant transport rates for ribose have not been shown for any of the high affinity _PROTEIN_ like monosaccharide transporters from arabidopsis . figure shows _PROTEIN_ driven uptake also for glycerol and even for mannitol when analyzed in cells . together with the competition analyses in table this demonstrates that _PROTEIN_ can transport linear polyols with chain lengths of three to six _PROTEIN_ . so far energy dependent uptake _METHOD_ for glycerol have not been described for plant cells . the low rates of mannitol transport correlate with its small inhibitory effect on sorbitol uptake and with the almost undetectable mannitol transport rates seen in figure . obviously _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ to higher levels in cells than in cells . this difference is attributable to the two yeast strains used for these _PROTEIN_ analyses _PROTEIN_ . unexpectedly even inositol was transported with higher rates by cells than by antisense cells . however a rather high inherent transport activity for this substrate was also seen in control cells . the km values of recombinant _PROTEIN_ in yeast were determined for sorbitol and _PROTEIN_ . these values agree with slightly higher sorbitol transport for sorbitol than for _PROTEIN_ . these data also show that the km value for _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ is clearly higher than the km values previously determined for the members of the high affinity atstp monosaccharide transporters having km values for _PROTEIN_ between and . the _PROTEIN_ that sorbitol can be accumulated by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ yeast cells to intracellular concentrations exceeding the initial outside concentrations as well as the sensitivity of _PROTEIN_ driven polyol transport to uncouplers provides indirect evidence for an energy dependent uptake mechanism . for a direct analysis of its energy dependence and for further analyses of its substrate specificity _PROTEIN_ was analyzed in xenopus oocytes injected with _PROTEIN_ crna . figure shows that similar inward currents were obtained upon perfusion with mm solutions of sorbitol _PROTEIN_ fructose and myo inositol at an _LOCATION_ ph of . smaller currents were observed in the presence of mm glycerol and currents almost zero in the presence of mannitol . this and the normalized values shown in figure confirm the yeast data for sorbitol and _PROTEIN_ transport and demonstrate that fructose and inositol also are transported at similar rates . by contrast and in agreement with the data obtained in the yeast expession system glycerol is transported at a clearly lower rate . these data confirm that _PROTEIN_ is also a transporter for myo inositol and glycerol two substrates that inhibited the uptake of sorbitol in yeast but yielded only low transport rates or were difficult to analyze because of a strong inherent transport activity . the results also confirm that in contrast with all previously described polyol transporters _PROTEIN_ does discriminate between sorbitol and mannitol . finally the obtained inward currents demonstrate that a positive charge is symported with each of the tested substrates confirming the interpretation that _PROTEIN_ driven transport is energy dependent . figures and show the michaelis menten kinetics of _PROTEIN_ for myo inositol and glycerol in xenopus oocytes . the km values were determined at mv and at an _LOCATION_ ph of and were mm for myo inositol and mm for glycerol . additional analyses of the km values for myo inositol from to mv revealed that it is voltage dependent and increases with more negative potentials . at mm the km of _PROTEIN_ for myo inositol is mm . the nature of the cotransported ion was characterized for _PROTEIN_ and glycerol . in na free buffer _METHOD_ inward currents induced by both substrates increased with _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ ph values indicating that the cotransported ions are protons and characterizing _PROTEIN_ as an h symporter . figures and show that at _LOCATION_ ph values > the activity of _PROTEIN_ is almost zero . an identical ph dependence was obtained for sorbitol uptake in yeast where transport rates for sorbitol at ph and ph differed > . both in the yeast system and in the xenopus system _PROTEIN_ activity was clearly localized to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ in plant cells was analyzed by transient _PROTEIN_ of an _PROTEIN_ construct that carried an in frame _METHOD_ fusion at its end . to this end the plasmid that drives _PROTEIN_ of this _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion under the control of an enhanced promoter was used for transient _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis and onion epidermis cells after transformation with a self made particle inflow gun . analyses of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ arabidopsis and onion epidermis cells with a confocal microscope showed that _METHOD_ resulting from this fusion is confined to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . thus _PROTEIN_ is s _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ localized h symporter . for analysis of the tissue specificity of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ we generated and analyzed _PROTEIN_ promoter gus and _PROTEIN_ promoter _METHOD_ plants . a bp promoter fragment was used to drive the _PROTEIN_ of gus or _METHOD_ in plants that had been selected for _PROTEIN_ resistance after transformation with the plasmids _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . we obtained numerous gus or _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ transformants and analyzed independent _PROTEIN_ promoter gus lines and independent _PROTEIN_ promoter _METHOD_ lines . figures to show the typical gus staining found in rosette leaves of _PROTEIN_ promoter gus plants . in all plants analyzed and in most leaves of these plants gus staining was detected in or along the vascular tissue . however typically this staining which was frequently seen only after a prolonged period of staining was patchy and often more or less absent from the midrib . in other leaves however gus staining was observed _PROTEIN_ in the midrib and sometimes the leaves stayed completely white . weak gus staining was also seen along the vascular strands of _METHOD_ of all sepals and of siliques . siliques typically showed an additional more general staining near both ends . distinct _PROTEIN_ promoter activity was also seen in the axillary regions of all flowers . in none of the tested lines was gus staining seen in seeds pollen or _PROTEIN_ . in of the plants the strongest gus staining was detected over a distance of to behind the root tip . weaker gus staining was also seen in the upper part of most roots . only this strong gus activity in the tip regions could was detected in analyses of _PROTEIN_ promoter _METHOD_ plants . leaf or flower specific _PROTEIN_ has not been found in any of the _METHOD_ lines suggesting that _PROTEIN_ in these tissues is much weaker than in roots . three anti _PROTEIN_ antisera were raised against the peptide ceigsnkqwkegdtqss _PROTEIN_ that corresponds to amino acids to from the very c terminus of _PROTEIN_ . this sequence is unique to _PROTEIN_ and is lacking in all other atplt proteins with shorter c terminal sequences . the quality of the obtained sera was tested on detergent extracts from total _LOCATION_ isolated from and yeast cells . figure shows a protein gel blot of these extracts after gel chromatographic separation and incubation with . a strong signal at an apparent molecular _METHOD_ of kd and a weaker signal at kd were detected only in cells and were absent in similar extracts from controls indicating that these bands represent the monomeric form and the most likely dimerized form of the _PROTEIN_ protein . the difference of kd between the apparent molecular _METHOD_ of the monomeric form and the calculated molecular _METHOD_ of kd as well as the appearance of a dimer is typical for highly lipophilic proteins . similar results were obtained with the other anti _PROTEIN_ antisera . separation of the yeast total _LOCATION_ fraction into a _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ enriched fraction and an endomembrane enriched fraction localized the majority of the label to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . the small amount of _PROTEIN_ protein detected in the endomembrane fraction is likely to result from contaminating _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ in this fraction . this localization was confirmed in immunohistochemical analyses of and cells where signals were detected only at the cell surface of the sense strain . no signals were seen in sections of antisense cells . the antisera were also used in numerous attempts to immunolocalize _PROTEIN_ in sections of arabidopsis roots and leaves . unfortunately the antisera gave no signals with different embedding and fixation protocols . in view of the specific and strong signals obtained in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ yeast cells we speculate that the amount of _PROTEIN_ protein in planta is too low for immunohistochemical detection . to confirm the tissue specific _PROTEIN_ shown in figure by an independent technique we performed light cycler rt pcr analyses of _PROTEIN_ mrna levels in different tissues . parallel reactions were performed with _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ standards to minimize potential tissue specific differences in the _PROTEIN_ levels of a single control . figure gives the data calculated with the _PROTEIN_ control results calculated with the are not shown because they were almost identical . the results show only minor differences in _PROTEIN_ mrna levels of the analyzed tissues suggesting that there may be low _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ also in cells and tissues that are not stained in the _PROTEIN_ promoter gus or _PROTEIN_ promoter _METHOD_ plants . moreover these data confirm the higher levels of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in the distal regions of the roots which were also seen in the _PROTEIN_ promoter reporter gene plants . screening of publically available libraries identified a mutant line carrying a t dna insertion in the exon of the _PROTEIN_ gene bp after the start _PROTEIN_ . an insertion at this position results in a truncated _PROTEIN_ mrna containing only bp of the _PROTEIN_ orf . this mrna is predicted to encode a protein of only amino acids . in the wild type _PROTEIN_ protein the c terminal amino acids that are lacking in the truncated mutant protein encode transmembrane helix number and a predicted cytoplasmic c terminus of amino acids . the full length mrna was no longer present in the mutant line . the truncated _PROTEIN_ mrna was however identified using primers binding in front of the t dna insertion . for the reasons given above it is not likely that this mrna encodes a functional protein . when the phenotypes of this mutant line and of the corresponding wild type plants were compared we observed no differences in the growth phenotype under ambient _PROTEIN_ concentrations and under the normal growth conditions described in methods . growth of mutant and wild type plants was also compared under salt stress under drought stress on soil and finally on petri plates in the presence or absence of one of the transported substrates . under none of these conditions was a significant difference in plant growth or development observed .
arabidopsis thaliana plants were grown in growth chambers on potting soil under a h h dark regime at and relative humidity or in the greenhouse under ambient conditions . for heterologous _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ cdnas in yeast we used strains _PROTEIN_ or eby.vw . the escherichia coli strain was used for all cloning steps . transformation of arabidopsis was performed using agrobacterium tumefaciens strain . cdnas of the six arabidopsis atplt genes were amplified from total rna isolated from arabidopsis columbia with gene specific primers binding to the very ends _PROTEIN_ or the very ends of the cdnas . noti cloning sites were introduced at both ends of and and ecori cloning sites were introduced at both ends of and _PROTEIN_ . the resulting cdnas were digested with noti or ecori cloned into the respective sites of the yeast _PROTEIN_ vectors _PROTEIN_ e or _PROTEIN_ n and sequenced and the _PROTEIN_ containing plasmid used for transformation of yeast cells . if not otherwise indicated uptake experiments were performed in mm sodium phosphate buffer ph as described . for functional analysis _PROTEIN_ crna was prepared using the mmessage mmachine rna transcription kit . oocyte preparation and crna injection have been described elsewhere . in two electrode voltage clamp studies oocytes were perfused with mm kcl containing solutions based on tris/mes buffers for ph values from to . the standard solution contained mm tris ph mm kcl mm and mm . osmolarity was adjusted to mosmol/kg using sucrose . the content of substrates and the ph values are indicated in the figures and figure legends . steady state currents were recorded with single pulse protocols to _METHOD_ test voltages from to mv from a holding potential of mv . currents in the absence of substrates were subtracted for leak correction . a bp promoter _PROTEIN_ promoter fragment was pcr amplified from genomic dna using the primers _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . the fragment was cloned into pgem t easy and sequenced and the insert was cloned in front of the _METHOD_ reporter gene in the vector or in front of the gus reporter gene in the vector _METHOD_ . from the resulting plasmids _PROTEIN_ promoter _METHOD_ or _PROTEIN_ promoter gus fragments were excised and cloned into _PROTEIN_ yielding the plasmids _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ which were used for transformation of arabidopsis . the transient _PROTEIN_ plasmid was generously provided by m. _LOCATION_ . it was made from _PROTEIN_ a based plasmid containing the _PROTEIN_ promoter the _METHOD_ orf _PROTEIN_ and the nopaline synthase terminator . the _PROTEIN_ promoter of _PROTEIN_ was replaced by the bp hindiii/bamhi fragment representing the enhanced promoter from . the _PROTEIN_ coding sequence was pcr amplified using the primers _PROTEIN_ ncoi and _PROTEIN_ ncoi . these primers introduced an ncoi site in front of the _PROTEIN_ start _PROTEIN_ and a second ncoi site after the last amino acid of the _PROTEIN_ orf . this second ncoi site also replaced the stop codon of the original _PROTEIN_ sequence . the modified _PROTEIN_ orf was inserted into the unique ncoi cloning site covering the start _PROTEIN_ of the _METHOD_ orf in the plasmid . the correct insertion was confirmed by sequencing the resulting plasmid was named . for transient _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ from mg of surface sterilized gold particles were resuspended in of water and mixed with of dna . to this mixture m and of m spermidin were added . after the stepwise addition of ethanol and of ethanol the mixture was kept at for min and centrifuged for min at and gold particle attached dna was resuspended in of water . for bombardment of the dna/gold solution were pipetted on a filter that was placed into the discharge assembly of a vacuum chamber . the lower epidermis of arabidopsis leaves or the inner epidermis of white onion peels were high pressure sprayed with the dna/gold solution _METHOD_ . sprayed leaves and onion peels were incubated for to h on agar plates with _METHOD_ medium containing m mannitol . _METHOD_ was detected with a confocal microscope _METHOD_ . peptide specific antisera against the c terminal peptide ceigsnkqwkegdtqss _PROTEIN_ were generated by pineda service . yeast cells _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in sense or antisense orientation were fixed embedded sectioned and treated with antisera as described . binding of anti _PROTEIN_ antibodies to yeast sections was visualized by treatment with anti rabbit igg fitc isomer conjugate . finally microscopic slides were mounted in antifading medium and viewed under appropriate excitation light . protein extracts of different _LOCATION_ fractions from bakers yeast were prepared as described separated on _PROTEIN_ polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose filters . _PROTEIN_ protein bands were detected by treatment of the filters with anti rabbit igg antiserum peroxidase conjugate followed by incubation with lumi light protein gel blotting substrate . full length and truncated _PROTEIN_ mrnas from wild type and t dna insertion plants were amplified with the primers _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . real time rt pcrs were performed on a rotorgene with the following primers _PROTEIN_ and for the actin standard _PROTEIN_ and for the ubiquitin standard _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ for _PROTEIN_ . images of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ were made with an _METHOD_ microscope or stereomicroscopes _METHOD_ with an excitation wavelength of to nm . emitted _METHOD_ was monitored at detection wavelengths longer than nm . confocal microscopy and staining with propidium iodide were performed as described .
