the cleavage of cis epoxycarotenoids to xanthoxin catalyzed by cis epoxycarotenoid dioxygenases is considered to be the key regulatory step of abscisic acid biosynthesis . in arabidopsis genes for these enzymes form a multigene family with nine members only five of which are thought to be involved in aba production . in contrast to the prominent function of _PROTEIN_ in stress responses the physiological and developmental role of the other cis epoxycarotenoid dioxygenases remain unknown . our functional and _PROTEIN_ analyses have revealed that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are required for aba biosynthesis during seed development . reverse genetic analysis showed that aba levels were reduced in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutant seeds . in addition transgenic plants overexpressing the _PROTEIN_ gene overproduced aba . in accordance with mutant phenotypes both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ exhibited seed specific _PROTEIN_ . detailed cytological studies were carried out either by using transcriptional fusions of the promoter with gus and _METHOD_ reporter genes or by in situ hybridization . _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ was observed exclusively in the endosperm during seed development that of _PROTEIN_ in both embryo and endosperm at mid development . in addition to reduced aba levels _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutant seeds were also resistant to paclobutrazol a gibberellin biosynthesis inhibitor . although seeds of single mutants were still dormant reduced dormancy was observed in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant seeds . these demonstrate that aba synthesized in both the endosperm and the embryo participates in the hormonal balance that controls seed dormancy and germination .
the in vivo involvement of nced proteins in aba biosynthesis has only been proven for _PROTEIN_ by functional analysis of mutants and transgenic plants . as _PROTEIN_ is among the five putative atnced enzymes the most distantly related to other family members and in particular to _PROTEIN_ we aimed to verify the involvement of _PROTEIN_ in aba biosynthesis in vivo by _PROTEIN_ this protein ectopically in transgenic plants . the overexpression of aba biosynthetic genes such as in tomato in nicotiana plumbaginifolia and _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis led to increased aba levels in leaves and seeds . it would therefore be predicted that the overexpression of the _PROTEIN_ gene under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus promoter would result in a similar effect . primary transformants carrying a _PROTEIN_ construct were selected for kanamycin resistance . progeny seeds of several lines showed reduced levels of germination . the number of germinated seeds could however be increased by addition of the aba biosynthesis inhibitor norflurazon or by stratification indicating that increased aba synthesis might be responsible for increased seed dormancy . to facilitate subsequent analyses we selected three independent transgenic lines segregating with a ratio for kanamycin resistance in seeds as predicted for a single t dna insertion which exhibited high levels of seed germination after stratification . _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ transgene was verified in the homozygous offspring of these three transgenic lines by northern analysis . in contrast to wild type leaves where no _PROTEIN_ transcripts were detected rna was present in transgenic leaves . accumulation of aba was then measured in non stressed rosettes of the three lines and an increase of up to fourfold was observed in comparison with wt levels . unexpectedly when detached rosettes were dehydrated to reduce the relative water content to of that of non stressed rosettes the increase in aba content was lower for transgenic lines than for wt . therefore increased aba synthesis apparently downregulated aba accumulation upon stress possibly through enhanced catabolism as proposed for n. plumbaginifolia nced overexpressers by citation . furthermore higher aba levels in turgid tissues increased their tolerance to subsequent desiccation . firstly the time required to reduce the water content of transgenic rosettes from to was longer than that for the wt . in addition analysis of the dehydration rate confirmed that transgenic plants were more resistant than wt to water loss . after h dehydration wild type detached rosettes had lost of their water content whereas transgenic lines had lost only . these results prove that the _PROTEIN_ gene is implicated in aba biosynthesis in vivo . in addition the results demonstrate that ectopic _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in vegetative tissues results in increased tolerance to hydric stress as shown previously for _PROTEIN_ . furthermore increased aba levels in transgenic lines also induced alterations in their vegetative development . rosette size was reduced and the floral _PROTEIN_ appeared _PROTEIN_ than in wt . therefore increased aba synthesis in non stressed plants reduced growth and delayed flowering time . retardation of plant development might result from both the inhibition of growth by high levels of aba and the induction of stomatal closure which would reduce photosynthetic activity . previous studies indicated that transcripts of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ could be detected by rt pcr in developing siliques and that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ could be detected in developing seeds by reporter gene analysis . to determine the precise localization of atnced gene _PROTEIN_ in siliques and seeds in comparison with other known aba biosynthesis genes rt pcr analysis was performed on dissected siliques and seeds at days after pollination . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were _PROTEIN_ in both empty silique envelopes and seeds . in contrast _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ was detected only in seed tissues . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was very low in all tissues at this stage . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ transcripts were among the five nceds the most abundant in seeds at mid maturation . furthermore they exhibited different tissue specific _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ transcript being detected almost exclusively in the tissue fraction containing testa and endosperm and _PROTEIN_ in both embryo and testa plus endosperm fractions . as the aba accumulated during seed development has been shown to derive from both maternal and embryonic tissues it was possible that tissue specific aba synthesis might be regulated by the differential _PROTEIN_ of the atnced family members . as shown here and also according to previous data several atnced genes showed distinct _PROTEIN_ patterns in seeds however the precise site of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was not reported . therefore we investigated the tissue specific localization of these transcripts by reporter gene analysis and/or in situ hybridization . to determine _PROTEIN_ spatial and temporal _PROTEIN_ patterns more precisely the gene promoter was fused to two different reporter genes gus and _METHOD_ . the results presented here were obtained with four independent transgenic lines for each construct all of which presented the same _PROTEIN_ profiles . before fertilization _PROTEIN_ transcripts were present in pollen and at the micropylar pole of ovules as revealed by gus activity . after fertilization _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was detected specifically by _METHOD_ analysis of intact seeds and by gus staining of seed cross sections . by these techniques we observed that _PROTEIN_ transcripts were present from fertilization up to seed maturity but no reporter gene _PROTEIN_ was detected at _PROTEIN_ maturation stages or in dry or imbibed seeds . at early stages after fertilization _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was observed uniformly throughout the embryo sac . fertilization of wt ovules with transgenic pollen showed that reporter gene _PROTEIN_ was already detected h after pollination indicating that _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ very early in fertilized cells and did not result simply from residual _PROTEIN_ in synergid or antipodal cells which had persisted in the embryo sac . during the early stages _LOCATION_ of the syncytial endosperm are first equally spaced in the embryo sac then a central _LOCATION_ is formed and the syncytium fills the _PROTEIN_ and micropylar chambers but is restricted to a single layer of _LOCATION_ in the central chamber surrounding the central _LOCATION_ . at the _PROTEIN_ globular stage _METHOD_ remained high in the micropylar endosperm localized around the embryo and also at the _PROTEIN_ pole but became weaker in the central endosperm layer . the lower _METHOD_ signal in this layer might result from localization of the _METHOD_ protein around the widely spaced _LOCATION_ that are surrounded by _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ as described by citation . at the heart stage cellularization of the endosperm begins in the micropylar chamber and then proceeds through the central chamber to the _PROTEIN_ chamber . at this point from heart to curled cotyledon stage embryo the _METHOD_ signal became lower around the embryo but remained strong at the _PROTEIN_ pole . a high _METHOD_ intensity in the _PROTEIN_ chamber might correlate with the persistence of a large coenocytic cyst of multinucleate cytoplasm . at all these stages no _METHOD_ was detected in the embryo or seed testa . therefore _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was apparently limited to the endosperm and its _PROTEIN_ pattern correlated with endosperm development . localization of _PROTEIN_ gene _PROTEIN_ in the endosperm was then confirmed by the observation of seed sections after gus staining or in situ hybridization . in day old seeds gus staining was clearly visible in the endosperm at the _PROTEIN_ and micropylar poles but also in the cellularized cell layer surrounding the embryo . in situ hybridization using seeds at the same stage also showed that transcripts were detected in these tissues . together these observations confirmed that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was tightly restricted to the endosperm in accordance with the data obtained by rt pcr . a kb _PROTEIN_ gene promoter was fused transcriptionally to the two reporter genes in order to determine the tissue specificity of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . however neither gus nor _METHOD_ could be detected in transgenic plants . in a previous study citation were unable to detect reporter gene _PROTEIN_ using a kb promoter fragment fused to the gus gene . we have shown here that extending the promoter fragment at the end did not restore promoter functionality . therefore we can hypothesize that an important regulatory sequence is missing which could reside after the start codon . we also performed in situ hybridization using an _PROTEIN_ specific probe of day old seed cross sections . as presented in figure _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ in the peripheral cell layers of the embryo as well as in the endosperm . these data confirmed those obtained by rt pcr . in order to investigate the contribution of both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ genes to aba biosynthesis during seed development the effects of mutations in both genes were analysed . two independent insertion mutants in _PROTEIN_ were identified in the databases of mutant collections used for systematic sequencing of insertion flanking sequences . the first _PROTEIN_ was in the sainsbury laboratory arabidopsis thaliana transposants collection generated by dspm element insertions in the col accession . the second _PROTEIN_ was a versailles collection t dna mutant in the ws accession . genomic dna was extracted either from individual plants from a seed pool containing _PROTEIN_ or from _PROTEIN_ plants and mutants were identified by pcr amplification from the dspm or left border extremity respectively . the location of the insertions was then characterized on homozygous mutants . similarly two independent insertion mutants _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in col accession were found among the salk t dna insertion lines and obtained from the nottingham arabidopsis stock centre seed bank . these two mutants were characterized as described for _PROTEIN_ mutants . abscisic acid plays a major role in drought stress responses and is involved in stomatal closure . however _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ exhibited respectively no or very low _PROTEIN_ levels in vegetative tissues therefore they are not expected to play a major role in water stress tolerance . nevertheless to verify gene function _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants were tested for their resistance to rapid dehydration . we observed that dehydration rates and the increase in aba levels observed in detached rosettes upon desiccation stress were similar to those of their respective wt . the absence of vegetative phenotypes in the _PROTEIN_ mutants correlates well with the observed tissue specific _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ transcripts . although detailed information is not available for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ very low transcript levels were detected in vegetative tissues by both rt pcr and northern analysis and these increased slightly upon water stress . nonetheless the absence of vegetative phenotypes in the mutants confirmed that the _PROTEIN_ gene does not play a major role in aba synthesis and stress tolerance upon rapid dehydration . in contrast to vegetative tissues _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ transcripts were abundant in seed tissues . levels of aba were measured in dry mutant seeds . the aba content was shown to be reduced to about half that of wt in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ indicating that aba synthesis in the endosperm makes a significant contribution to the amount of aba in dry seeds . for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants aba levels were and lower respectively than in wt seeds . most aba deficient mutants exhibit reduced seed dormancy and genetic studies have demonstrated that embryonic aba not maternal aba is responsible for induction of dormancy . the availability of aba deficient mutants that were specifically affected in aba synthesis in the different seed tissues allowed the respective roles of aba synthesized in the endosperm and in the embryo to be evaluated . freshly harvested seeds of the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants germinated at a rate similar to wt seeds indicating that dormancy was correctly established in contrast to a classic aba deficient mutant such as _PROTEIN_ . lack of seed dormancy in aba deficient mutants has also been described as being associated with increased resistance to paclobutrazol an inhibitor of gibberellin synthesis . when sown on a medium supplemented with paclobutrazol _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ seeds were clearly more resistant than wt . this indicated that fewer gas were required for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ germination as has been observed previously for aba deficient mutants affected in the step encoded by a single gene . interestingly the _PROTEIN_ mutant was more resistant to paclobutrazol compared with the _PROTEIN_ mutant . these observations suggest that the reduction of aba levels in either _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ seeds is not sufficient to reduce seed dormancy and that both endosperm and embryo derived aba affect the level of ga required for germination . cross fertilization between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants was performed giving rise to the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant . plants homozygous for the two insertions were selected by pcr amplification and the progeny of two double mutant lines issued from fertilization of two independent plants for each genotype were studied further and gave identical results . paclobutrazol resistance of double mutant seeds was enhanced compared with _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ single mutants as seeds exhibited a level of resistance similar to that of _PROTEIN_ . moreover dormancy was notably reduced in the double mutant seeds although germination rates of double mutant seeds were intermediate between those of wt and _PROTEIN_ . the observed heterogeneity of germination for double mutant seeds may be due to their reduced level of dormancy being affected to different degrees by variations in physiological and environmental _PROTEIN_ during seed development on the mother plant . in accordance with the reduction in seed dormancy and increased paclobutrazol resistance aba levels in double mutant dry seeds were lower although only about half that of wt in three independent experiments and the maximal reduction compared with _PROTEIN_ seeds was only . therefore other atnced genes probably contribute to aba synthesis for the induction of seed dormancy .
