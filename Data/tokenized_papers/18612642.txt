the arabidopsis genome has six families of dynamin related proteins . one of these families includes _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . the domain structures of proteins of this family are most similar to those of the animal endocytosis protein dynamin . in this study the signals of _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ were strongly detected in the cell plate of arabidopsis root tip cells and tobacco cultured cells . time lapse observations of these signals during cytokinesis in tobacco cultured cells suggested that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ localized to the newly formed part of the cell plate and that the localization dynamics of _PROTEIN_ was quite similar to that of _PROTEIN_ which is an arabidopsis dynamin related protein that is closely related to soybean phragmoplastin . these results indicate that arabidopsis dynamin related proteins _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ from two different families participate in _LOCATION_ remodeling at a similar place in the cell plate .
to investigate _PROTEIN_ localization we observed _METHOD_ fusions of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ which was under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus promoter in arabidopsis root tip cells and by cells . the endomembrane compartments where _PROTEIN_ was expected to localize including the cell plate were visualized with a styryl dye . has been used in many plant studies as an in vivo endocytic marker . in arabidopsis root tip cells _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ signals were detected in the _LOCATION_ in a dot like pattern and some of them co localized with the signals . in dividing cells these signals were strongly detected in the cell plate stained with . in dividing tobacco by cells _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ signals were also detected in the cell plate . much weaker _METHOD_ signals were also detected in the _LOCATION_ . these results suggest that _METHOD_ labeled _PROTEIN_ strongly localizes to the cell plate . in tobacco by cells immediately before cytokinesis weak and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ signals were detected in the _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ around the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and around _LOCATION_ . at the beginning of cytokinesis and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ signals were detected over the _LOCATION_ . in the early stage of cell plate formation cell plates stained with and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ signals emerged in the center of the division plane and subsequently expanded to the outer cell cortex . in the early stage of cell plate formation the and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ signals almost corresponded with each other . however at the _PROTEIN_ stages the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ signals _PROTEIN_ localized to the leading edge of the cell plate and disappeared from the central region where cell plate formation was thought to be completed . these results indicate that _PROTEIN_ localized dynamically to the newly synthesized parts of the cell plate . in the early stage of cell plate formation signals accumulated in the division plane . _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ signals started to localize to the division plane shortly after the signals appeared . this result suggests that accumulation of _PROTEIN_ to the division plane occurred shortly after the _LOCATION_ stained with in the early stage of cell plate formation . to compare the localization dynamics of during cell plate formation to that of family protein we observed the _METHOD_ fusions of _PROTEIN_ and monomeric _METHOD_ _METHOD_ fusions of _PROTEIN_ during cell plate formation in the same living by cell . in tobacco by cell plate formation _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ signals were localized to the newly synthesized part . _METHOD_ fusions of _PROTEIN_ signals were also localized to the newly synthesized part . the _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ signals were well co localized temporally and spatially in the forming cell plate throughout the course of cytokinesis . this result suggests that the localization dynamics of _PROTEIN_ is quite similar to that of _PROTEIN_ .
arabidopsis and its transformant were grown under under diurnal h light . bright yellow tobacco cell suspension cultures were grown in modified murashige and skoog medium enriched with mg d and were _PROTEIN_ as described in previous study . three day old by cells were used in the microscopic observations . we obtained an est clone of _PROTEIN_ from kazusa dna research institute and a cdna clone of _PROTEIN_ from the arabidopsis biological resource center . plasmids harboring _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were constructed using gateway cloning technology . the open reading frames of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were amplified from the est clone and full length cdna clone by pcr using the following primer sets respectively _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . the underlined sequences are needed for subcloning the pcr product into the gateway donor vector via _PROTEIN_ recombinant reaction . the resulting entry vectors were used in lr reactions with the destination binary vector and to link _METHOD_ and monomeric _METHOD_ to the n termini of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ respectively . ti plasmids harboring _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ were transformed into agrobacterium tumefaciens strain . the transformation of arabidopsis plants was performed by using transformed a. tumefaciens via floral dipping . transgenic plants were selected on plates containing solid modified _METHOD_ medium containing sucrose and mg kanamycin . ti plasmids harboring _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and monomeric _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ were individually transformed into a. tumefaciens strain . a ml aliquot of day old by cells was incubated with of the overnight culture of the a. tumefaciens with ti plasmids harboring _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ as the method described previously . after h incubation at cells were washed four times in ml of modified _METHOD_ medium then plated onto solid modified _METHOD_ medium containing mg claforan and mg kanamycin . after weeks selected calli were transferred onto new plates and cultured for weeks additionally . as each callus reached a size of cm in diameter it was transferred to ml of new modified _METHOD_ medium with mg claforan and mg kanamycin and cultured in a rotary shaker at rpm at in the dark . after weeks we selected suitable cell lines _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ at the appropriate level for _METHOD_ microscopic observation . transgenic by cells _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and monomeric _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ were established by introducing the _PROTEIN_ of monomeric _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ into the cell line _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ as the method described above with the a. tumefaciens with ti plasmids harboring monomeric _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . transformants were selected on plates containing solid modified _METHOD_ medium containing mg claforan mg kanamycin and mg hygromycin . dissolved in water was applied at a final concentration for min to arabidopsis plants or by cells . these arabidopsis plants and by cells were washed with modified _METHOD_ medium to remove excess dye and used in microscopic observations . transgenic arabidopsis root and by cells _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion proteins were subjected to vital imaging by using a _METHOD_ microscope and a confocal laser scanning microscopic _PROTEIN_ system . arabidopsis root stained with were placed on glass slides without any treatment . during microscopic observation by cells stained with were cultured in mm glass bottom dishes at in the stage top incubator . the samples were illuminated with an argon ion laser for _METHOD_ and a green hene laser for and monomeric _METHOD_ . to eliminate the crosstalk of the _METHOD_ and monomeric _METHOD_ signals these two _METHOD_ molecules were sequentially excited by and nm laser and also detected sequentially . all _PROTEIN_ images were acquired in a single focal plane . acquired images were prepared and analyzed with photoshop _METHOD_ and image pro plus .
