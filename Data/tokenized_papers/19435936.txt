here we identify the arabidopsis thaliana ortholog of the mammalian dead box helicase iii the putative anchor protein of exon junction complex on mrna . arabidopsis iii interacts with an ortholog of the core ejc component aly/ref and colocalizes with other ejc components such as _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ suggesting a similar function in ejc assembly to animal iii . a green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ iii fusion protein showed localization to several subnuclear domains to the nucleoplasm during normal growth and to the nucleolus and splicing speckles in response to hypoxia . treatment with the respiratory inhibitor sodium azide produced an identical response to the hypoxia stress . treatment with the proteasome inhibitor led to accumulation of _METHOD_ iii _PROTEIN_ in the nucleolus suggesting that transition of iii between subnuclear domains and/or accumulation in _LOCATION_ speckles is controlled by proteolysis labile _PROTEIN_ . as revealed by _METHOD_ recovery after photobleaching analysis the nucleoplasmic fraction was highly mobile while the speckles were the least mobile fractions and the nucleolar fraction had an intermediate mobility . sequestration of iii into _LOCATION_ pools with different mobility is likely to reflect the transcriptional and mrna processing state of the cell .
following its detection in a proteomic analysis of arabidopsis nucleoli we identified the arabidopsis iii gene by a reciprocal blast search as the sequence with the highest similarity to the human iii gene . dead box helicases are a protein family characterized by the conserved motif asp glu ala asp . arabidopsis iii was also very similar to an ortholog previously identified in tobacco . a multiple alignment of eukaryotic iii sequences reveals highly conserved regions and motifs . arabidopsis iii has a desd motif instead of dead as present in animals . all of the conserved motifs of the dead box protein family are present in the arabidopsis iii protein such as the _PROTEIN_ binding region i motif ii involved in _PROTEIN_ hydrolysis and coupling _PROTEIN_ hydrolysis to helicase activity and motif iii critical for rna unwinding . motif vi is unique to rna helicases and is involved in the _PROTEIN_ hydrolysis dependent rna binding of iii . the multiple alignment indicated that the c terminal domain is the most conserved part of this protein . this region contains the residues involved in rna binding and interaction with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and the selor domain of in the human ejc . these residues are among the most conserved residues across different species suggesting that iii _METHOD_ a core unit of the ejc complex in arabidopsis in a manner similar to the characterized structure of mammalian ejc . to examine whether arabidopsis iii interacts with ejc core proteins and other ejc components we screened the interactions of several known orthologs of ejc components in arabidopsis including iii and two other rna helicases translation initiation _PROTEIN_ i and ii using a yeast two hybrid assay . as expected the strongest reciprocal interaction was observed for proteins _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ as previously shown for animal ejc proteins and in arabidopsis . a number of weak interactions were also observed including iii interactions with ejc core proteins _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . however these weak interactions were inconclusive since they were observed only with iii in the pbkt construct . iii in the pgadt activation domain construct showed detectable activation with the empty pbkt . to further examine these interactions we undertook a series of pull down experiments . recombinant maltose binding protein iii _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ selor _METHOD_ of and _PROTEIN_ proteins were _PROTEIN_ in escherichia coli and purified on ni columns . their interaction was tested in vitro using amylose beads to pull down proteins interacting with mbp iii either pairwise or in complex mixture of all recombinant proteins . a positive interaction was observed between mbp iii and _PROTEIN_ both in pairwise and complex reactions . to examine the subcellular localization of iii a translational _METHOD_ fusion _METHOD_ was constructed and _PROTEIN_ transiently in arabidopsis columbia culture cells . _METHOD_ iii was found to localize _PROTEIN_ in the _LOCATION_ with a small amount of the protein found in the cytoplasm . _LOCATION_ labeling patterns in different cells varied from a diffuse signal in the nucleoplasm to concentrated labeling of the nucleolus and speckles . dual localization of _METHOD_ iii with several _LOCATION_ red _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ fusion marker proteins allowed the identification of the subnuclear compartments . fibrillarin _METHOD_ colocalized with _METHOD_ iii in the nucleolus . colocalization of _METHOD_ iii with _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and the _PROTEIN_ protein _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ also called _PROTEIN_ by citation and citation confirmed its localization in splicing speckles . splicing speckles are known to be sites for processing storage and/or recycling of splicing _PROTEIN_ . finally _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ a marker for cajal bodies which are often associated with the nucleolus did not appear to colocalize with _METHOD_ iii . to confirm the identification of _GENE_ as the arabidopsis ortholog of mammalian iii we performed colocalization studies with two well known components of the ejc core complex _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . complete colocalization in both the nucleolus and speckles was observed for _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and iii _METHOD_ while _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ colocalized with iii _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in the nucleolus and partially in speckles . the different subnuclear localization patterns observed suggest that iii localization changes under different conditions . to examine the dynamics of iii localization we used both transient _PROTEIN_ in col cell cultures and stable transgenic plant lines _PROTEIN_ the _METHOD_ iii fusion protein . when arabidopsis col cells transiently transformed by _METHOD_ iii were imaged within to min of taking a sample from culture grown in optimal conditions the majority of observed cells displayed diffuse _METHOD_ throughout the nucleoplasm often with less intensity of signal in the nucleolus . hypoxic conditions induced by placing culture cells on a microscope slide covered by a cover slip resulted in the relocation and accumulation of the _METHOD_ signal into nucleoli and _LOCATION_ speckles usually after to min with significant fading of the signal in the nucleoplasm . detailed examination of the dynamics showed that _METHOD_ iii accumulated first in the nucleolus immediately followed by the appearance of speckles usually at the periphery of the nucleolus . the prevalence of nucleoplasmic labeling correlated with optimal grown conditions of the culture cells continuous shaking at to rpm in flasks or multiwell plates permitting air permeation and an adequate supply of oxygen and temperatures not higher than . to follow the dynamic relocalization of _METHOD_ iii in more controlled conditions culture cells were placed in a gas permeable microscopy chamber in a small volume . under these conditions the transition from nucleoplasmic to speckle labeling occurred in a very synchronous manner over a much longer time period . the transition of the _METHOD_ iii from diffuse nucleoplasmic labeling into nucleoli was observed by min after transfer to the chamber and into speckles in to min . these results clearly demonstrate the pathway of transport of iii from nucleoplasm to nucleolus and finally splicing speckles . in addition this transport pathway was shown to be reversible as closing the gate and thus restricting gas exchange caused speckles to appear and reopening the gate led to recovery of nucleoplasmic pattern within min . in arabidopsis plants stably _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ iii a very similar response to hypoxia was observed . a primary root placed in a gas permeable chamber with adequate aeration continued to grow and the majority of epidermal and cortical cells displayed a diffuse _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ signal . when the root was placed in the chamber with no air supply depletion of oxygen soon caused the transition from diffuse nucleoplasmic labeling to accumulation in splicing speckles . this was observed in root cells near the root tip and in the elongation zone of plants _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ iii . often differential sensitivity to stress could be observed between epidermal cortical and stele root cells as seen by some heterogeneity of labeling . again the change of localization of iii from nucleoplasmic labeling to accumulation in speckles was reversible . treatment by the respiratory inhibitor sodium azide had the same effect as hypoxia resulting in rapid relocation of _METHOD_ iii into nucleolus and speckles in seedlings consistent with the mode of action through the same mechanism of inhibition of respiration . in control cells iii showed nucleoplasmic labeling that became distributed between nucleoli and speckles at low concentration of sodium azide whereas a higher concentration of the inhibitor caused predominant accumulation of the protein in the nucleolus . as iii is a spliceosomal component and part of the postsplicing ejc we asked whether the redistribution of _METHOD_ iii with azide treatment correlated with a defect in spicing . to test this we used an rt pcr splicing system used to measure alternative splicing changes to examine the splicing of genes that showed evidence of intron retention where an intron is not removed from the transcript . the intron retention events were obtained from plant alternative splicing databases and the intron retention transcript was detectable with the rt pcr system . we reasoned that if there is a general reduction in splicing the relative levels of transcripts with unspliced introns would increase . rt pcr was performed on total rna prepared from three biological reps of seedlings treated with azide as above and checked for subcellular localization of _METHOD_ iii . following an rt reaction with oligo the cdna was aliquoted and pcr reactions with gene specific primers were performed . primers were designed to detect all alternatively spliced transcripts in a region and to amplify across more than one intron to distinguish transcripts with an unspliced intron from any signal due to dna contamination . pcr was performed for cycles . the ratio of the amount of fully spliced product to total products was calculated . of the loci tested for increases in intron retention showed no effect on splicing four showed a small increase in the relative amount of intron retention transcript compared with fully spliced and one showed a _PROTEIN_ . thus most splicing was unaffected by the treatment such that there was no clear defect that could be associated with the redistribution of _METHOD_ iii to speckles or the nucleolus . under conditions of low oxygen _METHOD_ iii moved from the nucleoplasm to the nucleolus and then splicing speckles . we quantified this behavior and determined whether other stress conditions or specific inhibitors in culture cells could induce changes in localization . for this purpose localization of _METHOD_ iii was scored as nucleoplasmic nucleolar nucleolar and speckles and speckles . compared with the predominantly diffuse staining of nucleoplasm in control cells the most dramatic and rapid relocation of the _METHOD_ iii to the nucleolus and splicing speckles was observed in cells under hypoxia . interestingly treatment with the proteasome inhibitor caused a very specific nucleolar accumulation of _METHOD_ iii for of cells . thus blocking the proteosome caused the accumulation of arabidopsis iii at the intermediate nucleolar stage in the transport pathway indicating either that the release of this protein/complex from the nucleolus to the nucleoplasm and/or its accumulation in the splicing speckles requires a proteolysis step or that inhibition of proteolysis enhances a nucleolar sequestration mechanism . distribution of localization patterns of iii observed in cells treated with or hypoxia compared with control cells to see whether the properties of arabidopsis iii differed among the different regions of the _LOCATION_ we analyzed the mobility of the three different pools of _METHOD_ iii using _METHOD_ recovery after photobleaching . this was performed in both arabidopsis col culture cells transiently _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ iii and in stably transformed arabidopsis plants . a background _METHOD_ image was recorded followed by photobleaching to significantly reduce the _METHOD_ intensity in a small circle with a diameter of and the rate of _METHOD_ recovery was measured as unbleached molecules diffused into the bleached area . typical frap experiments performed on nucleoplasmic nucleolar and speckle fractions are shown in supplemental movies to online . average values of background normalized recovery data for nucleoplasm nucleolus and speckles from independent experiments for each subnuclear compartment in suspension culture cells clearly demonstrated different recovery rates for the three regions . in general all fractions had recovered to stable values of > of the initial _METHOD_ values within s. recovery of the nucleoplasmic fraction was the fastest with a half time of s the splicing speckles required longest times for recovery with a half time of s and the nucleolar fraction had an intermediate rate of recovery with a half time of s. therefore the nucleoplasmic fraction represents the most mobile form of _METHOD_ iii the speckles represent the least mobile fraction and the nucleolar fraction has a mobility that is slightly lower than the nucleoplasm but still higher than speckles . the maximal level of recovery as indicated by coefficient a in table was observed for the nucleoplasmic fraction with a similar level for nucleolar and a slightly lower value for speckles . frap parameters estimated for different _LOCATION_ fractions of _METHOD_ iii using curve fitting software the frap data obtained on hypocotyls and root cells of arabidopsis plants also demonstrated consistent differences in mobility between nucleoplasmic and speckle fractions . the half time of _METHOD_ recovery in nucleoplasmic fractions in arabidopsis plants was very similar to the values from the suspension cells with s in hypocotyls and s root cells of control plants . as in culture cells speckles were formed under hypoxic conditions and the mobility of the _METHOD_ iii after sequestration to speckles significantly _PROTEIN_ . _METHOD_ recovery in the speckles of hypoxia stressed plants was much slower than in the nucleoplasm with half times of and s in hypocotyls and roots respectively . compared with the culture cells many fewer _LOCATION_ with nucleolar concentration of labeling were observed in plant roots stressed with hypoxia thus we did not perform frap analysis on this compartment in plants . overall in both cell culture and whole plants the half time of recovery was several times longer for splicing speckles compared with the nucleoplasmic fraction of _METHOD_ iii .
multiple sequence alignment of homo sapiens mus musculus drosophila melanogaster caenorabditis elegans danio rerio and arabidopsis thaliana proteins was performed using clustalx program and reformatting the output data using _PROTEIN_ in a format that highlights only the different nucleotides/residues relative to the first query sequence . a full length orf of iii was pcr amplified from the cdna library and inserted into vector . the _METHOD_ fusion construct was made using gateway recombinational cloning into _METHOD_ n bin _PROTEIN_ vector as previously described . orfs of known marker proteins _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were pcr amplified from cdna and cloned into vector the orf of was amplified from _METHOD_ plasmid and _PROTEIN_ was as described by citation and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ as described by citation . construction of _METHOD_ fusions of marker proteins was performed using lr reaction for recombination between clones containing appropriate orfs and a gateway compatible vector _METHOD_ which contains coding sequence of monomeric _METHOD_ at the c terminal end of the attr cassette . the constructs were transiently _PROTEIN_ in col arabidopsis cell culture as previously described . briefly col suspension culture was diluted with fresh _PROTEIN_ media _METHOD_ ph and transformed by coculture with agrobacterium tumefaciens carrying _PROTEIN_ vector for to d in the dark conditions at with shaking and good aeration . arabidopsis plants were transformed by the floral dip method and seedlings selected on petri plates with _METHOD_ agar media containing kanamycin . kanamycin resistant seedlings _PROTEIN_ a moderate level of _METHOD_ iii were further selected using _METHOD_ microscopy . the seedlings were grown vertical on _METHOD_ agar plates in a growth room under constant light at . the localization patterns were consistent between several lines in and generations . full length orfs of the components of the arabidopsis ejc in were used in recombination reactions to transfer genes to pdest _PROTEIN_ and pdest vectors . _PROTEIN_ products were transformed into s. cerevisiae strain and products into strain . after pairwise mating of strains _PROTEIN_ the ejc constructs colonies were grown on media depleted of leu trp his and adenine or on media depleted of leu and trp containing x galactose . yeast strains transformed by empty vectors and were used as negative controls and t antigen with as a positive control . orfs of iii _PROTEIN_ the selor domain of and _PROTEIN_ were amplified with pcr primers digested by sfii and cloned into ptriex sfii vectors for translational fusion to mbp or _METHOD_ all vectors also contained the tag . recombinant proteins were _PROTEIN_ in escherichia coli and purified on his trap ni sepharose columns . their interaction was tested in vitro either pairwise or in complex mixture of all recombinant proteins . protein mixtures containing mbp iii were incubated in ml of binding buffer for h at and gentle rotation then of amylose beads were added followed by additional incubation for h. the amylose beads were washed three times with binding buffer and bound proteins eluted with _PROTEIN_ sample buffer . eluted proteins were separated on _PROTEIN_ polyacrylamide gels and used for protein gel blotting with anti his hrp antibodies . pull down experiments were repeated twice . col cells in exponential phase of the culture transiently _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ iii with a selected marker protein _METHOD_ fusion were imaged using leica sp and laser scanning microscopes with a oil immersion objective . the _METHOD_ images of cells _PROTEIN_ both reporters were taken at pixels resolution using combinational excitation of of laser power at nm and of laser power at nm and detection windows of to and to nm for _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ channels respectively . images of averaged intensity of three to four scans were collected . arabidopsis cells either col culture or roots of plants transformed with _METHOD_ iii were imaged using either a leica _PROTEIN_ or confocal microscope _METHOD_ . _METHOD_ was excited using nm light from an argon ion laser and imaged using emission filters to nm . at each time point a z stack of images was collected and the images from z sections were projected using the maximum intensity projection algorithm in either the leica software or imagej program . time lapse imaging of living cells was acquired at to min intervals in a gas permeable biochamber . the biochamber was constructed from a standard cover slip as the top of the chamber . a well was made in secure seal and attached to the cover slip . the plant was placed in the well with liquid _METHOD_ media and a gas permeable _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ was attached to the secure seal as the bottom of the chamber . the chamber was then mounted on a support slide to allow normal attachment to any microscope an mm diameter hole was cut in this support slide to allow free gaseous exchange through the gas permeable _LOCATION_ . for the reversible hypoxia experiment the biochamber was modified to allow gating of the _LOCATION_ . each end of the biochamber was raised by two cover slips before being attached to the support slide . a third cover slip mm was positioned between the two cover slips so that it could slide over the hole like shutting a gate . this gating cover slip is not sufficient to block gaseous exchange by itself water had to be added between the _LOCATION_ and the gating cover slip to block gaseous exchange . water was used instead of oil to allow the process to be reversed . seedlings or cells were then placed into the chamber and covered with a gas permeable _LOCATION_ . the chamber with the gas permeable _LOCATION_ facing down was then placed over a cm hole drilled into a plastic support slide and the edges of the sandwich sealed with tape . plants and cells were imaged using a zeiss meta confocal microscope using a objective . _METHOD_ was exciting using the nm laser line from an argon ion laser and the emission was captured using a to nm band pass filter . cells were imaged in at multiple locations in both hypocotyl and root . they were left on the slide to induce hypoxia and reimaged min _PROTEIN_ when speckled patterns had formed . after that the hypoxia stress was relieved by removing the plants from the slide and allowing them to recover in _METHOD_ media for h and then reimaged . arabidopsis culture cells were embedded in agarose and placed into the modified gas permeable biochamber where the gas permeable _LOCATION_ could be blocked to induce hypoxia or exposed to air . cells were imaged in at multiple locations under nonstressed conditions . the _LOCATION_ was then blocked to induce hypoxia stress and the stressed cells were then reimaged after min . to relieve the hypoxia stress the _LOCATION_ was then allowed to breathe again allowing the cells to recover and reimaged after min . frap experiments were performed using a leica laser scanning confocal microscope _METHOD_ equipped with a mw argon ion laser . the leica microlab frap module was used in flymode to bleach an x line in one direction and then acquire data in the revere direction of the scan to minimize the time delay between the bleach and the first post image . the kinetics of _METHOD_ iii was studied in both col cells and arabidopsis seedlings . col cells in exponential phase of the culture transiently _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ iii were placed in a gas permeable chamber or on a standard microscope slide . cells were observed using a oil immersion objective zoom pixels hz and imaged using of the nm line from an argon ion laser running at power emission was captured from a to nm window with an open detector pinhole . ten data points were acquired within to s to measure prebleaching intensity in a selected area . a small circular area was photobleached using of and nm lines from the argon ion laser with five iterations . the bleaching scan lasted s and was immediately followed by imaging scans at the line level with only a few milliseconds delay . images were taken at _METHOD_ intervals for s when the maximal recovery of the signal was observed . arabidopsis seedlings to d old stably _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ iii were placed in a gas permeable chamber or on a standard microscope slide . seedlings were observed using a oil immersion objective zoom pixels hz and imaged using of the nm line from an argon ion laser running at power emission was captured from the to nm window with an open detector pinhole . twenty data points were acquired within to s to measure prebleaching intensity in a selected area . a small circular area was photobleached using of and nm lines from the argon ion laser with two iterations . the bleaching scan lasted s and was immediately followed by imaging scans at the line level with only a few milliseconds delay . images were taken at _METHOD_ intervals for s when the maximal recovery of the signal was observed . the intensities of the signal were background normalized to produce relative _METHOD_ intensity data . average values of relative _METHOD_ intensity recovery from independent frap experiments for each subnuclear compartment were used for quantitative data analysis of _METHOD_ iii kinetics in nucleoplasm nucleolus and speckles . formal kinetic parameters of recovery were estimated using curve fitting software tablecurve . average background normalized recovery data for nucleoplasm nucleolus and speckles from independent experiments for each subnuclear compartment were fitted into exponential model curves using an equation of one phase exponential formation/ association y a where a is the final level of signal recovery t is time in seconds and b is the rate of recovery constant . half time of _METHOD_ recovery was calculated as . the iii plants were treated with sodium azide for a minimum time of min before imaging . plants were visualized using a visitech voxcell spinning disc confocal microscope with oil immersion objective . _METHOD_ was excited using the nm laser line from an argon ion laser and its emission was collected through to nm band pass filter and detected on a hamamatsu orca _LOCATION_ cooled ccd camera . transiently transformed cells in the exponential phase were diluted by fresh _PROTEIN_ media for col cells dispensed as ml aliquots in six well plates and proteasome inhibitor was added for a final concentration of . the plates were sealed by air permeable micropore tape and placed in the dark shaker/incubator at and rpm . in a pilot experiment imaging was performed at h intervals to determine the time required for redistribution of the signal in response to a treatment . the redistribution was observed after h of incubation and remained stable for at least next h therefore a time interval to h of treatment was used for taking samples for imaging and cell counting . to avoid interference of the inhibitor assays with hypoxia cell counts were performed on each slide for not longer than min . _LOCATION_ were counted and their staining pattern assigned as nucleoplasmic nucleolus nucleolus plus speckles or speckles . the results were subjected to statistical analysis by comparing cell counts of localization types by a generalized linear model with a log link and poisson _LOCATION_ and estimating significance based on approximate f probabilities from appropriate deviance ratios . rna and rt pcr was as described previously . in summary total rna was extracted from to mg of ground azide treated tissue using the rneasy plant mini rna isolation kit followed by first strand cdna synthesis on of total rna using ready to go you prime first strand beads and oligo d according to the manufacturer 's instructions . the reverse transcription reaction was diluted to a final volume of and aliquoted into a well reaction plate along with pcr buffer mm datp dctp dgtp and dttp of each of the gene specific primers and taq dna polymerase . the pcr reaction was performed for cycles which we have previously shown to be in the linear amplification range for a number of different genes with different _PROTEIN_ levels . the gene specific primers amplify all transcripts in the particular region of the gene allowing their relative abundance to be measured . to identify transcripts with retained introns on the _PROTEIN_ the primers were designed across two to four introns and the forward primer was labeled with _PROTEIN_ to visualize the rt pcr products . one microliter of each rt pcr reaction was separated on a dna analyzer _METHOD_ and peak data collected and analyzed using genemapper software _METHOD_ . the relative peak areas of rt pcr products representing fully spliced transcripts transcripts with retained introns and other alternatively spliced transcripts if detected were extracted and the ratio of products calculated . for accurate measurement of intron retention in the azide treatments rna from three biological samples was used and mean as efficiencies with standard _LOCATION_ were calculated . sequence data from this article can be found in the arabidopsis
