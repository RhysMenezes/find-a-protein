two distinct peroxisomal targeting signals _PROTEIN_ the c terminal _PROTEIN_ and the n terminal _PROTEIN_ are defined . processing of the _PROTEIN_ on protein import is conserved in higher eukaryotes . recently candidates for the responsible processing protease were identified from plants _PROTEIN_ and mammals . we demonstrate that plants lacking _PROTEIN_ show an _PROTEIN_ phenotype potentially linked to reduced oxidation indicating the impact of protein processing on peroxisomal functions in higher eukaryotes . mutational analysis of arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ revealed that conserved histidine aspartic acid and serine residues are essential for the proteolytic activity of this enzyme in vitro . this indicates that _PROTEIN_ and related enzymes are trypsin like serine endopeptidases . deletion of a plant specific stretch present in the protease domain diminished but did not abolish the proteolytic activity of _PROTEIN_ against the _PROTEIN_ containing glyoxysomal malate dehydrogenase . _METHOD_ microscopy showed that a _PROTEIN_ green _METHOD_ protein fusion construct is targeted to _LOCATION_ in planta . in vivo studies with isolated homozygous _PROTEIN_ knockout mutants and complemented mutant lines suggest that this enzyme mediates general processing of _PROTEIN_ containing proteins .
to investigate the impact of _PROTEIN_ processing by _PROTEIN_ on the function of _LOCATION_ we analyzed wild type and _PROTEIN_ knockout plants for their ability to grow in the presence of the nontoxic herbicide precursor db . because db is converted to the toxic herbicide d by peroxisomal oxidation plants impaired in this function should stay unaffected during such treatment . a clear phenotypic difference was observed between the _PROTEIN_ knockout mutant and wild type plants treated with db . mutant plants had significantly longer roots than the wild type when grown on solid medium containing db . this phenotype was more pronounced with the increased seedling age and at higher concentrations of db and was reversed in _PROTEIN_ knockout plants complemented with constitutively _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . this _METHOD_ that the lack of _PROTEIN_ is responsible for resistance to db and not to a so far undetected second mutation in the _PROTEIN_ knockout line . no difference in root length was observed in wild type and mutant plants grown in the presence of d indicating that the increased resistance to db of the mutant line is not due to an altered response to auxin . we further tested the dependence of dark grown wild type and _PROTEIN_ seedlings on suc . no difference in hypocotyl lengths was observed between etiolated wild type and mutant seedlings . oilseed plants like arabidopsis metabolize storage fatty acids during seedling establishment by peroxisomal oxidation . if this pathway was impaired in _PROTEIN_ mutant plants they would depend on an external energy source such as sugar for normal germination . our result indicates that _PROTEIN_ mutant plants are able to metabolize enough fatty acids during seedling establishment in darkness to promote normal growth . it is possible that the lack of _PROTEIN_ processing does not reduce the efficiency of the enzymatic machinery involved in the oxidation of fatty acids and their subsequent conversion to energy . at least for one peroxisomal enzyme gmdh it was shown that there is no difference in the catalytic properties of processed and unprocessed enzymes . it is possible that the lack of protein processing specifically affects the oxidation of db to d. recently a protein specific for the oxidation of the naturally occurring db analog indole butyric acid was described from arabidopsis suggesting that an at least partially independent pathway for the oxidation of iba and db may exist in parallel to the oxidation of fatty acids . other mutant strains that show a response to db treatment but no sugar dependency for germination in darkness contain a mutated gene for the _PROTEIN_ receptor . this protein is a _PROTEIN_ recognition _PROTEIN_ and is involved in _PROTEIN_ dependent peroxisomal import . after translocation _PROTEIN_ is recycled back to the cytoplasm . it is tempting to speculate that the lack of _PROTEIN_ processing in _PROTEIN_ plants might interfere with the successful relocation of _PROTEIN_ recognition _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ to the cytoplasm because the machinery involved in this process is not yet well understood . the conserved putative catalytic triad of _PROTEIN_ from arabidopsis is located at positions his asp and ser in the amino acid sequence alignment as compared with degp of escherichia coli _PROTEIN_ of rice human and arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ proteases from plants contain an additional loop of approximately amino acids between the catalytic residues his and asp . in disagreement with the presence of a conserved putative catalytic triad typical for ser proteases the mammalian _PROTEIN_ homolog in function was identified as a cys protease . to test the involvement of conserved amino acids in the catalytic process the following residues of _PROTEIN_ were mutated to ala ser _PROTEIN_ ser _PROTEIN_ cys _PROTEIN_ ser _PROTEIN_ his _PROTEIN_ asp _PROTEIN_ cys _PROTEIN_ ser _PROTEIN_ ser _PROTEIN_ and ser _PROTEIN_ .arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ as well as the mutated versions was _PROTEIN_ in e. coli as recombinant fusion proteins with an n terminal tag . additionally _PROTEIN_ lacking the plant specific loop was _PROTEIN_ under similar conditions to examine the requirement of this region for the activity of plant _PROTEIN_ . several protein bands were visible after chromatographic purification of _PROTEIN_ and its mutated versions in _METHOD_ stained _PROTEIN_ polyacrylamide gels . for _PROTEIN_ all three major bands were recognized by an anti his tag antibody and identified by _METHOD_ _METHOD_ as full length _PROTEIN_ or its truncated versions lacking the protease domain . in the eluted fraction of _PROTEIN_ a band with the apparent molecular _METHOD_ of kd was missing indicating self cleavage of active _PROTEIN_ . this band also appeared in the eluted fractions of the other mutated active versions of _PROTEIN_ . the full length and truncated _PROTEIN_ spontaneously formed oligomers with different subunit combinations that could not be removed by standard chromatographic procedures . since pre gmdh is processed by _PROTEIN_ in vivo we used purified recombinant arabidopsis pre gmdh _PROTEIN_ with an n terminal tag in e. coli as substrate for recombinant _PROTEIN_ and its mutated versions in vitro . a mock assay was performed in the absence of added _PROTEIN_ as a negative control . _PROTEIN_ was processed upon incubation of full length his/xpressepitope tagged recombinant pre gmdh to an approximately kd smaller fragment as visualized by _METHOD_ stained _PROTEIN_ polyacrylamide gels . immunoblotting with anti his tag antibody confirmed that processing of recombinant pre gmdh occurs at the n terminus because the resulting large fragment of approximately kd no longer contained the his tag . the processed gmdh fragment was analyzed by n terminal edman sequencing indicating that cleavage in the in vitro assay occurs at the same site as in vivo _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ showed no proteolytic activity against pre gmdh . mutation of the residues ser and ser to ala did not alter the activity of the protease whereas the activity was reduced after mutation of ser and ser _PROTEIN_ . mutation of ser drastically reduced proteolytic activity of this construct and less substrate was degraded as compared to _PROTEIN_ . the deletion of the plant specific stretch led to reduced substrate processing _PROTEIN_ . interestingly the activity of recombinant _PROTEIN_ was slightly enhanced by the exchange of cys residues cys and cys to ala _PROTEIN_ . these data show that his asp and ser but neither the plant specific stretch nor any of the other investigated residues are essential for proteolytic activity of arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ . inhibition of by nem but not by both universal inhibitors of cys proteases led to the conclusion that represents a novel class among cys proteases therefore we tested the effect of various protease inhibitors on recombinant arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ using pre gmdh as a substrate . similar to the proteolytic activity of _PROTEIN_ in our protease assays was abolished by the cys protease inhibitor nem but not by . however one should mention here that nem is not a specific cys protease inhibitor but a broad acting agent that may be able to inhibit every enzyme containing free thiol groups due to its alkylation activity . lack of inhibition of arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ by general ser protease inhibitors such as benzamidine aprotinin leupeptin or pefabloc can be explained by the observation that some ser protease subclasses are resistant to the action of broad range inhibitors . for example the only known inhibitor for e. coli degp is diisopropylfluorophosphate . no inhibition of _PROTEIN_ was observed in the presence of pepstatin a an inhibitor of aspartyl proteases or metalloprotease inhibitors such as egta edta or phenanthroline . complexity of inhibitor studies is further supported by the _PROTEIN_ that _PROTEIN_ from watermelon was inhibited by general ser/cys protease inhibitors but not by the widely used ser protease inhibitor phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride _METHOD_ . enzymatic activity of recombinant arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ was only slightly reduced by _METHOD_ . because nem is a reagent for the covalent modification of cys residues the conclusion from the inhibitor studies is that either of or cys residues present in _PROTEIN_ or respectively is important for enzymatic activity . alternatively a covalent modification of a cys in the substrate may abolish cleavage . _PROTEIN_ from watermelon was reported to occur either as a monomer or as a dimer with the monomer acting as a general protease and the dimer as the peroxisomal processing protease . size exclusion chromatography of _PROTEIN_ showed two distinct peaks suggesting the presence of at least two oligomeric states formed by full length kd and truncated kd _PROTEIN_ . preliminary cross linking studies using glutaraldehyde revealed that and kd _PROTEIN_ formed and kd complexes that might represent mers to mers mers to mers and mers respectively depending on the stoichiometry of the full length and truncated _METHOD_ . because we were not able to separate both _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ it is not possible to precisely identify the oligomeric state of the protease that is responsible for proteolytic activity in the assays presented here . in summary our data show that arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ is a ser protease with the catalytic triad formed by residues his asp and ser and the plant specific stretch is not directly involved in proteolysis . concerning the high similarity on amino acid level between _PROTEIN_ and and the absence of a conserved cys we propose that also the mammalian protease is ser type . to determine the location of _PROTEIN_ in the leaf _LOCATION_ we constructed a plasmid encoding a _METHOD_ fused to the n terminus of _PROTEIN_ . an inactive version of _PROTEIN_ was chosen to prevent its autodegradation in planta . a second plasmid encoding a cyan _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ fused to the c terminus of pre gmdh was constructed as a control . both fusion constructs were placed under the control of the constitutive cauliflower mosaic virus promoter . n. benthamiana leaves were transformed transiently by agrobacterium mediated leaf infection with the individual constructs and cotransformed with both plasmids . the micrographs in figure row a show a leaf segment from a transformant _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ under bright field illumination with a filter passing only the green _METHOD_ wavelength _METHOD_ and a filter passing the _METHOD_ . the merged bf _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ image identifies the _PROTEIN_ protein distinct spot within the cell . in row b corresponding series of a leaf from a transformant _PROTEIN_ the _METHOD_ tagged gmdh identifies it in the _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ . a leaf segment _PROTEIN_ both the _PROTEIN_ and the _METHOD_ tagged gmdh in row c demonstrates the colocalization of the two fluorescing proteins in the _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . this is a first clear cut demonstration of a colocalization of _PROTEIN_ together with a marker enzyme in the _LOCATION_ . because _PROTEIN_ processed pre gmdh in vitro and colocalized with gmdh in planta we examined whether _PROTEIN_ processes _PROTEIN_ containing proteins in vivo . the _PROTEIN_ knockout mutant carrying a tandem t dna insertion within the fifth intron was obtained from the salk institute arabidopsis insertion line mutant collection . a homozygous line of the mutant was isolated that was unable to transcribe the _PROTEIN_ gene as shown by reverse transcription pcr using the _PROTEIN_ gene encoding a chloroplast _PROTEIN_ protein as a control . to validate that _PROTEIN_ processes the _PROTEIN_ peptide of pre gmdh we complemented the _PROTEIN_ mutant line with _PROTEIN_ cdna under the control of the constitutively _PROTEIN_ camv promoter . three potential transformant lines were identified and confirmed for the presence of the _PROTEIN_ cdna in the _PROTEIN_ knockout background . immunoblot analysis revealed _PROTEIN_ processing of pre gmdh in the three _PROTEIN_ knockout lines complemented with _PROTEIN_ cdna . this _METHOD_ unambiguously that _PROTEIN_ is carrying out processing of the pre gmdh in planta . we analyzed processing of other _PROTEIN_ containing proteins such as keto acyl coa thiolase and long chain acyl coa synthetase _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ containing proteins such as sulfite oxidase _PROTEIN_ and isocitrate lyase _PROTEIN_ by _PROTEIN_ . whereas thiolase and _PROTEIN_ were not processed in the _PROTEIN_ mutant no difference between wild type and mutant line was observed for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ as proven by immunoblotting . these data indicate that _PROTEIN_ is the processing protease for _PROTEIN_ in higher eukaryotes .
