guard cell movement is induced by environmental and hormonal signals that cause changes in turgor through changes in uptake or release of solutes and water . several transporters mediating these fluxes at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ have been characterized however less is known about transport at endomembranes . _PROTEIN_ a member of a poorly understood cation/h exchanger gene family in arabidopsis is preferentially and highly _PROTEIN_ in guard cells as shown by _PROTEIN_ activity and by whole genome microarray . interestingly three independent homozygous mutants carrying t dna insertions in _PROTEIN_ showed reduction in light induced stomatal opening compared to wild type plants . to test the biochemical function of _PROTEIN_ cdna was _PROTEIN_ in a yeast mutant that lacks na /h antiporters and _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ na pumps . curiously _PROTEIN_ did not enhance tolerance of mutants to moderate na or high k stress . instead it restored growth of the mutant on medium with low k at slightly alkaline ph but had no effect on growth at acidic ph . green _METHOD_ protein tagged _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in mesophyll protoplasts was localized _PROTEIN_ to _LOCATION_ of the endosomal system . furthermore light induced stomatal opening of the arabidopsis mutants was insensitive to external ph and was impaired at high kcl . the results are consistent with the idea that in exchanging k for h _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ k homeostasis and influences ph under certain conditions . together these results provide genetic and biochemical evidence that one chx protein plays a critical role in osmoregulation through k fluxes and possibly ph modulation of an active endomembrane system in guard cells .
to obtain _PROTEIN_ cdna total rna was extracted from rosette leaves of week old arabidopsis plants and first strand cdna was used to amplify the coding sequence . the primers at the start and end of the open reading frame were designed based on the genomic sequence . a kb fragment was amplified and its sequence matched the coding sequence that is formed from five exons . the predicted _PROTEIN_ protein of residues has two domains a hydrophobic domain with to transmembrane spans at the amino half and a large hydrophilic domain of residues at the _PROTEIN_ end . the hydrophobic domain shows extensive similarity to the transmembrane domain of yeast protein although the long _PROTEIN_ tail of the two proteins did not align . these results suggest that the transport activities of _PROTEIN_ and yeast are similar . to test the transport function of _PROTEIN_ the coding sequence was cloned in pyes yeast _PROTEIN_ vector under the gal promoter . yeast mutants with disrupted gene alone exhibited no obvious phenotype so we _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in a yeast mutant . this strain lacks functional _LOCATION_ and pm localized na /h antiporters pm na pumps as well as the putative k /h exchanger . strain is highly sensitive to salt and to high k so the transformant _PROTEIN_ was tested for its ability to grow on moderate levels of na and very high k . surprisingly mutant yeast _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was consistently more sensitive on media containing mm na or mm k at various ph than the mutant yeast harboring the vector alone . mutants grew as well as _PROTEIN_ transformants on standard synthetic complete medium . these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ does not confer tolerance to salt stress . intriguingly _PROTEIN_ enhanced yeast mutant growth on slightly basic medium with no added k . at an external ph of to mutants grew relatively well with no added k . in _PROTEIN_ at acidic ph between and mutants grew consistently better than yeast transformants carrying _PROTEIN_ . curiously growth of mutants carrying the vector alone was retarded at phext whereas transformants harboring _PROTEIN_ continued to grow as well as at ph . thus strains carrying _PROTEIN_ had an advantage when the external ph was suggesting that _PROTEIN_ conferred an ability to sustain growth at slightly basic ph . we tested the effect of external k concentration on yeast growth at ph . transformants harboring _PROTEIN_ consistently grew better than mutants as long as the k level was kept low from approximately to mm . when no exogenous k was added the agar medium contained about mm k . increasing external kcl concentration beyond mm _PROTEIN_ the beneficial effect of _PROTEIN_ . because k is required to sustain growth of all cells the enhanced growth of transformants at low k levels would suggest that _PROTEIN_ has a role in acquiring k when the external ph is slightly alkaline or in _PROTEIN_ suitable cellular homeostasis for growth . this idea is supported by nearly similar growth exhibited by yeast mutants carrying either vector alone or _PROTEIN_ when k is raised to mm . yeast was shown before to confer tolerance to hygromycin as confirmed here in the strain . this strain has a functional wild type but lacks three na transporters _PROTEIN_ . however although transformants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ grew well at ph they showed no growth in the presence of hygromycin b. _PROTEIN_ did promote growth of mutants grown on yeast nitrogen base medium at ph similar to yeast . these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ and share similar but not identical activities . analyses of a guard cell transcriptome revealed that only one member of the chx gene family was highly _PROTEIN_ in guard cells . _PROTEIN_ showed little or no _PROTEIN_ in mesophyll cells whereas several other genes such as _PROTEIN_ showed low to moderate _PROTEIN_ . furthermore _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is particularly strong in guard cells as shown by the fold increase in normalized relative _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ compared to that of a k channel preferentially _PROTEIN_ in guard cells . to verify the microarray results _PROTEIN_ promoter driven gus activity was determined . arabidopsis plants were transformed with a construct containing a kb region upstream of the _PROTEIN_ orf transcriptionally fused to the gus reporter gene . seeds were collected from six independent transgenic lines and all six lines of _PROTEIN_ analyzed gave similar _PROTEIN_ patterns . striking gus activity was observed in guard cells located in expanded cotyledons and in hypocotyls of week old seedlings . three week old rosette leaves and cauline leaves also showed very high gus staining in guard cells . however gus staining was not detected in leaf pavement epidermal cells or in mesophyll cells . interestingly gus activity was also detected in guard cells of floral organs including the sepal anther and carpel . gus activity was not detected in the differentiated cells of roots although _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was only observed in the root cap of week old seedlings consistent with the microarray results of root cap cells . thus analyses of both _PROTEIN_ promoter gus _PROTEIN_ and guard cell specific transcriptome data clearly indicate selective _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in guard cells . when transiently _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis mesophyll protoplasts _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was visualized at the periphery of the _LOCATION_ and in the _LOCATION_ suggesting that it is localized at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ or in endomembranes . the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signal was compared with those from a soluble _METHOD_ _METHOD_ tagged to an _LOCATION_ retention sequence _METHOD_ or to markers such as sialyltransferase _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ for trans _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ for pm and _METHOD_ for _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . although _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ appeared to be localized to endomembranes its pattern did not coincide entirely with any of the markers tested . to determine its location more precisely the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and a _LOCATION_ marker _PROTEIN_ red _METHOD_ protein constructs were cotransfected into mesophyll protoplasts . of the cells that coexpressed both probes the pattern of green _METHOD_ labeled structures for the most part did not overlap with that of the red _METHOD_ indicating that _PROTEIN_ is not restricted to the trans _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . stably transformed plants _PROTEIN_ cauliflower mosaic virus driven _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ also showed perinuclear _METHOD_ signals in guard cells whereas soluble free _METHOD_ appeared inside the _LOCATION_ . strong _METHOD_ signals were also detected inside the cytoplasm of cells _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ relative to that _PROTEIN_ the free _METHOD_ control . together the results suggest that _PROTEIN_ is localized to a subpopulation of endomembranes although the protein does not appear to be a fixed resident of either the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ or pm . we postulated that _PROTEIN_ is associated with vesicles/membranes that traffic among various subcellular _LOCATION_ . to test this idea we examined the distribution of an endosome marker _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and of _PROTEIN_ at several focal planes . _METHOD_ signals of these two proteins were strikingly similar in several independent experiments . at the medial plane the signal was cytoplasmic and at or near the pm . at the submedial focal plane _METHOD_ signals were mostly cytoplasmic surrounding the _LOCATION_ . at the peripheral focal plane the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signal included several punctate regions . the _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ was functionally active as shown by its ability to restore growth of yeast at alkaline ph . _PROTEIN_ a related _PROTEIN_ is distributed on a subset of endosomes and is involved in regulating vesicular transport . these results suggest that an active _PROTEIN_ protein is associated with endosomal _LOCATION_ . to determine the in planta function of _PROTEIN_ we obtained three independent t dna insertional lines of arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ . two lines _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were identified in the signal database and one line _PROTEIN_ was obtained from genoplante . to confirm the t dna insertion site and select homozygous lines pcr based screening was performed using _PROTEIN_ specific primers and t dna primers . sequencing of the pcr amplified fragments confirmed that a t dna insertion was located within exon at coding sequence base of the _PROTEIN_ mutant inside the third exon at the coding sequence of _PROTEIN_ and within the second intron of _PROTEIN_ . we tested for _PROTEIN_ transcripts in leaves of all the mutants . reverse transcription pcr was performed using _PROTEIN_ gene specific primers located at either side of the t dna insertion using template cdna reverse transcribed from total leaf rna . no products were amplified indicating an absence of messages in all three alleles . the _PROTEIN_ mutants showed no obvious morphological or growth differences compared to wild type plants under standard growth conditions . overall the size and shape of the guard cells were indistinguishable between mutants and wild type plants . the highly specific _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in guard cells suggested that _PROTEIN_ plays a role in guard cell signaling and/or development . because we did not notice any developmental defects in the _PROTEIN_ knockout mutants we tested whether the _PROTEIN_ null mutants had any altered stomatal movement . we first compared light induced stomatal opening in mutants and wild type plants . excised leaves of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants were first exposed to white light for h in a solution containing mm kcl and mm mes at ph . in all three mutants the stomata failed to open as widely as wild type plants . the ratio of light induced stomatal opening per guard cell length in wild type plants and in mutants ranged from to and to respectively . thus stomatal opening was reduced by approximately in _PROTEIN_ mutants . we reduced the external kcl concentration in the opening solution to and mm . the aperture size was reduced slightly in wild type and mutant leaves exposed to mm k implying that guard cell movement is limited at low k concentration . however _PROTEIN_ mutants still showed approximately reduction in light induced stomatal opening _PROTEIN_ of the external k concentration indicating that the defect is not due to limited k level alone . using isolated epidermis we found that light induced stomatal opening was maximal at ph and . at basic ph and light induced opening was _PROTEIN_ in wild type plants consistent with inactivation by basic ph of inward rectifying k channels and activation of outward rectifying k channels in vicia fava guard cells . however mutants appeared to be insensitive to an acidic apoplastic ph that stimulated stomatal opening of wild type guard cells . thus the reduced stomatal aperture of _PROTEIN_ mutants was particularly apparent at ph and . at ph and mutants showed reduced stomatal aperture nearly similar to that of wild type . thus _PROTEIN_ mutants appeared to be unresponsive to ph regulation of guard cell movement . to test whether stomatal closure was affected isolated epidermis of wild type and _PROTEIN_ mutant leaves were first exposed to white light for h to induce stomatal opening and then incubated in aba to induce closure . the _PROTEIN_ in stomatal aperture was measured at min intervals for h. although the aperture size of wild type plants was larger than that of mutants before aba addition the percentage of closure of wild type was higher than that of mutants at all times . these results indicate that _PROTEIN_ mutants were responsive to aba however mutants were delayed in stomatal closure compared to wild type plants . results would suggest that _PROTEIN_ might also participate in events leading to stomatal closure .
