a number of arabidopsis mutants exhibit leaf reticulation having green veins that stand out against paler interveinal tissues fewer cells in the interveinal mesophyll and normal perivascular bundle sheath cells . here to examine the basis of leaf reticulation we analyzed the arabidopsis reticulata related gene family several members of which cause leaf reticulation when mutated . although transcripts of re _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were _PROTEIN_ detected in the bundle sheath cells of expanded leaves functional _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein was visualized in the chloroplast _LOCATION_ of all photosynthetic cells . leaf reticulation in the re and _PROTEIN_ loss of function mutants occurred along with accumulation of reactive oxygen species in a photoperiod dependent manner . a comparison of re and _PROTEIN_ leaf messenger rna _PROTEIN_ profiles showed more than genes were similarly misexpressed in both mutants . in addition metabolic profiles of mature leaves revealed that several biosynthetic pathways downstream of pyruvate are altered in re and _PROTEIN_ . double mutant analysis showed that only re _PROTEIN_ and exhibited synergistic phenotypes indicating functional redundancy . the redundancy between re and its closest paralog _PROTEIN_ was confirmed by overexpressing _PROTEIN_ in re mutants which partially suppressed leaf reticulation . our results show that rer family members can be divided into four functional modules with divergent functions . moreover these results provide insights into the origin of the reticulated phenotype suggesting that the rer proteins functionally interconnect photoperiodic growth amino acid homeostasis and reactive oxygen species metabolism during arabidopsis leaf growth .
work on single reticulate mutants has provided some insights into the nature of the reticulate phenotype to extend these results we examined a related gene family . the first mutant with reticulate leaves isolated in arabidopsis was re . loss of function mutations of re which encodes a protein of unknown function cause increased sensitivity to ozone and specifically reduce mesophyll cell numbers in the early stages of leaf organogenesis . we identified six arabidopsis genes encoding proteins with high sequence similarity to re and named these genes _PROTEIN_ to . the rer family is plant specific and its members are present in all plant genomes sequenced so far . based on gene structure and amino acid sequence similarity rer proteins can be grouped into three pairs re _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and and one single protein . the predicted and _PROTEIN_ proteins show amino acid sequence identity and and _PROTEIN_ lack introns and are arranged in tandem suggesting that they arose from a recent duplication event . several studies have identified most rer family proteins as integral components of the chloroplast envelope . all proteins of the rer family contain a plant specific conserved amino acid domain of unknown function _PROTEIN_ . in silico prediction of transmembrane domains revealed two conserved tm helixes and within the _PROTEIN_ motif and another one in the c terminal region of _PROTEIN_ and which is consistent with their localization in the _LOCATION_ . by contrast and were the most divergent members of the family because they also contained a _PROTEIN_ domain and have been identified in the _LOCATION_ lumen proteome . _METHOD_ ethyl methanesulfonate t dna insertion . to examine the functions of these genes we next identified and characterized loss of function mutant alleles . from available collections of gene indexed insertion lines we identified homozygous lines containing a transfer dna insertion in each of the rer genes except and _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ transcript levels as measured by quantitative reverse transcription pcr were severely reduced in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . however the rosette and leaf phenotypes of three _PROTEIN_ homozygous mutants were indistinguishable from those of wild type plants of their columbia genetic background . adaxial epidermis and palisade mesophyll histology as well as vein patterning seemed unaffected by the _PROTEIN_ mutations . we did not observe any differences from the wild type in _PROTEIN_ homozygous roots inflorescences flowers or siliques . a t dna insertion allele of reduced the mrna levels significantly and caused subtle leaf lamina reticulation and reduced leaf growth phenotypes that were only obvious under low light fluency . we identified two t dna insertion alleles of and one of which also showed significantly reduced mrna levels . as seen in the _PROTEIN_ mutants leaves and rosettes of and were phenotypically wild type in all conditions tested . the three mutants isolated previously also display reticulate leaves . a total of phenotypically recessive plants derived from a col cross were used as a mapping population for linkage analysis which allowed us to delimit a kb region near the upper telomere of chromosome this region includes both and _PROTEIN_ . we sequenced both genes in the mutants and in their wild type landsberg _LOCATION_ ecotype and found transitions in the _PROTEIN_ coding region in all mutants . changes gly to glu changes gly to ser and carries a nonsense mutation that changes trp to a premature stop codon which would produce a truncated protein lacking residues of its c terminus . all these mutations affect conserved residues in the _PROTEIN_ protein domain . because and were found to be alleles of _PROTEIN_ we renamed them as _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ respectively . similar to other reticulate mutants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ homozygotes characteristically displayed green tissues surrounding the veins and a paler leaf lamina . the _PROTEIN_ mutations also caused mild leaf hyponasty and deep indentations on the leaf margin both traits being obvious at all stages of leaf expansion . paradermal differential interference contrast micrographs showed a disorganized mesophyll with increased air spaces in _PROTEIN_ cotyledons and leaves . all _PROTEIN_ mutants showed a strong reduction in cell area and in the lobe sizes of their adaxial epidermal pavement cells . these results indicate that in _PROTEIN_ mutant leaves cell number is reduced in the mesophyll and cell expansion is reduced in the epidermis . consistent with reduced cell expansion the and _LOCATION_ populations of the first leaf pair at and d after stratification were lower in _PROTEIN_ than in ler similar to that found for the strong reticulate mutant _PROTEIN_ . transgenic _PROTEIN_ homozygous plants _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ construct had leaves indistinguishable from those of ler thus confirming that all the phenotypes displayed by the _PROTEIN_ mutants are caused by loss of function of the _PROTEIN_ gene . in addition to identifying redundant functions in the rer family we also looked for specific or divergent functions . we found that in addition to the reticulated phenotype of their leaves the _PROTEIN_ alleles described in this work caused additional defects in seedling germination and early growth . to look for embryonic patterning defects we dissected siliques of the _PROTEIN_ mutants and found a high proportion of aberrant embryos . in some cases globular embryos contained two cell rows in the suspensor as opposed to the single row of cells found in the wild type . in many cases the heart embryo stage of the _PROTEIN_ mutants showed clear asymmetries in their apical domains . for the seeds that germinated of _PROTEIN_ homozygotes showed an abortive seedling phenotype characterized by dark green small rosettes that do not develop roots . moreover to of the _PROTEIN_ rosettes with reticulate leaves contained only one cotyledon with the first node leaf arising opposite to it . in to of these plants the first two leaves were fused . however for seedlings that developed roots we found no significant differences in the length of the primary root of either _PROTEIN_ or re mutants compared with ler . also the morphology of their distal root meristem did not differ between the re or _PROTEIN_ mutants and their wild type ler . as the _PROTEIN_ embryogenesis defect is similar to mutants affected in auxin signaling we visualized the _PROTEIN_ of the _METHOD_ auxin reporter during embryogenesis . in embryos at the torpedo stage we found only a peak of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in the most distal cells of the embryo both in the wild type and re as well as in _PROTEIN_ embryos displaying a wild type phenotype . however most of the aberrant _PROTEIN_ embryos analyzed _PROTEIN_ the reporter gene also in the apical cells of the embryo proper . postembryonically _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was found increased in leaf primordia and in root tips of _PROTEIN_ above that found in their wild type ler and re mutants . taken together our results suggest that _PROTEIN_ is specifically required for embryogenesis in concert with auxin . to further characterize the functions of rer family members we examined the _PROTEIN_ patterns of each gene gathering information on the temporal and spatial _PROTEIN_ of rer family members from publicly available microarray data . the _PROTEIN_ levels of re and _PROTEIN_ in different organs and developmental stages were comparable in the studied data set . _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ mostly mirrored that of although _PROTEIN_ was highly _PROTEIN_ in seeds and specifically in the _PROTEIN_ stages of embryo development . and were similarly _PROTEIN_ except in mature pollen and young leaves where _PROTEIN_ was higher than that of . for each gene of the rer family we retrieved the most significantly coexpressed genes from the _PROTEIN_ ii database several genes encoding enzymes involved in amino acid biosynthesis were coexpressed only with _PROTEIN_ . we then examined the spatial _PROTEIN_ pattern of re _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ using transcriptional fusions of their upstream regulatory sequences to the _PROTEIN_ gene . re was predominantly _PROTEIN_ in the proximal region of young leaf primordia . by contrast _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ in the distal region of young leaf primordia . _PROTEIN_ of re and _PROTEIN_ partially overlapped in developing leaves whereas in mature leaves their _PROTEIN_ was indistinguishable and restricted to some cells associated with the vasculature and the hydathodes . similar to _PROTEIN_ the highest _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was observed in the distal region of young leaf primordia . in developing and fully expanded leaves _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was higher in the bundle sheath cells and the hydathodes than in other tissues . paradermic sections of mature leaves excised from repro gus and _PROTEIN_ gus transgenic lines confirmed the higher _PROTEIN_ of these genes in the bundle sheath cells . in the root meristem re _PROTEIN_ was high in tier of the columella in the stem cell niche where _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was undetectable . interestingly _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was detected in the mitotic pool of the root meristem . in the differentiation zone of roots however the _PROTEIN_ of re _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ fully overlapped and was restricted to the cells surrounding the vasculature . our gus _PROTEIN_ analysis showed that re _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were also similarly _PROTEIN_ in pollen a result that we independently confirmed by in situ hybridization with a re antisense probe . during embryogenesis faint gus staining was observed from torpedo stage onwards in embryos _PROTEIN_ the repro gus construct whereas no staining was found in _PROTEIN_ gus embryos . by contrast _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was higher during embryogenesis from the heart stage onwards and was restricted to the adaxial side of the cotyledons . to determine the localization of the _PROTEIN_ protein we used the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ construct . in mature leaves the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein colocalizes with the chlorophyll _METHOD_ from the palisade mesophyll and spongy mesophyll chloroplasts as well as with the chloroplasts of guard cells and of the hypocotyl . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was also detected in the nonphotosynthetic root leucoplasts . after chlorophyll bleaching _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ remained confined to the periphery of mature chloroplasts in leaf tissues . the _METHOD_ signal of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein was higher in small immature _LOCATION_ . these results which were obtained using a functional _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein demonstrate that _PROTEIN_ localizes to the chloroplast _LOCATION_ of all _LOCATION_ containing cells . based on their protein sequence similarity and _PROTEIN_ patterns we suspected that the re and _PROTEIN_ paralog pair might have a redundant role during leaf development . to test this hypothesis we crossed reticulated re re and re mutants to nonreticulated _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants . among the populations studied we obtained approximately of mutants displaying the characteristic phenotype described previously for re mutants as well as an additional of seedlings exhibiting stunted rosette growth with small and reticulated leaves . in the absence of genetic interaction between re and _PROTEIN_ mutations which are unlinked one would expect about reticulated seedlings in the generation . one hundred and eighty reticulate plants were genotyped and unambiguously found to be re/re _PROTEIN_ . all the seedlings exhibiting a severe phenotype were re/re _PROTEIN_ and developed tiny inflorescences containing flowers with aberrant morphology . they were however able to yield mature siliques that contained aborted ovules and embryos and exhibited asynchronous seed maturation . about of the seeds derived from selfed re/re _PROTEIN_ plants displayed reticulate leaves whereas the remaining had the same severe phenotype as their parents they were genotyped and confirmed to be re/re _PROTEIN_ and re/re _PROTEIN_ respectively . from these results we concluded that the re/re _PROTEIN_ plants are escapers because most re _PROTEIN_ gametes are lethal only a very low proportion of which survive past the phenocritical stage where the re and _PROTEIN_ redundant functions are required . to evaluate the redundancy of re and _PROTEIN_ we next tested whether _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ could rescue a mutant in re . the _PROTEIN_ of wild type re under the control of the promoter re completely rescued the reticulate leaf phenotype of re mutants . in addition the _PROTEIN_ transgene partially rescued the reticulate leaf phenotype of the re mutant . neither the re nor the _PROTEIN_ transgenes altered the leaf morphologies of the wild type or the _PROTEIN_ mutants which indicates that an excess of re and _PROTEIN_ function is not detrimental for leaf development . also the phenotype of re was not modified by the functional _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein . because the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in leaves fully overlaps with that of _PROTEIN_ and partially with that of re we combined some of their mutant alleles to study genetic interactions . the phenotypes of all the re _PROTEIN_ double mutants obtained were interpreted as additive because they merely shared the morphological traits of both parentals . in the generation of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ crosses a phenotypic segregation was obtained indicating no genetic interaction . we confirmed the genotype of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutants which were phenotypically indistinguishable from _PROTEIN_ . in addition neither the re nor the _PROTEIN_ transgenes rescued the reticulate leaf phenotype of _PROTEIN_ homozygotes . to ascertain if the and genes also act redundantly we crossed the phenotypically wild type and mutants and found in their and progeny seedlings with small rosettes chlorotic leaves and retarded growth whose genotype was shown to be . we then studied double mutant combinations of and with either re or _PROTEIN_ . in all cases the double mutant plants were indistinguishable from their re or _PROTEIN_ parental lines . in contrast to the results found previously for mutations affecting the same paralog pairs re _PROTEIN_ and we found no genetic interactions between any pair of re and rer alleles from different paralog gene pairs _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ suggesting a degree of specialization of rer function between paralogs . leaves of the re and _PROTEIN_ mutants contain fewer cells and larger air spaces in their palisade mesophyll than their wild types . the proportions of and _LOCATION_ populations in the first leaf pair at and das were not significantly different in re re and _PROTEIN_ mutants compared with ler . these results indicate that the pool of mitotic cells were not altered by the re and _PROTEIN_ mutations . hence local cell death might account for the reticulation observed in re and _PROTEIN_ mutant leaves . we used trypan blue staining to examine whether mutant leaves contained dead cells . in the wild type leaves at das we only found trypan blue staining in some elongated cells neighboring xylem vessels . in the strongly reticulated _PROTEIN_ mutant we found trypan blue staining accumulated around the vasculature and in some palisade mesophyll cells . similar accumulation of trypan blue was observed in the perivascular mesophyll of re leaves . we also found increased trypan blue staining around the vasculature of _PROTEIN_ leaves compared with both ler and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ plants . the proportion of _LOCATION_ debris estimated as the _LOCATION_ population less than was slightly but significantly increased in re and _PROTEIN_ leaves and additional _METHOD_ peaks were shown for the _LOCATION_ populations greater than both features being indicative of _LOCATION_ with degraded dna . in plants cell death can involve the accumulation of reactive oxygen species and some of the re mutants were shown to overproduce ros in their leaves . to study the spatial distribution of ros in re and rer we infiltrated leaves with diaminobenzidine which reacts with hydrogen peroxide allowing its visualization as a brown colored precipitate . enhanced accumulation was confirmed in the mesophyll surrounding the vasculature of re and _PROTEIN_ leaves . interestingly leaves of _PROTEIN_ which are not visibly reticulated also exhibited dab precipitate around the veins weaker than in the re mutants but stronger than in col . a similar pattern of dab precipitate in the mesophyll surrounding the vasculature was observed in _PROTEIN_ leaves but absent both in ler and the transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgene in a _PROTEIN_ background . we confirmed that the dab precipitates observed were specifically dependent on by incubating leaves with catalase . photoperiod is a major determinant of leaf development and has been shown to modulate gene _PROTEIN_ amino acid profiles stomatal index and cell death in arabidopsis leaves . analysis of photoperiod dependent growth phenotypes revealed that the reticulate pigmentation of re and rer mutants was rescued by a short day photoperiod . the growth rate of re re and _PROTEIN_ however was still slower than that of their respective wild type plants . by contrast _PROTEIN_ remained pale and exhibited a dwarf phenotype also under short photoperiod . next we explored whether photoperiod modulates the accumulation of light induced ros production in the rer mutants . the pattern of dab staining indicated accumulation of in cells surrounding the vasculature in all re and rer mutant plants grown under long photoperiod in soil comparable to that of the rer mutants grown on agar plates . when grown under short photoperiod however neither re rer nor _PROTEIN_ mutants showed any enhancement of ros staining . the photoperiod dependent pale green phenotypes of the rer mutants and the strong signal of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ observed in small developing chloroplasts raised the question of whether rer family members are required for appropriate development of photosynthetic pigment protein complexes . thus possible photoperiod dependent adjustments in _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ protein complexes were studied by blue native gel electrophoresis . this revealed very similar patterns of _LOCATION_ protein complexes in rer mutant and wild type plants irrespective of the length of the photoperiod . therefore the basic structures of the photosynthetic machinery seem not to be drastically affected in the re and rer mutants studied . to identify specific changes in the transcriptome of the re and _PROTEIN_ mutants that might account for their shared leaf reticulation phenotype we carried out a microarray analysis using rna extracted from re and _PROTEIN_ mutant rosettes . we found differentially _PROTEIN_ genes in re and in _PROTEIN_ compared with ler . fifty six percent of the identified genes were misregulated in both mutants and both the sign and the magnitude of their fold change matched between the two mutants . to visualize our microarray results in the context of cellular pathways and processes we employed the mapman tool . we found a highly significant enrichment for misregulated genes belonging to the categories of stress signaling and dna in the re and _PROTEIN_ mutants . the most overrepresented gene ontology categories for the commonly down regulated genes in re and _PROTEIN_ were those of defense response phosphorylation and kinase activity . several genes involved in salicylic acid biosynthesis and response _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were similarly down regulated in both the re and _PROTEIN_ mutants . to validate our microarray results we performed quantitative rt pcr analyses of several genes selected from the sets of up regulated and down regulated genes in re and _PROTEIN_ mutants and in every case the quantitative rt pcr results matched our microarray data . because re and _PROTEIN_ mutants share similar leaf phenotypes finding metabolites whose levels are similar but different from the wild type could help to identify the common metabolic targets of re and _PROTEIN_ . from the comparative analyses of the metabolites identified in leaves from re re and _PROTEIN_ mutants and those of their wild type ler we spotted metabolites whose levels differed significantly between the mutants and the wild type . metabolite accumulation in re and re mutants was highly similar as expected for two alleles that similarly affect re function . interestingly metabolites showed similar accumulation profiles in all three mutants with that were _PROTEIN_ and three that were increased in the mutants compared with the wild type . we observed a _PROTEIN_ in the levels of the branched amino acids ile and val and the aromatic amino acids tyr phe and trp as well as ala and met in re and _PROTEIN_ mutant leaves . in addition the re and _PROTEIN_ mutants also displayed a reduction of shikimate and of the downstream products of its pathway such as aromatic amino acids cinnamic acid sinapate and indole acetonitrile . _PROTEIN_ is used as a substrate in the shikimate pathway for the biosynthesis of aromatic amino acids and in the tricarboxylic acid cycle . the tca cycle intermediates succinate fumarate and malate were _PROTEIN_ in the re and _PROTEIN_ mutants compared with the wild type . in addition the re and _PROTEIN_ mutants contain lower levels of pyruvate . in conclusion the metabolic profiles of mature leaves in re and _PROTEIN_ mutants revealed that several biosynthetic pathways downstream of _PROTEIN_ are altered in the mutants . to determine whether other reticulate mutants might function by common _METHOD_ we also looked for a potential genetic interaction with re or _PROTEIN_ . the leaves of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ semidominant mutants whose wild type alleles encode the subunits of the _PROTEIN_ required for the conversion of orn into citrulline in the arg biosynthesis pathway display green primary and secondary veins with a paler lamina . leaf reticulation in the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants can be fully rescued by exogenously applied citrulline but orn reduces overall growth of these two mutants further than in their wild type ler . we found that re and _PROTEIN_ seedlings display a similar growth reduction to ler on orn supplemented plates . by contrast all the re but not rer mutants studied displayed severe growth retardation and enhanced leaf reticulation when grown on citrulline supplemented plates _PROTEIN_ of their ler or col genetic background . consistent with these results all the double mutant combinations of _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ with re or _PROTEIN_ caused additive leaf phenotypes . nitric oxide _PROTEIN_ is required for chloroplast photosynthetic function . the _PROTEIN_ null allele which causes pale green leaves additively interacts with re and _PROTEIN_ . mutant alleles of genes encoding ribosomal proteins cause leaf reticulation and synergistically interact with alleles of asymmetric _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ genes . we wondered whether an overall reduction in the cell numbers in the mesophyll as observed in re and _PROTEIN_ mutant leaves would constitutively enhance the leaf _PROTEIN_ defects caused by the and mutations and produce radialized leaves . however all the double mutants obtained involving or with re or _PROTEIN_ alleles displayed an additive leaf phenotype consisting of asymmetric and reticulate leaves . hence an overall reduction of palisade mesophyll cell numbers is not sufficient to enhance the and leaf phenotypes . given than an additive double mutant phenotype is widely accepted as a sign of absence of a functional relationship between the mutated genes under study our results indicate that the functions of re and _PROTEIN_ are not related to those of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ .
