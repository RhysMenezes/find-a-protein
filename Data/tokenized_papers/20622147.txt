in plants as in animals dna is constantly subject to chemical modification . uv b irradiation is a major genotoxic agent and has significant effects on plant growth and development . through forward genetic screening we identified a uv b sensitive mutant in arabidopsis thaliana in which _PROTEIN_ of encoding a cockayne syndrome a like protein is reduced due to insertion of a t dna in the promoter region . arabidopsis lacking or its homolog is more sensitive to uv b and the genotoxic drug methyl methanesulfonate and exhibits reduced transcription coupled repair activity . yeast two hybrid analysis indicated that both and b interact with _PROTEIN_ . coimmunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that and b associate with the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ complex in arabidopsis . a split yellow _METHOD_ protein assay showed that this interaction occurs in the _LOCATION_ consistent with the idea that the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ csa complex functions as a _LOCATION_ ubiquitin ligase . and b formed heterotetramers in arabidopsis . taken together our data suggest that the plant _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and b complex represents a unique mechanism to promote ubiquitination of substrates in response to dna damage .
to identify novel components that regulate the response of arabidopsis to uv b we screened a t dna activation tagged pool by monitoring seedling growth rate after uv b irradiation . several mutants defective in their response to uv b were recovered . one of them was more sensitive to uv b stress than the wild type . when d old mutant and wild type seedlings were exposed to uv b for min and then incubated in a growth chamber for d the cotyledons of plants were bleached and plant growth was reduced relative to that of the wild type . consistent with this observation when wild type and plants were treated with _METHOD_ a genotoxic chemical that produces heat labile dna damage the reduction in growth of the mutant was more severe than that of the wild type . using thermal asymmetric interlaced pcr insertion of the t dna fragment which leads to the _PROTEIN_ transcription of was detected in the promoter of _GENE_ bp upstream of the translation start codon . the gene contains nine exons and eight introns and encodes a amino acid protein with a predicted molecular _METHOD_ of kd and an isoelectric point of . the protein contains four repeats and shares sequence similarity with human csa . hereafter we refer to as and the mutant as . the arabidopsis genome encodes another protein which is identical to . in mammalian cells csa is known to play a critical role in dna damage repair . to determine whether the uv b sensitive phenotype of the mutant is due to the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ of two arabidopsis mutant lines with t dna insertions in the gene were obtained from the _PROTEIN_ . the t dna insertion sites in these mutants were determined by pcr using specific primers and the t dna left border primers were found in the third or fifth exons of the gene respectively . the absence of a full length transcript in the and mutants was confirmed by rt pcr analysis . when d old mutant and wild type seedlings were exposed to uv b for min and then incubated in a growth chamber for d the mutants were more sensitive to uv b than the wild type with more bleached cotyledons and a slower growth rate this defect could be complemented by _PROTEIN_ of the cdna in the mutants . to determine if dna repair is involved in uv b sensitivity wild type and plants were treated with _METHOD_ at and ppm . the growth of the mutants was dramatically reduced relative to that of the wild type this defect was also complemented by _PROTEIN_ of the cdna in the mutants . taken together these results suggest that the uv b sensitive phenotype may be due to a difference in dna repair ability in the mutant relative to in the wild type . the amino acid sequence of is identical to that of . however single mutants are sensitive to uv stress suggesting that the functions of these two proteins do not fully overlap . to determine if also plays a role in dna damage repair two t dna insertion lines and in were obtained from the _PROTEIN_ and the t dna insertion sites and the absence of full length transcripts were determined . when mutant and wild type seedlings were treated with uv b and _METHOD_ sensitive phenotypes were also observed in the mutants . _PROTEIN_ of cdna in the mutants under the control of the promoter complemented the mutant phenotypes indicating that is also involved in the response of arabidopsis to uv b irradiation . our data demonstrate that and function in the response of the plant to uv b irradiation . to determine the tissue specific _PROTEIN_ of these two genes promoter regions of and were fused to the _PROTEIN_ reporter gene . the resulting constructs were transferred into wild type arabidopsis . for each construct independent transgenic lines were analyzed for gus _PROTEIN_ . while the intensity of gus staining in each of the independent lines was variable the tissue specific localization was the same . as shown in supplemental figures to online gus driven by either the or promoter was _PROTEIN_ throughout young seedlings and in leaves _METHOD_ flowers and siliques . to determine the subcellular localization of and green florescent protein _METHOD_ was fused to the n terminus of each protein and _PROTEIN_ was driven by the cauliflower mosaic virus promoter . when the fusion constructs were transferred to col plants _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ signals were observed in the _LOCATION_ . in mammalian cells csa associates with _PROTEIN_ to form an ubiquitin ligase that promotes the ubiquitination of csb during the regulation of dna damage repair through tcr . in arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was recently shown to function in _PROTEIN_ during uv stress . to determine if the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ complex and and b interact genetically we generated _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ double mutants . six day old wild type single and double mutant seedlings were treated with different concentrations of _METHOD_ and d old plants were treated with uv b . for each treatment growth reductions of the single and double mutants were not significantly different from each other but were more severe than that of the wild type . these data suggest that and b may function in the same pathway as _PROTEIN_ . we then determined if and b interact with _PROTEIN_ as csa protein does in mammalian cells . arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ was cotransformed with either or b into yeast and yeast two hybrid analysis showed that both interact with _PROTEIN_ . to determine if and b can form a complex with _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in planta a flag tag in a cluster of three tandem repeats was fused to the c terminus of either or b under the control of the promoter and the constructs were transformed into their corresponding mutants . transgenic lines that rescued the mutant phenotypes and had relatively low _PROTEIN_ levels of the or b transgene were used for coimmunoprecipitation assays . proteins were extracted from the transgenic plants and or b flag was immunoprecipitated with anti flag conjugated agarose . pull down products were analyzed on immunoblots with anti _PROTEIN_ and anti _PROTEIN_ antibodies . the results demonstrate that both and b pulled down _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ indicating that both form complexes with _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . if _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and b functions in dna damage repair in arabidopsis the complex should be located in the _LOCATION_ . to determine if this is the case we cloned the _PROTEIN_ or cdnas into the n terminus of the split yellow _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ vector puc _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and cloned _PROTEIN_ into the c terminus of the puc _PROTEIN_ vector _METHOD_ . different combinations of _PROTEIN_ and b/puc _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were cotransfected into onion epidermal cells which were analyzed by confocal microscopy to detect _METHOD_ bimolecular florescence complementation . the _METHOD_ signal was detected in the _LOCATION_ in _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ cotransfection assays . we did not observe _METHOD_ signal with any construct individually or with combinations of any gene and empty puc _METHOD_ vector . these results indicate that the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and b complex is localized to the _LOCATION_ . genomic dna is one of the major molecules affected by uv b irradiation . uv b irradiation results in phototransformation and causes _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ to accumulate which turns on dna damage repair processes . to compare dna damage in the mutants and wild type plants wild type and mutant seedlings were exposed to increasing doses of uv b radiation for min transferred to a growth chamber and analyzed for dna damage repair after and h. genomic dna was extracted from the plants and subjected to an elisa assay to measure _PROTEIN_ induction . the wild type and the mutants accumulated similar amounts of _PROTEIN_ immediately after the plants were exposed to increasing doses of uv b however the wild type accumulated less _PROTEIN_ than the mutants after dna repair . these results indicate that the wild type and mutant had similar levels of uv b based dna damage and that the dna damage repair machinery is impaired in the and mutants . in mammalian cells _PROTEIN_ ligase functions in dna damage repair through tcr . to determine if and b are also involved in tcr genomic dna was extracted from these plants either immediately after treatment or after a h incubation to allow dna repair . the dna was digested with bamhi and spei ecori and sali ecori and xhoi psti and xhoi or bamhi and xbai to release or kb fragments respectively containing the intronless _GENE_ _GENE_ _GENE_ _GENE_ or _GENE_ genes and then treated with endonuclease v to remove the damaged dna . the dnas were subsequently analyzed by dna gel blot analysis and probed with either the transcribed or nontranscribed strands . as shown in figure after the h incubation uv b induced dna damage for the transcribed strands was repaired more efficiently in the wild type than in either of the two mutants while dna damage repair for the nontranscribed strand was similar for the wild type and the mutants . these results indicate that and b function in tcr . previous reports demonstrated that the wdxr motif in the domain is required for _PROTEIN_ associated _PROTEIN_ proteins to physically bind to _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis . to identify the specific domain that interacts with _PROTEIN_ and b were divided into three fragments amino acid which contains one domain _PROTEIN_ amino acid which contains the second domain that harbors a wdxr motif and amino acid to the c terminus which contains the last two domains . full length and b and the three peptides corresponding to each protein were cotransformed with _PROTEIN_ into yeast for analysis . _PROTEIN_ interaction strength was similar with full length and b and the peptides . to determine whether interacts with _PROTEIN_ in planta the tag was fused to the _PROTEIN_ or peptides for each gene under the control of the promoter . the six resulting plasmids were transformed into their corresponding knockout mutants . proteins were extracted from the transgenic plants and flag tagged proteins were immunoprecipitated with anti flag conjugated agarose . the pull down products were then analyzed on immunoblots with anti _PROTEIN_ or anti _PROTEIN_ antibodies . similar amounts of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were pulled down by and b and and b but not by the _PROTEIN_ and peptides suggesting that the region is responsible for the interaction of and b with the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ complex . both and b contain a wdxr motif in the domain of the region . to determine if this wdxr motif is critical for and b interaction with _PROTEIN_ six conserved amino acids in the wdxr motif were converted to ala and arg was changed to ala as a control . interactions between the mutant proteins and their corresponding wild type proteins were analyzed in assays or fused to tags under control of the promoter and _PROTEIN_ in their corresponding mutant backgrounds for coimmunoprecipitation assays . in yeast the interaction between _PROTEIN_ and and b was reduced by mutations at positions or when compared with interactions with the wild type proteins . however mutations in leu thr or arg did not alter the interaction . to further determine if these mutations affect the interaction between and b and the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ complex the seven mutant proteins used above were _PROTEIN_ individually in either or csaatlb plants . transgenic lines with similar and b _PROTEIN_ levels were used for further studies . as was observed in assays mutations at positions asp trp asp or arg reduced the interaction between and b and the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ complex but mutations at leu thr or arg had no effect compared with wild type and b . these results indicate that the wdxr motif in and b is also important for the formation of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and b complex in arabidopsis . single mutations at positions asp trp asp or arg in and b reduced their ability to interact with _PROTEIN_ . to determine if the wdxr motif is essential for the interaction between and b and the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ complex we generated four and b mutant genes each containing two mutations two mutant genes each containing three mutations and one mutant gene combining four mutations for analysis in yeast and in planta . in yeast when compared with the single mutation constructs the double mutations further reduced the interaction between and b and _PROTEIN_ . however the mutant had less effect than the other three . the two triple mutants were still able to interact with _PROTEIN_ but the interaction was weaker than that of the three double mutants . mutations in all four residues abolished any interaction . our results demonstrate that and are important for forming the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and b complex . similar results were observed in planta the interaction between and b and the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ complex _PROTEIN_ more significantly with increasing mutations and was abolished with quadruple mutations . to determine if interaction between and b and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is required for uv b and _METHOD_ tolerance in arabidopsis the transgenic lines used for coimmunoprecipitation assays were treated with uv b or _METHOD_ . when we determined if the _PROTEIN_ of the or b _PROTEIN_ or peptides rescued the and b uv b and _METHOD_ phenotypes surprisingly we found that and b but not _PROTEIN_ and could partially suppress the corresponding mutant phenotypes . based on the model that domains provide an interaction platform for the substrates our data suggest that the presence of only one domain with a wdxr motif is sufficient for and b interaction with _PROTEIN_ but not for uv b and _METHOD_ responses and that while the wdxr motif is sufficient for and b to form the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and b complex the other three domains may be required for interaction with and b substrates . when the and b genes with single mutations in the wdxr motif were _PROTEIN_ in their corresponding mutants the interaction between and b and the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ complex was reduced and the uv b or _METHOD_ sensitive phenotypes of the mutants were only partially rescued . and b with mutations or which did not affect the interaction between or b and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ complex complemented the mutant phenotypes to the level seen for wild type and b . transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ and b containing additional mutations in the wdxr motif showed reductions in the rescue of the uv b or _METHOD_ sensitive phenotypes that correlated with increasing mutation numbers . the and double _PROTEIN_ and b mutants had similar uv b and _METHOD_ sensitive phenotypes suggesting that and b function in the same pathway with _PROTEIN_ and that their functions in response to uv b irradiation may not fully overlap . because and b are both found in the _LOCATION_ share significant sequence identity and their transcripts are also present in similar tissues one possible explanation for the and b mutant phenotypes is that and b form a complex . because the peptides partially rescue their mutant phenotypes and contain a wdxr motif it is possible that the wdxr motif also plays a role in the formation of a and b complex . to test this the myc plasmid was cotransformed with the _PROTEIN_ or plasmids into arabidopsis leaf protoplasts . the protein was immunoprecipitated with anti myc or anti flag conjugated agarose . the pull down products were then analyzed on immunoblots with anti flag or anti myc antibodies . as expected but not _PROTEIN_ or was pulled down by . because and b share amino acid sequence similarity they may also be capable of forming homodimers in planta . to test this combinations of epitope tagged and b or or b fragments were cotransfected into wild type leaf protoplasts . proteins were extracted immunoprecipitated and analyzed on immunoblots . the results demonstrate that and b interacted with each other and also could self interact through their peptides . using a split _METHOD_ assay in onion cells the interactions between and b and the self interactions for and b were shown to take place in the _LOCATION_ . these results suggest that and b are capable of forming complexes in the plant . to assess the oligomerization state of and b in planta soluble proteins were extracted from the transgenic plants harboring myc or flag or b and loaded onto a superdex gel filtration column . the major and b proteins eluted in a peak corresponding to a species with a molecular _METHOD_ of kd in these three transgenic lines in agreement with the tetramer size of the and b proteins . taken together our data suggest that the and b proteins likely form heterotetramers rather than homotetramers in vivo . to further confirm this was transformed into the mutant and was transformed into the csaatla mutant and the proteins were analyzed by gel filtration chromatography . the major and b flag containing fraction eluted at kd . these data show that in the absence of either or the remaining csa protein likely _METHOD_ a dimer . the wdxr motif is not only essential for the interaction with _PROTEIN_ but is also required for and b self interaction . if this is the case mutations in the motif should lead to disassociation of the and b dimers . to test this proteins were extracted from transgenic plants harboring or . the major and b flag containing gel filtration fraction eluted at kd in agreement with the predicted size of the monomer proteins . this result is consistent with the analysis that demonstrated that mutations in these four amino acids abolished interaction with and also with itself . in the or b protein only the domain in the region contains the wdxr motif . the peptides interact with _PROTEIN_ and partially rescue their corresponding mutant phenotypes . when proteins were extracted from the or b _PROTEIN_ or transgenic plants the major or b flag containing gel filtration fraction eluted at kd . however both the a or b _PROTEIN_ flag and containing fractions eluted at kd . these results indicate that and b form heterotetramers in the plant .
