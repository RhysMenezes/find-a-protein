_PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ encodes a putative o linked n acetyl _PROTEIN_ transferase that is genetically defined as a negatively acting component of the gibberellin signal transduction pathway . analysis of arabidopsis plants containing aspy gus reporter gene reveals thatspy is _PROTEIN_ throughout the life of the plant and in most plant organs examined . in addition to being _PROTEIN_ in all organs where phenotypes due to spy mutations have been reported _PROTEIN_ gus is _PROTEIN_ in the root . examination of the roots of wild type spy andgai plants revealed phenotypes indicating that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ play a role in root development . a secondspy gus reporter gene lacking part of the _PROTEIN_ promoter was inactive suggesting that sequences in the first exon and/or intron are required for detectable _PROTEIN_ . using both subcellular fractionation and visualization of a _PROTEIN_ green _METHOD_ protein fusion protein that is able to rescue thespy mutant phenotype the majority of _PROTEIN_ protein was shown to be present in the _LOCATION_ . this result is consistent with the _LOCATION_ localization of other components of the ga response pathway and suggests that _PROTEIN_ 's role as a negative regulator of ga signaling involves interaction with other _LOCATION_ proteins and/oro n acetyl _PROTEIN_ modification of these proteins .
two reporter genes that place the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ under the control of sequences from upstream of the start of _PROTEIN_ translation were constructed and used to characterize thespy promoter and its activity . the first exon ofspy is untranslated and by comparing the promoter activity of reporter genes that either contained _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or lacked _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ the complete first intron and exon sequences the role of these sequences in controlling _PROTEIN_ was tested . a map of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is shown in figure _PROTEIN_ was identical tospy _PROTEIN_ except that it does not contain thespy region to the xhoi site present in exon . no gus activity was detected in any transgenic plant containingspy _PROTEIN_ indicating that sequences in the first exon and/or intron are required for detectable levels of _PROTEIN_ . the pattern of gus _PROTEIN_ in plants carryingspy _PROTEIN_ matched the localization ofspy mrna as determined by in situ hybridization . for example both methods of detection revealedspy _PROTEIN_ throughout seedlings with more intense signal in the shoot apex and root tips . in addition _PROTEIN_ of thespy cdna under the control of the promoter used inspy _PROTEIN_ rescues spy mutants . therefore we believe that the pattern of gus _PROTEIN_ obtained with this construct reflects the _PROTEIN_ pattern of thespy gene and have further characterized _PROTEIN_ by determining the gus _PROTEIN_ pattern . eleven independent lines carrying _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in the no o background were identified . based on preliminary examination of the gus staining of the lines two representative lines and each containing a single transgene locus were selected for more detailed analysis . both lines gave the same results and data from line are shown in figure . in general gus activity was detected in all organs of the plant and at all stages of the life cycle however some developmental regulation was apparent . gus activity was detected d after germination in the radicle just before its emergence from the seed . at and d after germination _PROTEIN_ in the young seedling was highest in the cotyledons and the root tip . at and d _PROTEIN_ was also detectable in the hypocotyl . at d of age gus activity in the first pair of true leaves was reduced relative to the rest of the seedling . two days _PROTEIN_ this difference disappeared and the intensity of staining was again fairly similar throughout the aboveground portion of the plant with a higher staining intensity in the vegetative apex . this developmental regulation of gus activity was not detected in leaves developing at _PROTEIN_ nodes . older plants also displayed uniform gus staining throughout the vegetative organs but this staining was less intense . in older seedlings _PROTEIN_ was observed throughout the root particularly at the tip of the primary root and in _PROTEIN_ roots . gus staining was also observed in trichomes and senescing leaves and in inflorescence internodes flowers . _PROTEIN_ was observed in the seeds and carpels of fully elongated siliques . lower _PROTEIN_ was also observed in expanding siliques and in the developing seeds in these siliques when they were cut open to allow the gus substrate to penetrate . _PROTEIN_ was also detected in the embryo of maturing seeds when no o flowers were pollinated with pollen from line . to investigate possible transcriptional regulation ofspy various treatments and growth regulators were applied to and plants . plants were germinated on murashige and skoog plates without growth regulators and at d of age were transferred to new plates containing m naphthaline acetic acid mbenzyl amino purine or m abscisic acid . other plants were transferred to murashige and skoog plates and placed in the dark at or . control plants were transferred to fresh plates and kept at in the light . seedlings were stained for gus activity after h of treatment . no differences in gus staining were observed between control plants and plants receiving any of the treatments . because _PROTEIN_ is thought to be a negative regulator of ga signal transduction we also examined whether thespy _PROTEIN_ gene responded to _PROTEIN_ treatments . lines and in the no o background were analyzed by treating week old seedlings with either of _PROTEIN_ in of ethanol or of ethanol only . after h whole seedlings were stained for gus activity and ga treated seedlings were found to stain slightly more intensely than control plants particularly in the shoot apex . this experiment was repeated several times with similar results on each occasion . to quantify this difference gus activity in seedlings representing four independent lines in the no o background including and was quantified . although we observed a slight increase in gus activity in response to continuous growth in the presence of m _PROTEIN_ we were not able to repeat this result when the same _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was introduced in the columbia background . we were also unable to observe any effect of the gai and spy mutations onspy _PROTEIN_ activity in the columbia background . in conclusion the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ reporter gene suggests that _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ throughout the life of the plant and in most plant organs examined and there is at most only minor regulation at the transcriptional level by the treatments investigated . two approaches were used to determine the cellular localization of the _PROTEIN_ protein . in the first approach a construct _PROTEIN_ full length _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein under the control of thespy promoter was introduced into plants and the localization of _METHOD_ was determined . in the second approach _PROTEIN_ was detected on protein blots containing proteins from different subcellular fractions . before initiating experiments to localize the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein the functionality of the fusion protein was assessed by determining if _PROTEIN_ of this protein in spy seeds restored sensitivity to paclobutrazol a ga biosynthesis inhibitor . seeds from independently generatedspy lines carrying the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgene were scored for resistance to kanamycin the marker linked to thespy _METHOD_ transgene and resistance to paclobutrazol . in every line germination on paclobutrazol was reduced and the ratios of resistance to kanamycin sensitivity to kanamycin and sensitivity to paclobutrazol resistance to paclobutrazol seeds were similar indicating that thespy _METHOD_ transgene encodes a protein with _PROTEIN_ activity . the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgene encodes a protein with _PROTEIN_ activity the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgene is driven by the same promoter asspy _PROTEIN_ and the _PROTEIN_ pattern in roots where _METHOD_ was low enough for the protein to be easily detected was similar to the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ pattern . in root cells the majority of the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ is from the _LOCATION_ although some is also from the cytoplasm . in comparisons between plants carrying the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgene and untransformed controls the _METHOD_ from the _LOCATION_ of the transgenic plant was clearly stronger and distinguishable from that of the control indicating that the _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ of the transgenic plant was not attributable to _METHOD_ from the cell wall . in other parts of the plant _METHOD_ prevented _METHOD_ localization . examination of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ seedlings and min after treatment with or m aba did not detect any effect of these treatments on either the localization or abundance of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . we also failed to observe any change in _METHOD_ activity and h after transfer to murashige and skoog plates containing m paclobutrazol . we have found that _PROTEIN_ from arabidopsis plants is difficult to detect by western blot analysis presumably because it is rare . because immunolocalization experiments and the _PROTEIN_ pattern ofspy _PROTEIN_ suggested that _PROTEIN_ might be more abundant in apices we attempted to detect _PROTEIN_ from cauliflower inflorescences . a western blot containing total soluble cauliflower inflorescence proteins and a protein sample from arabidopsis seedlings in which _PROTEIN_ had been concentrated and enriched by precipitation with ammonium sulfate was probed with affinity purified anti _PROTEIN_ antibodies that recognize recombinant _PROTEIN_ protein _PROTEIN_ in bothescherichia coli and insect cells . a single protein of the expected size of _PROTEIN_ was detected in both samples suggesting that these antibodies recognize cauliflower _PROTEIN_ and that it is more abundant in the inflorescence of cauliflower than in arabidopsis plants . to confirm that _PROTEIN_ is localized to the _LOCATION_ duplicate western blots containing proteins from purified cauliflower _LOCATION_ and total soluble proteins were probed with antibodies against _PROTEIN_ histone and tubulin . consistent with the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ localization to the _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ was most abundant in the purified _LOCATION_ . the _LOCATION_ proteins do not react strongly with antitubulin antibodies indicating that the _LOCATION_ are not highly contaminated with _LOCATION_ proteins . _PROTEIN_ protein was also detected in the soluble protein fraction suggesting that _PROTEIN_ is also present in the _LOCATION_ . however this protein preparation also contained histones indicating that this fraction was contaminated with _LOCATION_ proteins . consequently we were not able to determine if _PROTEIN_ is also present in the _LOCATION_ of cauliflower cells . detailed examination of the phenotype of several spymutants has been used previously to examine the role of _PROTEIN_ in plant development . nevertheless it is likely that additional roles for _PROTEIN_ remain to be discovered especially because more recent work suggests that _PROTEIN_ may play a role in plant development beyond its role in ga signaling . because the _PROTEIN_ of a gene in a particular organ or developmental stage is consistent with a physiological role for the corresponding protein the pattern of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was compared with known roles for _PROTEIN_ . two aspects of _PROTEIN_ suggested possible new functions for _PROTEIN_ . in contrast to other leaves a change in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ during development was readily detectable in the first pair of true leaves . to test the hypothesis that _PROTEIN_ may have a unique role in these leaves the first pair of leaves was examined for defects in development . the distance across the first leaf pair ofspy plants was smaller than those of wild type confirming that _PROTEIN_ is essential for the normal development of these leaves but no additional defects in leaf development were detected . previous analysis of severespy mutants _PROTEIN_ in vegetative development revealed that they possess smaller rosettes than wt plants . therefore although _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ varies during the growth of the first leaf pair these leaves exhibited no phenotypes that are not observed in leaves where _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is constant throughout development . early leaf growth is altered in spy mutants the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ reporter constructs also reveal that _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ in roots . initial inspection of wt and spy mutant roots did not reveal any obvious differences in morphology or growth . to examine root development more carefully roots were allowed to grow along the surface of an agar plate inclined at an angle of about from the vertical . due to the nutation of the root as it elongates wt roots grew aslant of the vertical and the root also exhibited a wavy phenotype . because it has been reported that this phenotype is difficult to detect in the columbia background we used spy mutants in the wassilewskija and landsberg _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ backgrounds . as shown in figure spy roots behave very differently from wt ws roots under these conditions demonstrating that root growth is altered in the mutant plants . the wavy pattern was less pronounced in spy roots and the mean angle the roots deviated from the vertical was reversed and significantly different from wt . to confirm that this phenotype is due to loss of _PROTEIN_ function and not some previously unrecognized mutation in the spy plants the growth of spy was also examined and found to exhibit similar abnormal root growth . root waving is altered in the spy and gai mutants in an attempt to determine whether the altered angle of root growth ofspy mutants represents a physiological role for gas two experiments were performed . in the first experiment we were unable to mimic the spy phenotype by growing wt ws roots on plates containing . in the second experiment the effect of the gai mutation which reduces ga response was examined . when grown on plates solidified with agar no differences between wt la _LOCATION_ and gai were detected . however when plates solidified with agar were used instead gai roots grew at a slightly but significantly greater angle than wt la _LOCATION_ . on plates the difference between wt ws and spy was still apparent suggesting that spy and gai have opposite effects on this phenotype .
all seeds were stratified for d at under dim light to aid germination . all plants were grown under an h long day photoperiod of consisting of white _METHOD_ light with a temperature of and . for the root assays seeds were placed on the surface of murashige and skoog plates sealed with medical tape and stratified as usual . when transferred to a growth room the plates were placed at an angle of from the vertical with the seeds toward the light source and at the top of the plate . the majority of roots grew on the surface of the agar . roots that grew into the agar did not exhibit the root waving phenotype and were not measured . values are shown as the mean se and student 's t test was used to determine the statistical significance of differences between genotypes . to allow comparison of leaf size with wt columbia and spy the spy mutation originally generated by a t dna insertion in the ws background was backcrossed into the columbia genetic background six times . the gai lines were each backcrossed into the columbia genetic background three times before combining withspy _PROTEIN_ lines in the columbia background . upon request all novel materials described here will be

nucleotides from the end of exon so that the most nucleotide of this promoter corresponds to a position nucleotides upstream of the _PROTEIN_ start codon in exon _PROTEIN_ was identical tospy _PROTEIN_ except that the region of thespy gene of the xhoi site which cuts at position in exon was not included . an additional reporter gene _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ a full length
