the family _PROTEIN_ binding module of the arabidopsis starch phosphorylator _PROTEIN_ water dikinase _PROTEIN_ was heterologously produced and its properties were compared to the from a fungal _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ has fold lower affinity for cyclodextrins than that from ga. homology modelling identified possible structural elements responsible for this weak binding of the intracellular . differential binding of fluorescein labelled _PROTEIN_ and ga modules to starch granules in vitro was demonstrated by confocal laser scanning microscopy and yellow _METHOD_ protein tagged _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in tobacco confirmed binding to starch granules in planta .
the sequence of a. thaliana has similarity to a. niger ga sbd compared to similarity with a putative _PROTEIN_ sbd from oryza sativa . tryptophans at _PROTEIN_ sbd putative binding site are conserved as are and . the _PROTEIN_ sbd model exhibited a similar fold as ga sbd with seven strands distributed in two sheets and ligand binding site was readily identified . only and are conserved in _PROTEIN_ sbd from site containing and in ga sbd . noticeably _PROTEIN_ sbd has a residue deletion in the third flexible ga sbd loop including that is strongly involved in binding at site . the _PROTEIN_ sbd model illustrated this structural difference presumably affecting the binding . a _PROTEIN_ sbd construct containing residues was the most stable one among those tested . the purified module had an apparent molecular weight in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ consistent with the calculated kda . nonetheless the stability of _PROTEIN_ sbd was lower than that of ga sbd . stability was lower after re purification for efficient removal of cd indicative of ligand stabilisation . it is also possible that interactions with the catalytic _PROTEIN_ domain provide stability to sbd when present in the native enzyme . differential affinity of _PROTEIN_ sbd and ga sbd towards and cd was demonstrated using spr _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ sbd showed strongest binding towards cd and no detectable affinity for linear maltooligosaccharides or for phosphorylated cd . the cd affinity minimum was at neutral ph . _PROTEIN_ sbd _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in pichia pastoris and as a glutathione s transferase _PROTEIN_ fusion in escherischia coli gave similar k d values for cd at ph excluding artefacts due to _PROTEIN_ host or affinity tag . the optimum affinity for cd of a. niger ga is at ph and comparison at the _PROTEIN_ sbd optimum ph showed affinity fold higher for ga than for _PROTEIN_ sbd _PROTEIN_ consistent with ga uv difference spectroscopy and nmr titration . affinity differences between the two ga sbd sites assessed for the mutants and are reflected in k d of and respectively . this agrees with k of and k of obtained by fitting a two binding site model to our ga sbd spr data . the fold higher k d for cd _PROTEIN_ clearly identifies _PROTEIN_ sbd as a low affinity sbd compared to ga sbd . the physiological relevance and generality is substantiated by the plant in _PROTEIN_ and in starch synthase iii both having low affinity . as for _PROTEIN_ these enzymes are predominantly found in soluble form when extracted . furthermore _PROTEIN_ binding to starch in planta is stronger in the dark as a possible effect of the redox potential in stroma . however _PROTEIN_ does not possess the suggested cfatc redox motif found in _PROTEIN_ and might not be redox regulated . the slightly lower affinity found at ph as compared to ph may suggest slightly stronger binding during the day when stromal ph increases indicating differential dynamics of binding for the _PROTEIN_ sbd in response to physiological needs . _PROTEIN_ visualised binding of fluorescein labelled _PROTEIN_ sbd to starch granules including normal and waxy barley and maize endosperm starch and normal potato tuber starch . clear _METHOD_ was detected at the granule surface and in channels characteristic of maize starches . the sites of label in the starch granules indicate identical binding sites for the two sbds . however some subtle differences in binding distribution to specific starches were observed . while both sbds interacted internally with the waxy granules they showed more discrete surface binding to normal cereal granules . the potato starch showed least penetration . for the maize granules the label for the ga sbd had higher contrast than the _PROTEIN_ sbd indicating a tendency for more distinct surface localisation for ga sbd than for _PROTEIN_ sbd suggesting that _PROTEIN_ sbd more efficiently penetrates these granules . fluorescein labelled bovine serum albumin gave no starch granule _METHOD_ and free dye penetrated the granules and resulted in unspecific binding . in vivo a _PROTEIN_ sbd _METHOD_ fusion demonstrated affinity for starch granules by transient _PROTEIN_ in tobacco leaves . _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was localised in the chloroplasts _METHOD_ and was essentially confined to the starch granules .
a. niger ga sbd was used as template to generate a _PROTEIN_ sbd homology model using modeller . _PROTEIN_ sbd residues lacking in the template were deleted from the model . sequences were aligned using clustalw . _PROTEIN_ sbd was cloned from full length _PROTEIN_ cdna into ncoi and xhoi sites of pet using sense aacatg ccatgg cagatggatcaggaacgaaagtg and antisense primer aaccg ctcgaga ccaacatcatcatcattaccaac and standard molecular biology procedures . escherichia coli harbouring the _PROTEIN_ sbd construct was grown at to od . _PROTEIN_ was induced by adding isopropyl d thiogalactopyranoside to followed by incubation at for h. after cell harvest sonication and centrifugation the extract was passed over a ml his trap column . the _PROTEIN_ sbd was eluted as recommended by the manufacturer applied to a ml cyclodextrin sepharose column and eluted with mm cd . cd traces were removed by an additional his trap purification and desalting using ml zeba desalt spin columns . final yield was mg/l culture . a. niger recombinant ga sbd was produced as described . surface plasmon resonance _METHOD_ were recorded of binding mm cd linear maltooligosaccharides and cd with phosphate groups to biotinylated protein _PROTEIN_ . k d values were calculated by steady state affinity fitting to the response after subtracting the reference cell signal . fluorescein ex succinimidyl ester in fold molar excess was reacted with _PROTEIN_ sbd _PROTEIN_ for h at . fluorescein conjugated protein was his trap purified desalted twice and protein was incubated with starch granules for min at with gentle rotation . visualisation by _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ used fluorescein excitation at nm and recorded emission at nm with laser power and the gain varied to prevent saturation of the detector and to ensure comparable intensities . the objective used was hcx pl apo w _PROTEIN_ uv . image analysis was performed by the tcs software . the region encoding residues of _PROTEIN_ containing the chloroplast transit peptide and sbd was amplified using uracil containing primers and fused to _METHOD_ . the fusion protein was transiently _PROTEIN_ in nicotiana benthamiana and analysed in situ by _PROTEIN_ .
