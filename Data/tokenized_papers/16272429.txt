the arabidopsis thaliana protein nitric oxide _PROTEIN_ is needed for nitric oxide synthesis and signaling during defense responses hormonal signaling and flowering . the cellular localization of _PROTEIN_ was examined because it is predicted to be a mitochondrial protein . _PROTEIN_ green _METHOD_ protein fusions were localized by confocal microscopy to mitochondria in roots . isolated mitochondria from leaves of wild type plants supported arg stimulated no synthesis that could be inhibited by nos inhibitors and quenched by a no scavenger this nos activity is absent in mitochondria isolated from _PROTEIN_ mutant plants . because mitochondria are a source of reactive oxygen species which participate in senescence and programmed cell death these parameters were examined in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . dark induced senescence of detached leaves and intact plants progressed more rapidly in the mutant compared with the wild type . hydrogen peroxide superoxide anion oxidized lipid and oxidized protein levels were all higher in the mutant . these results demonstrate that _PROTEIN_ is a mitochondrial nos that reduces ros levels mitigates oxidative damage and acts as an antisenescence agent .
computational analysis of the _PROTEIN_ protein sequence revealed that _PROTEIN_ has a high probability of being targeted to the mitochondria _PROTEIN_ . to test this prediction transgenic arabidopsis plants were generated that carried a green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ reporter fused in frame to the c terminus of the _PROTEIN_ coding region driven by a promoter . seedlings were grown vertically on agarose plates and then roots of d old transgenic plants were examined by confocal microscopy for _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . strong _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was observed in a punctate pattern in the mature part of roots and in root hairs indicating that the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein was localized to an organelle . to determine whether these sites of _METHOD_ accumulation are mitochondria the pattern of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was compared with that from mitotracker red a mitochondria specific stain . _METHOD_ signals from _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ colocalized with those from mitotracker in root hairs . these results indicate that _PROTEIN_ is targeted to the mitochondria . these findings led us to test the role of _PROTEIN_ in arg dependent no synthesis in mitochondria . the no reactive dye amino methylamino difluorofluorescein diacetate _PROTEIN_ was used to detect no production by mitochondria . a similar approach has been used in animal cells using the related _PROTEIN_ dye diaminofluorescein diacetate . in intact mammalian cells part of the overall no dependent _METHOD_ colocalized with a subpopulation of mitochondria that stained with mitotracker red . in our study no production was assayed in isolated mitochondria from leaves of wild type and _PROTEIN_ mutant plants . the mitochondrial preparation showed a punctate pattern of _PROTEIN_ fm _METHOD_ without the addition of any substrate . when simultaneously stained with mitotracker the majority of strong _PROTEIN_ fm signals could be seen to overlap with the mitotracker signal indicating that most of the strong _PROTEIN_ fm _METHOD_ could be assigned to mitochondria . next the effect of the substrate arg and various inhibitors on no synthesis was examined . preincubating the mitochondrial preparation with mm arg significantly increased the level of _PROTEIN_ fm _METHOD_ . this strong _METHOD_ overlapped with mitotracker _METHOD_ indicating that the _PROTEIN_ fm _METHOD_ was from mitochondria . increased _PROTEIN_ fm _METHOD_ was not observed with mm citrulline and was severely inhibited by _PROTEIN_ tetramethyl imidazoline oxyl oxide a no scavenger and by mm l _PROTEIN_ or l nmma two mammalian nos inhibitors . the amount of _METHOD_ was quantified and is shown in figure . these results indicate that mitochondria purified from arabidopsis leaves support arg dependent no synthesis . these experiments allowed us to determine whether _PROTEIN_ is required for no synthesis in mitochondria . arg stimulated no synthesis was examined in mitochondria prepared from _PROTEIN_ mutant plants . the results showed that arg has little effect on _PROTEIN_ fm _METHOD_ in _PROTEIN_ mitochondria compared with the untreated control . the level of _METHOD_ for _PROTEIN_ mitochondria in the presence or absence of arg is approximately the same as for wild type mitochondria in the absence of arg . in addition the mitotracker _METHOD_ from _PROTEIN_ mitochondria was approximately the same as for wild type mitochondria indicating that both preparations had an equivalent concentration of intact mitochondria . we conclude that _PROTEIN_ is a mtnos required for arg dependent no production in mitochondria of plant cells . leaf senescence is a developmentally controlled degenerative process induced by exogenous signals such as light and water deficits and regulated by endogenous _PROTEIN_ such as ethylene and cytokinin . no has been implicated as an antisenescence signal in that no treatments extend the postharvest life of fruits and vegetables and reverse the loss of protein in abscisic acid methyl jasmonate and treated rice . also no levels are downregulated during the natural senescence of pea leaves and are negatively correlated with ethylene levels . we investigated the role of _PROTEIN_ in leaf senescence . senescence was induced by dark treatment of detached leaves a procedure that is commonly used to artificially induce senescence . under these conditions _PROTEIN_ mutant leaves senesce more rapidly than do wild type leaves . individual leaves from wild type plants became pale green after to d of dark treatment whereas leaves from the _PROTEIN_ mutant showed severe yellowing and cell death . measurements of chlorophyll content showed that chlorophyll was lost more quickly in _PROTEIN_ mutant leaves diminishing by after d and by after d whereas wild type leaves lost and of their chlorophyll after and d respectively . treatment of the _PROTEIN_ mutant leaves with the no donor sodium nitroprusside slowed dark induced senescence and chlorophyll loss . examination of cell viability showed that cell death was significantly higher in the _PROTEIN_ mutant as measured by evans blue staining . evans blue measures cell death for an entire leaf . trypan blue staining also showed higher rates of cell death in _PROTEIN_ occurring as isolated dead cells in the mutant after d of dark treatment . these results indicate that _PROTEIN_ protects plants from dark induced senescence and that the accelerated senescence of _PROTEIN_ leaves results from no deficiency because exogenous addition of no can reverse the phenotype . we next examined senescence of intact plants . dark induced leaf senescence occurs more slowly in intact arabidopsis plants relative to detached leaves . upon dark treatment for d no increase in yellowing was observed in both wild type and mutant plants although leaves began to lose pigment . after dark treatment for d some older leaves of the mutant plants showed increased yellowing and collapse of leaf structure whereas wild type plants were still pale green with no visible yellowing . at day almost all of the older leaves were yellow and collapsed in the mutant whereas only some of the older wild type leaves showed yellowing and collapse . when chlorophyll levels were examined mutant plants showed a more rapid loss of chlorophyll than wild type plants especially on days and . in leaves from the mutant chlorophyll levels _PROTEIN_ by on day and by on day whereas the levels in wild type leaves were reduced by only on day and by on day . after d of dark treatment wild type and mutant plants were returned to light conditions for d. approximately of wild type plants recovered whereas only of the mutants survived . these results indicate that _PROTEIN_ affects senescence and dark recovery rates of both detached and attached leaves . they also provide genetic evidence that no is an endogenous regulator of plant leaf senescence . senescence involves ros and oxidative reactions that result in increases in lipid peroxidation . no is known to interact with ros especially during pcd affecting the extent of ros accumulation and cell death . in cell culture and during hypersensitive responses no works synergistically with to induce cell death . during senescence however no appears to work as an antioxidant and slows degeneration . in rice application of no donors counteracts abscisic acid and methyl jasmonate induced leaf senescence and reduces accumulation . to determine what effect _PROTEIN_ has on ros accumulation young seedlings and detached leaves of wild type and _PROTEIN_ plants were examined . endogenous and levels were monitored with diaminobenzidine and nitroblue tetrazolium staining respectively . we also examined levels during dark induced senescence in leaves of wild type and mutant plants . basal levels were higher in young _PROTEIN_ seedlings compared with wild type seedlings when grown in peat soil under long day conditions . the accumulated most intensely at the outer perimeter of older leaves . likewise higher levels of were observed in detached leaves harvested from week old _PROTEIN_ plants . when leaves were dark treated to induce senescence accumulated more rapidly in _PROTEIN_ mutant leaves compared with wild type leaves . levels were also higher in detached leaves from mutant plants compared with wild type leaves at day but in contrast with no distinct accumulation of was found in wild type and _PROTEIN_ leaves during dark induced senescence . these results indicate that _PROTEIN_ suppresses and accumulation in leaves of young plants and accumulation during dark induced senescence . the higher levels of ros in mutant plants led us to examine oxidative damage in the form of protein and lipid oxidation . total soluble proteins from leaves were analyzed by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . as a control the protein gels were stained with _METHOD_ blue and they showed that proteins appeared more degraded in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . after d of dark treatment protein degradation in the mutant was even more apparent . this loss of intact protein in the mutant corresponded to the maximal accumulation at day of dark treatment . we then examined the extent of protein oxidation by measuring _PROTEIN_ levels a marker of protein oxidation . the _PROTEIN_ mutant leaves had much higher levels of oxidized proteins than did wild type leaves before dark treatment . after dark treatment levels of oxidized protein in the wild type increased slightly after d then _PROTEIN_ to undetectable levels at day . in _PROTEIN_ levels of oxidized protein _PROTEIN_ dramatically after d of dark treatment then disappeared by day . measurements of lipid peroxidation revealed that the _PROTEIN_ mutant had a higher level of mda than the wild type before dark treatment . these levels did not increase significantly during the d of dark treatment whereas the levels of mda in wild type leaves were initially lower _PROTEIN_ and increased somewhat during d of dark treatment but remained lower relative to _PROTEIN_ .
