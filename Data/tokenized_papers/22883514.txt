in eukaryotes dolichols play indispensable roles as glycosyl carrier lipids in the biosynthesis of glycoproteins on _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . in addition to dolichols seed plants have other types of z polyisoprenoids termed ficaprenol and betulaprenol in abundance . however the physiological significance of these polyprenols has not been elucidated because of limited information _PROTEIN_ which catalyze the formation of the structural backbone of z polyisoprenoids . in the comprehensive identification and characterization of cpt homologues from arabidopsis thaliana _PROTEIN_ was identified as a novel cis heptaprenyl diphosphate synthase . _PROTEIN_ heterologously _PROTEIN_ in escherichia coli catalyzed the formation of polyisoprenoid as a major product independent of the chain lengths of allylic primer substrates . kinetic analyses revealed that farnesyl diphosphate was the most favorable for _PROTEIN_ among the allylic substrates tested suggesting that _PROTEIN_ was responsible for the formation of betulaprenol . _PROTEIN_ partially suppressed the phenotypes of a yeast cpt mutant deficient in the biosynthesis of dolichols . moreover in a. thaliana cells subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ on the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ was shown by using green _METHOD_ protein fused proteins . however a _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ suggested that _PROTEIN_ and its product might function in response to abiotic stresses rather than in cell _PROTEIN_ as a glycosyl carrier lipid on the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ .
in order to analyze the prenyltransferase activity coding cdna of _PROTEIN_ fused with glutathione _PROTEIN_ was overexpressed in e. coli and then each lysate was centrifuged to obtain soluble and insoluble fractions . the prenyltransferase assay was carried out with and e _METHOD_ as substrates and the chain length of the products was analyzed by reversed phase tlc . for both soluble and insoluble fractions from e. coli overexpressing _PROTEIN_ additional prenyl products with _PROTEIN_ chain lengths ranging from _PROTEIN_ to were detected in which prenyl products were the major product by comparison with products from the endogenous activity in the control strain transformed with the empty vector . to characterize _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in eukaryotic cells cpt assays were conducted with crude proteins from s. cerevisiae _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in which a mutant strain of one cpt gene citation was applied as a host . this system has been utilized to analyze reaction products from an exogenous cpt citation citation citation because the activity of the other yeast cpt _PROTEIN_ which produces polyisoprenoids citation is too low to detect until the stationary phase of cell growth . as shown in fig . the crude proteins prepared from a strain for synthesized polyprenyl products ranging in chain length from to whereas corresponding polyprenyl products were not detected in the reaction products of . consistent with the results from the recombinant _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in e. coli crude proteins from showed distinct activities producing polyisoprenoid . in addition detectable amounts of radiolabeled products migrated at the position corresponding to polyprenols were also observed in the assay with the _PROTEIN_ overexpressing strain . to investigate the possibility of conversion of prenyl diphosphate from _PROTEIN_ into these additional radiolabeled compounds by the action of enzymes in yeast the prenyl diphosphates prepared by using the recombinant _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in e. coli were incubated with the crude extracts from . reaction products were extracted with dephosphorylated and then analyzed by reversed phase tlc . as a consequence no significant conversion in the radioactive compounds was caused by incubation with the crude extracts from yeast . therefore these additional products observed in the reaction with the crude extracts from were considered to be formed by the prenyl chain elongation reaction of _PROTEIN_ . these results revealed that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in yeast showed a activity producing and prenyl products although the major product of the recombinant _PROTEIN_ was polyisoprenoid independent of the host species tested . hence _PROTEIN_ was renamed a. thaliana z synthase _PROTEIN_ . to investigate the precise enzymatic properties of _PROTEIN_ the recombinant protein was purified from e. coli overexpressing _PROTEIN_ . our first attempt to purify _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ by using affinity chromatography from the soluble fraction of e. coli was unsuccessful because of the low _PROTEIN_ level of _PROTEIN_ as a soluble protein . solubility of the protein in the e. coli _PROTEIN_ system was improved by the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ as a fusion protein with a chaperone protein trigger _PROTEIN_ and under the control of a promoter . the kda protein corresponding to _PROTEIN_ fused with the tag proteins was purified from the soluble fraction of the crude extracts by using chromatography to . then the tag protein was cleaved by treatment with thrombin . however it was difficult to dissociate the kda _PROTEIN_ protein from the kda tag fragment completely under conditions because of the strong hydrophobic interaction of the tf . therefore the partially purified _PROTEIN_ containing the cleaved tag fragments was utilized for further characterization . since triton is known to be required for cpt activity for _PROTEIN_ from e. coli and m. luteus citation citation the effect of various detergents on the cpt activity of _PROTEIN_ was analyzed . in order to determine which type of detergent was necessary for cpt activity varying concentrations of triton as a detergent cetyl trimethylammonium bromide as a cationic detergent and sodium deoxycholate as an anionic detergent were tested . the cpt activity was increased significantly in the presence of triton in a manner until which corresponds to a critical micelle concentration . in contrast the cpt activity was inhibited drastically in the presence of ctab and doc in a manner until each corresponding cmc mm and mm respectively . these results indicated that _PROTEIN_ required a detergent until its cmc but interaction with ionic agents was not favorable . however the requirement was not strict as of the activity remained in the absence of detergents . divalent cations such as have also been reported to be essential for the _PROTEIN_ reaction citation citation . in order to assess the requirement of _PROTEIN_ for divalent cations the concentration dependence of was analyzed . although the cpt activity was quite low in the absence of it increased drastically with the addition of with a maximum at mm . in the presence of other divalent cations and the activity was weak . structural differences between ficaprenols and betulaprenols in plants suggests the presence of two types of cpts that prefer either e e or e _METHOD_ as substrates respectively . to investigate the allylic substrate specificity of _PROTEIN_ the kinetic parameters for ipp and various allylic diphosphates dmapp gpp e _METHOD_ e e and z e diphosphate were determined by nonlinear regression analysis . _PROTEIN_ exhibited lower km values for e _METHOD_ and e e and higher kcat values for e _METHOD_ and z e . among the allylic substrates tested only dmapp was not acceptable for _PROTEIN_ . thus e _METHOD_ was the optimal allylic substrate and e e was also adequate for _PROTEIN_ judging from the kcat/km values . _PROTEIN_ exhibited a higher km value for ipp compared with the allylic substrates probably because of the sequential condensations . the product analysis with each allylic substrate by reversed phase tlc revealed that the major products of _PROTEIN_ were z hexaprenyl diphosphate z and z octaprenyl diphosphate . notably z was the predominant product which was independent of the chain length of allylic substrates tested . in conclusion _PROTEIN_ has been identified as a novel z synthase in seed plants and may be responsible for the synthesis of betulaprenols . to elucidate the enzymatic function of the z synthase _PROTEIN_ in vivo functional complementation of the cpt mutant of s. cerevisiae by the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ was conducted . the mutant strain containing a mutation in a yeast cpt displays some phenotypes caused by dolichol deficiency such as slow and growth and defects in protein glycosylation citation . as indicated in fig . the mutant strain had slow growth at compared with the wt strain and hardly grew at . _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ could partially suppress the slow growth phenotype under the permissive temperature of and the phenotype under the restricted temperature of . these results suggested that _PROTEIN_ could act as a cpt instead of in vivo and their products could function as a precursor of glycosyl carrier lipid in s. cerevisiae . because localizes in the _LOCATION_ citation _PROTEIN_ was also expected to localize in the _LOCATION_ . subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ in plant cells was analyzed by the _METHOD_ imaging of _PROTEIN_ fused with synthetic green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ citation _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis cultured cells citation . in the _METHOD_ cells the _METHOD_ signal was observed in the _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ which was a typical pattern of _METHOD_ localization while the _METHOD_ of _METHOD_ was observed as a network pattern which was similar to a typical pattern of some _LOCATION_ proteins . subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ on the _LOCATION_ was also suggested by the specific detection of _METHOD_ in the microsomal fraction extracted from the cells by western blotting using a _METHOD_ antibody . to confirm the localization of _PROTEIN_ on the _LOCATION_ mcherry a red _METHOD_ protein fused to an _LOCATION_ signal peptide and a _LOCATION_ signal hdel was with _METHOD_ in the cells . in contrast to the chlorophyll _METHOD_ observed in _METHOD_ cells the red _METHOD_ emitted from in the cells showed a typical _LOCATION_ network pattern . superimposition of the _METHOD_ images revealed that the green _METHOD_ signal from _METHOD_ was mostly with red _METHOD_ signal from . these results indicated that _PROTEIN_ functioned in the _LOCATION_ of arabidopsis cells . thus detection of the activity of the recombinant _PROTEIN_ in both _LOCATION_ and soluble fractions of e. coli and yeast may show mislocalization of the protein in a heterologous _PROTEIN_ system . although the physiological significance of betulaprenols has not yet been elucidated betulaprenols in silver birch are supposed to provide the trunk with mechanical resistance against breaks in cold climates citation . to investigate the involvement of _PROTEIN_ in response to such environmental stimuli in a. thaliana the detailed _PROTEIN_ pattern of _PROTEIN_ in root tissues under cold stress and aba treatments was investigated because _PROTEIN_ was shown to be predominantly _PROTEIN_ in roots . the _PROTEIN_ level of _PROTEIN_ oscillated slightly under the light conditions . after the aba treatment _PROTEIN_ was induced rapidly within h and then _PROTEIN_ to basal levels . in contrast _PROTEIN_ was induced by cold treatment in a manner until h after the treatment was initiated where the magnitude of the induction was higher than that by the aba treatment . these results strongly suggest that _PROTEIN_ and its products may have a role in response to cold stress in root .
