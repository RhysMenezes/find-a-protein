in eukaryotes histone acetyltransferases regulate the acetylation of histones and transcription _PROTEIN_ affecting chromatin structural organization transcriptional regulation and gene activation . to assess the role of _PROTEIN_ a gene encoding for a histone acetyltransferase in medicago truncatula stable transgenic lines with modified _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in the model plants m. truncatula lotus japonicus and arabidopsis thaliana were generated by agrobacterium mediated transformation and used for functional analyses . histochemical transcriptional flow cytometric and morphological analyses demonstrated the involvement of _PROTEIN_ in plant growth and development responses to internal stimuli and cell cycle progression . _PROTEIN_ patterns of a reporter gene encoding beta _PROTEIN_ fused to the _PROTEIN_ promoter sequence were associated with young tissues comprised of actively dividing cells in different plant organs . the green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ signal driven by the _PROTEIN_ promoter was detected in the _LOCATION_ and cytoplasm of root cells . transgenic lines with _PROTEIN_ overexpression and knockdown showed a wide range of phenotypic deviations and developmental abnormalities which provided lines of evidence for the role of _PROTEIN_ in plant development . synchronization of a. thaliana root tips in a line with _PROTEIN_ knockdown showed the involvement of this gene in the acetylation of two core histones during s phase of the plant cell cycle .
generation of stable transgenic plants from the three model species m. truncatula l. japonicus and a. thaliana was of crucial importance in elucidation of _PROTEIN_ function and tissue localization . after genetic transformation of wild type m. truncatula and l. japonicus stable lines were obtained and verified by pcr for the presence of the selectable marker gene . three to five independent transgenic lines with modified _PROTEIN_ levels of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ promoter reporters were used for all further analyses . five independent transgenic lines were selected for phenotypic characterization . to facilitate selection of transgenic plants the seeds produced from the primary transformants of a. thaliana were sown on selective medium with mg/l km . in the homozygous plants _PROTEIN_ transcript levels were evaluated and three to five independent lines selected for further analyses . _PROTEIN_ analysis of day old seedlings of oe m. truncatula lines displayed enhanced transcript levels of _PROTEIN_ . in oe and oe _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ was increased from to times while in oe _PROTEIN_ transcripts increased about times . in all knockdown plants _PROTEIN_ transcript abundance was lower as compared to the wild type . the _PROTEIN_ level of _PROTEIN_ in day old plants with overexpression and downregulation grown in a hydroponic system did not change significantly with age . the _PROTEIN_ transcripts in the nodules of oe and rnai lines showed higher levels in the oe line of m. truncatula and lower abundance in the knockdown line compared to control . evaluation of the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in day old seedlings of oe and rnai lines of l. japonicus showed higher transcript levels in the oe line and reduced levels in all knockdown lines . the transcript level in day old leaves and _METHOD_ of the oe and rnai lines grown as hydroponic cultures remained unchanged . in l. japonicus the _PROTEIN_ transcript level in nodules from the oe line was significantly higher than the transcript level in leaves and _METHOD_ and twice higher than the level in nodules from the m. truncatula oe line . approximately times lower transcript abundance was detected in the nodules of the knockdown line compared to the oe line and times lower compared to the wild type control . _PROTEIN_ was heterologously overexpressed in a. thaliana and monitoring the transcript abundance in three homozygous lines oe oe and oe showed three times higher _PROTEIN_ than in the control . endogenous level of _PROTEIN_ transcripts in the three rnai lines rnai rnai and rnai was also evaluated . only line rnai showed reduced transcript levels . transcriptional reporters of the three model species m. truncatula l. japonicus and a. thaliana allowed detection of _PROTEIN_ localization in different plant tissues and organs . in plants of m. truncatula gus _PROTEIN_ was detected at different stages of somatic embryogenesis globule torpedo and cotyledon in nodes and young internodes regions and also at the base of the petiole and vascular system of primary root . in l. japonicus gus _PROTEIN_ was observed in stem nodes leaf bases young petioles and nodule vasculature . _PROTEIN_ of gus reporter gene in a. thaliana plants was seen in stem nodes _PROTEIN_ vascular tissue and on the top of the stamen stalk . confocal microscopy observations revealed _METHOD_ _METHOD_ in the _LOCATION_ and cytoplasm of root cells and in trichome _LOCATION_ and root meristem of a. thaliana . _METHOD_ activity was also detected in the roots and nodules of l. japonicus . the function of _PROTEIN_ gene was studied by assessment of morphological parameters of truncatula oe and rnai lines grown either in vitro in vivo or as hydroponic cultures .

of in vitro rnai lines were similar to the control roots but _PROTEIN_ . in vitro rnai lines had a dwarf phenotype with shortened and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ roots covered with long root hairs and small leaves covered with many trichomes . truncatula oe lines grown in greenhouse conditions had a large well developed aerial part and more extensively branched _METHOD_ compared to the control . hydroponically grown plants showed highly branched root system with a pronounced spindle shape and a higher number of small nodules as compared to the wild type . m. truncatula rnai lines grown in greenhouse conditions possessed shorter aerial part with small leaves . most of the flowers turned black and fell off some plants were able to form small pods . hydroponically grown plants formed nodules in the upper part of the root system that was considerably less branched . in vitro oe lines of l. japonicus possessed short branched _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ roots which was opposite to the unbranched _METHOD_ and long thin roots in wild type plants . hydroponically grown oe lines of l. japonicus had large size nodules usually located in the upper part of the root system while the control plants formed smaller and dispersed nodules . downregulation of _PROTEIN_ resulted in plants with smaller leaves and nodules located in the middle part of the root . a reduced nodule number was noticed in both l. japonicus oe and rnai lines as compared to the control plants . to examine homozygous a. thaliana oe and rnai lines morphometric analyses were done and the following parameters quantified root growth dynamics width and length of the leaf blade petiole length and silique length and width . statistical analyses of root growth dynamics showed higher root growth rate of oe line at h and h compared to the wild type . in contrast the rnai line showed reduced primary root length at h and h as compared to the control . the oe line possessed significantly smaller leaf blade width and length and petiole length compared to the wild type . in contrast in the rnai line the same parameters were very similar to those of the wild type . the silique length of the oe line was similar to the wild type while the silique width was significantly reduced . in the rnai line the silique length and width were significantly increased as compared to the control . microscopic analyses of leaf epidermis of a. thaliana with modified _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ showed that rnai produced bigger leaves with larger epidermal cells and a _PROTEIN_ epidermal cell number compared to the wild type and oe line . on the other hand oe line formed smaller leaves with an increased epidermal cell number compared to the wild type and rnai line . in mature first leaves dna ploidy levels were assessed by flow cytometric measurements . line rnai formed leaves with a significant increase in and cells as compared to line oe . the ploidy level was between and times higher than in wild type leaves . this observation correlated well with the larger epidermal cell size detected by microscopic observations . in oe the ploidy distribution was similar to the control with the only exception of almost doubled number of cells with _LOCATION_ . a. thaliana root tips from seedlings of oe rnai and wild type were synchronized by treatment with mm hu . after h of synchronization corresponding to s phase root tips were harvested . transcript levels of the s phase marker gene and two core histones _PROTEIN_ and were evaluated by qrt pcr . in _PROTEIN_ knockdown line a higher accumulation of _PROTEIN_ and transcripts was detected as _PROTEIN_ showed more distinct increase . in the oe line transcript levels of the tested genes were equal to the control which imply that _PROTEIN_ is probably involved in acetylation of histones _PROTEIN_ and . we also tested whether the acetyltransferase inhibitor curcumin is effective in plant cells . l. japonicus oe and wild type seedlings were treated with curcumin at a concentration of and for and h. _PROTEIN_ analyses of collected root tips displayed that the transcript level of _PROTEIN_ in wild type root meristem was reduced after treatment with curcumin at time points and h. on the other hand in the oe line _PROTEIN_ transcript level was also reduced but showed the same values at the two time points analyzed . in order to test if the homeotic genes _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ could be possible targets of _PROTEIN_ we evaluated their transcript levels in the flowers of a. thaliana transgenic and wild type plants . results showed higher levels of _PROTEIN_ transcripts in the flowers of oe line as compared to wild type plants . in the flowers of the knockdown rnai line the transcript level of _PROTEIN_ was considerably lower than in the control and oe line . the transcript level of _PROTEIN_ was similar to the control . deviations in flower morphology such as the number and shape of _PROTEIN_ were observed in knockdown plants of the line rnai grown in greenhouse conditions compared to control flowers .
