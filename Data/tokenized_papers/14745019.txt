it is not known how plants synthesize the p aminobenzoate _PROTEIN_ moiety of folates . in escherichia coli _PROTEIN_ is made from _PROTEIN_ in two steps . first the paba and pabb proteins interact to catalyze transfer of the amide nitrogen of glutamine to _PROTEIN_ forming amino deoxychorismate . the pabc protein then mediates elimination of pyruvate and aromatization to give _PROTEIN_ . fungi actinomycetes and plasmodium spp . also synthesize _PROTEIN_ but have proteins comprising fused domains homologous to paba and pabb . these bipartite proteins are commonly called _PROTEIN_ synthases although it is unclear whether they produce _PROTEIN_ or adc . genomic approaches identified arabidopsis and tomato cdnas encoding bipartite proteins containing fused paba and pabb domains plus a putative chloroplast targeting peptide . these cdnas encode functional enzymes as demonstrated by complementation of an e. coli paba pabb double mutant and a yeast _PROTEIN_ synthase deletant . the partially purified recombinant arabidopsis protein did not produce _PROTEIN_ unless the e. coli pabc enzyme was added indicating that it _METHOD_ adc not _PROTEIN_ . the enzyme behaved as a monomer in size exclusion chromatography and was not inhibited by physiological concentrations of _PROTEIN_ its _PROTEIN_ ester or folates . when the putative targeting peptide was fused to _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ in protoplasts the fusion protein appeared only in chloroplasts indicating that _PROTEIN_ synthesis is _LOCATION_ . in the pericarp of tomato fruit the paba pabb mrna level fell drastically as ripening advanced but there was no fall in total _PROTEIN_ content which stayed between and fresh weight .
plants have genes specifying paba pabb hybrid proteins . blast searches of genbank and tigr databases with the protein sequences of e. coli paba and pabb detected a single arabidopsis gene and a cognate cdna encoding a kda polypeptide with paba and pabb like domains . truncated tomato _PROTEIN_ sequence tags specifying a similar protein were also found _PROTEIN_ was used to obtain the missing sequence and complete tomato cdnas encoding a kda protein were then isolated by rt pcr . the deduced arabidopsis protein is shown in fig ref and is aligned with its tomato counterpart in fig . which is published as supporting information on the pnas web site . both plant proteins comprise tandem domains that share identity with e. coli paba and pabb and identity with yeast _PROTEIN_ synthase . the plant proteins share overall identity with each other . as in yeast and other _PROTEIN_ synthases the paba and pabb domains of the plant proteins are separated by a long linker whose sequence is not conserved but is rich in basic amino acids . in contrast to yeast _PROTEIN_ synthase the plant proteins have a residue insertion near the end of the paba domain . like the interdomain linker this extra sequence is not conserved between arabidopsis and tomato but is basic in character . the plant proteins also have nonconserved n terminal extensions of residues that display the features of chloroplast targeting peptides . plant paba pabb cdnas complement e. coli and yeast _PROTEIN_ synthesis mutants . to determine whether the arabidopsis and tomato cdnas encode functional enzymes the sequences predicted to specify the mature proteins were cloned into e. coli _PROTEIN_ vector and yeast _PROTEIN_ vector u. allows tightly iptg controlled gene _PROTEIN_ in diverse host strains . the resulting constructs were transformed into an e. coli paba pabb double mutant and a yeast _PROTEIN_ synthase deletant both of which are _PROTEIN_ auxotrophs . the arabidopsis and tomato constructs yielded _PROTEIN_ independent transformants of the e. coli and yeast mutants with high frequency and their growth was similar to that of wild type strains . no complementation was seen with vectors alone . in e. coli harboring plant cdna constructs complementation depended strictly on addition of the iptg inducer indicating that the plant cdnas were responsible for the effect . retransformation of the yeast mutant with rescued plasmid containing the arabidopsis cdna restored _PROTEIN_ prototrophy further confirming that complementation was due to the plant cdna . taken together these data indicate that plant paba pabb proteins have paba plus pabb activity _PROTEIN_ but say nothing about their pabc activity . arabidopsis paba pabb has adc synthase but not lyase activity . to investigate _PROTEIN_ and lyase activities directly the mature arabidopsis paba pabb protein was overexpressed in e. coli by using the pet plasmid and the host strain codonplus ril . _PROTEIN_ activity was first assayed in desalted extracts by using glutamine as amino donor and adding excess e. coli pabc to convert adc to _PROTEIN_ which was quantified by hplc . in this coupled assay vector alone cell extracts produced traces of _PROTEIN_ attributable to the endogenous paba and pabb activities of the host . extracts of cells overexpressing the arabidopsis paba pabb protein gave fold more _PROTEIN_ providing initial biochemical evidence for _PROTEIN_ activity . to corroborate this result and to test for adc lyase activity we used size exclusion chromatography to separate the recombinant arabidopsis paba pabb protein from the e. coli host 's pabc enzyme which is smaller . by using glutamine as amino donor the column fractions were assayed for _PROTEIN_ formation plus or minus addition of e. coli pabc . when pabc was added there was a large peak of _PROTEIN_ forming activity at kda which is close to the predicted _METHOD_ of the monomeric recombinant enzyme . this peak disappeared when pabc was omitted and was not given by extracts of cells transformed with vector alone . the minor peak of _PROTEIN_ formation in fractions is attributable to endogenous activity from the host cells . these data show that the arabidopsis paba pabb protein has _PROTEIN_ activity but lacks adc lyase activity . the arabidopsis and tomato proteins may thus be termed _PROTEIN_ . the atadcs peak of fig ref was unstable losing all activity within h at . amino donors and inhibitors of arabidopsis adc synthase . when testing amino donors we compared the arabidopsis enzyme with the e. coli enzyme using assay conditions developed for the latter . like paba atadcs did not use asparagine . atadcs was able to use like pabb but apparently more efficiently because the dependent rate was of the glutamine dependent rate for atadcs but only for pabb . atadcs was not inhibited by physiological concentrations of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ ester or folates nor was it sensitive to the _PROTEIN_ analogs _PROTEIN_ ethyl ester p acetamidobenzoate p hydroxybenzoate or anthranilate . subcellular localization of arabidopsis adc synthase . to analyze the subcellular localization of atadcs in vivo its n terminal region was fused to the _METHOD_ marker protein . _PROTEIN_ of this fusion protein in arabidopsis protoplasts resulted in a punctate pattern of green _METHOD_ that colocalized with the red _METHOD_ of chlorophyll . in contrast control protoplasts _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ alone showed green _METHOD_ throughout the cytoplasm and _LOCATION_ . these data demonstrate that atadcs contains a functional chloroplast targeting peptide suggesting that plant _PROTEIN_ is a _LOCATION_ enzyme . adc synthase mrna _PROTEIN_ during tomato fruit development . because nothing is known about _PROTEIN_ synthesis in plants we measured leadcs transcript _PROTEIN_ and total _PROTEIN_ pools in leaves and in fruits harvested at four stages . leadcs mrna levels in unripe fruits were initially of that in leaves but dropped dramatically to beneath the detection limit after the breaker stage . the detection of the nr transcript which is induced in ripening fruit showed that this fall was not due to general mrna degradation as ripening advanced . concentrations of _PROTEIN_ in the fruit increased progressively as the fruit ripened from the mature green to the red and red ripe stages . as previously observed the majority of _PROTEIN_ was present as its _PROTEIN_ ester .
