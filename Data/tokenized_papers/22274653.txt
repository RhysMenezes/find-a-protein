_LOCATION_ in chloroplasts are _LOCATION_ associated monolayer lipoprotein particles containing prenyl and neutral lipids and several dozen proteins mostly with unknown functions . an integrated view of the role of the pg is lacking . here we better define the pg proteome and provide a conceptual framework for further studies . the pg proteome from arabidopsis leaf chloroplasts was determined by _METHOD_ _METHOD_ of isolated pgs and quantitative comparison with the proteomes of unfractionated leaves _LOCATION_ and stroma . scanning electron microscopy showed the purity and size distribution of the isolated pgs . compared with previous pg proteome analyses we excluded several proteins and identified six new pg proteins including an metallopeptidase and two absence of complex _PROTEIN_ atypical kinases confirmed by immunoblotting . this refined pg proteome consisted of proteins including six _PROTEIN_ kinases and seven fibrillins together comprising more than of the pg protein _METHOD_ . other fibrillins were located predominantly in the stroma or _LOCATION_ and not in pgs we discovered that this partitioning can be predicted by their isoelectric point and hydrophobicity . a genome wide coexpression network for the pg genes was then constructed from mrna _PROTEIN_ data . this revealed a modular network with four distinct modules that each contained at least one _PROTEIN_ and/or fibrillin gene . each module showed clear enrichment in specific functions including chlorophyll degradation/senescence isoprenoid biosynthesis _LOCATION_ proteolysis and redox regulators and phosphoregulators of electron flow . we propose a new testable model for the pgs in which sets of genes are associated with specific pg functions .
as starting material for our study we grew arabidopsis plants on soil for weeks at photons and transferred them to for d. the higher light intensity increased pg volume and yield and made them more amenable for experimental analysis . the mild light stress treatment accelerated vegetative growth increased anthocyanin accumulation in the leaves and resulted in only minor visible damage at the edges of the oldest leaves but no damage to younger leaves . isolation of pgs from the arabidopsis leaf rosettes was performed by sonication of isolated _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ followed by flotation density centrifugation . the enrichment of pgs was confirmed by immunodetection of the _PROTEIN_ protein known to be uniquely localized in the pg as determined by yellow _METHOD_ protein localization and immunogold labeling immunoelectron tomography and proteomics . densitometric analysis of the immunoblots indicated a more than fold enrichment of _PROTEIN_ in the pg preparations compared with the original _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . we also measured an approximately fold depletion of _PROTEIN_ in _LOCATION_ following sonication indicating that approximately of the pg material is extracted from the _LOCATION_ by sonication . hence our results demonstrate that the isolated pgs were highly enriched for pg particles and that the majority of the pgs were successfully extracted from the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . transmission electron microscopy of pgs in vivo demonstrated a broad size distribution even within the same chloroplast however the relationship between pg size and the pg proteome is not known . for a correct and meaningful quantitative and qualitative analysis of the pg proteome therefore it was critical to extract pgs representing the entire in vivo population without bias for size or other properties while keeping contamination from _LOCATION_ and other compartments to a minimum . therefore we compared the size distribution of the extracted pg particles with the in vivo size distribution . tem of the leaf tissue showed a broad distribution of pg sizes with diameters ranging from approximately nm to approximately nm and peaking between and nm . pg preparations were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy _PROTEIN_ and also showed a broad size distribution from approximately nm to approximately nm peaking between and nm . this demonstrated that pgs of all physiologically relevant sizes were extracted efficiently with a small bias to smaller particles . interestingly the micrographs of pg preparations sometimes showed pgs in grape like clusters similar to those described in tem micrographs of leaves . despite the clustering found in the preparations each pg clearly _PROTEIN_ its individual structure and they did not coalesce . apparently component at the pg solution interface act to _PROTEIN_ pg structural integrity and are extractable with the pgs likely a _PROTEIN_ coat surrounding the pg periphery . evidence of minor amounts of _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ fragments was also found in the micrographs . while the isolated pgs demonstrated remarkably smooth surfaces _PROTEIN_ also showed infrequent amorphous structures generally attached to pgs . the size of these structures the presence of attached pgs and their amorphous shape suggested that they are _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ fragments . importantly these amorphous structures were far less abundant than the pgs indicating high pg purity which was further confirmed by the proteomics experiments . summarizing our results demonstrate that more than approximately of the pgs from all physiologically relevant sizes were successfully extracted from the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ into highly enriched pg preparations . the first comprehensive pg proteome analyses were carried out using a quadrupole time of flight _METHOD_ spectrometer or a lcq deca xp ion trap _METHOD_ spectrometer . recent improvements in the sensitivity _METHOD_ accuracy and speed of _METHOD_ spectrometers have enabled the detection of lower abundance proteins in complex mixtures and also facilitated _METHOD_ _METHOD_ based label free proteome quantification using spectral counting . thus a much more sensitive and quantitative analysis of the pg proteome should now be possible . the spectral counting technique is based on the observation that the number of successful tandem _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ acquisitions of peptides coming from a protein shows a positive and linear correlation to the relative concentration of this protein in the studied sample . spectral counting is particularly effective to detect large quantitative differences as expected in our study where we compare cellular or suborganellar fractions that are very different in function and composition . we previously optimized the spectral counting workflow and tested it for arabidopsis and maize organelles cell types and complexes . the relative normalized abundance _METHOD_ of each protein within each sample nadjspc was calculated from the number of adjusted matched _METHOD_ spectra normalized to the total adjspc per sample as defined previously . thus a protein with nadjspc contributes approximately of the protein _METHOD_ of the analyzed sample . as a general rule the accuracy of quantification improves with the number of adjspc per protein . here we employed an ltq orbitrap _METHOD_ spectrometer coupled to a nano liquid chromatography system to search for additional more low abundance proteins located in the pg . moreover we reevaluated previous assignments of proteins to the pg based on quantitative comparative proteome information . using three independent pg preparations the pg proteome was analyzed in two different ways pg proteins were separated by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ each lane cut in five slices and in gel digested with trypsin and unfractionated pgs were delipidized and digested in solution with trypsin . these protein digests were then analyzed by _METHOD_ in the ltq orbitrap . the rationale for using these two different protein extraction/separation methods was to maximize the detection of low abundance proteins increase the robustness of protein quantification and improve protein sequence coverage . proteins identified by only a single peptide sequence irrespective of posttranslational modification or charge state were discarded to increase the robustness of the analysis and avoid any false positive protein identification these proteins represented less than of the protein _METHOD_ in pgs . the combined proteome analysis identified proteins with identified by both in solution and in gel workflows and six or proteins identified in only the in solution or in gel digestion respectively . the proteins identified by both methods represented approximately of the pg protein _METHOD_ showing that only the least abundant proteins were not identified by both methods . the in solution and in gel methods showed a good correlation for the relative protein abundance for proteins with abundance of greater than _METHOD_ . protein sequence coverage was on average for the in gel method and for the in solution method this increased to and respectively if we only considered the proteins identified by both methods . the correlation of the average nadjspc values between the three biological replicates was excellent with pairwise correlation coefficients between and . we then determined those proteins highly enriched in the pgs hereafter named the core pg proteome using the workflow as depicted in figure . the core pg proteins were distinguished from nonplastid contaminants or proteins localized primarily elsewhere in the chloroplast by comparing the abundance in pgs with their average abundance in total leaf extracts and isolated _LOCATION_ and stromal fractions . supplemental table provides the quantitative and qualitative data about these proteomes . furthermore core pg proteins were required to have a minimal abundance and can be observed in the pgs by both in gel and in solution methods . for the selection of core pg proteins we first discarded those proteins with a pg leaf abundance ratio below only proteins out of the proteins passed this first filter . we emphasize that this was a relatively relaxed minimal threshold considering that the pg proteome represents less than of the leaf proteome however this was already very effective to remove nonplastid contaminants as well as the abundant proteins of the photosynthetic apparatus and other proteins not truly enriched in pgs . importantly it also removed several proteins that were earlier assigned to the pg including fructose bisphosphate aldolase and _PROTEIN_ . furthermore _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were also eliminated because they showed pg leaf abundance ratios of only and respectively . the relative abundance and distribution of the remaining proteins between pgs _LOCATION_ and stroma are displayed in figure b and c. as a next step we removed proteins that failed to show at least a fold enrichment in the isolated pgs compared with the _LOCATION_ . this resulted in the removal of four proteins a dnaj domain protein a glutaredoxin a protein with an unknown function _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . finally four proteins with a pg stroma abundance ratio below were discarded these were thioredoxin uv b/ozone similarly regulated protein an unknown protein with a _PROTEIN_ domain and _PROTEIN_ . the remaining proteins were then evaluated for abundance and frequency of identification in the pg proteome analysis . twelve proteins with a relative abundance below nadjspc of _METHOD_ or only identified by one of the methods were discarded . finally we manually evaluated the remaining proteins for known subcellular localization and/or function . two proteins were discarded from the core proteome based on literature evidence . the extraplastidic caleosin protein _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ has been shown to be localized in _LOCATION_ lipoprotein particles while a domain protein _PROTEIN_ is likely _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ localized based on _METHOD_ tagging _METHOD_ . thus these proteins were removed from the final list . because the pgs were isolated from plants shifted for d to higher light intensities we also determined and quantified the total leaf proteome of these plants . however using these quantitative total leaf proteome data in the workflow did not affect the final selection of core pg proteins . table ii summarizes the core pg proteome with their relative abundance and enrichment as compared with other _LOCATION_ compartments . the cv of protein abundance across the three biological replicates was indicating an excellent reproducibility . twenty three of the core proteins were previously assigned to the pg with identified in both studies . _PROTEIN_ showed a pg _LOCATION_ ratio of consistent with the high ratio determined by the immunoblot analysis and was not detected in chloroplast stroma . another seven proteins were newly identified as plastoglobular namely two _PROTEIN_ kinases _PROTEIN_ a domain protein an esterase domain protein two proteins of unknown function _PROTEIN_ and a metallopeptidase domain protein . six of these seven proteins are the lowest abundance proteins of the core pg proteome explaining their previous lack of detection . thirteen proteins previously assigned to the pg did not pass our filters these were _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ two rna associated proteins an _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ peroxiredoxin q _PROTEIN_ and three proteins of unknown function . the four most abundant proteins were all _PROTEIN_ proteins _PROTEIN_ and were also found previously to be the homologs of the _PROTEIN_ in red pepper chromoplast pgs suggesting that they may hold a general function in the _PROTEIN_ of _LOCATION_ lipid body structure . the six _PROTEIN_ core proteins constituted of the pg proteome _METHOD_ . the second most abundant class of core proteins consisted of six _PROTEIN_ kinases together constituting of the core pg proteome _METHOD_ . the original _PROTEIN_ proteins identified in saccharomyces cerevisiae _PROTEIN_ and e. coli are implicated in the regulation of ubiquinone metabolism . in particular the phosphorylation of several members of the ubiquinone biosynthetic complex is dependent on _PROTEIN_ . however the role and possible targets of the pg localized _PROTEIN_ proteins are unknown . carotenoid cleavage _PROTEIN_ with specificity for apo caroten al in arabidopsis was of the proteome _METHOD_ . the _PROTEIN_ protein involved in tocopherol biosynthesis was of the proteome _METHOD_ and nad h dehydrogenase _PROTEIN_ which reduces plastoquinone to plastoquinol and is necessary for _PROTEIN_ synthesis was of the proteome _METHOD_ . the protein was only of the proteome _METHOD_ . to further validate our quantitative proteomics analysis we generated specific antisera against three pg core proteins _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and the low abundance protease because of its novelty as a potential pg localized protease . specific polyclonal antisera were raised against affinity purified e. coli overexpressed domains of each of the three proteins . after confirming the specificity of the sera we compared isolated _LOCATION_ fractions and isolated pgs for protein abundance of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ using immunoblots . figure shows that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and were approximately and more than fold enriched in isolated pgs compared with _LOCATION_ in agreement with the pg _LOCATION_ abundance ratios of and respectively measured by _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . this provides independent evidence that metallopeptidase and the two _PROTEIN_ proteins are highly enriched in the pg and indicates that our _METHOD_ _METHOD_ based quantitative analysis does provide reliable information about the core pg proteome . we identified all known _PROTEIN_ as well as a _PROTEIN_ like protein _PROTEIN_ in our collective proteome data sets of leaves chloroplast stroma _LOCATION_ and pgs . however we assigned only seven _PROTEIN_ to the pg core proteome based on our quantitative analysis because the other _PROTEIN_ did not preferentially locate to pgs . therefore we searched for physical chemical properties of the _PROTEIN_ protein family that correlated with subplastid localization . we also included two truncation products of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ whose localizations were determined by yellow _METHOD_ protein tagging as localized to the stroma and pg respectively . the combination of pi and hydrophobicity calculated as the grand average of hydropathicity _PROTEIN_ index for each of the _PROTEIN_ correlated surprisingly well with their relative distribution between stroma _LOCATION_ and pg . the _PROTEIN_ proteins could be placed in one of four groups strongly enriched in the pg equal enrichment between the pg and _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ strongly enriched in the _LOCATION_ as compared with pg and stroma localized not identified in pg or _LOCATION_ . all seven pg localized _PROTEIN_ as well as the truncated _PROTEIN_ were found to display low pis and higher hydrophobicity indices . conversely all four _PROTEIN_ strongly enriched in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ fraction displayed higher pis and lower hydrophobicity indices . importantly _PROTEIN_ the only _PROTEIN_ with an approximately equal ratio between pg and _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ showed intermediate pi and hydrophobicity index . finally the stroma localized _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ demonstrated low pi and the lowest hydrophobicity indices of the protein products . the pi and _PROTEIN_ index however did not predict subplastid localization of other members of the core pg proteome likely because they have very diverse secondary structures . because the functions of most pg proteins are unknown and hard to predict we employed a genome wide transcript coexpression analysis to identify putative functions for the pg core proteins identify potential targets for the _PROTEIN_ proteins generate testable hypotheses and provide a better framework for further studies . several coexpression analysis tools have been developed and employed in plant coexpression analysis each offering its own suite of functions and set of normalized microarray experiments . we tested and compared three different publicly available coexpression tools metaomgraph the botany array resource and the arabidopsis coexpression data mining tool for their ability to identify coexpression relationships among functionally and physically associated gene products . using the well studied gene family encoding for the clppr protease complex in _LOCATION_ and mitochondria and genes encoding for enzymes involved in tetrapyrrole biosynthesis we first demonstrated that although the three software _METHOD_ metaomgraph bar and act show quantitative differences in coexpression rankings true coexpressers were consistently found . we also tested to see if pg core genes preferentially _PROTEIN_ with other pg core genes rather than genes encoding for _LOCATION_ proteins in general or with genes encoding for extraplastidic proteins . this showed that pg core genes generally preferentially coexpress with other pg genes at higher pearson correlation coefficient . importantly these tests also showed that genes encoding for _LOCATION_ proteins are clearly not coexpressed as a single group thus we should be able to find specific coexpression patterns for pg core proteins . the selection of test sets procedures and results is described in more detail in the supplemental text . we chose to employ the metaomgraph program to investigate the pg coexpression network because of its user friendly nature and validated the final results with the other two _METHOD_ . we discarded from the analysis those probes measuring multiple genes to ensure that we were testing specific gene gene coexpression relationships . the resulting set contained affymetrix microarray probes including of the pg core genes . pg core genes _PROTEIN_ and as well as had to be excluded because they were not represented by unique probes whereas the soul and genes were not represented on the microarrays . a pg network was constructed from a genome wide search for each of the pg core genes on the affymetrix microarray . some of the pg genes e.g . _PROTEIN_ and aldo/keto reductase _PROTEIN_ unknown had several hundred coexpressing genes above a pcc threshold of whereas other genes _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ had none above that threshold . therefore we used the strongest coexpressing genes for each pg core gene to construct a pg network rather than applying a minimal pcc threshold . all such coexpression relationships had a pcc above with the exception of the domain protein and the sag protein with unknown function . strong negative correlations between genes can be relevant however negative pcc values never exceeded an absolute value of and therefore only positive correlations became part of the pg network . the resulting network contained nodes and edges . of the nodes were assigned to the _LOCATION_ based on experimental information . interestingly the pg core proteins differed strongly in the subcellular localization of their coexpressers . for instance in the case of the five _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and several others to out of of the coexpressers were _LOCATION_ localized however core proteins _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and domain protein each had three or fewer _LOCATION_ localized coexpressers . this immediately suggests that the latter proteins are primarily posttranscriptionally regulated or that their transcriptional regulation is integrated with extraplastidic functions and needs . to better assign functions to the pg core genes and the pg as a whole coexpressing genes were categorized by their assigned functional category and edges connecting to each bin were counted . because some bins were much larger than others and thus had a much greater opportunity to be represented in the pg network we normalized the representation of each bin by its size . as indicated in table iii a strong enrichment was found for _LOCATION_ localized proteases _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ proteins involved in cyclic/alternative electron flow _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and regulators of the light reaction state transition kinase _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ localized isoprenoid metabolism _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ chlorophyll degradation _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _LOCATION_ redox regulation _PROTEIN_ . to further substantiate the findings from the metaomgraph coexpression analysis we analyzed the functional enrichment of the top coexpressers using the two other software _METHOD_ bar and act . clearly the distribution of functional groups was consistent between all three _METHOD_ strengthening the significance of the metaomgraph analysis . the coexpression network showed that most core genes had associations with other pg genes producing a gene _PROTEIN_ network with four clusters of nodes which we refer to as modules. modules are parts of biological networks in which nodes are densely connected with each other but between which there are only sparse connections . thus within each of these modules genes coexpress more tightly to each other than with genes outside the module . the modular nature is an important property of biological networks . as will be detailed below the four modules each showed enrichment for specific functions . the remainder of the pg core genes _PROTEIN_ had no or weaker associations with other pg genes moreover they had in common that most of their coexpressers encoded for extraplastidic proteins . module with four pg core genes _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was enriched for senescence functions in particular chlorophyll degradation _PROTEIN_ and a variety of proteases outside the _LOCATION_ as well as the senescence induced clp protease chaperone _PROTEIN_ . the two chlorophyll degradation enzymes coexpressed with _PROTEIN_ and sag and we note that a third more downstream enzyme was found in module coexpressing with _PROTEIN_ . strikingly only of the edges in module were _LOCATION_ localized compared with to for the other modules consistent with the observation that senescence leads to controlled breakdown of the whole cell and is not limited to _LOCATION_ . we also point out an interesting _LOCATION_ localized putative tyr kinase that coexpressed with both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . the role for protease is completely unknown and its coexpressers included five _LOCATION_ proteins with unknown function and four _LOCATION_ localized proteins _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ alternative oxidase _PROTEIN_ and a glutaredoxin thioredoxin . the most extensive module was centrally located in the pg network and comprised eight pg genes _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . it was particularly enriched for carotenoid metabolism enzymes and _LOCATION_ proteases of the nodes encoded for _LOCATION_ proteins indicating tight integration with _LOCATION_ functions . in addition to the _LOCATION_ carotenoid enzymes also upstream _LOCATION_ solanesyl diphosphate synthase _PROTEIN_ and its _LOCATION_ isoform _PROTEIN_ were part of this module . interestingly transcription _PROTEIN_ known to coregulate the _PROTEIN_ of a suite of _LOCATION_ photosynthetic genes was also part of this module as a coexpresser of _PROTEIN_ . within module _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were particularly tightly connected mostly through coexpressing _LOCATION_ proteases . the top coexpressers of _PROTEIN_ were almost exclusively involved in carotenoid metabolism _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and protein degradation _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ but also included _LOCATION_ kinase _PROTEIN_ involved in the phosphorylation of lhc proteins facilitating state transitions to optimize electron flow . the third module involved five pg core genes _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and was particularly enriched in redox regulators and photoacclimation. eighty nine percent of the edges encoded for assigned _LOCATION_ proteins . the module was highly enriched for _LOCATION_ redox regulators and nonlinear electron flow components _PROTEIN_ as well as several _LOCATION_ proteases _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . also the _LOCATION_ phosphatase _PROTEIN_ and the gene coding for the acclimation of photosynthesis to environment were part of this module . the fourth and smallest module contained pg core proteins _PROTEIN_ and unknown and was strongly enriched for proteins involved in various aspects of _LOCATION_ biogenesis including proteases and the calvin cycle . remarkably pg core protein unknown coexpressed with six different calvin cycle genes _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ as well as the catalytic subunit of gly decarboxylase critical for photorespiration . _PROTEIN_ appears to be involved in _LOCATION_ biogenesis among its top coexpressers are genes coding for _LOCATION_ vesicle inducing protein in _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ division protein giant and several genes of protein synthesis assembly folding and targeting . mep enzymes _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were also found in module as coexpressers of _PROTEIN_ and and _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ was positioned between modules and and its coexpressers _LOCATION_ were enriched in _LOCATION_ biogenesis photosynthesis and several proteins without known function . _PROTEIN_ connected to both modules and and its coexpressers _LOCATION_ were enriched in ndh subunits transporters and various unknowns . it is important to note that only one of the genes _PROTEIN_ encoding for known structural proteins of the linear electron transport chain and _PROTEIN_ synthase _PROTEIN_ coexpressed with the pg core genes . however two of the three known genes that control state transitions _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and several structural components of cyclic or alternative _PROTEIN_ electron flow were part of the coexpression network . this suggests that the pg function is tightly integrated with cyclic electron flow or the balance between psi and psii activity . we note that four lumenal oec like proteins with unknown function as well as two unusual low abundance lhci and lhcii proteins _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were found as coexpressers suggesting that they have functions related to optimization of the light reactions under stress conditions . indeed lhci is a component of the psi ndh supercomplex and necessary for its formation and stability particularly under times of stress . the coexpression profile was found to be very similar to that of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and involved in chlorophyll or tocopherol biosynthesis . lhcii was found to be up regulated in response to light stress and blue or far red light treatment . three of the pg core proteins were not placed in the coexpression network because they were on the same probe as a close homolog . indeed evaluation of on the same probe as a closely related nonplastid homolog _PROTEIN_ showed that the top coexpressers were mostly involved with senescence but not in the _LOCATION_ and they did not connect well to the pg network however homologs _PROTEIN_ and b both pg core proteins and together on a single probe spot connected tightly in the network with coexpression with core protein _PROTEIN_ and its coexpressers rbcx and _PROTEIN_ and also coexpressing with _PROTEIN_ and pot both coexpressers of _PROTEIN_ . thus _PROTEIN_ is located in the network between module and module . the coexpression network suggested that a subset of the pg localized proteins is involved in senescence responses . therefore we tested for five genes _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ from module whether transcript accumulation was indeed up regulated during natural senescence . as a control we also tested two genes from module _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ that have no obvious senescence association in the network . to that end arabidopsis rosette leaves were harvested during bolting and flowering during which leaves show increased visual signs of natural leaf senescence . because pgs are found to accumulate fatty acid phytyl esters with the phytol generated by breakdown of chlorophyll the uncharacterized esterase identified in our pg core proteome is an excellent candidate enzyme for the esterification of free phytol at the pg . the flux into phytol esterification would be expected to be highest during senescence induced chlorophyll degradation and we thus tested whether _PROTEIN_ of the esterase which is not represented on the microarrays is also senescence induced . reverse transcription pcr experiments were then carried out on three biological replicates . indeed _PROTEIN_ of the five genes from the senescence associated module and the esterase but not the two genes from module is induced by senescence thus providing support for our coexpression network and our hypothesized functions for the esterase and mcs gene products .
the pg isolation method was _PROTEIN_ from citation . for each pg preparation two flats of arabidopsis were grown on soil for weeks under photons with a h photoperiod . plants were then transferred to photons during the dark period . in the morning of day leaf tissue was harvested and homogenized in grinding buffer . homogenate was filtered through four layers of miracloth and _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ were pelleted by centrifugation for min at . _LOCATION_ pellets were washed once in volumes of grinding buffer and resuspended in medium r containing m suc . an aliquot of resuspended _LOCATION_ material was stored at to be used as the presonicated _LOCATION_ fraction . the remainder was sonicated four times for s each at output power of w returning the samples to ice between each sonication event . sonicated samples were centrifuged for min at and pgs released from the _LOCATION_ floated to the surface of the solution . pgs were removed and combined with medium r with m suc to achieve a suc concentration of m which was then overlaid with medium r with m suc and medium r with no suc . the gradient was centrifuged for min at . the resulting floating pad of pgs was removed flash frozen in liquid and stored at . nucleotide sequences encoding the soluble part of the protein and the c termini of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were amplified by pcr . the resulting dna fragments were ligated into restriction sites of the _PROTEIN_ vector coding for a c terminal his affinity tag . the vector was transformed into escherichia coli cells and overexpressed protein was harvested from liquid culture after incubation in mm isopropylthio galactoside for h at . proteins were solubilized in mm nacl mm tris and m urea at ph and purified on a nickel nitrotriacetic acid agarose resin _PROTEIN_ and polyclonal antibodies were raised in rabbits by injecting purified antigen . protein concentrations were estimated by the bicinchoninic acid method using a bca kit . protein samples were solubilized in laemmli buffer _PROTEIN_ heated for min at and separated on an _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ gel . proteins were blotted to nitrocellulose probed with purified anti peptidase anti _PROTEIN_ anti _PROTEIN_ or anti _PROTEIN_ serum and visualized by the horseradish peroxidase based enhanced chemiluminescence system . densitometric analysis of relevant spots was performed using the imagej software program . leaf tissue from three individuals of each genotype at each time point was harvested h after the beginning of the photoperiod . leaf margins and midribs were excluded and the remaining leaf tissue was divided into mm sections with a fresh razor blade . sections were fixed in glutaraldehyde paraformaldehyde tannic acid and mm _PROTEIN_ buffer ph for h and then washed three times in mm _PROTEIN_ buffer ph . tissues were fixed in osmium tetroxide and mm _PROTEIN_ ph for h and washed three times in mm _PROTEIN_ ph . tissues were then stained in uranyl acetate for h and washed twice in ultrapure water . fixed and stained tissues were carried through an acetone series of increasing concentrations . dehydrated tissue was then embedded with spurr s resin in increasing concentrations of resin in acetone according to the manufacturer s instructions . fully embedded tissue was cured in resin blocks at overnight . cured resin blocks were sectioned and imaged at electron microscopy services . two to of purified pg sample was spotted onto a silica wafer . a drop of in mm potassium phosphate ph was added to the drop of the pg sample on the silica wafer . the buffered was allowed to remain in contact with the pgs for h at . after h the wafers were floated on a droplet of mm potassium phosphate buffer at ph for min . this was done three times at . the wafers were then floated on drops of glutaraldehyde in mm potassium phosphate ph for h at . after h the wafers were floated on drops of mm potassium phosphate ph for min at . the wafers were then floated on drops of distilled water for min at . the wafers were dehydrated by floating on first then then then and finally ethanol for approximately min each at . the wafers were then critical point dried in ethanol _METHOD_ mounted on specimen supports and sputter coated with gold/palladium . the wafers were viewed at kv in a hitachi scanning electron microscope . for in solution digestion isolated pgs were precipitated in tca overnight at . precipitated proteins were pelleted by centrifugation and washed once with acetone and once with acetone methanol and acetic acid by incubating at for h each . washed pellets were resuspended in dimethyl sulfoxide and quantified by the bca method using a bca kit . five _METHOD_ of protein was digested with modified trypsin . salts and detergents were removed by ziptip and dried down in a speed vac . digested and washed samples were resuspended in of formic acid immediately prior to loading on the lc _METHOD_ instrument . for gel based separation and in gel digestion pg samples were lyophilized and solubilized in a modified laemmli solubilization buffer _PROTEIN_ . samples were shaken gently at for min to ensure complete solubilization and subsequently heated at for min . samples were centrifuged to remove insoluble material and proteins were separated by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . each gel lane was cut in five slices and proteins were digested with trypsin as described . wild type plants were grown on soil for d under a short day cycle at photons . the complete leaf rosettes were then harvested and proteins were immediately quantitatively extracted in the presence of _PROTEIN_ as described in detail by citation . alternatively plants were transferred and grown on soil for weeks under similar conditions as above but transferred to photons conditions . in the morning of day leaf tissue was harvested and extracted as above . peptides prepared from in gel digestion and in solution digestion were analyzed by data dependent _METHOD_ using online lc ltq orbitrap with dynamic exclusion as described . peak lists were generated using dta supercharge software _METHOD_ and searched with mascot version _PROTEIN_ against a combined database containing the arabidopsis genome with protein coding gene models and sequences for known contaminants and concatenated with a _PROTEIN_ database where all the sequences were randomized in total this database contained protein sequences . offline calibration for all precursor ions was done as described by citation . each of the peak lists was searched using mascot version for full tryptic peptides using a precursor ion tolerance set at ppm fixed cys _PROTEIN_ methylation and variable met oxidation protein n terminal acetylation asn/gln deamidation and maximally one missed cleavage allowed . the maximum fragment ion tolerance _METHOD_ was d. for semitryptic peptides the search was performed with a precursor ion tolerance set at ppm fixed cys _PROTEIN_ methylation and variable met oxidation n terminal acetylation gln deamidation and maximally one missed cleavage allowed . the minimal ion score threshold was chosen such that a peptide false discovery rate below was achieved . using an in house written filter the search results were further filtered as follows . for identification with two or more peptides the minimum ion score threshold was set to . for protein identification based on a single peptide the minimum ion score threshold was set to and the _METHOD_ accuracy of the precursor ion was required to be within ppm . the peptide false discovery rate was calculated as _PROTEIN_ / _PROTEIN_ and was below . the false discovery rate of proteins identified with two or more peptides was zero . peptides with less than seven amino acids were discarded . all _METHOD_ spectral data are available via the proteomics identifications database at http //www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/ with accession numbers to . several arabidopsis genes have more than one gene model and in such cases the protein form with the highest number of matched spectra was selected if two gene models had the same number of matched spectra the model with the lower digit was selected . for quantification each protein accession was scored for total spectral counts unique spc and adjusted spc . the latter assigns shared peptides to accessions in proportion to their relative abundance using unique spectral counts for each accession as a basis . the nadjspc for each protein was calculated through division of adjspc by the sum of all adjspc values for the proteins from that gel lane . nadjspc provides a relative protein abundance measure by _METHOD_ whereas the normalized spectral abundance _PROTEIN_ estimates relative protein concentration within a particular sample as defined by citation . the pccs of all pairwise combinations between pg genes and all single gene probes of the arabidopsis affymetrix microarray were calculated using three different software _METHOD_ the metaomgraph software program the bar _PROTEIN_ angler and the act web site . metaomgraph analysis used the publicly available project containing normalized averaged arabidopsis experimental data sets obtained from nascarrays and plexdb from experiments and microarray _PROTEIN_ from diverse environmental and genotypic conditions and tissue types and developmental stages . correlations were calculated using the pearson correlation algorithm . visualization of the metaomgraph derived network was performed in cytoscape version applying the force directed layout algorithm . coexpression analysis using the bar _PROTEIN_ angler was performed for each pg gene by searching in the nascarrrays data set available at the web site . analysis at the act web site was performed for each pg gene by using the co _PROTEIN_ analysis over available array experiments option . wild type arabidopsis col was grown on soil . leaf tissue was selected from five time points

chlorotic senescing leaf approximately chlorotic week _PROTEIN_ in senescence . total rna was extracted from leaf tissue using the rneasy plant miniprep kit according to the manufacturer s instructions . seven hundred _METHOD_ of total rna was used for the synthesis of cdna using oligo primer and the superscript iii cdna synthesis kit according to the manufacturer s instructions . cdna samples were diluted to equal concentration by normalizing according to amplification of the gene using cycles . each gene was then amplified for cycles using an equal volume of template and an appropriate gene specific primer pair . signal intensity was quantified using the alpha imager version software package . the forward and reverse primers are as follows for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and
