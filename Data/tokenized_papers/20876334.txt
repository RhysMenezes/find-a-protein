environmental stresses are major _PROTEIN_ in limiting plant growth and crop production . to find genes improving salt tolerance the screening of a large population of transgenic arabidopsis thaliana that _PROTEIN_ rice full length cdnas under salinity stress is reported here . in this study one of the isolated salt tolerant lines was analysed in detail . an uncharacterized rice gene _PROTEIN_ protein enhancing _PROTEIN_ tolerance was integrated in . newly constructed transgenic arabidopsis that overexpressed oscest or its arabidopsis homologue _PROTEIN_ showed improved tolerance to salinity stress . oscest and _PROTEIN_ were _PROTEIN_ transcribed in photosynthetic tissues . green _METHOD_ protein fused oscest and _PROTEIN_ proteins were localized to the chloroplast in the arabidopsis leaf protoplasts . _PROTEIN_ overexpressing arabidopsis showed enhanced tolerance not only to salt stress but also to drought stress high temperature stress and paraquat which causes photooxidative stress . under saline conditions overexpression of _PROTEIN_ modulated the stress induced impairment of photosynthetic activity and the peroxidation of lipids . reduced _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ because of double stranded rna interference resulted in the impairment of photosynthetic activity the reduction of green pigment defects in chloroplast development and growth retardation under light . this paper discusses the relationship between the chloroplast protein _PROTEIN_ and photooxidative damage .
previously rice fox arabidopsis lines were selected as candidates for salt tolerant lines and several of them have been analysed individually . one of the candidates looked remarkably healthy retaining greener cotyledons when sown on salt containing agar medium compared with the other fox candidates . to amplify the rice cdna introduced in genomic pcr with specific primers for the promoter and nos terminator was performed . the fragment obtained corresponded to a rice full length cdna _PROTEIN_ which was derived from a rice gene . the direct relation between _PROTEIN_ and salt tolerant phenotype of was demonstrated by retransformation experiments . ten of the newly generated transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ exhibited high salt stress tolerance at the generation as well as showing that overexpression of _PROTEIN_ is responsible for the salt tolerance of the line . the gene was named as _PROTEIN_ protein enhancing _PROTEIN_ tolerance for reasons explained in _PROTEIN_ sections . arabidopsis has a homologous gene _GENE_ to . seven of the transgenic arabidopsis lines overexpressing _PROTEIN_ also showed high salt stress tolerance at the generation . the salt tolerant phenotype of homozygous transgenics overexpressing oscest or _PROTEIN_ is shown in fig . and c. because of a single copy insertion and higher _PROTEIN_ of the transgenes homozygous offspring of oscest line no . and _PROTEIN_ line no . were used for further experiments at the or generations . although the lamina blade of _PROTEIN_ overexpressing arabidopsis is slightly narrower no obvious growth inhibition was observed . deduced products of oscest and _PROTEIN_ are polypeptides of and amino acid residues with estimated molecular _METHOD_ of kda and kda respectively . oscest and _PROTEIN_ were highly homologous to each other except for the n terminals of approximately amino acid residues . the chlorop program predicted that both proteins contained transit peptides in their n terminals which directed localization to _LOCATION_ . the sosui program showed that these proteins have putative transmembrane regions at their c terminals . no other characterized motifs or domains were detected in oscest and _PROTEIN_ . a blast search revealed _PROTEIN_ homologues mostly as single genes in plants such as tomato maize barley populus and physcomitrella and in some green algae such as chlamydomonas and ostreococcus . however _PROTEIN_ homologues are absent in the genomes of bacteria and animals indicating that _PROTEIN_ is specific to photosynthetic _METHOD_ . tissue specific _PROTEIN_ of oscest and _PROTEIN_ was investigated by performing the quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction . in rice transcripts of oscest were detected at high levels in leaf tissues and at moderate levels in flowers and oscest _PROTEIN_ was remarkably repressed in roots . in arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ in rosette and cauline leaves and flowers at a higher level than that at the roots . the tissue specificity of the _PROTEIN_ promoter was examined using transgenic arabidopsis with the promoter region of _PROTEIN_ fused to the gus gene _PROTEIN_ . transgenic arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ the gus gene under the direction of the promoter was used as the control . intense signals of gus were detected to be originating from the cotyledons rosette and cauline leaves _METHOD_ and sepals of _PROTEIN_ gus plants grown under light conditions while no gus signals were obtained from the roots and _PROTEIN_ indicating that _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ is specific to photosynthetic tissues . when seedlings were grown in the dark gus signals were detected in the cotyledons of _PROTEIN_ gus implying that the activitiy of the _PROTEIN_ promoter is independent from light . to check for the stress responsiveness of oscest and _PROTEIN_ rice and arabidopsis seedlings grown on an agar medium were treated with nacl mannitol pq heat and cold stresses and the transcription levels of _PROTEIN_ were measured by quantitative rt pcr . however no drastic change was detected in the _PROTEIN_ level of _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ analyses using published microarray datasets for rice _PROTEIN_ and arabidopsis support the lack of the drastic induction of oscest and _PROTEIN_ under stress conditions . the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ was examined by transient _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ fused _PROTEIN_ proteins _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in arabidopsis leaf protoplasts . under microscopic observation _METHOD_ signals of _METHOD_ from oscest _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ proteins were detected as dot like structures . these signals were consistent with those of chlorophyll _METHOD_ indicating that _PROTEIN_ is a chloroplast protein . by contrast signals from _METHOD_ proteins were detected in both the _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ but not in chloroplasts . as mentioned above transgenic arabidopsis overexpressing oscest and _PROTEIN_ exhibited improved growth with green cotyledons compared with the wild type when germinated on a salt containing medium . to determine whether the enhanced salt tolerance was restricted to the germination stage seedlings grown on a normal medium for d were transferred to mm nacl containing media for d. four days after retransfer to the normal medium transgenic plants overexpressing _PROTEIN_ showed markedly higher survival rates than the control plants . it should be noted that this salt stress assay requires light because wild type plants never showed chlorosis and lethality when incubated in the dark during the salinity stress treatment and recovery . salinity stress often causes oxidative damage through the production of ros . as a marker of oxidative damage under high salinity stress lipid peroxidation was measured by the tbars assay . on the day of exposure to high salt levels lipid peroxidation estimated from mda was drastically increased in the shoots of the control seedlings . in transgenic plants overexpressing _PROTEIN_ salt induced increase of mda was considerably lower than that in the control plants . salinity stress frequently suppresses photosynthetic activity . as a marker of photosynthetic activity chlorophyll _METHOD_ was measured by an imaging _PROTEIN_ fluorometer . fv/fm qp and are parameters estimated from chlorophyll _METHOD_ and represent psii activity energy flow between psii and psi and energy transfer within psii respectively . as shown in fig . these parameters of the control plants _PROTEIN_ concomitantly with the concentration of nacl . by comparison the salinity induced _PROTEIN_ of these parameters was suppressed in transgenic plants overexpressing _PROTEIN_ . to reveal whether the improvement in the stress tolerance conferred by _PROTEIN_ is limited to salt stress the tolerance of the transgenic lines overexpressing _PROTEIN_ to other environmental stresses was tested . first the tolerance of soil grown plants to drought stress was examined . under drought conditions induced by withholding the water supply for d the control plants appeared to have almost wilted whereas the transgenic plants overexpressing _PROTEIN_ genes were visibly healthier . twelve days after resuming water supply the survival rate of _PROTEIN_ overexpressing transgenic plants was considerably higher than that of the control plants . the tolerance to high temperature stress was also tested . seven day old plants grown on agar medium under continuous light at were subjected to . as shown in fig . the number of green leaves in _PROTEIN_ overexpressing transgenic plants was higher than that in control plants . students t test showed that the change in the _PROTEIN_ in the chlorophyll contents was significant in transgenic plants overexpressing _PROTEIN_ over the entire period . to evaluate the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ overexpressing plants to photooxidative stress tolerance to pq was examined . under light pq is photoreduced to pq radicals in psi in the chloroplast _LOCATION_ and then the autooxidation of the pq radicals generates superoxide and its derivative . seedlings grown on a normal medium for d were transferred to pq containing media for d. after exposure to pq for d the transgenic plants overexpressing _PROTEIN_ showed markedly higher survival rates than the control plants . because transferred dna or transposon insertional mutants could not be found in the database of the arabidopsis biological resource centre transgenic arabidopsis with reduced _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ were constructed by the double stranded rna interference technology . a total of seedlings with hygromycin resistance were generated . a majority of them showed severe growth retardation and reduction of green pigmentation of cotyledons and plants were finally dead or sterile compared with the or more of the vector control plants that grew normally . this result suggests that _PROTEIN_ is an essential gene . the phenotypes of the remaining survivors rnai lines no . and no . at the generation were shown in fig . . rnai lines no . and no . had _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ to and respectively and showed growth retardation and low chlorophyll content . the chlorophyll _METHOD_ characteristics represented as fv/fm qp and in rnai lines were significantly lower than those in the control . no apparent _PROTEIN_ was detected in the stress tolerance of rnai lines no . and no . possibly because mutation in these lines was not severe or because a reduction in growth and green pigmentation observed in line no . under normal conditions may have _PROTEIN_ the sensitivity of our assay to detect the susceptibility of the plants to stress . to estimate the effect of light to _PROTEIN_ rnai plants were cultured under dark conditions . no obvious difference was noted in the growth of dark etiolated seedlings between rnai and control plants . when the etiolated seedlings were grown under light conditions cotyledons of control plants turned green within d. in rnai plants however the change in the colour was suppressed and the chlorophyll contents were _PROTEIN_ at lower levels than those of the control plants . the mesophyll cells of these cotyledons were examined under a confocal microscope . as shown in fig . the _METHOD_ signals from chlorophyll in rnai no . lines were weaker than those in the control plants although the number of chloroplasts per cells between rnai no . and control plants were similar . the fine structures of the chloroplasts were studied using an electron microscope . as shown in fig . the chloroplasts of rnai no . plants showed poorly developed _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and grana stacks and the absence of starch grains . these findings indicate that reduced _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ affects light induced chloroplast development .
