arabidopsis thaliana contains a large number of genes that encode _PROTEIN_ acid activating enzymes including nine long chain fatty acyl coa synthetases four coumarate coa ligases and like proteins of unknown biochemical function . because of their high structural and sequence similarity with bona fide and their highly hydrophobic putative substrate binding pockets the like proteins _GENE_ and _GENE_ were selected for detailed analysis . following heterologous _PROTEIN_ the purified proteins were subjected to a large scale screen to identify their preferred in vitro substrates . this study uncovered a significant activity of _GENE_ with medium chain fatty acids medium chain fatty acids carrying a phenyl substitution long chain fatty acids as well as the jasmonic acid precursors oxo phytodienoic acid and oxo cyclopentane hexanoic acid . the closest homolog of _GENE_ namely _GENE_ showed high activity with long chain fatty acids and oxo phytodienoic acid the latter representing the most efficiently converted substrate . by using _METHOD_ tagged variants we demonstrated that both like proteins are targeted to leaf _LOCATION_ . collectively these data demonstrate that _GENE_ and _GENE_ have the capacity to contribute to jasmonic acid biosynthesis by initiating the oxidative chain shortening of its precursors .
large scale in vitro substrate analysis of adenylate forming order to identify in vitro substrates of like proteins and other _PROTEIN_ acid activating enzymes operating via an adenylate intermediate we established a sensitive enzyme assay which allows the analysis of a large number of different compounds in parallel . the common feature of all adenylate forming enzymes is the activation of their respective substrates at the expense of _PROTEIN_ . correspondingly we determined _PROTEIN_ consumption in a semi quantitative assay based on luciferase catalyzed light emission in microtiter plate format . to establish and optimize the assay conditions we utilized _PROTEIN_ and the _PROTEIN_ double mutant designated pl . _PROTEIN_ wt efficiently activates coumaric and caffeic acid to the corresponding coa esters but exhibits strongly reduced activity toward ferulic and cinnamic acid whereas the pl mutant readily activates all above mentioned cinnamic acid derivatives because of its larger and more hydrophobic sbp . in contrast both _PROTEIN_ wt and pl are completely inactive toward sinapic acid . the results of the optimized luciferase based assay as described under experimental procedures indeed reflect the known activity profiles of the _PROTEIN_ wt and pl mutant enzymes . essentially the _PROTEIN_ wt enzyme converted more than of the _PROTEIN_ in mixtures containing coumaric and caffeic acid during a reaction period of h whereas the pl mutant depleted _PROTEIN_ in mixtures containing all cinnamic acid derivatives except sinapic acid . based on these results we considered that efficient substrate conversion is indicated by a _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ concentration by more than within a h incubation period . among the more than additional potential substrates tested with _PROTEIN_ wt only propanoic and heptanoic acid were converted with very low efficiency comparable with the poor substrates cinnamic and ferulic acid characterizing _PROTEIN_ as a highly selective enzyme . when applied to commercially available acetyl coa synthetase from yeast the luciferase based assay yielded relative conversion rates of acetic propionic and butyric acids which are consistent with the known properties of the enzyme . collectively these results demonstrate that our assay reliably reflects the properties and activities of different adenylate forming enzymes . it is noteworthy that only a small aliquot of the reaction mixture was transferred to the luciferase and luciferin containing buffer and that the determination of light emission was limited to the short period of s. this experimental setup allowed the free variation of assay conditions for the adenylate forming enzyme to be analyzed while largely eliminating any interference of assay components on the luciferase catalyzed reaction . this was an important consideration because firefly luciferase has been demonstrated recently to have the intrinsic capacity to activate long chain fatty acids . however conversion of long chain fatty acids was not observed in control reactions e.g . with test enzymes omitted from the assays . structural features of like genes and proteins from a. analyses revealed that the superfamily of adenylate forming enzymes present in arabidopsis segregates into distinct clades clearly separating the functionally identified and lacs enzymes . nevertheless striking similarities were apparent between neighboring clades for example when comparing the structures of the arabidopsis genes with their closest homologs genes encoding like proteins which were previously designated as group b enzymes . although the number and size of introns found in genes vary their relative positions are conserved i.e . three introns are found at identical positions in all four genes whereas and contain one and three additional introns respectively . genes encoding like proteins contain a similar number of introns and most importantly these are exclusively located at the same relative positions as in genes with the exception of _GENE_ which carries two introns at unique sites near its end . the genes encoding _GENE_ _GENE_ and _GENE_ show the greatest structural similarity with the four genes . by contrast no obvious correlation of number and position of introns could be observed between the arabidopsis and lacs genes . based on the high sequence identity between arabidopsis and like proteins which ranges from to and based on the strictly co linear order of highly conserved domains in both groups of enzymes we considered it reasonable to apply the previously identified amino acid residues comprising the substrate specificity code to the group b proteins . we identified corresponding amino acids from multiple sequence alignments and although it was not experimentally established that these residues indeed form the sbps of like proteins we nonetheless expected to obtain hints for possible substrate preferences by this approach . in fig . the phylogenetic relationship between arabidopsis and like proteins is correlated with the properties of the putative sbp lining amino acid residues . two apparent and verifiable predictions arise from this analysis . first none of the like proteins carries a charged residue at position which in _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ a hydrogen bond with the hydroxy group of coumaric acid and correspondingly none of the like proteins is expected to activate hydroxycinnamic acid derivatives . second the putative sbps of two closely related proteins _GENE_ and _GENE_ are exclusively made up of hydrophobic amino acids and are therefore expected to preferentially bind hydrophobic substrates . we have demonstrated previously that by increasing the hydrophobicity of its sbp _PROTEIN_ can be converted to a cinnamic acid activating enzyme and therefore we hypothesized that a like protein with a hydrophobic sbp may represent a cinnamate coa ligase . two like proteins function as fatty acyl coa verify the hypothesis cdnas of both _GENE_ and _GENE_ were cloned from arabidopsis total leaf mrna the encoded proteins were _PROTEIN_ as hexahistidine tagged fusions in e. coli and the soluble proteins were purified to apparent homogeneity by affinity chromatography under native conditions . when tested in the standard photometric assay which records the specific absorption of the formed coa esters no conversion of cinnamic acid or any of its derivatives was detectable with either protein suggesting that sbp hydrophobicity and high sequence similarity with are insufficient criteria for cinnamic acid binding and activation . to identify true in vitro substrates of _GENE_ and _GENE_ we applied the luciferase based screening assay with more than candidate substrates comprising cinnamic benzoic amino and fatty acid derivatives . from the results presented in table i it is obvious that both proteins have the capacity to activate hydrophobic substrates . specifically _GENE_ was active with phenyl butanoic and phenyl pentanoic acid but derivatives having either shorter side chains e.g . phenyl propanoic phenyl acetic and benzoic acid or containing additional _PROTEIN_ groups e.g . butanoic acid were not converted . the most efficiently activated substrates however were the medium chain fatty acids hexanoic and heptanoic acid as well as the long chain fatty acids tetradecanoic hexadecanoic and octadecanoic acid whereas fatty acids of intermediate chain length were activated only with markedly reduced efficiency . subsequent detailed kinetic analyses revealed that this unusual discontinuous chain length specificity with two apparent activity maxima is because of substrate inhibition by the corresponding to fatty acids at the concentration applied in the luciferase based activity assay . _GENE_ in comparison to _GENE_ preferentially activated fatty acids with increased chain length and thus shares characteristics with long chain fatty acyl coa synthetases whereas short chain fatty acids up to a chain length of as well as phenyl substituted fatty acids were converted either poorly or not at all . _GENE_ and _GENE_ have the capacity to contribute to ja _GENE_ and _GENE_ can convert medium and long chain fatty acids we were intrigued by the capacity of at least _GENE_ to also activate fatty acids carrying a bulky phenyl substitution and the _PROTEIN_ that both proteins carry putative peroxisomal targeting signals of type _PROTEIN_ at their c termini . it is assumed that peroxisomal enzymes are responsible for the conversion of iba to iaa as well as opda to ja and that both pathways include oxidation steps which in analogy to fatty acid oxidation should include an activation step of the precursor to the corresponding coa ester . based on these considerations we extend our substrate screen . neither _GENE_ nor _GENE_ catalyzed an appreciable conversion of indole butyric acid indole propanoic acid or iaa indicating that both enzymes do not participate in auxin biosynthesis or metabolism . in contrast ja precursors were activated by both enzymes albeit with different efficiencies . the preferred substrate of _GENE_ was opc whereas _GENE_ converted opda most efficiently which in turn was only a poor substrate for _GENE_ . thus the apparent preference of _GENE_ for substrates with shorter chain length as observed with fatty acids obviously extends to ja precursors . in view of the _PROTEIN_ that opda and opc represent rather unusual substrates for acyl coa synthetases and enzymes catalyzing their activation have not previously been described we wanted to demonstrate unequivocally that the ultimate reaction products are indeed coa esters and exclude the possibility that the reaction stops at the level of adenylate formation . enzymes that function solely as long chain fatty acyl amp ligases and have no intrinsic capacity to form a coa ester end product have recently been identified in mycobacterium tuberculosis . therefore we determined the chemical nature of the reaction products formed from opda by _GENE_ by using _METHOD_ _METHOD_ operating in negative ion mode . the molecular _METHOD_ of the product ions m/z and were identical within the experimental _LOCATION_ to the calculated _METHOD_ of singly and doubly deprotonated opda coa . both product ions were selected for fragmentation and in the corresponding _METHOD_ spectra the majority of ions could be assigned to typical fragments of phosphoadenosine containing compounds and fragments containing opda . corresponding results were obtained with opc hexanoic and nonanoic acid upon incubation with _GENE_ . in conclusion compelling evidence was provided that both enzymes _GENE_ and _GENE_ catalyze the conversion of their substrates to the coa esters . catalytic efficiency of _GENE_ and _GENE_ enzymes accepting multiple substrates critical assessment of substrate specificity and utilization required detailed kinetic parameters . to establish such data we applied a quantitative photometric assay which couples the rate of amp formation by adenylate forming enzymes to nadh oxidation via the auxiliary enzymes myokinase pyruvate kinase and lactate dehydrogenase . for both like proteins the kinetic parameters were determined for two medium chain and one long chain fatty acid as well as for the ja precursors opda and opc . from the data in table iii it is evident that _GENE_ functions as fatty acyl coa synthetase with a preference for substrates of medium chain length . with a kcat/km value of nonanoic acid represents the most efficiently converted substrate but hexanoic and tetradecanoic acid were also converted with appreciable efficiency . both opda and opc have comparable but significantly lower kcat/km values than the fatty acids used in this analysis . in the case of _GENE_ the efficiency of fatty acid activation increases continuously with their chain length with kcat/km values of and for hexanoic nonanoic and tetradecanoic acid respectively resulting in a preliminary classification of this enzyme as lacs . in _PROTEIN_ the activity of both _GENE_ as well as _GENE_ with long chain fatty acids compares favorably with those of other lacs enzymes of plant origin . however the low km of and the high kcat/km value of determined for opda justify the classification of _GENE_ as a bona fide opda coa ligase . in contrast to _GENE_ the activity of _GENE_ with opc was too low to allow a reliable determination of kinetic parameters . in agreement with the data presented in table i activation of fatty acids by _PROTEIN_ was not detectable . _PROTEIN_ level and subcellular localization of _GENE_ and _GENE_ ja is synthesized from opda or dinor opda in _LOCATION_ enzymes contributing to this conversion must be _PROTEIN_ at reasonable levels and targeted to this organelle . to verify whether or not _GENE_ and _GENE_ fulfil both of these criteria we analyzed their _PROTEIN_ and subcellular localization . steady state mrna levels of _GENE_ and _GENE_ in arabidopsis leaves were considerably higher than those of all other members of group b proteins except _GENE_ and reaching of the _PROTEIN_ level exhibited by _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ has been shown previously to represent the most abundant isoform in leaves . although mrna levels need not necessarily correlate with protein abundance we conclude that _GENE_ and _GENE_ are presumably of functional importance . the _PROTEIN_ of _GENE_ and _GENE_ in other plant organs was determined by semi quantitative rt pcr . the results revealed that both genes are co _PROTEIN_ and that leaves _METHOD_ and flowers contained comparable mrna amounts whereas those in roots and siliques were significantly lower . it its known that jasmonates induce the _PROTEIN_ of genes encoding enzymes of ja biosynthesis such as lipoxygenase allene oxide synthase allene oxide cyclase and opr . to explore whether _GENE_ and _GENE_ are also part of this proposed positive feedback regulatory system we analyzed their _PROTEIN_ in cultured arabidopsis cells in response to meja treatment . as is obvious from fig . the amount of _GENE_ mrna increased strongly and transiently under these conditions although with a delay in comparison to allene oxide synthase mrna accumulation whereas the _PROTEIN_ _GENE_ was not affected by meja treatment . when inspecting the n terminal regions of _GENE_ and _GENE_ for subcellular targeting signal sequences no such peptide motifs were identified . however both proteins possess major peroxisomal targeting signals of type _PROTEIN_ at their c termini . to demonstrate that the c terminal tripeptides present in _GENE_ and _GENE_ in _PROTEIN_ target their enzymes to _LOCATION_ we constructed fusion proteins containing spectral variants of the green _METHOD_ protein and used these for transient _PROTEIN_ and double labeling experiments . _METHOD_ extended by the canonical major _PROTEIN_ tripeptide _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was used as peroxisomal marker protein because a corresponding green _METHOD_ protein variant has been shown previously to be successfully targeted to the organelle in yeast mammalian and plant cells . the complete coding sequences of _GENE_ or _GENE_ were fused to the c terminus of _METHOD_ and all constructs placed under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus promoter . for co localization studies arabidopsis leaves were biolistically transformed with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _GENE_ or _METHOD_ _GENE_ and after a h post bombardment period single cells inspected by confocal laser scanning microscopy . transformed cells showed a punctate labeling pattern which is characteristic for _LOCATION_ . the complete three dimensional co localization of yellow and red _METHOD_ originating from _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _GENE_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ respectively provides compelling evidence that both _GENE_ and _GENE_ are localized in _LOCATION_ i.e . in the organelle that is responsible for fatty acid oxidation and the final steps of ja biosynthesis .
isolation and cloning of _GENE_ and _GENE_ cdnas of _GENE_ and _GENE_ were amplified by rt pcr from a. thaliana total rna . synthesis of the cdnas and subsequent pcr amplification of the full length reading frames was performed with the one tube rt pcr kit according to the manufacturer 's instructions with the primer pair _GENE_ fi and ri _PROTEIN_ and the primer pair _GENE_ fi and ri _PROTEIN_ respectively . the resulting cdnas were used as templates for a second round of pcr amplification using the primer pair _GENE_ fii and rii _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and the primer pair _GENE_ fii and rii _PROTEIN_ respectively . in the case of _GENE_ this second pcr amplification was used to introduce the sphi and sali sites required for cloning into the _PROTEIN_ vector . in case of _GENE_ bamhi and sali sites were introduced in the second round of pcr amplification and the resulting product was cloned into the _PROTEIN_ plasmid . the dna sequences of all isolated clones were determined by the adis service unit on abi dna sequencers _METHOD_ by using bigdye terminator chemistry and were found to be identical with the sequences available from the mips data base . heterologous _PROTEIN_ and purification of _GENE_ and _GENE_ and purification of _GENE_ and _GENE_ were essentially carried out as described previously for _PROTEIN_ with the exception that the _PROTEIN_ plasmids were introduced into the escherichia coli strain carrying the repressor plasmid and that the growth temperature was reduced to . the purity of the enzymes was inspected by _PROTEIN_ gel electrophoresis .

luminometer and _PROTEIN_ as relative luciferase activity which is directly proportional to _PROTEIN_ concentration . to minimize the variability of the assay all _PROTEIN_ determinations were normalized to a reaction containing _PROTEIN_ and sinapic acid in which no _PROTEIN_ depletion occurred and correspondingly was set to . time course experiments using _PROTEIN_ showed that good substrates resulted in significant _PROTEIN_ depletion within h . therefore an incubation period of h was chosen for the large scale screen . coupled enzyme assay of acyl coa detailed kinetic analyses

and lactate dehydrogenase _PROTEIN_ from ziegler et al . . the reaction mixture contained m tris hcl mm dithioerythritol mm _PROTEIN_ mm m coa mm nadh mm phosphoenolpyruvate nanokatal of myokinase

enzyme and the oxidation of mol of nadh per mol of substrate activated was followed at nm . km and vmax values were obtained by linear regression of v/s against s from at least three independent experiments . transient _PROTEIN_ and subcellular localization of _GENE_ and _GENE_ in _GENE_ and _GENE_ cdnas were pcr amplified using the primer pair and and the primer pair and respectively thereby making the pcr products compatible with the cloning system . both modified cdnas were inserted into the gateway donor vector by homologous recombination according to the manufacturer 's instructions . the resulting plasmids were used to transfer both coding sequences into the _PROTEIN_ vector _METHOD_ which is based on pxcs and was kindly provided by dr. n. medina escobar leading to n terminal fusions of _METHOD_ to _GENE_ and _GENE_ . to serve as peroxisomal marker the red _METHOD_ protein dsred _METHOD_ with the peroxisomal import sequence _PROTEIN_ fused to its c terminus _PROTEIN_ was cloned via hindiii and ecori restriction sites into the plant binary _PROTEIN_ vector pampat mcs . all newly designed vectors allowed the in planta _PROTEIN_ of proteins under the control of the
