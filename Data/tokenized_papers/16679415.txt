signaling through heterotrimeric g proteins is conserved in diverse eukaryotes . compared to vertebrates the simpler repertoire of g protein complex and accessory components in arabidopsis offers a unique advantage over all other multicellular genetic model _METHOD_ for dissecting the mechanism of g protein signal transduction . one of several biological processes that the g protein complex regulates in arabidopsis is cell division . we determined cell production rate in the primary root and the formation of _PROTEIN_ roots in arabidopsis to define individually the types of modulatory roles of the respective g protein and subunits as well as the heterotrimer in cell division . the growth rate of the root is in part a consequence of cell cycle _PROTEIN_ in the root apical meristem while _PROTEIN_ root production requires meristem formation by founder pericycle cells . thus a comparison of these two parameters in various genetic backgrounds enabled dissection of the role of the g protein subunits in modulation of cell division both in _PROTEIN_ and initiation . cell production rates were determined for the ram and _PROTEIN_ root formation in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ single and double mutants and in transgenic lines overexpressing _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ mutant backgrounds respectively . we found in the ram that the heterotrimeric complex acts as an attenuator of cell proliferation whereas the _PROTEIN_ bound form of the subunit 's role is a positive modulator . in contrast for the formation of _PROTEIN_ roots the dimer acts largely independently of the subunit to attenuate cell division . these results suggest that arabidopsis heterotrimeric g protein subunits have differential and opposing roles in the modulation of cell division in roots .
the results of quantitative real time pcr and immunoblot analyses indicated that both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are more strongly _PROTEIN_ in roots than in shoots in young seedlings . using arabidopsis suspension cells _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ cyan _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ or yellow _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ we found that the fusion proteins are preferentially distributed at the cell plate in newly divided cells suggesting a role in cytokinesis . recently studies in both invertebrates and vertebrates have revealed an essential function of the heterotrimeric g proteins in positioning of the mitotic spindle and attaching microtubules to the cell cortex which is distinct from their well studied role in signal transduction downstream of seven transmembrane receptors . to address the molecular mechanism by which the heterotrimeric g protein complex regulates plant cell proliferation we chose to examine cell division in roots an organ where this growth parameter can be dissected both spatially and temporally within a multicellular context . the morphological differences observed between wild type and _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ plants were ascribed to differences in cell proliferation rate and not histogenesis . we show that root growth rate in _PROTEIN_ mutants was greater than columbia wild type whereas _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants have wild type root growth rate . root growth rate combines the rate at which the ram produces cell derivatives that are recruited into the distal root and the rate at which these derivatives subsequently elongate . however it is possible to indirectly calculate both parameters . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutants had more and fewer _PROTEIN_ roots respectively . the formation of a _PROTEIN_ root requires an initiation of division of one pericycle cell arguably at the _PROTEIN_ transition . therefore the number of _PROTEIN_ roots indicates the number of cell cycle entry events . we determined both the rate of cell production in the primary ram and the number of _PROTEIN_ roots to pinpoint the role of g protein subunits in cell division in two different root cell types and compared and contrasted them . for clarity data on only one allele of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ single mutants and one allele of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ are presented . these same single mutant alleles were used to generate the double and triple mutant combinations with _PROTEIN_ or with _PROTEIN_ . data on the second allele of the _PROTEIN_ single mutant _PROTEIN_ and the second allele of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ are identical to those of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ respectively . the _PROTEIN_ allele is a point mutation mutant that behaved differently from _PROTEIN_ mutant in the primary root growth assay though it behaved similarly to _PROTEIN_ in the _PROTEIN_ root formation assay implying that it is not a null allele or that additional mutations are present . consistent with this we detected a larger _PROTEIN_ transcript in _PROTEIN_ mutants . because _PROTEIN_ was shown to be transcript null and because a _PROTEIN_ construct completely rescued the _PROTEIN_ mutant phenotype only the _PROTEIN_ mutant was used for this study . rates of cell production in the primary root of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants and transgenic lines overexpressing _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ root elongation rate and cortical root cell length were collected from at least seedlings . se is indicated . pairwise student 's t test was used to compare values to the control . significant highly significant . _PROTEIN_ root numbers of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants and transgenic lines overexpressing _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ roots were counted from d old light grown seedlings . shown are the average numbers of _PROTEIN_ roots from at least seedlings with associated se . pairwise student 's t test was used to compare values to the control . significant highly significant . combination of the two loss of function alleles _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ conferred longer primary roots and more _PROTEIN_ root phenotypes similar to the _PROTEIN_ mutant allele acting alone . this genetic relationship was also the case for auxin induced adventitious root formation in hypocotyls . while the focus of this study is on cell division in the root for completeness sake we examined non root phenotypes of g protein mutants and found that for all scorable traits the _PROTEIN_ mutant allele was epistatic to the _PROTEIN_ allele . if g protein coupled signaling in arabidopsis follows the mechanism of action established in animal _METHOD_ a comparison of the phenotypes of these single and double mutants permits prediction of which subunit namely the activated the dimer and/or the heterotrimeric complex facilitates the primary signal transduction leading to root growth and _PROTEIN_ root formation . for example because activation of the subunit leads to release of the dimer opposite phenotypes such as _PROTEIN_ root formation for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ null mutations are generally interpreted to mean that the subunit is the predominant form regulating pericycle cell division . because the dimer is required for proper coupling of to its receptor in animal cells phenotypes that are similar in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants are generally interpreted to mean that either the subunit is the predominant active form or that the heterotrimeric complex is signaling . because _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ form a molecular complex mechanistic interpretations of epistasis relationships are precarious . therefore to address these issues we overexpressed _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ mutant backgrounds respectively . this enabled us to dissect the individual roles of and g protein subunits as well as the heterotrimer in root cell proliferation . for example we reasoned that a phenotype from overexpression of _PROTEIN_ in the absence of _PROTEIN_ precludes the interpretation of _PROTEIN_ sequestration . similarly overexpression of _PROTEIN_ in the absence of _PROTEIN_ enables a direct test of an individual _PROTEIN_ role in root cell proliferation because _PROTEIN_ is no longer available for recruitment by _PROTEIN_ to form the heterotrimer . the _PROTEIN_ levels of _PROTEIN_ protein in transgenic lines were examined by immunoblot analysis using antibodies directed against the c terminus of _PROTEIN_ . because an exhausted attempt to make specific antibodies to the arabidopsis subunit failed _PROTEIN_ transcript levels were measured by quantitative real time pcr as an indirect assessment of _PROTEIN_ levels in overexpressing lines . based on the _PROTEIN_ protein levels in transgenic lines overexpressing _PROTEIN_ and the _PROTEIN_ transcript levels in transgenic lines overexpressing _PROTEIN_ two independent transgenic lines were chosen from each transformation for subsequent analyses of root cell division . these independent transgenic lines are designated by parentheses in figure or labeled with line numbers in figure . subsequently the data collected from these two independent transgenic lines were pooled and presented in tables i and ii with corresponding statistical tests . the increased root growth in both _PROTEIN_ single and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutants was due to an increased cell production in the ram . moreover overexpression of _PROTEIN_ confers _PROTEIN_ cell production in the ram demonstrating that the cell production rate in wild type _METHOD_ is not at basal level . the capacity for a lower cell production rate than for the control is a critical point as it enabled us to assign meaning to a no change in rate phenotype observed in the other genotypes overexpressing individual subunits . combining both loss and gain of function results in the wild type background indicated that _PROTEIN_ is an attenuator of cell division in the primary root . we tested if the attenuation of root cell division by _PROTEIN_ requires a functional _PROTEIN_ . we examined overexpression of _PROTEIN_ in the absence of _PROTEIN_ and determined if cell division in the ram is altered . overexpression of _PROTEIN_ in the _PROTEIN_ mutant complemented the primary root phenotype indicating that the transgene is functional . when _PROTEIN_ was overexpressed in _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutant backgrounds no effect on primary root growth was observed indicating that _PROTEIN_ action requires a functional _PROTEIN_ . this suggests that either acts downstream of _PROTEIN_ or that the intact heterotrimeric complex itself acts to modulate cell division in the ram . to distinguish between these two possibilities the reciprocal experiment was performed . we examined overexpression of _PROTEIN_ in the absence of _PROTEIN_ and determined if cell division in the ram is altered . we found that ectopic _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in a background containing _PROTEIN_ reduced cell proliferation . however this _PROTEIN_ in cell proliferation by additional _PROTEIN_ required a functional _PROTEIN_ . these results are consistent with the conclusion that the heterotrimeric state of the g protein complex is required to negatively modulate cell proliferation in the ram . a signaling role for the intact heterotrimeric complex is rare but not unprecedented although this is the first report to our knowledge for a role by the heterotrimer in cell division . we previously identified a protein _PROTEIN_ as the sole regulator of g signaling protein in arabidopsis . _PROTEIN_ contains an rgs domain at its c terminus preferentially binds to the activated form _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ and negatively regulates g protein signaling by accelerating the _PROTEIN_ activity of subunits . loss of function of _PROTEIN_ resulted in increased cell production in the primary root whereas it had no significant effect on _PROTEIN_ root formation . with a single rgs gene in arabidopsis it was possible to increase the pool of the activated _PROTEIN_ form of _PROTEIN_ by disruption of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . as shown in figure an increase in activated conferred a statistically significant increase in cell production in the primary root in the presence of a functional subunit . we further generated double and triple mutants among _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ loss of function mutants to test the genetic interaction between _PROTEIN_ and the heterotrimeric g protein complex genes in the regulation of root cell division by measuring the cell production rate in the primary root and _PROTEIN_ root formation in these double and triple mutants . we found that the stimulatory effect in the _PROTEIN_ mutant was abrogated in the absence of _PROTEIN_ suggesting that _PROTEIN_ acts through _PROTEIN_ to regulate cell division in the primary root . both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants had increased cell production in the primary root but no additive or synergistic effects were observed in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double and triple mutants indicating that _PROTEIN_ acts in the same pathway with the heterotrimeric g protein complex genes . again while the focus here is on root cell proliferation for completeness sake we extended our investigation to aerial phenotypes . for all other scorable traits the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants were epistatic to the _PROTEIN_ allele . previously we proposed a model in which _PROTEIN_ acts downstream of _PROTEIN_ and negatively regulates _PROTEIN_ root formation . here we analyzed _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant and transgenic lines overexpressing _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ mutant backgrounds respectively to test this model . the opposite phenotypes of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ single mutants in _PROTEIN_ root formation permitted a robust epistasis analysis . the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant phenocopied the _PROTEIN_ single mutant _PROTEIN_ root phenotype indicating that the _PROTEIN_ allele is epistatic to _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutants produced fewer _PROTEIN_ roots than the wild type . overexpression of _PROTEIN_ in the _PROTEIN_ mutant restored the number of _PROTEIN_ roots in the mutant to the wild type level indicating that the _PROTEIN_ transgene was functional . we observed an increased number of _PROTEIN_ roots when _PROTEIN_ was overexpressed in the wild type background . however overexpression of _PROTEIN_ in the _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutant backgrounds did not further increase the number of _PROTEIN_ roots of these mutants indicating that _PROTEIN_ acts through _PROTEIN_ . the most likely explanation of this observation is that overexpression of _PROTEIN_ sequesters _PROTEIN_ into the heterotrimeric complex . overexpression of _PROTEIN_ complemented the _PROTEIN_ mutant phenotype of excessive _PROTEIN_ root formation indicating that the _PROTEIN_ transgene was functional . when _PROTEIN_ was overexpressed a _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ root formation was observed compared to the no transgene controls _PROTEIN_ of the presence or absence of _PROTEIN_ . because loss of function of _PROTEIN_ promotes _PROTEIN_ root formation while overexpression of _PROTEIN_ inhibits it we conclude that _PROTEIN_ is a negative modulator of _PROTEIN_ root formation . these results also support the notion that _PROTEIN_ acts downstream of _PROTEIN_ and that _PROTEIN_ can function independently of _PROTEIN_ in regulating _PROTEIN_ root formation . moreover an increase in the activated form of _PROTEIN_ through a loss of function allele of _PROTEIN_ did not affect the _PROTEIN_ root formation either in the wild type background or in the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ single or double mutant backgrounds indicating that the interaction of _PROTEIN_ and the heterotrimeric g protein complex may not be required for the regulation of _PROTEIN_ root formation . taken together the data of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ single and double mutants and of transgenic lines overexpressing _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in different mutant backgrounds support a testable model in which _PROTEIN_ acts downstream of _PROTEIN_ to inhibit _PROTEIN_ root formation .
