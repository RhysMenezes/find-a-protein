the correct localization of integral _LOCATION_ proteins to subcellular compartments is important for their functions . synaptotagmin contains a single transmembrane domain that functions as a type i signal anchor sequence in its n terminus and two calcium binding domains _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in its c terminus . here we demonstrate that the localization of an arabidopsis synaptotagmin homolog _PROTEIN_ to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ is modulated by tandem _PROTEIN_ domains . an analysis of the roots of a transformant _PROTEIN_ green _METHOD_ protein tagged _PROTEIN_ driven by native _PROTEIN_ promoter suggested that _PROTEIN_ is synthesized in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and then delivered to the pm via the exocytotic pathway . we transiently _PROTEIN_ a series of truncated proteins in protoplasts and determined that tandem _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ domains were necessary for the localization of _PROTEIN_ to the pm . the pm localization of _PROTEIN_ was greatly reduced following mutation of the calcium binding motifs of the _PROTEIN_ domain based on sequence comparisons with other homologs such as endomembrane localized _PROTEIN_ . the localization of _PROTEIN_ to the pm may have been required for the functional divergence that occurred in the molecular evolution of plant synaptotagmins .
we generated transgenic arabidopsis plants _PROTEIN_ a fusion protein of _PROTEIN_ with _METHOD_ _METHOD_ from the _PROTEIN_ native promoter . first we investigated the biochemical property of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ using the crude _LOCATION_ fraction and the highly purified pm fraction which were prepared from leaves by means of aqueous two phase partitioning . in wild type plants and control plants _PROTEIN_ only _METHOD_ anti _PROTEIN_ antibody recognized only kda proteins which appeared to be more abundant in the pm fraction than in the crude _LOCATION_ fraction . in plants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ kda proteins were detected in addition to the kda proteins in both the crude _LOCATION_ and pm fractions . in all cases high levels of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ type aquaporin _PROTEIN_ were detected in the pm fractions . in addition the anti _METHOD_ antibody recognized kda proteins in the pm fraction of plants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and kda proteins in both the total and soluble protein fractions of control plants _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . the experimental molecular _METHOD_ of detected _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ correspond to the calculated molecular _METHOD_ of these proteins which are about kda and kda respectively indicating that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion proteins are correctly delivered to the pm in transgenic plants . to further confirm the localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ crude _LOCATION_ fractions were fractionated using the sucrose density gradient centrifugation method . _PROTEIN_ signals were detected in the sucrose fractions of wild type plants with maximum signal intensity approximately at the sucrose fraction in which signals of _PROTEIN_ were detected . also in the transgenic lines fractionation patterns of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ signals were almost identical to those of wild type plants . these data indicate that both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ are localized only to the pm in leaf cells . in addition observation of leaf cells _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ shows that _METHOD_ signals are detected _PROTEIN_ in the epidermis and palisade layers are strong in the vascular bundle and are localized to the edge of cells . interestingly in guard cells the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signal was localized to the pm on the outer edges of stomata . a previous experiment showed that the _PROTEIN_ domain of _PROTEIN_ is located in the _LOCATION_ region . in the current experiment because _METHOD_ was fused to the c terminus of _PROTEIN_ the topology of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ needed to be confirmed . we used the aqueous two phase partitioning system to isolate _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ vesicles . the _PROTEIN_ activities in the fresh pm fractions were evaluated by using the specific _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ type _PROTEIN_ inhibitor vanadate in the presence and absence of triton x . the fresh pm fractions prepared in our system contained right side out pm vesicles . fresh pm fractions prepared from wild type plants or the transgenic lines were treated with thermolysin in the presence or absence of triton x . the greater the amount of thermolysin applied with triton x the weaker the signal of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ detected . however the application of thermolysin without triton x did not affect the intensity of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signals . the signal pattern resulting from thermolysin digestion in the presence or absence of triton x was similar to that of _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ type h _PROTEIN_ which were recognized by anti _PROTEIN_ antibody raised against the c terminal _LOCATION_ region . these results indicate that the topology of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ is the same as that of _PROTEIN_ and that the _METHOD_ tag was located in the _LOCATION_ region of the cell . this is because the fresh pm fraction purified by aqueous two phase partitioning includes much of the right side out pm vesicle and consequently the portions of proteins located at the inside of vesicles are protected from protease degradation . in addition _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were not solubilized when the crude _LOCATION_ fraction was subjected to alkaline treatment . these results collectively suggest that both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ are integrated in the pm and that two _PROTEIN_ domains are located in the cytoplasm of arabidopsis leaf cells . in roots the _METHOD_ signal was strong in the root tip especially in the quiescent center columella and epidermis and vascular bundle as well as in the differential zone of the tips of root hairs . then we observed the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in detail . in division and elongation zones the _METHOD_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was localized not only to the pm but also to structures such as the rough _LOCATION_ that surrounded the _LOCATION_ and extended to the cell surface . to visualize the pm root cells were stained with an impermeable lipid _LOCATION_ specific _METHOD_ dye which is only taken up into cells via endocytosis and labels the early endosomes and tgn in plants . although the pattern of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was almost identical to that of labeled pm vesicles labeled with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ did not overlap with labeled endosomes . in dividing cells _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was localized to the cell plate . in the differentiation zone _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ in the epidermis showed that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was not uniformly distributed on the pm and seemed to be associated with some microfibers and accumulated in the tips of root hairs . after roots were treated with bfa which is an inhibitor of the endocytotic pathway in plant cells several endosomes labeled with in the epidermal cells of the elongation zone resulted in large vesicular structures which are referred to as the bfa compartment . these structures only partially overlapped with vesicles labeled with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ is targeted to the pm through the exocytosis pathway but tends to be retained in the pm without being removed via the endocytotic recycling pathway . next we tested the contribution of the domain structures of _PROTEIN_ for its subcellular localization . plant syt proteins consist of four domains a single tm domain following a few amino acid residues in the n terminus one smp domain which is conserved in plants and two calcium binding domains _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in the c terminus . interestingly the smp domain is also conserved in the novel mammal syt family proteins of e syts . on the basis of this domain information seven constructs _PROTEIN_ truncated proteins of _PROTEIN_ with _METHOD_ in the c terminus were designed and introduced into protoplasts isolated from leaves . full length _PROTEIN_ was found to be _PROTEIN_ but not uniformly located in the pm of transformed protoplasts . in addition in this protoplast system some of the full length _PROTEIN_ proteins seemed to be localized to vesicles such as the _LOCATION_ or the tgn . the localization pattern of truncated _PROTEIN_ proteins containing tandem _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and smp domains was very similar to that of full length _PROTEIN_ . in contrast the truncated proteins containing only the tandem _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ domains were localized to vesicles such as the _LOCATION_ or tgn but not to the pm . in addition the proteins containing only the _PROTEIN_ domain seemed to disperse into the cytoplasm . these results suggest that the appropriate localization of _PROTEIN_ to the pm is determined by the tandem _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and smp domains . the truncated proteins containing only the putative tm domain were observed in the cytoplasm but not in any _LOCATION_ system . however the truncated proteins containing both the tm domain and the smp domain were localized to vesicles but not to the pm . furthermore the truncated proteins containing tm smp and _PROTEIN_ domains localized to several compartments but not to the pm . next to analyze the localization of _METHOD_ labeled truncated _PROTEIN_ proteins containing tm smp or _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ domains each construct was transfected into protoplasts isolated from the wild type plant or a transgenic plant _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ labeled _LOCATION_ marker proteins and the former protoplasts were stained with _LOCATION_ tracker to visualize the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . the colocalization of _METHOD_ labeled proteins was evaluated using pearson 's correlation . full length _PROTEIN_ proteins tagged with _METHOD_ partially colocalized with _METHOD_ tagged _LOCATION_ marker proteins . in contrast the localization of truncated proteins containing tandem _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ domains was strongly correlated with that of _LOCATION_ marker proteins . the truncated proteins containing tm smp domains partially colocalized with _LOCATION_ marker proteins . in the case of _LOCATION_ tracker _METHOD_ was observed not only on network like structures but also on vesicles . _METHOD_ _METHOD_ associated with full length _PROTEIN_ slightly overlapped with _LOCATION_ tracker _METHOD_ . in contrast _METHOD_ _METHOD_ associated with tm smp partially overlapped with network like structures or vesicles stained with _LOCATION_ tracker . a transient _PROTEIN_ assay indicated the importance of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ domain in the pm localization of _PROTEIN_ . in the arabidopsis data base there are five syt genes that contain only two _PROTEIN_ domains and these genes may share a common ancestral gene because the exon intron structures are highly conserved among the syt genes . from this result we concluded that the pm localization of _PROTEIN_ was responsible for the functional divergence among arabidopsis syts . to deduce their evolutionary relationship we next identified syt genes containing two _PROTEIN_ domains from the available genomic databases of seven angiosperm plants . although arabidopsis syt genes have been termed syt in the phylogenetic experiments they were practically renamed atsyt and similarly the two letter species indicators were used to distinguish between the other plant syt genes . at least four copies of the syt genes have been retained in each of the plant genomes examined . we did not use to perform phylogenetic analyses because the nucleotide sequence of includes a stop codon in its coding sequence . in plant syt genes the four domain structures described above were conserved and the most highly conserved region was found in the region of the tandem _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ domains . the amino acid sequences surrounding the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ domains and the smp domain were aligned with the clustalw program and then corresponding nucleotide sequences were used to reconstruct a phylogenetic tree based on the neighbor joining method . the constructed phylogenetic tree indicates that angiosperm syt genes had clearly diverged into three clades _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and that the _PROTEIN_ clade was more closely related to the _PROTEIN_ clade than to the _PROTEIN_ clade . each clade contains syt genes of both monocots and eudicots . although the clade of _PROTEIN_ contained three sister groups and two closely related groups of these were eudicots the other one comprised monocots . the clade of _PROTEIN_ contained a monocotyledonous group and a eudicotyledonous group . similarly to _PROTEIN_ clade _PROTEIN_ clade also contained two closely related groups of which were eudicots but the other one comprised monocots . the four arabidopsis syt genes separated into two clades and and and were classified into the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ clades respectively . next we compared the amino acid sequences of the _PROTEIN_ domains encoded by the four syt genes . fig . is a diagrammatic representation of the _PROTEIN_ domain of _PROTEIN_ according to the prediction of strands and loops of synaptotagmin related proteins including plant syts by and davletov . two loop structures between the first and second strands and between the third and fourth strands are referred to as loops and respectively . multiple alignments among plant syts show that the _PROTEIN_ domains in the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ clades lack conserved motifs in loops and which are required for the direct interaction with calcium and _LOCATION_ lipids . although loop of the _PROTEIN_ domain of syt generally has a conserved motif motif in the _PROTEIN_ domain of arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ the first aspartic acid of is substituted with histidine and three amino acid residues including are missing . although loop of the _PROTEIN_ domain also generally contains a conserved motif the first two aspartic acid residues and the last aspartic acid residue are substituted with serine and glutamic acid respectively in the _PROTEIN_ domain of arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ . therefore the _PROTEIN_ domains of arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ and of the other plant syts in the _PROTEIN_ clade completely lacked the calcium binding motifs . phylogenetic analysis of plant syt genes and comparison of the amino acid residues of the _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ domains suggest that the evolutionary change in the calcium binding motifs of the _PROTEIN_ domain of the _PROTEIN_ clade may have occurred after the differentiation of syt genes into the three clades and may have resulted in the localization of _PROTEIN_ to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ in plants . to test the hypothesis that the localization of _PROTEIN_ is affected by the loss of the conserved motifs of loop and loop in the _PROTEIN_ domain we performed a transient _PROTEIN_ assay . the localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was compared with that of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ which possessed the conserved motifs in loop and loop or with the localization of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ mutants in which the amino acid residues of loop and/or loop were exchanged to those of _PROTEIN_ . although _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was localized to the pm and to some endomembranes _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was localized only to endomembranes . interestingly the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ mutants which has loop or both loop and loop were localized almost completely to endomembranes strongly resembling the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ localization but small amounts also localized to the pm . however there was no difference between _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and the mutant that only contains loop . moreover almost all of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ mutants containing both loop and loop colocalized with _METHOD_ labeled _LOCATION_ marker proteins . these results suggest that the localization of _PROTEIN_ is determined by the biochemical property of the _PROTEIN_ domain .
