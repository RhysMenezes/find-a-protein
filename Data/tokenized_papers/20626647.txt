a central question in cell biology is how the identity of organelles is established and _PROTEIN_ . here we report on _PROTEIN_ an _METHOD_ mutant identified through a screen for partial displacement of the _LOCATION_ marker _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ to other organelles . _PROTEIN_ showed partial distribution of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ into a modified _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ network which formed bulges and large skein like structures entangling _LOCATION_ stacks . _PROTEIN_ showed defects in _LOCATION_ protein export as evidenced by our observations that besides the partial retention of _LOCATION_ markers in the _LOCATION_ the trafficking of a soluble bulk flow marker to the cell surface was also compromised . using a combination of classical mapping and next generation dna sequencing approaches we linked the mutant phenotype to a missense mutation of a proline residue in position to a leucine residue in a small endomembrane protein encoded by the _PROTEIN_ locus . subcellular localization analyses indicated that _PROTEIN_ is a _LOCATION_ protein and that its mutated form is retained in the _LOCATION_ . interestingly also a _PROTEIN_ knock out mutant mirrored the _PROTEIN_ subcellular phenotype . these data indicate that _PROTEIN_ is a protein destined to post _LOCATION_ compartments and suggest that its export from the _LOCATION_ is a requirement to ensure steady state _PROTEIN_ of the organelle s organization and functional activity in relation to other secretory compartments . we speculate that _PROTEIN_ may be a _PROTEIN_ that is necessary for _LOCATION_ integrity because of its ability to limit deleterious effects of other secretory proteins on the _LOCATION_ .
in a microscope based screen of cotyledons of week old arabidopsis seedlings for altered subcellular distribution of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ a well established trans _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ marker we isolated _PROTEIN_ a mutant with an _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signal distributed to the _LOCATION_ and an underlying network . the network defined unusual structures in epidermal cells compare movie and movie . generally in the mid to lower sections of each cell we found one large globular structure that contained _LOCATION_ stacks and that was distinguishable from the _LOCATION_ and also smaller circular structures at the cell s periphery movie . both types of structures were highly motile . as evidenced by treatment with the general plant endomembrane dye the phenotype was present also in segregating plants of the mapping population from crosses of the _PROTEIN_ mutant with arabidopsis thaliana landsberg _LOCATION_ ecotype that did not _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ thereby excluding the possibility that the phenotype was due to over _PROTEIN_ of the transgene . analyses of _PROTEIN_ cotyledon epidermal cells stably _PROTEIN_ g yk a cis _LOCATION_ marker showed that the _METHOD_ pattern of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ overlapped that of g yk indicating an abnormal distribution of another _LOCATION_ marker of earlier cisternae than the trans _LOCATION_ in _PROTEIN_ and excluding the possibility that the partial redistribution of a _LOCATION_ marker was specific to _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and trans _LOCATION_ proteins . because the membranous network highlighted by the _LOCATION_ markers in the _PROTEIN_ mutant background resembled that of the _LOCATION_ we analyzed _PROTEIN_ cotyledons _PROTEIN_ the _LOCATION_ lumenal marker _LOCATION_ yk . confocal microscope analyses confirmed that the network was indeed _LOCATION_ and thus that in the _PROTEIN_ mutant the _LOCATION_ markers are partially redistributed to this organelle . the imaging of the smaller circular _PROTEIN_ structures indicated that they were part of the _LOCATION_ network we aimed to test whether the larger globular structures were in continuity with the _LOCATION_ or formed an isolated compartment . to this end we photobleached the _LOCATION_ yk _METHOD_ in the large globular structure and followed its recovery over time . as shown in figure _LOCATION_ yk photobleaching was followed by _METHOD_ recovery albeit to a much slower recovery rate than previously described for lumenal _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ indicating not only that the large globular structures did not form a separate compartment from the general _LOCATION_ but also suggesting that the defects in _LOCATION_ organization may limit diffusion of proteins in this organelle . the obvious defects in _LOCATION_ morphology raised the question whether the _LOCATION_ export activities of this organelle would also be compromised . the evidence that two _LOCATION_ markers were partially distributed to the _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ suggested defects in _LOCATION_ protein export . to test this possibility we aimed to establish the distribution of a bulk flow reporter such as a soluble marker destined to the apoplast _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . in col the marker reached its destination as expected . however analyses of cotyledon epidermal cells of _PROTEIN_ seedlings _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ showed partial retention of the marker in the _LOCATION_ network in clear contrast with the control . interestingly we also found that in _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was retained within the large globular structure and showed evident signal within the smaller circular structures at the cell s periphery . combined with the evidence of a redistribution of _LOCATION_ markers in the _LOCATION_ partial retention of _METHOD_ in the _LOCATION_ supports our hypothesis that the _PROTEIN_ mutant has defects in _LOCATION_ protein export . we next analyzed _PROTEIN_ at an ultrastructural level . transmission electron microscopy revealed that the large structures observed in the cotyledon epidermal cells of _PROTEIN_ seedlings were in _PROTEIN_ parallel aggregations of large inclusions inside the lumen of the _LOCATION_ . interestingly these structures appeared to be semi crystalline in nature with longitudinal striations and were considerably thinner than the typical _LOCATION_ located fusiform bodies reported previously in arabidopsis and on occasion they showed a branching pattern . the typical fusiform bodies with less discernable internal structure were also found in the _LOCATION_ outside the aberrant globular structures . there were no obvious differences in the organization of other organelles in these cells . we believe that _PROTEIN_ represents a mutant with clear _LOCATION_ morphological and functional defects . therefore we next sought to identify the mutation responsible for the _PROTEIN_ phenotype . to generate a mapping population we crossed the _PROTEIN_ mutant with ler . the genomic dna of plants exhibiting the recessive phenotype was analyzed and a candidate region with the mutation was rough mapped between and bac clones on chromosome at a mbp intervals . to identify the point mutation we sequenced the genomic dna of the _PROTEIN_ mutant by illumina genome analyzer ii . within the candidate region homozygous single nucleotide _METHOD_ were identified of which were found within transcription units . seven of these snps were found within coding regions but only four were predicted to be non silent mutations . among these only one snp resulted in a typical g/c to a/t _METHOD_ transition which caused a _PROTEIN_ codon change in the _GENE_ locus _PROTEIN_ and resulted in the missense mutation of a proline residue in position into a leucine residue at transcriptional level . to test whether such mutation was indeed responsible for the observed phenotype we analyzed _PROTEIN_ seedlings stably _PROTEIN_ the cdna of either _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ under the control of a camv promoter using a confocal microscope . we found that the _PROTEIN_ phenotype was complemented by the wild type cdna but not by the cdna bearing the mutation indicating that the missense mutation was indeed responsible for the phenotype . because we were working with a missense mutant we aimed to compare the phenotype with that of a knock down/out mutant . this experiment was important to distinguish whether the _LOCATION_ integrity defects of the _PROTEIN_ mutant were linked to the presence of the _PROTEIN_ mutant protein or to _PROTEIN_ reduced/absent transcript levels . to do so we isolated a t dna col insertion line in the first exon from the _PROTEIN_ stock center _PROTEIN_ . rt pcr of homozygous lines for the t dna insertion did not show presence of transcript compared to controls _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ indicating that _PROTEIN_ is most likely a knock out . to test whether the _PROTEIN_ phenotype was linked to an aberrant protein product _PROTEIN_ or abnormal _PROTEIN_ transcript levels we aimed to compare the _PROTEIN_ subcellular phenotype with that of _PROTEIN_ . to this end we transformed _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . we found that the distribution of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in transformed _PROTEIN_ cotyledons clearly phenocopied that of _PROTEIN_ in that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was partially redistributed to the _LOCATION_ as well as to globular and circular structures . in addition complemented lines _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ did not have such structures . together these data confirm our forward genetics analyses showing that the _PROTEIN_ phenotype was linked to the _PROTEIN_ locus . importantly also the evidence that a knock out mutant phenocopied _PROTEIN_ suggested not only that _PROTEIN_ is a non functional protein but also indicated that the _LOCATION_ integrity defects of the _PROTEIN_ mutant are not linked to the presence of the aberrant protein _PROTEIN_ product in the _LOCATION_ but rather to the absence of intact _PROTEIN_ transcript . analyses of the primary sequence of _PROTEIN_ indicate that the protein contains amino acid residues with a predicted molecular _METHOD_ of approximately kd . _PROTEIN_ is annotated as _PROTEIN_ and as a member of the superfamily of plant gdsl like lipases however unlike all the other members it does not contain the flexible active site serine in the canonical gdsl motif located near the n terminus that is essential for lipase activity in this family . in accordance with this finding absence of lipase activity of _PROTEIN_ has been confirmed recently . signalp prediction server indicates the presence of an n terminal signal sequence for insertion in the _LOCATION_ . the protein sequence does not have obvious retention signals suggesting that it may be exported from the _LOCATION_ to distal compartments such as the _LOCATION_ and the apoplast . to investigate this possibility we aimed to examine _PROTEIN_ localization using a stable transformation system . we first transformed _PROTEIN_ plants with a _PROTEIN_ fusion to a monomeric red _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . _METHOD_ is more resistant to low ph than _METHOD_ therefore it is better suited as a marker for acidic compartments such as the apoplast or the _LOCATION_ than _METHOD_ . confocal analyses showed that the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was clearly localized in the _LOCATION_ . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ complemented the _PROTEIN_ phenotype indicating that the protein is a functional fusion therefore its distribution must at least partially overlap with that of the endogenous _PROTEIN_ . because the _METHOD_ signal was confined to the cell body rather than in the apoplastic space in plasmolyzed _PROTEIN_ cotyledonal epidermal cells _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ we concluded that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ is not secreted to the apoplast . further evidence that _PROTEIN_ is directed to the _LOCATION_ is provided in figure . we have also gathered evidence that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ may be localized in the _LOCATION_ in transient _PROTEIN_ assays . finally we aimed to compare the _METHOD_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ with that of the _PROTEIN_ mutant . analyses of _PROTEIN_ transformants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ showed that in clear contrast to the wild type protein the mutant protein fusion was retained in the _LOCATION_ network where it accumulated in bright large structures . as expected from experiments using the untagged _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ did not complement the _PROTEIN_ phenotype .
