the proper organization of cortical microtubule arrays is essential for anisotropic growth in plants but how distinct array patterns are formed is not understood . here we report a relationship between microtubule dynamics and array organization using transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ modified tubulins . when green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ or a hemaglutinin epitope tag was fused to the n terminus of tubulins and _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis plants these tubulins were incorporated into microtubules along with endogenous tubulins . plants _PROTEIN_ the modified tubulins were phenotypically normal and possessed transversely oriented cortical arrays in the epidermal cells of the root elongation zone however the _PROTEIN_ of modified tubulins caused right handed helical growth increased trichome branching and a shallow left handed helical array organization . in cells _PROTEIN_ the modified tubulins microtubule dynamicity was suppressed and polymerization was promoted and _METHOD_ labeled larger regions of the microtubule end more frequently when compared with control cells . we propose that the n terminal appendage introduced into tubulin inhibits _PROTEIN_ hydrolysis thus producing polymerization prone microtubules with an extended _PROTEIN_ cap . consistent with this interpretation plants _PROTEIN_ an tubulin mutated in the _PROTEIN_ activating domain exhibited similar microtubule properties with _PROTEIN_ to dynamics and the localization of _METHOD_ and showed right handed helical growth .
we have previously reported that when _METHOD_ was fused to the n terminus of the arabidopsis tubulin isoform _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ constitutively under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus promoter in transgenic arabidopsis plants the fusion protein was incorporated into and _METHOD_ labeled microtubules in aerial tissues . the transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ however showed helical growth phenotypes the elongating epidermal cells of _PROTEIN_ and petioles were slightly skewed in a steep right handed helix thus resulting in a fan like arrangement of these tissues in the counter clockwise orientation when viewed from above whereas the root epidermal cells grew straight as in wild type root cells . to test whether these moderate twisting phenotypes are unique to the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ construct we generated transgenic arabidopsis lines in which _METHOD_ was fused to the c terminus of _PROTEIN_ or to either the n or c terminus of the arabidopsis tubulin isoform _PROTEIN_ . several kanamycin resistant lines were obtained for each construct and were analyzed for the transgene _PROTEIN_ . northern blot analysis with a _METHOD_ hybridization probe detected full length transcripts in _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ lines whereas only partially degraded transcripts were present in _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ lines and no transgene transcripts were detectable in _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ lines . consistent with the negligible steady state rna levels no _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ proteins accumulated and no _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was detected in these transgenic lines . in contrast _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ proteins were present in transgenic plants at of the endogenous tubulin levels and labeled microtubules _METHOD_ in aerial tissues . microtubules in the root epidermal cells however were not well labeled with these _METHOD_ tubulin proteins . when arabidopsis seedlings were divided into aerial parts and roots and examined separately by western blotting levels of both _METHOD_ fusion proteins in the root tissue were approximately of those in aerial tissues indicating that low protein accumulation is at least partially responsible for inefficient microtubule labeling in the root cells . the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ plants did not show helical growth or other abnormal phenotypes and were indistinguishable from wild type plants in development and morphology . because the significant size of the barrel shaped kda _METHOD_ protein may interfere with tubulin polymerization we next tested whether a short peptide tag affects tubulin functions when fused to the n or c terminus of tubulins . when a peptide sequence encoding the hemaglutinin epitope was attached to the n terminus of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ constitutively transgenic arabidopsis plants exhibited a semi dwarf phenotype and low fertility . not only _PROTEIN_ and petiole epidermal cells but also root showed right handed helical growth and often became radially swollen . as the constitutive _PROTEIN_ of ha tagged _PROTEIN_ resulted in a low seed set we also generated transgenic arabidopsis lines _PROTEIN_ in which ha _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ can be induced by treatment with estradiol in the xve gene induction system . the ha _PROTEIN_ plants showed severe right handed helical growth and anisotropic growth phenotypes in _PROTEIN_ petioles and roots upon treatment with the inducer . in contrast when the myc tag and the ha tag were respectively attached to the c terminus of _PROTEIN_ and to the n terminus of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ under the control of the promoter these transgenic lines did not differ from wild type plants in development and morphology . two dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the tubulin _METHOD_ and subsequent immunoblotting with an tubulin antibody revealed that the tagged _PROTEIN_ proteins were present in of the endogenous tubulins . immunohistochemical analysis of the transgenic roots further showed that the epitope tagged _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ proteins were incorporated into the cortical microtubule arrays in the root epidermal cells . microtubules have an important role in the three dimensional branching of trichomes . we found that plants _PROTEIN_ ha _PROTEIN_ protein showed additional phenotypes in leaf trichomes besides right handed helical growth in elongating epidermal cells . in the wild type columbia ecotype more than of leaf trichomes had three branches and approximately had four branches . transgenic lines _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ myc or ha _PROTEIN_ and the ha _PROTEIN_ line in the absence of the inducer had trichome branch numbers statistically indistinguishable from the wild type plants . in the plants constitutively or inducibly _PROTEIN_ ha _PROTEIN_ trichomes with three branches _PROTEIN_ to whereas that with more than four branches increased to of the total trichome population . data represent percentages of trichomes having the indicated number of branches . nd not determined . / absence/presence of estradiol in the culture medium . atotal number of trichomes counted on rosette leaves of day old seedlings . in the zwi mutant with a defect in a unique calmodulin binding kinesin trichomes have either one or two branches trichomes with more than three branches are not observed . however brief treatment of the mutant 's leaves with taxol a microtubule stabilizer partially rescues the branching defect . a _PROTEIN_ homolog in cotton decorates cortical microtubules in cotton fibers suggesting _PROTEIN_ may stabilize microtubules by directly binding to them . when ha _PROTEIN_ was constitutively _PROTEIN_ in the zwi background it occasionally induced an additional branch initiation thus producing trichomes with three branches . thus ha _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ phenotypically mimicked the presumably stabilizing effect of taxol on branch initiation in zwi trichomes . to address whether the organization of microtubule arrays underlies the right handed helical growth in ha _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ cells we examined the cortical array arrangement in epidermal cells of the root elongation zone by immunohistochemistry with an tubulin antibody . wild type cells transgenic cells constitutively _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ myc or ha _PROTEIN_ and transgenic cells of the ha _PROTEIN_ line in the absence of the inducer all had cortical arrays aligned predominantly transverse to the cell 's longitudinal axis whereas the transgenic cells either constitutively or inducibly _PROTEIN_ ha _PROTEIN_ showed oblique arrays that were arranged in shallow left handed helices . it should be noted that the epitope tagged tubulins were incorporated into microtubules apparently uniformly and did not show any preference to label particular microtubules with distinct angles or particular microtubules that were formed in distinct cortical regions of a cell . figure shows a quantitative analysis of the microtubule angle relative to the cell 's longitudinal axis demonstrating that the overall organization of arrays shifted from a transverse to left handed orientation in ha _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ cells . it is possible that the left handed organization of arrays in ha _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ cells was caused by altered microtubule dynamics . to analyze microtubule dynamics we crossed a transgenic line constitutively _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ with the ha _PROTEIN_ line . the dynamics of the plus end of individual microtubules was then monitored in epidermal cells in an upper hypocotyl region . growth rates of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ labeled microtubules in control cells and non induced ha _PROTEIN_ cells were and mm respectively whereas shrinkage rates were and mm . after the induced _PROTEIN_ of ha _PROTEIN_ growth and shrinkage rates of microtubules were respectively reduced to and mm . the frequency of catastrophe did not differ significantly between these three samples . the frequency of rescue in ha _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ cells however was greater than that in control cells or non induced ha _PROTEIN_ cells . the observed differences in growth rate shrinkage rate and rescue frequency were significant . as a result microtubule dynamicity a composite measurement of all the tubulin dimers gained or lost per unit time was reduced to mm and microtubules spent more time in the paused state in ha _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ cells when compared with microtubule dynamicity of and mm and the percentages of paused microtubules were and respectively . remarkably microtubules in ha _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ cells spent much less time in shrinkage than microtubules in control and non induced cells . therefore _PROTEIN_ of ha _PROTEIN_ made the microtubule plus end less dynamic and more prone to polymerization . the frequency of catastrophe was calculated from the inverse of the mean time spent in growth and the frequency of rescue was obtained from the inverse of the mean time spent in shrinkage as described previously . dynamicity was calculated by dividing the sum of the length grown and shortened by the total time a particular mt was observed . values for growth and shrinkage rates and dynamicity are _PROTEIN_ as mean sd . statistically significant difference from control . the observed changes in microtubule dynamics suggest that in ha _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ cells more microtubule plus ends should be in the polymerization or paused phase at a given time point when compared with control cells . to test this prediction directly we analyzed the microtubule plus ends labeled by a _METHOD_ fused to arabidopsis end binding _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . is concentrated at the growing end and from where it abruptly disappears when the microtubule begins to shorten . although several _METHOD_ can contribute to localization at the tip may have an increased affinity for a specific structure of the polymerizing microtubule end such as the tubulin sheet or _PROTEIN_ cap . pauses in polymerization lasting for several seconds without a transition to depolymerization have been generally observed in vivo and in vitro and also binds to the paused microtubule ends . it has been proposed that a small group of protofilaments occasionally stabilized at the microtubule tip is unable to undergo tubule closure leading to microtubule pauses . in control and non induced cells of the ha _PROTEIN_ line _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ localized to microtubule plus ends in comet like trailing tails at densities of and comets per respectively . taxol treatment of the control cells resulted in more or less uniform labeling along the lengths of microtubules and their occasional bundling . in a large proportion of the taxol treated microtubules one polymerizing end was labeled with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ as comets much more strongly than the microtubule wall . these _METHOD_ labeled microtubule ends were present at a density of comets per . when ha _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was induced by estradiol _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ labeled microtubule plus ends exhibited comets per . this moderate increase was statistically significant at p < . / absence/presence of estradiol in the culture medium . statistically significant difference from control . we found that _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ labeled an extended region of the plus end in ha _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ cells although the effect was not as strong as observed in taxol treated control cells . in of the ha _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ cells entire microtubules were labeled as typically seen in taxol treated control cells . these cells were excluded in the comet size analysis . such an extended labeling pattern was not observed in control cells . when the mean intensity of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was plotted along the end of the labeled microtubule _METHOD_ intensity with its peak at the end diminished exponentially to both directions . the mean half length at which _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ intensity diminished to half of its peak intensity was calculated independently in the leading tail to the direction of the microtubule plus end and in the lagging tail to the direction of the minus end . the sum of the half length of both directions was used to evaluate the length of _PROTEIN_ comets . the half comet length was in control cells and in uninduced ha _PROTEIN_ cells whereas it increased to in ha _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ cells . alagging and leading tails exponentially _PROTEIN_ in _METHOD_ intensity toward the minus and plus ends of the microtubule respectively . bconstants in the exponential regression formula y a ln b. cthe sum of and defines the half length of the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ comets . we speculated that an epitope tag at the n terminus of tubulin may sterically interfere with its ability to stimulate the hydrolysis of _PROTEIN_ upon joining to a microtubule polymer at the plus end . we reasoned that mutations in the tubulin residues involved in the activation of _PROTEIN_ may produce cellular and morphological phenotypes similar to those observed in ha _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plants . to test this prediction we introduced two simultaneous ala substitution mutations in _PROTEIN_ in place of the residues _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ which are predicted to function in the activation of _PROTEIN_ based on microtubule structure . constitutive _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ mutant tubulin under the control of the promoter in transgenic arabidopsis plants caused right handed helical growth in _PROTEIN_ and petiole and increased branching in leaf trichomes . part of the _PROTEIN_ was incorporated into the cortical arrays in the root epidermal cells although considerable mutant tubulin protein was observed as discrete dots . the distribution of cortical microtubule arrays in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ root cells was shifted slightly toward the direction of left handed helices but this mild defect in root microtubule organization was apparently not sufficient to cause the helical growth phenotype in roots . plus end dynamics of individual microtubules in hypocotyl epidermal cells revealed slower shrinkage rate and more frequent rescue in the _PROTEIN_ cells than in the controls . plus end labeling patterns of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ further showed that the growing plus ends were moderately more frequent and the labeled plus end region was longer in the _PROTEIN_ cells compared with control cells . therefore mutations in the presumed _PROTEIN_ activation residues resulted in longer and more frequent _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ comets at microtubule polymerizing plus ends . the observed shift of the overall microtubule dynamics toward polymerization is likely a consequence of the structural change at the plus ends which may reflect the size of the _PROTEIN_ cap . the terminal effect of these changes in microtubule dynamics on cell elongation was a prominent skewing of the cell elongation axis in the direction of right handed growth .
seedlings were grown aseptically on a nutrient medium solidified with agar at with a h h dark cycle . taxol was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide and diluted with the culture medium before use so that the final concentration of dimethyl sulfoxide was < . to induce _PROTEIN_ of ha _PROTEIN_ in the ha _PROTEIN_ plants seedlings were grown on a nutrient agar medium containing estradiol . ha _PROTEIN_ ha _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ myc transgenes were introduced into the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ line the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ line and by genetic crosses . double homozygous lines for each transgene or mutation were used for experiments . tubulin constructs were first made in the cloning vectors as follows these tubulin constructs were then inserted between the smai and saci sites of pbi so that fusion proteins are _PROTEIN_ under the control of the promoter . the ha _PROTEIN_ construct was also transferred as the xhoi spei fragment to of an estrogen receptor based chemical inducible system . these tubulin constructs in binary vectors were introduced into the agrobacterium tumefaciens strain _PROTEIN_ by electroporation . arabidopsis plants were transformed by the floral dip method . leaf trichomes on day old seedlings were observed with an olympus microscope . for protein extraction arabidopsis seedlings were ground in liquid nitrogen and then in ice cold extraction buffer . after filtration through two layers of miracloth insoluble debris was removed by centrifugation at g for min at . soluble protein fractions were obtained after centrifuging the total protein extracts twice at g for min at . soluble protein samples were separated on a _PROTEIN_ polyacrylamide gel . for two dimensional gel electrophoresis soluble proteins were loaded onto immobiline drystrip by passive rehydration overnight at room temperature . the proteins in the strips were resolved in the first dimension by isoelectric focusing for v at using the multiphor ii apparatus . after the strips were equilibrated for min in _PROTEIN_ buffer _PROTEIN_ they were placed on top of a _PROTEIN_ polyacrylamide gel and run in the second dimension at ma per gel . for immunoblot analyses proteins were transferred to a hybond p _LOCATION_ and detected using the ecl plus kit according to the manufacturer 's instructions . anti tubulin antibody and anti tubulin antibody were used as primary antibodies . whole seedlings with primary roots of approximately cm long were used for immunostaining . anti tubulin antibody anti ha antibody and anti c myc antibody were used as primary antibodies . the secondary antibody used was the fluorescein isothiocyanate conjugated anti mouse antibody . quantitative analyses of cortical microtubule orientation were performed essentially as described by citation and citation . root epidermal cells in the elongation zone were observed with an eclipse confocal microscope with excitation at nm . epidermal cells of the upper hypocotyls of day old light grown seedlings _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ were analyzed . confocal imaging of individual microtubules was performed essentially as described by citation and citation using a dmre microscope equipped with a scanning head . images were taken every sec during the course of min and were analyzed using scion image . parameters of microtubule dynamics were calculated from three independent measurements per construct or treatment . epidermal cells of the upper hypocotyls of day old seedlings _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ were observed with the eclipse with excitation at nm . the _METHOD_ intensity of the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ comet was analyzed using metamorph _PROTEIN_ according to the procedure described by citation . the number of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ comets in a square of the image was measured in squares of at least cells . for treatment with taxol seedlings were directly germinated and further grown in nutrient agar medium containing taxol .
