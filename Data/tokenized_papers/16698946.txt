to identify molecular _METHOD_ controlling vein patterns we analyzed scarface mutants . sfc cotyledon and leaf veins are largely fragmented unlike the interconnected networks in wild type plants . _PROTEIN_ encodes an adp ribosylation _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ activating protein a class with well established roles in vesicle trafficking regulation . quadruple mutants of scf and three homologs showed a modestly enhanced vascular phenotype . genetic interactions between sfc and pinoid and between sfc and gnom suggest a possible function for _PROTEIN_ in trafficking of auxin efflux regulators . genetic analyses also revealed interaction with cotyledon vascular suggesting that lipid based signals may underlie some _PROTEIN_ arf gap functions . to assess possible roles for _PROTEIN_ in auxin transport we analyzed sfc roots which showed exaggerated responses to exogenous auxin and higher auxin transport capacity . to determine whether _PROTEIN_ intracellular trafficking was affected we analyzed _PROTEIN_ green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ dynamics using confocal microscopy in sfc roots . we found normal _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ localization at the apical _LOCATION_ of root cells but treatment with brefeldin a resulted in _PROTEIN_ accumulating in smaller and more numerous compartments than in the wild type . these data suggest that _PROTEIN_ is required for normal intracellular transport of _PROTEIN_ from the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ to the endosome .
we previously described five phenotypically identical sfc alleles . sfc mutants are small with epinastic cotyledons and leaves that also show distinct vein pattern defects . in contrast with the wild type which produces organs with continuous veins sfc mutant leaves and cotyledons contain vascular islands which are isolated fragments of vascular tissue . we found two new sfc alleles in our mutant collection . complementation tests indicated that these mutants were allelic to sfc but they showed weaker vein pattern phenotypes . we compared cotyledon vein pattern and root development in sfc sfc and sfc mutants . root length _PROTEIN_ root numbers and cotyledon vein pattern features showed a clear trend with sfc having the most severe defects sfc intermediate defects and sfc the weakest defects . these data indicate that sfc sfc and sfc represent weak intermediate and strong alleles respectively . furthermore the correspondence between root phenotype severity and vein pattern severity suggests that _PROTEIN_ either directly or indirectly controls root development . cotyledon and root defects in sfc alleles to identify the _PROTEIN_ gene we mapped _PROTEIN_ to the upper arm of chromosome and sequenced the genes within the mapping interval from our sfc mutants . only gene _GENE_ contained mutations and we identified a different lesion for each of our seven sfc alleles . we also obtained a line containing a t dna insertion within this gene this insertion resulted in a strong sfc phenotype and the mutant failed to complement sfc confirming that we identified the correct gene . strong alleles included two with splice site defects one nonsense allele and a deletion leading to a frame shift . two alleles had missense mutations one missense mutation led to a strong phenotype and the other missense mutation led to an intermediate phenotype . finally the weak sfc allele had a lesion within intron . _GENE_ was recently identified in the cloning of _PROTEIN_ which was also identified as an arabidopsis mutant with vein pattern defects . this correspondence indicates that sfc is allelic to _PROTEIN_ and corroborates that we have identified the correct gene . lesions in sfc alleles the _PROTEIN_ gene encompasses exons and it encodes a predicted amino acid protein . the protein contains four domains a bar domain a ph domain an arf gap domain and two anykrin repeats . this is the same domain organization as centaurin an acap type arf gap . _PROTEIN_ and the human centaurin share amino acid identity and similarity and are aligned over of their length . bar domains especially in conjunction with an adjacent ph domain have been implicated as _LOCATION_ curvature sensors . ph domains bind to inositol phosphates and can confer binding to specific _LOCATION_ . the arf gap domain activates _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ activity of arfs which then leads to vesicle uncoating . ankyrin domains confer binding to other proteins and as components of arf gap proteins have been shown to bind actin . a previous analysis of arabidopsis small _PROTEIN_ genes identified arf gap domain _PROTEIN_ proteins _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ that fell into four classes . _PROTEIN_ corresponds to _PROTEIN_ and is one of four proteins belonging to class . we aligned the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ with those of the three other arabidopsis class _PROTEIN_ proteins and two animal _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ are characterized by four invariant cys residues all four of which are present in _PROTEIN_ . our two missense alleles have lesions within the _PROTEIN_ . in sfc a tyr is substituted for the second conserved cys . this residue is essential for function thus the strong sfc phenotype is consistent with _PROTEIN_ functioning as an arf gap . in sfc an asn is substituted for an asp . this position shows less conservation than the cys thus this lesion is also consistent with the sfc allele 's intermediate phenotype . the arabidopsis genome contains three additional genes encoding _PROTEIN_ proteins highly related to _PROTEIN_ . amino acid alignments showed amino acid identity between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and identity between both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . the similarity of these four genes raised the possibility that they could carry out partially redundant functions . to determine whether _PROTEIN_ patterns of these genes overlapped we compared _PROTEIN_ using real time rt pcr and rna isolated from a variety of tissues . we detected _PROTEIN_ of each of these four genes . in roots rna corresponding to all four genes was present however _PROTEIN_ transcript levels were much higher than _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ . by contrast in hypocotyl tissue only low transcript levels for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were detected and no _PROTEIN_ rna was detected . _PROTEIN_ rna was also not detected in cotyledons however for this tissue _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ rna levels were intermediate and _PROTEIN_ rna levels were low . we also detected rna from all four genes in the leaf shoot apical meristem samples here _PROTEIN_ rna predominated _PROTEIN_ was low and _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were intermediate . rna extracted from mixed age siliques also showed _PROTEIN_ of all four _PROTEIN_ genes but in this tissue all four rnas were present at low levels . the d old seedlings reflected the combined rna levels detected in each d old tissue . the relatively high level of _PROTEIN_ probably reflects the abundant roots on these seedlings and the absence of _PROTEIN_ is likely to reflect this gene 's _PROTEIN_ in only a few tissues or cell types . to assess functions of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ we characterized t dna insertion alleles _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . the t dna insertions for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants fall in exon and intron respectively while the t dna insertion for _PROTEIN_ is nucleotides upstream of the translational start site but within the nucleotide untranslated region . to determine whether the t dna insertions into the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ genes affected rna abundance we isolated rna from _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants and performed real time rt pcr analysis . for analysis of _PROTEIN_ we used rna prepared from roots where _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is high . primers used for this analysis were located of the t dna insertion and we found reduced transcript levels . for analysis of _PROTEIN_ we used rna prepared from cotyledons where _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is high . in this case primers were located of the insertion . the _PROTEIN_ mutant had strongly reduced rna levels . these analyses indicated that the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ insertion alleles were at least hypomorphic so we proceeded with our phenotypic analyses . we used pcr to identify heterozygous and homozygous mutants and followed these plants through two generations . we identified no defects in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ single mutants and no enhancement of sfc in each of the three sfc agd double mutant combinations . additional crosses were performed to make multiple mutant plants and enhancement of the sfc phenotype was not observed until we had constructed the quadruple mutant . the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ sfc quadruple mutant seedlings appeared similar to sfc single mutants . however quadruple mutant seedlings were slightly smaller and had shorter roots than sfc single mutants and cotyledon and leaf vein pattern defects were modestly enhanced . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ sfc mutant cotyledons contained many small vis and fewer of the elongated vis that are typical of sfc mutants although elongated vis were not completely eliminated . the most notable feature of the quadruple mutant however was the discontinuous cotyledon primary vein . we quantified the cotyledon primary vein defect and considered the vein to be intact if it extended through the proximal of the organ . we observed discontinuous primary veins in of quadruple mutant cotyledons and many quadruple mutants showed a discontinuous primary vein in one cotyledon while the other cotyledon 's primary vein was intact . among the quadruple mutants with intact primary veins showed regions where the primary vein was very thin sometimes narrowed to a single file of tracheary elements . in addition showed a zigzag like pattern . although included with the intact primary veins close examination of these zigzag primary veins showed that the nonlinear portions were often not continuous . in addition to the quadruple mutant phenotype the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ triple mutants also showed a low penetrance cotyledon vein pattern phenotype . to determine whether the discontinuous primary veins resulted from defects in vascular differentiation or patterning we used differential interference contrast to examine areas of primary vein discontinuity for the presence of procambial cells . among cotyledons contained only one or two procambial cells extending beyond the differentiated tracheary element cells . six cotyledons contained longer procambial strands but only one had procambium that was continuous with other vascular tissue . these results strongly suggest that these four _PROTEIN_ genes are required to pattern the cotyledon primary vein . a defect in patterning rather than differentiation is also consistent with the _PROTEIN_ of all four class _PROTEIN_ genes in mixed age siliques which would include developing embryos but not in mature cotyledons . leaves of the quadruple mutant also showed slightly less vein connectivity than sfc single mutants which was especially noticeable at the leaf margin . in addition the quadruple mutant 's leaf primary vein failed to connect with the vascular tissue of the stem . this lack of connectivity was only observed in quadruple mutants and was never observed in sfc single mutants nor in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ triple mutants . this phenotype has previously only been observed in plants grown in media containing _PROTEIN_ auxin transport inhibitors . the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ triple mutant leaf vein pattern appeared mostly normal although the leaf shape was occasionally asymmetric . the similarity between the quadruple mutant 's leaf vein pattern phenotype and leaves from _PROTEIN_ auxin transport inhibitor grown plants suggests that these four genes may perform partially redundant functions in _PROTEIN_ auxin transport during leaf development . to determine the relationship between _PROTEIN_ and other genes implicated as playing a role in vein patterning we characterized sfc _PROTEIN_ double mutants . _PROTEIN_ mutants have misshapen leaves with greatly reduced vein patterns and a twisted root phenotype but a normal cotyledon vein pattern . sfc _PROTEIN_ double mutants produced cotyledons that resembled sfc and leaves that showed a _PROTEIN_ shape with the epinasty of sfc . the cotyledon vein pattern also resembled the sfc single mutant . the leaf showed the reduced and disorganized vein pattern of _PROTEIN_ with the fragmentation into the vi of sfc . this additive phenotype suggests that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ function in independent pathways . we also analyzed double mutants with cotyledon vein _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ encodes an inositol polyphosphate phosphatase and _PROTEIN_ mutants produce cotyledons and leaves lacking vascular connections at organ margins and between higher order veins . an line homozygous for _PROTEIN_ and segregating sfc produced double mutants that were slightly smaller than sfc single mutants alone and produced a vein pattern that was essentially the same as sfc . to further explore possible sfc _PROTEIN_ interactions we also characterized double mutants using the intermediate sfc allele . the sfc _PROTEIN_ double mutants were smaller than sfc single mutants and they showed a more severe vein pattern phenotype . the sfc single mutant leaves contain intact primary and secondary veins and higher order veins are fragmented whereas the sfc _PROTEIN_ double mutant had fragmented secondary veins and many vis . this enhancement of sfc by the loss of _PROTEIN_ suggests that the products of these two genes might function in the same pathway . the major hypothesis to explain vein patterning canalization of auxin flow proposes that vein position is specified by paths of high auxin flux . _PROTEIN_ of this hypothesis we considered that sfc 's vis could arise due to defects in auxin transport or defects in response to transported auxin . to sort out these possibilities we characterized _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ patterns in sfc mutants . gus contains a synthetic auxin inducible promoter and _PROTEIN_ is most commonly interpreted as indicating patterns of auxin accumulation in auxin responsive cells although induction by brassinolide has also been observed . patterns of gus staining conferred by in wild type leaves and cotyledons have been well characterized confers gus staining in leaf provascular and procambial cells consistent with a positive role for auxin flux as an inductive signal for vascular identity . in sfc leaves conferred gus staining at the same developmental stage as the wild type however the sfc gus staining was largely confined to isolated spots that corresponded to developing vis . even in older organs when no longer conferred gus staining to veins of wild type leaves but instead only to hydathodes most sfc vis continued to show strong gus staining . in these older sfc organs cotyledon gus staining was consistently at proximal positions of vis while leaf vi gus staining was typically at one end of the vi but with no consistent proximal/distal or medial/lateral _PROTEIN_ . the prolonged _PROTEIN_ associated with sfc vis suggested that auxin responses were intact . to test this we examined auxin inducibility of in sfc and the wild type . for both the wild type and sfc mutants exogenous auxin treatment induced strong _PROTEIN_ in roots and leaves . these data combined with previous results indicating exaggerated auxin induced inhibition of root elongation in sfc mutants indicated that auxin responses are intact in sfc mutants . to examine possible roles for _PROTEIN_ in auxin transport we analyzed double mutants using pid . _PROTEIN_ is a ser thr protein kinase that affects _PROTEIN_ positioning of the _PROTEIN_ auxin efflux regulator . pid mutants show defects in cotyledon separation flower morphology and inflorescence structure . we found that cotyledons of pid plants showed occasional incomplete or ectopic areoles . we analyzed seedling and vein pattern phenotypes of seedlings from homozygous pid parents that segregated sfc . the double mutant seedlings and their vein patterns were variable most double mutants resembled sfc single mutants but some showed additional defects in leaf initiation or both root development and leaf initiation defects . we never observed these leaf or root phenotypes in either single mutant . double mutants with more severe morphological defects also showed greater vascular interruptions . these observations suggest that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ might function in the same pathway . we also analyzed sfc double mutants . _PROTEIN_ encodes an arf gef that is necessary for vesicle trafficking between the endosome and the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . we first analyzed crosses between sfc and the strong _PROTEIN_ allele . plants showed segregation at a ratio . this ratio is consistent with the double mutant resembling indicating epistasis of . to gain additional insight we also characterized double mutants using a weak allele identified in our mutant screen that was similar to previously described weak gn alleles . single mutants had a long unbranched root and generally a single large cotyledon with too many very _PROTEIN_ and highly interconnected veins . the sfc double mutant typically had two epinastic cotyledons and a long unbranched root similar to . the sfc cotyledon vein pattern resembled that of sfc except the sfc phenotype was modestly suppressed in that there were fewer vis . the sfc double mutant also resembled that of although the phenotype was modestly suppressed in that veins were less _PROTEIN_ and had fewer ectopic tracheary elements than in the single mutant . a similar gn _PROTEIN_ double mutant phenotype was also reported recently . this double mutant phenotype suggested mutual suppression of each single mutant phenotype and it suggested that the _PROTEIN_ arf gap might function in a pathway opposing that of the _PROTEIN_ arf gef . because methods for measuring auxin transport in arabidopsis leaves and cotyledons have not been developed we used sfc roots to analyze auxin transport and _PROTEIN_ green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ localization . the roots of sfc are shorter than the wild type and to explore whether this tissue was suitable for these analyses we characterized sfc root cellular organization . the arrangement of cells within the root meristem of sfc mutants was the same as the wild type although the zone of starch staining cells was often smaller . sfc roots also showed normal patterns of gus and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ indicating that there were no gross defects in the sfc mutants . in addition _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ within the protoxylem of the stele the same cells that show strong _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ . we also observed a modest vascular phenotype in sfc roots tracheary elements differentiated much closer to the root apex than in wild type roots and sfc pid double mutants showed occasional severe root development defects . all these observations suggested that _PROTEIN_ might be required in roots so we performed additional experiments to measure auxin transport . our strategy for measuring auxin transport is outlined in figure . indole acetic acid was applied at the root/shoot junction and after h the amount transported was measured in mm segments adjacent to the application site or further down the root . surprisingly all sfc root segments contained higher amounts of iaa than the control . these reported experiments used plants of slightly different ages to better match the root length similar trends were observed with roots that were age matched but had a greater difference in root length . we also examined the effect of napthylphthalamic acid on _PROTEIN_ iaa transport in the wild type and sfc . in the wild type iaa transport was reduced by npa to the same extent as previously reported . npa also inhibited iaa transport in sfc . these data indicate that sfc mutant roots have a higher capacity for iaa uptake and carrier mediated transport than roots of the wild type . to determine whether the reduced numbers of sfc _PROTEIN_ roots was related to shoot derived auxin we quantified _PROTEIN_ root development on intact roots roots decapitated to block auxin flow from the shoots and decapitated roots supplied with exogenous auxin . sfc mutants produced fewer _PROTEIN_ roots than control plants and removal of the shoot resulted in a _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ root production on both sfc and ler roots . however application of exogenous auxin to the decapitated root resulted in a dramatic increase in _PROTEIN_ root production in sfc more so than the wild type control . these data are consistent with the _PROTEIN_ root phenotype resulting from _PROTEIN_ auxin movement from the shoot to the root in intact sfc . moreover these data indicate that the ability to deliver auxin is not impaired in sfc roots thereby corroborating the measurements of auxin transport . taken together these data are consistent with reduced delivery of auxin to the roots of sfc mutants but greater than wild type capacity of roots to transport available auxin . the molecular identification of _PROTEIN_ as an arf gap combined with observations suggesting possible roles for _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ auxin transport and observations of sfc genetic interactions suggested that _PROTEIN_ might participate in _PROTEIN_ cycling . to test this we characterized _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein dynamics in sfc roots using _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . in the wild type _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ is abundant within the vascular stele from the root apex to the differentiation zone . by contrast in sfc mutants the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signal was restricted to a narrow zone near the root apex . we do not believe this reflects gross defects in sfc roots as dic confocal and _PROTEIN_ patterns were normal . furthermore the cell tag markers and _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ showed similar intracellular localization patterns in the wild type and sfc suggesting that organization within sfc root cells was largely normal . alternatively the small domain of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ cells in sfc mutant roots could reflect altered regulation of _PROTEIN_ gene _PROTEIN_ or premature differentiation of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ cells . consistent with previous characterizations we found _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ targeted to the apical _LOCATION_ of procambial cells in the stele of wild type roots . sfc roots showed a similar pattern of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ accumulation indicating that pathways for _PROTEIN_ synthesis and apical _LOCATION_ targeting do not require _PROTEIN_ . because _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was found in a smaller zone in sfc mutants we considered it possible that _PROTEIN_ was less stable in sfc mutants . however after incubating sfc and the wild type in the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide for h the sfc and wild type signal intensities were similar . this observation indicates that in sfc mutants _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was not overtly destabilized . these analyses also revealed occasional misoriented end walls in the protoxylem supporting a role for _PROTEIN_ in root development . to determine whether the strong influence of decapitation and auxin supplementation on _PROTEIN_ root development in sfc mutants affected _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ localization we also performed confocal analysis on decapitated plants and decapitated roots incubated in iaa for h . for both the wild type and sfc decapitation and decapitation followed by iaa incubation resulted in no strong effect on _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ localization . to explore whether _PROTEIN_ was required for subcellular movement of _PROTEIN_ we compared localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ following incubation in bfa . although bfa inhibits several different plant arf gefs it specifically inhibits movement of _PROTEIN_ from the endosome to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ without affecting movement from the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ to the endosome . consistent with previous studies the wild type incubated in bfa led to _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ accumulation in two to three large organelles that have previously been identified as endosomes . by contrast bfa treatment of sfc mutants resulted in _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ localization in to smaller organelles in each cell . this result suggests that _PROTEIN_ is required for normal cycling of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ possibly in the delivery of endocytosed vesicles to the endosome . consistent with previous studies we also found that washing out bfa in the wild type resulted in return of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ to its normal apical _LOCATION_ . in sfc bfa washout also resulted in return of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ to the apical _LOCATION_ . to further assess _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ cycling in sfc mutants we compared the wild type and sfc treated with tri iodo benzoic acid a _PROTEIN_ auxin transport inhibitor . it was shown previously that tiba treatment prevented movement of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in response to bfa or bfa washout suggesting that tiba prevents cycling . in the wild type tiba treatment did not affect _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ localization . in sfc most of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signal also remained at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ but some signal also accumulated in perinuclear regions . this result is consistent with no gross defect in _PROTEIN_ localization and together with the bfa analyses these studies strongly suggest that _PROTEIN_ cycling is altered in sfc roots . note that these experiments were all performed using the sfc allele identical bfa responses were observed in sfc mutants in independent lines and we never observed the altered bfa response in wild type plants . these observations indicate that the altered bfa response resulted from the loss of sfc rather than an unlinked mutation .
most experiments used surface sterilized seeds that were plated onto growth medium plates which were composed of murashige and skoog salts sucrose g/l mes and phytoblend agar ph . the auxin transport and root auxin response experiments used gm that was the same except murashige and skoog salts were used at and sucrose increased to . seeds were cold stratified at for d and then transferred to a tc

faststart dna master sybr green master mix . each real time rt pcr run included as an internal control a reaction for tubulin . we tested each reaction 's specificity using the machine 's standard melt curve method and products were also analyzed by gel electrophoresis . we determined the relative _PROTEIN_ of each _PROTEIN_ gene for each tissue analyzed using the standard formula ct ct . we next calculated the average value for each gene 's _PROTEIN_ in each tissue and we calculated the relative _PROTEIN_ using the equation _PROTEIN_ . oligonucleotides for _PROTEIN_ analysis were as

ctcgcctagtccttcagtgtattt . approximate positions of these oligonucleotides are also shown in supplemental figure online . we also used real time rt pcr analysis to analyze transcript levels in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants . for the _PROTEIN_ analysis we isolated rna from d old roots of wild type and _PROTEIN_ homozygous mutants and for the _PROTEIN_ analysis we isolated rna from d old cotyledons _PROTEIN_ . for these experiments we used two independent rna isolations for _PROTEIN_ analysis and three independent rna isolations for _PROTEIN_ and we used the same procedures and primers as described above . to measure acropetal auxin transport a line of iaa was applied at the root shoot junction of wild type and sfc seedlings and incubated for h. experiments presented in figure used the or d old wild type and d old sfc to facilitate size matching of the roots . another experiment using d old plants of both genotypes produced the same results . following the h incubation the mm portion of root closest to the applied iaa was discarded and the remaining roots were divided into mm upper and middle segments and a third variably sized bottom segment . for npa treatments seedlings were transferred to either control media or media containing npa and the agar line containing iaa was applied h after transfer to this media . for the npa treatment similar segments were used as described above but only the results from the upper segment are reported . the amount of iaa was determined using a scintillation counter . to test auxin induced _PROTEIN_ root formation d old seedlings were decapitated at the root shoot junction and an agar block was placed over the cut surface . _PROTEIN_ root numbers were determined d _PROTEIN_ . gus staining reactions and auxin induction of _PROTEIN_ were performed as described by citation except that auxin treatment lasted h and control incubations were performed in liquid gm . the gus staining reactions were terminated after to h and tissue was fixed and cleared as described above . the _PROTEIN_ sfc double mutant analysis used multiple independent segregating lines . in one the following phenotype ratio

mutants from all crosses single siliques were plated and segregation was analyzed using > plants . for analyses where one mutant is homozygous viable _PROTEIN_ plants that were homozygous for the
