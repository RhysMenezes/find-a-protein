multiple eukaryotic _PROTEIN_ typically localized in the cytoplasm are also distributed to the intermembrane space of chloroplasts and might thereby represent the missing link in energizing protein translocation . protein translocation into organelles is a central cellular process that is tightly regulated . it depends on signals within the preprotein and on molecular machines catalyzing the process . molecular chaperones participate in transport and translocation of preproteins into organelles to control folding and to provide energy for the individual steps . while most of the processes are explored and the components are identified the transfer of preproteins into and across the intermembrane space of chloroplasts is not yet understood . the existence of an energy source in this compartment is discussed because the required transit peptide length for successful translocation into chloroplasts is shorter than that found for mitochondria where energy is provided exclusively by _PROTEIN_ chaperones . furthermore a _LOCATION_ type _PROTEIN_ homologue was proposed as component of the chloroplast translocon in the intermembrane space energizing the initial translocation . the molecular identity of such intermembrane space localized _PROTEIN_ remained unknown which led to a controversy concerning its existence . we identified multiple _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ by _METHOD_ _METHOD_ on isolated thermolysin treated medicago sativa chloroplasts . the localization of these _PROTEIN_ of m. sativa or arabidopsis thaliana in the intermembrane space was confirmed by a self assembly _METHOD_ based in vivo system . the localization of _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ in the stroma of chloroplasts or different mitochondrial compartments could not be observed . similarly we could not identify any _LOCATION_ in the intermembrane space of chloroplast . with respect to our results we discuss the possible targeting and function of the _PROTEIN_ found in the intermembrane space .
early experiments proposed the existence of an _METHOD_ while some reports question the _METHOD_ localization of an _PROTEIN_ . therefore we inspected whether the _PROTEIN_ detected in chloroplasts is a _LOCATION_ contamination . at first we compared cell extract isolated chloroplasts and isolated outer envelopes from pea all normalized to chlorophyll content based on the previous observation that of total outer envelope protein correspond to of chlorophyll from chloroplasts . however the cell lysate was loaded according to of the chloroplast chlorophyll . as expected the majority of the _PROTEIN_ is localized in the cell lysate but a significant portion of _PROTEIN_ is localized with chloroplasts and even with isolated outer envelope . remarkably the _PROTEIN_ within the chloroplasts or the outer envelope is thermolysin resistant . the efficiency of the thermolysin treatment was confirmed by the observed protease sensitivity of the two toc components _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . in contrast to _PROTEIN_ the exclusively outer envelope localized _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and outer envelope protein of kda are enriched in chloroplasts when compared to cell lysate because cell lysate only contains of the chlorophyll content compared to the chloroplast sample . moreover the abundance of all three proteins is comparable between chloroplasts and outer envelope . this suggests that _PROTEIN_ is only associated with but not inserted into the _LOCATION_ and thus a significant portion is lost during envelope purification . similarly the abundance of the intermembrane space protein or of the stromal small subunit of rubisco _PROTEIN_ is enriched in chloroplasts . they are both protease resistant but they are not detectable in outer envelopes . to exclude that _PROTEIN_ is simply co purified because of association with chloroplast we investigated the distribution of actin . actin is known to be associated with outer envelope proteins like the chloroplast unusual positioning _PROTEIN_ and even an association with the chloroplast translocon is proposed . we detected a large amount of actin in the cell lysate . however in contrast to _PROTEIN_ we did not detect any actin in association with isolated chloroplasts or outer envelopes . this supports the specificity of the observed chloroplast localization of the _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ . the initial results suggest that a chaperone known to be localized in the _LOCATION_ exists in chloroplasts as well . in addition the observed outer envelope association suggests a localization of _PROTEIN_ in the intermembrane space . to further support the latter notion chloroplasts were isolated from pea leaves and treated with thermolysin prior to hypotonic lysis . the _LOCATION_ exposed g domain of _PROTEIN_ was protease sensitive as judged from the western blot with an antibody specific for this domain . in contrast the _PROTEIN_ detected with the antibody against _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ from tomato remained protease resistant irrespective of whether the soluble or the _LOCATION_ associated form is analyzed . to confirm that the _PROTEIN_ is not inherently thermolysin resistant chloroplasts were incubated with thermolysin in the absence or presence of triton x . after addition of thermolysin both _LOCATION_ protected proteins and _PROTEIN_ become protease accessible and are digested while _PROTEIN_ is accessible without triton treatment as judged from the occurrence of the kda fragment and fully degraded in the presence of detergent . as described before we observed a soluble and a _LOCATION_ bound _PROTEIN_ fraction . sodium _PROTEIN_ or urea treatment released all _PROTEIN_ from the _LOCATION_ while _PROTEIN_ remained _LOCATION_ bound . it is worth mentioning that salt treatment enforced an increased _LOCATION_ association of _PROTEIN_ and of the stromal prokaryotic type _PROTEIN_ which might be related to the association to partially unfolded _LOCATION_ proteins . the same result is observed for _PROTEIN_ associated with outer envelope vesicles . nevertheless we conclude that the _PROTEIN_ is partially soluble and partially _LOCATION_ attached but not _LOCATION_ embedded . the association of _METHOD_ with the _LOCATION_ is not nucleotide dependent . to evaluate the localization of the _PROTEIN_ in more detail we fractionated chloroplasts from p. sativum and m. sativa into outer and inner envelope stroma and _LOCATION_ . the fractions were highly enriched but not entirely free of cross contaminations as assayed by immunostaining of outer envelope proteins _PROTEIN_ inner envelope proteins _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ the stroma localized large subunit of rubisco _PROTEIN_ and the _LOCATION_ localized light harvesting complex protein . the _PROTEIN_ detected with the antibody was most enriched in the outer envelope fraction when compared to inner envelope or stroma of p. sativum chloroplasts . we conclude that the _LOCATION_ associated _PROTEIN_ is associated with the outer envelope and the soluble pool of _PROTEIN_ is not localized in the stroma . the eukaryotic nature of the detected _PROTEIN_ protein was supported by immunostaining of _LOCATION_ chloroplast outer envelope and stromal fractions with additional antibodies against eukaryotic _PROTEIN_ proteins namely and the commercial and which recognized _PROTEIN_ proteins in all fractions except stroma . the stromal _PROTEIN_ is detected only in chloroplast and the stromal fraction as determined by immunostaining with antibodies specific for dnak like proteins of prokaryotic origin . the protein is distinct from the mitochondrial dnak like _PROTEIN_ as judged from migration behavior . we used antibody for immunoprecipitation to further confirm the specificity . the soluble fraction after hypotonic lysis of pea chloroplasts was incubated with or followed by immunoprecipitation the results show that the eukaryotic _PROTEIN_ from lysates of pea chloroplasts was only immunoprecipitated by but not by while dnak can not be immunoprecipitated by . thus we provide evidence that the antibody used recognizes a protease resistant eukaryotic _PROTEIN_ that is not present in the stroma . to further support an _METHOD_ localization of the detected _PROTEIN_ we analyzed the protease protection of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and in outer envelope vesicles . _PROTEIN_ and are thermolysin resistant while _PROTEIN_ and are thermolysin sensitive . however after _LOCATION_ disruption by detergent treatment _PROTEIN_ and become thermolysin sensitive . this result together with the protease resistance in chloroplasts and the identified localization strongly suggests an _METHOD_ localization of the _PROTEIN_ protein . we aimed to identify _METHOD_ from medicago because the genome of m. truncatula is sequenced . we treated intact chloroplasts of medicago with thermolysin prior to hypotonic lysis . the efficiency and specificity of the protease treatment was confirmed by immunostaining of _PROTEIN_ and the large subunit of rubsco _PROTEIN_ . while the _PROTEIN_ the stromal and _PROTEIN_ remained protease resistant _PROTEIN_ was protease sensitive . the protease was inactivated by chelating of calcium ions with edta . subsequently we performed the hypotonic swelling to release the content of the stroma and the _METHOD_ . this approach was rational as a eukaryotic _PROTEIN_ is only present in the intermembrane space but not in the stroma . the soluble proteins were fractionated by anion exchange chromatography . we obtained fractions where the eukaryotic _PROTEIN_ is enriched . these fractions were pooled and proteins separated by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . the protein pattern was comparable between non treated and thermolysin treated samples and the migration of the prokaryotic and eukaryotic chaperones was confirmed by western blot . the protein bands indicated were analyzed by _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . the protein bands migrating at higher molecular weight were not analyzed as the identification of the _PROTEIN_ was in focus of our approach . as expected from the western blot the first protein band could clearly be assigned to dnak like chaperones while the third band contained eukaryotic _PROTEIN_ proteins . we noticed a contamination of band by the stromal xaa pro aminopeptidase the protein which is migrating as band . thus to further purify the _METHOD_ the soluble fraction of chloroplasts after hypotonic lysis or the _PROTEIN_ containing fractions obtained by anion exchange chromatography were incubated with _PROTEIN_ sepharose . a significant portion of the _PROTEIN_ was bound to the _PROTEIN_ column and subsequently analyzed by _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . this purification enabled the isolation of fractions exclusively containing eukaryotic _PROTEIN_ proteins . analyzing the eukaryotic _PROTEIN_ containing fractions of the three independent approaches several _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were identified . although _PROTEIN_ proteins share in general high sequence conservation the detection of the different _METHOD_ is supported by the identification of isoform specific peptides . the localization of m. truncatula _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ proteins was investigated in vivo using a transient _PROTEIN_ system in tomato protoplasts . the localization of _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ was analyzed in a. thaliana protoplasts as well to generalize the findings . to judge the different possible intracellular localizations the self assembling _METHOD_ system established for the analysis of protein localization was employed . in the _METHOD_ system the eleven stranded barrel of _METHOD_ is split into _METHOD_ comprising strands _PROTEIN_ and the very short _METHOD_ fragment containing only strand of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . _METHOD_ _METHOD_ assembles only when the two fragments are located in the same cellular sub compartment . we used different reporters to analyze the _LOCATION_ localization of _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ proteins the _LOCATION_ localized _PROTEIN_ the _METHOD_ localized monogalactosyl diacylglycerol synthase fused to _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ the _METHOD_ localized processing peptidase fused to _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and the stroma localized small subunit of rubsico fused to _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ constructs did not show _METHOD_ by _METHOD_ while fusions of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ to full length _METHOD_ yielded a _METHOD_ signature consistent with the _METHOD_ localization . the specificity of the two _METHOD_ localized _METHOD_ reporters was tested by co _PROTEIN_ with the _METHOD_ localized fused to _PROTEIN_ . the co _PROTEIN_ resulted _METHOD_ signals in certain regions in case of _PROTEIN_ as marker and in _PROTEIN_ like _METHOD_ signals in case of _PROTEIN_ both signals surrounding the auto _METHOD_ which is consistent with the _METHOD_ localization of the proteins . the difference in _METHOD_ distribution might result from different _PROTEIN_ levels . to confirm that this _METHOD_ signal does not occur by trapping a translocation intermediate _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was co _PROTEIN_ with pssu _PROTEIN_ which resulted in no _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . furthermore the functionality of pssu _PROTEIN_ was confirmed by co _PROTEIN_ with pssu _PROTEIN_ resulting in stromal _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . thus translocation intermediates are not arrested as such that _METHOD_ can assemble . next we co _PROTEIN_ the four established markers with a m. truncatula _PROTEIN_ fused to _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was observed when co _PROTEIN_ the _LOCATION_ and both _METHOD_ marker proteins but not with the stromal marker . the detailed inspection revealed that co _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ yielded a rim like structure while co _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ resulted in _METHOD_ _METHOD_ in certain areas . thus on the one hand we confirm the _LOCATION_ localization of the _PROTEIN_ and on the other hand we show the _METHOD_ assembly with the _METHOD_ marker . the differential structuring of the _METHOD_ signal with the two different _METHOD_ marker proteins might reflect that one is _LOCATION_ localized _PROTEIN_ and the other _PROTEIN_ soluble in the _METHOD_ . thus it is possible that the latter tends to aggregation leading to the punctured structure . however the occurrence of the _METHOD_ signal demonstrates the _METHOD_ localization . at the same time we could not confirm a stromal localization of a eukaryotic _PROTEIN_ . in addition the absence of _METHOD_ when co _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and pssu _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ that _METHOD_ is not assembled by formation of targeting complexes because pssu was found to be associated with _PROTEIN_ . to support the finding of multiple _PROTEIN_ proteins in the _METHOD_ the other three identified _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ of m. truncatula fused to _PROTEIN_ were co _PROTEIN_ with the _METHOD_ marker protein _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . similar to _PROTEIN_ we observed a chloroplasts surrounding _METHOD_ _METHOD_ for these proteins . in contrast co _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ fused _PROTEIN_ homologs with pssu _PROTEIN_ did not yield a _METHOD_ signal . in line with the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ findings the obtained results indicate that a portion of multiple _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ chaperones of m. truncatula is localized in the _METHOD_ of chloroplasts . the observations presented point toward a localization of _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ in the _METHOD_ . to evaluate whether this is a general concept in plants the _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and of a. thaliana fused to _PROTEIN_ were co _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . we observed a _PROTEIN_ like _METHOD_ _METHOD_ surrounding the chloroplasts for all cases and _METHOD_ was specific for chloroplasts as judged by lysis of protoplasts . as for _PROTEIN_ from m. truncatula _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was not observed when _PROTEIN_ from a. thaliana fused to _PROTEIN_ were co _PROTEIN_ with pssu _PROTEIN_ . our results so far suggest that targeting of plant _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ proteins to the _METHOD_ of chloroplasts is a general phenomenon . to confirm that the result is specific for chloroplasts we probed for localization of eukaryotic _PROTEIN_ in the _METHOD_ of mitochondria . the _PROTEIN_ was targeted to the _METHOD_ of mitochondria by a fusion to the _METHOD_ facing region of _PROTEIN_ . the specificity of this reporter was confirmed by co _PROTEIN_ with the _METHOD_ localized _PROTEIN_ fused to _PROTEIN_ which resulted in a punctuated pattern of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ indicative of mitochondria . however when _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ chaperones of a. thaliana were co _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ could not be observed . this suggests that _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ are not localized in mitochondrial _METHOD_ . thus the localization in the chloroplast _METHOD_ is specific . in addition to _PROTEIN_ also was found to be involved in _LOCATION_ preprotein targeting and in the stromal translocation process . therefore we analyzed whether eukaryotic are localized in the _METHOD_ of chloroplasts as well . co _PROTEIN_ of fused to _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ the cytoplasmic localization of the protein . in contrast co _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ did not result in _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . the absence of in the _METHOD_ of chloroplasts _METHOD_ that only the eukaryotic _PROTEIN_ is localized in the _METHOD_ .
