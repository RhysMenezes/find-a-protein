endocytosis _METHOD_ a wide range of functions in animals and plants . clathrin coated vesicle formation is an initial step of endocytosis and in animal cells is largely achieved by dynamins . however little is known of its molecular _METHOD_ in plant cells . to identify dynamin related proteins involved in endocytic ccv formation in plant cells we compared the behaviors of two structurally different arabidopsis drps _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ with those of the clathrin light chain a marker of ccvs at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ by variable incidence angle _METHOD_ microscopy . _PROTEIN_ shares domain organization with animal dynamins whereas _PROTEIN_ is plant specific . we show that green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ colocalized with clc tagged with monomeric kusabira orange in arabidopsis cultured cells . time lapse viafm observations suggested that both _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ appeared and accumulated on the existing mko clc foci and disappeared at the same time as or immediately after the disappearance of mko clc . moreover _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ colocalized and assembled/disassembled together at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ in arabidopsis cells . a yeast two hybrid assay showed that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ interacted with each other . an inhibitor of clathrin mediated endocytosis tyrphostin disturbed the localization of _PROTEIN_ but had little effect on the localization of _PROTEIN_ indicating that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ have different molecular properties . these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ participate together in endocytic ccv formation in arabidopsis cells despite the difference of their molecular properties .
to examine whether _PROTEIN_ colocalizes with clathrin at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ we compared the _METHOD_ signals of _PROTEIN_ and clc by variable incidence angle _METHOD_ microscopy . in viafm images of arabidopsis cultured cells _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and mko clc under the control of cauliflower mosaic virus promoter the _METHOD_ signals of these proteins were observed as discrete foci with diameters of nm . although foci of almost pure _METHOD_ and almost pure mko were sometimes observed most of the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ foci were colocalized with mko clc foci . in ten viafm images containing a total of _METHOD_ foci _METHOD_ _METHOD_ of the foci were _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and mko clc overlapping foci . like the _PROTEIN_ foci most of the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ foci also colocalized with mko clc foci . as for _PROTEIN_ in ten viafm images containing a total of _METHOD_ foci of the foci were _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and mko clc overlapping foci . these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ like _PROTEIN_ is almost entirely colocalized with clathrin at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . to check whether arabidopsis drps generally colocalize with clathrin at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ we compared the _METHOD_ signals of clc and _PROTEIN_ which is involved in the fission of mitochondria and _LOCATION_ and which differs from _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in its domain structure . in viafm images of arabidopsis cultured cells _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ also formed discrete foci like those of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . however _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ foci were much fewer in number than those of mko clc and were not colocalized with mko clc foci . these results strengthen the possibility that the colocalization with clathrin is not a common feature of arabidopsis drps but a specific feature of the and subfamilies . we compared the temporal behaviors of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ foci to the temporal behavior of mko clc foci . fig ref shows the viafm images of arabidopsis cultured cells _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ or _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and mko clc at the beginning of each time lapse observation covering s with s intervals respectively . additional examples of appearing and disappearing behavior are shown in movies and . fig ref respectively show time lapse images of the areas outlined by white lines in fig ref . in these images interestingly foci with only mko clc _METHOD_ appeared in the center of the areas . subsequently _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ also appeared on the mko clc foci . at t and s respectively in fig ref mko clc _METHOD_ disappeared and almost pure _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ foci remained . as time passed the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ also disappeared in these areas . fig ref show kymographs representing the time course transition of mko and _METHOD_ _METHOD_ intensities on the blue dotted line of the images at s in fig ref . in these kymographs _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ appeared and disappeared _PROTEIN_ than mko clc _METHOD_ . a comparison of the profiles of mko clc with those of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ shows that the mko clc _METHOD_ appeared and disappeared earlier than the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . these results suggest that some almost pure mko or almost pure _METHOD_ foci observed in single time point viafm images were generated during the time between the appearance and disappearance of the overlapping clc/drp foci . to determine what percentage of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ foci appear or disappear _PROTEIN_ than clc foci at the same position we analyzed the appearing and disappearing behaviors of _PROTEIN_ foci and _PROTEIN_ foci on each clc focus . in most of the appearing foci _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ appeared several frames _PROTEIN_ than mko clc _METHOD_ . on the other hand in most of the disappearing foci _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ disappeared at the same frame as or a few frames _PROTEIN_ than the mko clc _METHOD_ . these results suggest that both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ begin to accumulate at the vesicle formation sites of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ after the clathrin assembly and detach from there at the same time as or immediately after the clathrin disassembly . to investigate whether _PROTEIN_ colocalizes with _PROTEIN_ in the same foci at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ we compared the localizations of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and mko _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis cultured cells . in viafm images almost all of the _METHOD_ and mko signals also formed discrete foci and colocalized with each other . this result suggests that _PROTEIN_ colocalizes with _PROTEIN_ at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . the viafm images showed only small numbers of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ foci . to check whether _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ also colocalize with _PROTEIN_ we compared the localization of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ or _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ with that of mko _PROTEIN_ . in the viafm images the signals of _METHOD_ and mko did not overlap with each other . to confirm that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ colocalize in arabidopsis plants we compared the localizations of _METHOD_ fused to the c terminus of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and of _METHOD_ fused to the c terminus of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in arabidopsis root epidermal cells . these two _METHOD_ fusions were _PROTEIN_ under the control of kb genomic sequences immediately upstream of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ respectively . in the viafm images of arabidopsis root epidermal cells the _METHOD_ signals of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were also observed as foci and almost all of these foci overlapped with each other . in five viafm images containing a total of _METHOD_ foci _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ of the foci were _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ overlapping foci . these results indicate that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are _PROTEIN_ together and colocalize with each other at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ in the cells of arabidopsis plants . to investigate whether _PROTEIN_ assembles and disassembles together with _PROTEIN_ we compared the appearing and disappearing behaviors of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ with those of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . fig ref shows the viafm image of arabidopsis root epidermal cells _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ at the beginning of each time lapse observation covering s with _METHOD_ intervals respectively . additional examples of appearing and disappearing behavior are shown in movie . fig ref show time lapse images of the areas surrounded by the white and blue lines in fig ref . in fig ref _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ foci seemed to appear at the same time . as time passed these _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ signals increased gradually . on the other hand in fig ref _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ signals within the area surrounded by the blue lines gradually _PROTEIN_ and these _METHOD_ foci seemed to disappear at the same time . fig ref show the profiles of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ within the encircled areas in fig ref . the _METHOD_ intensities at each time point were calculated by subtracting the background _METHOD_ _METHOD_ from that within the areas surrounded by the white and blue lines in each frame of movie . in fig ref the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ profiles roughly coincided during the increasing and _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ assemble and disassemble together at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . to examine whether _PROTEIN_ interacts with _PROTEIN_ we conducted yeast two hybrid assays . in this experiment we examined the interactions among _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . our previous report using yeast two hybrid assays showed that _PROTEIN_ interacts with itself _PROTEIN_ interacts with itself and _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ do not interact . fig ref show the growth of the yeast strain on a plate with synthetic defined medium lacking leucine and tryptophan for checking the transformation of both bait and prey constructs and on a plate with synthetic defined medium lacking leucine tryptophan and histidine for analyzing the interactions between each combination of bait and prey . as shown in fig ref _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ interactions and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ interactions were detected whereas interactions between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were not detected in agreement with our previous report . interestingly _PROTEIN_ did not interact with itself but it interacted with _PROTEIN_ in both reciprocal combinations with bait and prey . these results indicate that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ interact with each other . tyrphostin an inhibitor of clathrin mediated endocytosis in plant cells was found to disturb the dynamics and to increase the size of _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ foci at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ in arabidopsis root epidermal cells . to investigate whether has similar effects on _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ we examined its effects on the localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in the same cell type . thirty minutes of exposure to caused _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ foci to increase in size and _METHOD_ intensity but _PROTEIN_ in number whereas it had no such effects on the majority of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ foci . however we observed some overlapping immobile _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ foci of about in diameter . these effects were not observed in nontreated cells _METHOD_ or in cells treated with a noneffective analog of tyrphostin . these results suggest that treatment strongly disturbs the localization of _PROTEIN_ at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ but has little effect on _PROTEIN_ which implies that the molecular properties of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are different .
