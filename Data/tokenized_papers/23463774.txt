for fertilization to occur in plants the pollen tube must be guided to enter the ovule via the micropyle . previous reports have implicated actin filaments actin binding proteins and the tip focused calcium gradient as key contributors to _PROTEIN_ growth of pollen tubes however the regulation of directional pollen tube growth is largely unknown . we reported previously that arabidopsis thaliana microtubule associated _PROTEIN_ contributes to directional cell growth and cortical microtubule organization . the preferential _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in pollen and in pollen tubes suggests that _PROTEIN_ also may function in pollen tube growth . in this study we demonstrate that _PROTEIN_ functions in pollen tubes by influencing actin organization rather than microtubule assembly . in vitro biochemical results indicate that _PROTEIN_ exhibits dependent filamentous actin severing activity . abnormal _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ ox plants was associated with disorganization of the actin _LOCATION_ in the tube apex resulting in aberrant pollen tube growth patterns and morphologies inaccurate micropyle targeting and fewer fertilization events . experiments with _PROTEIN_ mutants created by site directed mutagenesis suggest that f actin severing activity is essential to the effects of _PROTEIN_ on pollen tube growth direction . our study demonstrates that in arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ guides the direction of pollen tube growth by modulating actin filaments .
we demonstrated previously that _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ in rapidly elongating regions of root and flower tissues . data from the affymetrix _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ genechip arrays suggest that _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ primarily in male flower tissues . the arabidopsis pollen genechip indicates that _PROTEIN_ is elevated in growing pollen tubes compared with germinating or hydrated pollens . citation also reported strong _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ gene in elongating root hairs and pollen tubes . to verify these observations transgenic lines transformed with a _PROTEIN_ promoter driven gus reporter were generated . gus activity then was measured from mature pollen grains and germinated pollen tubes in vitro . to investigate the function of _PROTEIN_ in pollen tubes we obtained the t dna insertion line _PROTEIN_ from the _PROTEIN_ . quantitative rt pcr analysis indicated that _PROTEIN_ is a knockdown mutant . pollen grains from wild type and _PROTEIN_ plants were germinated in vitro on arabidopsis pollen medium and were observed h after germination . the germination rates of _PROTEIN_ pollen grains were similar to those of wild type pollen grains . moreover no obvious differences were observed in the mean length of pollen tubes between _PROTEIN_ and wild type specimens . however _PROTEIN_ pollen tubes displayed bending growth patterns with markedly swollen tip regions . the mean width of pollen tubes was significantly increased in _PROTEIN_ compared with the wild type . measurements of the net angles of pollen tube growth showed that most wild type pollen tubes grew at an average net angle of . by contrast _PROTEIN_ pollen tubes bended at a significantly larger average net angle of . the abnormal growth phenotype of _PROTEIN_ was rescued following transformation with a _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ construct . fifteen of independently transformed lines recovered the swollen tip phenotype in pollen tubes . two of these lines _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were selected for further phenotypic analysis . we concluded that the defects observed in _PROTEIN_ pollen tubes resulted from downregulation of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and that _PROTEIN_ is required for normal pollen tube growth . the complementation of the _PROTEIN_ pollen tube phenotype by _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ indicated that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ could functionally replace endogenous _PROTEIN_ . to understand the function of _PROTEIN_ in pollen tubes in vivo _PROTEIN_ overexpression lines were generated by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in the wild type background . the severity of the wavy tube phenotype correlated with the _PROTEIN_ levels of _PROTEIN_ revealed by qrt pcr analysis and with the _METHOD_ levels observed under the same microscope setting in the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ pollen tubes suggesting an association between _PROTEIN_ levels of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and the induced pollen tube phenotype . line was chosen for further analyses and named _PROTEIN_ ox . we next examined the pollen tube growth in the stigmata and styles of wild type _PROTEIN_ ox and _PROTEIN_ plants . pollen tubes were fixed and stained with aniline blue at h or h after pollination and were observed using _METHOD_ microscopy . at h after self pollination wild type _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ ox pollen had germinated and pollen tubes penetrated into stigmatic tissues to reach the top of the transmitting tracts . no significant differences were detected in the maximum lengths or overall morphologies of wild type _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ ox pollen tubes . this was consistent with the observation that knocking down _PROTEIN_ did not affect the germination or growth rates of pollen tubes in vitro . a growth defect was revealed in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ ox plants at h after self pollination when most wild type _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ ox pollen tubes had reached the bottom of the transmitting tracts and had targeted ovules . wild type pollen tubes grew along the funiculi and directly toward the ovules . by contrast _PROTEIN_ pollen tubes exhibited aberrant growth extensively elongating outward from the transmitting tract or exhibiting meandering patterns around the micropyles . these defects were absent in _PROTEIN_ pistils pollinated with wild type pollen suggesting that _PROTEIN_ did not affect the female gametophyte . the growth of _PROTEIN_ ox pollen tubes also exhibited disordered and entangled patterns in the transmitting tract . although more than half of the pollen tubes could eventually target micropyles we observed a wandering growth behavior along the pathway and some pollen tubes failed to reach ovules . these defects were not observed in _PROTEIN_ ox pistils pollinated with wild type pollen . to quantify this phenotype the relative distance ratio was calculated . the relative distance ratio was in wild type pollen tubes in _PROTEIN_ pollen tubes and in _PROTEIN_ ox pollen tubes . these quantitative results confirmed the visual observations of abnormal pollen tube growth in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ ox plants . these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ plays an important role in regulating growth direction and targeting of pollen tubes . because a change in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ level caused a male specific transmission defect we expected to observe a concomitant defect in embryonic fertilization . therefore we examined wild type and _PROTEIN_ siliques . all _PROTEIN_ siliques contained substantial seed gaps and unfertilized ovules . the proportion of overall seed setting was _PROTEIN_ . in _PROTEIN_ ox siliques seeds were reduced even more dramatically and the proportion of seed setting was . in comparison wild type siliques contained virtually no unfertilized ovules . this defect was rescued in _PROTEIN_ . however no aborted ovules were observed when wild type pollen was used to pollinate _PROTEIN_ pistils . these data indicate that _PROTEIN_ regulates pollen tube growth direction and fertilization . we previously identified _PROTEIN_ as a microtubule associated protein . however subsequent reports suggested that the microtubule _LOCATION_ was not a major contributor to pollen tube tip growth . we investigated whether the pollen tube phenotype of _PROTEIN_ mutants resulted from a change in microtubule organization by observing microtubules in pollen tubes using _METHOD_ microscopy . microtubules were organized as bundles along the elongation axis in the shank region and few microtubules were detected in the apical domain in _PROTEIN_ . these findings were identical to our observations of wild type pollen tubes . we measured the skewness of the _METHOD_ intensity distribution of microtubules to evaluate the extent of microtubule bundling in the shank region of pollen tubes . as shown in supplemental figure online microtubule bundling in _PROTEIN_ pollen tubes was similar to that in wild type tubes . we then measured the percentage of occupancy of microtubules in pollen tubes and no significant difference was detected between _PROTEIN_ pollen tubes and wild type tubes . therefore the loss of _PROTEIN_ did not significantly impact microtubule organization in pollen tubes . next we observed f actin organization in pollen tubes using lifeact _METHOD_ driven by the pollen specific promoter under a spinning disc confocal microscope . in wild type pollen tubes actin cables were aligned longitudinally in the shank and a few highly dynamic fine f actin structures were observed in the pollen tube tips . although longitudinal actin cables in the shanks appeared relatively normal across wild type _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ ox pollen tubes obvious differences were observed in the apical regions . in of _PROTEIN_ pollen tubes slightly bending longitudinal actin cables protruded into the apical regions rather than terminating at the base of the subapical regions of the pollen tubes . moreover fine f actin structures were rarely observed in the apex . similar features were identified in of wild type pollen tubes but not in any _PROTEIN_ ox pollen tubes observed . in _PROTEIN_ ox pollen tubes _PROTEIN_ longitudinal actin cables were observed in the shank regions and excessive fine f actin structures were formed and scattered in the tip . to quantify the defects of f actin organization caused by abnormal _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ we first measured the skewness in growing pollen tubes . as shown in figure more f actin bundles existed in apical and subapical regions of _PROTEIN_ pollen tubes than in wild type or _PROTEIN_ ox tubes . the mean skewness value was significantly increased in _PROTEIN_ pollen tubes compared with that of the wild type . by contrast the mean skewness value in _PROTEIN_ ox tubes was _PROTEIN_ to . next we counted the number of short filament fragments in growing pollen tube tips . more short apical f actin fragments were displayed in _PROTEIN_ ox pollen tubes than in wild type pollen tubes but they were hardly seen in _PROTEIN_ pollen tubes . all these observations suggested that the knockdown or overexpression of _PROTEIN_ can influence actin organization in the apical and subapical regions of growing pollen tubes . considering that _PROTEIN_ might function as an _PROTEIN_ rather than a microtubule associated protein in pollen tubes we conducted a biochemical analysis of _PROTEIN_ . recombinant _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ protein was prepared and purified . the ability of _PROTEIN_ to bind f actin was examined using high speed cosedimentation assays . preformed f actin was incubated with various concentrations of recombinant _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . following centrifugation supernatants and pellets were harvested and analyzed using _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ cosedimented with f actin in a dose dependent manner and reached saturation in the presence of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . the molar binding ratio of the recombinant protein to actin was estimated as at the saturation level . to determine the equilibrium dissociation constant value for this interaction _PROTEIN_ in the pellet _PROTEIN_ was plotted as a function of _PROTEIN_ in the supernatant _PROTEIN_ and the resulting data fitted with a hyperbolic function . in a representative experiment shown in figure the kd was determined to be . a mean kd value from three independent experiments was . as a control the mean kd value of _PROTEIN_ was determined to be which is consistent with a previously published value . to test whether _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ bound f actin in vitro alexa phalloidin stabilized f actin was incubated with recombinant _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and was then stained with an anti _PROTEIN_ primary antibody followed by a _METHOD_ labeled secondary antibody . samples were visualized under a microscope equipped with a charge coupled device camera . recombinant _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ localized as punctate structures along f actin . these structures were not detected when _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was first denatured by boiling or when the primary antibody was omitted . these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ binds to f actin in vitro . next we analyzed the effect of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ on actin polymerization by monitoring the polymerization of pyrene labeled actin in the presence of various concentrations of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . the polymerization rate and the quantity of f actin at equilibrium were unaffected by the presence or absence of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ indicating that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ does not regulate actin polymerization . _PROTEIN_ also been described as _PROTEIN_ owing to its capacity to bind calcium . because is markedly elevated in the apex of pollen tubes we speculated that _PROTEIN_ could exhibit its activities on f actin in a dependent manner . we observed actin filaments following incubation with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in the presence or absence of . we detected no change in actin filaments when they were incubated with nm _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or with alone . however actin filaments were fragmented if _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was present together with . these results confirmed that is required for _PROTEIN_ to sever actin filaments . time lapse total internal reflection _METHOD_ microscopy _PROTEIN_ was employed to directly observe the f actin severing activity of _PROTEIN_ . although few breaks in the alexa phalloidin stabilized actin filaments were observed in control samples incubated with either _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or alone the addition of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ induced breaks along the actin filaments in the presence of over time . the number of breaks per unit of filament length per second was defined as the severing frequency and was used to characterize the severing activity of _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ significantly raised the severing frequency to in the presence of compared with in the absence of or when f actin was incubated with in the absence of _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ severed f actin in a dose dependent manner and reached saturation when the _PROTEIN_ concentration exceeded nm . to rule out the potential negative effects of phalloidin in this assay we analyzed the severing frequencies of _PROTEIN_ under various concentrations of phalloidin and no significant difference was detected . as a control the average severing frequency of nm _PROTEIN_ was . therefore there was no negative effect on severing of _PROTEIN_ when f actin was labeled by phalloidin . to confirm that the severing activity of _PROTEIN_ was dose dependent nm _PROTEIN_ was incubated with various concentrations of . the severing frequency increased with an increase in concentration . no severing activity was detected when the concentration was below however the average severing frequency clearly increased when the concentration exceeded . these findings indicated that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ can sever actin filaments in a dose dependent manner . interestingly the f actin binding of _PROTEIN_ was not affected by the mean kd value of _PROTEIN_ was in the presence of mm which is quite similar to the mean kd value of in the absence of . using _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ we analyzed the localization patterns of _PROTEIN_ in pollen tubes during pollen tube growth . at h after germination the control green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ signal driven by the _PROTEIN_ promoter in the _PROTEIN_ background was uniformly distributed throughout the cytoplasm . in pollen tubes _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ the _METHOD_ signal was detected primarily at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ in the flanks of pollen tubes and in the inverted cones of the apical regions . plasmolysis revealed that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was associated with the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and not the cell wall . cross sectioning through the z stack projection of a pollen tube at the shank region confirmed that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was enriched at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . we quantified the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ ratio of the membranous to cytoplasmic signal in pollen tubes . a line was drawn across the pollen tube shank or across the pollen tube tip and the _METHOD_ pixel intensity was measured by imagej . the _METHOD_ signal ratio was in shanks and in the apical regions . typical pixel intensities corresponding to the lines in figure were plotted in figure . this confirmed that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was _PROTEIN_ localized to the shank _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and the inverted cone of the apex . when pollen tube growth slowed down occasionally or was arrested by freezing at for min a temporary _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signal was detected at the apical _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ that disappeared when pollen tube growth resumed . this _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ location pattern of _PROTEIN_ in pollen tubes was confirmed by _METHOD_ microscopy using a previously reported anti _PROTEIN_ polyclonal antibody . taken together our observation suggested that the association of _PROTEIN_ with the apical _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ was related to the ceasing growth of pollen tubes . to _PROTEIN_ pollen tube growth _PROTEIN_ must be removed from the apical _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . furthermore in the apical region the distribution of _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in the inverted cone was continually relocalized to the region of new growth when pollen tubes were reorienting their growth trajectories . real time imaging revealed that the growth rates of _PROTEIN_ ox and _PROTEIN_ pollen tubes were similar to that of the wild type . however _PROTEIN_ ox pollen tubes were constantly readjusting their growth directions exhibiting swinging growth trajectories whereas _PROTEIN_ pollen tubes _PROTEIN_ a clockwise bending under the microscope . these findings indicated that _PROTEIN_ is important for regulating the directionality of pollen tube growth . to further investigate the function of _PROTEIN_ in pollen tube directional growth we generated _PROTEIN_ protein mutants by site directed mutagenesis in which the glu or lys residues in the veekk motifs of _PROTEIN_ were mutated into ala or gly residues _PROTEIN_ . six _PROTEIN_ protein mutants were obtained . recombinant mutant proteins were prepared and purified for in vitro analyses . and were unable to sever f actin in the presence of although they still bound f actin with kd values that were similar to wild type _PROTEIN_ . by contrast there were no obvious differences in f actin severing activities between the other four mutant proteins and wild type _PROTEIN_ and all the mutant proteins could bind f actin in vitro . mutants and and _PROTEIN_ were chosen for further phenotypic observations and functional analyses . each _PROTEIN_ mutant was fused with _METHOD_ and introduced into _PROTEIN_ plants under the control of _PROTEIN_ promoter respectively . lines _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutant proteins to a level that is comparable to the _PROTEIN_ level of _PROTEIN_ in wild type plants were chosen for further analysis . pollen tubes and germinated in vitro exhibited no obvious defects in elongation and displayed the bending growth pattern characteristic of _PROTEIN_ pollen tubes . by contrast pollen tubes reduced the growth bending angle to a level that mimicked wild type tubes thereby compensating for the _PROTEIN_ phenotype . we subsequently investigated pollen tube growth in the stigma and style . similar to _PROTEIN_ pollen tubes and pollen tubes exhibited aberrant growth patterns . however pollen tubes grew relatively normally in pistils indicating that complemented _PROTEIN_ . quantification and statistical analysis indicated that the relative distance ratios of and were greater than those of wild type and pollen tubes whereas no significant differences between wild type and pollen tubes were observed . moreover the overall number of seeds in siliques was reduced substantially in and but not in in comparison to the wild type . we also examined the subcellular distributions of these three mutant proteins . green _METHOD_ of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ was detected on the flank _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and in the inverted cones of the apical regions of growing pollen tubes similar to wild type _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . these observations indicated that the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ was not altered with these protein mutations . therefore the effects on pollen tube growth and fertilization events observed in and mutants were likely due to their various f actin severing activities and not their subcellular distributions . in addition we observed the localization patterns of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ in root epidermal cells using _METHOD_ microscopy . as nontagged wild type _PROTEIN_ recognized by anti _PROTEIN_ antibody _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ and its mutant proteins were still partially colocalized with cortical microtubules in root cells . this further demonstrated the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ localization pattern of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutant proteins in pollen tubes was not an artifact caused by _METHOD_ tagging . together we conclude that the function of _PROTEIN_ in modulating f actin is crucial for pollen tube growth .
