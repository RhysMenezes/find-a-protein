here we compare the regulation and localization of the arabidopsis type iii phosphatidylinositol kinases _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in spodoptera frugiperda insect cells . we also explore the role of the pleckstrin homology domain in regulating _PROTEIN_ . recombinant kinase activity was found to be differentially sensitive to ptdins phosphate the product of the reaction . the specific activity of _PROTEIN_ was inhibited by mm . the effect of was not simply due to charge because _PROTEIN_ activity was stimulated approximately by equal concentrations of the other negatively charged lipids phosphatidic acid and phosphatidyl serine . furthermore inhibition of _PROTEIN_ by could be alleviated by adding recombinant _PROTEIN_ ph domain which selectively binds to . in contrast the specific activity of _PROTEIN_ which does not have a ph domain was stimulated fold by but not other negatively charged lipids . visualization of green _METHOD_ protein fusion proteins in insect cells revealed that _PROTEIN_ was associated primarily with _LOCATION_ in the perinuclear region whereas _PROTEIN_ was in the _LOCATION_ and associated with small vesicles throughout the cytoplasm . _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ without the ph domain in the insect cells compromised ptdins kinase activity and caused mislocalization of the kinase . the green _METHOD_ protein ph domain alone was associated with intracellular _LOCATION_ and the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . in vitro the ph domain appeared to be necessary for association of _PROTEIN_ with fine actin filaments . these studies support the idea that the arabidopsis type iii ptdins kinases are responsible for distinct phosphoinositide pools .
the full length _PROTEIN_ cdna was cloned by designing primers for pcr based on the _PROTEIN_ genomic sequence identified from the arabidopsis genome sequencing initiative on chromosome . the resulting cdna contained an open reading frame of nucleotides and encodes a protein with a predicted molecular _METHOD_ of kd and a pi of . when the cdna sequence was compared with the genomic sequence it was apparent that there were exons . this agreed with the putative splicing sites from the computer prediction performed by the arabidopsis sequencing initiative . comparison of the amino acid sequence of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ revealed that the two ptdins kinase _METHOD_ contained significant similarity in the catalytic lipid kinase domain and the lipid kinase unique domain but otherwise were dissimilar . a recent submission of genomic sequence from chromosome into genbank revealed a third putative ptdins kinase isoform designated _PROTEIN_ because it has significant predicted amino acid sequence identity to the _PROTEIN_ isoform . it is predicted to encode amino acids with a molecular _METHOD_ of approximately kd . the putative catalytic domain ph domain and the c terminal one half of the _PROTEIN_ lipid kinase unique domain are identical and similar to the same domains in _PROTEIN_ . the first one half of the n terminal putative lipid kinase unique domain of _PROTEIN_ contains amino acids that have only identity and similarity to _PROTEIN_ and no significant similarity to any other protein . we previously isolated endogenous _PROTEIN_ from solubilized arabidopsis microsomes by immunoaffinity purification . this technique gave low yields of unstable enzyme and the antiserum bound to and an unidentified kd polypeptide _PROTEIN_ therefore to compare the biochemical properties of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ we chose to _PROTEIN_ the full length arabidopsis kinases in baculovirus infected insect cells . the cells provide a robust eukaryotic recombinant protein synthesis system whereby recombinant polypeptides are properly processed and targeted within the cells . cells were infected with recombinant baculovirus particles harboring the desired cdnas for the indicated periods of time and production of the recombinant proteins was monitored by immunoblotting with anti _PROTEIN_ antiserum . under the assay conditions used at d after infection the _PROTEIN_ specific activity was consistently to fold higher than that of uninfected cells and to fold higher than that of cells _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ at d after infection . by d after infection the _PROTEIN_ protein was still being produced however the amount of functional enzyme _PROTEIN_ . in d cells _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ the recombinant enzyme accounted for greater than of the ptdins kinase specific activity and in d cells _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ the recombinant enzyme accounted for greater than of the specific activity . these respective lysates were used for the biochemical studies . classically adenosine and wortmannin sensitivity have been used as tools to characterize the ptdins kinases . we compared the effect of wortmannin and adenosine on the recombinant and _METHOD_ from arabidopsis . _PROTEIN_ activity was inhibited in the presence of wortmannin and by wortmannin . in contrast _PROTEIN_ was only inhibited by wortmannin at concentrations up to . adenosine has been shown in other _METHOD_ to inhibit ptdins kinases at concentrations ranging from for the type ii ptdins kinases to mm for the type iii ptdins kinases . both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ retained of their activity at adenosine . in contrast to type ii ptdins kinases which retain negligible activity at adenosine the plant ptdins kinase activities described thus far appear to be relatively insensitive to high concentrations of adenosine . this is typical of the type iii kinases . because the ptdins kinases are lipid kinases and must associate with phospholipids for activity and because the ph domain of _PROTEIN_ was previously shown to bind specifically to we explored the possibility that various phospholipids including might influence the activity of the ptdins kinases . equal amounts of insect cell lysates from cells overexpressing either _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ were pre incubated with and mm ptdoh ptdser or ptdcho delivered as triton x detergent lipid micelles and then assayed for ptdins kinase activity . the final concentrations of triton x and ptdins were kept constant for all reactions . control reactions were pre incubated with triton x alone instead of the detergent lipid micelles . as shown in figure the ptdins kinase _METHOD_ were affected differently by the presence of certain phospholipids . the most striking differences occurred when the product of the reaction was added . _PROTEIN_ was inhibited and by the presence of and mm respectively . the effect was specific for because mm resulted in a increase in the specific activity of _PROTEIN_ . in comparison both and increased _PROTEIN_ specific activity at low concentrations and increased the specific activity of _PROTEIN_ more than fold at higher concentrations . the differential effects of the ptdinsp isomers and offer a potentially distinctive mechanism of regulation for each of these type iii ptdins kinase _METHOD_ . a comparison of other negatively charged lipids and a zwitterionic lipid indicated that in contrast to the effect of ptdoh and ptdser increased the specific activity of _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ was affected by the negatively charged lipids to a lesser extent . specifically _PROTEIN_ specific activity increased up to when either mm ptdoh or ptdser were added whereas at the same concentrations ptdoh and ptdser increased the specific activity of _PROTEIN_ only to . ptdcho had no effect on _PROTEIN_ specific activity however mm ptdcho inhibited _PROTEIN_ specific activity by . to test the ability of the _PROTEIN_ ph domain to affect ptdins kinase activity we added purified recombinant ph domain to the lysates of insect cells overexpressing _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ . the addition of less than ph domain enhanced _PROTEIN_ activity over fold whereas the addition of the same amount of ph domain slightly _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ activity . these results are consistent with the finding that _PROTEIN_ is inhibited by whereas _PROTEIN_ is not . therefore when the ph domain is added to the _PROTEIN_ reaction mixture the polypeptide should bind to as it is synthesized and relieve product inhibition . the _PROTEIN_ in activity of the _PROTEIN_ isoform when high concentrations of ph domain peptide are added suggests that the production of normally enhances enzyme activity and is consistent with the data in figure . feedback inhibition of _PROTEIN_ could also be alleviated if the recombinant ph domain was coexpressed in the same cells with _PROTEIN_ . the ph domain cdna was co _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ in the insect cells and the lysates were assayed for ptdins kinase activity with and without the addition of mm . as can be seen in figure when the cells _PROTEIN_ only _PROTEIN_ the ptdins kinase specific activity was reduced by approximately in the presence of mm but when the cells produced the ph domain and the _PROTEIN_ polypeptides together the ptdins kinasespecific activity was inhibited less in the presence of mm . together these data and previous binding studies indicate that the _PROTEIN_ ph domain alleviates feedback inhibition of _PROTEIN_ activity by binding . to gain insight as to whether the ph domain was essential for _PROTEIN_ activity we constructed a deletion mutation in the _PROTEIN_ cdna designated _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ the mutant and the ph domain alone in insect cells . an identical time course of _PROTEIN_ was performed as described for the _PROTEIN_ of recombinant _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . optimal production for both the _PROTEIN_ and the ph domain polypeptides was found to be on the d after infection therefore cells producing these polypeptides were harvested after d and used in the subsequent studies . figure shows a comparison of the ptdins kinase activity of insect cell extracts that _PROTEIN_ the recombinant _METHOD_ of _PROTEIN_ cdna with and without its ph domain . figure is a western blot using the anti _PROTEIN_ antibody to identify the recombinant _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and ph domain polypeptides and to show that they were produced at approximately equally amounts . insect cells _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were used as an infection control for comparison of ptdins kinase activity . cells overproducing _METHOD_ consistently had less ptdins kinase activity than uninfected cells . figure shows the autoradiogram of the tlc plate that separated the radioactive products of the ptdins kinase assay and figure shows the quantification of the labeled . insect cells overexpressing the full length _PROTEIN_ had fold higher ptdins kinase specific activity than cells overexpressing the _METHOD_ cdna . cells that were _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ had greatly reduced ptdins kinase activity compared with those _PROTEIN_ full length _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ was fold more active than _PROTEIN_ . interestingly cells overproducing the ph domain itself had lowered endogenous ptdins kinase specific activity compared with cells overproducing _METHOD_ which suggested that the ph domain was interfering with endogenous ptdins kinases of the insect cells or that overproduction of the ph domain was toxic to the cells . table i shows the specific activity of the affinity purified _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ polypeptides . when the specific activity of _PROTEIN_ in insect cell lysates was compared with that of purified _PROTEIN_ it was evident that the enzyme lost activity during purification implying that there might be some cellular cofactors that enhanced or stabilized the ptdins kinase activity of _PROTEIN_ . this appears to be a common problem among ptdins kinases because the activity of recombinant bovine brain _PROTEIN_ was also compromised as it was purified . purified _PROTEIN_ exhibited a reduction in activity compared with the full length _PROTEIN_ . these data show that when the ph domain was deleted from the ptdins kinase the activity was greatly compromised and the ph domain was necessary for optimal ptdins kinase activity and/or protein folding . when purified ph domain was added back to the purified _PROTEIN_ polypeptide the ptdins kinase activity was enhanced almost fold but did not recover to the specific activity of the full length _PROTEIN_ . these data suggested that at least some of the effect of the ph domain deletion in the purified protein could be rescued by the addition of the peptide domain . a comparison of the specific activities of purified recombinant _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ an additional function proposed for some ph domains aside from binding polyphosphoinositides is binding and modulating f actin . f actin binding regions of the ph domains of oxysterol binding protein and btk were mapped to the amino terminal ends that were rich in basic amino acids . the ph domain of _PROTEIN_ has a similar region of basic amino acids and an f actin fraction had been shown previously to be enriched in _PROTEIN_ therefore we considered the hypothesis that the ph domain of _PROTEIN_ might play a role in the association of _PROTEIN_ with the f actin enriched fraction of the cell . to test this hypothesis we assessed the ability of the recombinant _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ polypeptides to associate with polymerized f actin in vitro . extracts from cells that were overexpressing _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were solubilized in triton x and then centrifuged at or to obtain a supernatant devoid of insoluble proteins aggregates and polymerized f actin . the supernatants were then treated to enhance the polymerization of the remaining endogenous g actin by the addition of kcl and as described in materials and methods . after polymerization had occurred the samples were again centrifuged at or respectively . figure reveals that the distribution of _PROTEIN_ was equal between the supernatant and the pellet at and that more of _PROTEIN_ resided in the f actin pellet . in contrast _PROTEIN_ was more prevalent in the supernatant than the pellet and was detected only in the supernatant in fraction . these data imply that although both _PROTEIN_ and to a lesser extent _PROTEIN_ may associate with the larger f actin filaments that were sedimented at only _PROTEIN_ preferentially associated with the fine filaments that were sedimented at . the western blot of actin showing an increased distribution of actin in the pellet when the full length _PROTEIN_ was present suggested that in the presence of the full length ptdins kinase proportionally more of the fine filaments were recovered . these data suggest that the ph domain of _PROTEIN_ may play a role in associating _PROTEIN_ with actin filaments and that this interaction may enhance fine filament formation . to determine whether there were differences in the subcellular localization of the different _METHOD_ of the arabidopsis ptdins kinases in cells and whether the ph domain played a role in the localization of _PROTEIN_ we constructed _METHOD_ fusion proteins for baculovirus _PROTEIN_ and visualized the localization of the fusion proteins with using laser scanning confocal microscopy . to avoid potential _METHOD_ or artifacts from overproduction of recombinant polypeptides and to avoid the effects of _PROTEIN_ stage viral infection on the cell morphology we visualized cells h after infection . figure shows a western blot of the _METHOD_ fusion proteins present in the insect cells after d of infection probed with anti _PROTEIN_ and anti _METHOD_ antibodies . the immunoblots show that the fusion proteins are correctly synthesized intact with no breakdown products . the polypeptide representing _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ could not be identified by immunoblotting presumably because of low _PROTEIN_ levels after only d. however immunoblots of extracts from identical cells overexpressing _PROTEIN_ for d revealed intact _METHOD_ fusion proteins . as seen in figure the _METHOD_ fusion proteins are readily detected and show differences in their distribution within the transgenic cells . _METHOD_ alone _PROTEIN_ in the insect cells was widely distributed throughout the cell both in the cytoplasm and the _LOCATION_ . _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was excluded from the _LOCATION_ and appeared to be mostly associated with perinuclear _LOCATION_ . in contrast _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ appeared to be more evenly dispersed throughout the _LOCATION_ and not obviously associated with any particular _LOCATION_ component indicating that the ph domain was necessary for the association of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ to perinuclear _LOCATION_ . the _METHOD_ from the _METHOD_ ph domain had a very different appearance with a striking punctate _METHOD_ associated with what appeared to be membranous components throughout the _LOCATION_ and the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . finally the _METHOD_ associated with the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was primarily located in the cytoplasm with increased _METHOD_ around dispersed cytoplasmic vesicles .
the cdna for _PROTEIN_ was amplified from arabidopsis rna by rtpcr using primers that were designed based on the predicted open reading frame found on chromosome and that correspond with our previously described partial cdna for _PROTEIN_ . the sequence of the sense primer was _PROTEIN_ gag gca ctg acg gag ctt and the antisense primer sequence was tta ctt ctc _PROTEIN_ gcc _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ caa _PROTEIN_ . a region of kb was amplified using platinum taq dna high fidelity dna polymerase from cdna synthesized from arabidopsis whole plant poly rna . the kb pcr product was subcloned into pbluescript . the cdna was sequenced in its entirety by the iowa state sequencing facility . multiple pcr products were sequenced and compared with the genomic sequence to obtain a clone devoid of mutations . the full length cdna for the open reading frame of _PROTEIN_ was amplified from arabidopsis cdna with primers that were designed based on the computer prediction of the open reading frame of _PROTEIN_ sequenced on chromosome from the arabidopsis genome sequencing initiative . this sequence corresponds to that of _PROTEIN_ identified by xue et al . . the kb pcr product was subcloned into pcr blunt and sequenced by the iowa state sequencing facility . multiple pcr products were sequenced to find an un mutated cdna . to delete the ph domain sequence from the _PROTEIN_ cdna a kb partial cdna containing the one half of the _PROTEIN_ cdna was used initially to make the ph domain deletion . pcr primers were designed to amplify the cdna on either side of the ph domain sequence . the primer sequences for cdna amplification downstream of the ph domain were sense _PROTEIN_ cgg cag gga _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ tgc and antisense aaa _PROTEIN_ cga ctt act tct cga tg . the primers used for upstream amplification were sense gga ccg _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ cta aa and antisense gca _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ tcc ctg ccg aac ctg . the primers that amplified the cdna on either side of the ph domain were designed so that their sequences were complimentary to the nucleotides that flank the ph domain sequence on the opposite side of which they annealed . the resulting pcr products were gel purified and then placed into another pcr amplification reaction in a ratio with each other and with the primers that amplify the extreme ends of either fragment . a faint band that resulted from the amplification of the two fragments together was gel purified reamplified and subcloned into pcr blunt . the newly formed cdna of the one half of _PROTEIN_ with a deleted ph domain was sequenced to verify deletion of the ph domain sequence and to check for any additional mutations that may have been incorporated by the dna polymerase in the process of making the deletion . the above cdna fragment containing the ph domain deletion and the full length _PROTEIN_ cdna in pbluescript were digested at the end sali site and an internal bamhi site that was upstream of the ph domain sequence . the resulting fragments were gel purified and ligated together . correct ligation was verified by sequence analysis . the cdna encoding the _PROTEIN_ ph domain was amplified by pcr using pfu dna polymerase with primers that were complimentary to either end of the ph domain sequence . the sense primer contained a bamhi site on its end and the antisense primer contained an ecori site on its end for efficient subcloning of the cdna into _PROTEIN_ vectors . the cdna encoding soluble _METHOD_ was amplified by several different primers that were engineered with various restriction sites on their ends so that the resulting _METHOD_ cdna could be efficiently ligated in frame with the ptdins kinase cdnas . in every case the pcr amplified cdna was verified for sequence integrity . the cdnas encoding _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ the ph domain _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ ph domain were each subcloned in frame with the n terminal polyhis tag of the pfastbac ht plasmid . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were subcloned into the ecori and sali sites of the pfastbac ht plasmid . _PROTEIN_ was subcloned using noti and sali sites . the cdna encoding the _PROTEIN_ ph domain was amplified by pcr with a high fidelity dna polymerase with primers that had a bamhi site on the end of the sense primer and an ecori site on the end of the antisense primer . the amplified pcr product was cloned into the pfastbac ht plasmid via the bamhi and ecori sites . primers containing restriction sites for noti on the sense primer and sali on the antisense primer were used to generate _METHOD_ for ligating in frame with the end of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in the pfastbac ht plasmid . primers containing noti and xbai sites were used to amplify _METHOD_ for in frame ligation to the end of _PROTEIN_ . primers containing ecori and sali were used to amplify _METHOD_ for in frame ligation to the end of the ph domain sequence . serum free spodoptera frugiperda cells were obtained from life technologies/gibco brl and _PROTEIN_ at at a concentration of to cells ml in sf ii insect cell serum free medium . the cells were _PROTEIN_ as to ml suspension cultures in ml shaker flasks with loosened caps and shaken in an air regulated incubator at rpm . the _PROTEIN_ system used was the bac to bac baculovirus _PROTEIN_ system . recombinant baculoviruses were generated from the recombinant _PROTEIN_ vectors according to the manufacturer 's recommendations . for recombinant polypeptide production a monolayer of cells was infected at a multiplicity of infection of for to d depending on the recombinant virus . optimal production of _PROTEIN_ and the ph domain polypeptide was on the d after infection and optimal production of _PROTEIN_ was on the d after infection . all assays were performed using cells optimally producing the respective polypeptide . infected cells were then harvested by pouring off the media rinsing with cold phosphate buffered saline and shaking the cells loose by hand five times in the presence of lysis buffer . cells were then sonicated four times for s on ice and cell debris was removed by centrifugation at for min . the cleared lysate was analyzed for protein concentration by the bradford method and assayed for ptdins kinase activity . arabidopsis plants were coarsely macerated and ground in a virtis homogenizer with an equal volume of ice cold buffer containing mm edta mm egta mm tris mm suc mm mercaptoethanol mm dithiothreitol mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride mg per ml leupeptin and mm benzamidine . the homogenate was filtered through cheesecloth and centrifuged at for min at . the supernatant was centrifuged at for min at . the microsomal pellet was resuspended with the original grinding volume in ice cold deionized water and the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ were isolated by aqueous two phase partitioning as described by wheeler and boss . the _LOCATION_ fractions were assayed for protein concentration according to the bradford method and equal concentrations of proteins were separated by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and electroblotted onto pvdf for immunodetection . triton x solubilization was used to release the polypeptide from a triton insoluble fraction and this enhanced the cross reaction of the kd polypeptide with the antibody over _LOCATION_ that were untreated with detergent . five to eight _METHOD_ of the lysate of insect cells _PROTEIN_ recombinant polypeptides were assayed in duplicate . the reaction mixture contained final concentrations of mm mm sodium molybdate mg ml ptdins triton x mm _PROTEIN_ mm tris and _PROTEIN_ in a total volume of . stock ptdins was solubilized in triton x . the reactions were mixed by vortexing and incubated at for min with intermittent shaking . the reactions were stopped by adding ml of ice cold meoh and kept at until the lipids were extracted . lipids were extracted dried separated by tlc and analyzed with a bioscan system imaging scanner as previously described . lipids were prepared as detergent micelles by first solubilizing the lipids in meoh and then dried under a constant stream of gas to form a uniform layer of lipid along the glass test tube . once dried the lipids were solubilized with vigorous vortexing to a final stock concentration of mg ml in triton x in mm tris . lipids that were added to the ptdins kinase assay were incubated with the sample for min before the addition of substrate and _PROTEIN_ . insect cell lysates _PROTEIN_ recombinant _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ were lysed as described above solubilized in triton x and centrifuged at at for h or for min at . one hundred micromolar kcl and mm were added to the resulting supernatants to enhance actin polymerization . the solutions were incubated for h at . the samples were then centrifuged again at either or for h or min at respectively . the entire resulting pellet and supernatant was loaded onto an _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ gel and subjected to immunoblot analysis with either the polyclonal anti ptdins kinase antibody or a monoclonal anti actin antibody . cells grown in suspension and _PROTEIN_ the recombinant _METHOD_ alone or as fusion proteins to _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and the ph domain of _PROTEIN_ were visualized by lscm d postinfection . the confocal images were obtained using a leica rxa _METHOD_ microscope equipped with a leica pl apo na oil immersion lens . the microscope was attached to a leica tcs sp laser scanning head and the images were acquired using leica tcs nt software . light paths and wavelengths were controlled using a triple dichroic filter . _METHOD_ was excited at nm using an argon laser and _METHOD_ _METHOD_ emission was recorded at to nm . identical electronic parameters were used for all images . simultaneous differential interference contrast images were recorded using a transmitted light detector . upon request all novel materials described in this
