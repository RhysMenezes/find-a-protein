the closely related proteins _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ represent the group ie clade of arabidopsis formin homologues . the subcellular localization of these proteins and their ability to affect the actin _LOCATION_ were examined . _PROTEIN_ protein activity was identified using fluorimetric techniques . interactions between arabidopsis profilin _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ were assayed in vitro and in vivo using assays and . the subcellular localization of group ie formins was observed with indirect _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and an green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ fusion construct _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ protein affected actin dynamics in vitro and assays suggested interactions with the protein profilin in vivo . indirect _METHOD_ showed that _PROTEIN_ localized specifically to the cell _LOCATION_ at borders between adjoining cells . _PROTEIN_ of an _PROTEIN_ fusion protein resulted in _METHOD_ localization to cell _LOCATION_ zones similar to _PROTEIN_ . furthermore aberrant _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ resulted in the inhibition of root hair elongation . taken together these data suggest that the group ie formins act with profilin to regulate actin polymerization at specific sites associated with the cell _LOCATION_ .
group ie arabidopsis formins _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were cloned by pcr amplification from cdna and library screening respectively . sequencing of the transcripts confirmed that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ share a high level of sequence identity a higher level of identity than any other subset of group i formins . previous attempts to classify plant formins were based on comparisons between _PROTEIN_ domain sequences . figure shows a phylogeny produced using group i sequences including the variable domains that are possibly required for localization and regulation . the topology of the dendrogram is similar to that of a previously published tree based solely upon _PROTEIN_ domain comparison in particular the highly supported grouping of sequences previously classified as subclades ic and ie _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ has been recovered . in addition to retaining _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ domains at their both _METHOD_ also contain a novel region encompassing a cell _LOCATION_ signal sorting sequence and transmembrane domain . the sequence bridging the gap between the transmembrane domain and the _PROTEIN_ domain is unique to _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . approximately of this linker sequence is also conserved at the very of the remaining arabidopsis group ie member _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ domains of formins are known to affect actin dynamics by enhancing nucleation . assays to measure the bulk in vitro rate of actin polymerization recorded such activity as a reduction in lag phase and as an increase in the rate of polymerization as the multiplication of available filament ends produced via nucleation accelerated the accumulation of . analysis of actin polymerization in the presence and absence of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ by measurement of pyrene _METHOD_ showed that _PROTEIN_ significantly reduced the reaction lag phase and increased the slope of the polymerization curve . interaction with the small protein profilin via the _PROTEIN_ domain is essential for the activity of the _PROTEIN_ domain in vivo and for the partial capping behaviour of some formins in vitro . two _METHOD_ of arabidopsis profilin were cloned in order to assess _PROTEIN_ profilin interactions . _PROTEIN_ is a relatively highly and widely _PROTEIN_ arabidopsis profilin isoform while _PROTEIN_ is restricted to gametophytic tissues . both profilins were _PROTEIN_ as _PROTEIN_ fusions and glutathione beads coated with _PROTEIN_ profilin and _PROTEIN_ alone were incubated with _PROTEIN_ and the _PROTEIN_ domain of _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ fragment associated with _PROTEIN_ beads but not beads coated with _PROTEIN_ alone . the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ domain fragment was not pulled down by beads suggesting that the profilin interaction domain is contained within the region that encompasses the _PROTEIN_ motif . profilin formin interactions can also be readily detected in vivo by the system . arabidopsis profilins _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and the formin fragment _PROTEIN_ were cloned into vectors _PROTEIN_ and . of the two _METHOD_ only _PROTEIN_ was capable of activating _PROTEIN_ in combination with _PROTEIN_ . this raises the intriguing possibility that plant formins in vivo may be isoform selective . formin function in vivo is highly dependent upon subcellular localization . the regional accumulation of formin protein is thought to influence local actin dynamics and contribute to the formation of organized arrays . to observe _PROTEIN_ localization a fragment of the of _PROTEIN_ fused to a was used to raise polyclonal antibodies from mice . before injection the identity of this protein was confirmed using _PROTEIN_ laser desorption/ionization time of flight analysis . probing of a western blot of arabidopsis tissues showed that the antibodies isolated from mice bound stringently to a single species of approximately kda from a wide variety of arabidopsis organs . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are the only group i formins predicted to have a molecular weight of kda . sections of arabidopsis tissue stained with the antibody were observed using confocal indirect _METHOD_ microscopy . control observations using secondary antibodies were made to confirm the specificity of the antibody . figure shows groupings of leaf and cotyledon mesophyll cells with _PROTEIN_ localized to contact points . in some examples _PROTEIN_ was constricted to a single boundary between two tightly coupled neighbours . however in most groups of cells showing _PROTEIN_ staining _PROTEIN_ could be observed at multiple junctions showing that the localization of _PROTEIN_ was not restricted to the of the most recent cell division . a weak diffuse signal could also be observed in the cytoplasm of some cells . _PROTEIN_ was also localized to the boundaries of cuboid cells of the leaf and cotyledon petioles and was particularly enriched at transverse contacts . the extent of conservation between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ suggested that _PROTEIN_ should have a similar subcellular localization pattern to _PROTEIN_ . to test this hypothesis _METHOD_ was fused to the of a truncated fragment of _PROTEIN_ that lacked the _PROTEIN_ domain _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ domain is essential for actin nucleation and capping activity and map/microtubule interactions and was consequently removed to minimize cytoskeletal disruption and to determine whether consistent with other formins the of _PROTEIN_ contains the majority of domains required for localization . _METHOD_ _METHOD_ within mesophyll cells from plants transformed with the _PROTEIN_ construct could not be reliably observed because of the intense _METHOD_ of chloroplasts however _METHOD_ could be observed in cortical root cells . figure shows _PROTEIN_ enriched along transverse cell walls in a similar manner to _PROTEIN_ distribution in cuboid cells . diffuse _PROTEIN_ could also be observed in the cytoplasm . an increase in _METHOD_ _METHOD_ concomitant with ethanol treatment suggests that the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ is enhanced by ethanol induction . _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ construct caused the growth arrest of populations of root trichoblasts . this phenotype was observed in multiple transgenic lines and was studied in detail in two lines originating from independent transformation experiments . in all cases where root hair reduction was observed only a part of the root system of the _PROTEIN_ plants appeared to be affected which was consistent with the somewhat patchy _PROTEIN_ pattern observed also by _METHOD_ microscopy of induced roots . the frequency of seedlings with a reduced amount of root hairs significantly differed between the _PROTEIN_ transgenic lines and any of the empty vector controls while differences between any two controls as well as between the two _PROTEIN_ lines were insignificant . _PROTEIN_ plants differed significantly from their noninduced counterparts and from induced controls . detailed quantitative measurements of the percentage of root length exhibiting reduced root hair development for one of the _PROTEIN_ lines also revealed significant differences _PROTEIN_ amongst the four plant groups studied . application of ethanol was found to have a significant effect on the _PROTEIN_ transgenic line but not on the control line . overall these data show that root hair growth arrest correlates with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . root hairs pass through distinct stages of development including patterning bulge formation and elongation . root hair bulge formation is known to be actin independent while the tightly focused tip growth of root hair elongation requires . detailed observation of trichoblasts within _PROTEIN_ affected areas showed that root hairs appeared to be arrested predominantly at or even before bulge growth . many root hairs in affected zones can therefore progress through the earliest stages of development but are unable to achieve the transition to tip growth .
