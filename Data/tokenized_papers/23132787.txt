in prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells the exonucleolytic decay and processing of rnas are essential for rna metabolism . however the understanding of the mechanism of exonucleolytic decay in plants is very limited . here we report the characterization of an arabidopsis transfer dna insertional mutant that shows severe growth defects in early seedling growth including delayed germination and cotyledon expansion thinner yellow/pale green leaves and a slower growth rate . high efficiency thermal asymmetric interlaced polymerase chain reaction analysis showed that the insertional locus was in the sixth exon of _PROTEIN_ encoding a predicted exonuclease that contained a conserved rnase phosphorolytic domain with high similarity to _PROTEIN_ designated _PROTEIN_ . interestingly we detected highly accumulated messenger rnas that encode seed storage protein and abscisic acid biosynthesis and signaling pathway related protein during the early growth stage in _PROTEIN_ mutants . the mrna decay kinetics analysis for seed storage proteins cis epoxycarotenoid dioxygenases and aba insensitives revealed that _PROTEIN_ catalyzed the decay of these mrnas in the cytoplasm . consistent with these results the _PROTEIN_ mutant was more sensitive to aba in germination and root growth than wild type plants whereas overexpression lines of _PROTEIN_ were more resistant to aba in germination and root growth than wild type plants . _PROTEIN_ was localized to both the cytoplasm and _LOCATION_ and _PROTEIN_ was preferentially _PROTEIN_ in seedlings . altogether our results showed that _PROTEIN_ plays an important role in seed germination and early seedling growth by mediating specific cytoplasmic mrna decay in arabidopsis .
we identified a t dna insertional mutant from approximately individual arabidopsis plants derived from approximately parents transformed with the t dna of agrobacterium tumefaciens binary vector pcambia based on its extremely slow growth phenotype designated slower growth . to genetically characterize the mutant the slg line was backcrossed with the wild type parent . the seed germination and growth of progeny appeared to be normal similar to wild type plants . the progeny from the self pollinated showed a segregation of the slg phenotype of to corresponding to segregation of approximately one to three on murashige and skoog _METHOD_ medium with hygromycin . the seedlings showing resistance to hygromycin and a slow growth phenotype were homozygous for the t dna determined by pcr . the seedlings showing resistance to hygromycin and normal morphology similar to wild type plants were heterozygous . these data suggest that the slg mutant was recessive and segregated as a single _LOCATION_ locus linked to the hygromycin resistance marker . to identify the corresponding slg gene we performed hitail pcr for the t dna insertion site . the sequencing of the hitail pcr products suggested that the t dna was inserted bp downstream of the start codon in the sixth exon of _PROTEIN_ . the gene included seven introns and seven exons and encoded a amino acid protein . it was predicted to be a exonuclease with a conserved rnase ph domain . the arabidopsis genome has predicted rnase ph containing proteins . semiquantitative reverse transcription pcr indicated that slg was a transcript truncated mutant . the pcr analysis using primers specific for t dna and the genomic dna indicated that all of the seedlings that displayed a slow growth phenotype were homozygous . in previous studies _PROTEIN_ was thought to be one core subunit of the exosome a homolog of yeast or _PROTEIN_ . we performed further phylogenetic analysis of the arabidopsis rnase ph domain containing proteins and yeast _PROTEIN_ and . the results showed that slg was most closely related to yeast _PROTEIN_ . multiple gene alignment analysis showed that slg shared identity and similarity with arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . thus slg was renamed _PROTEIN_ like _PROTEIN_ and the mutant was renamed _PROTEIN_ accordingly . the homozygous _PROTEIN_ t dna insertion mutant was characterized in detail . under normal conditions the _PROTEIN_ mutant displayed various defects in early development . the seed germination of _PROTEIN_ occurred _PROTEIN_ than in wild type plants and the difference was most distinct h after the end of stratification . no obvious distinction was observed and the germination percentages of all types of seeds were greater than after h . the cotyledons of the _PROTEIN_ mutant expanded slowly and often accumulated anthocyanins around their margins . the _PROTEIN_ mutant also displayed yellow green cotyledons and pale green early stage rosette leaves . consistent with this phenotype we found a significant reduction of chlorophyll content in one to six rosette leaves from week old _PROTEIN_ mutant plants compared with wild type plants . the chlorophyll content of wild type leaves was fresh weight whereas the chlorophyll content in _PROTEIN_ was reduced by nearly with only fresh weight . the chlorophyll a/b ratio was reduced from in wild type plants to in _PROTEIN_ . additionally in _PROTEIN_ leaf size and _PROTEIN_ were reduced the petiole was shorter and the leaf margins displayed deep serrations compared with wild type plants . the _PROTEIN_ mutant grew more slowly than wild type plants especially during the early stage of development . after bolting the development of the mutant gradually recovered and finally was only shorter than wild type plants . total chlorophyll was obtained from mg of rosette leaves to of week old wild type _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and plants . the ratio of chlorophyll a to chlorophyll b was calculated by spectrophotometric quantification . values shown are fresh weight . data shown are means sd of three independent biological determinations . we further analyzed internal leaf anatomy using light microscopy . a reduced density and irregular shape of mesophyll cells were observed in the _PROTEIN_ mutant making the distinction between the palisade and spongy layers difficult . the leaves of the _PROTEIN_ mutant were also thinner . further transmission electron microscopy showed that the chloroplast size and ultrastructure in the _PROTEIN_ mutant appeared normal similar to wild type plants . scanning electron microscopy showed the details of the adaxial surface epidermises in the wild type and _PROTEIN_ mutant leaves . the surface of _PROTEIN_ was completely crumpled and the epidermal cells were irregularly shaped in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . to confirm unequivocally that disruption of the _PROTEIN_ gene indeed resulted in all of the phenotypic alterations observed in the mutant we introduced a bp dna fragment that included the genomic fragment of _PROTEIN_ and bp sequences upstream from the initiation codon into the homozygote _PROTEIN_ for genetic complementation . a total of seven complementation _PROTEIN_ lines were generated and transcripts were detected by rt pcr . all _PROTEIN_ lines exhibited normal morphology similar to wild type plants . _PROTEIN_ line was selected for further analysis . we also measured the concentration of chlorophyll in the leaves of _PROTEIN_ plants which was nearly equal to wild type plants . altogether these data indicate that the disruption of _PROTEIN_ was responsible for the _PROTEIN_ mutant phenotype . simultaneously we generated a construct harboring _PROTEIN_ complementary dna under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus promoter . seven homozygous transgenic oe lines were obtained and their _PROTEIN_ transcript levels were detected by rt pcr . two lines and were selected for further analysis . under normal conditions and displayed slightly but significantly faster seed germination and cotyledon expansion than wild type plants . no obvious difference was observed in the rosette leaf size and morphology anatomic structure and ultrastructure chlorophyll content and plant stature in the _PROTEIN_ growth stage between the oe lines and wild type plants . to investigate the intracellular distribution of _PROTEIN_ we constructed an _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein _PROTEIN_ under the control of a cauliflower mosaic virus promoter which rescued the _PROTEIN_ mutant phenotype in our experiment . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and red _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ an _PROTEIN_ rich dna sequence _PROTEIN_ hook motif _LOCATION_ localized protein were transiently coexpressed in living arabidopsis protoplasts . we found that the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein was localized to both the cytoplasm and _LOCATION_ in contrast to the _LOCATION_ distribution of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . consistent localization was shown in the d old root cells of stable arabidopsis transformants . to visualize the temporal and spatial _PROTEIN_ patterns of _PROTEIN_ in plant tissue a bp promoter fragment of _PROTEIN_ was fused with the gus gene to generate transgenic plants . fifteen independent transgenic lines were obtained and more than six lines were stained and observed . gus activity was detected in all of the organs with the exception of the _METHOD_ . interestingly we found strong activity in imbibed seeds and seedlings . however barely detectable gus activity was found in _PROTEIN_ rosette leaves in week old plants . a similar _PROTEIN_ pattern was observed in six independent lines . consistent results were obtained by quantitative reverse transcription pcr . overall these data show that _PROTEIN_ is preferentially _PROTEIN_ in early stage seedlings . based on the _PROTEIN_ mutant phenotype we examined the levels of transcripts that encode proteins related to photosynthesis starch synthesis seed maturation the aba biosynthesis and signaling pathways and the ga biosynthesis and signaling pathways using qrt pcr . four day old _PROTEIN_ mutant seedlings were used because of their distinctive phenotype compared with wild type seedlings . the results showed that the levels of the transcripts that encode photosynthetic starch synthesis and ga biosynthesis and signaling pathway related proteins accumulated almost normally in the _PROTEIN_ mutant compared with wild type plants . however highly accumulated mrnas that encode _PROTEIN_ were detected . we found that of the mrnas tested were increased more than fold in mutant compared with wild type plants . moreover the mrnas of key enzymes for aba biosynthesis _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and aba signaling transcription _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ also accumulated in _PROTEIN_ mutants suggesting that aba levels and signaling could be enhanced in _PROTEIN_ . consistent with these results slight or moderate _PROTEIN_ in the transcript levels of most of the _PROTEIN_ tested _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ nced _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were detected in the line . no significant difference was detected in the _PROTEIN_ line . qrt pcr analysis of transcripts in d old wild type _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and seedlings is shown . the _PROTEIN_ level in the wild type was set at . the means of three replicates of qrt pcr and sd values are shown . similar results were obtained when qrt pcr was performed using a second set of samples . dashes indicate transcripts that were not detected . _PROTEIN_ has been predicted to have exoribonuclease activity and to catalyze rna decay . therefore we analyzed the in vivo decay kinetics of six mrnas for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ that accumulate in _PROTEIN_ . four day old seedlings were treated with cordycepin a drug that confers strong transcription blockade and qrt pcr was performed . we found that the decay of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mrnas was strongly diminished but not completely stopped in _PROTEIN_ suggesting that these mrnas are substrates for _PROTEIN_ but they must also be substrates for other rna decay pathways . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mrna decay was almost undetectable in _PROTEIN_ compared with wild type plants suggesting that _PROTEIN_ is the only pathway for this mrna decay during early seedling growth . the decay of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mrnas was faster in the line than in wild type plants . no obvious difference was observed in the _PROTEIN_ line . since the mrnas of aba biosynthesis and signaling pathway related proteins were highly accumulated during the early growth stage in _PROTEIN_ we examined the response of the _PROTEIN_ mutant and oe lines to aba . as expected the _PROTEIN_ mutant was more sensitive to aba in seed germination cotyledon greening and root growth than wild type plants . in contrast to _PROTEIN_ the oe lines were more resistant to aba in seed germination cotyledon greening and root growth compared with wild type plants . these results further confirmed the role of _PROTEIN_ in the regulation of aba synthesis and/or signaling . _PROTEIN_ shares identity and similarity with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis and they are all closely related to yeast _PROTEIN_ . citation identified up regulated mrnas in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ using tiling arrays . to investigate whether mutations in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ affect common mrnas we randomly chose mrnas from the mrnas that were identified to be up regulated in the _PROTEIN_ mutant and examined their transcript levels in _PROTEIN_ using qrt pcr . the results showed only slight increases or _PROTEIN_ in these mrna levels compared with wild type plants . we also compared the up regulated mrnas in _PROTEIN_ examined by qrt pcr with mrnas revealed using tiling arrays in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . no mrna overlap was found with the exception of _PROTEIN_ . these data suggest that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ function distinctively and thus _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutations result in different phenotypes .
