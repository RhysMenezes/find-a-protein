uptake of external sulfate from the environment and use of internal _LOCATION_ sulfate pools are two important aspects of the acquisition of sulfur for metabolism . in this study we demonstrated that the _LOCATION_ type sulfate transporter facilitates the efflux of sulfate from the _LOCATION_ and plays critical roles in optimizing the internal distribution of sulfate in arabidopsis thaliana . green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ fusion proteins were _PROTEIN_ under the control of their own promoters in transgenic arabidopsis . the fusion proteins were accumulated specifically in the tonoplast _LOCATION_ and were localized predominantly in the pericycle and xylem parenchyma cells of roots and hypocotyls . in roots was constantly accumulated _PROTEIN_ of the changes of sulfur conditions whereas became abundant by sulfur limitation . in shoots both transporters were accumulated by sulfur limitation . _LOCATION_ isolated from callus of the double knockout showed excess accumulation of sulfate which was substantially _PROTEIN_ by overexpression of _METHOD_ . in seedlings the supplied sulfate was retained in the root tissue of the double knockout mutant . comparison of the double and single knockouts suggested that plays a major role and has a supplementary function . overexpression of _METHOD_ significantly _PROTEIN_ accumulation of sulfate in the root tissue complementing the phenotype of the double mutant . these results suggested that type transporters particularly actively mediate the efflux of sulfate from the _LOCATION_ lumen into the cytoplasm and influence the capacity for _LOCATION_ storage of sulfate in the root tissue . the efflux function will promote rapid turnover of sulfate from the _LOCATION_ particularly in the vasculature under conditions of low sulfur supply which will optimize the symplastic flux of sulfate channeled toward the xylem vessels .
two distinct tonoplast localizing sulfate transporters and have been identified in arabidopsis . localization of and transporters in the tonoplast was determined by _PROTEIN_ gene green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ fusion constructs in arabidopsis . _METHOD_ was fused in frame to the c terminus of and and _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis under the control of the and promoter sequences respectively . the _METHOD_ tagged proteins accumulated in membranous structures typical of tonoplasts in _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ plants . _METHOD_ of _METHOD_ in the root tips of _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ plants presented clear views of tonoplast localization . localization of _METHOD_ in the tonoplast was confirmed by merging the signals of _METHOD_ with a red _METHOD_ dye which translocates to the tonoplast _LOCATION_ by endocytosis . _METHOD_ and were colocalized in _METHOD_ plants providing yellow staining of tonoplasts in the overlaid image . in addition _METHOD_ in the tonoplast was clearly distinguishable from the endocytotic vesicles where part of dye localizes during staining . _METHOD_ plants showed the same results indicating colocalization of the signals of _METHOD_ and on the tonoplasts . in the shoots there was specific localization of _METHOD_ in the tonoplast of the vascular parenchyma cells of hypocotyls in both plant lines . localization of _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ fusion proteins was clearly observed in the tonoplast of other cell types as presented in figure . these results indicated that and are tonoplast localizing transporters in arabidopsis . previously the n terminal region of the arabidopsis sulfate transporter was suggested to encode a chloroplastic transit peptide based on computer predictions and biolistic transformation . _METHOD_ fused to the n terminal amino acid residues or _METHOD_ replacing the c terminal amino acid residues of did not display tonoplast localization suggesting an essential region within the c terminus of for proper assembly of transporters to the tonoplast _LOCATION_ . a conserved amino acid sequence eplls was found in this particular region of and homologous ests from soybean and alfalfa . furthermore pattern matching indicated existence of this sequence within the c and n terminal hydrophilic regions of the _PROTEIN_ sodium/proton antiporter and an mrp like abc transporter similar to the _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ localizing glutathione conjugate transporter respectively . cell type specific _PROTEIN_ of and was investigated in _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ transgenic arabidopsis plants _PROTEIN_ the gene _METHOD_ fusion constructs . both the and the promoters resulted in strong _PROTEIN_ of the _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ fusion proteins predominantly in the vasculatures of roots and hypocotyls . in _METHOD_ plants _METHOD_ of _METHOD_ was detected in roots and hypocotyls occurring from the root tip to the basal region . in roots the _METHOD_ signal was predominantly present in the pericycle and parenchyma cells of the vascular tissues . epidermis cortex and endodermis of the mature part of root showed weak _PROTEIN_ however the levels were not appreciable compared with those observed in the vascular tissues . in hypocotyls _METHOD_ was _PROTEIN_ strongly in the vasculature . the _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ was observed predominantly in the mature part of roots close to the shoot/root junction and in the hypocotyls . _METHOD_ plants presented strong _METHOD_ when grown on a low sulfur medium . in roots the signals of _METHOD_ were detected in the pericycles and parenchyma cells within the vascular tissues which resembles the cell type specificity of _METHOD_ . within the hypocotyls _METHOD_ was _PROTEIN_ abundantly in the vasculature and epidermis but was _PROTEIN_ also in the cortical cells . the effect of sulfur availability on _PROTEIN_ of and was determined . the mrna contents of both transporters in arabidopsis were estimated by quantitative real time rt pcr . when plants were grown on sulfur replete medium both and mrnas were relatively abundant in roots compared with shoots . was _PROTEIN_ in roots both under sulfur sufficient and deficient conditions however the mrna contents in shoots increased upon sulfur limitation . mrna was highly inducible by sulfur limitation both in shoots and roots . the response of to sulfur limitation was seen also in the _METHOD_ fusion gene _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . transgenic plants with the gene _METHOD_ fusion constructs were used for the analysis . the accumulation of transporter _METHOD_ fusion protein in the roots and hypocotyls of _METHOD_ plants corresponded with the observed patterns of mrna _PROTEIN_ . _METHOD_ of _METHOD_ was increased approximately threefold to fivefold in the roots of sulfur starved plants compared with the control plants grown with an adequate sulfur supply . three independent transgenic lines with homozygous single t dna insertions showed the same response . the _METHOD_ fusion proteins were accumulated both under s and conditions however the levels were not remarkably modulated by sulfur limitation in the roots as expected from the quantification of mrna contents in the rt pcr analysis . to investigate the function of and transporters in planta knockout mutants were isolated from the pools of arabidopsis t dna insertion lines . mutants were isolated with t dnas integrated in the intron of and exon of respectively . homozygous progenies with single t dna insertions were selected by pcr and dna gel blot hybridization analysis . the and mutants were crossed and the double knockout was selected from the population . rt pcr analysis indicated that and mrnas translatable to functional proteins were not detected in the t dna insertion lines . to confirm the function of transporter _METHOD_ was introduced into the double mutant by crossing . two independent lines and containing triple homozygous insertions of t dna t dna and _METHOD_ were selected by pcr analysis and _METHOD_ imaging as described in methods . no accumulation of the endogenous and transcripts was observed in and plants however _METHOD_ mrna was _PROTEIN_ from the _METHOD_ construct . dna gel blot hybridization indicated that a single copy of _METHOD_ was inserted in and plants . the _METHOD_ mrna in and was _PROTEIN_ approximately threefold higher than the mrna in the wild type presumably because of the position effect of the t dna insertion sites . in addition _METHOD_ was accumulated by sulfur limitation in and plants showing approximately threefold to fourfold and fold to twofold increase in shoots and roots respectively . the response of _METHOD_ mrna in and corresponded to the changes of native mrna in the wild type plants . furthermore the mutants and _METHOD_ plants showed no morphological phenotypes both under sulfur replete and sulfur limited conditions . these plants were used for further experiments . to determine the function of _LOCATION_ transporters intact _LOCATION_ were isolated from the wild type double knockout and _METHOD_ lines and . callus was generated from the hypocotyls of etiolated seedlings and propagated for _LOCATION_ isolation . as shown in figure neutral red staining ensured the integrity of the tonoplast and intactness of the _LOCATION_ isolated from the callus . _METHOD_ of _METHOD_ was observed in the tonoplasts of the _LOCATION_ isolated from and derived callus . measurements of ion contents indicated increased accumulation of sulfate in the _LOCATION_ of the double knockout compared with the wild type . the amount of sulfate was standardized with the calcium content that showed a constant level of accumulation between the wild type and knockout . the sulfate content in the _LOCATION_ was estimated as fold higher in the double knockout than in the wild type . in addition the sulfate content of the _LOCATION_ was significantly _PROTEIN_ by _PROTEIN_ the _METHOD_ construct in the double knockout . it is suggested that the function of is linked to the efflux of sulfate from the _LOCATION_ and that _METHOD_ fusion protein functions to complement the double knockout releasing sulfate from the _LOCATION_ . these results provided functional evidence for the role of _LOCATION_ sulfate transporter facilitating the efflux of sulfate from the _LOCATION_ . the roles of and transporters were determined by feeding sulfate to the roots and measuring distribution in the seedlings . plants were grown under low sulfur conditions to maximize and _PROTEIN_ . the results indicated that the activities of transporters modulate the storage of sulfate in the roots . more sulfate was accumulated in the roots when the function of was absent in the mutant . the function of was confirmed in double knockout plants overexpressing _METHOD_ . the content of radioactive sulfate was significantly _PROTEIN_ in the roots of and as compared with the double knockout . the results indicated that the capacity of _LOCATION_ storage of sulfate _PROTEIN_ significantly in the roots of and plants . this is suggested to be the consequence of abundant _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ in the roots of and that allows rapid release of sulfate from the _LOCATION_ in the root tissues . these lines were even more efficient at releasing sulfate than the wild type . the results of and showed clear genetic complementation of the double mutant by overexpression of _METHOD_ . similarly sulfate was accumulated in the roots of the knockout showing statistically significant differences from the wild type . this was also evident from the comparison between the and knockouts . the increase of from the wild type was relatively smaller in than in . these results suggested that is the _PROTEIN_ transporter facilitating unloading of _LOCATION_ sulfate reserve in the roots and may play similar and supplementary roles supporting the function at the tonoplast . contribution of was estimated of the function . although the function has not been confirmed by reintroduction of in the knockout the results suggested that this second isoform may additionally contribute in controlling the efflux of sulfate from the _LOCATION_ in roots . in contrast with the changes in roots the amount of sulfate transported to shoot was not drastically changed in the knockouts and in the overexpressors . it is suggested that loading of sulfate into the xylem is homeostatically controlled to _PROTEIN_ a constant level translocated to the shoots .
