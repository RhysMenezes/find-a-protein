nucleotides are synthesized from de novo and salvage pathways . to characterize the uridine salvage pathway two genes _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ that tentatively encode uridine kinase and uracil phosphoribosyltransferase bifunctional enzymes were studied in arabidopsis thaliana . t dna insertions in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ reduced transcript _PROTEIN_ and increased plant tolerance to toxic analogs fluorouridine and fluorouracil . enzyme activity assays using purified recombinant proteins indicated that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ have uk but not uprt activity . subcellular localization using a c terminal enhanced yellow _METHOD_ protein fusion indicated that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ localize to _LOCATION_ . the _PROTEIN_ mutant shows reduced transient leaf starch during the day . external application of orotate rescued this phenotype in _PROTEIN_ indicating pyrimidine pools are limiting for starch synthesis in _PROTEIN_ . intermediates for lignin synthesis were upregulated and there was increased lignin and reduced cellulose content in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . levels of _PROTEIN_ adp adp _PROTEIN_ utp udp and udp _PROTEIN_ were altered in a light dependent manner . seed composition of the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants included lower oil and higher protein compared with the wild type . unlike single gene mutants the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant has severe developmental defects and reduced _METHOD_ accumulation indicating these enzymes catalyze redundant reactions . these findings point to crucial roles played by uridine salvage for photoassimilate allocation and partitioning .
in arabidopsis five homologous genes contain both a uprt domain and an n terminal uk domain and are herein referred to as uk _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . unlike _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ have transit peptides at the n terminus . individual knockout lines for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were identified by rt pcr . three individual t dna lines were identified for _PROTEIN_ . transcript _PROTEIN_ is completely abolished in the line and transcript levels are unaffected in the other two lines . two individual t dna insertion lines contain inserts within the _PROTEIN_ gene . the t dna insertion in the line does not affect _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ whereas in the line _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is undetectable . therefore the and lines were renamed _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ respectively . these results are in agreement with previous reports . pyrimidine salvage pathways offer multiple potential targets to incorporate cytotoxic analogs such as fluorouracil _PROTEIN_ and fluorouridine _PROTEIN_ into cellular nucleotide pools . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are converted to fluoro uridine monophosphate by uprt and uk respectively . fluoro uridine monophosphate is further converted to fluoro uridine triphosphate _PROTEIN_ by a two step route . in humans cytotoxicity of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ is varied _PROTEIN_ can be incorporated into rna instead of utp _PROTEIN_ is activated by the formation of fdump an inhibitor of thymidylate synthase that is involved in the synthesis of dna _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ can be incorporated into dna and _PROTEIN_ can be conjugated to sugars and incorporated into _LOCATION_ thus altering _LOCATION_ functions . however the cytotoxic _METHOD_ of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in plants are less studied and it remains unclear if one or more of these _METHOD_ is the mode of action . to determine if sensitivity to _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ is affected in the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants seeds were germinated on half strength murashige and skoog _METHOD_ medium supplemented with _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ at specified concentrations . after d of growth chlorophyll content was measured . the _PROTEIN_ mutant showed resistance to _PROTEIN_ when the concentration was increased to _PROTEIN_ no longer displayed any significant difference in sensitivity compared with the wild type . in contrast the _PROTEIN_ mutant showed higher tolerance to _PROTEIN_ up to . compared with _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants showed a much higher range of tolerance to _PROTEIN_ . even in the presence of _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants showed differences in chlorophyll accumulation from the wild type . overall the _PROTEIN_ mutant showed a higher degree of tolerance to _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ than the _PROTEIN_ mutant . since the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ toxic effects are caused by the remaining total uk and uprt activity respectively in the _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ mutant tolerance to _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ indicates less uk or uprt activity in the gene knockout lines . the observation that _PROTEIN_ is more tolerant to _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ than the _PROTEIN_ mutant suggests that _PROTEIN_ has higher activity than _PROTEIN_ in vivo . to achieve a similar suppression of seedling greening using _PROTEIN_ higher concentrations were needed _PROTEIN_ for both the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants which suggests that _PROTEIN_ is the preferred substrate for the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ proteins . the above mentioned _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ feeding experiments provide only indirect evidence that the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ proteins posses both uk and uprt activity . since there are differences in the uptake and subsequent metabolism of uridine and uracil direct confirmation of uk and uprt activity was necessary . therefore the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ proteins were _PROTEIN_ in escherichia coli and the purified proteins assayed for uk uprt uridine ribohydrolase and ump kinase activity in vitro . the experiments demonstrated that recombinant _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ proteins have uk activity with a vmax of and and a km for uridine of and mm for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ respectively . uprt urh and ump kinase activities were undetectable with both enzymes . to confirm reduced activity in the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants uk and uprt activity was quantified from week old aerial leaves . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants showed and lower uk activity respectively compared with wild type plants . there was no significant difference in uprt activity which supports the recombinant protein results that the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ proteins have uk but not uprt activity . the uridine and uracil content in week old seedlings also was measured . the uridine content in the _PROTEIN_ mutant was higher than the wild type and the _PROTEIN_ mutant showed a small but insignificant increase in uridine content . uracil was undetectable in the wild type plants and in the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants . the lack of uprt activity for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ raises the question why do the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants show increased tolerance toward _PROTEIN_ compared with the wild type ? one possible answer is that nucleoside phosphorylase reversibly converts _PROTEIN_ and rib into _PROTEIN_ although this activity has never been reported in plants . another possible answer is that uridine uracil or other nucleosides or nucleobases accumulate in the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants thus diluting the specific activity of the toxic intermediates . to observe if leaf starch biosynthesis is affected by the _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ mutation whole plants were harvested before a light cycle and then again _PROTEIN_ in the light cycle . at the beginning of a light cycle we observed little leaf starch and no differences among the wild type _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ plants which indicates that leaf starch degradation during the dark period is not affected . however _PROTEIN_ in the light cycle the _PROTEIN_ mutant had accumulated less leaf starch than the wild type on a fresh weight basis . the _PROTEIN_ mutant also accumulated less leaf starch compared with wild type plants but the reduction was statistically insignificant . to observe if the _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ gene mutations affect starch levels in seeds developing seeds were harvested at and d after fertilization _PROTEIN_ and their starch content quantified . at _PROTEIN_ seeds from _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutant plants accumulated and less starch respectively than the wild type plants . starch content sharply _PROTEIN_ thereafter and starch content reached its lowest level at _PROTEIN_ at which point no differences were observed between wild type and mutant plants . these results indicate that seed starch accumulation is reduced in the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants but that starch degradation is largely unaffected . orotic acid and uridine are substrates for de novo and salvage pathways of uridine nucleotide synthesis respectively . externally supplied oa leads to a specific increase in uridine nucleotide levels and a stimulation of suc degradation and starch synthesis in discs from growing potato tubers . to investigate if exogenously applied uridine or oa affects leaf starch accumulation in planta wild type and _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutant plants were sprayed at am daily with mm uridine or mm oa for a period of month . leaves from the plants were subsequently harvested in _PROTEIN_ afternoon and starch quantified . application of uridine did not significantly affect leaf starch content in the wild type plants or in the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutant plants . application of oa on the other hand did increase leaf starch content by in the _PROTEIN_ mutant plants compared with a water treated _PROTEIN_ control but had no affect on the leaf starch content in wild type and _PROTEIN_ mutant plants . to better understand why starch content is reduced in the _PROTEIN_ mutant and its relationship with nucleotide metabolism metabolites were comparatively profiled . metabolic profiling of the wild type and the _PROTEIN_ mutant identified compounds of which are unknown . ten amino acids were detected . compared with the wild type the _PROTEIN_ mutant had higher levels of l asp l glu l phe and gly . n acetyl glu content was about half in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . partial list of the metabolites identified from wild type and _PROTEIN_ mutant plants of the organic acids detected intermediates of the tricarboxylic acid cycle were the most substantially different in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . malate and fumarate levels in the _PROTEIN_ mutant were significantly higher and respectively compared with the wild type . citrate was higher in the _PROTEIN_ mutant than in the wild type although this elevated level was not statistically significant . levels of succinate were the same in the wild type as in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . interestingly maleic acid was elevated fold in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . maleic acid can be converted into fumarate by maleate cis trans isomerase and converted into malate by hydration catalyzed by malate hydrolase . two tca cycle intermediates oxaloacetate and ketoglutarate can be used for asp and glu biosynthesis respectively and pool levels of these two amino acids also were elevated in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . the similar levels of succinate in the _PROTEIN_ mutant and the wild type may suggest that only a partial tca cycle is operating during the light period . benzoic acid a product of phenol serial oxidation through benzaldehyde was fold higher in the _PROTEIN_ mutant compared with the wild type accordingly phenol also was elevated by fold in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . approximately sugars and sugar alcohols were detected . there were no differences in levels of two major transportable _METHOD_ of sugars suc and trehalose between the wild type and the _PROTEIN_ mutant . however glc fru and man were and higher respectively in the _PROTEIN_ mutant compared with the wild type . the _PROTEIN_ mutant compared with the wild type also had elevated levels of psicose a c epimer of d fructose melezitose a nonreducing trisaccharide sugar and galactinol . the enhanced concentration of monosaccharides in the _PROTEIN_ mutant supports the observation of reduced leaf and seed starch due to reduced biosynthesis . trans sinapinic acid and coumarine are used for lignin and lignan biosynthesis in planta . trans sinapinic acid and coumarine two derivatives of l phe were and higher respectively in the _PROTEIN_ mutant compared with the wild type which is in accordance with the enhanced pool size of l phe in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . phe concentration has been demonstrated to profoundly affect flux through the phenylpropanoid pathway phe feeding to pinus taeda suspension cells increased p coumaryl and coniferyl alcohol synthesis and phe ammonia lyase coumarate coa ligase caffeoyl coa o methyltransferase and cinnamoyl coa reductase transcript levels . dihydroxybutanoic acid _LOCATION_ acid and threnoic acid which are the products of lignin oxidation were and higher respectively in the _PROTEIN_ mutant compared with the wild type . dehydroascorbic acid a reducing form of ascorbic acid was elevated more than threefold in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . dehydroascorbic acid can be converted into ascorbic acid and hydrogen peroxide by peroxidase . the rising concentration of dehydroascorbic suggests that hydrogen peroxide production is also elevated in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . hydrogen peroxide is required for monolignol oxidation and dehydrogenative polymerization . the collective data suggest that lignin and lignan biosynthesis or polymerization is enhanced in _PROTEIN_ mutant . to test this lignin and cellulose staining were performed . the staining results indicated that lignin content was higher and cellulose content was lower in the _PROTEIN_ mutant compared with the wild type . lignin and cellulose content in the _PROTEIN_ mutant was not different from the wild type . glu and asp two precursors for de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis were and higher respectively in the _PROTEIN_ mutant compared with the wild type . enhanced levels of these metabolites in the _PROTEIN_ mutant raised the possibility that de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis was affected in _PROTEIN_ mutant . to test this possibility rt pcr was conducted to observe the transcript levels of the genes involved in this pathway . the results indicate that three genes were upregulated during the day period in both mutants compared with the wild type . these are a _PROTEIN_ synthase which catalyzes the first step for de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis an asp transcarbamoylase which catalyzes the first committed step of de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis and a phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate synthase which converts ribose phosphate into prpp for de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis . since rt pcr indicated that de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis pathway is affected in the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants during the light period nucleotide levels were quantified by hplc to further study this observation . in dark _PROTEIN_ leaves _PROTEIN_ content in the _PROTEIN_ mutant plant was to lower than in the wild type and _PROTEIN_ mutant plants . this difference dissipated within h after illumination when _PROTEIN_ was mostly consumed but reappeared to h after illumination . for adp both the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutant plants contained less adp than the wild type from to h after illumination and this difference was mitigated by h of light cycle as well as dark _PROTEIN_ . adp _PROTEIN_ content in the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutant plants was and lower respectively at h after light cycle compared with the wild type there was no difference at other time points . utp showed a much different accumulation trend compared with _PROTEIN_ . utp levels were low in dark _PROTEIN_ leaves and increased only slightly for the first h after illumination then increased rapidly between and h of illumination . during the first h of illumination there was no difference in utp content among wild type _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutant plants . after to h of light cycle the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutant plants had significantly lower utp content than wild type plants . in dark _PROTEIN_ leaves udp content was higher in the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutant plants compared with wild type plants h after illumination no significant difference in udp content was observed between wild type and the ukl mutant plants . at and h after illumination the _PROTEIN_ mutant plant had lower udp levels than both the _PROTEIN_ mutant and wild type plants . udp _PROTEIN_ content was and higher in the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutant than wild type plants at h after illumination and lower in the _PROTEIN_ mutant than the wild type at h after illumination . no significant differences were observed between wild type and _PROTEIN_ mutant plants at any time for udp _PROTEIN_ . amp and ump content could not be accurately quantified due to their coelution with unknown compounds . the ratios of _PROTEIN_ to adp and utp to udp also were calculated . before illumination the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutant plants showed a lower ratio of _PROTEIN_ to adp compared with the wild type this difference disappeared during the light period . by contrast the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutant plants displayed a lower ratio of utp to udp h after illumination . siliques from plants at _PROTEIN_ were harvested h after illumination for nucleotide quantification . the results indicate that the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutant plants have significantly lower utp udp udp _PROTEIN_ and adp _PROTEIN_ content compared with the wild type . this agrees with the low seed starch phenotype for the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutant plants . external application of orotate to the _PROTEIN_ mutant plants largely rescued the low leaf starch phenotype . to understand if the changes in leaf starch content accompany a nucleotide level change the aerial leaves from week old plants were harvested for nucleotide measurement after weeks of oa application . oa application restored nucleotide levels in _PROTEIN_ mutant plants . the lack of any visible growth defects in the _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ mutant plants could have two explanations uridine salvage has a minor role in planta or the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ genes are redundant . to test the second possibility _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant plants were produced and analyzed . when germinated on _METHOD_ media for d the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ single mutant plants developed green cotyledons similar to the wild type . in contrast the double mutant plants grew much more slowly than both the wild type and the single mutant plants . additionally the cotyledon was pale green . about of the double mutant plants died at this seedling stage . after being transferred to soil the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant plants initiated true leaf growth although at a slower rate compared with the wild type and _PROTEIN_ of whether they were grown under continuous light or long day conditions . the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant plants showed variable severity in growth retardation and senesced at different developmental stages in most plants the apical meristem and the young leaf began to senesce first followed by the older leaf . this observation agrees with the gene _PROTEIN_ data showing that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are highly _PROTEIN_ in the shoot apex inflorescence . no _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant plants reached reproductive maturity . these observations imply that uridine salvage plays an essential role for meristem _PROTEIN_ young leaf growth and phase transition from vegetative growth to reproduction . quantitation of _METHOD_ from plants grown under long day conditions showed no difference between wild type plants and the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutant plants however the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant plants accumulated only of the _METHOD_ of wild type plants . thus we conclude that the lack of visible growth defects in the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutant plants is due to gene redundancy . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are actively _PROTEIN_ during seed development although with different trends . the _PROTEIN_ transcript is highly _PROTEIN_ between developmental stages and while the _PROTEIN_ transcript shows only a gradual increase at these developmental stages . this _PROTEIN_ pattern suggests that uridine salvage plays an important role during seed filling . to explore this possibility physical and composition traits of the seed were measured in the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutant plants . no significant differences were observed with respect to total silique and total seed _METHOD_ per plant but individual seed _METHOD_ from the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutant plants was and greater respectively than wild type seed . the lipid content of the seeds from the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutant plants was and lower respectively compared with the wild type . seed protein content was and higher in the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ seeds respectively . no significant differences were recorded in seed starch suc glc and fru content between wild type and mutant seeds except that seeds from the _PROTEIN_ mutant plant had and higher starch and suc content respectively than the wild type . the seed compositions of the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutant plants showed small but statistically significant changes in lipid and protein compared with seeds from wild type plants likely due to the functional redundancy of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in developing seed . seed trait and composition analysis of the wild type and _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants we reasoned that the double mutants of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ would show much more significant seed composition changes however since the double mutant senesces before bolting we were unable to test this hypothesis . undoubtedly seed composition is affected by reduced photoassimilate supply from the leaf resulting in lower starch during development . reduced starch during early seed development would likely contribute to the reduced oil phenotype . additionally the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutant plants contained lower nucleotide pools which may contribute to the reduced oil content since de novo fatty acid synthesis requires _PROTEIN_ for _PROTEIN_ of acetyl coa the first step in this pathway . because only one t dna knockout line was identified for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ through the currently available t dna line collections it was necessary to correlate genotype with phenotype by complementation . transgenic lines were constructed by _PROTEIN_ the coding sequence of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ cdna with an enhanced yellow _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ fusion at their c termini in the homozygous mutant background . because there are no visible growth defects for the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutant plants we used the low seed starch phenotype of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ to confirm their complementation . siliques from plants at _PROTEIN_ of two individual transgenic lines as well as the wild type and _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ homozygous mutants were harvested and then their starch content quantified . the results demonstrate that _PROTEIN_ of a wild type copy of either _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ can rescue the low seed starch phenotype indicating that the _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ mutation is responsible for this phenotype . to further confirm the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in the transgenic lines rt pcr was conducted . the results confirmed the overexpression of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in the two individual transgenic lines under their respective mutant background . the subcellular localizations of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ remain controversial as subcellular prediction _METHOD_ give different results . loctree multiloc and targetp predict that the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ proteins localize to _LOCATION_ . subloc and _METHOD_ predict that the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ proteins localize to the _LOCATION_ . a previous green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ fusion study of _PROTEIN_ conducted by citation indicated that _PROTEIN_ was cytoplasmic . however the authors did not indicate which binary vector was used failed to show _METHOD_ localization for the empty vector control and did not clarify if the construct could functionally complement the phenotype in a stable manner . therefore it was necessary to reevaluate this result . to observe the protein subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ proteins the transgenic lines were first screened for the _METHOD_ signal by _METHOD_ using a stereomicroscope equipped with an _METHOD_ filter . seeds from _METHOD_ positive lines were germinated on _METHOD_ plates and leaves were harvested to prepare protoplasts for _METHOD_ observation . the results demonstrated that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ localize to _LOCATION_ based upon colocalization with chlorophyll _METHOD_ .
