patterning of stomata valves on the plant epidermis requires the orchestrated actions of signaling components and cell fate determinants . to understand the regulation of stomatal patterning we performed a genetic screen using a background that partially lacks stomatal signaling receptors . here we report the isolation and characterization of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ which confers excessive proliferation of stomatal lineage cells mediated by speechless _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ breaks redundancy among three _LOCATION_ family genes and strongly enhances stomatal patterning defects caused by loss of function in too _PROTEIN_ mouths . _PROTEIN_ seedlings also exhibit incomplete cytokinesis and growth defects including disruptions in root tissue patterning and root hair cell morphogenesis . _PROTEIN_ encodes a putative callose synthase _PROTEIN_ synthase like _PROTEIN_ that is required for callose deposition at the cell plate cell wall and plasmodesmata . consistently symplastic macromolecular diffusion between epidermal cells is significantly increased in _PROTEIN_ and proteins that do not normally move cell to cell including a _METHOD_ protein tagged _PROTEIN_ diffuse to neighboring cells . such a phenotype is not a general trait caused by cytokinesis defects . our findings suggest that the restriction of symplastic movement might be an essential step for the proper segregation of cell fate determinants during stomatal development .
we conducted a genetic screen using a sensitized _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ background in which two of the three _LOCATION_ family genes are absent . _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ plants develop an epidermis with an elevated stomatal density but are otherwise normal . on rare occasions paired stomata were observed both in wild type and _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ cotyledons _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . neither genotype developed stomatal clusters with three or more adjacent stomata _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . by contrast _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ triple loss of function mutants develop excessive numbers of clustered stomata . we reasoned that in the absence of two of the three receptors plants would be more sensitive to the loss of any additional regulators of stomatal patterning . we isolated a line . in the mutant leaves multiple stomata are often formed in a compact aggregate with stomatal pairs trios quartets and adjacent stomata . in addition aggregates of small epidermal cells many resembling meristemoids are formed in sectors across the epidermis . segregation analysis showed that the mutation is recessive and monogenic . the mutant was named _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ owing to its aggregated stomatal phenotype . we introduced _PROTEIN_ into the wild type background to test whether the observed phenotype requires _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . the epidermal phenotype of _PROTEIN_ leaves in the wild type background was much milder than that of _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . numbers of stomatal pairs trios and quartets were diminished . no stomatal clusters larger than quartets were found in _PROTEIN_ . similarly fewer small epidermal cells were observed . thus _PROTEIN_ phenotypes are enhanced by the loss of function in _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ . _PROTEIN_ seedlings showed pleiotropic phenotypes including severe dwarfism short roots with disrupted cell files short and branched root hairs and seedling lethality . furthermore incomplete cytokinesis was frequently observed in _PROTEIN_ . these findings suggest that _PROTEIN_ is required for proper cell division and tissue patterning throughout plant organs including stomatal patterning . the _PROTEIN_ leaf epidermis exhibited incomplete cytokinesis and excessive epidermal cell proliferation . we hypothesized that the latter defect is due to excessive entry into the stomatal lineage . to test this we examined the _PROTEIN_ patterns of stomatal lineage markers in _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ marks early stomatal lineage cells including mmcs meristemoids and slgcs . clusters of small highly divided epidermal cells in _PROTEIN_ seedlings exhibited high reporter activity of protmm gus _METHOD_ suggesting that the _PROTEIN_ mutation causes a vast increase in stomatal lineage divisions in a disorganized manner . _PROTEIN_ is specifically _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ meristemoids that are differentiating into gmc . occasionally multiple adjacent cells showed high _PROTEIN_ promoter activity which is likely to predict the eventual formation of stomatal clusters . the excessive formation of small stomatal lineage cells is a hallmark of _PROTEIN_ overexpression . we therefore tested whether _PROTEIN_ is ectopically _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ and whether _PROTEIN_ is required for the _PROTEIN_ epidermal phenotype . _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ in early stomatal lineage cells and the _PROTEIN_ mutant was devoid of stomatal cell lineages . numerous _PROTEIN_ positive cells were observed in the young cotyledon epidermis of _PROTEIN_ . introduction of _PROTEIN_ into _PROTEIN_ eliminated all small stomatal lineage cells . by contrast incomplete cytokinesis of pavement cells still occurred in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant . these findings point to two independent roles of _PROTEIN_ in regulating leaf epidermal development _PROTEIN_ mediated initiation and division of stomatal cell lineage and _PROTEIN_ independent cytokinesis . in support of this idea the root epidermis of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ exhibited disrupted cell files with incomplete cytokinesis . the stomatal clustering phenotype of _PROTEIN_ in the wild type background remained relatively mild . therefore the _PROTEIN_ family signaling pathway might still be able to largely enforce stomatal spacing in _PROTEIN_ . to test this we investigated the genetic interactions of _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ and _LOCATION_ family genes . quantitative analysis of stomatal cluster size was performed for key genotypes . in tmm adjacent stomata are formed . the tmm _PROTEIN_ double mutant developed _METHOD_ clusters of stomata far more severe than those in either the tmm or the _PROTEIN_ single mutant . similarly the _PROTEIN_ mutation intensified the stomatal cluster phenotype of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ triple mutant . we sought to understand whether _PROTEIN_ acts in an independent pathway from or an overlapping pathway with the _PROTEIN_ family . for this purpose we genetically dissected the contribution of each _LOCATION_ family member . the three _LOCATION_ family genes exhibit unequal redundancy and a stomatal cluster phenotype is manifested only when the entire family is lost . _LOCATION_ single mutants occasionally produce slgcs that do not accompany differentiated stomata . the _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ epidermis formed severely divided patches of small cells but otherwise appeared similar to that of _PROTEIN_ thereby suggesting additive effects . in contrast to _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ and _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ triple mutants exhibited severe stomatal clustering phenotypes . we further tested whether such synergistic effects can be observed even when only a single copy of _LOCATION_ is eliminated . indeed _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ also showed a strong stomatal clustering phenotype . we conclude that _PROTEIN_ intensifies stomatal cell cell signaling defects and breaks down the functional redundancies among _LOCATION_ family genes with sensitivity to the dosage of _LOCATION_ . to understand the molecular nature of _PROTEIN_ we performed map based cloning . our fine mapping delineated the _PROTEIN_ locus within a kb interval on chromosome . sequencing the interval led to the identification of a single g to a substitution at position of _GENE_ which encodes a putative callose synthase _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . because the original _PROTEIN_ mapping population contained a mixed genome of col/ws and ler wild type _PROTEIN_ alleles from ws and ler were also sequenced . both alleles possess g at this position confirming that _PROTEIN_ is not a naturally occurring polymorphism . sequence analysis of the wild type _PROTEIN_ transcripts revealed mis annotation of _PROTEIN_ in the existing database . based on the experimental data _PROTEIN_ is a large gene consisting of exons with a coding region of bp . in _PROTEIN_ the g to a substitution disrupted the splice acceptor site at intron which resulted in three major splicing variants . variant adopted the _PROTEIN_ at created by the _PROTEIN_ g to a substitution and was one base pair shorter than the _PROTEIN_ mrna . variants and were and bp longer than the _PROTEIN_ mrna respectively . variant was produced by a cryptic splice acceptor site at bp from the correct splicing acceptor site whereas variant was unspliced . all splicing variants caused frameshifts each of which truncated the coding sequence starting from exon and added instead a short stretch of and out of frame amino acids respectively . _PROTEIN_ encodes a large integral _LOCATION_ protein of amino acids with sixteen predicted transmembrane helices . the three splicing variants all result in truncation at the sixth extracytoplasmic hydrophilic loop and removal of five c terminal transmembrane helices . to confirm that _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ we characterized the phenotype of the available _PROTEIN_ t dna insertion allele _PROTEIN_ . it was originally reported that _PROTEIN_ confers male gametophytic lethality . however data obtained by us and recently reported by other groups _PROTEIN_ show that _PROTEIN_ mutations result in seedling lethality with severe dwarfism . cotyledons and leaves of _PROTEIN_ plants exhibited similar stomatal patterning defects to those in _PROTEIN_ indicating that the _PROTEIN_ phenotypes are due to loss of function in _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ that the degree of stomatal clustering was less severe in _PROTEIN_ than in _PROTEIN_ suggests that _PROTEIN_ might represent a partial loss of function allele . _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ broadly throughout plant organs/tissues based on the available _PROTEIN_ data . callose a linear _PROTEIN_ polymer accumulates in various tissues/cells/organelles during normal development . the incomplete cytokinesis observed in _PROTEIN_ pavement cells is consistent with the recent finding that _PROTEIN_ acts as a cell plate callose synthase _PROTEIN_ . in addition to its role in the cell plate callose deposition imposes physical constraints to the symplastic channel . to address the role of _PROTEIN_ during stomatal development we examined callose deposition in wild type and _PROTEIN_ seedlings using a callose specific dye aniline blue fluorochrome . in the wild type rosette leaf epidermis bright linear signals marked cell plates in dividing cells . in addition strong punctate _METHOD_ signals were detected on the walls of epidermal cells most notably in pavement cells and slgcs which is characteristic of plasmodesmatal callose deposition . consistently these punctate signals co localized with the plasmodesmatal marker _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . in contrast to the wild type almost no aniline blue signals were detected in the _PROTEIN_ leaf epidermis . we also noted the absence of callose deposition in _PROTEIN_ root hairs and abnormal root hair morphology . on the basis of these findings we conclude that _PROTEIN_ is required for the proper accumulation of callose at cell plates cell walls and plasmodesmata . because _PROTEIN_ is required for both cell plate and plasmodesmatal callose deposition we postulated that the overproliferation of stomatal lineage cells might be due to the reduction in plasmodesmatal callose deposition . as a first step towards gaining mechanistic insight we investigated whether symplastic cell to cell connections are altered in the _PROTEIN_ epidermis . monomeric soluble _METHOD_ was used as a reporter to monitor passive diffusion from cell to cell . specifically _METHOD_ was bombarded to the leaf epidermis and diffusion of _METHOD_ signals from the point of initial _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was assayed . a similar method has been recently used to assess cell to cell trafficking . in nearly all cases in wild type a single cell at the site of transformation showed a bright _METHOD_ signal . a few surrounding cells showed a dim _METHOD_ signal indicating diffusion . _PROTEIN_ epidermal cells without obvious cytokinesis defects were examined in diffusion assays . an average of four to five adjacent cells in the _PROTEIN_ epidermis showed strong _METHOD_ _METHOD_ with many more surrounding cells showing dim _METHOD_ signals . total numbers of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ cells per site in the _PROTEIN_ epidermis were significantly higher than those in the wild type epidermis . to address whether the size exclusion limit _PROTEIN_ was increased in _PROTEIN_ we simultaneously introduced trimeric _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and control _METHOD_ via co bombardment and monitored their diffusion . in wild type all cells _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were solitary . thus unlike with _METHOD_ there was no diffusion of _METHOD_ indicating that _METHOD_ is beyond the _PROTEIN_ in the wild type epidermis . by contrast in the _PROTEIN_ epidermis a cluster of epidermal cells _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . in some cases a cell adjacent to the site of transformation exhibited a dim _METHOD_ signal indicating that _METHOD_ was able to spread into neighboring cells in the _PROTEIN_ epidermis . these results suggest that the reduced plasmodesmatal callose deposition caused by the _PROTEIN_ mutation is associated with an increase in symplastic connectivity between leaf epidermal cells . in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mediated stomatal cell lineage divisions become excessive and dysregulated . to explore the mechanistic link between increased cell to cell connections and stomatal patterning we tested the diffusion of functional _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in wild type and _PROTEIN_ epidermis . for this purpose _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and control _METHOD_ constructs were co bombarded . in wild type _METHOD_ signal was detected solely in the _LOCATION_ of a single cell at the site of transformation indicating that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ does not diffuse from cell to cell . by contrast in _PROTEIN_ epidermis multiple adjacent cells _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . in some cases neighboring cells exhibited a dim _METHOD_ signal in the _LOCATION_ . the presence of a continuous cell periphery indicates that these _METHOD_ positive _LOCATION_ are not likely from a single multinucleate cell . the results demonstrate that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ diffuses from cell to cell in the _PROTEIN_ epidermis and suggests that the failure to properly contain cell fate determinants in _PROTEIN_ causes the stomatal patterning defects . because _PROTEIN_ is required for cytokinesis incomplete cell division within the epidermis might also contribute to the dysregulated partitioning of regulatory macromolecules . to clarify this we examined the epidermal phenotype and cell to cell connectivity in two well described cytokinesis mutants _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . like _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ seedlings exhibit dwarfism but produce rosette leaves and survive for weeks after germination . consistent with the previous descriptions in tobacco leaves cotyledon and rosette leaf epidermis of _PROTEIN_ showed occasional incomplete cytokinesis of pavement cells and gmcs the latter of which resulted in abnormal stomata with incomplete separation of the guard cells . as reported previously incomplete cytokinesis and reduced lobing of pavement cells are also observed in the _PROTEIN_ epidermis . _PROTEIN_ gmcs failed to divide and expand . in spite of these defects neither _PROTEIN_ nor _PROTEIN_ epidermis showed excessive production of stomatal lineage cells or severe stomatal clusters indicating that stomatal patterning phenotypes in _PROTEIN_ are not simply due to defective cytokinesis . next we investigated cell to cell diffusion of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and soluble _METHOD_ in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ leaf epidermis and compared the results with wild type and _PROTEIN_ . among the four genotypes only _PROTEIN_ exhibited a significant difference in _METHOD_ diffusion _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . as in wild type _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was detected solely in the _LOCATION_ of a single cell at the site of transformation in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . the results are inconsistent with the hypothesis that leakiness of cells is a common consequence of incomplete cytokinesis .
arabidopsis thaliana columbia accession was used as a wild type . mutants and lines used in this study were in the col background unless otherwise specified . the _PROTEIN_ mutant was derived from an _METHOD_ mutagenized _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ population and was outcrossed three times to wild type before analysis . the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ background possesses an additional mutation which confers trichomeless leaves . a t dna insertion allele of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was obtained from the nottingham arabidopsis stock centre . the following transgenic lines and mutants have been described previously gus protmm gus _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ tmm and protmm gus _METHOD_ promute _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . the transgenes and known mutant alleles were introduced into _PROTEIN_ via genetic crosses . seedlings were grown in modified murashige skoog media with vitamins and w/v sucrose at under long day conditions . plates _PROTEIN_ were sealed with surgical tape to minimize condensation . _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ seeds were treated with _METHOD_ overnight . seeds were harvested from individual plants and seed populations were visually screened for seedling epidermal phenotypes . mutant genotypes were verified by pcr based analyses . the _PROTEIN_ mutant allele was detected by derived cleavage amplified polymorphic sequence using the primer pair _PROTEIN_ dcaps f nlaiv and _PROTEIN_ dcaps r nlaiv and subsequent digestion with nlaiv . the t dna insertion site of _PROTEIN_ was detected by the primer pair _GENE_ and gabi k . see table in the supplementary material for primer sequences . genotyping of _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ tmm and _PROTEIN_ has been described previously . a mapping population of _PROTEIN_ was generated by crossing _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ to ler . initially a bulked segregant analysis was performed using a combined pool of _PROTEIN_ seedlings from the mapping population which revealed the strong linkage of _PROTEIN_ to the mid bottom of chromosome at sslp markers _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ . further fine mapping was performed within this interval using two sslp markers and a total of _PROTEIN_ seedlings which located _PROTEIN_ within the kb interval encompassing the bacs and . all predicted open reading frames within this interval were sequenced and this led to the identification of a single substitution at position of _GENE_ which encodes _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . the sslp caps and dcaps markers for map based cloning of _PROTEIN_ were designed based on the information available in monsanto arabidopsis polymorphism and ler sequence collection . for primer sequences and amplified fragment sizes in col and ler see table in the supplementary material . for the list of sequencing primers see table in the supplementary material . total rna was isolated from day old wild type and _PROTEIN_ seedlings . cdna synthesis and reverse transcription pcr were performed as described previously using the following primer pairs . for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ cdna f and _PROTEIN_ cdna r for actin control act and act _PROTEIN_ for sequencing rt pcr products _PROTEIN_ cdna seq f _PROTEIN_ . differential interference contrast microscopy was performed according to bemis and torii . for confocal microscopy seedlings were treated with either propidium iodide _PROTEIN_ or . _METHOD_ of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ were simultaneously captured using a zeiss _PROTEIN_ meta or a zeiss _PROTEIN_ with a objective lens . for histochemical callose staining seedlings were infiltrated with mg/ml aniline blue fluorochrome in silwett for minutes and prior to mounting wild type and _PROTEIN_ were counterstained briefly with to highlight the cell periphery . the abaxial side of rosette leaves was observed with a zeiss _PROTEIN_ . aniline blue stained root hairs were observed with an olympus _METHOD_ microscope with a uv/b filter . twelve day old seedlings of wild type _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ were subjected to dic microscopy . four non overlapping frames of cotyledons excluding the mid vein region and numbers of stomata and their cluster size were quantified using imagej . arabidopsis day old seedling rosette leaves were transiently transformed as previously described . briefly microcarriers were prepared with ng of plasmid containing _METHOD_ a combination of _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ or a combination of _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . these plasmids were coated on gold particles and bombarded using the _PROTEIN_ particle delivery system . specimens were observed under a zeiss lsm meta or an _PROTEIN_ confocal microscope . _METHOD_ _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was monitored hours after the bombardment . the genbank accession number for the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mrna sequence is .
