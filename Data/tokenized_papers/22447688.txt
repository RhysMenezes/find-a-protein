_PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ ubiquitin ligases _PROTEIN_ were recently shown to exert their specificity through the binding of various substrate receptors which bind the _PROTEIN_ interactor dna damaged binding through a wdxr motif . in a segregation based mutagenesis screen we identified a wdxr motif containing protein _PROTEIN_ required for male and female gametogenesis and seed development . we demonstrate that _PROTEIN_ physically interacts with arabidopsis thaliana _PROTEIN_ in planta suggesting that _PROTEIN_ may be a novel substrate recruiter of _PROTEIN_ complexes . examination of mutants revealed a failure in the fusion of the _PROTEIN_ cells in embryo sac development in addition to embryo and endosperm developmental arrest at various stages ranging from the zygote stage to the globular stage . _PROTEIN_ embryos suggest a defect in the transition to bilateral symmetry in the apical embryo domain further supported by aberrant apical embryo localization of _PROTEIN_ a direct target of the auxin response _PROTEIN_ protein monopteros . moreover the auxin response pattern as determined using the synthetic auxin responsive reporter _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein was shifted in the basal embryo and suspensor but does not support a strong direct link to auxin response . interestingly the observed embryo and endosperm phenotype is reminiscent of _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ loss of function and thus may support a regulatory role of a putative _PROTEIN_ ligase complex .
a screen based on the distorted segregation of a transposon borne nptii marker conferring resistance to kanamycin was used to identify mutants affected in male and female gametophyte development . the mutant line showed reduced transmission through the male and female gametophyte and during self fertilization and was thus selected for further studies . using a vectorette pcr the and ends of the dsg transposon were found to reside in the second exon of the gene _GENE_ . this gene encodes a repeat protein and we termed it _PROTEIN_ due to its high similarity to the wd repeat protein family _PROTEIN_ . the mutant line was accordingly named _PROTEIN_ . the insertion leads to a truncated protein with two predicted stop codons immediately after the insertion site . two splice variants _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were verified by cloning and sequencing and the dsg element insertion site in _PROTEIN_ corresponds to the n terminal sequence of the longer splice variant _PROTEIN_ whereas the coding sequence of the shorter splice form _PROTEIN_ is unaffected by _PROTEIN_ insertion . transmission of the mutant alleles _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ we further analyzed putative alleles of _PROTEIN_ from the sequence indexed salk t dna insertion database . in the t dna line both t dna borders were found to reside in exon in _PROTEIN_ corresponding to exon in _PROTEIN_ . we named this allele _PROTEIN_ . a stop codon is formed in the t dna two amino acids downstream of the insertion site of the left border sequence of the t dna . for both splice variants this predicts a truncated protein missing the last amino acids . _PROTEIN_ encodes a repeat protein . the best characterized protein in this family and the first to have its structure elucidated is the subunit of the heterotrimeric g proteins . the subunit adopts a propeller fold which is a symmetrical structure made up of repeats each consisting of a small four stranded antiparallel sheet . each propeller blade contains the first three strands of one repeat and the last strand in the next . the wd repeat containing domains and their implied propeller structure are predicted to act as coordinators for reversible multidomain complex assemblies by supplying a rigid platform or scaffold where a surface for various protein protein interactions has evolved . _PROTEIN_ has five repeats predicted by smart . we further compared _PROTEIN_ to the determined structure of the protein _PROTEIN_ which was chosen due to its sequence similarity to _PROTEIN_ using pymol to check for the presence of other wd repeats than the ones predicted by smart . the similarities between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were restricted to the repeats which determine the propeller blades of _PROTEIN_ indicating the importance of conservation of these sequence domains for the three dimensional structure . we could identify seven possible blades and although blades one and seven were not complete in _METHOD_ of number of sheets a direct alignment of the wd repeats is indicative of a seven repeat wdr structure . a common feature among wdr proteins is that they have a proposed propeller structure and no enzymatic activity . some wdr proteins have additional known functional domains such as the dwd box . _PROTEIN_ contains a submotif of the dwd box named the wdxr motif . both the dwd box and the wdxr motif are signatures for potential substrate receptors of the _PROTEIN_ ubiquitin ligases referred to as putative dcafs _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . wdxr facilitates assembly with and _PROTEIN_ proteins whereas other parts of dcaf bind to proteins to be targeted for ubiquitination . finally _PROTEIN_ contains a signature _PROTEIN_ domain encompassing all seven predicted wd repeats . _PROTEIN_ is unique in arabidopsis but is conserved throughout eukaryotes with highest sequence similarity to plant orthologs . the closest metazoan homolog is found in nematostella vectensis _PROTEIN_ . outside the regions of the protein occupied by the wd propellers no functional domains or repeat structures could be identified . this fits well with the predictions from disopred that a structured region occurs in the n terminal part of the protein whereas the c terminal regions of both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are unstructured . disordered protein regions have no stable structures without their partner molecules and due to this flexibility they may be more _PROTEIN_ for interaction with multiple partners with high specificity but low affinity . various public _PROTEIN_ databases report that _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ throughout the arabidopsis life cycle and also in most tissues _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . to confirm these findings and investigate the abundance of the two splice variants we performed real time quantitative pcr with primers specific for the two splice variants . both splice variants were present in all tissues examined with highest abundance in roots . similarly both splice _METHOD_ could be detected throughout seed development . using a _PROTEIN_ promoter _PROTEIN_ fusion construct _PROTEIN_ in most tissues could be verified using three independent single locus transgenic lines . a thorough analysis of male and female gametophyte stages revealed prominent gus _PROTEIN_ throughout embryo sac development and _PROTEIN_ could also be found in the embryo proper until d after pollination . only low levels of gus _PROTEIN_ in the seed could be detected at _PROTEIN_ developmental stages but a prominent gus signal accumulated in the cotyledons of the mature embryo and persisted in the cotyledons and roots after germination and subsequently in leaves buds and flowers . similarly gus _PROTEIN_ was detected during pollen development from meiosis up to the second pollen mitosis . at mature stages there was no evident gus signal . next we performed a thorough analysis of _PROTEIN_ on the genetic and morphological level . adult heterozygous _PROTEIN_ plants were indistinguishable from the wild type . transmission of the _PROTEIN_ allele was analyzed in successive generations to and showed a stable segregation of during self fertilization . no lines homozygous for the transposon containing nptii were detected among more than sublines analyzed and no homozygous plants were identified by genotyping using the dsg transposon and gene specific primers . to determine which sex of the gametophyte generation was affected in _PROTEIN_ reciprocal crosses were performed . the transmission of the _PROTEIN_ allele was reduced through the male gametophyte and to a lesser extent through the female gametophyte thus suggesting that the _PROTEIN_ mutation impairs male and female development or function . the _PROTEIN_ allele segregated _PROTEIN_ resistant progeny in selfed plants suggesting similar effects as observed in _PROTEIN_ . however only a slight reduction in male and female transmission of the _PROTEIN_ allele could be observed in the progeny of reciprocal crosses . to determine whether the gametophyte effect in _PROTEIN_ was ecotype specific _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ we introgressed _PROTEIN_ into col . col introgressed _PROTEIN_ displayed even more reduced transmission through the male gametophyte but segregation through the female gametophyte was slightly increased . in _PROTEIN_ a weak effect on embryo sac development was expected based on transmission data . close inspection of unfertilized siliques d after emasculation revealed a modest frequency of unfused _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ in _PROTEIN_ embryo sacs compared with wild type ler . the frequency of unfused _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ at dae suggesting a delay in _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ migration and karyogamy . upon hand pollination of female _PROTEIN_ dae the frequency of unfused _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ at dap _PROTEIN_ further compared with ler controls . finally no unfused _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ were found in dae pollinated siliques at dap suggesting that the fusion of _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ to form the diploid central cell _LOCATION_ is delayed in the _PROTEIN_ mutant in the ler background . a similar delay was not observed in the col introgressed _PROTEIN_ allele or in the _PROTEIN_ allele suggesting that ecotype specific modifiers influence the penetrance of the _PROTEIN_ phenotype . this supports the observation that all crosses involving a maternal ler partner showed a slight delay in _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ fusion compared with col . furthermore these observations are in line with the observed increased maternal transmission of the _PROTEIN_ allele in the col background . embryo development arrests in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ alleles the antipodal cells undergo programmed cell death and the timing of this event has been suggested to be in part regulated by the presence of a functional central cell . we therefore inspected pcd of _PROTEIN_ antipodal cells by means of whole mount microscopy . we found no strict correlation between _PROTEIN_ cell fusion and antipodal degeneration in _PROTEIN_ . in dae embryo sacs when approximately half of the mutant _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ were unfused compared with most being fused in the wild type control a relatively similar frequency of antipodal cells was observed in the mutant and in the wild type suggesting that antipodal pcd in _PROTEIN_ is similar to the wild type . notably all antipodals observed in the mutant were correlated with unfused _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ . a simple hypothesis derived from these experiments would be that if _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ were given the time to fuse properly the _PROTEIN_ mutation in ler would segregate as the wild type . to investigate this _PROTEIN_ siliques were pollinated with ler dae and the progeny seeds were selected for the transmission of the mutation . surprisingly the transmission was not restored to the hypothetical ratio but actually _PROTEIN_ compared with the _PROTEIN_ siliques pollinated dae . this may suggest that _PROTEIN_ is also involved in other processes affecting the timing or specification of the egg apparatus . we further examined the role of _PROTEIN_ in the female gametophyte by ectopically _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ splice variants under the control of the promoter of the ubiquitously _PROTEIN_ cell cycle regulator cdka . more than half of the recovered pcdka overexpression lines displayed a variable albeit high frequency of undeveloped seeds at dap . closer inspection of representative procdk _PROTEIN_ lines at the wild type octant embryo stage revealed uniform arrest of to of the female gametophytes before the first mitotic division . similarly procdk _PROTEIN_ lines inspected at the early globular stage of embryogenesis displayed arrest at the one nucleate embryo sac stage in a few cases allowing up to two mitotic divisions . moreover procdk _PROTEIN_ lines also resulted in a variable frequency of aberrant seeds with underdeveloped endosperm suggesting that procdk _PROTEIN_ is less detrimental to embryo sac development than the longer _PROTEIN_ splice form . the transmission efficiency of _PROTEIN_ in pollen and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ at early stages of male gametogenesis suggest that _PROTEIN_ is required for male gametophyte development or function . however upon inspection of whole mount diamidino phenylindole stained pollen of _PROTEIN_ heterozygous plants no obvious phenotype could be detected as all mature pollen contained a vegetative cell and two sperm cells . furthermore _PROTEIN_ was crossed to quartet which is deficient in the separation of microspores after meiosis and thus allows tetrad analysis without revealing any observable phenotype . all pollen could be shown to be viable using alexander s stain . finally to investigate if sperm cell fate is disturbed in _PROTEIN_ pollen we introduced the germ line markers _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and produo duo _METHOD_ . both markers were uniformly _PROTEIN_ in sperm cells of pollen from heterozygous _PROTEIN_ plants and mature _PROTEIN_ pollen were thus by our criteria indistinguishable from those of the wild type . considering the reduced transmission of the mutant allele _PROTEIN_ is therefore suggested to be required for male gametophyte function such as pollen tube growth guidance or fertilization . we therefore compared wild type and _PROTEIN_ pollen tube germination in vitro . the overall germination rate in the mutant was moderately lower than in the wild type . we further compared the frequency of germinating pollen with short tubes between the wild type and mutant . the frequency of germinating pollen with short tubes in the mutant was reminiscent of the wild type frequency and no obvious difference in pollen tube morphology could be observed . albeit not fully explaining the _PROTEIN_ male transmission deficiency our results hint at a requirement for _PROTEIN_ in pollen tube germination . in our _PROTEIN_ analysis gus displayed a modest level of _PROTEIN_ during the early microspore stages but could not be detected in the mature pollen grain . this may suggest that fine tuning of the _PROTEIN_ level is crucial for pollen function . this hypothesis was supported by analyzing pollen development in procdk _PROTEIN_ and procdk _PROTEIN_ lines . two out of six procdk _PROTEIN_ lines examined and four out of nine procdk _PROTEIN_ lines checked displayed high frequencies of aborted pollen . in procdk _PROTEIN_ lines meiosis appeared to be affected producing early stage abortions in microspores . no meiotic defects were detected in procdk _PROTEIN_ lines but microsporogenesis appeared to be hampered already in the first microspore mitosis . since the gametophyte lethality in _PROTEIN_ alleles is not fully penetrant we expected homozygous _PROTEIN_ plants to segregate from a self cross . however no homozygous plants could be identified by genotyping experiments for either allele . since the reduced transmission rates of the mutant alleles can not be explained by gametophyte failure alone the genetic analyses of both alleles therefore suggest that _PROTEIN_ is also required post fertilization . we investigated the requirement of _PROTEIN_ in the developing embryo and endosperm by inspecting cleared whole mount preparations of heterozygous hand pollinated _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ compared with the wild type at to dap . in the wild type the embryo develops through a series of invariant cell divisions resulting in a fully differentiated bent cotyledon embryo . the wild type endosperm proliferates through syncytial _LOCATION_ divisions in parallel with the developing embryo and is gradually consumed by it . in siliques from heterozygous _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ however a significant fraction of the seeds were arrested in development . to rule out gametophyte maternal effects _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were crossed as females to wild type plants . no significant seed abortion was observed in these crosses in agreement with our genetic data suggesting aborted seeds to be homozygous _PROTEIN_ . in _PROTEIN_ the first three to four endosperm _LOCATION_ divisions as well as the initial asymmetric division of the zygote appeared to occur normally up to dap . however subsequent development of the proembryo and the embryo suspensor was not observed in the affected class after this stage . similarly the endosperm did not progress beyond the fourth syncytial division and seemed to start to degenerate in the syncytial state dap . concurrent with the embryo and endosperm arrest no further development or elongation of the ovule integuments were observed . in _PROTEIN_ we observed wild type progression in embryo and endosperm development up to the embryo mid globular stage dap . in wild type globular embryos the cotyledon primordia initiate at dap and are clearly recognizable in the dap heart stage embryo . syncytial endosperm divisions continue and endosperm domains are visible at dap with peripheral endosperm _LOCATION_ lining the endothelium of the inner integuments . _PROTEIN_ embryos however remained in the globular state up to dap . in contrast with the wild type no initiation of cotyledon primordia could be observed from throughout dap . endosperm development was also delayed and syncytial endosperm _LOCATION_ were enlarged and reduced in number and appeared disorganized compared with the wild type . cellularization was not observed up to dap and the endosperm did not appear to degenerate . most _PROTEIN_ seeds still appeared to be viable at dap and these embryos were comparable in size with dap wild type heart stage embryos but entirely lacked the organized cell division pattern and a distinguished bilateral symmetry in the apical region . however upon silique ripening further development of the mutant seeds was not supported . taken together _PROTEIN_ is required for the early stages of embryo and endosperm development as evidenced by the arrest of the _PROTEIN_ proembryo at dap as well as the involvement of _PROTEIN_ in the establishment of bilateral symmetry in the transition from the globular to the heart embryo stage . due to the phenotypic divergence between the _PROTEIN_ alleles we performed reciprocal genetic complementation crosses and inspected the resulting siliques directly . as expected _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ did not complement each other and are therefore allelic . interestingly closer inspection using whole mount cleared preparations revealed that the reciprocal crosses of the two alleles gave rise to the same embryo phenotype of _PROTEIN_ . this finding further supports the zygotic requirement of _PROTEIN_ since one copy of the weaker allele _PROTEIN_ is sufficient to sustain embryo development up to the globular stage _PROTEIN_ of its parental contribution . next we performed molecular complementation using the genomic sequence of _PROTEIN_ and bp of the upstream promoter region . this construct was transformed directly into heterozygous _PROTEIN_ and selected for the presence of both the rescue construct and the _PROTEIN_ allele . in the generation several lines were found to be _PROTEIN_ homozygous indicating full rescue of both the seed and the gametophyte deficiency in _PROTEIN_ plants . we further crossed a line homozygous for _PROTEIN_ and the rescue transgene to a heterozygous _PROTEIN_ plant . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ seeds are lethal without the rescue transgene but trans homozygous plants were identified in the resulting progeny by genotyping indicating that both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are complemented by the _PROTEIN_ transgene . to investigate whether the two _PROTEIN_ splice _METHOD_ have specific roles in gametophyte or embryo development we designed splice variant specific rescue constructs containing the bp _PROTEIN_ promoter fused to the _PROTEIN_ long or short splice form cdna sequence . the constructs were transformed separately into heterozygous _PROTEIN_ and selected for the presence of a splice form rescue construct and the _PROTEIN_ allele . no homozygous _PROTEIN_ plants were obtained in subsequent generations indicating that both splice _METHOD_ or regulatory sequences not present in our transgenes are required for embryo and endosperm development . we further compared the effect of the single splice variant rescue constructs on the transmission of _PROTEIN_ . the overall effect of all _PROTEIN_ rescue construct lines on _PROTEIN_ transmission was not significantly different from that of the _PROTEIN_ controls . however six transgenic lines with elevated transmission were rechecked in the generation and seemed to have a stable higher transmission of indicating that _PROTEIN_ can partially rescue the gametophyte transmission defect in _PROTEIN_ . furthermore the homozygous embryo phenotype in the same outlier lines was partially rescued and arrested at the globular stage similar to the phenotype observed in _PROTEIN_ . this may suggest that _PROTEIN_ is sufficient for embryo development up to the globular stage . however both _PROTEIN_ splice _METHOD_ appear to be required to complete seed development . surprisingly the shorter splice variant _PROTEIN_ led to a _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ transmission . we did not further inspect the possible phenotypic basis of this effect but since the _PROTEIN_ transcript is not physically interrupted by the _PROTEIN_ mutation and we have seen that overexpression of _PROTEIN_ induces gametophyte failure one could speculate that a strict requirement for correct levels of _PROTEIN_ may be needed . the observed phenotype in _PROTEIN_ embryos suggests a defect in the transition to bilateral symmetry in the apical embryo domain . defects in the breakage of radial symmetry are associated with transcription _PROTEIN_ like _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ like or genes relating to auxin signaling or transport . the transcriptional auxin responses required for axialization are mediated by the auxin response _PROTEIN_ protein monopteros _PROTEIN_ and the auxin/indole acetic acid protein _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ has been shown to be directly regulated by _PROTEIN_ in response to auxin in cotyledon tips from the embryo heart stage and onwards and in early heart stage mp embryos _PROTEIN_ is not downregulated in the shoot apical meristem region . we investigated the _PROTEIN_ pattern of a prodrn _METHOD_ _METHOD_ transgene in developing _PROTEIN_ embryos . in the wild type _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ accumulates in the cotyledon initials in the apical part of the globular embryo and remains symmetrically localized throughout the embryo heart stage . a weak signal can be observed at the bent cotyledon stage in addition to accumulation in the shoot meristem . however prodrn _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in globular stage _PROTEIN_ embryos is present in the entire apical domain and appears to be weaker than in wild type embryos similar to the situation at early wild type stages before _PROTEIN_ localization . in subsequent stages _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ localizes to the upper tier of the apical domain of the mutant embryos and occasionally nonsymmetric localization to one of the cotyledon initials could be observed . at _PROTEIN_ stages localization to the cotyledon initials was observed sporadically but the majority of mutant embryos failed to downregulate prodrn _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in the sam domain and possessed uniform localization in the entire uppermost tier . this strongly supports our findings that _PROTEIN_ is required to break radial symmetry and establish bilateral symmetry in the apical embryo domain . we therefore inspected the auxin response pattern in _PROTEIN_ embryos using the synthetic auxin responsive reporter _METHOD_ . in the wild type the basal auxin maxima are restricted to the upper suspensor and hypophysis in the embryo proper . _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in the mutant largely resembles that in the wild type but appears somewhat more variable and is basally expanded in the suspensor and variably reduced in the hypophysis . whereas auxin accumulation was only rarely observed in basal suspensor cells in the wild type this was the most frequent situation in the mutant . auxin maxima in the hypophyseal region were in most cases weak but ranged from virtually absent to a prominent signal . these results do not support a strong link to the auxin response . however an indirect relationship between _PROTEIN_ action and auxin response can not be ruled out . we further investigated endosperm development using specific marker lines . _PROTEIN_ gus was used as an early endosperm marker in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . arrested endosperm _LOCATION_ in _PROTEIN_ seeds _PROTEIN_ the marker however a fraction of the mutant seeds did not show uniform _PROTEIN_ as found in the wild type but _PROTEIN_ was confined to the _PROTEIN_ endosperm region or even appeared to be lost . mutant seeds in heterozygous _PROTEIN_ siliques also displayed a similar _PROTEIN_ gus _PROTEIN_ pattern . _PROTEIN_ gus _PROTEIN_ in micropylar endosperm and peripheral endosperm _LOCATION_ was lost after four to five syncytial divisions and remained in the _PROTEIN_ endosperm region as also seen in the wild type thus suggesting a functional _PROTEIN_ endosperm in the _PROTEIN_ endosperm . similar results were also observed using a _METHOD_ marker . _METHOD_ marks the early stages of syncytial endosperm development and is _PROTEIN_ as a marker of endosperm identity . although delayed compared with the wild type endosperm a uniform _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ pattern could be observed in the _PROTEIN_ endosperm at both the early and _PROTEIN_ stages of embryo development . the lack of bilateral symmetry and the abnormal _PROTEIN_ of a direct target of the arf _PROTEIN_ suggest that _PROTEIN_ may function in the _LOCATION_ possibly by targeting components of the auxin regulatory pathway . however _PROTEIN_ from medaka was recently reported to be localized to the nucleolus and to the cytoplasm . to clarify the subcellular localization of arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ c terminal _METHOD_ fusion constructs of both _PROTEIN_ splice _METHOD_ under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus promoter were transformed into agrobacterium tumefaciens for infiltration of tobacco leaves . inspection of leaves to d after infiltration revealed a strong _LOCATION_ signal for both the long and the short splice _METHOD_ . although weaker than the _LOCATION_ signal both fusion proteins also appeared to be localized to the cytoplasm . to distinguish true cytoplasmic localization we incubated small pieces of the infiltrated leaves in m mannitol for h . upon treatment neither the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ nor the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signals were present in the _LOCATION_ space . the observed signals rather followed the cell wall detached _LOCATION_ creating cytoplasmic strands marked by the _METHOD_ signal . we also designed constructs for overexpression of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in arabidopsis . upon inspection of seedling roots from transformed plants _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was observed in both the _LOCATION_ and the cytoplasm . thus in infiltrated tobacco leaves as well as in arabidopsis roots the _LOCATION_ localization of the fusion proteins appeared to mark the entire _LOCATION_ in contrast with nucleolar localization of its medaka homolog . the presence of a signature wdxr motif suggests that _PROTEIN_ is a potential substrate receptor of the _PROTEIN_ ubiquitin ligase complex . to test this possibility we investigated the interaction between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in reciprocal yeast two hybrid assays using both and _PROTEIN_ as prey and bait . no interaction was detected upon repeated testing . nevertheless it is noteworthy that protein interactions between dcafs and related protein in yeast are often weak and sometimes difficult to detect . therefore we performed bimolecular _METHOD_ complementation experiments to investigate a physical interaction between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in plant cells . plasmids yc _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and yn _PROTEIN_ were cobombarded into etiolated mustard hypocotyls . a strong yellow _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ signal was observed in the _LOCATION_ of cells coexpressing yc _PROTEIN_ and yn _PROTEIN_ and of cells coexpressing yc _PROTEIN_ and yn _PROTEIN_ . these data are similar to those obtained with cells transformed with the positive control yc _PROTEIN_ yn _PROTEIN_ as previously reported . only a weak _METHOD_ signal was observed in < of the cells after bombardment with the negative control plasmid combinations yc _PROTEIN_ yn empty vector and yc _PROTEIN_ yn empty vector . to further support the interaction between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ we performed _METHOD_ resonance energy transfer assays . visual inspection of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ proteins transiently _PROTEIN_ in nicotiana benthamiana plants showed colocalization of the proteins in the _LOCATION_ domain . cotransformed _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ revealed a mean fret value of which was significantly higher than for the negative control using _METHOD_ alone . as a positive control we used _PROTEIN_ which is known to be a strong _PROTEIN_ interactor showing a similar level of interaction as between _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . these results indicate that _PROTEIN_ interacts with _PROTEIN_ and suggest that this protein might act as a _PROTEIN_ substrate recruiter . however our attempts to immunoprecipitate _PROTEIN_ together with _PROTEIN_ remained unsuccessful thus further experimental approaches are required to determine whether _PROTEIN_ acts in the frame of a _PROTEIN_ complex .
the _PROTEIN_ allele was isolated as line in a segregation distortion screen for mutants affected in male or female gametophyte transmission from populations of dissociator transposed insertion lines in arabidopsis thaliana in the ler ecotype . the other plant lines used and _PROTEIN_ were in the col ecotype and are t dna insertion mutants that were obtained from the nottingham arabidopsis stock centre . the insertions in these lines were verified by pcr using gene specific primers and primers against the insert . primer sequences used can be found in supplemental table online . seeds were surface sterilized using ethanol bleach and tween before germination on murashige and skoog media supplemented with suc _METHOD_ . to select for _PROTEIN_ plants kanamycin was added to the media and for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was used . all plants were stratified on _METHOD_ plates at overnight before being incubated at for d until germination . the seedlings were then transferred to soil and grown at under long day conditions . constructs made during this study were transformed into col ler or the _PROTEIN_ mutant using agrobacterium tumefaciens strain or rk by the floral dip method and transformants were selected for by the appropriate resistance encoded in the inserted t dna . to isolate genomic dna from plants for genotyping a quick protocol was followed where a buffer was added to a tissue sample and homogenized . then of this material was used in a pcr reaction . for other purposes such as amplifying genomic sequences for cloning the aqua pure genomic dna isolation kit from bio rad was used according to the manufacturer s instruction manual . for the vectorette pcr genomic dna from the dsg line _PROTEIN_ was isolated and digested using restriction enzymes that have bamhi compatible sites . vectorettes were made to ligate onto the ends of the fragments after the restriction digest by mixing the topl strand and the restriction enzyme specific bottom strand . the vectorettes were then ligated onto the end of the fragments from the restriction digest from the dsg line using ligase . two rounds of nested pcr was performed using the vectorette primers vec and vec and the and end nested primers of the dsg element ds and ds and ds and ds . the pcr products were isolated from the gel using the wizard sv gel and pcr clean up system kit from promega . the isolated dna fragments were cloned using topo ta cloning technology and sequenced . the topo ta cloning technology was used according to the manufacturer s instructions . the vectors used for cloning fragments were pcr or pcr topo . in addition the topo gateway vector was used to clone a genomic fragment _PROTEIN_ to be used as an entry clone in a gateway reaction . constructs were made using gateway technology according to the invitrogen gateway technology manual version e . the dna fragments were amplified using primers with att sites . the donor vector used in all construct design was pdonr/zeo by invitrogen . primers used for creating donor vectors for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were and and and respectively where cdna from wild type col was used as template . these donor vectors were recombined with and padn and _GENE_ and a modified vector where the cdka promoter was replaced with the _PROTEIN_ promoter . for gus _PROTEIN_ studies the _PROTEIN_ promoter region up to the next gene was amplified using the primers sp _GENE_ promoter gateway and asp _GENE_ promoter gateway and the resulting entry clone was recombined with the destination vector . the genomic sequence of _PROTEIN_ and the corresponding bp upstream promoter region were amplified using the primers topo _GENE_ rescue and topo _GENE_ rescue and the fragment was cloned into the topo gateway vector by the topo ta cloning technology . the resulting entry clone was recombined with the destination vector by gateway technology _PROTEIN_ . to test the interaction of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ they were cloned into both and padn . a gateway vector was obtained for _PROTEIN_ from the _PROTEIN_ while a pda clone was obtained from the _PROTEIN_ bio research centre for _PROTEIN_ . the primers and were used to create the entry clone . subcellular localization was performed by making both n and c terminal _METHOD_ fusion constructs with both splice variants _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and transforming these into arabidopsis col ecotype . the _METHOD_ vectors used were and . _METHOD_ was inspected in leaf and root cells under a zeiss axioplan microscope system . to verify fusion tissues from the subcellular _PROTEIN_ lines were harvested and rna was extracted using a spectrum plant total rna kit . rt pcr was performed using primers situated in the gene and in the _METHOD_ sequence to verify fusion after transcription . the controls were cdna from wild type col. for _PROTEIN_ n _METHOD_ primers _METHOD_ and trans were used . for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and trans primers were used . for the control asp _GENE_ rt pcr and sp _GENE_ rt pcr primers were used . primer sequences are presented in supplemental table online . for subcellular localization using the tobacco infiltration protocol the short and long splice variant cdna was recombined with the vector _GENE_ which creates a c terminal _METHOD_ fusion construct . these were then transformed into agrobacterium mixed with agrobacterium harboring the helper construct and infiltrated into nicotiana benthamiana leaves . the leaves were inspected under uv light after to d. some small pieces of the infiltrated leaves were also incubated in m mannitol for h. this treatment results in the expulsion of water from the cell which causes the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ to detach from the cell wall and the _LOCATION_ to shrink allowing for detection of _LOCATION_ proteins . a complementation construct was made to rescue the phenotype in the dsg line _PROTEIN_ which contained the genomic sequence of _PROTEIN_ its promoter region and the untranslated region . this product is bp and ranged from position to on the bac _PROTEIN_ . a splice variant specific complementation construct was made to investigate the role of the two splice variants . the constructs were made by excising the cdka promoter from the gateway vector with the restriction enzymes asci and xhoi and replacing it with the promoter region of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . ligation of dna using ligase was performed according to the manufacturer s instructions and took place at to overnight . cdna from the two splice variants of _PROTEIN_ in the pdonr/zeo vector was then recombined into the modified vector containing the _PROTEIN_ promoter by gateway recombination . rna was isolated from various tissues from wild type arabidopsis ecotype col plants using the spectrum plant total rna kit according to the manufacturer s instructions except all centrifugation was performed at and rna was eluted in . the tissue was harvested in liquid nitrogen in tubes prefilled with ceramic beads and then homogenized with a magna lyser . the isolated rna was treated with dnase i before cdna synthesis using oligo and the reverse transcriptase enzyme superscript iii in the superscript iii first strand synthesis system for rt pcr according to the manufacturer s instructions . the resulting cdna was then purified using the qiaquick pcr purification kit and eluted in . the cdna concentration was measured on a nanodrop spectrophotometer . real time quantitative pcr was performed on cdna from wild type col to determine the _PROTEIN_ level of the gene of interest in different tissues relative to a reference tissue using _PROTEIN_ of as a control . three plants were harvested as one biological replica and three biological replicas were used in total unless otherwise specified . equipment required was the lightcycler instrument and lightcycler multiwell plate available from roche applied science . the primers used to detect _PROTEIN_ were _GENE_ and _GENE_ which give an amplicon of bp . the primers used to detect _PROTEIN_ were asp rt pcr _PROTEIN_ and sp rt pcr _PROTEIN_ giving a bp product . primers for were _PROTEIN_
