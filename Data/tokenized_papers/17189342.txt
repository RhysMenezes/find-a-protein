_PROTEIN_ was previously identified as a potential cytokinesis protein targeted to the cell plate . disruption of _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis thaliana leads to the production of shriveled pollen unable to germinate . vesicular compartmentalization of the mature pollen is dramatically altered and large callose deposits accumulate near the intine cell wall layer . green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ under the control of the pollen promoter complements the phenotype . downregulation of _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis seedlings and tobacco by suspension cells results in crooked cell walls and cell plates that fail to insert into the mother wall . besides accumulating at the cell plate _METHOD_ fused _PROTEIN_ is temporally targeted to a narrow zone at the cell cortex where the cell plate connects to the mother wall . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ also localizes to subcellular structures that accumulate at the pollen tube exit site in germinating pollen . ectopic callose depositions observed in mutant pollen also occur in rna interference plants suggesting that _PROTEIN_ is implicated in cell wall modification . _PROTEIN_ contains domains similar to _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ coat proteins . these data suggest that _PROTEIN_ functions in vesicle trafficking events required for site specific cell wall modifications during pollen germination and for anchoring of the cell plate to the mother wall at the correct cortical position .
a _METHOD_ based screen in by cells identified _PROTEIN_ as a putative cell plate targeted protein . to analyze the relevance of this gene to other species the occurrence of homologous sequences was determined . _PROTEIN_ is unique to plant species and occurs as a singleton located on chromosome in arabidopsis thaliana . there are two copies in rice one on chromosome and one on chromosome . arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ and the rice homologs exhibit a genomic structure of seven exons and six introns . the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ is identical to the rice homologs and identical to a predicted protein sequence from lotus corniculatus var japonicus . a partial est sequence from physcomitrella patens is identical indicating that the protein is highly conserved from mosses to higher plants . the _PROTEIN_ open reading frame predicts a protein with a molecular _METHOD_ of kd and contains domains with similarity to an ef hand motif and an _PROTEIN_ domain as identified by standard analysis . the _PROTEIN_ domain is present in the n terminal part of the large subunits of the ap ap ap and ap _PROTEIN_ protein complexes and in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ subunits of the _PROTEIN_ protein complex . _PROTEIN_ protein complexes and coat protein complexes _PROTEIN_ are involved in clathrin coated and non clathrin coated vesicle formation . besides an _PROTEIN_ like domain _PROTEIN_ carries a stretch of amino acids highly conserved in coatomer proteins _PROTEIN_ . we called this motif the _PROTEIN_ specific element . the composition of the motif was determined as l g sdp x y x e with x indicating any amino acid and amino acids in brackets partially conserved in the _PROTEIN_ protein family . the _PROTEIN_ specific element is conserved in _PROTEIN_ proteins across the different genera . the occurrence of a _PROTEIN_ element and a domain similar to _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ suggests that the _PROTEIN_ protein is related to coat proteins . _PROTEIN_ is interrupted at the third intron by a t dna insertion in the arabidopsis line . sequences adjacent to the insertion site are amplified by pcr with the t dna left border primer and primers of neighboring sequences suggesting that the insertion is an inverted repeat . determination of the t dna bordering sequences confirmed the presence of two left borders and identified the exact position of the insertion site . segregation analysis of heterozygous plants resulted in progeny showing resistance to kanamycin . all kanamycin resistant plants were heterozygous for the t dna insertion . pcr on a population of plants that were grown without selection also yielded the segregation ratio . pollination of wild type plants with pollen from the _PROTEIN_ heterozygous mutant resulted solely in kanamycin sensitive plants indicating that the mutation can not be passed on by the male gametophyte and that the t dna insertion in _PROTEIN_ affects pollen development or germination . by contrast the insertion mutation has no discernible effect on the development of the female gametophyte as seed setting and yield were similar to those of wild type plants . the development of the male gametophyte was analyzed using light and _METHOD_ microscopy . pollen produced by a heterozygous _PROTEIN_ mutant plant is shown in figure . dehiscing anthers were stained with alexander 's stain to discriminate between live and dead pollen . the cytoplasm of viable pollen becomes brightly red whereas dead pollen is not stained by the dye . two types of pollen grains were observed wild type pollen that is oval shaped and shriveled irregularly shaped mutant pollen . the ratio between irregular and normal pollen was . the cytoplasm of the mutant pollen grains stained red with the alexander stain indicating that the pollen is not dead at this stage . yet some of the pollen had collapsed and showed a _PROTEIN_ layer of translucent deposit against the pollen intine wall . to determine the developmental stage and _LOCATION_ composition of the pollen dehiscing anthers were stained with diamidino phenylindole . wild type and mutant pollen carried three _LOCATION_ two male gamete _LOCATION_ and one vegetative _LOCATION_ indicating that _LOCATION_ divisions occurred during pollen development . observation of earlier stages in pollen development did not reveal morphological differences and tetrads as _PROTEIN_ vacuolated bicellular and early trinucleate pollen appeared as in wild type plants suggesting that the mutation affects _PROTEIN_ stages of pollen maturation . to assess the germination capacity of wild type versus mutant pollen grains anthers were spread on germination medium and observed after and h of incubation . in a control experiment of wild type pollen germinated . pollen derived from anthers harvested from mutant plants showed a reduction of germination capacity of and none of the shriveled pollen germinated . the _PROTEIN_ deposits at the cell periphery in mutant pollen grains may have prevented germination by changing the structure of the intine wall layer . to determine the structure and composition of the mutant pollen cell wall sections of plastic embedded whole mount anthers were stained with _METHOD_ cell wall dyes . propidium iodide _PROTEIN_ treatment identified three types of pollen grains . fifty percent of the pollen grains had a normal ellipsoidal morphology and fluoresced homogenously . the other half of the pollen grains showed random deposits of material that was not stained by _PROTEIN_ . in severely affected pollen with a shriveled appearance there was no _PROTEIN_ staining . this type of pollen occurred more frequently in mature anthers and probably represents an end stage in the maturation of the mutant pollen . the deposits were also observed in the representative bright field images . the deposits occurred mostly at the cell periphery therefore the intine cell wall composition was analyzed using calcofluor white and aniline blue staining methods . a mixture of aniline blue and calcofluor white distinctively labels callose _METHOD_ and cellulose _METHOD_ respectively . the wild type intine cell wall was predominantly composed of cellulose and stained brightly blue with calcofluor . the intine wall from shriveled pollen was _METHOD_ in the presence of calcofluor white albeit less pronounced than in wild type grains . hardly any aniline blue _METHOD_ occurred in wild type pollen because very little callose was present in these cells . by contrast brightly yellow _METHOD_ spots occurred in mutant pollen . to analyze the deposits in more detail pollen morphology was determined by means of scanning and transmission electron microscopy . the scanning images revealed that the exine layer of mutant pollen is similarly structured as in wild type pollen . transmission electron microscopic analysis further confirmed that the structure and organization of the exine are normal . figure shows an overview of an ultrathin section of a mutant and a wild type pollen grain . wild type mature pollen is densely packed with vesicles _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ . at the periphery a band of pb acetate stained vesicles concentrates adjacent to the intine layer . closer to the center there are more electron dense vesicles mixed with less numerous vesicles . the peripheral vesicles are presumably involved in secreting polysaccharide cell wall components upon germination and subsequent pollen tube growth . mature mutant pollen grains show an altered composition of the pollen cytoplasm with small and large electron dense bodies . the composition of the cytoplasm in not fully matured mutant pollen with less severe morphological deformations shows an intermediate stage with undulations of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . using a specific antibody directed against callose strong labeling was detected specifically between the intine cellulose layer and the undulated _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ whereas hardly any signal was detected in mature wild type pollen . the altered composition of the mature mutant pollen grains compared with wild type pollen together with the undulations of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ suggest a defect in the regulation of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ surface in the mutant pollen . the failure of mutant _PROTEIN_ pollen to germinate is most likely caused by the ectopic callose deposition between the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and the intine layer . because pollen development requires _PROTEIN_ we determined the localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in germinating pollen . the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein was _PROTEIN_ in pollen from the promoter which is reported to have a pollen specific _PROTEIN_ pattern with only low transcript levels detectable in anther walls and _PROTEIN_ . transcripts driven by the promoter are first detected in spores undergoing pollen mitosis i and then increase substantially in mature pollen . _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ protein _PROTEIN_ from complemented the pollen phenotype of the _PROTEIN_ mutant . the ratio of wild type versus mutant pollen was examined in _PROTEIN_ plants transformed with the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ construct . the plants were heterozygous for both t dnas so complementation of the mutation caused by the insertion of the t dna in the _PROTEIN_ gene should result in a shift from a ratio of wild type versus mutant pollen to a ratio . from pollen grains counted had a wild type appearance and were shriveled . this amounts statistically to the expected ratio of two independently segregating insertions . the complementation was further substantiated by wild type columbia backcrosses . the _PROTEIN_ t dna insertion was transmitted to the wild type plants via pollen that invariably also carried the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ gene . moreover using pcr we identified plants homozygous for the _PROTEIN_ t dna insertion in the backcrossed offspring . we conclude that the _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ protein _PROTEIN_ by the promoter is functional in pollen . in mature pollen _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ from the or the endogenous promoter was cytoplasmic and granular . upon incubation of the pollen in germination medium _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ accumulated at a distinct area at the cell periphery . this region corresponds to the position where the pollen tube emerges . time lapse recording further demonstrated that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ is transported into the growing pollen tube . the localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ at the pollen tube exit site and at the tip of the pollen tube supports a role in the control of vesicle fusion . the pollen maturation phenotype of _PROTEIN_ t dna insertion plants and the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in pollen suggest that the corresponding gene is activated in developing pollen . we analyzed the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ using a genomic fragment containing the open reading frame and bp upstream of the start codon fused to the _PROTEIN_ gene . _PROTEIN_ activity was detected in pollen grains and at the connectivum where the anther is connected to the filament . a thorough study of whole genome gene _PROTEIN_ during different developmental stages of arabidopsis pollen was performed previously . the _PROTEIN_ mrna is _PROTEIN_ in uninucleate microspores and in bicellular and immature tricellular pollen but it is low abundant in dried mature pollen grains . the same study showed that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is not restricted to pollen . _PROTEIN_ was originally identified through homology with a tobacco by cdna aflp tag with an m phase specific upregulation of _PROTEIN_ . we determined _PROTEIN_ mrna levels in arabidopsis roots by whole mount in situ hybridization . transcript was present throughout the root tip meristem although it was not distributed uniformly . the lowest level of _PROTEIN_ was at the very tip end and a stronger _PROTEIN_ occurred near the elongation zone . the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ pattern is in agreement with the results of previous digital in situ results and does not match the _PROTEIN_ pattern of cell cycle controlled genes . thus arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ is not likely to be cell cycle controlled . the presence of _PROTEIN_ transcripts in somatic tissue suggests a role for _PROTEIN_ in somatic processes besides pollen development . arabidopsis lines homozygous for the _PROTEIN_ t dna insertion that also carried the complementing _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ did not show discernible growth or a morphological phenotype . because of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in seedlings as shown by _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and protein gel blot analysis any somatic phenotype is likely to be complemented in the homozygous _PROTEIN_ mutant lines by _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . therefore we decided to suppress _PROTEIN_ activity by posttranscriptional gene silencing . the _PROTEIN_ cdna was _PROTEIN_ from the promoter as a hairpin loop double stranded rna in arabidopsis . two independent hairpin constructs with different backbones yielded transgenic plants that displayed severe growth defects . the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in these plants was assessed by rt pcr . compared with wild type plants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was strongly reduced in the knockdown seedlings . the mrna level of a control gene eif was not affected indicating that the growth defect in knockdown seedlings did not influence the _PROTEIN_ of this household gene . the knockdown seedlings produced _PROTEIN_ cotyledons with an irregular surface and a reduced number of stomata . the hypocotyl was approximately twice as _PROTEIN_ as wild type hypocotyls whereas the root diameter appeared normal . most plants were arrested at an early stage of development although some of them produced a first set of leaves that did not fully expand and had a vitrified appearance . at d after germination mitotic cells were no longer detected by dapi staining and growth was completely arrested . a morphological analysis of _PROTEIN_ stained seedlings revealed the presence of interrupted cell walls and aberrant cell plates in epidermal cotyledon cells as well as in other cell types but these were more difficult to analyze three dimensionally . cellulose polymerization defects and weakening of the cell wall frequently go hand in hand with the stimulation of callose synthesis which besides its role in pollen development normally occurs only in wounded tissue and in developing cell plates . to test the presence of ectopic callose deposition in rna interference arabidopsis plants transgenic material was stained with aniline blue and _METHOD_ was imaged . numerous depositions of ectopic callose were detected in cotyledons and in roots . in wild type plants callose is detected in newly formed cell plates and in the junctions of stomatal guard cells . in rnai seedlings callose depositions were most prominent in root tissue in particular at the root tip . the ectopic deposition of callose in silenced plants and cell cultures is indicative of a malfunctioning of cell wall formation or modification . to investigate the growth inhibition and cytokinesis defects observed in arabidopsis in more detail _PROTEIN_ was silenced in by tobacco suspension cells using a homologous cdna aflp fragment previously isolated from these cells . the _PROTEIN_ rnai calli grew significantly slower than calli transformed with unrelated constructs . in > independent transformation events that were analyzed of the by cells had misplaced cell walls or produced cell walls with severe deformations . examples of aberrant cross walls are presented in supplemental figure online . in addition we observed that cell plates did not always fuse to the mother wall and produced fuzzy extreme ends . figure shows a time lapse recording of a _PROTEIN_ rnai by cell stained with that failed to anchor its newly formed cell plate . the plate is initially made and expands until it reaches the cortex but subsequently fails to insert even when the cell is followed for > min after contact of the cell plate with the cortex . the cell in figure also shows ectopic growth which is commonly observed in _PROTEIN_ rnai by cell lines and may be caused by mistargeting of cell wall modifying _PROTEIN_ as a result of the reduced activity of _PROTEIN_ . the rnai effects in arabidopsis and by cells confirm that _PROTEIN_ is required for somatic cytokinesis and anchoring of the cell plate with the mother wall . root morphology was determined for several rnai plants . the meristematic tissue contained differentiated cells and root hairs emerged close to the tip . figure shows toluidine blue stained transverse sections of wild type and _PROTEIN_ rnai root hypocotyl and hypocotyl sections . some radial patterning can be observed in the rnai seedlings with smaller cells in the vascular bundle surrounded by larger cells of the endodermis cortex and epidermis . however the vascular cylinder in the rnai plants is severely disorganized and cortical layers can not be distinguished clearly . in all transverse _PROTEIN_ rnai hypocotyl sections examined the cyan blue coloration typical for toluidine blue stained wild type xylem vessel cells was absent indicating that these seedlings did not produce differentiated xylem elements . figures and show sections at identical magnifications through the hypocotyl of a wild type and an rnai seedling . the central cylinder and cortical layers are present in the rnai seedling section although it is difficult to discriminate between the different layers . incomplete and malformed cell walls are observed in the cortex of rnai hypocotyls . in addition there are extra random divisions predominantly in the vascular tissue leading to an increase in hypocotyl diameter . the central cylinder cells are not converted to vascular tissue as in the wild type . instead they differentiate to starch containing cells as revealed by lugol staining . starch accumulation inside the vascular bundle was never observed in wild type hypocotyl sections . therefore reducing _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ leads to altered differentiation and extra rounds of cell division predominantly in the vascular bundle . to investigate the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ in a tissue context we analyzed arabidopsis plants carrying an n or c terminally fused _PROTEIN_ construct with _METHOD_ behind the promoter . arabidopsis leaves were imaged with the confocal microscope within the first to h after germination when numerous leaf epidermal cells and root meristematic cells divide . _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was observed _PROTEIN_ in the cytoplasm of nondividing cells with both constructs . during cytokinesis n and c terminally fused _PROTEIN_ concentrated at the developing cell plate . the fusion proteins associated with the newly formed cell plate at an early stage of phragmoplast development . upon contact of the cell plate with the mother wall _METHOD_ _METHOD_ accumulated at the contact site spreading over a region of surrounding the insertion site . the accumulation of _PROTEIN_ fused to _METHOD_ at the division zone together with the observation that in rnai lines cell plates failed to or did not correctly connect to the mother wall suggest that _PROTEIN_ plays a role in anchoring the cell plate to the mother wall .
