myosins are actin activated _PROTEIN_ that use energy to generate force and move along actin filaments dragging with their tails different cargos . plant myosins belong to the group of unconventional myosins and arabidopsis myosin viii gene family contains four members _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ myosin _PROTEIN_ and myosin _PROTEIN_ . in transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusions with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was differentially distributed while in epidermis cells at the root cap _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ equally distributed all over the cell in epidermal cells right above this region it accumulated in dots . further up in cells of the elongation zone _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was preferentially positioned at the sides of transversal cell walls . interestingly the punctate pattern was insensitive to brefeldin a while in some cells closer to the root cap _PROTEIN_ was found in bfa bodies . with the use of different markers and transient _PROTEIN_ in nicotiana benthamiana leaves it was found that myosin viii co localized to the plasmodesmata and _LOCATION_ colocalized with internalized and partially overlapped with the endosomal markers _PROTEIN_ and rarely with _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . motility of _PROTEIN_ labeled organelles was inhibited whenever associated with truncated _PROTEIN_ but motility of _PROTEIN_ labeled organelles was inhibited only when associated with large excess of _PROTEIN_ . furthermore _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ co localized to the same spots on the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ indicating a specific composition at these sites for myosin binding . taken together our data suggest that myosin viii functions differently in different root cells and can be involved in different steps of endocytosis bfa sensitive and insensitive pathways _LOCATION_ tethering and plasmodesmatal activity .
transgenic arabidopsis plants _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ were generated . among tens of seedlings resistant to kanamycin only one seedling _PROTEIN_ detectable levels of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ suggesting some cytotoxicity of the mutant molecule . _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ and passed on to subsequent generations but no significant phenotypes or changes in cell morphology relative to wild type plants were observed . interestingly _METHOD_ of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was visible in the roots but almost undetectable in the shoots and leaves . to verify that the chimera is _PROTEIN_ properly pcr was performed on dna prepared from the transgenic plants and from wt plants as a control and compared to pcr of dna from the plasmid encoding the chimera used to generate the transgenic plants . figure shows that the full length of the expected fragment was detected in the pcr using dna from transgenic plants similar to the fragment obtained from plasmid dna . control plants were negative . western blot analysis confirmed the _PROTEIN_ of the full length chimera and showed that the level of _PROTEIN_ of the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ chimera in transgenic plants is very low compared to the _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ alone in control plants . because of the lack of good anti _PROTEIN_ antibodies in our hands no comparison to endogenous protein 's level of _PROTEIN_ was done . confocal microscope images of roots of the transgenic plants revealed that the chimera _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ is differentially localized in different cells . while in epidermis cells at the root cap _METHOD_ was equally distributed all over the cell in epidermal cells right above this region _METHOD_ accumulated in dots or aggregates of nm in diameter . further up in cells of the elongation zone _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was preferentially positioned at transverse cell walls . this pattern of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ subcellular distribution was found in roots of day old and day old seedlings including the _PROTEIN_ roots of day old seedlings . when a three dimension image of figure was constructed and rotated around its axis it could be distinguished that the dots were scattered around the cells making it difficult to distinguish between _LOCATION_ and cytoplasmic specific localization . in root hairs _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ also formed a pattern of dots . verification of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in transgenic plants . a. pcr was performed using a forward primer corresponding to the end of _METHOD_ starting from the _PROTEIN_ and a reverse primer corresponding to the end of _PROTEIN_ including its stop codon . the size of the expected fragment was bp . the template dna was as follows lane . dna from transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . lane . dna from wt plants . lane . dna from the plasmid used to generate the transgenic plants . lane . molecular weight markers . b . western blot analysis showing sizes and levels of the _PROTEIN_ transgenes lane . _METHOD_ alone . lane .

microscopy . a. root of day old seedling . scale bar . b. _PROTEIN_ root of day old seedling . scale bar . c and c . two images of the same day old seedling root . c shows the root cap scale bar and c

sides . d. _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in root hair scale bar . arrows show the direction of the root caps . unlike in several other species where bfa treatment leads to redistribution of _LOCATION_ proteins to the _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis root cells bfa leads to the formation of bfa bodies that are derived from endosomal _LOCATION_ and accumulate endocytosed markers _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . thus it has been shown that the bfa sensitive process in arabidopsis is endosomal trafficking _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . since myosin viii has been implicated in endocytosis _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ we addressed the question of whether bfa treatment would affect the specific subcellular organization of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in the different root cells and whether _PROTEIN_ would be found in the bfa bodies . figure and shows that bfa treatment did not disrupt the punctate pattern of _PROTEIN_ and no _PROTEIN_ was found in the bfa bodies formed in these particular cells suggesting that here _PROTEIN_ 's function is bfa independent . in contrast in cells closer to the root cap where _PROTEIN_ was equally distributed all over the cell before bfa treatment after bfa treatment it was found in bfa bodies . this suggests that in these cells _PROTEIN_ is bfa sensitive and might be involved in endosomal trafficking at specific developmental stages . for comparison and control transgenic seedling _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ alone were treated with bfa and . in these plants _METHOD_ was diffused all over the cytoplasm of root cells where bfa bodied were detected . to check whether _PROTEIN_ is involved in different steps of endocytosis we used a variety of different endosomal markers . association of _PROTEIN_ with bfa bodies in specific cells . seedlings were treated with bfa and and image acquisition was performed with a confocal microscope . a b . cells with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ organized in dots . a. _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . b. bfa bodies formed in these cells shown

transiently _PROTEIN_ in n. benthamiana leaves using agrobacterium infiltration _METHOD_ accumulated as dots on the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ of abaxial leaf epidermal cells . to verify whether this is a general pattern of localization for myosin viii members we checked _PROTEIN_ myosin _PROTEIN_ and myosin _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ gave a similar pattern of dots while myosin _PROTEIN_ formed smaller dots . myosin _PROTEIN_ was very similar to myosin _PROTEIN_ . the vast majority of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ dots were stationary but rarely less than of the dots were motile . the family members of myosin viii exhibit different _PROTEIN_ patterns as shown by genevestigator analysis _PROTEIN_ . while _PROTEIN_ and myosin _PROTEIN_ are similarly _PROTEIN_ in most organs _PROTEIN_ and myosin _PROTEIN_ are more highly _PROTEIN_ in pollen and to a lesser extent in the stamen and root hairs . it was thus interesting to determine whether the dots formed by _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ overlap in n. benthamiana leaves . _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ were therefore co _PROTEIN_ in these leaves and both localized to the same specific spots on the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . this suggests the existence of specific foci at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ that are able to bind both myosins . interestingly when the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ chimera was co _PROTEIN_ with an _LOCATION_ marker _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ the punctate labeling pattern of _PROTEIN_ correlated with the _LOCATION_ . the same picture was observed with _PROTEIN_ . using aniline blue to stain callose _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was shown to accumulate in plasmodesmata enriched pit fields . to extend our view on the possible involvement of _PROTEIN_ in endocytosis the _LOCATION_ dye was used to follow _LOCATION_ internalization . _PROTEIN_ was found not only at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ but also in the cytoplasm where it co localized with internalized . in addition _METHOD_ chimeras of _PROTEIN_ were co _PROTEIN_ with the endosomal markers _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ orthologs from arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ and dsred _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ domain is a conserved protein motif characterized by its ability to bind with high affinity and specificity to phosphatidylinositol phosphate p a phosphoinositide that is highly enriched in early endosomes _PROTEIN_ and has been shown to co localize with _PROTEIN_ and with internalized in plants . it was found that while _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ labeled organelles were in the cytoplasm in less than of the labeled organelles colocalization with _PROTEIN_ was observed . generally the motility of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ labeled organelles was not affected by the presence of truncated _PROTEIN_ in the same cell probably because most of them were not colocalized . however occasionally both motile organelles co labeled with _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and motionless _PROTEIN_ labeled bodies surrounded by excess of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ could be detected . about of _PROTEIN_ labeled organelles colocalized with _PROTEIN_ at or close to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . importantly while _PROTEIN_ labeled organelles were highly motile in the absence of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in the presence of _PROTEIN_ all co labeled organelles became motionless and only those free from _PROTEIN_ remained motile . the above suggests a major role for _PROTEIN_ in the function of _PROTEIN_ labeled endosomes and a minor role in the function of _PROTEIN_ labeled endosomes . subcellular localization of myosin viii in abaxial leaf epidermis
