tetradecameric clp protease core complexes in non photosynthetic _LOCATION_ of roots flower _PROTEIN_ and in chloroplasts of leaves of arabidopsis thaliana were purified based on native _METHOD_ and isoelectric point and identified by _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . the stoichiometry between the subunits was determined . the protease complex consisted of one to three copies of five different serine type protease clp proteins _PROTEIN_ and four non proteolytic clpr proteins _PROTEIN_ . three dimensional homology modeling showed that the clpp/r proteins fit well together in a tetradecameric complex and also indicated unique contributions for each protein . _PROTEIN_ exit gates for proteolysis products are proposed . in addition unique to land plants tightly interacted with this core complex with one copy of each per complex . the three dimensional modeling show that they do fit well on the axial sites of the clppr cores . in contrast to _LOCATION_ plant mitochondria contained a single kda homo tetradecameric _PROTEIN_ complex without association of clpr or clps proteins . it is surprising that the clp core composition appears identical in all three _LOCATION_ types despite the remarkable differences in _LOCATION_ proteome composition . this suggests that regulation of _LOCATION_ proteolysis by the clp machinery is not through differential regulation of clpp/r/s gene _PROTEIN_ but rather through substrate recognition _METHOD_ and regulated interaction of chaperone like molecules to the clpp/r core .
the complexity of the clp gene family in a. _PROTEIN_ analysis of the sequenced a. thaliana _LOCATION_ genome indicates the presence of clp related genes with genes predicted to encode for _LOCATION_ or mitochondrial proteins . an additional clpp gene is located on the _LOCATION_ genome . the subcellular localizations of of these organellar proteins have been experimentally determined in this study and/or in earlier studies . recently a new protein clps was identified in e. coli . this bacterial clps binds to the n terminus of clpa and affects substrate specificity . interestingly a homologue is also present in the a. thaliana genome and sequence analysis suggests chloroplast localization . the bacterial clps protein is not related to which we identified as part of the chloroplast clppr complex . the clp gene family can be divided into three groups of clpp/r _PROTEIN_ and clpt . the chaperone genes are predominantly located on chromosome whereas the clpp r and t genes are mostly on chromosome . analysis of the mitochondrial and _LOCATION_ chaperones _PROTEIN_ shows conservation of a i gf motif combined with an upstream basic residue in all sequences but _PROTEIN_ . in _PROTEIN_ of e. coli this motif is implicated in interaction with the clp core . this suggests that eight of nine _LOCATION_ and mitochondrial chaperones might interact with clp cores as will be further discussed below . this paper we will often refer to clp proteins and genes from e. coli . for the sake of clarity and to save space we will refer to all e. coli clp proteins as eclp . unless otherwise specified all other proteins are from a. thaliana . clp cores and chaperones in chloroplasts of a. an earlier study we identified an kda clp core complex copurified with the _LOCATION_ by blue native gel electrophoresis _PROTEIN_ followed by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ . six clp proteins _PROTEIN_ three clpr proteins _PROTEIN_ and a completely new protein assigned were identified in this core complex . the heterogeneity of the clp complex and the identification of a new clp protein was extremely surprising . at that time we did not identify _PROTEIN_ and both predicted to be targeted to the chloroplast . in the current study by using native isoelectric focusing and a very mild native _METHOD_ gel system we identified the stromal clp core complexes in chloroplasts as well as non photosynthetic _LOCATION_ in roots and _PROTEIN_ and we reanalyzed the composition of the _LOCATION_ associated clpprs core . fig . a and b shows the two dimensional separation of stromal and _LOCATION_ associated clp cores with colorless native gel electrophoresis _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ as the first dimension . we changed from bn _PROTEIN_ to _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ because this resulted in greater stability of several chloroplast protein all stained protein spots were analyzed by a combination of _PROTEIN_ assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and nano lc esi _METHOD_ . the purification of clp complexes their gel based separation and _METHOD_ analysis were repeated several times . the relevant _METHOD_ data are listed in table a and b of the supplemental material whereas complementary maldi tof _METHOD_ data are not shown . the criteria for positive identification are described under experimental procedures. we have indicated the clp complex in fig . a and b and also numbered the most abundant proteins around the clp complex . about of the clp core was soluble in the stroma and was associated with the _LOCATION_ . in both complexes four clpr proteins _PROTEIN_ two clps proteins as well as five of six clpp proteins _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were identified by _METHOD_ . thus we now also identified and _PROTEIN_ in the core complex . _PROTEIN_ was also identified in the _LOCATION_ associated complex but not in the stromal complex . further below we demonstrate that this was because of a minor mitochondrial contamination . protein spots in the area around the clp complex were all identified by _METHOD_ and were unrelated to the clp machinery . the _PROTEIN_ chaperone was identified in the stroma as a dimeric complex of kda . a very large number of sequence tags generated by _METHOD_ were identified matching to both the and _PROTEIN_ protein . a number of tags were unique for _PROTEIN_ and none were unique to _PROTEIN_ . thus the dimer certainly contained _PROTEIN_ and probably not _PROTEIN_ . we searched for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and a small gel spot with _PROTEIN_ was found in the interface of the stacking gel of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ dimension . separation of stromal complexes by sucrose gradient fractionation and native isoelectric focusing chloroplast clp complex always migrated on both the bn _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ gels as a single heteromeric complex of kda . however it is still possible that the complex observed in the gels is in _PROTEIN_ a mixture of different complexes with approximately the same _METHOD_ . to elucidate this important point stromal complexes were separated based on their native pi values rather than native _METHOD_ . if indeed clp core complexes of different composition exist they are likely to migrate at different pi values because the predicted pi of the different processed clpp r and s subunits vary widely between and . stromal complexes were first separated by sucrose density gradient centrifugation to allow removal of the majority of the very abundant kda ribulose bisphosphate _PROTEIN_ complex . this helped to improve the identification of a possible heterogeneous clp core population . the fractions containing the clp complexes were collected and separated on native ief tube gels with a pi from to followed by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . extensive maldi tof _METHOD_ and nano lc esi _METHOD_ analysis of all visible protein spots indicated that all clp complexes migrated between pi and in a narrow pi range . the sucrose gradient fractions were then analyzed on a narrower pi range gel to improve resolution . fig . shows the chloroplast clp complex migrating at pi of . extensive _METHOD_ analysis showed that it contained the same set of clp proteins similarly as the kda complex separated based on native _METHOD_ . this suggests that there is a single clp core complex with the same subunit composition . it is however possible that there is a mixture of clp core complexes with the same composition but with different spatial arrangements _PROTEIN_ or less likely that minor differences in composition do not affect the native pi value . but it is unlikely that there are clp complexes with a strongly reduced complexity because they would likely have been separated based on either native _METHOD_ or native pi value . stoichiometry of _LOCATION_ clpp/r/s e. coli eclpp core is formed by two _PROTEIN_ of seven eclpp proteins each . based on our modeling work in this paper we infer that the _LOCATION_ clpp/r proteins form a similar _PROTEIN_ structure and that and can not form part of this _PROTEIN_ structure but instead are peripherally associated . thus the _LOCATION_ clpp/r core must contain clpp/r proteins . given the presence of different clpp/r proteins this means that a number of clpp/r proteins are present in more than one copy . we thus set out to determine the stoichiometry of the core subunits in the clp complex . this is a rather _PROTEIN_ task because the proteins migrate very closely together in the range of to kda . stromal clp cores were separated by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ followed by high resolution _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ with acrylamide . _METHOD_ staining and nano lc esi _METHOD_ analysis indicated that and _PROTEIN_ now separated as individual spots . the integrated staining intensities of these pure proteins were quantified by image analysis and indicated that the staining volumes of and are very comparable . for the conversion of these staining volumes into molar ratios it is important to take the amino acid composition into consideration because both silver and _METHOD_ stain bind preferentially to either lys or lys his tyr and arg residues _METHOD_ . table ii lists the number of these residues for all clp core proteins . and have both a total of lys arg his tyr amino acid residues and the _METHOD_ staining volumes are thus proportional to their molar ratios . this indicates that and are present in equal molar ratios in the clp core population . the staining volume of the pure _PROTEIN_ spot was about times higher than for or . however _PROTEIN_ has a total of lys arg his and tyr residues and its molecular size is kda whereas the apparent molecular _METHOD_ of the clps proteins is kda . together this suggest that the _PROTEIN_ molar ratio is . we thus conclude that _PROTEIN_ and are present in approximately equal molar ratios . because the other spots contained mixtures of the other clp proteins we sought further separation . purified clp cores on native gels were separated first by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ with acrylamide and then the gel lane was incubated in _PROTEIN_ and urea and separated by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ with acrylamide . protein spots were stained with _METHOD_ but because staining was relatively weak they were destained and then restained with _METHOD_ compatible silver stain . both images were quantified and spots were subsequently identified by nano lc esi _METHOD_ . now _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were separated as individual spots whereas _PROTEIN_ and were still partially overlapping as were _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and . the staining volume of _PROTEIN_ was about of _PROTEIN_ and . the staining volume of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and their molecular _METHOD_ are approximately identical . however _PROTEIN_ has lysine residues whereas _PROTEIN_ has only . this suggests that the molar ratio between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ is about . _PROTEIN_ has lys residues nearly the same as _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ is only kda smaller than _PROTEIN_ . given the staining volume of _PROTEIN_ as compared with _PROTEIN_ this suggests that the molar ratio between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ is about . in our earlier paper we suggested that _PROTEIN_ is probably more abundant than _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ which was based on multiple strongly dominating peptide ions derived from _PROTEIN_ in both maldi tof _METHOD_ and esi _METHOD_ . indeed as shown in fig . _PROTEIN_ was found in three adjacent spots whereas and were found together in one spot . most likely _PROTEIN_ and run closely together in this spot with the presence of _PROTEIN_ being a minor contamination from the adjacent pure _PROTEIN_ spots . considering that _PROTEIN_ has only lys and that the total staining volume of the two spots with pure _PROTEIN_ is about of those of and we suggest that the molar ratio between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ is at least . taken these data together we conclude that the approximate molar stoichiometries between is about . considering all gels the low lysine content of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and the comparable number of sequence tags obtained by _METHOD_ from both and we speculate that _PROTEIN_ and are present at approximately equal molar ratios to each other and and . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ clustered together in most gels and the staining volume both in _METHOD_ and silver stain _METHOD_ quite similar or somewhat less than of _PROTEIN_ . we tentatively suggest that the molar ratio between the sum of _PROTEIN_ is comparable with the sum of _PROTEIN_ . this roughly leads to a approximate stoichiometry of _PROTEIN_ totaling proteins per core . clp cores in _LOCATION_ of roots and _PROTEIN_ in the genus have a large number of biochemical functions and are present in both photosynthetic tissues _METHOD_ and non photosynthetic tissues such as roots and flowers . the proteome composition between non photosynthetic and photosynthetic _LOCATION_ is very and might require different proteolytic _METHOD_ . one could expect that the _PROTEIN_ clp machinery is different in these non photosynthetic _LOCATION_ types as compared with the chloroplast clp complex as an adjustment to the substrate requirements . we therefore determined the clp composition in non photosynthetic _LOCATION_ from roots and flower _PROTEIN_ from b. rapa and b. oleracea respectively . due to the much larger size of their roots and flowers respectively they are a much better source for purification of non photosynthetic _LOCATION_ than a. thaliana . these brassica species and a. thaliana belong to the brassicaceae family and their proteomes share a very high degree of protein sequence identity . alignment of the genomic sequences of several clp genes in b. oleracea and a. thaliana indicates an average sequence identity of more than between processed clp orthologues . we are therefore confident that the correct orthologue was identified when searching the a. thaliana data base with _METHOD_ data from b. rapa and b. oleracea proteins . _LOCATION_ were isolated from b. rapa roots and b. oleracea _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ using newly developed protocols . the soluble stromal proteomes from both _LOCATION_ types were separated by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in the dimension followed by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . the most abundant proteins were identified by maldi tof _METHOD_ and nano lc esi _METHOD_ . the protein patterns of these two dimensional gels showed that the clp protease is the most abundant stromal protease in non photosynthetic _LOCATION_ similarly as in the chloroplast fig . a and b shows the region of complexes between kda and at this _METHOD_ resolution one clp core was found for both organs . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and were all identified in these complexes by _METHOD_ . the _METHOD_ data are summarized in the table a and b of the supplemental material . _PROTEIN_ was found in root _LOCATION_ but not in flower _LOCATION_ most likely due to a minor contamination of mitochondria . similarly as for the chloroplast stroma _PROTEIN_ was identified as an kda complex in both _LOCATION_ types and similarly as in chloroplast the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was the _PROTEIN_ species . _PROTEIN_ was identified as a soluble kda dimer in _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ . we do want to point out that _PROTEIN_ phosphorylase was present as a kda complex on the stromal maps of all three _LOCATION_ types and _METHOD_ an excellent reference for this region of the gels . we then separated stromal proteomes of both non photosynthetic _LOCATION_ by nief . in both _LOCATION_ the clp core complex migrated as a single complex in a very focused manner strongly supporting the results from _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . the clp core in mitochondria of potato investigate the clp machinery in plant mitochondria potato tubers were used as a rich and established source of pure mitochondria . the soluble _PROTEIN_ proteome was separated by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and all stained protein spots were analyzed by _METHOD_ . _PROTEIN_ was identified by nano esi _METHOD_ only in one location on the two dimensional gel suggesting that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ an kda complex . the sequence alignment between _PROTEIN_ of a. thaliana and solanum tuberosum indicated an identity over amino acid residues with much less sequence identity to the other a. thaliana clp proteins . protein spots in the area above and below _PROTEIN_ were all identified by _METHOD_ and were kda heat shock proteins and _PROTEIN_ synthase subunits all unrelated to the clp machinery . no evidence was found for accumulation of any other clpp r s proteins other than _PROTEIN_ as expected from localization prediction and western blotting for _PROTEIN_ . thus the plant mitochondrial clp core is homomeric in composition similar as in other eukaryotes . the presence of _PROTEIN_ chaperones subunits _PROTEIN_ is under investigation . because _PROTEIN_ was found in the _LOCATION_ fraction and in root _LOCATION_ and because the subcellular localization prediction is ambiguous we verified localization of _PROTEIN_ by using an approach not dependent on purification of organelles . we therefore cloned the full length cdna directly upstream of the gene encoding for green _METHOD_ protein and we transformed tobacco leaves with this construct under the control of a strong constitutive promoter by biolistic bombardment . the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein was transiently _PROTEIN_ in tobacco leaves . cells _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ showed green _METHOD_ in globular structures identified as mitochondria . clearly all the green _METHOD_ was excluded from the chloroplasts identifiable by the red _METHOD_ . as a positive control for mitochondrial targeted _METHOD_ we used the coxiv _METHOD_ fusion protein from ref . citation . compatibility between the clpp/r proteins and unique investigate the structural compatibility of the different clpp/r proteins unique structural contributions of the different clpp/r/s subunits and to determine the location of clps in the clp complex we used the structural information of the homotetradecameric clpp core complex at resolution and the clpa n domain at resolution in e. coli by x ray crystallography . the six clpps and four clprs proteins from a. thaliana are homologous to eclpp for most of the sequence lengths with the exception of or residue insertions in _PROTEIN_ and extended c termini for several clpp/r proteins . the x ray crystal structure of was used as a template to build three dimensional models for all clpp/r proteins . the residue insertions occur at equivalent sequence positions with reference to the template . to model these insertions and the extended c termini we identified structural neighbors of using the combinatorial extension method . among these structures are the monomeric units of both chlorobenzoyl coenzyme a dehalogenase and _PROTEIN_ enoyl coa isomerase _PROTEIN_ . these proteins show very little sequence identity with eclpp despite their very high structural similarities with . modeling the non catalytic monomers _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ indicates that the insertion loop replaces some of the residues forming the oxyanion hole in the catalytic units and lies over the catalytic clefts between the head domains and the handles i.e . they fill the volume between strands and that constitutes the substrate binding pocket in the catalytic units . sequence alignments of the monomers of based on the structural alignment obtained from the combinatorial extension method and the blast alignments of the clpp/r sequences with the eclpp sequence are shown in fig . . information about the secondary structure elements is also indicated . the extended c termini the clpp/r proteins could be modeled using and because they share a well defined pattern at their c terminal ends formed by two to four helical fragments . modeling suggests that the extended c termini present in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ can form helical structures that can fold over the top of the barrel like core structure . an example for a three dimensional model is shown for _PROTEIN_ superimposed on eclpp . after constructing reliable three dimensional models for all clpp and clpr monomers we created models for different hetero tetradecameric _LOCATION_ clp cores as well as for the homo tetradecameric _PROTEIN_ core from mitochondria . all possible contacts between different types of monomers were generated and indicated that the different clpp and cpr proteins could be part of the same tetradecameric _PROTEIN_ structure without obvious incompatibilities . the root mean square deviations of the atomic positions obtained after optimal superposition of the structures of the template and the clpp/r models are low showing that the models are highly reliable . all models were carefully analyzed by visual inspection and validated using the program what_check . putative _PROTEIN_ openings in the clp conservation of two arg residues present in all clpp/r proteins motivated us to look into their three dimensional environment in and the modeled proteolytic clppr cores . careful analysis of this part of the structures suggests putative _PROTEIN_ openings that connect the interior of the central cavity with the outside . two types of putative exits/entrances can be observed . the first type is located at the interface of the two _PROTEIN_ and it is formed by residues contributed by four different units i.e . two from each _PROTEIN_ with a total of openings per core . these openings measure in diameter and are remarkably _PROTEIN_ . the type of residues lining the opening varies depending on the clpp/r monomers that contribute to the site . however two conserved arg residues are present in all clpp/r and contributed to these openings by opposite monomers . one of these arg residue precedes the catalytic asp residue in all clpp proteins . we also observed that the insertion loops in _PROTEIN_ can contribute with additional _PROTEIN_ residues to flank the internal lips of the _PROTEIN_ opening when the monomers are located in any of the two positions shown in blue in the diagram shown in fig . . all combinations of monomers _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ character of this putative opening with the only exception of . a two residue insertion in may block or partially close this opening when occupies the two positions shown in red in the diagram . we suggest that these _PROTEIN_ openings may provide fast exit routes for the proteolytic products . the second type of putative opening occurs between the two closest catalytic sites located in neighboring monomers on the same _PROTEIN_ thus with putative openings per core . the walls of these putative openings are formed largely by residues located in helices d and e in the first monomer and residues in strands and in the second monomer . a large number of hydrophobic residues flank the internal walls of these putative channels and fluctuations of the side chains of these residues can provide an oval like opening with maximum and minimum radii of about and respectively . modeling of and their interaction with the _LOCATION_ clppr with blast and the threading tool for indicate excellent sequence to structure alignments with the n terminal domain of eclpa recently deposited by guo et al . . this n terminal domain is assigned here as the n domain. the alignments were used to build three dimensional models of . the models of show that most of the hydrophobic residues constitute the central core of the structure and are probably important for structural reasons only . on the other hand conserved residues arg glu arg and ser may be involved in functional aspects of clps . our conclusions are based on the following the accessibility of these residues and on the x ray experimental structure of the n terminal domain of eclpa bound to eclps of ref . citation that shows the equivalent glu and ser interacting with eclps . the latter x ray crystal complex also shows that two loops in eclpa provide most of the surface of interaction with eclps . the equivalent loops in clps involve loop from arg to glu in and loop from asp to leu in . residues in these two loops are shown in magenta and orange respectively . it should be noted that only the first loop involving residues arg to glu is inside the region recognized as the n domain . given that the modeled structures of the clps proteins are quite different in shape from the clpp/r proteins it is highly unlikely that is part of the heptameric _PROTEIN_ . in contrast the surfaces of the clp core and show a number of complementarities in shape and hydrophobicity/polarity . our models of the proteolytic core show the hydrophobic pockets near the axial entrances as possible regions for binding . as we mentioned above our models for all the clpp r monomers with the exception of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ indicate that the pockets may be occluded by the c termini of the monomers forming the site . when exposed the grooves always show very good surface complementarity with the epitope formed by loops and in . in addition the highly aromatic characters of the pockets on the core complex and the epitope can provide the elements for a tight binding between the two molecules whereas some of the conserved charged residues e.g . arg and glu in and glu in the clpp r may provide the steering guidance to orient the two molecules during binding . the gf motif as mentioned earlier might be involved in a different way of interaction .
