methyl cpg binding domain proteins in arabidopsis thaliana bind in vitro methylated cpg sites . here we aimed to characterize the binding properties of atmbds to chromatin in arabidopsis _LOCATION_ . by _PROTEIN_ in wild type cells atmbds fused to green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ we showed that _PROTEIN_ was evenly distributed at all chromocenters whereas _PROTEIN_ and showed preference for two perinucleolar chromocenters adjacent to nucleolar organizing regions . _PROTEIN_ previously shown to be incapable of binding in vitro methylated cpg was dispersed within the _LOCATION_ excluding chromocenters and the nucleolus . recruitment of _PROTEIN_ and to chromocenters was disrupted in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutant cells where a significant reduction in cytosine methylation occurs . in these mutant cells however _PROTEIN_ accumulated at chromocenters . no effect on localization was observed in the mutant showing reduced cpnpg methylation or in kyp displaying a reduction in lys histone methylation . transient _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ fused to _METHOD_ showed that _PROTEIN_ shares common sites with atmbd proteins . glutathione s transferase pull down assays demonstrated that atmbds bind _PROTEIN_ the mbd motif was sufficient for this interaction . our results suggest that the subnuclear localization of atmbd is not solely dependent on cpg methylation _PROTEIN_ may facilitate localization of atmbds at specific _LOCATION_ domains .
we previously have shown that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ bind in vitro methylated cpg sites whereas _PROTEIN_ and do not . to study the interaction of atmbds with methylated dna in vivo atmbds were tagged at their c termini with _METHOD_ and placed downstream from the promoter . the _METHOD_ fusion constructs were transformed into arabidopsis leaf protoplasts by the polyethylene glycol methodology . in arabidopsis methylated dna is found _PROTEIN_ at heterochromatic chromocenters . in transient _PROTEIN_ assays _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was evenly distributed at all chromocenters whereas _PROTEIN_ and showed preference for two large domains adjacent to the nucleolus . by contrast _PROTEIN_ previously shown incapable of binding in vitro methylated cpg sites was dispersed within the _LOCATION_ but excluded from chromocenters and the nucleolus . in stably transformed plants _PROTEIN_ and generally followed the subnuclear localization pattern found in transient _PROTEIN_ except for guard cells where the distribution was at multiple subnuclear domains . immunolabeling assays using anti _METHOD_ on _LOCATION_ prepared from transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ showed colocalization with the intensely diamidino phenylindole stained chromocenters . together these results demonstrate the association of atmbds with methylated cpg rich chromatin in planta and suggest the involvement of additional _PROTEIN_ in determining their preference for specific _LOCATION_ domains . we estimated the strength of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ binding with chromatin by salt extraction of _LOCATION_ prepared from transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . _LOCATION_ were incubated in the presence of increasing concentrations of nacl after which the soluble and the insoluble pellet fractions were resolved by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . immunoblotting analysis using _METHOD_ showed that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was composed of two fractions a major fraction which was tightly associated with chromatin and could not be released even under mm nacl and a minor fraction which was loosely associated with chromatin and was released to the soluble fraction with as low as mm nacl . as expected a control histone was strongly associated with chromatin as revealed with anti methylated histone . we also analyzed whether the dispersal of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ within the _LOCATION_ reflects the presence of _PROTEIN_ in the soluble _LOCATION_ fraction . _LOCATION_ prepared from transgenic arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were subjected to salt extraction . results showed that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ is not found in the soluble fraction but rather strongly bound to chromatin . to verify the association of atmbds with chromocenters we employed chromatin immunoprecipitation _PROTEIN_ assay on _LOCATION_ prepared from transgenic arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . the antibodies used recognize _METHOD_ _METHOD_ dimethylated a known histone modification associated with transcriptionally active chromatin as well as dimethylated a known histone modification associated with chromatin compaction and gene silencing . precipitated dnas were subjected to pcr to amplify a set of dna sequences including centromeric bp repeats _PROTEIN_ the rdna as well as actin encoding sequence . results showed that anti _METHOD_ precipitated _PROTEIN_ and rdna but not the actin encoding sequence . the association of the rdna with both and dimethylated histone reflects the diverse chromatin configurations of rrna gene clusters being either transcriptionally active or inactive . as expected the actin encoding sequence was precipitated _PROTEIN_ with slightly with but not with _METHOD_ confirming the association of _PROTEIN_ with the transcriptionally inactive chromatin . the two large perinucleolar domains to which _PROTEIN_ and bind are likely to define chromocenters of the acrocentric chromosomes and/or which together with the nucleolar organizing region form a large domain of heterochromatin . to assess this possibility fixed _LOCATION_ from transgenic arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were first immunolabeled with anti _METHOD_ followed by _METHOD_ in situ hybridization with tetramethylrhodamine dutp labeled _PROTEIN_ or rdna . results showed that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ colocalized with the intensely dapi stained chromocenters and was associated with _PROTEIN_ displaying preference for perinucleolar chromocenters adjacent to the rdna . thus _PROTEIN_ and preferentially bind chromocenters of chromosome and/or where they might regulate chromatin compaction and silencing of rrna genes . to confirm the preference of _PROTEIN_ and for methylated cpg sites we examined the distribution of atmbd _METHOD_ in three arabidopsis dna methylation mutants _PROTEIN_ a mutation in the _PROTEIN_ gene encoding the chromatin remodeling _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ a mutation in _PROTEIN_ dna methyltransferase of which show reduction in cpg methylation _PROTEIN_ a mutation in the _PROTEIN_ gene that reduces cpnpg and cpnpn methylation . reduced dna methylation in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ was demonstrated by the sensitivity of the centromeric bp repeats as well as the rdna to digestion by the methylation sensitive hpaii enzyme . in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ cells the subnuclear localization of _PROTEIN_ and was disrupted . a greater effect was observed in _PROTEIN_ cells where _PROTEIN_ and were evenly dispersed within the _LOCATION_ . in _PROTEIN_ as well as in _PROTEIN_ cells where cpg methylation is thought to be almost completely lacking _PROTEIN_ and showed patchy distribution with a certain fraction of these proteins still associated with chromocenters . to quantify these differences we compared the magnitude of fluctuation in _METHOD_ intensity by determining the coefficient of variation for each population of _LOCATION_ using the _PROTEIN_ image program . in wild type cells the coefficient of variation was the highest indicating very high fluctuation in _METHOD_ intensity of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ within the _LOCATION_ . the coefficient of variation for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ was significantly higher than that of _PROTEIN_ thus confirming higher fluctuation in _METHOD_ intensity for _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in _PROTEIN_ mutants compared with _PROTEIN_ . in the _PROTEIN_ mutant subnuclear localization of atmbd _METHOD_ proteins was similar to that found in wild type plants . these results verified the importance of cpg methylation in controlling _PROTEIN_ and subnuclear localization . interestingly in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutant cells _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was accumulated at chromocenters as confirmed by immunolabeling/fish assay on _LOCATION_ derived from transgenic _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . this redistribution however can not be accounted for by direct binding of _PROTEIN_ to unmethylated cpg sites inasmuch as glutathione s transferase _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ failed to form complexes with unmethylated sites in electrophoretic mobility shift assays . our results demonstrated a role for cpg methylation in the subnuclear localization of atmbds . the difference however between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ concerning the localization of _PROTEIN_ and prompted us to investigate possible association between _PROTEIN_ and atmbd proteins . to this end we first tested whether _PROTEIN_ and atmbds occupy common _LOCATION_ domains . _PROTEIN_ cdna was subcloned downstream from the promoter and upstream from _METHOD_ to generate _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein . this construct was transformed into arabidopsis leaf protoplasts and inspected under a confocal microscope h after transformation . results showed two types of localization for _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in arabidopsis leaf _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was either localized at chromocenters similarly to _PROTEIN_ and or evenly dispersed throughout the _LOCATION_ similarly to the distribution pattern of _PROTEIN_ in wild type cells . thus atmbds and _PROTEIN_ occupy common _LOCATION_ domains . we next investigated physical interaction between atmbds and the _PROTEIN_ protein using the _PROTEIN_ pull down assay . glutathione sepharose containing _PROTEIN_ alone or _PROTEIN_ fused with various atmbds were incubated with in vitro translated labeled _PROTEIN_ full length protein and after extensive washing samples were resolved on _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and exposed to a phosphor imager . results showed that all _PROTEIN_ atmbd proteins but not _PROTEIN_ alone bound to the full length _PROTEIN_ protein . the mbd motif alone either of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was sufficient for this interaction . the deletion/frameshift caused by the _PROTEIN_ allele occurs at amino acid leading to premature translation termination upstream from the predicted helicase c terminal domain . we therefore analyzed possible interaction between atmbds and the c terminal region of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ using the n terminal region of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ as a control . both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were capable of binding to the c terminal region of _PROTEIN_ though at a reduced affinity compared with the full length _PROTEIN_ . no significant interaction of atmbds with the _PROTEIN_ n terminal region _PROTEIN_ could be detected . to confirm this interaction we performed reciprocal assays and analyzed the capability of the full length _PROTEIN_ fused to _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ to precipitate the _PROTEIN_ from _LOCATION_ extract derived from transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . to this end _PROTEIN_ alone _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ as well as _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ immobilized onto glutathione sepharose were mixed with _LOCATION_ extract and after incubation and extensive washing precipitated proteins were resolved on _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and immunoblotted using anti _METHOD_ . results showed that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ but not _PROTEIN_ alone or _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were capable of precipitating _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ from _LOCATION_ extract . these results further support physical interaction between _PROTEIN_ and the chromatin remodeling _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants dimethylation at chromocenters is reduced . to assess the involvement of dimethylation in recruiting atmbds to chromocenters we transiently _PROTEIN_ atmbd _METHOD_ constructs in kyp cells where dimethylation at chromocenters is significantly reduced whereas cpg methylation at centromeres is unaffected . results showed that the distribution of atmbd _METHOD_ proteins in kyp was similar to that of wild type plants suggesting that dimethylation is dispensable for the localization of atmbds at chromocenters .
