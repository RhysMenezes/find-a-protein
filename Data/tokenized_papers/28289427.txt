plant non specific lipid transfer proteins belong to a complex multigenic family implicated in diverse physiological processes . however their function and mode of action remain unclear probably because of functional redundancy . among the different roles proposed for nsltps it has long been suggested that they could transport cuticular precursor across the cell wall during the formation of the cuticle which constitutes the first physical barrier for plant interactions with their aerial environment . here we took advantage of the arabidopsis thaliana etiolated hypocotyl model in which was previously identified as the unique and abundant nsltp member in the cell wall proteome to investigate its function . _PROTEIN_ was restricted to epidermal cells of aerial organs in agreement with the place of cuticle deposition . furthermore transient _METHOD_ over _PROTEIN_ in nicotiana benthamiana leaf epidermal cells resulted in its localization to the cell wall as expected but surprisingly also to the _LOCATION_ indicating an original dual trafficking for a nsltp . remarkably in etiolated hypocotyls the mutant displayed modifications in cuticle permeability together with a disorganized ultra structure at the cuticle cell wall interface completely recovered in complemented lines whereas only slight differences in cuticular composition were observed . thus may not play the historical purported nsltp shuttling role across the cell wall but we rather hypothesize that could play a major structural role by _PROTEIN_ the integrity of the adhesion between the _PROTEIN_ hydrophobic cuticle and the hydrophilic underlying cell wall . altogether these results gave new insights into nsltp functions .
in order to investigate the function of the a. thaliana insertion line in which the promoter is disrupted by a t dna insertion was studied . a homozygous mutant line and its wild type counterpart were selected during a genotyping screen . the genomic sequence of including native regulatory sequences and the unique intron was used to transform homozygous plants finally leading to the selection of homozygous independent complemented lines . three of them were selected for further studies . is a strong knock down mutant . organization of the genomic sequence showing the t dna insertion in the mutant . the displayed bp sequence containing native regulatory sequences was cloned and used for complementation of . legend exon intron utr . the arrows show the position of primers used for rt qpcr

assessed by a student s t test . electrophoresis profiles of proteins extracted from cell walls of day old wt and _PROTEIN_ seedlings . the numbers on the left indicate the position of protein molecular _METHOD_ markers in kda . the arrow shows the position of the kda band containing . firstly _PROTEIN_ was investigated by rt qpcr on etiolated seedlings during days timing starting at the time of transfer to dark after synchronization of germination by light exposure for h. in wt seedlings the level of accumulation of transcripts showed a significant fold increase between and h and peaked at h before _PROTEIN_ to the same level as at h . a to fold reduction in the accumulation of transcripts was observed in seedlings as compared to wt between h and days . an _PROTEIN_ pattern similar to that of wt was retrieved in the three selected independent complemented lines . to further characterize these lines we have performed a maldi tof _METHOD_ analysis of proteins extracted from cell walls of day old etiolated seedlings of wt and . proteins were separated by electrophoresis . a band around kda in which was previously identified was clearly visible after _METHOD_ blue staining in the wt extract but appeared much fainter in the extract . maldi tof _METHOD_ analysis after tryptic digestion of the kda band from wt displayed four peptides specific for allowing its identification one major peptide and three minor ones . in only a small peak corresponding to the major peptide was detected in the kda band suggesting that this band also contained . no other protein could be identified in the kda band . even though maldi tof _METHOD_ was not quantitative combined _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and maldi tof _METHOD_ analyses indicated that the amount of was lower in in comparison to wt . altogether these experiments have confirmed the strong reduction of the level of accumulation of gene products in both at the transcript and protein levels . furthermore these results have demonstrated that the selected genomic region carrying the native regulatory sequences was sufficient to rescue the wt _PROTEIN_ level in and that the use of these genetic lines was relevant for the following phenotyping studies . to characterize the spatio temporal _PROTEIN_ pattern of in situ rna hybridization was performed on serial sections from young etiolated seedlings . the sense probe used as a negative control displayed no significant background on wt seedling cross sections . the natural brown color observed on seed coats in all samples did not correspond to ish labeling . by comparison the subsequent serial section hybridized with the antisense probe displayed an intense purple signal restricted to the epidermis of both the hypocotyl and to a lesser extent the cotyledons . cross section of the seedlings at the same developmental stage did not show such a labeling with the as probe in agreement with the rt qpcr data . the epidermal hybridization signal was retrieved in the epidermis from aerial organs of the complemented line . interestingly the ish performed with the as probe on a longitudinal section of wt etiolated seedlings clearly illustrated the restriction of the _PROTEIN_ to epidermal cell of aerial organs which are covered by a cuticle and the absence of such an _PROTEIN_ in the cuticle deprived radicle . _PROTEIN_ is restricted to epidermal cells of cuticle containing hypocotyl and cotyledons from etiolated seedlings . ish was performed with antisense and sense probes on h old serial cross sections and h old etiolated seedling longitudinal sections of wt and one complemented line . the s probe allowed showing the low hybridization background level within the etiolated seedling tissues and in the endosperm and to visualize the natural brown color of the seed coat . scale bars . like most nsltps carries a predicted n terminal signal peptide of amino acids in length most likely directing to the secretory pathway _PROTEIN_ . the mature kda protein accumulated in the cell wall proteome of dark grown hypocotyls in agreement with the assumed localization of nsltps . in order to confirm its sub cellular localization in vivo fused to the _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was transiently produced in nicotiana benthamiana leaves . the _METHOD_ is characterized by its low pka especially well _PROTEIN_ to _METHOD_ emission in various cell compartments including at the acidic ph of the cell wall compartment _PROTEIN_ . _METHOD_ is dually targeted to the cell wall and the _LOCATION_ . the fusion protein _METHOD_ displayed in was produced together with the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ marker _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in nicotiana benthamiana leaves . detached leaves were observed under hypotonic or hypertonic conditions . the tag _METHOD_ _METHOD_ signal is false colored in magenta in the left column . the pm and the _LOCATION_ markers _METHOD_ are false colored in green in the second column and the merge is presented in white in the right column . note that under plasmolysis the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ in the cell wall is excluded from the pm _METHOD_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and that the additional co localization of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ with the chlorophyll auto _METHOD_ indicates its _LOCATION_ localization . scale bars . a specific _METHOD_ _METHOD_ signal was observed at the cell periphery but was difficult to distinguish from the co transformed _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ marker . to overcome this difficulty the detached transformed leaves were plasmolysed in m mannitol allowing the distinction between the peripheral _METHOD_ of the _METHOD_ fusion protein and the retracted _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ thus clearly demonstrating the cell wall localization of _METHOD_ . surprisingly we also observed in the same cells a strong additional _METHOD_ signal of _METHOD_ that co localized with the chlorophyll auto _METHOD_ both in hypotonic and hypertonic conditions . in addition fused to the _METHOD_ coding sequence was transiently _PROTEIN_ in n. benthamiana leaves . _METHOD_ was strongly visualized in _LOCATION_ thus confirming this unexpected localization . however certainly due to the _METHOD_ instability in the cell wall acidic compartment _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was not detected in cell wall contrary to that of _METHOD_ . altogether these results showed that had an original dual localization to the cell wall and the _LOCATION_ . to further clarify the mechanism of transport to the _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ was produced in n. benthamiana leaves in the presence of brefeldin a a drug used to prevent the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ to _LOCATION_ trafficking _PROTEIN_ . in presence of bfa the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was strictly restricted to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ hybrid and bfa compartments . it co localized with the sp _METHOD_ hdel marker of the _LOCATION_ compartment suggesting that _METHOD_ was redistributed in the oversized _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ modified structures as previously described . in the control experiment without bfa _METHOD_ was still observed in the cell wall and in _LOCATION_ . in presence of bfa _METHOD_ was no longer localized to the cell wall and to _LOCATION_ suggesting that needed to go through the _LOCATION_ apparatus to reach these two compartments . therefore it was assumed that the full length pre protein was first targeted to the secretory pathway thanks to its signal peptide prior to be sorted to both the cell wall and _LOCATION_ . the secretory pathway is involved in both cell wall and _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ localization . the _METHOD_ fusion protein was produced together with the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ marker sp _METHOD_ hdel in n. benthamiana leaves which were subjected to brefeldin a treatment . the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ signal is false colored in magenta in . the bright field is displayed to visualize the cell morphology . _LOCATION_ marker and chlorophyll auto _METHOD_ are false colored in green and the merge is presented in white in the right column . note that in presence of bfa _METHOD_ _METHOD_ is restricted to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ hybrid and bfa compartments . scale bars . according to the putative function of nsltps and the above demonstrated _PROTEIN_ profile of restricted to the aerial organ epidermal cells we have performed cuticle dedicated phenotyping experiments . given that a crucial function of the cuticle is its role as a primary barrier to water loss the cuticle permeability was determined in day old etiolated seedlings of wt and seedlings . at this developmental stage following _PROTEIN_ peak has been shown to be strongly accumulated in etiolated hypocotyl cell walls by previous proteomic studies . the water loss rate of the etiolated seedlings was faster in than in wt following exit from the in vitro conditions operated in order to mimic a desiccation stress by quickly reducing the in vitro water saturated atmosphere . the water loss rates of the and complemented lines were slightly slower than the wt one . a link was found between relative transcript level and the water loss rate the higher the transcript level is the more the seedlings resist to water loss . to ensure that the observed weight differences were due to water loss the dry _METHOD_ of the seedlings of the different genotypes was measured . no significant difference was detected between them . the observed faster desiccation in etiolated seedlings could be visualized after exit from in vitro conditions . although both the wt and hypocotyls displayed similar diameters at the time they were put in normal atmospheric conditions a clear shrinkage quickly appeared in hypocotyls whereas the wt ones resisted better to dehydration during the time course of experiments . these observations were confirmed by biometrical data showing that hypocotyl diameters became significantly smaller than the wt ones a few minutes after their transfer to normal atmospheric conditions . etiolated seedlings show increased water loss and toluidine blue permeability . water loss kinetics of wt and complemented lines _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were performed at . points represent mean values _PROTEIN_ . significant differences from wt were assessed by a wilcoxon rank sum test . dry _METHOD_ was measured after days at . no significant differences between the different lines were assessed using a wilcoxon rank sum test arabidopsis thaliana etiolated seedlings from day old wt and were imaged along a min kinetics following exit from the in vitro conditions . hypocotyls displayed a gradually shrinkage whereas wt hypocotyls resisted better to the induced desiccation . hypocotyl diameters were measured using the imagej software . the results were analyzed by _PROTEIN_ and tukey _PROTEIN_ test using r software . different letters indicate significant differences at p value < . permeability of etiolated hypocotyls was examined using the tb staining test . tb uptake was quantified spectrophotometrically at nm . results are presented as mean values sd . significant differences from wt were assessed by a student s t test . moreover non functional cuticle often showed an increased permeability to water soluble molecules that can be monitored with toluidine blue hydrophilic dye uptake . the hypocotyls showed an intense tb coloration as compared to those of the wt and of the two selected complemented lines which remained mostly white . toluidine blue was extracted for quantification from stained aerial organs . significant to fold higher stain intensity was revealed for seedlings as compared to wt and complemented lines in agreement with the macroscopic observations . in order to determine if this permeability phenotype was linked to defects in the cuticle the composition and content of the cuticular waxes and cutin polymer were determined by gc _METHOD_ using day old etiolated hypocotyls . to our knowledge no work has yet reported the cuticle composition of dark grown seedlings . therefore the cuticle lipid profiles obtained were compared to those of light grown a. thaliana _METHOD_ and leaves _PROTEIN_ . the wax profile of etiolated hypocotyls was dominated by _PROTEIN_ and alkanes like in leaves but also contained substantial amounts of very long chain fatty acids with less than _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and very long chain fatty alcohols with less than _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . such compounds were found as very minor components of a. thaliana leaf and stem waxes which usually contained similar compounds but with more than _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . moreover a. thaliana _METHOD_ were characterized by high amounts of _PROTEIN_ ketone and secondary alcohols which were not detected in hypocotyls . the cutin polymer of etiolated hypocotyls was dominated by dicarboxylic acid as in leaves and _METHOD_ but also contained high amounts of polyhydroxy fatty acids . in addition very long chain fatty acids with more than _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were detected . nevertheless the waxes and cutin polymer composition and content of wt and presented only slight differences . the waxes profile of was characterized by very minor increases in the amounts of fatty acids and _PROTEIN_ and fatty alcohols while the major alkanes _PROTEIN_ were not significantly _PROTEIN_ . more interestingly at the cutin level was characterized by a one third increase of the major component when compared to wt . these analyses therefore suggested that alterations in the cutin polymer rather than in the cuticular waxes could be related to the observed increased permeability . and wt etiolated hypocotyls have very similar cuticle composition and content . cuticular waxes and cutin monomers were quantified by gc _METHOD_ . the different aliphatic compounds sorted into individual chain length are presented . mean values are shown in of fresh weight sd . x stands for the sum of all unsaturated fatty acids . significant differences were assessed by a student s t test . to clarify which alteration in the cuticle and/or cell wall could result in the permeability phenotype of the epidermal cell surface and ultra structure of etiolated hypocotyls were investigated by electron microscopy techniques . environmental scanning electron microscopy was used to have an overview of the hypocotyl surface under close to native conditions . esem was indeed particularly _PROTEIN_ to the observation of the delicate hypocotyls because no fixation of the samples was required thus preventing/limiting dehydration effect . while wt hypocotyls showed extremely elongated epidermal cells evenly aligned the architecture of the epidermal cells displayed pronounced modifications both in the shape and cell organization leading to some points of disruption along their surface . this collapsed phenotype was observed from to days post germination for whereas a wt phenotype was repeatedly observed for the three complemented lines . whether these different phenotypes actually corresponded to the native state of the hypocotyls or were accentuated by the vacuum during esem they clearly illustrated an impaired hypocotyl cell surface in . etiolated hypocotyls of show dramatic surface and cuticle cell wall interface defects . hypocotyls from day old wt and etiolated seedlings were imaged using esem osmium tetroxide lipophilic staining at the transmission electron microscopy level and _PROTEIN_ cell wall polysaccharide staining at the tem level . note the dramatic perturbation of the hypocotyl surface imaged by environmental scanning electron microscopy . legend cuticle cytoplasm cell wall cuticle cell wall detachment zone . the ultra structure of both epidermis periclinal cell wall and cuticle was observed by transmission electron microscopy using the osmium tetroxide lipophilic staining and the _PROTEIN_ polysaccharide staining . a typical nm _PROTEIN_ electron dense layer corresponding to the cuticle was observed on the outer part covering the periclinal cell wall in hypocotyl cross sections from both wt and . however the cuticle was clearly no longer sealed to the cell wall at several points especially at the junction zone between two cells thus delineated detachment zones between the cuticle and the underlying periclinal cell wall . on the contrary the wt cuticle consistently appeared attached to the cell wall . while the _PROTEIN_ strongly stained both the wt and the epidermis cell walls the dz were lightly and specifically stained by _PROTEIN_ but not by osmium tetroxide indicating that they were _PROTEIN_ composed of fibrillar cell wall polysaccharides which were pulled up during the cuticle cell wall separation . this repeatedly observed phenotype was reinforced by a quantitative analysis of the dz area stained with _PROTEIN_ at the junction zone between two cells . the ratio of detached cuticle length normalized relatively to the length of outer periclinal cell wall was significantly higher in than in wt . furthermore light microscopy observation of cross sections confirmed the remarkable impaired morphology of hypocotyls in which the epidermal cells were particularly collapsed and thereby modified the overall shape of hypocotyls . by performing correlated lm and tem _PROTEIN_ polysaccharide staining it was shown that the dz were distributed along the hypocotyl surface and were indeed made of empty space with little cell wall material especially at the position covering the epidermal radial cell wall . altogether these results have demonstrated marked ultra structural alterations on the epidermal surface of the etiolated hypocotyls suggesting a role for at the cuticle cell wall interface . correlated light microscopy and tem observations of day old etiolated hypocotyls of wt and . semi thin cross sections of wt and of were stained with tb for lm observations and ultra thin serial sections were _PROTEIN_ labeled for tem observations . the frames indicate the magnified zones . note the overall shrinkage of hypocotyl although no particular phenotype was observable at the cuticle cell wall interface at the correlated high magnification of lm and low magnification of tem respectively . in the higher tem magnification allowed the visualization of the _PROTEIN_ reactive cell wall defibrillated material at the detachment zone located between the cuticle and the cell wall . legend cuticle cytoplasm cell wall cuticle cell wall detachment zone _LOCATION_ .
