during plant reproduction the central cell of the female gametophyte becomes fertilized to produce the endosperm a storage tissue that nourishes the developing embryo within the seed . the molecular _METHOD_ controlling the specification and differentiation of the central cell are poorly understood . we identified a female gametophyte mutant in arabidopsis thaliana _PROTEIN_ that is affected in central cell development . in _PROTEIN_ female gametophytes the central cell 's nucleolus and _LOCATION_ fail to mature properly . in addition endosperm development is not initiated after fertilization of _PROTEIN_ female gametophytes . _PROTEIN_ contains a t dna insertion in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ is a member of the mads box family of genes that likely encode transcription _PROTEIN_ . an _PROTEIN_ green _METHOD_ protein fusion protein is localized to the _LOCATION_ . within the ovule and seed _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ exclusively in the central cell and uncellularized endosperm . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is also detected in roots leaves floral _METHOD_ anthers and young flowers by real time rt pcr . _PROTEIN_ is required for the _PROTEIN_ of two central cell _PROTEIN_ genes demeter and _PROTEIN_ but not for a third central cell _PROTEIN_ gene _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . together these data suggest that _PROTEIN_ functions as a transcription _PROTEIN_ within the central cell gene regulatory network and controls the _PROTEIN_ of downstream genes required for central cell development and function .
we previously identified a large collection of female gametophyte mutants using the criteria of segregation distortion and reduced seed set . one of these mutants _PROTEIN_ is described here . as summarized in table _PROTEIN_ exhibited segregation distortion in self crosses suggesting that the gametophyte generation is affected . to determine whether the _PROTEIN_ mutation affects the female gametophyte we crossed _PROTEIN_ females with wild type males and scored the number of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ progeny . as shown in table transmission of the _PROTEIN_ mutation was significantly reduced compared with that of the wild type allele . in addition siliques resulting from this cross exhibited reduced seed set . these observations indicate that _PROTEIN_ affects the female gametophyte . segregation of the _PROTEIN_ mutation to determine whether the _PROTEIN_ mutation also affects the male gametophyte we crossed _PROTEIN_ males with wild type females and scored the number of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ progeny . as shown in table transmission of the _PROTEIN_ mutation through the male gametophyte was not significantly different from that of the wild type allele indicating that the male gametophyte is not affected . as shown in table the penetrance of the _PROTEIN_ mutation is in the female gametophyte . as a consequence we were not able to isolate homozygous mutants and thus were not able to evaluate whether this mutation affects the sporophyte generation . to determine whether _PROTEIN_ affects megagametogenesis we analyzed female gametophytes at the terminal developmental stage _PROTEIN_ using confocal laser scanning microscopy _PROTEIN_ . we emasculated flowers at stage waited h and fixed ovule tissue for confocal analysis . wild type female gametophytes at this stage have one egg cell one central cell and two synergid cells the three antipodal cells undergo cell death during the transition from stage _PROTEIN_ to _PROTEIN_ . the _LOCATION_ and nucleolus of the central cell are larger than those of the other cells as a result of fusion of the two _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ during central cell development . in _PROTEIN_ female gametophytes all four cells were present and the egg cell and synergid cells appeared indistinguishable from those of the wild type . by contrast the central cell in _PROTEIN_ female gametophytes exhibited two defects the nucleolus and _LOCATION_ both were smaller than those of the wild type . we analyzed female gametophytes at earlier developmental stages to determine why the nucleolus and _LOCATION_ are small in _PROTEIN_ central cells . we first analyzed these structures in the wild type . the central cell is first formed during stage _PROTEIN_ . during this stage the central cell contains the two _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ that fuse to form a single _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and a large _LOCATION_ that occupies most of the volume of this cell . the central cell 's nucleolus is relatively small just after fusion _PROTEIN_ and enlarges as the female gametophyte matures _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ until it reaches a diameter of at the terminal developmental stage _PROTEIN_ . during these stages the _LOCATION_ continues to occupy most of the volume of the central cell . to analyze the maturation of the central cell 's nucleolus and _LOCATION_ in _PROTEIN_ we used _PROTEIN_ to observe the female gametophytes within _PROTEIN_ pistils from flower stage which contain female gametophytes at stages _PROTEIN_ to _PROTEIN_ . female gametophytes at stages _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ exhibited no phenotypic variation indicating that migration and fusion of the _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ occur normally in _PROTEIN_ female gametophytes . by contrast two distinct populations of female gametophytes were observed at stage _PROTEIN_ . one population was indistinguishable from the wild type in all features including the sizes of the central cell 's _LOCATION_ and nucleolus . in the second population the central cell 's _LOCATION_ and nucleolus had reduced size . together these data indicate that the phenotype conferred by _PROTEIN_ first becomes apparent soon after fusion of the _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ and includes defects in _LOCATION_ maturation and the _PROTEIN_ of _LOCATION_ size . in the wild type the central cell becomes fertilized and gives rise to the seed 's endosperm . to determine whether the central cell of _PROTEIN_ female gametophytes is competent to give rise to endosperm we emasculated _PROTEIN_ flowers at stage waited h pollinated with wild type pollen waited h and fixed ovule tissue for confocal analysis . in the wild type at h after pollination one of the synergid cells is degenerated and both the egg cell and the central cell have become fertilized . at this time point the embryo is a single celled zygote and the endosperm consists of four to eight _LOCATION_ . as with the wild type _PROTEIN_ female gametophytes at h after pollination contained a degenerated synergid cell and a single celled zygote . in the wild type egg cells and zygotes are distinguished by several structural features . _PROTEIN_ zygotes exhibited all of these structural features strongly suggesting that _PROTEIN_ egg cells become fertilized . in contrast with the wild type endosperm _LOCATION_ were not present . instead the central cell cavity was filled with highly _METHOD_ material . within the _METHOD_ material the secondary _LOCATION_ and the nucleolus could sometimes be observed but were difficult to distinguish from the surrounding cytoplasm . the absence of endosperm at h after pollination could be attributable to either a failure to form endosperm or a delay in endosperm development . to distinguish between these possibilities we analyzed _PROTEIN_ seeds at h after pollination . in wild type seeds at this time point endosperm consists of > _LOCATION_ and the embryo is at the globular stage . by contrast in _PROTEIN_ siliques of seeds at this time point did not contain endosperm _LOCATION_ . of those seeds lacking endosperm had a zygote like structure in the remaining it could not be determined whether a zygote like structure was present because the embryo sacs were collapsed . this result suggests that the failure to form endosperm is not the result of a delay in endosperm development . the data presented above suggest that the structural changes associated with the central cell are induced by pollination . to explore this possibility further we emasculated stage flowers waited h and fixed ovule tissue for confocal analysis . the _METHOD_ associated with the central cell in fertilized _PROTEIN_ ovules was not observed in _PROTEIN_ female gametophytes of unpollinated pistils at this time point indicating that these structural changes require pollination . together these observations indicate that the central cell in _PROTEIN_ female gametophytes is not competent to give rise to endosperm even when fertilized with wild type pollen . the _PROTEIN_ mutant was identified in a screen of t dna mutagenized lines . to identify the affected gene we used thermal asymmetric interlaced pcr to determine the t dna insertion site in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . the t dna in _PROTEIN_ is inserted into gene _GENE_ . to determine whether the female gametophyte defect is attributable to disruption of _GENE_ we introduced a wild type copy of this gene into the _PROTEIN_ mutant . we generated plants homozygous for both the _PROTEIN_ allele and the rescue construct these plants had full seed set indicating that disruption of _GENE_ is responsible for the female gametophyte defect in _PROTEIN_ mutants . this gene corresponds to _PROTEIN_ which encodes a type i mads domain protein that likely functions as a transcription _PROTEIN_ . to determine the structure of the _PROTEIN_ gene we isolated a cdna clone and compared its sequence with that of the genomic sequence . we also performed and rapid amplification of cdna ends _PROTEIN_ to characterize the and untranslated regions of this gene . as shown in figure _PROTEIN_ comprises a single exon that contains a nucleotide open reading frame . as shown in figure _PROTEIN_ is predicted to encode a protein of amino acids that contains a mads domain near the n terminus of the protein and a his rich region near the c terminus of the protein . the t dna is inserted immediately after the second nucleotide in the predicted open reading frame and is associated with a bp deletion in the coding sequence . this observation suggests that _PROTEIN_ is a null allele . however we were not able to confirm this prediction because we were unable to obtain a homozygous line which precluded the analysis of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ mutants . to characterize the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ during female gametophyte development we analyzed transgenic arabidopsis plants containing a protein fusion construct in which the _PROTEIN_ promoter and the entire _PROTEIN_ coding sequence were fused to green _METHOD_ protein _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . this construct was sufficient to rescue the mutant phenotype in the _PROTEIN_ background suggesting that _PROTEIN_ of this construct mimics that of the endogenous gene . as shown in figure at the terminal developmental stage _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was detected exclusively in the central cell . figure also shows that the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein was localized to the _LOCATION_ consistent with its predicted function as a transcriptional regulator . to determine whether _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ at earlier developmental stages we analyzed _PROTEIN_ in flowers at stage which contain both uncellularized _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and cellularized _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ female gametophytes . within flowers at this stage we detected _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in the _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ before fusion _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . in all cases in which _PROTEIN_ in the _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ was detected the two _LOCATION_ were immediately adjacent to one another . _PROTEIN_ was never observed in _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ that were separated . together these data indicate that _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ specifically in the central cell and that its _PROTEIN_ is first detected in female gametophytes soon after cellularization and before the _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ fuse _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . to determine whether _PROTEIN_ is also _PROTEIN_ in developing seeds we analyzed _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ at to h after pollination . during this period _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was detected exclusively in the endosperm . during endosperm development _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was strongest in young seeds and diminished gradually at progressively older stages _PROTEIN_ was not detected in seeds older than d after pollination . in reciprocal crosses with plants homozygous for the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ construct and the wild type _PROTEIN_ was detected only when the reporter construct was present in the female parent . to analyze _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ elsewhere in the plant we performed real time rt pcr with rna from various organs . consistent with the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in the female gametophyte and endosperm we detected _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in ovaries and young siliques . in addition _PROTEIN_ was detected in roots leaves _METHOD_ young flowers and anthers . our results are consistent with previous studies showing _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in leaves _METHOD_ siliques and anthers . the data presented above suggest that _PROTEIN_ functions as a transcription _PROTEIN_ within the central cell and controls the _PROTEIN_ of downstream genes required for central cell development and function . to test this further we analyzed the _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ central cell _PROTEIN_ genes in _PROTEIN_ mutants . we analyzed the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ in _PROTEIN_ and wild type plants . in wild type female gametophytes _PROTEIN_ gus and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ are _PROTEIN_ in the central cell . as shown in figure the number of female gametophytes _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ gus in _PROTEIN_ plants was that in wild type plants . by contrast the number of female gametophytes _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was approximately equal in _PROTEIN_ and wild type plants . in wild type female gametophytes _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ in both the central cell and the synergid cells . by contrast in _PROTEIN_ plants the reporter was _PROTEIN_ in the synergid cells but not in the central cell in approximately half of the ovules . together these data indicate that _PROTEIN_ is required for the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ but not _PROTEIN_ during central cell development .
arabidopsis thaliana seeds were sterilized in chlorine gas and germinated on plates containing murashige and skoog salts mes sucrose and phytagar . ten day old seedlings were transferred to scott 's redi earth and grown under h illumination . t dna constructs were introduced into agrobacterium tumefaciens strain by electroporation . arabidopsis plants were transformed using a modified floral dip procedure . transformed progeny were selected by germinating surface sterilized seeds on growth medium containing antibiotics . resistant seedlings were transplanted to soil after d of growth . for reciprocal cross analysis _PROTEIN_ plants were crossed with wild type plants as outlined in table . seeds were germinated on growth medium containing kanamycin and the number of resistant and sensitive plants was scored . resistant and sensitive plants were scored as genotypes _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ respectively . statistical analyses of these data were performed using the test . for self cross analysis _PROTEIN_ plants were allowed to self pollinate progeny seeds were collected and the number of resistant and sensitive progeny was scored . resistant progeny from the self cross could be either heterozygous or homozygous for the _PROTEIN_ t dna insertion . to distinguish between these possibilities resistant plants were grown and seed set was scored all resistant plants exhibited seed set indicating that they were heterozygous . statistical analyses of these data were performed using the test . _PROTEIN_ of ovules and seeds was performed as described previously with the modification that we used a zeiss _PROTEIN_ microscope . measurements of nucleoli diameter were obtained using the zeiss lsm software package . tissue from plants containing _METHOD_ constructs was analyzed using a zeiss _PROTEIN_ confocal microscope . _METHOD_ was excited with an argon laser at a wavelength of nm and emission was detected between and nm . for analysis of the terminal developmental stage we emasculated flowers at stage waited h removed the flowers from the plants removed the sepals _PROTEIN_ and stamens and dissected off the carpel walls using a gauge syringe needle . the pistils were then mounted on a slide in murashige and skoog salts ph for _PROTEIN_ analysis . for analysis of different developmental stages we used flowers of the appropriate stage and processed them as described above . the _PROTEIN_ mutant was isolated in a screen of t dna mutagenized lines generated with the vector . we used thermal asymmetric interlaced pcr to identify the sequences flanking the t dna . we used primers oligo and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ to characterize the t dna insertion of the left border and primers _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ to characterize the t dna insertion of the right border . the pcr products from these reactions were then sequenced to determine the nature of the insertion site . the t dna right border inserts between the first and second nucleotides of the open reading frame and faces the region of the gene . the t dna left border inserts after the seventh nucleotide of the open reading frame and faces the region of the gene . molecular complementation was performed using a bp dna fragment containing the _PROTEIN_ genomic coding sequence along with bp of sequence upstream of the translational start codon and bp of sequence downstream of the stop codon . this dna fragment was amplified by pcr using the primers _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and cloned into the topo ii pcr cloning vector to generate clone _PROTEIN_ . the insert was released from clone _PROTEIN_ with bamhi and xhoi and the fragment was subcloned into at bamhi and sali producing clone _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ was introduced into arabidopsis plants heterozygous for the _PROTEIN_ mutation as described above . the t dna contains a marker gene conferring resistance to hygromycin and the t dna contains a marker gene conferring resistance to kanamycin . transformed plants were selected by germinating seeds on growth medium containing hygromycin and kanamycin to select for plants containing both the rescue transgene and the _PROTEIN_ mutation . the presence of the _PROTEIN_ mutation was verified by pcr with primers oligo and _PROTEIN_ . plants heterozygous for the _PROTEIN_ allele and hemizygous for the rescue construct at a single locus were allowed to self cross . the progeny seeds were germinated on growth medium containing kanamycin and the number of resistant and sensitive plants was scored . we observed kanamycin resistant progeny and kanamycin sensitive progeny . plants homozygous for the _PROTEIN_ allele and homozygous for the rescue construct were identified by having progeny seeds that were kanamycin resistant and hygromycin resistant . these plants had seed set indistinguishable from the wild type . to amplify a cdna encompassing the entire open reading frame of _PROTEIN_ we performed rt pcr on rna extracted from pistils harvested from flowers at stage . rna was extracted using the qiagen rneasy kit according to the manufacturer 's instructions . aliquots of rna were reverse transcribed using the retroscript kit according to the manufacturer 's instructions . pcr was performed with primers _PROTEIN_ cdna f and _PROTEIN_ cdna r . the cdna was cloned into the topo ii pcr vector using the topo ta cloning kit resulting in plasmid pcrii _PROTEIN_ . we identified the and untranslated sequences with _PROTEIN_ using the first choice rlm _PROTEIN_ kit . for _PROTEIN_ the gene specific outer primer was outer and the gene specific inner primer was inner . for _PROTEIN_ the gene specific outer primer was _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and the gene specific inner primer was _PROTEIN_ . this analysis showed that _PROTEIN_ contains and untranslated regions of and bp respectively . we used pfam _METHOD_ to identify the mads domain . we used psort to identify the putative _LOCATION_ localization signal . we identified the his rich motif at the c terminus of the protein using prosite . the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion construct has _METHOD_ inserted bp upstream of the stop codon of the _PROTEIN_ gene . as a first step in cloning this gene we generated three pcr products . an upstream fragment was amplified using primers _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . a downstream fragment was amplified using primers _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . the _METHOD_ insert was amplified from pbi _METHOD_ using primers _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ . the _METHOD_ fragment contained the entire _METHOD_ open reading frame excluding the stop codon . the three pcr fragments were gel purified using qiaquick spin columns and then used as the template for a pcr using primers _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ which resulted in a kb fusion product containing _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ sequence . this product was topo cloned and sequenced to verify that no pcr _LOCATION_ existed . the topo clone was then cut with swai and xhoi and inserted into _PROTEIN_ at xhoi/swai to create _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . finally _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was cut with bamhi and xhoi and was subcloned into at bamhi/sali to create _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . this construct was introduced into arabidopsis plants as described above and transformed plants were selected by germinating seeds on growth medium containing hygromycin . the _PROTEIN_ patterns reported in results are derived from the analysis of single insert _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ lines . plants homozygous for both the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ construct and the _PROTEIN_ t dna insert had seed set . tissue was harvested from plants and placed immediately into liquid nitrogen . ovaries were harvested from the oldest stage flower on each plant as well as the next two older flowers from plants harboring the male mutation to prevent self pollination . floral cluster tissue includes the inflorescence meristem and flowers at stages to . silique tissue includes siliques at to d after pollination . leaf tissue includes leaves of to mm . roots were harvested from seedlings at d after germination . floral stem tissue includes internodes from week old plants . rna was extracted from these tissues using the qiagen rneasy kit according to the manufacturer 's instructions . dna contamination was removed from samples using the ambion turbo dna free dnase kit according to the manufacturer 's instructions . after dnase treatment rna samples were repurified using the qiagen rneasy kit according to the manufacturer 's instructions . aliquots of rna were reverse transcribed using the retroscript kit according to the manufacturer 's instructions . for real time rt pcr pcr was performed using the roche faststart dna master sybr green i master mix in a volume of on a roche lightcycler system . the pcr mixture consisted of of cdna primers and master mix . in every real time rt pcr run was used as an internal control to normalize for variation in the amount of cdna template . the pcr primers used were _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . the pcr program consisted of a first step of denaturation and taq activation followed by cycles of denaturation annealing and extension . to determine the specificity of the pcr the amplified products were subjected to melt curve analysis using the machine 's standard method . the reported values are averages of four independent trials . we calculated relative _PROTEIN_ levels as follows . we first normalized _PROTEIN_ transcript levels relative to a standard using the formula ct _PROTEIN_ ct . we next calculated an average value for each tissue . anther the tissue with the highest relative _PROTEIN_ was used as the standard for the comparison of _PROTEIN_ levels . we then calculated relative _PROTEIN_ levels using the equation . the _PROTEIN_ gus construct contains kb of promoter and kb of the _PROTEIN_ gene _LOCATION_ fused to gus . the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ construct contains kb of promoter and the entire genomic coding region fused to _METHOD_ . the _METHOD_ reporter construct contains kb of flanking sequence of the gene _GENE_ fused to _METHOD_ in the vector pbi _METHOD_ . to analyze promoter reporter constructs in the _PROTEIN_ mutant background we crossed _PROTEIN_ plants as males with plants homozygous for the reporter construct . to identify plants containing the _PROTEIN_ t dna allele pcr was performed with the primers _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . plants heterozygous for the _PROTEIN_ t dna insertion and hemizygous for the reporter construct were allowed to self cross . progeny from the self cross were then scored for the _PROTEIN_ t dna insertion by pcr as described above . one quarter of these plants should also be homozygous for the reporter construct . to identify these plants we made use of the _PROTEIN_ that all reporter constructs were inserted into vectors conferring kanamycin resistance . offspring containing the _PROTEIN_ t dna allele were then allowed to self cross . seeds from this cross were plated on medium containing kanamycin and the ratio of kanamycin sensitive to kanamycin resistant seedlings was scored . plants that produced kanamycin resistant progeny were determined to be homozygous for the promoter reporter construct . analysis of reporter _PROTEIN_ was performed at stage _PROTEIN_ . flowers were emasculated at stage and pistils were collected at h after emasculation . pistils from plants containing _PROTEIN_ gus were stained for gus activity in a solution containing mm sodium phosphate buffer ph triton x mm potassium ferrocyanide
