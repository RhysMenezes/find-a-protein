sm like proteins play multiple functions in rna metabolism which is essential for biological processes such as stress responses in eukaryotes . the arabidopsis thaliana _PROTEIN_ mutant has a mutation of sm like protein _PROTEIN_ and shows impaired drought and salt stress tolerances . the _PROTEIN_ mutant also showed hypersensitivity to heat stress . _METHOD_ fused _PROTEIN_ was localized in the _LOCATION_ under optimal growth conditions . after heat stress treatment _METHOD_ fused _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was also observed as small cytoplasmic dots in addition to _LOCATION_ localization . whole genome transcriptome analysis revealed that many genes in arabidopsis were drastically changed in response to heat stress . more heat responsive genes were highly _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ mutant at both and h after heat stress treatment . additionally intron retained and capped transcripts accumulated in the _PROTEIN_ mutant after heat stress treatment . in this study we also identified non arabidopsis genome initiative transcripts that were _PROTEIN_ from unannotated regions . most of these transcripts were antisense transcripts and many capped non _PROTEIN_ transcripts accumulated in the _PROTEIN_ mutant during heat stress treatment . these results indicated that _PROTEIN_ functions to degrade aberrant transcripts through appropriate mrna splicing and decapping and precise rna metabolic machinery is required for heat stress tolerance .
the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ mutant was originally isolated as a hypersensitive mutant to salt and drought . to investigate the relationship between _PROTEIN_ and heat stress we conducted heat tolerance assays using the _PROTEIN_ mutant . the wild type and _PROTEIN_ mutant were grown on agar plates at for days and then exposed at various heat temperatures for min before being returned to . we photographed the plants phenotypes after days of recovery . seedling growth of the _PROTEIN_ mutant was inhibited by heat stress at and began to die at a temperature higher than . this heat stress tolerance of the _PROTEIN_ mutant was weaker than that of the wild type . we then measured the chlorophyll content of the _PROTEIN_ mutant after heat stress treatment because heat stress bleaches the chlorophyll pigment of plants green tissues . consistent with the plant growth and survival rate results the chlorophyll content of the _PROTEIN_ mutant was reduced compared with the wild type . this impaired thermotolerance of the _PROTEIN_ mutant was complemented by introducing the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ construct which restored wild type levels of thermotolerance . these results indicated that _PROTEIN_ is required for heat stress tolerance . thermotolerance of the _PROTEIN_ mutant after heat stress treatment . photographs of wild type and _PROTEIN_ mutants after heat stress treatment . the survival rate and chlorophyll content of heat treated wild type and _PROTEIN_ mutant after heat stress at various temperatures . five day old seedlings of the wild type and _PROTEIN_ mutant were subjected to various temperatures for min and then returned to under the light and photographs survival rate and chlorophyll content were obtained after days of growth . the values are means _PROTEIN_ of the result from five plates of individual lines . to examine how _PROTEIN_ contributes to heat stress tolerance we examined _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ during heat stress . although heat responsive marker genes _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were upregulated by heat stress _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ did not change significantly during heat stress . we then examined _PROTEIN_ protein levels using transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein driven by the _PROTEIN_ promoter . this _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ construct complemented the phenotype of the _PROTEIN_ suggesting that the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein functions like the native _PROTEIN_ protein in vivo . anti _METHOD_ antibodies recognized a single protein band of kda and the level of the detected _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein remained constant during heat stress . furthermore we examined the intracellular localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein because a subset of sm like proteins in arabidopsis _METHOD_ cytoplasmic foci in response to stress . _METHOD_ _METHOD_ in _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgenic plants was _PROTEIN_ observed in the _LOCATION_ under optimal growth conditions . after heat stress treatment the _LOCATION_ localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ did not change . however _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was also observed as small cytoplasmic dots . by contrast _METHOD_ _METHOD_ in _METHOD_ transgenic plants was observed in both the cytoplasm and the _LOCATION_ before and after heat stress . these results indicated that the _PROTEIN_ protein _PROTEIN_ functions in _LOCATION_ but the distribution of a fraction of it is dynamically changed in response to heat stress similar to and _PROTEIN_ . transcripts protein levels and subcellular protein localization of _PROTEIN_ during heat stress . _PROTEIN_ patterns of _PROTEIN_ and heat responsive marker genes _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ during heat stress in wild type plants . _PROTEIN_ was used as an internal control . _PROTEIN_ patterns of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein during heat stress . transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein driven by the _PROTEIN_ promoter were generated in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . this _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ construct complimented the phenotype of the _PROTEIN_ mutant . twenty _METHOD_ of total protein was loaded in each lane and immunologically detected using an anti _METHOD_ antibody . _METHOD_ stained portion _METHOD_ of gel is shown as a loading control . day old seedlings were incubated at for and h and total mrna and protein were extracted . confocal microscope images

for h. green and red _METHOD_ indicate the _METHOD_ signal and _METHOD_ from the chloroplast respectively . white arrows indicate cytoplasmic dots of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . bars whereas closed up bar . to reveal the global transcription profiles regulated by _PROTEIN_ we carried out whole genome transcriptome analysis of the _PROTEIN_ mutant using strand specific tiling arrays . under the optimal growth conditions there were upregulated and downregulated _PROTEIN_ genes in the _PROTEIN_ mutant compared with _PROTEIN_ code genes _PROTEIN_ in the wild type . in contrast and upregulated and and downregulated _PROTEIN_ code genes in the _PROTEIN_ mutant were identified compared with _PROTEIN_ code genes _PROTEIN_ in the wild type at and h after heat stress treatment respectively . during heat stress there were more up and downregulated _PROTEIN_ code genes at h after heat stress treatment than at h. this result was probably because the _PROTEIN_ mutant is hypersensitive to heat stress . additionally upregulated and downregulated _PROTEIN_ code genes overlapped among the upregulated and downregulated _PROTEIN_ code genes during heat stress treatment . interestingly many genes related to heat stress such as _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were included among the upregulated _PROTEIN_ genes but not the downregulated _PROTEIN_ genes after heat stress treatment despite the _PROTEIN_ mutant showing a weak phenotype for heat tolerance . arabidopsis genome initiative _PROTEIN_ genes and non _PROTEIN_ transcriptional units that are differentially _PROTEIN_ between the wild type and

indicate the signal intensity of the probes . unspliced mrna precursors accumulated in the _PROTEIN_ mutant _PROTEIN_ . therefore we focused on the _PROTEIN_ of genes related to heat stress and whether aberrant splicing occurred in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . we found that strong _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ which encodes a heat shock transcription _PROTEIN_ could be observed in the intron region on the tiling array in the _PROTEIN_ mutant but not in the wild type at h after heat stress treatment . to assess intron _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in the tiling array we used rt pcr analysis . unspliced _PROTEIN_ transcripts were detected in the _PROTEIN_ mutant after heat stress treatment and the generated band was stronger than in the wild type . in contrast to the unspliced transcripts mature _PROTEIN_ transcripts in _PROTEIN_ mutant were reduced compared with the wild type during heat stress treatment . _PROTEIN_ is a key transcription _PROTEIN_ for heat stress tolerance . additionally we found aberrant splicing of _PROTEIN_ which encodes a _PROTEIN_ in the _PROTEIN_ mutant during heat stress treatment . therefore there aberrant splicing in the _PROTEIN_ mutant could be _PROTEIN_ as one of the causes reducing heat stress tolerance . detection of transcripts improperly spliced in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . example of the impaired splicing of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in the _PROTEIN_

seedlings were incubated at for and h. _PROTEIN_ and vsc are involved in rna decapping and this event is required before rna degradation _PROTEIN_ . in addition the complex also contributes to rna decapping _PROTEIN_ . target genes of _PROTEIN_ and vsc are reported as _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . to test whether these genes are also target genes of _PROTEIN_ we checked _PROTEIN_ levels of these genes . tiling array and rt pcr analyses revealed _PROTEIN_ levels of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in the _PROTEIN_ mutant were higher compared with the wild type . in the case of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ intron retaining transcripts were also observed in the _PROTEIN_ mutant during heat stress treatment . to reveal whether _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ transcripts in the _PROTEIN_ mutant retain their cap we performed _PROTEIN_ pcr using a generacer kit which is an rna ligase mediated _PROTEIN_ method . ligation products were not detected without tap treatment as negative control . in the tap treatments significant _PROTEIN_ products for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were detected in the _PROTEIN_ mutant whereas none were detected in the wild type . by contrast _PROTEIN_ products for _PROTEIN_ were detected at similar levels between the wild type and the _PROTEIN_ mutant . this result indicated that _PROTEIN_ targets specific transcripts . interestingly multiple pcr bands for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were detected in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . it is likely that transcripts of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in the _PROTEIN_ mutant might retain the cap on different locations on their terminus . semi quantitative rt pcr analysis for differentially _PROTEIN_ transcripts between the wild type and the _PROTEIN_ mutant during heat stress . _PROTEIN_

performed using transcript specific primers . _PROTEIN_ patterns of antisense non _PROTEIN_ tus that were upregulated in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . first strand cdna synthesis was performed using strand specific primers for transcripts and then pcr was performed using transcript specific primers . pairs of antisense/sense transcripts are as follows and . _PROTEIN_ and were used as internal controls . ten day old seedlings were incubated at for and h. the fold change values were calculated from transcriptional _PROTEIN_ intensities on tiling array data . detection of capped transcripts abnormally accumulated in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . _PROTEIN_ pcr analysis of _PROTEIN_ code genes intergenic non _PROTEIN_ tus and antisense type of non _PROTEIN_ tus . capped transcripts were examined by rna ligase mediated _PROTEIN_ . total rna was incubated with calf intestinal phosphatase to remove the phosphates and an rna _PROTEIN_ was ligated to the end of the transcript after a decapping reaction by tobacco acid pyrophosphatase treatment . and indicate with and without tap treatments respectively . after the rt reaction using oligo primers the first pcr was performed using an rna _PROTEIN_ and transcript specific primer sets and then nested pcr was performed using a nested rna _PROTEIN_ and first transcript specific primer sets . tap indicates a negative control for _PROTEIN_ pcr . total rna was extracted from heat treated samples . in this study we identified non _PROTEIN_ tus that were not registered in the arabidopsis information resource . among them non _PROTEIN_ tus were categorized as antisense transcripts . eighty four upregulated and downregulated non _PROTEIN_ tus were identified in the _PROTEIN_ mutant compared with non _PROTEIN_ tus _PROTEIN_ in the wild type under both optimal growth conditions and heat stress conditions . during heat stress treatment and upregulated and nine and three downregulated non _PROTEIN_ tus in the _PROTEIN_ mutant were identified compared with non _PROTEIN_ tus _PROTEIN_ in the wild type at and h after heat stress treatment respectively . among the upregulated non _PROTEIN_ tus in the _PROTEIN_ mutant non _PROTEIN_ tus were defined as antisense transcripts whereas were _PROTEIN_ from intergenic regions . contrastingly among the downregulated non _PROTEIN_ tus in _PROTEIN_ and were categorized as antisense and intergenic types respectively . indeed the _PROTEIN_ of and were detected using rt pcr analysis and their _PROTEIN_ intensities in the _PROTEIN_ mutant tended to be stronger than those in the wild type at h after heat stress treatment which was consistent with the tiling array data . additionally we also confirmed antisense transcripts that were _PROTEIN_ on the opposite strand to _PROTEIN_ code genes using strand specific rt pcr analysis . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ encode a pentatricopeptide repeat _PROTEIN_ superfamily protein myb like dna binding bromodomain containing protein and non ltr retrotransposon family respectively and these show low _PROTEIN_ levels in developmental stages and under various stress treatments _PROTEIN_ . by contrast _PROTEIN_ of and increased during heat stress and their _PROTEIN_ levels in _PROTEIN_ were stronger than in the wild type . these _PROTEIN_ patterns were similar to those observed in the tiling array analysis . these results indicated that non _PROTEIN_ tus identified by the strand specific tiling array were truly _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis . to test whether the highly _PROTEIN_ non _PROTEIN_ tus in _PROTEIN_ mutant retained their caps as well as _PROTEIN_ genes we examined cap accumulation using a generacer kit . in case of intergenic non _PROTEIN_ tus the _PROTEIN_ product for was detected in only the _PROTEIN_ mutant . although pcr products for and were detected in both the wild type and the _PROTEIN_ mutant their multiple bands were observed only in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . antisense non _PROTEIN_ tus in the _PROTEIN_ mutant showed similar trends to _PROTEIN_ genes and intergenic non _PROTEIN_ tus . these results suggested that capped antisense non _PROTEIN_ tus accumulate in the _PROTEIN_ mutant .
