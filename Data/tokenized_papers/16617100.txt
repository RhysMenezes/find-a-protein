the sorting determinants of glycinin a soybean globulin which mediates protein targeting to the protein storage _LOCATION_ were investigated in maturing soybean cotyledons by transient _PROTEIN_ assays . a c terminal stretch of amino acids of a glycinin group i subunit was sufficient to direct green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ to the psv . this peptide may correspond to a c terminal _LOCATION_ sorting determinant . because functional inhibition of this putative ctvsd of did not block psv sorting of we used the three dimensional structure of to identify candidates for a sequence specific determinant . we found that the sequence downstream of disordered region could direct _METHOD_ to the psv and that ile is critical for sorting . however functional inhibition of the ctvsd combined with the mutation did not abolish the _LOCATION_ sorting of suggesting that has a third sorting determinant in addition to ctvsd and ssvsd . a glycinin group ii subunit lacked a ctvsd but contained a vsd reminiscent of an ssvsd and an additional sorting determinant . we also demonstrate by _PROTEIN_ of dominant negative mutants of small _PROTEIN_ and drug treatment experiments that the trafficking of is _PROTEIN_ vesicle dependent and wortmannin and brefeldin a sensitive .
the last amino acids at the c terminus of a group i subunit are located on the molecular surface . the ctvsds of plant _LOCATION_ proteins are often rich in hydrophobic amino acids and their lengths and sequences are highly variable . therefore we first analyzed whether the c terminal amino acids of are sufficient to direct a reporter protein to the psv . previously we developed a transient _PROTEIN_ assay system using particle bombardment of maturing soybean cotyledons . we used _METHOD_ modified by adding four contiguous gly residues to its c terminus _METHOD_ as a reporter in the characterization of the vsd of conglycinin another major soybean seed storage protein . this c terminal modification of _METHOD_ is essential because the c terminal region of _METHOD_ works weakly as a ctvsd and a stretch of contiguous gly residues was reported to inhibit the function of barley lectin ctvsd . as a control we constructed a gene for a fusion protein that consists of the signal peptide and _METHOD_ and we introduced this plasmid into maturing soybean cotyledon cells by particle bombardment . in the cells _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was detected in the nucleoplasm and/or the _LOCATION_ . this was surprising because in general proteins having no vsds are secreted to intercellular space . when we _PROTEIN_ a fusion protein that consists of the conglycinin signal peptide and _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was detected in the ics . thus we considered that the signal peptide of was not fully functional at the n terminus of _METHOD_ and therefore _METHOD_ might inefficiently penetrate into the _LOCATION_ . previously we determined the three dimensional structure of and demonstrated that six disordered regions exist . among these regions the first is positioned at the n terminus and consists of nine amino acids . we constructed a gene for a fusion protein that consists of the signal peptide and nine n terminal amino acids of fused to _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . both the tobacco chitinase and the barley lectin ctvsds can direct the reporter proteins to the psv _LOCATION_ . _METHOD_ fused to the lectin ctvsd _METHOD_ and monomeric red _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ fused to the chitinase ctvsd _METHOD_ were colocalized in maturing soybean cotyledon cells . therefore _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was coexpressed with _METHOD_ chitinase in maturing soybean cotyledon cells . in cells _PROTEIN_ both _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ chitinase _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was detected in a reticular structure reminiscent of the _LOCATION_ as well as the ics _METHOD_ whereas _METHOD_ chitinase was observed only in the psv . this finding indicates that disordered region of does not have a vsd . when _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was appended to the c terminal amino acids of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was clearly detected in the psv in all cells _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and several small puncta were also detected in some cells _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . the patterns of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ chitinase completely overlapped indicating that the c terminal amino acids of can direct _METHOD_ to the psv . furthermore we appended six gly residues to the c terminus of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and introduced this construct into maturing cotyledon cells because the _LOCATION_ sorting function of ctvsds is blocked by the addition of contiguous gly residues . _METHOD_ was observed in the ics but not in the psv indicating that the c terminal amino acids of work as a ctvsd . we examined whether or not the c terminal amino acids were necessary for the sorting of to the psv . if a truncated glycinin subunit lacking a vsd is _PROTEIN_ in seeds of normal soybean lines it can assemble with endogenous glycinin subunits and is sorted to the psv by the vsd of the endogenous glycinin subunits . thus it is impossible to analyze the sorting ability of truncated glycinin in seeds of normal soybean lines . recently mutant soybean lines lacking glycinin have been developed . previously we analyzed the trafficking of storage proteins to the psv in the seeds of this glycinin null line by immunoelectron microscopy and showed that these cells have a normal transport system to the psv . thus we examined the sorting of fused at its c terminus with _METHOD_ _METHOD_ in maturing cotyledon cells of the glycinin null line _METHOD_ . we anticipated that the fusion of _METHOD_ to the c terminus of would disrupt deposition in the psv because it is essential that ctvsds are located at the c terminus . in most cells in which _METHOD_ was detected it was observed in both the psv and the ics . approximately to of total _METHOD_ in a single cell exists in the ics . these results suggest that although the c terminal amino acids of are necessary for efficient sorting to the psv contains an additional sorting determinant other than the ctvsd one that can contribute some _LOCATION_ sorting function . disordered region is contained within the c terminal amino acids which can work as a vsd . the other disordered regions are prime candidates for a second vsd that would act through interaction with a receptor because they are located on the molecular surface and have flexible structures . the region of corresponding to disordered region of is not disordered . thus we examined whether or not additional vsds exist in disordered regions and . castor bean albumin and ricin have ssvsds located on prolinker regions . characterization of the npirl like motif contained within the ssvsd of sweet potato sporamin in tobacco cells indicated that the ile residue in this motif can be replaced only with the leu residue whereas other residues are comparatively exchangeable . similarly leu in the prolinker region of castor bean albumin is critical for its _LOCATION_ sorting . these reports indicate that an ile or leu residue located on the molecular surface may play an important role in _LOCATION_ sorting . therefore we searched for leu or ile residues located on the molecular surface using the three dimensional structure of . twelve leu or ile residues on the molecular surface were found . however one of these leu which is flanked by residues ala and ile has a buried side chain and therefore is unlikely to interact with a receptor . thus we tested the potential role of the remaining leu and ile residues positioned on the molecular surface as vsds . we also tested the ability of each of the disordered regions to function as a vsd . we used _METHOD_ fused to the signal peptide and disordered region at the n terminus _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ as a reporter to analyze the sorting ability of additional regions . to exclude the possibility that these sequences might function as ctvsds we added six contiguous gly residues to the c terminus of each construct . in most constructs _METHOD_ was observed only in a reticular structure reminiscent of the _LOCATION_ and the ics . however in the case of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ appended to disordered region and two adjacent regions kgglsvikp and ictmrl which correspond to the n and c terminal extensions respectively of disordered region _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ we observed _METHOD_ in the psv as well as the ics and the intracellular reticular structure . furthermore we examined the sorting ability of the isolated svikp sequence _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ disordered region _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and disordered region fused to the ictmr peptide _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . both _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ svikp and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were secreted to the ics whereas the _METHOD_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ ictmr was detected in the psv as well as the ics and the internal reticular structures . interestingly the sorting ability of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ ictmr was almost completely abolished by the replacement of ile in the sequence ictmr with gly _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . thus ile in _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ ictmr is critical for directing _METHOD_ to the psv and this sequence might work as a vsd reminiscent of an ssvsd . next we examined whether or not the mutation of this critical ile residue downstream of disordered region affected the sorting ability of fused at its c terminus with _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . _METHOD_ was observed in both the psv and the ics similar to the case with _METHOD_ . thus the contribution of this putative ssvsd to the _LOCATION_ sorting of is low and yet another vsd in addition to the ctvsd and the ssvsd likely exists in . previously we showed that truncated and subunits of conglycinin and the modified proglycinin can fold correctly when _PROTEIN_ in escherichia coli and that such proteins can fold correctly in transgenic rice and arabidopsis seeds . thus we believe that e. coli _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ can be used to judge whether or not truncated proteins are likely to fold correctly in soybean seed cells . if _METHOD_ and its derivative can fold correctly in the e. coli _PROTEIN_ system we can rule out potential sorting defects arising from the conformational defects that might be induced by fusion with _METHOD_ . first we _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ in e. coli origami . both _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ were _PROTEIN_ in e. coli and were almost completely soluble . to confirm correct folding we then analyzed their self assembly and _METHOD_ arising from _METHOD_ chromophores . extracts produced by sonication were applied to a sephacryl s hr gel filtration column and fractions were analyzed by immunoblotting using anti glycinin serum . the peaks of recombinant _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ were detected in fractions to . under the same conditions purified mature glycinin and proglycinin were eluted at and min respectively . if _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ self assemble into trimers similarly to proglycinin the molecular _METHOD_ of each should be kd . thus the elution times on the gel filtration column indicate that _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ self assembled into trimers . finally we compared the _METHOD_ profiles of the _METHOD_ chromophores of _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ in fraction with that of _METHOD_ . the excitation and emission spectra of fraction containing _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ were almost identical to those of _METHOD_ reported previously . thus _METHOD_ and in _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ folded properly and the fusion proteins self assembled into trimers similarly to proglycinin in e. coli . these results imply that _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ are likely to fold correctly in maturing soybean cotyledon cells in our transient assay . therefore we consider it credible that _METHOD_ was sorted to the psv via a third determinant . previously we determined the three dimensional structure of a group ii subunit and demonstrated that the overall structure of is very similar to that of . however the sequence corresponding to the ctvsd of does not exist in and only a c terminal pro residue is exposed on the molecular surface . nonetheless is correctly sorted to the psv in seeds of the soybean group i and null lines suggesting that has a vsd distinct from a ctvsd . first to confirm this we examined the sorting ability of fused at its c terminus with _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . although the _METHOD_ of _METHOD_ was detected in the psv and the ics we observed _METHOD_ of _METHOD_ only in the psv and not in the ics . next we investigated whether or not the region of that corresponds to disordered region appended to the sequence ictmr of contains a vsd _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . _METHOD_ was detected in the psv as well as in an internal reticular structure reminiscent of the _LOCATION_ . it _METHOD_ that the rate for psv sorting of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ ictmk was slower than that of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ ictmr . this difference in rate might be attributable to the difference in the sequence . furthermore we confirmed that the replacement of the ile residue in _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ ictmk by gly _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ completely abolished sorting to the psv . therefore the sequence downstream of disordered region of contains a vsd reminiscent of an ssvsd . the replacement of the ile residue in the sequence ictmk of _METHOD_ by gly _METHOD_ did not affect the sorting of _METHOD_ to psvs at all suggesting that another vsd exists possibly similar to the third vsd of . drugs such as brefeldin a and wortmannin have been used to analyze trafficking _METHOD_ along the secretory pathway . first we examined the effect of bfa which induces an _LOCATION_ apparatus hybrid organelle in tobacco cultured cells on the sorting of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ . previously arabidopsis xylosyltransferase and rat sialyltransferase fused to _METHOD_ proteins were used as markers for the _LOCATION_ apparatus in tobacco cultured cells and/or leaf epidermal cells . thus to confirm the _LOCATION_ apparatus localization of these fusions in soybean cotyledons we examined the localization of arabidopsis xylosyltransferase fused to _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and rat sialyltransferase fused to _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . as expected both showed spindle like structures which likely correspond to the _LOCATION_ apparatus and completely overlapped each other . thus we used xyl _METHOD_ as a _LOCATION_ apparatus marker in further experiments . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and xyl _METHOD_ were located in psvs and spindle like structures respectively in maturing soybean cotyledon cells cultured in medium without bfa . however in the presence of bfa xyl _METHOD_ showed a reticular pattern consistent with the redistribution of _LOCATION_ protein to the _LOCATION_ upon treatment with bfa as reported previously . however unlike xyl _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ accumulated in globular structures and colocalized with an _LOCATION_ marker _METHOD_ hdel . in the absence of bfa _METHOD_ hdel showed a characteristic _LOCATION_ reticular pattern . _METHOD_ exhibited patterns similar to those of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . these results imply that bfa induces a redistribution of _LOCATION_ proteins to a reticular _LOCATION_ like structure in maturing soybean cotyledon cells as reported previously in tobacco cells . furthermore bfa treatment causes some _LOCATION_ residents to condense into globular structures in which both psv and secreted proteins were localized perhaps corresponding to an exaggerated subdomain in the _LOCATION_ apparatus hybrid organelle . next we examined the effect of wortmannin a phosphatidylinositol kinase and phosphatidylinositol kinase inhibitor . preliminary experiments demonstrated that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ accumulated in punctate structures of various sizes inside maturing cotyledon cells treated with wortmannin . it was reported previously that the pea _LOCATION_ sorting receptor colocalizes with the endogenous tobacco vsr when the heterologous reporter was _PROTEIN_ in tobacco suspension culture cells and that this organelle corresponds to the prevacuolar compartment . thus to examine the punctate structures containing _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ formed by wortmannin treatment we used _METHOD_ fused to arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and xyl _METHOD_ as a prevacuolar compartment marker and a _LOCATION_ apparatus marker respectively . we confirmed that _METHOD_ vsr was detected in punctate structures and was not colocalized with arabidopsis xylosyltransferase fused to yellow _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ _LOCATION_ in maturing soybean cotyledon cells in either the absence or the presence of wortmannin . when _METHOD_ vsr and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were coexpressed in the presence of wortmannin of puncta containing _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were colocalized with _METHOD_ vsr . on the other hand when xyl _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were coexpressed only of the puncta containing _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were colocalized with xyl _METHOD_ . _METHOD_ exhibited patterns similar to those of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . thus we interpret these patterns as evidence that the sorting of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ to the psv and the ics was blocked at several steps between the _LOCATION_ apparatus and the psv and that both of these proteins accumulate predominantly in a prevacuolar compartment in the presence of wortmannin . recently dominant negative mutants of small _PROTEIN_ such as sar/arf/rab have been used to analyze _LOCATION_ traffic in plant cells . we confirmed that mrnas of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are synthesized in maturing arabidopsis seed cells by rt pcr . to examine the effects of arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ dominant negative mutants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plasmids encoding dominant negative mutants and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ were transiently coexpressed in maturing soybean cotyledon cells . we observed no effect of the coexpression of wild type _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ on _LOCATION_ sorting . however upon coexpression of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ displayed a punctal and reticular pattern in all cells indicating that _LOCATION_ sorting was clearly inhibited . furthermore _PROTEIN_ exhibited similar effects . these results indicate that our transient _PROTEIN_ assay can be applied to analyze the effect of dominant negative mutants of small _PROTEIN_ and that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are involved in the _LOCATION_ sorting of to the psv in soybean cotyledon cells .
