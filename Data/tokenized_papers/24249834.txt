glutathione is involved in thiol redox signaling and acts as a major redox buffer against reactive oxygen species helping to _PROTEIN_ a reducing environment in vivo . glutathione reductase _PROTEIN_ catalyzes the reduction of glutathione disulfide into reduced glutathione . the arabidopsis thaliana genome encodes two _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . whereas the _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ is not crucial for plant development we show here that the _LOCATION_ localized _PROTEIN_ is essential for root growth and root apical meristem _PROTEIN_ . we identify a _PROTEIN_ mutant miao that displays strong inhibition of root growth and severe defects in the ram with _PROTEIN_ activity being reduced to . miao accumulates high levels of gssg and exhibits increased glutathione oxidation . the exogenous application of gsh or the thiol reducing agent dtt can rescue the root phenotype of miao demonstrating that the ram defects in miao are triggered by glutathione oxidation . our in silico analysis of public microarray data shows that auxin and glutathione redox signaling generally act independently at the transcriptional level . we propose that glutathione redox status is essential for ram _PROTEIN_ through both auxin/plethora dependent and auxin/plt independent redox signaling pathways .
in an ethyl methanesulfonate mutagenesis screen of arabidopsis columbia we isolated miao a mutant displaying a short primary root . after germination the primary root growth of miao was strongly inhibited but adventitious roots emerged at to d after germination . in vitro grown miao seedlings had dark green cotyledons whereas soil grown miao plants were smaller and dwarfed . all plants from the cross of miao with col exhibited the col phenotype and in the population the miao phenotype segregated at a ratio of indicating that miao corresponded to a single recessive locus . homozygous miao plants were further backcrossed with col to eliminate background mutations . the remarkable root growth inhibition phenotype of miao prompted us to examine its ram architecture . based on the ram boundary where the first cells in the cortex file are typically elongated the modified pseudo schiff propidium iodide _PROTEIN_ staining and nomarski images showed that the ram length and cell number of the cortex cell file of miao were _PROTEIN_ to and respectively compared with col . the ram of miao completely collapsed to dag . in line with the reduced ram length of miao the _PROTEIN_ of cyclin _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ pro gus _PROTEIN_ a reporter for the _PROTEIN_ phase of the cell cycle was restricted to a small number of proximal meristem cells . however the _PROTEIN_ level of _PROTEIN_ gus in the ram of miao was not remarkably altered when considering the _PROTEIN_ length of the ram indicating repressed mitosis and/or enhanced endocycle at the transition from cell proliferation to elongation in the root of miao . we next examined whether the ram defects in miao were associated with changes in quiescent center _PROTEIN_ properties and stem cell formation . after staining starch granules with lugol s solution we observed that starch granules accumulated in the _PROTEIN_ and neighboring distal stem cells indicating the differentiation status of these cells . this observation was further resolved using a modification of mps _PROTEIN_ staining which showed starch granules in both the _PROTEIN_ and dsc in miao . using the _PROTEIN_ identity markers _PROTEIN_ gus and _PROTEIN_ related _PROTEIN_ pro _METHOD_ _METHOD_ we observed that _PROTEIN_ gus _PROTEIN_ was strongly reduced and that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was only slightly reduced in miao indicating a partial loss of _PROTEIN_ identity . we used map based cloning to identify the mutated _PROTEIN_ gene . initial mapping localized _PROTEIN_ to the right arm of chromosome iii between the molecular markers and . subsequent fine scale mapping using pcr based molecular markers narrowed _PROTEIN_ to an kb region between positions and bp in bac . all genes in this region of the miao genome were sequenced and compared with the gene sequences of col . one cytosine to thymine mutation at the nucleotide of the _GENE_ coding region was detected . at the protein level this base change translates to a replacement of ser by phe . annotated by tair as _PROTEIN_ _GENE_ is one of two genes encoding _PROTEIN_ in the arabidopsis genome . _PROTEIN_ belongs to the pyridine nucleotide disulphide oxidoreductase family . _PROTEIN_ contains exons and introns . the full length open reading frame is bp long and encodes a amino acid protein . _PROTEIN_ shows identity to _PROTEIN_ . the conserved domain database reveals that _PROTEIN_ contains one pyridine nucleotide disulphide oxidoreductase domain from amino acid to and one rossmann fold nad binding domain between residues and . in addition the sequence contains a pyridine nucleotide disulphide oxidoreductase domain from residue to where cys and cys can form the active disulfide bonds . homozygous miao plants were transformed with a binary vector containing a bp genomic _PROTEIN_ dna fragment from col which included the bp genomic coding region as well as the bp upstream and bp downstream flanking sequences . this dna fragment rescued the short root and ram defects as well as the dwarf phenotype of miao confirming that the _PROTEIN_ mutation is responsible for the miao phenotype . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ venus and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ gus also completely rescued the miao phenotype hence these constructs were used for further _PROTEIN_ localization . to determine the effect of the _PROTEIN_ mutation on _PROTEIN_ activity we assayed total _PROTEIN_ activity in vivo . total protein was extracted from the whole seedlings of col and miao lines and _PROTEIN_ activities were measured using mm gssg as the substrate and mm nadph as the reducing power . as shown in figure the total _PROTEIN_ activity at and dag _PROTEIN_ to and of that of col respectively in miao extracts . it was previously reported that _PROTEIN_ accounts for to of the total _PROTEIN_ activity in arabidopsis leaf tissue suggesting that the activity of _PROTEIN_ in miao is seriously impaired . histochemical staining of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ gus transgenic plants showed that _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ throughout the whole seedling . strong _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ gus and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ venus _PROTEIN_ was observed in the ram in line with the ram defects and root growth inhibition of the _PROTEIN_ mutant miao . in addition _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ gus was widely _PROTEIN_ in various organs and tissues _PROTEIN_ suggesting that _PROTEIN_ is involved in pleiotropic developmental processes . in contrast with the _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ localization of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is predicted to be a _LOCATION_ protein by tair and predotar . moreover chlorop reveals that the first n terminal amino acids of _PROTEIN_ constitute the _LOCATION_ localization signal . however previous _METHOD_ microscopy studies on transiently transformed soybean suspension cells claimed that _PROTEIN_ could localize to both _LOCATION_ and mitochondria . to further define the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ venus transgenic plants were crossed with either a _LOCATION_ cyan _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ marker line pt cb or a mitochondria _METHOD_ marker line mt cb . pt cb and mt cb marker lines were generated by plant transformation with binary vectors pt cb or mt cb which were constructed by the fusion of the _METHOD_ with the chloroplast targeting signal of the tobacco ribulose bis phosphate _PROTEIN_ small subunit and the mitochondria targeting signal of saccharomyces cerevisiae _PROTEIN_ respectively . the confocal microscopy images revealed that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ venus colocalized with pt cb but not with mt cb in the root and hypocotyl cells demonstrating the _LOCATION_ localization of _PROTEIN_ . in addition our coexpression of _PROTEIN_ venus and pt cb or mt cb in two transient transformation _METHOD_ confirmed the _LOCATION_ localization of _PROTEIN_ . abundant _LOCATION_ in ram were shown by the _LOCATION_ marker pt cb . the high density of _LOCATION_ in the ram probably reflects the high activity of these cells considering that many crucial housekeeping metabolic reactions for example glycolysis and the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway occur in _LOCATION_ . however other subcellular localizations resulting from alternative splicing or translation initiation in different temporal and spatial contexts could not be excluded . to test the importance of the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ to root growth and ram _PROTEIN_ we generated _PROTEIN_ venus by truncating the first amino acids of the n terminal region of _PROTEIN_ which were a predicted _LOCATION_ localization signal . the _LOCATION_ targeting signal from the tobacco rubisco small subunit and the mitochondria targeting signal from s. cerevisiae _PROTEIN_ were inserted into the n terminus of _PROTEIN_ venus giving rise to _PROTEIN_ pt venus and _PROTEIN_ mt venus respectively . these vectors were then transformed into miao plants . for each transformation at least independent lines were identified all showing similar phenotypes . the transformations of both _PROTEIN_ venus and _PROTEIN_ mt venus failed to rescue the root defects but _PROTEIN_ pt venus conferred partial recovery of the root phenotype of miao . the only partial recovery was likely due to the lower _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ pt venus compared with that of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ venus in the ram the result of an unknown mechanism caused by the truncation of bp and/or insertion of bp at the end of _PROTEIN_ . nevertheless our findings demonstrate that _PROTEIN_ is localized to _LOCATION_ and that its _LOCATION_ localization is essential to root growth and ram _PROTEIN_ . given that _PROTEIN_ regulates the gsh gssg ratio by catalyzing the reduction of gssg we measured the gsh gssg ratio in the miao mutant . glutathione and its precursor glutamylcysteine were extracted from whole seedlings of col and miao and quantified by reverse phase hplc . gsh and ec levels were slightly higher in miao . notably miao had a steep increase in gssg . hence the gsh gssg ratios of and d old miao dropped to and respectively of those of col . _PROTEIN_ reduction oxidation sensitive _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was developed as an indicator of glutathione redox status . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ can be excited at and nm in its oxidized and reduced states respectively thus the ratio reflects the glutathione redox status in vivo . to restrict this measurement to _LOCATION_ we fused a chloroplast targeting signal of the tobacco rubisco small subunit to the n terminus of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ giving rise to pt _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . ratiometric imaging showed that in both col and miao treatment with increased the ratio whereas treatment with the thiol reducing agent dtt _PROTEIN_ the ratio . consistent with the lower ratio of gsh gssg in miao a higher ratio was observed with both _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and pt _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ markers in the root tip of miao indicating an oxidized glutathione status . notably in the defective ram of miao glutathione appeared to be more oxidized as indicated by pt _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ than by _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ corroborating the _LOCATION_ localization of _PROTEIN_ . the increased oxidation of glutathione in miao prompted us to test whether exogenous thiol reducing agents were able to rescue the root phenotype . the seedlings of col and miao were germinated and grown on one half strength murashige and skoog _METHOD_ medium supplemented with gsh gssg or dtt . at dag gsh significantly enhanced the root and ram lengths of miao in a dose dependent manner whereas the oxidized form of gsh gssg had no effect on miao roots . moreover treatments of miao with and mm dtt also caused root length to increase by and times and the ram length to increase by and times respectively . these results confirm that the ram defects and root growth inhibition in miao are triggered by glutathione oxidation . glutathione redox status is affected by both the gsh gssg ratio and the total glutathione level . to elucidate the possible genetic interactions between glutathione biosynthesis and reduction we crossed miao with a weak _PROTEIN_ mutant allele _PROTEIN_ which has only to of the glutathione found in the wild type and shows cadmium sensitivity but displays nearly normal seedling development under control conditions . from the generation mutants homozygous for miao but heterozygous for _PROTEIN_ were selected and self pollinated . in the population the phenotypes segregated with of the seedlings exhibiting the miao phenotype and the others showing cotyledon bleaching a characteristic feature of oxidative stress sensitivity . the seedlings with cotyledon bleaching exhibited more severe _PROTEIN_ differentiation and more disorganized columella cell tiering than miao . the development of these seedlings was arrested at dag and the double homozygous plants for both miao and _PROTEIN_ were not found in the next generation . taken together miao _PROTEIN_ double mutants displayed ram defects and postembryonic lethality probably caused by oxidative stress suggesting that the combination of these two _LOCATION_ proteins _PROTEIN_ and ecs plays a critical role in plant development by regulating glutathione redox status . in addition the miao double mutant showed the same phenotype as miao at different development stages and no additive effects were observed . however our glutathione measurement showed that miao had remarkably higher gssg levels and lower gsh gssg ratios than the miao or single mutants . these results together with the known differences in subcellular localization suggest that the functions of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in _METHOD_ of gssg reduction are not redundant . we also observed that gsh content was increased by in the miao seedlings compared with the miao or the seedlings this increase was likely a result of the redox regulation of ecs activity . auxin is well known as a crucial regulator of plant development . in an attempt to disclose the relationship between glutathione dependent redox and auxin signaling we performed a comparative in silico analysis of gene _PROTEIN_ in whole seedlings under bso mediated glutathione oxidation and auxin treatments using publicly available data from arabidopsis seedlings . to select genes that were differentially regulated by bso we used a false discovery rate of q < and a fold change cutoff and identified upregulated and downregulated genes . of the upregulated genes were upregulated under at least one of the conditions of indole acetic acid application . by contrast only three of these genes were upregulated by auxin under three or more conditions of auxin application indicating their robust auxin response . none of the upregulated genes belongs to a classical auxin responsive family . of these genes were upregulated only under extremely high levels of iaa application indicating that this gene group is more closely linked with stress responses than with specific features of auxin signaling . this finding was confirmed by an analysis of the promoter sequences of this group of iaa induced genes whose promoters lacked the auxin responsive element . the w box promoter and dehydration response element _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ binding _PROTEIN_ cis elements were overrepresented in this group of genes which again strongly indicates a link to stress responses . of the genes downregulated by bso were upregulated under at least one selected auxin application condition . of these genes only five could be considered truly robust auxin responsive genes because they were upregulated under at least five of seven selected conditions of auxin application . among the five genes we selected _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ the classic auxin responsive genes for investigating gene _PROTEIN_ in miao by quantitative rt pcr . however miao and col seedlings had similar _PROTEIN_ levels of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . this discrepancy may result from the differences in the extent of gsh oxidation and/or the means by which glutathione oxidation occurs _PROTEIN_ . nevertheless because the node of genes with overlapping _PROTEIN_ under iaa treatment and glutathione oxidation mediated by bso is small we conclude that glutathione dependent redox and auxin signaling act nearly independently in whole seedlings at the transcriptional level . notably one of the plt genes _PROTEIN_ was weakly downregulated after d of treatment with mm bso . plt is a crucial regulator in root development . auxin can induce the _PROTEIN_ of plt conversely plt regulates _PROTEIN_ which stabilizes the auxin gradient by _PROTEIN_ . this prompted us to investigate the potential interaction between glutathione dependent redox signaling and the auxin/plt pathway . we first found that levels of free iaa were slightly but significantly lower in d old miao seedlings than in wild type seedlings . _PROTEIN_ dependent auxin biosynthesis may account for the lower auxin levels in miao as the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in miao seedlings was _PROTEIN_ to and of wild type levels respectively according to our qrt pcr results . by contrast the _PROTEIN_ of several other auxin biosynthesis related genes such as _PROTEIN_ aminotransferase of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ was unchanged in miao . the slightly lower iaa content in miao is different from the strong _PROTEIN_ observed in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ while the auxin level was not significantly affected in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants . these results suggest that severe glutathione oxidation by _PROTEIN_ mutation could trigger a slight _PROTEIN_ in auxin levels and that the combination of ngs and nts dependent redox signaling is necessary for auxin homeostasis . the auxin maximum indicated by gus and _METHOD_ in _PROTEIN_ was considerably lower in miao than in col . moreover the auxin maximum in miao was localized to the first tier of columella cells rather than to the _PROTEIN_ as observed in col suggesting that the auxin response and/or gradient in the stem cell niche was strongly perturbed . this auxin perturbation may have been responsible for the alteration of _PROTEIN_ differentiation and the partial loss of _PROTEIN_ identity . _PROTEIN_ mediated _PROTEIN_ establishes and substantiates auxin gradients thereby regulating root patterning and growth . the _PROTEIN_ levels of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were severely reduced in the ram of miao . lower _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ gus _PROTEIN_ gus and _PROTEIN_ gus was also observed in miao . the qrt pcr results confirmed that the mrna levels of these _PROTEIN_ in the root tips of miao were _PROTEIN_ . these findings indicate that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is under transcriptional regulation by glutathione oxidation . our results are in agreement with the previously observed reductions in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ following application of the glutathione biosynthesis inhibitor bso . the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ was estimated by investigating the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ marker lines . in the col background the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was high in the stem cell niche reached an intermediate level in rapidly dividing cells and was low in the elongated cells consistent with previous observations . the overall _PROTEIN_ levels of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were _PROTEIN_ in the miao roots and the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ domains were restricted to the stem cell niche the columella and the proximate meristem cells corresponding to the reduced ram of miao . the qrt pcr results indicated that the transcriptional _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in the root tips of miao was _PROTEIN_ to and of wild type values respectively . the perturbed _PROTEIN_ and plt _PROTEIN_ indicates the impairment of the auxin/plt pathway in the oxidized glutathione environment of the miao ram . to elucidate the potential interaction between glutathione dependent redox signaling and auxin/plt signaling the plt double mutant _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ which shows strong defects in the ram and stem cell niche was crossed with miao . the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ miao triple mutant exhibited smaller seedling size serious ram defects and more disorganized columella cells than _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or miao . the additive phenotype of miao _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ suggests that auxin/plt and glutathione dependent redox signaling represent different pathways in ram _PROTEIN_ . next we introduced the dexamethasone inducible _PROTEIN_ overproduction transgenic line _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ receptor into the miao background . similar to a previous report _PROTEIN_ overproduction induced by dex significantly increased ram length by in the _PROTEIN_ glr wild type background while _PROTEIN_ overproduction conferred no increase in ram length in the miao background . however _PROTEIN_ glr/miao did exhibit ram expansion of and in response to dex in the medium supplemented with and mm gsh respectively . moreover the ram expansion induced by dex in the _PROTEIN_ glr wild type background was slightly inhibited by treatment with mm bso and more strongly inhibited by treatment with mm bso . these results indicate that the oxidized glutathione environment disrupts auxin/plt downstream effectors . in other words a reduced glutathione environment is required for the auxin/plt pathway to function in ram _PROTEIN_ . glutathione measurement with reverse phase hplc showed no significant differences in gsh and gssg between the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant and the wild type line _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ indicating that glutathione oxidation is not increased in the defective ram of the plt loss of function mutants . furthermore the application of mm gsh which was sufficient to rescue ram defects in miao did not rescue the defective ram in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ substantiating that the glutathione oxidization is not a mechanism of the ram defects in the loss of function of plt .
