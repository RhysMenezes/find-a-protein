in plant cells secretory and endocytic routes intersect at the trans _LOCATION_ network /early endosome where cargos are further sorted correctly and in a timely manner . cargo sorting is essential for plant survival and therefore necessitates complex molecular machinery . _PROTEIN_ proteins play key roles in this process by recruiting coat proteins and selecting cargos for different vesicle carriers . the subunit of ap in arabidopsis was recently identified at the tgn/ee and shown to be essential for cytokinesis . however little was known about other cellular activities affected by mutations in ap or the developmental consequences of such mutations . we report here that _PROTEIN_ the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ is essential for protein sorting at the tgn/ee . functional loss of _PROTEIN_ displayed pleiotropic developmental defects some of which were suggestive of disrupted auxin signaling . consistent with this the asymmetric localization of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ an auxin transporter was compromised in the mutant . in addition cell morphogenesis was disrupted . we further demonstrate that _PROTEIN_ is critical for brefeldin a sensitive but wortmannin insensitive post _LOCATION_ trafficking . our results show that _PROTEIN_ is a key link in the sophisticated trafficking network in plant cells .
to determine the _PROTEIN_ pattern of _PROTEIN_ we generated gus reporter lines and found out that _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ in all tissues throughout developmental stages including seedlings leaves roots and reproductive organs as well as in various cell types such as root hairs trichomes pollen and growing pollen tubes suggesting its function beyond the gametophytic stage . to determine the function of _PROTEIN_ in sporophytic tissues we characterized an additional allele of _PROTEIN_ and confirmed that no full length transcript of _PROTEIN_ could be detected in _PROTEIN_ . however a partial transcript potentially encoding a truncated _PROTEIN_ with the first amino acids _PROTEIN_ was detected in _PROTEIN_ . this truncated protein would be able to incorporate into the ap complex but unable to interact with cargo proteins according to the structure of its homologs in metazoa . homozygous _PROTEIN_ plants were obtained at a significantly distorted ratio due to defective male gametophytic function . _PROTEIN_ showed pleiotropic developmental defects . the growth of primary roots of _PROTEIN_ arrested precociously whereas the number of _PROTEIN_ roots increased significantly . wild type plants grown in soil for to d started the reproductive phase whereas _PROTEIN_ hardly made the transition to reproductive growth when grown in soil although it did manage to produce inflorescences when _PROTEIN_ on murashige and skoog _METHOD_ medium in sterile glass tubes . compared with the wild type _PROTEIN_ had compacted inflorescences due to less elongated pedicles . all four whorls were present but were much smaller in _PROTEIN_ than in the wild type . sepals _PROTEIN_ and pistils were deformed in _PROTEIN_ showing uneven surfaces loss of conical cell shape and nonelongating papilla cells respectively . because _PROTEIN_ showed early senescence we analyzed reactive oxygen species levels and cell death . indeed compared with the wild type at the same developmental stages both ros production and cell death were increased in _PROTEIN_ . ros production was higher in newly initiated rather than old _PROTEIN_ leaves whereas cell death was more severe in older true leaves than in cotyledons or newly initiated leaves of _PROTEIN_ . that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was detected in vascular tissues throughout development and _PROTEIN_ displayed defective organ formation suggested that _PROTEIN_ was essential for vascular development . to test this hypothesis we characterized the vasculature of leaves roots hypocotyls and _METHOD_ . the leaf venation network of _PROTEIN_ was different from that of the wild type in three aspects . first in contrast to the closed loops of the wild type _PROTEIN_ had incomplete loops such that all distal veins were open . second higher order veins present in the wild type _PROTEIN_ were absent in _PROTEIN_ . third vascular islands veins broken from the venation network were detected in _PROTEIN_ leaves . to determine whether these venation defects were due to defects in procambial formation or differentiation we introduced the procambial marker gus into _PROTEIN_ . similar venation defects were observed after staining for gus including highly reduced venation complexity incomplete loops as well as vascular islands suggesting that both procambial patterning and differentiation were defective in _PROTEIN_ . transmission electron micrography of leaf vasculature showed that the xylem of _PROTEIN_ did not form the lignified hollow tubular structure as in the wild type indicating defective programmed cell death of xylem cells . the vasculature of _METHOD_ from just bolted plants or below the inflorescence typically contains six to eight vascular bundles that are distributed in an orderly circular way centering on heterogenous parenchyma cells . within each bundle the phloem and the xylem are separated by a fascicular cambium that continues to differentiate into either phloem or xylem . however the ordered distribution of vascular bundles was lost in _PROTEIN_ such that all vascular bundles either formed a continuous organization or were distributed randomly within the stem . within each discernible vascular bundle in _PROTEIN_ the normal spatial distribution of phloem and xylem was disrupted . in addition both the phloem and the interfascicular cambium were hardly detected . in contrast to the absence of both phloem and interfascicular cambium the cells of the cortex layer surrounding the vascular bundles had proliferated . despite the deformation of vascular _METHOD_ in the aerial parts of _PROTEIN_ the vascular development of roots and hypocotyls in _PROTEIN_ was not discernibly different from that of the wild type indicating that _PROTEIN_ might be essential for vascular development in the aerial parts . the developmental defects of _PROTEIN_ such as leaf morphogenesis vascular development as well as root growth suggested altered auxin signaling . to determine if auxin distribution was perturbed in _PROTEIN_ we introduced the synthetic auxin response promoter in _PROTEIN_ and analyzed the _PROTEIN_ of gus or _METHOD_ reporters . gus signals were mostly restricted to the apex and slightly along the edge of cotyledons at d after germination as well as at the primary root tips in the wild type . by contrast ectopic gus signals were detected at the basal parts of the _PROTEIN_ cotyledons . in roots gus signals were weak in the root tips of _PROTEIN_ but expanded ectopically . these _PROTEIN_ patterns were confirmed by _METHOD_ instead of the strong and spatially restricted signals in the wild type weak but expanded _METHOD_ signals were detected in _PROTEIN_ suggestive of a compromised auxin gradient in _PROTEIN_ . we further tested the root gravitropic response a dynamic process regulated by auxin . indeed roots of _PROTEIN_ were less responsive to gravity . the hyposensitivity of _PROTEIN_ to gravity was confirmed by histochemical analysis of gus _PROTEIN_ . in addition columena cells that sense gravity were ordered in the wild type but disorganized in _PROTEIN_ . these results suggested compromised auxin distribution in _PROTEIN_ . because _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ in most if not all cell types we asked if cell morphogenesis was affected in _PROTEIN_ . wild type leaves were flat and symmetric . by contrast _PROTEIN_ leaves were rugged and asymmetric . leaf pavement cells were significantly smaller and lost their characteristic jigsaw puzzle shape in _PROTEIN_ . trichomes are less complex in _PROTEIN_ most trichomes on _PROTEIN_ leaves showed only one branch while three branches were typical on the wild type . defects in cell morphogenesis in _PROTEIN_ extended to the epidermal and cortex cells in roots and hypocotyls . the wild type showed rectangle shaped epidermal or cortex cells from longitudinal growth whereas the growth _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ cells was disrupted leading to irregularly shaped or ballooning cells . root hairs the other tip growing cells in addition to pollen tubes were either bulged or hardly initiated in _PROTEIN_ further demonstrating the importance of _PROTEIN_ in cell _PROTEIN_ and morphogenesis . to confirm that the observed defects were indeed due to functional disruption of _PROTEIN_ we introduced a _METHOD_ translational fusion of the _PROTEIN_ genomic fragment into _PROTEIN_ . transcript and phenotypic analyses showed that exogenous _PROTEIN_ fully rescued the defects of _PROTEIN_ confirming that the phenotypes were due to the mutation in _PROTEIN_ . because the _METHOD_ translational fusion did not interfere with the function of _PROTEIN_ it was used to determine the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ . consistent with what was reported recently stable transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ red _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ showed punctate vesicles that were sensitive to bfa but not to wortmannin confirming its identity as the tgn/ee . to further confirm that _PROTEIN_ is the bona fide subunit of ap we introduced _PROTEIN_ into the yeast _PROTEIN_ mutant in which the subunit of ap was nonfunctional . _PROTEIN_ complemented the _LOCATION_ fusion defect of the yeast _PROTEIN_ mutant upon osmotic stress albeit to a lesser extent than by _PROTEIN_ further proving _PROTEIN_ as the _PROTEIN_ of ap . to determine which trafficking routes are regulated by _PROTEIN_ we first used the endocytic tracer in an uptake study . pulse labeled entered into cells via endocytic trafficking and finally reached the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ in the wild type as reported . entry from the pm was significantly increased in _PROTEIN_ at various time points as represented by the number of endosomes . treatment with bfa resulted in intracellular aggregation of signals in the wild type while bfa washout redistributed from the intracellular aggregates to endosomes . by contrast a significantly larger amount of the signal remained at endosomes upon bfa treatment in _PROTEIN_ suggesting reduced sensitivity to bfa . bfa compartments in _PROTEIN_ were fewer and smaller . a large amount of the signal was still enclosed in bfa compartments beside endosome signals upon bfa washout . to confirm the results obtained with uptake we also performed an ultrastructural study using tem . no difference _PROTEIN_ the distribution of _LOCATION_ and its associated vesicles was obvious in root epidermal cells of the wild type and _PROTEIN_ . bfa treatment induced aggregates of small vesicles that were surrounded with numerous _LOCATION_ in the wild type . by contrast aggregates in _PROTEIN_ were smaller and more irregular . in addition individual vesicles within the aggregates were larger in _PROTEIN_ than in the wild type upon bfa treatment . bfa washout redistributed vesicles from the bfa compartments accompanied by randomly redistributed _LOCATION_ in the wild type . however the aggregates in _PROTEIN_ were insensitive to bfa washout . in addition individual vesicles within the bfa compartments were enlarged in _PROTEIN_ . these results suggested that _PROTEIN_ is critical for bfa sensitive post _LOCATION_ trafficking from the tgn/ee to the pvc/mvb . at h reaches the tonoplast . however the morphology of the tonoplast seemed irregular in _PROTEIN_ relative to that in the wild type . therefore we introduced a _METHOD_ tonoplast marker into _PROTEIN_ to assess this apparent irregularity . root cells of the wild type contained gradually maturing _LOCATION_ in the root tip to the root hair elongation zone where a fully expanded central _LOCATION_ occupied the entire cell . by contrast numerous smaller _LOCATION_ were still present in differentiated cells in _PROTEIN_ suggesting defective _LOCATION_ fusion . to further dissect vesicle trafficking routes in which _PROTEIN_ plays critical roles we introduced _METHOD_ protein fusions of potential cargos in _PROTEIN_ and analyzed their dynamic subcellular distribution . brassinosteroid _PROTEIN_ is an _PROTEIN_ distributed at the pm and at punctate vesicles in the wild type due to its constitutive endocytic recycling . in comparison a higher percentage of _PROTEIN_ signals were detected as punctate vesicles in _PROTEIN_ than in the wild type . bfa together with the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide caused an aggregation of _PROTEIN_ yellow _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ to the bfa compartments in the wild type and in _PROTEIN_ . washout of bfa in the presence of chx relocated _PROTEIN_ from the bfa compartments to the pm and punctate vesicles in the wild type . by contrast a higher percentage of _PROTEIN_ signals were still present in the bfa compartments and in the cytoplasm in _PROTEIN_ after bfa washout while they were hardly detected at the pm . these results suggested that bfa sensitive recycling of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ from the tgn/ee to the pm requires _PROTEIN_ function . we next analyzed the localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ since _PROTEIN_ is critical for gravitropic responses and gravitropism was compromised in _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was distributed asymmetrically in the epidermal cells of wild type roots as reported . by contrast the distribution of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in _PROTEIN_ was irregular at the pm . bfa together with chx induced the aggregation of _PROTEIN_ to bfa compartments in both the wild type and _PROTEIN_ . however a portion of the _PROTEIN_ signal was still detected at punctate vesicles in _PROTEIN_ suggesting hyposensitivity to bfa . bfa washout in the presence of chx relocated _PROTEIN_ to the pm in the wild type . by contrast a large fraction of signals were detected at punctate vesicles as well as _LOCATION_ in _PROTEIN_ after bfa washout . these results suggested that the asymmetric localization of _PROTEIN_ at the pm through recycling from the tgn/ee requires _PROTEIN_ .
