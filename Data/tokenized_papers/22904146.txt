the timing of the transition to flowering in plants is regulated by various environmental _PROTEIN_ including daylength and light quality . although the red/far red photoreceptor phytochrome b _PROTEIN_ represses flowering by indirectly regulating the _PROTEIN_ of a key flowering regulator flowering locus t _PROTEIN_ the mechanism of _PROTEIN_ signaling for flowering is largely unknown . here we identified two arabidopsis thaliana genes vascular plant one zinc _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ which are highly conserved throughout land plant evolution as _PROTEIN_ interacting _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutants but neither single mutant showed a _PROTEIN_ flowering phenotype under long day conditions which indicated that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ redundantly promote flowering . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutations suppressed the early flowering phenotype of the _PROTEIN_ mutant and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was repressed in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutant . green _METHOD_ protein _PROTEIN_ signal was observed in the cytoplasm and interaction of voz proteins with _PROTEIN_ was indicated to occur in the cytoplasm under far red light . however _PROTEIN_ protein modified to localize constitutively in the _LOCATION_ promoted flowering . in addition the stability of _PROTEIN_ proteins in the _LOCATION_ was modulated by light quality in a phytochrome dependent manner . we propose that partial translocation of voz proteins from the cytoplasm to the _LOCATION_ mediates the initial step of the _PROTEIN_ signal transduction pathway that regulates flowering .
we performed a yeast two hybrid screen to identify proteins associated with _PROTEIN_ . among candidates for _PROTEIN_ interacting _PROTEIN_ were _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ which have a zinc finger motif and transcriptional activator activities . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ belong to the subgroup viii of the nac proteins which comprise one of the largest transcription _PROTEIN_ families in plants . in vitro pull down experiments also confirmed the interaction of _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ . to evaluate the functions of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in phytochrome signaling in vivo we examined phenotypes of t dna insertional mutants of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . no transcripts were detected for the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ alleles . the _PROTEIN_ mutant allele carries a t dna insertion that interrupts the first intron upstream of the start codon . in the _PROTEIN_ mutant only truncated transcripts were detected . to examine the effect of this t dna insertion on _PROTEIN_ protein levels we performed protein gel blot analysis using anti _PROTEIN_ antibodies . no _PROTEIN_ protein signal was detected in _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ mutants which indicated that both mutants are loss of function alleles . we then examined whether the single and double mutants of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ showed any visible phenotypes . the double mutants showed an apparent _PROTEIN_ flowering phenotype under normal growth conditions . the flowering time of the mutants was measured under different photoperiods . under both _PROTEIN_ and sd conditions none of the single mutants showed a significant difference in flowering time . to test the possibility of functional overlap of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ we analyzed two lines of double mutants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . both double mutants showed a _PROTEIN_ flowering phenotype under _PROTEIN_ conditions . under sd conditions the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ but not _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutant displayed a delayed flowering time when measured as number of days to bolting which suggested that the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutant exhibited developmental retardation under sd conditions . to confirm that the observed flowering phenotypes were caused by the defective voz genes we performed complementation experiments . either construct that carried a genomic fragment of _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ rescued the flowering time defect in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant . this result indicated that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ regulate flowering time redundantly . we did not observe other phytochrome related phenotypes in the mutants . the hypocotyl length of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutants was unaltered compared with that of wild type seedlings under both red and far red light conditions . the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutants also displayed normal plant architecture and the accumulation levels of pigments such as chlorophyll and anthocyanin were largely unaffected . to examine the genetic relationship between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in the flowering pathway we measured the flowering time in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ triple mutant and the _PROTEIN_ mutant . the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutation completely suppressed the early flowering phenotype of the _PROTEIN_ mutant under both _PROTEIN_ and sd conditions which strongly suggested that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are essential for _PROTEIN_ regulation of flowering time . the elongated petiole leaf hyponasty and reduced leaf area phenotypes of the _PROTEIN_ mutant were unaffected in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutant . this result together with the normal hypocotyl length phenotype and complete suppression of the _PROTEIN_ early flowering phenotype suggested that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ function downstream of _PROTEIN_ specifically in the flowering pathway . since voz proteins interact with _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ represses _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in leaves _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were predicted to function in leaves . organ specific _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ was not discriminated clearly by rt pcr analysis . we isolated mesophyll protoplasts and vascular bundles from cotyledons to examine tissue specific _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in leaves . we used tissue specific _PROTEIN_ marker genes ribulose bisphosphate _PROTEIN_ small subunit _PROTEIN_ for mesophyll cells and sucrose proton _PROTEIN_ for vascular bundles to verify separation of the tissues . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in the mesophyll sample was times higher than that in the vascular bundle sample whereas _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was detected predominantly in the vascular bundle sample which demonstrated separation of the tissues of interest . _PROTEIN_ was readily detectable in vascular bundles but not in mesophyll cells whereas _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ in mesophyll cells as well as vascular bundles . to monitor the temporal and spatial _PROTEIN_ patterns of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ we generated transgenic lines that _PROTEIN_ translational fusions of the voz genomic fragment to the bacterial uida gene which encodes _PROTEIN_ driven by the voz promoter in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutant . the _PROTEIN_ flowering phenotype of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutant was complemented in all of the five independent provoz gus voz lines examined and the gus staining pattern was consistent among lines carrying the construct . consistent with the results of mrna _PROTEIN_ patterns gus _PROTEIN_ signals were detected exclusively in the phloem whereas gus _PROTEIN_ signals were detected in the leaf as a whole . the _PROTEIN_ patterns of gus voz proteins remain unchanged during vegetative growth . given that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ redundantly regulate flowering and that both are _PROTEIN_ in vascular bundles the functional site of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ for flowering was indicated to be the vascular bundles . to investigate how _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ regulate flowering we examined their role in the regulation of key genes that affect flowering time . _PROTEIN_ is an integrator of several flowering pathways and has been proposed to be downregulated by _PROTEIN_ . we first analyzed the diurnal _PROTEIN_ patterns of _PROTEIN_ in cotyledons and rosette leaves using d old seedlings grown under _PROTEIN_ conditions . as reported previously _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in wild type plants was maximal h after dawn under _PROTEIN_ conditions . however _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was repressed significantly in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutant and the peak observed in _PROTEIN_ daytime in wild type plants was eliminated . this repression of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was observed in the cotyledons and rosette leaves although the repression was more prominent in rosette leaves . next we examined the _PROTEIN_ levels of _PROTEIN_ upstream _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ is a key _PROTEIN_ of the photoperiod pathway and known to be an activator of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ pattern was similar in wild type plants and the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutant but the peaks of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in rosette leaves in _PROTEIN_ daytime and at midnight were less prominent in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutant . _PROTEIN_ is a floral repressor that functions in the autonomous and vernalization pathways and represses _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . intriguingly _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ levels in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutant were remarkably higher than those of wild type plants throughout the day . the difference in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ between wild type plants and the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutant was greater in rosette leaves than in cotyledons . these observations suggested that the _PROTEIN_ flowering phenotype of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutant is caused by the increase in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and subsequent _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in leaves . to visualize its subcellular localization _PROTEIN_ was fused to the c terminus of the green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ . the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ coding sequence driven by the cauliflower mosaic virus promoter complemented the _PROTEIN_ flowering phenotype of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutant which indicated that the fused _PROTEIN_ protein was functional . however no effects of excessive _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were observed both under _PROTEIN_ and sd conditions . we then observed the subcellular localization of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ under a laser scanning confocal microscope . in epidermal cells vascular bundle cells and mesophyll cells _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ signals were detected _PROTEIN_ in the cytoplasm and their localization was not markedly affected by light quality . although _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ signal was detected _PROTEIN_ in the cytoplasm the presence of a zinc finger motif and a nac domain in voz proteins strongly suggested that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ function in the _LOCATION_ . to investigate this enigma we analyzed the functional intracellular localization of _PROTEIN_ . we fused the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ protein to a _LOCATION_ localization signal or a _LOCATION_ export signal and _PROTEIN_ the fusion proteins in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutant . the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ transcripts were detected in all lines examined and two each representative lines were checked to overexpress _PROTEIN_ mrna compared with columbia . the accumulation level of the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ nls protein was significantly lower than that of the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ nes protein but the _PROTEIN_ flowering phenotype of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutant was complemented in the transgenic lines bearing the nls construct . by contrast the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ nes protein was readily detected in the transgenic lines but failed to complement the _PROTEIN_ flowering phenotype . these results indicated that _LOCATION_ localization of the _PROTEIN_ protein is essential for its function in flowering . in addition together with the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ line the distinct surplus effect of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ nls overexpression was not observed in the flowering phenotype and flowering gene _PROTEIN_ under both _PROTEIN_ and sd conditions . to confirm that voz proteins function in the _LOCATION_ we performed a cell fractionation experiment to establish the presence of voz proteins in the _LOCATION_ . we examined the abundance of the _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ proteins in the _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ fraction isolated from d old seedlings of col and the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ line respectively . protein blot analysis using antibodies specific to the marker proteins confirmed that each fraction was relatively free from contamination . udp glc pyrophosphorylase _PROTEIN_ was detected only in the _LOCATION_ fraction and histone was present only in the _LOCATION_ fraction . as indicated by the intensity of the histone signal a portion of the _LOCATION_ fraction was lost during handling . to detect a clear signal in the _LOCATION_ fraction the fraction was concentrated fivefold . although _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ signals were clearly more abundant in the _LOCATION_ fraction than in the _LOCATION_ fraction of col and the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ line respectively consistent with our _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ confocal image data we detected distinct _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ signals in the concentrated _LOCATION_ fraction . interactions between _PROTEIN_ and voz proteins were detected by bimolecular _METHOD_ complementation analysis in which plasmids bearing _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ fused with the n terminal half of the yellow _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ fused with the c terminal half of _METHOD_ were introduced into nicotiana benthamiana by agrobacterium tumefaciens infiltration . the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ voz interactions was detected only in the cytoplasm and did not change under red far red and dark conditions whereas _PROTEIN_ is reportedly localized in the _LOCATION_ under red light . in our transient _PROTEIN_ experiment using n. benthamiana _LOCATION_ translocalization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ under red light was partial possibly because of an excessive amount of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein . it should be noted that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signal under red light in arabidopsis transgenic lines carrying the same construct was observed only in the _LOCATION_ . these results suggested that the voz protein can interact with _PROTEIN_ in the cytoplasm . to confirm the interactions between _PROTEIN_ and voz proteins in vivo we performed a coimmunoprecipitation experiment using _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ transgenic plants and the anti _PROTEIN_ antibody . we obtained evidence of interaction between _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ under far red light irradiation but not under red light irradiation . when the _METHOD_ line was used as a negative control under far red light conditions the _PROTEIN_ signal was not detected . these co ip data are consistent with the results from bifc which showed that _PROTEIN_ and voz proteins interacted in the cytoplasm . given the abundant cytoplasmic accumulation of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ voz interaction in the cytoplasm and voz function in the _LOCATION_ voz might be translocated from the cytoplasm to the _LOCATION_ and be subjected to degradation which could be regulated by light . to examine accumulation of the voz protein in the _LOCATION_ under different light conditions wild type and transgenic plants were exposed either to white red or far red light or the dark for h. in wild type plants the amount of _PROTEIN_ protein was slightly reduced under far red and dark conditions . by contrast the amount of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ nls protein in the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plant was markedly reduced under far red and dark conditions whereas the amount of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ nes protein in the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plant was not altered by light conditions . to evaluate the effect of light on voz transcription we compared the mrna levels of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in the wild type and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plants under different light conditions . in contrast with their protein products mrna levels of voz genes and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in the wild type and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ respectively were slightly elevated under far red and dark conditions except that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was unaffected in the dark . these results suggested that the amount of voz proteins is regulated posttranslationally in the _LOCATION_ by light . to determine whether any active proteolytic process was involved in the regulation we treated seedlings of the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ lines with the proteasome inhibitor . the treatment diminished _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ nls degradation under far red light which suggested that the degradation of voz proteins in the _LOCATION_ is mediated by the proteasome system . in the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ line two signals for the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ nls protein were detected . to examine the possibility of protein modification by phosphorylation _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ nls was incubated with protein phosphatase . the treatment specifically diminished the larger _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ nls form thus indicating that a portion of the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ nls protein pool is phosphorylated . to investigate the contribution of phytochromes to the far red and dark induced degradation of _PROTEIN_ we examined native _PROTEIN_ levels in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and mutants . _PROTEIN_ is primarily involved in far red light sensing . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ encode the enzymes for phytochrome chromophore biosynthesis thus the mutant has been used as a mutant with no functional phytochrome members . a lower degree of _PROTEIN_ degradation was observed in the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants under far red light . furthermore the _PROTEIN_ protein level was largely unaffected in the mutant compared with the parental ecotype landsberg _LOCATION_ under far red light . these results suggested that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ as well as the other phytochrome members are involved in light dependent _PROTEIN_ degradation .
