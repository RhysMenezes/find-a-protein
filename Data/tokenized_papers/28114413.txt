brassinosteroids are plant hormones that are perceived at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ by the ligand binding receptor brassinosteroid _PROTEIN_ and the co receptor _PROTEIN_ embryogenesis receptor like kinase associated kinase _PROTEIN_ . to visualize _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ mcherry in the plane of the pm variable angle _METHOD_ microscopy was employed which allows selective illumination of a thin surface layer . vaem revealed an inhomogeneous distribution of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ mcherry at the pm which we attribute to the presence of distinct nanoclusters . neither the _PROTEIN_ nor the _PROTEIN_ nanocluster density is affected by depletion of endogenous ligands or application of exogenous ligands . to reveal interacting populations of receptor complexes we utilized selective surface _METHOD_ lifetime imaging microscopy for the detection of resonance energy transfer . using this approach we observed hetero oligomerisation of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in the nanoclusters which did not change upon depletion of endogenous ligand or signal activation . upon ligand application however the number of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ hetero oligomers was reduced possibly due to endocytosis of active signalling units of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ residing in the pm . we propose that formation of nanoclusters in the plant pm is subjected to biophysical restraints while the stoichiometry of receptors inside these nanoclusters is variable and important for signal transduction .
to investigate the distribution of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ mcherry at the pm we imaged these receptors using vaem . both receptors form hetero oligomeric complexes required for signal transduction and are part of the same signalling pathway . vaem showed that neither _PROTEIN_ nor _PROTEIN_ is homogenously distributed . furthermore a clear punctuated pattern was seen for both receptors in contrast to the homogeneous distribution of pm marker b an integral _LOCATION_ protein . similar receptor distributions in animal cells are referred to as nanoclusters a term that we will employ here as well . nanoclusters of clearly variable _METHOD_ intensities were observed with an average size of approximately pixels per cluster which corresponds to a diameter of nm . these nanoclusters were observed for both the _PROTEIN_ receptor _PROTEIN_ and the coreceptor _PROTEIN_ . the receptors can be visualized by vaem in the epidermal root cells of the elongation zone an area where br signalling is reported to be active . the root meristem zone itself can not be visualized due to curvature of the root which causes the epidermal cell layer to be outside the critical range for vaem . our vaem setup was capable of visualizing endosomes and other internal _LOCATION_ compartments demonstrated by imaging of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ marker . also the _LOCATION_ marker mcherry was visualized using vaem . in plant cells the _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ a net like basket occupying the cortical space just below the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . time lapse imaging revealed that the _LOCATION_ is a mobile and dynamic organelle . we used additional markers of _LOCATION_ stacks _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ and retrograde trafficking _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ . typical vaem images of live root epidermal cells of day old a. thaliana seedlings showing pm distribution of bri _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ line and _PROTEIN_ mcherry _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in a _PROTEIN_ mutant plant . images taken are of epidermal cells in the early elongation zone . scale bars represent . endosomal vesicles on the cytoplasmic side of the pm were clearly visible for both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ with a higher number of _PROTEIN_ containing vesicles compared to _PROTEIN_ . especially _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ line which has approximately higher _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ compared to wild type shows a large number of _METHOD_ endosomal compartments which are reminiscent of _PROTEIN_ compartments . interestingly only a small number of nanoclusters containing _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were seen to disappear from the pm even in the presence of brassinazole a potent brassinosteroid synthesis inhibitor . upon application of bl we did not observe a difference in the rate of internalization of nanoclusters from the pm by endocytosis . recently the existence of ligand independent _PROTEIN_ endocytosis was discussed in reference . brassinosteroid signalling is dependent on both the presence of the _PROTEIN_ ligand binding receptor _PROTEIN_ and the _PROTEIN_ co receptors . in the root the active signalling complex consists of _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ and/or _PROTEIN_ . we recently showed that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ co localize in the pm and that a minor amount of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ receptors is already present in preformed complexes . to test whether the co receptors influence the distribution of the _PROTEIN_ receptor in the pm the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ line was crossed into a _PROTEIN_ mutant background . vaem showed that in the absence of both co receptors the distribution of the _PROTEIN_ ligand binding receptor and the overall _METHOD_ intensity are barely affected compared to _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ line in wild type roots . roots of _PROTEIN_ double mutants are almost completely insensitive to bl indicating that no active signalling complexes are formed . our results thus imply that _PROTEIN_ co receptors do not participate in _PROTEIN_ the pm distribution of _PROTEIN_ in epidermal cells of arabidopsis roots . by combining the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ pm receptor density data from with the number of nanoclusters per pm determined in this work we estimated the number of receptors present in each nanocluster . in this analysis we assumed perfect maturation efficiency of _METHOD_ proteins leading to a possible underestimation of receptor quantities but still provide information between _PROTEIN_ levels between different lines . for example at near endogenous receptor levels we estimated that at least _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ receptors are present in each nanocluster . intriguingly while overexpression of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ resulted in about a three fold increase in pm receptor density there is no concomitant increase in nanocluster density . in _PROTEIN_ the density of _PROTEIN_ nanoclusters appeared to be even slightly lower in cells of the overexpression line . two explanations are conceivable first either the nanoclusters harbouring pm located receptors can accommodate variable numbers or second a larger number of receptors is distributed more uniformly outside of the pm nanocluster domains upon overexpression . in the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ line about two fold more nanoclusters were present compared to _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ line of which each contained at least two receptors . a similar calculation for the _PROTEIN_ mcherry line resulted in about receptors per nanocluster . the number of receptors per nanocluster is in line with estimates based on single molecule photo bleaching analysis . the average number of receptors and the number of nanoclusters per allows calculating the average number of receptors per nanocluster . numbers are given with their respective standard _LOCATION_ of the mean _PROTEIN_ . for each experiment three different roots were recorded using confocal imaging . n number of individual cells . values are given . data from a third plant receptor was investigated to rule out that the observed nanocluster distribution pattern was an inherent property of only these two receptors . _PROTEIN_ is an abundant pm receptor like kinase for which the related members _PROTEIN_ and have been implicated as stabilizing components of pm receptor complexes involved in pathogen triggered immunity . similar to _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ is distributed heterogeneously in the pm including punctuated pattern suggesting that a distribution into nanoclusters is a common configuration for plant _LOCATION_ receptors . other pm proteins such as remorins and flottilins also showed nanocluster arrangements harbouring about domains per . in order to determine whether _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ receptor distribution across the pm is affected by activation of the br signalling pathway seedlings were first depleted of endogenous ligands by incubation with brz . prior to vaem the bl depleted seedlings were incubated with bl which is the biologically most active brassinosteroid for h. this treatment is routinely used to fully activate the br signalling pathway and optimized to achieve a near maximal receptor ligand occupancy . interestingly under these conditions of full activation only a minor amount of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ mcherry was previously found to interact . it was therefore of great interest to test whether changes in the distribution or number of nanoclusters would be visible upon full activation of the signalling pathway . surprisingly we could not detect any significant change in the number of clusters per at the pm or cluster size for both _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ mcherry between the brz treated roots and the brz bl treated roots . roots _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mcherry showed a non significant increase in the number of clusters upon brz treatment . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ distribution was also not affected in the brassinosteroid synthesis mutant _PROTEIN_ which contains less than of the normal wt levels of brassinosteroids . quantification of nanocluster density and size of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ mcherry of day old arabidopsis seedlings showing the average number of nanoclusters per and average cluster size in upon different treatments using vaem . brz was added to growth media for days prior to ligand application . ligand application was accomplished by incubation of seedlings with bl for . all experiments were performed twice three images were collected for three seedlings per experiment . numbers are given with their respective pooled standard _LOCATION_ of the mean _PROTEIN_ . using vaem we observed different mobility states ranging from static for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ to rapid directional movement _LOCATION_ marker . in order to characterize the mobility of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ receptors in the pm we performed _METHOD_ recovery after photobleaching on _METHOD_ labelled receptors _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis roots . in the elongation zone of arabidopsis root cells _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ showed a slow diffusion and a mobile fraction of and for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ respectively . these values were at the lower end of s reported for free _PROTEIN_ diffusion of a pm receptor and of control measurement . in meristem cells the diffusion coefficients were even lower rendering both receptors virtually immobile . further analysis employing a one dimensional gaussian fit of the _METHOD_ intensity over the cross section of the pm suggests that most of the observed mobility in the elongation zone is due to replenishment from internal receptor pools . in a similar study by wang and coworkers _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was _PROTEIN_ under its native promoter in col background and a diffusion coefficient of s was found which is in similar range to our observations in meristem cells . taken together our vaem and frap data suggest that both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ receptors are distributed in pm nanoclusters which are largely immobile and contain only a limited number of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ receptors . typical images of frap experiment prior and post bleach pulse of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . recovery curves of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in epidermal cells in the root meristem . around s after bleaching _METHOD_ intensity of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ at the pm is fully restored . no such recovery is observed for _PROTEIN_

mobile fraction . d diffusion coefficient . values are given _PROTEIN_ all three integral _LOCATION_ receptors investigated in this study _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and showed a similar distribution of nanoclusters . in addition _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ nanocluster distribution was not affected upon ligand induced activation . to investigate the underlying mechanism regulating _LOCATION_ distribution we treated arabidopsis roots with various inhibitors of the endocytic _LOCATION_ or biosynthetic pathways . treatment of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ mcherry seedlings with cycloheximide latrunculin b or brefeldin a either alone or in combination with brz or with brz and bl did not result in any consistent change in distribution of either receptor . a limitation of vaem is the inability to report on the interaction between _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ hetero oligomers . we therefore performed sso fret flim by focussing the confocal spot at the pm of root epidermal cells . as expected _METHOD_ intensity images obtained with this approach revealed a similar distribution of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ nanoclusters as found using vaem . notably vaem can acquire single images within a few hundred milliseconds whereas a sso confocal image requires an acquisition time between one and two minutes . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ line _PROTEIN_ in root epidermal cells imaged using vaem or sso confocal imaging . both imaging modalities show similar nanocluster distributions . scale bars represent . the spatial distribution of _METHOD_ lifetimes of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ nanoclusters is not homogeneous even though the standard deviation of all samples analysed is small . at present it is not clear whether this is due to small local variations in the immediate environment of the receptors inside nanoclusters or whether it is due to technical limitations such as the precision by which the confocal volume can be positioned with respect to the plane of the pm . in root cells _PROTEIN_ both _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ mcherry a small number of nanoclusters showed reduced _METHOD_ lifetimes . this observation indicated that a few nanoclusters located in the root epidermal cell pm contain both receptors in close proximity leading to a detectable fret signal . brz treatment followed by application of bl showed only a minor reduction in overall _METHOD_ lifetimes of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ mcherry _PROTEIN_ root cells as determined by sso fret flim . this finding is in full accordance with recently published data using conventional fret flim showing only a small increase in interaction between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ upon full activation of the signalling pathway . no significant change of donor _METHOD_ lifetimes was observed in roots depleted of endogenous bl or stimulated with bl independent of analysis conditions suggesting that that no significant changes in the size or composition of nanoclusters occurred upon ligand application . sso

difference is significant at the when compared to the donor only sample _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . all seedlings were depleted of endogenous brassinosteroids with brz and treated with bl . represents the average _METHOD_ lifetime of the _METHOD_ in picoseconds _PROTEIN_ . ips represents the percentage of interacting pixels and n the number of _METHOD_ lifetime images analysed . we recently introduced the concept of interaction pixels to obtain a more quantitative description of the occurrence of fret detected by flim . briefly this method determines the number of pixels in an image that have sufficiently high photon counts as well as a strongly reduced _METHOD_ lifetime and reports these as a percentage of the total number of pixels . using ips in conventional fret flim we previously showed that upon bl stimulation in brz pre treated _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ mcherry _PROTEIN_ roots the ips increased from about to . using the same analysis method for our sso fret flim results we determined an ips of in ligand depleted roots . this percentage is about two fold higher compared to the found previously using conventional fret flim . the increase of ips in sso fret flim is possibly due to imaging a larger area of pm located receptors oriented perpendicular to the focal plane . surprisingly ligand application resulted in a reduction in the percentage of ips to about instead of the increase noted earlier . a plausible explanation for this discrepancy can be found in movies of root cells recorded either in vaem or in sso mode . during active signalling occasionally nanoclusters were seen to be endocytosed and thus rapidly disappearing from the pm . given the _PROTEIN_ that there is no overall change in the number of _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ containing nanoclusters in the pm after bl ligand application we conclude that the reduction in ips is _PROTEIN_ due to endocytosis of nanoclusters containing interacting _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ receptors . we evaluated a series of individual nanoclusters to determine whether the _METHOD_ lifetimes of individual bright nanoclusters changed during active br signalling possibly reflecting a change in the composition of interacting and non interacting _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ pairs within a cluster . no significant changes were observed upon ligand application suggesting that the composition per nanocluster remains unchanged . there also does not seem to be any correlation between the intensity of the nanoclusters and the reduction of donor _METHOD_ lifetime . _METHOD_ lifetime distribution plots of nanoclusters

arabidopsis thaliana plants of ecotype columbia were used as wild type . seeds were surface sterilized and germinated on murashige and skoog medium supplemented with sucrose and daishin agar . plants were grown at under _METHOD_ light with h dark photoperiods . col plants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ fused to _METHOD_ under its native promoter here referred to as _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ line were provided by n. geldner . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ line is a _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ line overexpressing the transgene roughly three fold and was provided by j. _PROTEIN_ . col plants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mcherry or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ under control of its native promoter were generated as previously described . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ line was crossed with the _PROTEIN_ mcherry line to create a plant harbouring both transgenes . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutant plants harbouring _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was produced by crossing _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ line with the double mutant _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ resulting in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ line . the _PROTEIN_ seeds were obtained from the arabidopsis seed stock centre and crossed with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ line . col plants containing the transgenes mcherry and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were provided by n. geldner _METHOD_ was provided by c. ten hove _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ rab _METHOD_ were provided by k. schumacher heidelberg . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was used as a positive control for the frap experiments based on the data of . the _METHOD_ line was constructed by walter van dongen . for hormone treatment six day old seedlings were incubated in ml murashige and skoog medium supplemented with sucrose and epi brassinolide . for brassinazole treatment seeds were first germinated and grown for four days on murashige and skoog medium supplemented with sucrose and daishin agar . after four days the seedlings were transferred to plates complemented with brassinazole and grown on these plates for an additional two days . for fret flim experiments day old seedlings were used . the seedlings were transferred to ml _METHOD_ medium containing brz days post germination for an additional two days . br signalling was induced by incubation of seedlings with bl for hour . in total internal reflection _METHOD_ microscopy _PROTEIN_ the laser light is focussed into the rim of the backfocal plane of a microscope objective with high numerical aperture . as a result the strong inclination of the passing laser light leads to the phenomena of total internal reflection at the interface between the cover slip and the sample medium due to the lower refractive index of the sample medium . even though the light does not pass the interface an evanescent wave is generated which decays exponentially within a few hundred nanometers . in animal cells _PROTEIN_ has been used to visualize proteins located in the pm . in plant cells however utilisation of _PROTEIN_ is hampered due to presence of the plant cell wall whose _PROTEIN_ is comparable to the effective excitation depth of the evanescent wave . an alternative to _PROTEIN_ is vaem in which the laser light is focussed closer to the centre of the backfocal plane such that not all light is reflected at the interface between the cover glass and water instead a thin band of illuminating light penetrates the sample allowing for greater penetration depth and yielding a high signal to noise ratio for visualizing biological processes at or near the pm of living cells . by varying the position of the focus in the backfocal plane we can adjust the depth at which the sample is illuminated . due to the curvature of the plant root only a narrow region of the outer pm of the epidermal root cells in close proximity to the cover slip was visualized . live root imaging was performed on a home build microscopy setup described in . the setup is equipped with a _PROTEIN_ objective and an ixon ultra emccd camera with x pixel for imaging . the total magnification of the microscope is x corresponding to a pixel size of nm . data was recorded using micromanager . _METHOD_ was excited with a nm laser and _METHOD_ emission was detected from nm . mcherry was excited with a nm laser and _METHOD_ emission was detected from nm . movies containing or frames were recorded every _METHOD_ with an exposure time of _METHOD_ . imagej and fiji were used for data processing _PROTEIN_ was performed . for the analysis of nanoclusters a gaussian blur filter of was applied to the _METHOD_ intensity image . the resulting binary image was thresholded at a.u . and subsequently analysed using the plugin for particle analysis of image j . for quantification of the number of receptors per nanocluster we defined areas of pixels as region of interest and analysed bleaching decay curves by plotting z axis profile function . roots of arabidopsis seedlings _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ line _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were imaged with a zeiss _PROTEIN_ confocal microscope equipped with a water objective and an argon laser . for frap analysis the pm was scanned at nm excitation with a laser power of and for _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ respectively . the _METHOD_ intensity of _METHOD_ was detected with a band pass filter at nm . the image size was set to pixels and four scans were averaged for each picture . after scans a high intensity bleach pulse at nm was applied over the selected area . subsequently the _METHOD_ recovery was followed for s and s for _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ respectively . frap data analysis was performed by subtracting the background signal from the raw data followed by a normalisation of the _METHOD_ intensity between zero and one . the normalised data were plotted using _METHOD_ excel which was also used for curve fitting . resonance energy transfer is a process in which excitation energy is transferred from a donor fluorophore to an acceptor chromophore through nonradiative dipole dipole coupling . this process can only occur if _METHOD_ donor and acceptor molecules are at very close proximity . the energy transfer rate is proportional to the inverse power of the distance r between donor and acceptor which makes this method extremely sensitive for distances at protein level dimensions . fret determined using _METHOD_ lifetime imaging microscopy is independent of protein concentration but very sensitive for the local microenvironment of the fluorophores . in fret flim the _METHOD_ lifetime of the donor molecule is reduced in presence of an acceptor molecule nearby since energy transfer to the acceptor will introduce an additional relaxation path from the excited to the ground state of the donor . the fret efficiency is given by e where is the _METHOD_ lifetime of the donor in the presence of acceptor and is the _METHOD_ lifetime of the donor alone . selective surface observation fret flim was performed on a leica tcs x equipped with a water immersion objective . in sso fret flim the confocal spot is positioned perpendicular to the pm of the root epidermal cells . in this configuration it was possible to observe signals from the pm whilst largely omitting signals from underlying organelles such as the cortical _LOCATION_ . a mhz tunable supercontinuum laser was used to excite _METHOD_ and mcherry at nm and nm respectively . _METHOD_ emission was detected using an internal hybrid detector with ps time resolution and collected in a spectral window of nm for _METHOD_ and nm for mcherry provided by an acousto optical beam splitter . the signal output from the hyd was coupled to an external time correlated single photon counting module for acquiring flim data . typical images had x pixels and time channels per pixel with an acquisition time of seconds per image . from the time resolved _METHOD_ intensity images the _METHOD_ decay curves were calculated for each pixel and fitted with either a mono or double exponential decay model using the spcimage software . fitting was performed without fixing any parameters . fret flim analysis provided _METHOD_ intensity as well as false colored _METHOD_ lifetime images . the raw data was subjected to the following criteria to analyze and omit false positive negatives in the _METHOD_ lifetime scoring minimum photon count per pixel of photons goodness of fit and _METHOD_ lifetime range of ps . for data analysis we set pixel binning at to have sufficient number of photons per pixel required for accurate _METHOD_ lifetime analysis . in addition a numerical evaluation of the observed _METHOD_ lifetime values and interaction pixels was determined by exporting the fitted data from spcimage into a phyton written script which calculates the number of pixels that adheres to the above mentioned fitting criteria . the fraction of ips was established by applying a _METHOD_ lifetime threshold as a percentage of the total number of pixels . this threshold corresponding to a fret efficiency of about was used and only pixels with _METHOD_ lifetimes below this interaction threshold were collected as ips . sequence data from this article can be found in
