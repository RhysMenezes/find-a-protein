boron uptake in arabidopsis thaliana is mediated by nodulin like intrinsic protein a boric acid channel that is located preferentially on the soil side of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ in root cells . however the mechanism underlying this _PROTEIN_ localization is poorly understood . here we show that the _PROTEIN_ localization of in epidermal and endodermal root cells is mediated by the phosphorylation of thr residues in the conserved tpg repeat in the n terminal region of . although substitutions of ala for three thr residues in the tpg repeat did not affect _PROTEIN_ diffusion in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ these substitutions inhibited endocytosis and strongly compromised the _PROTEIN_ localization of _METHOD_ . consistent with this the _PROTEIN_ localization was compromised in subunit mutants of the clathrin _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . the thr to ala substitutions did not affect the boron transport activity of _METHOD_ in xenopus laevis oocytes but did inhibit the ability to complement boron translocation to shoots and rescue growth defects in mutant plants under boron limited conditions . these results demonstrate that the _PROTEIN_ localization of is _PROTEIN_ by clathrin mediated endocytosis is dependent on phosphorylation in the tpg repeat and is necessary for the efficient transport of boron in roots .
to identify amino acid residues required for the _PROTEIN_ localization of we first compared the localization of nips in arabidopsis . previously and _PROTEIN_ were reported to be localized primarily in the pm whereas _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were located both in the pm and in intracellular _LOCATION_ most likely the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . to compare localization in the same cell types without the influence of native _METHOD_ fused proteins were _PROTEIN_ under control of the promoter in the mutant throughout this study . in epidermal cells _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ were localized _PROTEIN_ in the pm . _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ were localized in both the pm and intracellular compartments presumably in _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ were localized in intracellular compartments . we next investigated whether _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ showed _PROTEIN_ localizations in the pm by comparing their signals with those of a lipophilic styryl dye considered to stain the pm in a nonpolar manner . the _METHOD_ signals of _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ were clearly _PROTEIN_ toward the soil side in epidermal cells . by contrast the localization of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ showed only a weakly _PROTEIN_ localization in the optical longitudinal section . signal intensities from different positions in the longitudinal optical section are affected by the reduction of light penetration of the tissue . it should also be noted that the degree of reduction is dependent on wavelength . indeed when pm markers _METHOD_ and mcherry _PROTEIN_ were _PROTEIN_ under control of the _PROTEIN_ promoter in the same root _METHOD_ signals showed slightly more _PROTEIN_ distribution toward the soil side than mcherry signals . therefore we also used cross sections to evaluate _PROTEIN_ localization . again the localizations of _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ were clearly _PROTEIN_ whereas that of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was weakly _PROTEIN_ . to evaluate the _PROTEIN_ localization quantitatively we defined the _PROTEIN_ index _PROTEIN_ as follows . in longitudinal optical sections of arabidopsis roots the _PROTEIN_ represents the ratio of _METHOD_ signals normalized by signals of the soil side half versus the stele side half _PROTEIN_ . in the cross sections the _PROTEIN_ represents the ratio of _METHOD_ signal intensity of the soil side versus the stele side portions _PROTEIN_ . therefore a _PROTEIN_ of represents a nonpolar localization with an equal amount of protein in the two halves/portions . the _PROTEIN_ values for _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ were and and those of _PROTEIN_ were and respectively showing preferential localization on the outermost soil facing side of the root cells . by contrast the _PROTEIN_ value for _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was and the _PROTEIN_ value was . these values were lower than those for _METHOD_ but still > representing a weak _PROTEIN_ localization favoring the soil side . to examine whether this weak _PROTEIN_ localization of _PROTEIN_ is common for _LOCATION_ proteins in the pm of epidermal cells we observed and quantified the localization of several pm markers normally expected to be nonpolar . for this purpose _METHOD_ tagged a small hydrophobic protein with two potential transmembrane domains _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ a plant specific snare with one tmd and _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ a water channel were _PROTEIN_ in the mutant under the control of the promoter . as with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ these pm markers showed reduced signals from the soil side to the stele side in the transverse pm domain compared with the signals and the _PROTEIN_ values were . in cross sections intensities of the _METHOD_ signal were higher in the soil side pm domain and _PROTEIN_ values were to values that were similar to those of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . the _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusions showed weak _PROTEIN_ in the cortical cells even under the control of the promoter . thus the _PROTEIN_ values of _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in the epidermal cells are likely underestimates . in addition to _METHOD_ fused pm markers mcherry _PROTEIN_ under control of the _PROTEIN_ promoter and _PROTEIN_ mcherry under control of the camv promoter also showed weakly _PROTEIN_ localization in epidermal cells in the cross section . these results suggest that weak _PROTEIN_ localization toward the soil side is an inherent feature of _LOCATION_ proteins on the pm of the epidermal cells . for simplicity we classify _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ as general pm markers in this study . considering the high sequence similarity in the central region from the first to the sixth tmds and the lower conservation in the _LOCATION_ n and c terminal regions among the nips we hypothesized that the n or the c terminal region of is probably responsible for the _PROTEIN_ localization . to test this we generated three chimeric constructs by swapping the corresponding n terminal region c terminal region and the tmd containing central region from and _PROTEIN_ and tagged them with _METHOD_ at the n terminus . the chimera _METHOD_ in which the c terminal region of was replaced with that of _PROTEIN_ showed _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ values of and respectively . the chimera _METHOD_ in which the tmd containing central region of was replaced with that of _PROTEIN_ showed _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ values of and respectively . these values were significantly higher than those for _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . by contrast the chimera _METHOD_ in which the nt of was replaced with that of _PROTEIN_ was localized in the pm in a manner similar to the general pm markers with _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ values of and respectively . these results indicated that the n terminal region of was required for the _PROTEIN_ localization . we then investigated whether the n terminal region of was sufficient to confer _PROTEIN_ localization on either its homolog _PROTEIN_ or the water channel _PROTEIN_ . for this we generated chimeric constructs by replacing the nt region of _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ with that of and we then tested the localization of the respective proteins in the mutant . the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in which nt of _PROTEIN_ was replaced with that of showed a clear _PROTEIN_ distribution with _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ values of and respectively . likewise the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in which nt of _PROTEIN_ was replaced with that of also displayed clear _PROTEIN_ localization with _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ values of and respectively . these values were significantly higher than those of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ or _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ indicating that the n terminal region of is sufficient to establish _PROTEIN_ localization of aquaporin homologs . although the amino acid sequences of the n terminal regions of arabidopsis nips vary there is a characteristic pattern in and _PROTEIN_ that is not present in other nips in arabidopsis the tpgtpgtpg sequence at positions to of and the tpgtpg sequence at positions to of _PROTEIN_ . os and zm the rice and maize orthologs of arabidopsis respectively are boric acid channels . alignment of their n terminal regions showed that they share the tpgtpg/a sequence . tpgtpg/a or similar sequences in the n terminal region were identified in homologs in various plant species . to test the importance of this conserved sequence in _PROTEIN_ localization we analyzed the localization of _METHOD_ variants in which or amino acids from the n terminus were deleted . the _METHOD_ variant which retains the tpg repeat showed _PROTEIN_ localization although _PROTEIN_ were lower than that of the wild type construct . the _METHOD_ variant which does not contain the tpg repeat showed significantly lower _PROTEIN_ values than those of the wild type and the variant although the _PROTEIN_ values were a little higher than those of general pm markers . these results show that the tpg repeat is required for the _PROTEIN_ localization of . the _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ variants were observed in punctate structures in cells in addition to the pm . to test whether a significant proportion of the variants was transported to endosomes and the _LOCATION_ we imaged the cells after dark treatment . in the dark _METHOD_ in the _LOCATION_ is relatively resistant to degradation . following a dark treatment for h a large fraction of _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ variants was observed in the _LOCATION_ suggesting that the n terminal amino acid sequence is important for retaining the protein in the pm . we focused on the thr residues in the conserved tpg repeat because these have been predicted to be phosphorylation sites . to investigate phosphorylation of these residues a polyclonal antibody was generated against an artificial peptide of the n terminal region containing three phospho thr residues . _METHOD_ variants in which either one or all three thr residues at positions and/or were substituted by ala were _PROTEIN_ in the mutant under control of the promoter . for immunoblotting we prepared immunoprecipitated samples containing _METHOD_ wild type and variants to reduce nonspecific binding . using an anti _METHOD_ antibody _METHOD_ wild type and variants were detected as bands at and kd . considering the predicted molecular _METHOD_ of _METHOD_ and that the functional form of aquaporins is a tetramer we suggest that these bands include monomer dimer trimer tetramer and unknown modified _METHOD_ . using the phospho thr antibody these _METHOD_ of wild type _METHOD_ protein were detected whereas those of the variant were not . the wild type signals disappeared after lambda phosphatase treatment indicating that the antibody recognized _METHOD_ in which the tpg repeat is present in a phosphorylated state . the _METHOD_ and proteins were detected prominently but less efficiently than wild type proteins whereas the variants were not . these results indicate that is phosphorylated at conserved thr residue in vivo and that thr is especially important in this respect . it should be noted that this approach does not unambiguously determine the phosphorylated thr residue in the tpg repeat in the wild type because ala substitution has the potential to affect the phosphorylation of neighboring thr residues . to assess whether thr residue phosphorylation was involved in the _PROTEIN_ localization of in the pm we investigated both the localization of the phosphomimetic mutant _METHOD_ in which thr residues at positions and were replaced with asp and the localization of the nonphosphorylatable mutant _METHOD_ in epidermal cells . the localization pattern of _METHOD_ was similar to that of wild type _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ whereas _METHOD_ showed a marked loss in _PROTEIN_ localization _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . these results indicate the importance of the thr residues in the tpg repeat for the _PROTEIN_ localization . we next investigated the effects of substitution in cell types other than epidermal cells . in transgenic plants with relatively strong _PROTEIN_ we detected the _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ in mature endodermal cells . as reported previously the signal was localized exclusively on the soil side pm domain due to blocked diffusion in both the apoplast and the pm by the _PROTEIN_ strips . wild type _METHOD_ was observed only on the soil side pm domain decorated with whereas the variant was observed in both the soil side and the stele side pm domains in the endodermis . imaging of the cross section supported this . these results suggested a common mechanism regulating the _PROTEIN_ localization of in epidermal and endodermal cells independent of the presence of a diffusion barrier _PROTEIN_ in the pm . we also investigated the localization of the single ala substituted variants and . each ala substitution affected _PROTEIN_ localization to a different degree . the variant showed the lowest _PROTEIN_ although still higher than the triple substitution variant . together with the finding that and variants but not the variant were detected by the phospho thr antibody these results suggest a correlation between phosphorylation status and the degree of _PROTEIN_ localization . to examine whether thr residue phosphorylation was also important for the _PROTEIN_ localization of _PROTEIN_ we focused on and residues predicted to be putative phosphorylation sites according to the phosphat database . in contrast to the _PROTEIN_ localization of wild type _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ the variant lost its _PROTEIN_ localization . the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ values were and which were similar to those obtained with the general pm markers . similar to the case of single substitutions of these thr residues with ala affected the _PROTEIN_ localization of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ to differing extents . these findings indicate the common importance of conserved thr residues in the tpg repeats for _PROTEIN_ localization of and _PROTEIN_ in the pm . next we investigated time dependent changes in the localization of newly synthesized _METHOD_ under control of the promoter and the utr by transferring plants from high to low boron conditions . the utr of helps to regulate mrna degradation depending on boron conditions . the signals of wild type _METHOD_ in the pm were detectable after h under low boron conditions and the pattern was already _PROTEIN_ at this point . the intensity of wild type _METHOD_ on the soil side but not on the stele side increased continuously for h. by contrast the intensity of _METHOD_ increased on both sides and showed consistently weak _PROTEIN_ localization for h . these results support our findings that phosphorylation of the thr residues in the conserved tpg repeat is important in establishing the _PROTEIN_ localization of . _PROTEIN_ localization in the pm can be generated and _PROTEIN_ by _PROTEIN_ trafficking including secretion and endocytic recycling and/or retention in specific _LOCATION_ domains . to examine the effects of phosphorylation on the dynamics of within and around the pm we performed _METHOD_ recovery after photobleaching analyses on the soil side pm surface of root epidermal cells . to inhibit de novo synthesis of _METHOD_ we applied cycloheximide at min prior to the frap analyses . we confirmed that chx treatment inhibited the new synthesis of _METHOD_ effectively . in the frap analysis wild type _METHOD_ and the variant showed comparable _METHOD_ recovery up to min . we then examined the _METHOD_ recovery at the center and periphery of the bleached area . the rates of recovery at min were significantly lower at the center than at the periphery for both _METHOD_ and proteins . these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ diffusion contributed significantly to _METHOD_ recovery of the wild type _METHOD_ and proteins under these experimental conditions . to further compare the _PROTEIN_ diffusion of wild type _METHOD_ and the variant we used sodium azide together with chx for min prior to frap analysis . blocks hydrolysis by the mitochondrial _PROTEIN_ and thus is used as an energy inhibitor . under these conditions endocytosis of was inhibited effectively compared with the control condition . to estimate the rate of _PROTEIN_ diffusion precisely at the pm surface changes in the signal ratios for a region around and precisely at the bleached region in the presence of chx alone or in combination with were calculated . the signal ratio x/y was not affected significantly by treatment and showed no significant difference at any time point between the wild type _METHOD_ and proteins . these results indicated both that the rate of _PROTEIN_ diffusion in the pm was similar for the wild type _METHOD_ and proteins and that the impact of recycling is of little significance at least within min . thus it _METHOD_ likely that phosphorylation of the thr residues in the tpg repeat is not involved in retention in a pm domain . to assess whether thr residue phosphorylation was involved in vesicle trafficking we used bfa an inhibitor that enables the visualization of internalized pm proteins by inhibiting their recycling to the pm . to reduce accumulation of de novo synthesized proteins we treated roots with chx for min and then with bfa and chx for min . consistent with a previous report bfa caused the formation of aggregates containing _METHOD_ in root epidermal cells . the rate of intracellular accumulation of _METHOD_ protein was increased from to by bfa treatment in the presence of chx . pretreatment with chx did not _PROTEIN_ the accumulation of _METHOD_ significantly in cells compared with treatment with bfa alone suggesting that _METHOD_ in the aggregates is transferred _PROTEIN_ from the pm . by contrast the variant accumulated little in the bfa induced aggregates whereas _METHOD_ was accumulated in the aggregates and the rate of intracellular accumulation increased from to by bfa treatment . these results suggest that phosphorylation of the thr residues in the tpg repeat accelerated the endocytosis of . clathrin mediated endocytosis is a major endocytic pathway in arabidopsis . a heterotetrameric _PROTEIN_ protein complex _PROTEIN_ which is conserved in eukaryotes is important for clathrin mediated endocytosis in arabidopsis . to determine whether clathrin mediated endocytosis contributed to the _PROTEIN_ localization of _METHOD_ in the pm we investigated the localization of _METHOD_ in t dna insertion mutants of the subunit of the _PROTEIN_ complex _PROTEIN_ . in the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants _METHOD_ did not accumulate significantly in bfa induced aggregates in root epidermal cells indicating a low rates of endocytosis . the patterns of _METHOD_ localization in the epidermal cells of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants showed a strongly compromised _PROTEIN_ distribution with _PROTEIN_ values of and and _PROTEIN_ values of and respectively . these results demonstrate that clathrin mediated endocytosis is required for _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ localization of in the pm . to investigate the physiological significance of the _PROTEIN_ localization of on plant growth we tested whether the mutation affected the boric acid transport activity of . for this we injected crnas of wild type _METHOD_ and the variant into xenopus laevis oocytes to conduct a boric acid uptake assay . we also used crna of _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ which has a different type of aromatic/arginine selectivity filter from and _PROTEIN_ and thus is not expected to transport boric acid effectively . identical amounts of crnas were injected into the oocytes and similar _METHOD_ levels were observed in the pm . the oocytes were incubated in mbs buffer containing mm boric acid for min and the boron concentration was analyzed by inductively coupled _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ oocytes accumulated and fold higher boron contents than water injected controls and the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ oocytes respectively . as expected the boron contents of oocytes with wild type _METHOD_ and did not differ significantly indicating that substitution of the thr residues did not disturb boron transport activity . we then investigated the physiological significance of the _PROTEIN_ localization in transgenic arabidopsis plants . it was reported previously that the _METHOD_ construct did not fully complement the growth defects of the mutant plant under boron limitation probably due to low _PROTEIN_ levels . thus we tested the _METHOD_ construct containing a utr and the genomic sequence of from the start codon to the end of the utr and its variant introduced into a background . we measured the mrna levels and protein levels based on _METHOD_ signal intensities in homozygous lines with single insertions . for growth analysis we selected three lines of _METHOD_ wild type and two lines of _METHOD_ with similar mrna and _METHOD_ levels . we also selected two lines with higher _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ . these lines showed _PROTEIN_ and localization patterns of wild type _METHOD_ and in epidermal cells and mature endodermal cells similar to the patterns in the lines containing the cdna construct . using these lines we characterized complementation of growth of the mutant by _METHOD_ variants under low boron conditions . when boron in the medium was increased from to col plants showed improved root and shoot growth . the plants also showed growth improvement with increased boron supply whereas the growth was retarded severely versus col even at boron as reported previously . under these conditions transgenic lines _PROTEIN_ wild type _METHOD_ developed similar or slightly longer primary roots and similar or slightly heavier shoot weights relative to col indicating full complementation . by contrast the _METHOD_ variant did not fully complement the growth defects of the mutant . at boron the primary root lengths and shoot fresh weights of _METHOD_ lines were to and only to respectively relative to col . at boron the primary root lengths and shoot fresh weights of _METHOD_ lines reached levels similar to those of col although lines and still showed significantly lower values . the lines with higher _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ did not grow better than the lines with moderate _PROTEIN_ . in summary the wild type _METHOD_ protein was able to complement fully the growth defects of the mutant whereas the nonphosphorylatable variant was not . to examine the physiological significance of the _PROTEIN_ localization on boron transport a tracer experiment was conducted using transgenic plants with similar _PROTEIN_ levels of wild type _METHOD_ and the variant . plants grown hydroponically with enriched boric acid were divided into two pools . one was incubated with enriched boric acid for h and the other was harvested as a control . the concentration in each sample was determined by icp _METHOD_ and transported into the shoot during the h period was calculated as a function of root weight . the amount of transported to the shoot in col during the h period was about times higher than that in the mutant and the amount in the transgenic lines with wild type _METHOD_ was to higher than in col . this was likely caused by higher _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ mrna relative to endogenous . in the transgenic lines with _METHOD_ transport was to lower than in the col . together these results indicate that the _PROTEIN_ localization of supported the efficient transport of boron in roots under low boron conditions .

sequence was amplified using col genomic dna as a template and was digested with hindiii and xbai . this promoter fragment was ligated with the digested to generate the _METHOD_ destination vector .
