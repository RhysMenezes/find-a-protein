nucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolases hydrolyze di and triphosphate nucleotides but not monophosphate nucleotides . they are categorized as e type _PROTEIN_ have a broad divalent cation requirement for activation and are insensitive to inhibitors of f type p type and v type _PROTEIN_ . among the seven ntpdases identified in arabidopsis only apyrase _PROTEIN_ and apyrase _PROTEIN_ have been previously characterized . in this work either _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ tagged with c terminal green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ driven by their respective native promoter can rescue the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double knockout _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ successfully and confocal microscopy reveals that these two arabidopsis apyrases reside in the _LOCATION_ apparatus . in saccharomyces cerevisiae both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ can complement the _LOCATION_ localized mutant rescuing its aberrant protein glycosylation phenotype . in arabidopsis microsomes of the wild type show higher substrate preferences toward udp compared with other ndp substrates . loss of function arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ mutants exhibit reduced microsomal udpase activity and this activity is even more significantly reduced in the loss of function _PROTEIN_ mutant and in the _PROTEIN_ rna interference technology repressor lines . microsomes from wild type plants also have detectable gdpase activity which is significantly reduced in _PROTEIN_ but not _PROTEIN_ mutants . the _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ constructs in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ dko plants can restore microsomal udp/gdpase activity confirming that they both also have functional competency . the cell walls of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and the rnai silenced lines all have an increased composition of galactose but the transport efficiency of udp galactose across microsomal _LOCATION_ was not altered . taken together these results reveal that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are _LOCATION_ localized nucleotide diphosphatases and are likely to have roles in regulating udp/gdp concentrations in the _LOCATION_ lumen .
since ntpdases have been reported to have various localizations within the cell and play a variety of functional roles at these different locales we investigated the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ using genomic clones with c terminal _METHOD_ fusions . previous reports had shown that pollen lacking both _PROTEIN_ is infertile thus _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ dko mutants can not be obtained . c terminal _METHOD_ fusion constructs comprising either _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ were stably transformed into either _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plants . the rescued transformants were screened using untranslated region specific primer sets that can distinguish native _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ from the apy _METHOD_ inserts . these lines were initially screened for the presence of t dna insertions in both the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ loci . thus segregation of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transformants should follow a mendelian inheritance and display a segregation ratio between _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ and t dna inserts _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in the generation . native _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ mrna could not be detected by reverse transcription pcr in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ dko rescue lines containing the apy _METHOD_ constructs . no segregation of t dna alleles occurred in the generations providing further genetic evidence that the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion constructs can rescue the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ dko plants through proper function and correct localization . the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ dko seedlings _PROTEIN_ either _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ show no discernible phenotype which is in agreement with the absence of a visual phenotype in the single _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ mutants and also supports the notion that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ play redundant roles in arabidopsis . attempts to fuse _METHOD_ to the n terminus of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ failed to complement _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ dko lines suggesting the importance of the n terminal region for proper function/localization . the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ dko plants containing either _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ showed similar punctate structures . the cis _LOCATION_ marker mcherry and the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ specific marker aquaporin _PROTEIN_ mcherry were each stably transformed into both proapy apy _METHOD_ rescue lines to aid visualization and confirm the identity of these punctate structures . the signal from both _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ dko background co localized with the cis _LOCATION_ marker indicating their functional residency in the _LOCATION_ apparatus . furthermore we also examined the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signal in pollen tubes where _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are abundantly _PROTEIN_ . the internal punctate signal is also observed . unfortunately the cis _LOCATION_ marker mcherry and the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ specific marker aquaporin _PROTEIN_ mcherry are driven by the promoter which is only weakly _PROTEIN_ in the pollen tubes . several pollen tubes were examined but no marker signals could be obtained to demonstrate marker co localization . confocal images obtained from both root and pollen tubes consistently showed internal punctuate structures and no signal could be discerned to support the localization of _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . immunoblot analysis of complemented _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ dko lines with antibodies against _METHOD_ was undertaken to ensure the integrity of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ constructs in these lines and to confirm the _LOCATION_ based _METHOD_ signal corresponded to the intact protein constructs . both total protein and microsomal fractions from complemented plants were examined . analysis of complemented lines resulted in a _METHOD_ specific signal that coincided with the predicted molecular weight of the heterologous proteins _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . the analysis also indicated that _PROTEIN_ appears to undergo n terminal processing after localization to the microsomal fraction . the yeast apyrases and are functionally characterized _LOCATION_ resident ndpases which exhibit protein glycosylation and cell wall phenotypes when disrupted . in order to investigate the functional roles of the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ proteins in the _LOCATION_ apparatus we undertook a complementation analysis of the yeast and mutants . constructs containing either _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ were transformed into both and yeast cells . the _LOCATION_ enzyme _PROTEIN_ y _PROTEIN_ with four n linked _PROTEIN_ chains is an excellent marker enzyme to assess n glycosylation in yeast . as previously demonstrated _PROTEIN_ migrates faster in the background due to changes in n glycosylation when compared with wt yeast . the _PROTEIN_ of either _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ in the background could successfully revert this increased mobility suggesting that the _LOCATION_ localized _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ can functionally replace the yeast protein . a similar finding with only _PROTEIN_ was also recently observed using an identical approach . interestingly no mobility changes of _PROTEIN_ were observed in the yeast cells lacking the second yeast apyrase . to our knowledge this finding has not been previously reported even though this mutant is known to display a glycosylation phenotype . thus in order to determine whether either _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ was also able to replace function we investigated their ability to rescue another characterized phenotype exhibited by cells . the mutation results in an increased sensitivity to the aminoglycoside hygromycin b due to reduced protein glycosylation or defective cell wall biosynthesis . the sensitivity assay indicates that while cells are indeed sensitive to hygromycin b neither the _PROTEIN_ nor the _PROTEIN_ gene products could restore hygromycin b tolerance . taken together these results provide evidence that the _LOCATION_ localized _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are capable of functionally complementing the _LOCATION_ localized yeast apyrase but not the functionally similar yeast apyrase . in an attempt to determine whether _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ function in the plant _LOCATION_ apparatus we examined ndpase activity in the arabidopsis apyrase mutant lines using various ndp substrates . microsomes were isolated from day old arabidopsis seedlings and ndpase activity was measured using the malachite green assay . microsomal preparations of wt arabidopsis wassiewskija show higher enzyme activity towards udp when compared with the other ndp substrates . the loss of either _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ resulted in a significant reduction in udpase activity in microsomal _LOCATION_ preparations . the loss of _PROTEIN_ seemed to have a greater impact on udpase activity in comparison with the loss of _PROTEIN_ and it was equivalent to that measured in the rnai suppressor line _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . a lack of _PROTEIN_ in the single mutant did not significantly reduce gdpase activity compared with microsomes isolated from the wt supporting the notion that _PROTEIN_ may have a substrate preference for gdp when compared with _PROTEIN_ . the ndpase activities measured in the rnai suppressor line are similar to those measured in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . this result probably reflects the _PROTEIN_ that the rnai only reduces _PROTEIN_ in the _PROTEIN_ background and thus residual _PROTEIN_ protein may be present in microsomes from day old plants . both the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ lines can restore the udpase/gdpase activities in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ dko mutant lines and this result biochemically _METHOD_ the function of the fusion protein . there was no measured difference in microsomal adpase activity among the mutants examined . microsomes isolated from _PROTEIN_ plants and the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were also significantly reduced in cdpase activity . however this has little physiological significance since as far as we are aware there is no cdp substrate in the _LOCATION_ lumen . taken together these data indicate that both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ function as a udpase/gdpase . given the complementation in yeast and reduction of udpase/gdpase activities in apy mutants it has been proposed that a reduction in ndp hydrolysis and the reduction of substrates for the nucleotide sugar exchange between the _LOCATION_ lumen and the _LOCATION_ could result in reduced glycosyltransferase activity and lead to cell wall defects . we evaluated the monosaccharide composition of cell wall extracts from the three apyrase mutant lines . overall the monosaccharide content of cell wall extracts from the mutant lines was not altered with the exception of galactose which was significantly higher in all arabidopsis apyrase mutant backgrounds . consequently we sought to investigate the udp galactose transport efficiency in _LOCATION_ enriched _LOCATION_ fractions of the rnai suppression line . this line exhibits a drastic growth phenotype due to the inhibition of both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . unexpectedly udp galactose transporter rates in microsomes isolated from week old seedlings of the line revealed that udp galactose transport was similar to that measured in the wt .
