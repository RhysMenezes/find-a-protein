potassium homeostasis is essential for diverse cellular processes although how various cation transporters collaborate to _PROTEIN_ a suitable k required for growth and development is poorly understood . the arabidopsis genome contains numerous cation proton antiporters which may mediate k transport however the vast majority of these transporters remain uncharacterized . here we show that _PROTEIN_ has a role in k acquisition . _PROTEIN_ suppressed the sensitivity of yeast mutant cells defective in k uptake . uptake experiments using as a tracer for k demonstrated that _PROTEIN_ mediated high affinity k uptake in yeast and in plant cells with a km of and respectively . functional green _METHOD_ protein tagged versions localized to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ of both yeast and plant . seedlings of null _PROTEIN_ mutants were sensitive to k deficiency conditions whereas overexpression of _PROTEIN_ reduced the sensitivity to k deficiency . collectively these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ mediates relatively high affinity k uptake although the mode of transport is unclear at present . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is induced in roots during k deficient conditions . these results indicate that one role of _PROTEIN_ is to promote k uptake into plants when k is limiting in the environment .
in a family of chx members phylogenetically separated into five subclades _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ along with _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ compose subclade iii . none of these subclade iii transporters has been experimentally characterized . interestingly rice chx transporters related to subclade iii have not been identified suggesting monocots lack these transporters . to study the function of _PROTEIN_ reverse transcription pcr was used to clone the _PROTEIN_ cdna . previous studies revealed that _PROTEIN_ is highly _PROTEIN_ in pollen grains . therefore total rna extracted from arabidopsis pollen grains was used to amplify the _PROTEIN_ coding sequences using gene specific primers . the _PROTEIN_ cdna consists of nucleotides and a predicted polypeptide containing amino acids . the closely related _PROTEIN_ cdna comprises nucleotides which could encode a protein with amino acids . the _PROTEIN_ cdna and deduced protein revealed substantial similarities to other atchx transporters _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ shows the highest identity and similarity with _PROTEIN_ confirming they are products of an ancient chromosomal segmental duplication . in contrast _PROTEIN_ shares identity and similarity with _PROTEIN_ identity and similarity with _PROTEIN_ . the deduced _PROTEIN_ protein contains predicted transmembrane domains . _PROTEIN_ does not contain a predicted organelle targeting sequence and the c terminal region did not show substantial similarity to proteins of known functions . computational analysis clearly indicated _PROTEIN_ has similar topology with the other atchx transporters . we detected a growth change in a yeast mutant _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . lacks several functional k transporters including _PROTEIN_ tok and the endomembrane is very sensitive to low k . can only grow in medium with high levels of exogenous k . we confirmed that the yeast strains grew normally in medium supplemented with mm kcl whereas vector controls were not able to grow in the medium with low k . _PROTEIN_ of coding an inward rectifying arabidopsis k channel suppressed the hypersensitivity of to lower k . surprisingly yeast mutant cells _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ grew on medium containing low k in a similar manner to _PROTEIN_ cells suggesting that _PROTEIN_ has a role in acquiring k . to determine whether _PROTEIN_ could directly alter k content in yeast cells _PROTEIN_ vector _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were grown in synthetic medium with mm kcl and then subjected to ion analysis using inductively coupled _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ spectroscopy . the resulting accumulation profile of several elements was determined in these yeast strains . as shown in figure k content in and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ cells was significantly higher than the vector controls . interestingly p levels were also significantly higher in the and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ cells whereas the other ions were not different than the controls . thus an increase in yeast growth caused by _PROTEIN_ is accompanied by k accumulation . to further characterize _PROTEIN_ we _PROTEIN_ the transporter in yeast strains lacking only functional and _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ and restored growth of mutants at low k when compared to vector controls . for both and the difference between controls and both and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ cells was most pronounced at ph . to further test _PROTEIN_ function in k uptake we _PROTEIN_ the full length cdna in the yeast mutant strain and measured k uptake using radioactive rubidium as a tracer . for simplicity we assumed that mimics k influx and _PROTEIN_ directly tested this assumption . we analyzed uptake as a function of time in vector controls and cells _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or the k channel . to identify experimental conditions under which the initial rate of k uptake could be measured time course analysis of k uptake was performed at mm and mm external k . under both conditions uptake was linear for at least min and both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ cells had significantly higher k uptake rates compared to vector controls . yeast cells _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ had higher k uptake at low k concentrations compared to _PROTEIN_ cells whereas at mm k _PROTEIN_ cells demonstrated increased uptake compared to _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ cells . kinetic analysis was performed for k uptake by yeast cells _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or . initial uptake rates were plotted as a function of external k concentration . k uptake by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ yeast was near maximum at below mm indicating high affinity k uptake . uptake in _PROTEIN_ yeast did not show saturation up to mm k indicating a lower affinity for k . after subtracting the k uptake rate from vector controls reciprocal plots for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ yeast cells showed a km for k of and vmax of nmol cells . given that mediated k uptake did not show saturation in the substrate range measured we were unable to estimate a km for . to establish that rb uptake by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ cells is an accurate indicator of k uptake kinetics we measured rb uptake at min in assay solutions containing and mm of _PROTEIN_ and kcl . the uptake rates were virtually identical in the k and rb containing uptake solutions an indicator that rb flux is mimicking k uptake . _PROTEIN_ mediated k uptake assays at mm k was blocked by cesium and na . cs inhibited the high affinity uptake of k significantly at concentrations above mm . similarly k uptake in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ yeast cells was inhibited when greater than mm nacl was present . these results suggest that na and cs block k transport by competing for the same cation binding site . cs inhibits k uptake through most k channels and some other transporters . early studies demonstrated that k uptake by plant roots is inhibited by millimolar concentrations of nacl . to probe the mode of _PROTEIN_ mediated k uptake in yeast we tested the effect of ph and _PROTEIN_ cyanide m chlorophenylhydrazone . _PROTEIN_ mediated uptake at external k was higher at ph relative to ph . furthermore cccp a protonophore reduced k uptake . glc had little to no effect indicating that energy from _PROTEIN_ metabolites was not limiting . these results suggest that k uptake is dependent on a ph gradient . to determine the subcellular localization a fusion of _PROTEIN_ with _METHOD_ at the c terminus _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was constructed . the function and localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was tested in yeast . the addition of _METHOD_ did not abolish the function of _PROTEIN_ although the fusion protein showed weaker ability to restore yeast growth than _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ . in yeast _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was predominantly localized peripherally consistent with _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ localization and in contrast to the uniform cytoplasmic labeling in cells _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . in plant cells _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was transiently _PROTEIN_ under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus promoter in tobacco and onion epidermal cells . when imaged by confocal microscopy the localization pattern of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was markedly different from that of soluble _METHOD_ . a maximal projection image of several confocal optical sections of cells _PROTEIN_ soluble _METHOD_ revealed an extensive network of cytoplasmic strands which is characteristic of cytoplasmic localization . on the other hand _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ cells displayed intense _METHOD_ confined to the cell periphery . maximal projection images of a series of confocal optical sections revealed uniform _METHOD_ labeling along the cell surface and the absence of any _METHOD_ strands . these features are strongly indicative of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ localization of _PROTEIN_ . to exclude the possibility that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ localized to the cell wall onion cells were plasmolyzed by treatment with m suc . the _METHOD_ in the plasmolyzed cells detached from the cell wall confirming that the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signal was not from the cell wall or the apoplastic space between the cells . our plasmolysis experiment also allowed us to distinguish between _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and tonoplast labeling . in fully differentiated cells such as the onion inner epidermal cells used here a large central _LOCATION_ typically pervades a large portion of the cell leaving only a thin layer of cytoplasm compressed toward the edge of the cell . this often makes it difficult to distinguish whether _METHOD_ signal originates from the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ tonoplast or cytoplasm . we therefore imaged regions of the cell where we could readily visualize the cytoplasm . in a plasmolyzed onion cell _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ a slightly _PROTEIN_ region of the cytoplasm could be seen using bright field optics . a corresponding _METHOD_ image showed that _METHOD_ signal was uniformly distributed within this cytoplasmic domain . in contrast _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ cells showed intense _METHOD_ originating from a thin layer along the outer edge of the cytoplasm confirming _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ but not tonoplast localization . microarray and preliminary promoter driven gus results suggest that _PROTEIN_ like other atchx genes is _PROTEIN_ during pollen development . to more systematically characterize _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ we monitored _PROTEIN_ using rt pcr and _PROTEIN_ promoter driven gus activity . using northern analysis _PROTEIN_ showed little or no _PROTEIN_ in seedlings given a variety of ionic stresses including increased and _PROTEIN_ levels of na k and . using rt pcr we confirmed microarray results that _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ weakly in several plant tissues including roots . using rt pcr to determine _PROTEIN_ in seedlings we showed that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ could be detected d after plants were depleted of k . when plants were exposed to higher levels of k _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ could be detected in seedlings after d but _PROTEIN_ appeared to dissipate at day and beyond . to verify the _PROTEIN_ results promoter driven gus activity was determined . due to low _PROTEIN_ levels in vegetative tissues _PROTEIN_ activity could only be reproducibly measured in pollen when plants were grown on standard medium . when k was limiting _PROTEIN_ root _PROTEIN_ increased compared to lines grown in normal medium . _PROTEIN_ promoter gus _PROTEIN_ and rt pcr data indicated _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is enhanced in response to _PROTEIN_ k conditions . to study the function of _PROTEIN_ in plants we obtained two independent t dna insertional lines for _PROTEIN_ . homozygous lines were identified and the positions of the t dna insertions were confirmed by sequencing . using rt pcr no _PROTEIN_ transcripts could be reverse transcribed from total rna isolated from the mutant flowers . the _PROTEIN_ lines showed no obvious morphological or growth defects compared to control plants under standard growth conditions . additional attempts to alter _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were made by constitutive _PROTEIN_ of the orf in arabidopsis . in the lines pcr analysis showed augmented basal level of native gene _PROTEIN_ . despite the increased amount of _PROTEIN_ transcripts in these lines no change in plant growth or development was detected when the plants were grown in standard conditions . the _PROTEIN_ of k homeostasis is important for stress responses . the observations that the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ was induced in seedlings grown under low k conditions and that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in yeast mediated k transport suggested that _PROTEIN_ may function in k uptake during k deficiency . under standard growth conditions _PROTEIN_ mutants and seedlings grew similarly to control lines . however when these lines were germinated and grown on low k medium at varying ph values _PROTEIN_ lines displayed obvious growth phenotypes when compared to controls . specifically the _PROTEIN_ lines grew more slowly and appeared to have more leaf chlorosis and bleaching . the sensitivity of _PROTEIN_ lines to limited k is obvious at low ph however this sensitivity is not ph dependent as some sensitivity is also observed at ph . measurements of total chlorophyll and fresh weight analysis in these lines reflect the growth differences . that is the _PROTEIN_ lines displayed reduced chlorophyll content and _METHOD_ . the transgenic lines that _PROTEIN_ high levels of _PROTEIN_ were more robust than control lines in these growth conditions . uptake kinetics of and wild type seedlings were directly analyzed by measuring time and concentration dependent uptake into roots of k starved plants . the initial uptake of was linear in all lines up to min with uptake being dramatically higher for the _PROTEIN_ lines than control mutant lines . concentration dependent uptake was subsequently measured at min intervals at different external k concentrations . uptake rates for revealed a significant difference between vector control and lines at low k concentrations . the _PROTEIN_ mutants showed uptake at mm k lower than controls . at high k concentrations the difference in uptake kinetics could not be resolved between vector control and the lines with enhanced _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . the influx at mm k was similar in all lines tested . in _PROTEIN_ lines uptake was slightly reduced compared to controls when k was limiting but was similar to controls at higher k levels . to attempt to measure the uptake rate of k by _PROTEIN_ in plants the difference between the uptake rates of vector controls and was measured . a plot of the difference in uptake rates as a function of k concentration approximates a saturable system with a km of and vmax of nmol . we measured uptake in lines under different ph conditions and in the presence of the protonophore cccp . in a manner similar to the yeast cells _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ optimal uptake was measured at acidic ph conditions and the protonophore inhibited k uptake in these whole plant experiments . results suggest k uptake is dependent on a ph or electrochemical gradient .

arabidopsis biological resource center . two _PROTEIN_ homozygous lines were screened from t dna insertion lines _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . in both lines the t dna was inserted in the last exon of the

gcggccgcgcgtttaccgagatcaatggtagtgaaaccttct . the pcr product was sequenced and ligated into the yeast pugpd _METHOD_ vector at spei and noti sites . the resulting constructs contained the _PROTEIN_

yeast _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ plasmid dna as a template . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was amplified with a forward primer gcggccaaatcggccatggagctttcgatgtttggcagag and a reverse primer
