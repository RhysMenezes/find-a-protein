to understand how the direction of root growth changes in response to obstacles light and gravity we characterized an arabidopsis thaliana mutant wavy growth _PROTEIN_ whose roots show a short pitch pattern of wavy growth on inclined agar medium . the roots of the _PROTEIN_ mutant bent with larger curvature than those of the wild type seedlings in wavy growth and in gravitropic and phototropic responses . the cell file rotations of the root epidermis of _PROTEIN_ in the wavy growth pattern were enhanced in both right handed and left handed rotations . _PROTEIN_ encodes a protein belonging to the bud emergence family with a transmembrane domain at the n terminus and an hydrolase domain at the c terminus . _PROTEIN_ analyses showed that mrna of _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ strongly in adult plant roots and seedlings especially in the root tip the cell elongation zone and the stele . our results suggest that _PROTEIN_ is not involved in sensing environmental stimuli but that it negatively regulates stimulus induced root bending through inhibition of root tip rotation .
the _PROTEIN_ mutant displayed enhanced wavy root growth on inclined agar surfaces as described previously . we measured the wave tangent angle wavelength and growth rate of the wild type roots _LOCATION_ and the _PROTEIN_ roots . the roots of the _PROTEIN_ mutant had larger wave tangent angles and shorter wavelengths than the roots of the wild type seedlings . the growth rates of the mutant roots were similar with that of the wild type . these results indicate that the mutation at the _PROTEIN_ locus causes an abnormality in the root bending in response to the touch stimulus at the root tip but that it does not cause severe defects in the root growth . citation reported that hydrotropic curvature was increased in the roots of _PROTEIN_ . we tested whether this mutant also shows abnormalities in response to gravity and light . when we examined the gravitropic response by inverting the agar medium the wild type roots showed gradual bending and a large radius of curvature whereas the _PROTEIN_ roots showed sharp bending and a small radius . when we changed the root direction from vertical to horizontal the initial root curvature was larger in _PROTEIN_ than in the wild type in both horizontal positions . when we examined the phototropic response by unilateral irradiation with white light for h a slight but obvious enhancement of curvature was observed by irradiation from both the right and left in _PROTEIN_ . thus angles of root curvature in _PROTEIN_ were larger than those in the wild type in positive gravitropism and negative phototropism as well as in positive hydrotropism . photosensors for phototropism are phototropin blue light receptors . gravity sensors for gravitropism may sense the sedimentation of starch filled amyloplasts . the sensing _METHOD_ for light gravity touching and moisture may all be different . thus these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ is a common regulator that suppresses root bending in response to various environmental stimuli but not a specific regulator that responds to touching or moisture . a previous study suggested that the wavy growth pattern in roots is caused by periodic reversal of rotation of the root tip . during wavy growth right turn root bending is accompanied by left handed rotation of the root tip and left turn root bending is accompanied by right handed rotation . furthermore the root tip rotation could be traced as the cell file rotation of the root epidermis . to observe any effect of the _PROTEIN_ mutation on the root tip rotation we quantified angles of cell file rotation and root bending in segments of root within the first three and a half waves . both variables were greater in _PROTEIN_ than in the wild type . as citation described previously the right handed cell file rotation occurred before the left turn root bending and the left handed cell file rotation occurred before the right turn root bending in all waves of root growth except in the first bend of a _PROTEIN_ seedling . these results suggest that the enhancement of cell file rotation causes the increase of root bending in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . recent studies indicate that the organization of cortical microtubules is involved in the regulation of root tip rotation . to determine how cortical microtubules array in root epidermal cells of wild type and _PROTEIN_ seedlings showing wavy growth pattern whole mount immunostaining experiments were performed on those seedlings . in both of _PROTEIN_ and wild type roots the cortical microtubule arrays appeared to be mostly transverse throughout the entire _PROTEIN_ and distal elongation zones there were no noticeable differences between roots of wild type and _PROTEIN_ . next we examined the sensitivity of roots to drugs that affect microtubules by measuring the root slanting angles on agar medium in the vertical position . when to propyzamide a microtubule destabilizing chemical was added to the growth medium wild type roots showed an exaggerated rightward slant through left handed cell file rotation as described previously . the _PROTEIN_ roots also slanted rightward but less than the wild type in both the absence and the presence of propyzamide indicating a slight resistance to the drug . when and taxol a microtubule stabilizing chemical was added to the growth medium wild type roots showed a reduced rightward slant . _PROTEIN_ showed a higher sensitivity to taxol and taxol caused a slightly leftward root slant in which the root tip of the mutant seedlings sometimes showed right handed rotation . a reversal of the trend in root slanting was observed by taxol at as compared with and in both seedlings and root slanting angle of _PROTEIN_ was smaller than that of the wild type at as well as at or . although taxol inhibited germination and caused growth defects in many seedlings surviving seedlings showed a strong rightward slant in wild type and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . reduction of rightward slant by and taxol and enhancement of rightward slant by taxol at or more were also seen by citation with wild type seedlings . to understand the molecular nature of the _PROTEIN_ gene product we determined the gene structure using a map based cloning procedure . _PROTEIN_ was mapped to a kb region of chromosome with a region that includes putative genes from arabidopsis genome initiative loci _GENE_ to . all annotated genes in this region of the _PROTEIN_ mutant were sequenced only one base change was found in _GENE_ . a full length cdna corresponding to the open reading frame of _GENE_ was obtained from the arabidopsis biological resource center 's cdna catalog . the noncoding region of this gene was confirmed by the rapid amplification of cdna ends method . normal wavy growth of roots was recovered in a transgenic _PROTEIN_ mutant named _PROTEIN_ hincii which carried a genomic dna fragment containing _GENE_ . the _PROTEIN_ mutant carrying a t dna insertion in _GENE_ of the wassilewskija ecotype showed a shorter wave pitch than that of the ws wild type seedlings although the pitch was weaker than that of the _PROTEIN_ mutant . we concluded that the gene is _PROTEIN_ . wavy root growth pattern in wild type seedlings _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants and a transgenic _PROTEIN_ mutant with restored function _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ contains eight exons and encodes a predicted protein of amino acid residues with a molecular _METHOD_ of kd . the _PROTEIN_ gene possesses a non sense mutation at residue suggesting that the _PROTEIN_ mutation is null . the _PROTEIN_ protein possesses a signal peptide with a transmembrane domain at its n terminus and an hydrolase domain in the middle of the protein . blast searches revealed that _PROTEIN_ belongs to the gene family in the hydrolase superfamily . it is a unique gene in the arabidopsis genome but homologous genes were identified in oryza sativa schizosaccharomyces pombe saccharomyces cerevisiae escherichia coli neurospora crassa drosophila melanogaster and mus musculus . the gene of s. pombe is registered as a suppressor of the mutants of s. cerevisiae in the s. pombe gene database but its molecular function has not been identified yet . the _PROTEIN_ pattern of the transcripts of _PROTEIN_ was revealed by rna gel blot analysis . stronger _PROTEIN_ was detected in young seedlings and in roots of adult plants than in _METHOD_ leaves and flowers . the _PROTEIN_ pattern in roots was observed using a green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ reporter gene . when the _METHOD_ fused _PROTEIN_ protein _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was induced by the _PROTEIN_ gene promoter it complemented the _PROTEIN_ mutation and thus functioned normally . the root tip including the cell elongation zone and the stele showed the brightest _METHOD_ _METHOD_ in this transgenic _PROTEIN_ mutant although _METHOD_ was observed in all root tissues and slight _METHOD_ was detected in the hypocotyls and cotyledon . the _PROTEIN_ in the root tip seemed to be consistent with the function of _PROTEIN_ in regulating root tip rotation . because _PROTEIN_ has a putative transmembrane domain in its n terminal region it _METHOD_ to be a _LOCATION_ protein . when the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ proteins was observed _METHOD_ was detected at the surface of cells and inside of cells except in the _LOCATION_ or _LOCATION_ . gaps in _METHOD_ were observed in the apoplast suggesting that the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein does not diffuse into the apoplast . to determine whether _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was localized to the cell wall we treated roots with m mannitol to plasmolyze the cells . confocal images of these roots showed a considerable amount of _METHOD_ within the cell as _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ pulled away from the cell wall during plasmolysis indicating that _METHOD_ was not localized to the cell wall and that _PROTEIN_ was not secreted from cell to apoplast . to know whether the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ proteins are localized in cytoplasm or _LOCATION_ we prepared the soluble fraction and the crude microsomal fraction from whole seedlings and roots of seedlings _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and analyzed both fractions by a immunoblot with an anti _METHOD_ antibody . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was detected as an kd band in the crude microsomal fraction but not in the soluble fraction prepared from both whole seedlings and roots . preparations of the soluble fraction were confirmed by anti glutamine synthetase antibody which reacts with the kd polypeptide of _LOCATION_ gs protein in arabidopsis . from the results of observation of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and immunoblot analysis we concluded that the _PROTEIN_ proteins localize in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ of inner _LOCATION_ compartments but not in cytoplasm _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and apoplast .
