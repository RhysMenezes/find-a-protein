signal transduction involving heterotrimeric g proteins is universal among fungi animals and plants . in plants and fungi the best understood function for the g protein complex is its modulation of cell proliferation and one of several important signals that are known to modulate the rate at which these cells proliferate is d _PROTEIN_ . arabidopsis thaliana seedlings lacking the subunit _PROTEIN_ of the g protein complex have altered cell division in the hypocotyl and are d _PROTEIN_ hypersensitive . with the aim to discover new elements in g protein signaling we screened for gain of function suppressors of altered cell proliferation during early development in the _PROTEIN_ mutant background . one _PROTEIN_ dependent suppressor designated _PROTEIN_ for suppressor of g protein _PROTEIN_ restored to wild type the altered cell division in the hypocotyl and sugar hypersensitivity of the _PROTEIN_ mutant . consistent with _PROTEIN_ localization _PROTEIN_ is found at the highest steady state level in tissues with active cell division and this level increases in hypocotyls when grown on d _PROTEIN_ and sucrose . _PROTEIN_ is shown here to be a _LOCATION_ localized hexose transporter and acts genetically with _PROTEIN_ in early seedling development .
to identify new components required in g protein signaling in plants we screened seedlings for dominant extragenic alleles that suppress the etiolated hypocotyl and hook phenotypes of the null mutant _PROTEIN_ . eight independent suppressor candidates designated here as sgb for suppressor of g beta were found to display to different degrees both an elongated hypocotyl and a closed hook after d in darkness relative to _PROTEIN_ . one of these sgb is the subject of this study . as shown in figure a and b the short hypocotyl of _PROTEIN_ at d was partially suppressed in the hemizygous _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ background whereas the _PROTEIN_ hook phenotype was completely suppressed . in addition the larger rosette size of _PROTEIN_ was also suppressed but other _PROTEIN_ phenotypes such as leaf shape were only partially suppressed and others such as silique shape were not suppressed at all by the _PROTEIN_ mutation . the _PROTEIN_ line contained a single copy t dna insertion located at position of chromosome kb to the start codon of _GENE_ . four genes were found within a kb region flanking the insertion . therefore to identify which gene was activated the steady state mrna levels of these four adjacent genes were analyzed using rt pcr . only _GENE_ showed an enhanced steady state mrna level compared with the parent _PROTEIN_ . to confirm that the dominant suppressor phenotypes was a consequence of overexpression at this locus the full length cdna encoded by the _GENE_ locus was placed under the control of the cauliflower mosaic viral promoter and transformed into the parent _PROTEIN_ mutant . hypocotyl and hook phenotypes of _PROTEIN_ mutant were restored to wild type in three independent transgenic lines overexpressing the _GENE_ cdna in _PROTEIN_ . the d _PROTEIN_ hypersensitivity of _PROTEIN_ hypocotyls was also rescued when _GENE_ was overexpressed . these results support our conclusion that enhanced _PROTEIN_ of _GENE_ causes suppression of the _PROTEIN_ phenotypes in _PROTEIN_ and based on these we designate _GENE_ as _PROTEIN_ . seedlings that were hemizygous for the _PROTEIN_ locus and heterozygous for the _PROTEIN_ allele _PROTEIN_ exhibited the wild type phenotype . because _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ seedlings behaved similarly to wild type seedlings this result suggests that _PROTEIN_ only affects hypocotyl and hook formation in the _PROTEIN_ loss of function background . consistent with this observation overexpression of the _PROTEIN_ cdna _PROTEIN_ in wild type seedlings did not confer an obvious phenotype in these assays nor did it alter morphology or development of adult plants . the underlying cause for restoration of the short hypocotyls of _PROTEIN_ seedlings to wild type hypocotyl lengths when _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ is elevated is due to an increase in cell number . there were on average cells along a file on the hypocotyl epidermis of wild type seedlings in contrast to cells for _PROTEIN_ hypocotyls similar to values published by citation . seedlings _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ under the promoter have files comprised of cells . the maximum and minimum cell lengths for all three genotypes are similar indicating that the cell division defect occurring during early development in _PROTEIN_ is restored by _PROTEIN_ . taken together the dependence of a loss of _PROTEIN_ for a phenotype when _PROTEIN_ is overexpressed suggests that _PROTEIN_ lies on the same genetic pathway as _PROTEIN_ . it also suggests that _PROTEIN_ acts as a positive regulator of _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ protein composed of amino acids has a predicted molecular _METHOD_ of kda and an isoelectric point of for an unphosphorylated form and for a predicted fully phosphorylated form . the majority of protein topology servers return a prediction for _PROTEIN_ having transmembrane domains a central _LOCATION_ loop and n and c terminal internal domains and two sugar transport signatures . a tm topology is typical of sugar transporters in human yeast and plants . _PROTEIN_ is most similar to a _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ transporter in plants to the human _PROTEIN_ transporter and to a putative transporter in budding yeast . _PROTEIN_ belongs to a large superfamily of known and putative hexose transporters with at least members in arabidopsis . this superfamily designated monosaccharide h transporter like _METHOD_ proteins _LOCATION_ is one of the largest gene families in arabidopsis with most members having unknown functionality . the exceptions are the known sugar transporters _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ that have essential function throughout plant development . the large family of arabidopsis _METHOD_ like proteins is composed of several clades . one large clade _PROTEIN_ is composed of known and putative _PROTEIN_ transporters . other clades contain putative inositol transporters anion transporters polyol transporters and _PROTEIN_ transporters . _PROTEIN_ is a member of the _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ transporter clade _PROTEIN_ composed of four uncharacterized proteins and is annotated as such solely on protein similarities to a spinach _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ translocator . only one member of _PROTEIN_ has a predicted chloroplast transit peptide . _PROTEIN_ has a higher probability for mitochondrial targeting than for chloroplast targeting but neither prediction score strongly supports a mitochondrial or _LOCATION_ subcellular location . _PROTEIN_ is similar to putative and known hexose transporters in yeast and humans . yeast has sugar transporters that fall into three major clades . a comparison of arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ to the saccharomyces cerevisiae protein database with a cut off e value of places among a group of unknown proteins and it is most closely related to and . cladistic analyses using a cluster model places _PROTEIN_ within the most similar _PROTEIN_ transporters in humans . human is the most similar to . heterologous _PROTEIN_ in oocytes in conjunction with dog uptake assays support the predicted hexose transport activity of _PROTEIN_ . the oocyte assay is a well established in vivo assay system for heterologous hexose transport . _PROTEIN_ levels of _PROTEIN_ in oocytes after mrna injection was demonstrated by immunoblot analysis using antisera directed to a amino acid peptide located near the amino terminus of _PROTEIN_ which is predicted to be surface exposed and _LOCATION_ . _PROTEIN_ was detected in oocytes injected with sense mrna but not the negative or positive controls . two negative controls were incorporated . as shown in figure dog uptake into oocytes injected with antisense _PROTEIN_ rna and _PROTEIN_ rna containing a frame shift mutation were not significantly different from oocytes injected with buffer alone and were at values similar to the nontransport controls reported by citation on a per oocyte basis . in contrast _PROTEIN_ sense rna resulted in fold greater transport than controls and at values similar to the positive control injection of a constitutively active _PROTEIN_ transporter . complementation analysis with _PROTEIN_ tested with several yeast single and multiple deletion mutations in known and putative hexose transporters was performed . however despite extensive effort rescue of either strong or weak phenotypes of hexose transporter null lines was not convincing . a t dna insertion mutant allele of locus _GENE_ designated here as _PROTEIN_ in the col ecotype was isolated from the salk institute sequence indexed insertion mutant collection . the t dna insertion is located in the highly conserved region of the penultimate exon . semiquantitative pcr revealed the absence of full length _PROTEIN_ transcript although a truncated transcript was detectable . neither the absence nor excessive amount of _PROTEIN_ had an effect on _PROTEIN_ gene _PROTEIN_ . the transcript levels of genes encoding the other known g protein elements _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or the _PROTEIN_ interacting protein _PROTEIN_ were not changed by altered _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ . similar to the _PROTEIN_ mutant d old etiolated _PROTEIN_ seedlings exhibited short hypocotyls and open hooks . the _PROTEIN_ allele conferred phenotypes that behaved recessively . to confirm that the mutant phenotypes were caused by the t dna insertion at the _PROTEIN_ locus we genetically complemented _PROTEIN_ mutant plants . transgenic _PROTEIN_ plants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or the fusions _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or _PROTEIN_ gus displayed wild type phenotypes . the observation that the _PROTEIN_ mutant had deficiencies in early development similar to the _PROTEIN_ mutant suggests an associate role of _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ in cell division and elongation . moreover similar morphological phenotypes implicate _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in the same pathway of g protein signaling consistent with the results from the _PROTEIN_ gain of function mutants . to test the genetic relationship further epistasis analysis was performed between the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ alleles . the d old seedlings of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant grown on sucrose showed a similar phenotype to _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ with short hypocotyls and open hooks neither an additive nor synergistic phenotype was observed . together the recessive _PROTEIN_ phenotype and the epistasis between loss of function alleles of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ suggests that _PROTEIN_ acts as a positive regulator of _PROTEIN_ in the early seedling development . _PROTEIN_ rna was detected in various tissues of wild type plants by rt pcr . consistent with these rt pcr results an analysis of gene _PROTEIN_ profiling data deposited in the genevestigator database showed that _PROTEIN_ mrna was detectable in a wide range of tissues . no single treatment or tissue type tested to date in the public database displayed altered _PROTEIN_ rna levels over controls or average by more than two fold . of particular interest d _PROTEIN_ altered _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ only fold . therefore to elucidate the differences in steady state levels of _PROTEIN_ protein in various cells due to possible posttranslational control we transformed both _PROTEIN_ and col with a construct containing the _PROTEIN_ promoter driving the _PROTEIN_ cdna translationally fused with the gus gene . overexpression of _PROTEIN_ gus in the _PROTEIN_ mutant conferred wild type hypocotyl length and hook angle indicating that the _PROTEIN_ gus fusion protein is active . high steady state levels of _PROTEIN_ protein were observed for various sink tissues both in the presence and absence _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ protein . the apical and _PROTEIN_ root _METHOD_ displayed high _PROTEIN_ levels . _PROTEIN_ protein was also high in anthers/pollen embryos and specific cells of the siliques including the abscission zone of the floral organs . dividing but not mature leaf cells contained high _PROTEIN_ levels . a specific set of newly formed cells of vascular traces in expanding leaves was shown to contain _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ gus pattern greatly overlaps the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ pattern . because _PROTEIN_ may function in _PROTEIN_ dependent sugar sensing and because most signal networks contain feedback regulation the effect of d _PROTEIN_ on _PROTEIN_ protein level in planta was tested using an _PROTEIN_ gus translational fusion driven by the _PROTEIN_ promoter . etiolated seedlings grown without sugars _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in root _METHOD_ . application of d _PROTEIN_ greatly increased the steady state level of the _PROTEIN_ gus fusion protein and its distribution pattern . the d _PROTEIN_ induced increase was observed predominantly in the hypocotyl and root apices . similarly sucrose increased the steady state level of _PROTEIN_ gus but with less efficacy . sorbitol inositol and fructose did not alter the levels or distribution pattern of _PROTEIN_ over the no sugar control . arabidopsis plants _PROTEIN_ an _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ translational fusion driven by the _PROTEIN_ promoter enabled the determination of the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ . we first experimentally ruled out the predicted mitochondrial and/or _LOCATION_ localizations of _PROTEIN_ . root tip cells of transgenic plants bearing _PROTEIN_ cyan _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ and counterstained with mitotracker a _LOCATION_ specific _METHOD_ dye revealed that mitochondrial _METHOD_ did not colocalize with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . in addition chloroplast containing mesophyll cells _PROTEIN_ an _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein reveal no overlap between chlorophyll and _METHOD_ . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ driven by the native promoter in wild type and _PROTEIN_ null backgrounds showed that _METHOD_ was observed in root tissues where the _PROTEIN_ promoter is active . moreover the _METHOD_ imaging was observed to be in multiple punctate compartments within each cell reminiscent of the size distribution and number of _LOCATION_ apparatus in plant cells . moreover the dynamics of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ movement also matched published _LOCATION_ dynamics . imaging a _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ construct in plants lacking functional _PROTEIN_ demonstrated that the localization of _PROTEIN_ was not dependent on _PROTEIN_ as the _METHOD_ patterns in figure b and c are identical . finally because the _PROTEIN_ steady state levels are higher in hypocotyl cells when grown on d _PROTEIN_ we examined hypocotyl epidermal cells and found the same punctate pattern for _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ localization as in root cells . to confirm that the observed _METHOD_ was the _LOCATION_ apparatus bfa was used . bfa has been shown in plants to disrupt the integrity of _LOCATION_ stacks resulting in the fusion of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and the _LOCATION_ stacks and the formation of so called bfa compartments . after treatment with brefeldin a the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was observed to change from punctate structures representing the _LOCATION_ to both a diffuse _METHOD_ representing the fused _LOCATION_ compartments and larger punctate structures representing the newly formed bfa compartments . z stack reconstruction imaging of the young leaf epidermal cells of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ plants before and after bfa treatment clearly demonstrate the effect of bfa on _PROTEIN_ localization . higher magnification imaging of an individual bfa compartment demonstrated that the larger bfa compartments were made up of fused smaller compartments presumably individual _LOCATION_ stacks . figure is a three dimensional reconstruction from a z stack acquisition of control and bfa treated cells . bodipy bfa has been previously shown to label the _LOCATION_ complex in living cells . we used bodipy bfa to stain _LOCATION_ in arabidopsis seedlings _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ driven by the cauliflower mosaic virus promoter . in arabidopsis root hair cells _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ showed a predominant colocalization with bodipy bfa labeled _LOCATION_ stacks that were dispersed in the cytoplasm . under these conditions _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein was also associated with vesicles typically smaller than the _LOCATION_ stacks and that did not stain with bodipy bfa . to further elucidate the localization of _PROTEIN_ and to understand the nature of the small non _LOCATION_ vesicles we used arabidopsis seedlings _PROTEIN_ both _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ driven by the _PROTEIN_ promoter and the cis medial _LOCATION_ marker mannosidase _METHOD_ driven by the camv promoter . as shown using the bodipy bfa _LOCATION_ reporter _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was observed in _LOCATION_ as well as within rapidly moving small vesicles . interestingly the addition of d _PROTEIN_ caused within minutes a _PROTEIN_ in the smaller _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ labeled vesicles . as can be seen in figure nearly all the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ colocalizes with the _LOCATION_ marker after a low concentration of d _PROTEIN_ was applied . this redistribution was most apparent in the supplemental movies where the rates of movement of the smaller vesicles and the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ labeled _LOCATION_ were perceptively different . concomitant and commensurate with the d _PROTEIN_ induced _PROTEIN_ in the number of small vesicles containing _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ the _PROTEIN_ labeled _LOCATION_ compartments increased . this indicates that the _LOCATION_ is the predominant _PROTEIN_ compartment and further suggests that d _PROTEIN_ regulates the _PROTEIN_ trafficking between the _LOCATION_ and as yet unidentified small vesicle compartments . in summary four lines of evidence indicate that the predominant but not exclusive subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ is the _LOCATION_ apparatus the _PROTEIN_ compartment share the size morphology and dynamics of plant _LOCATION_ bfa reversibly causes the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ pattern to collapse into diffuse _LOCATION_ punctuate structures and the previously described bfa compartment derived from the _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ colocalizes with the _LOCATION_ stain bodipy bfa and _PROTEIN_ colocalizes with the cis medial _LOCATION_ enzyme mannosidase . moreover we have shown that _PROTEIN_ is found to various degrees depending on the conditions in smaller rapidly moving vesicles and that the addition of d _PROTEIN_ diminishes their abundance in the cortical region of the plant cell .
