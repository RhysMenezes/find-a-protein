to investigate the _LOCATION_ controlled _METHOD_ of cluster assembly in chloroplasts we selected arabidopsis thaliana mutants with a _PROTEIN_ content of photosystem i containing three clusters . one identified gene accumulation of photosystem _PROTEIN_ belongs to a previously unknown gene family with four defined groups _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ only found in _LOCATION_ genomes of vascular plants . all homologs contain two related motifs of amino acid residues that could potentially provide ligands for clusters . _PROTEIN_ is essentially required for photoautotrophic growth and levels of psi core subunits are below the limit of detection in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . unlike other arabidopsis psi mutants _PROTEIN_ fails to accumulate significant amounts of the outer antenna subunits of psi and psii and to form grana stacks . in particular _PROTEIN_ is essentially required for stable accumulation of other _LOCATION_ encoded and _LOCATION_ encoded cluster complexes within the chloroplast whereas cluster containing complexes appear to be unaffected . in vivo labeling experiments and analyses of polysome association suggest that translational elongation of the psi transcripts _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ is specifically arrested in the mutant . taken together our findings suggest that _PROTEIN_ is involved in the stable assembly of several cluster containing complexes of chloroplasts and interferes with translational events probably in association with _LOCATION_ nucleoids .
in a systematic screen for _LOCATION_ encoded _PROTEIN_ responsible for acclimation and _PROTEIN_ of psi biogenesis we identified arabidopsis mutants incapable of photoautotrophic growth . we selected mutants with visible phenotypes that exhibited an albinotic or pale phenotype and seedling lethality . mutant plants that were grown heterotrophically often survived indicating photosynthetic deficiencies as primary defects . all analyses were performed with plants grown in vitro . on sugar supplemented medium the otherwise albinotic _PROTEIN_ mutant showed a very pale and high chlorophyll _METHOD_ phenotype indicating substantial loss of chlorophyll and that absorbed light energy can not be used efficiently which is therefore dissipated as increased red chlorophyll _METHOD_ . the t dna induced _PROTEIN_ mutation of arabidopsis was selected because it caused a complete loss of psi activity . growth at photons was slower but leaf morphology and development were unaltered in _PROTEIN_ in comparison to wild type plants . under moderate light intensities of photons mutant plants bleached rapidly indicating increased light sensitivity . the light induced in vivo chlorophyll _METHOD_ measurements can serve as a sensitive tool to estimate the excitation state of psii reaction centers . the ratio of variable _METHOD_ to maximum _METHOD_ reflects the potential capacity of the photochemical reaction of psii . the _METHOD_ is quenched by the use of light energy measured at intensities of and photons . fv/fm reached levels of in _PROTEIN_ as compared with in the wild type indicating partial loss of psii capacity or a stimulated emission of psi antenna pigments that contribute to a higher minimum _METHOD_ with no effect on fv . at the lower light regime qp was reduced to in the mutant as compared with in the wild type . at still moderate light intensities of photons dramatic deficiencies were observed in qp processes in _PROTEIN_ . whereas wild type plants exhibited a qp of under steady state conditions _PROTEIN_ failed to quench most of the variable _METHOD_ . such a behavior is typical for mutants affected in electron transport processes independent of psii . this inference was confirmed by measuring the light induced redox kinetics of the psi pigment . under normal conditions is completely reduced in the dark and oxidized to its maximum level in selective psi light whereas under steady state conditions in heterochromatic light the redox state is adjusted somewhere in between . although the dual wavelength pulse amplitude modulated system was set at maximal sensitivity light induced redox changes were below the limit of detection in _PROTEIN_ indicating complete loss of psi function . in plants grown heterotrophically levels of chlorophylls were fold reduced in _PROTEIN_ as compared with wild type seedlings . the ratio of chlorophyll a to chlorophyll b was altered from in the wild type to in the mutant . the photosynthetic pigment absorbance spectra demonstrated that the typical maxima at and nm for chlorophyll a at nm for chlorophyll b and at nm for carotenoids were present in the mutant . the second derivative of the absorbance spectra showed a much broader carotenoid band at nm in _PROTEIN_ which is indicative of a relatively high carotenoid content and of an increased sensitivity to light . fluorometric studies at showed that the psii specific band at nm was present in the mutant and not shifted to shorter wavelengths . this indicates that psii reaction centers are present at normal levels relative to the outer light harvesting complex ii and that excitons can be efficiently transferred from lhcii to the inner psii antenna . the usually most abundant psi specific absorbance band at nm was reduced to a hardly detectable shoulder in the spectra of _PROTEIN_ . therefore it appears that psii complexes are functionally assembled whereas the whole psi complex including the outer antenna severely and specifically fails to accumulate in _PROTEIN_ . stationary protein levels were normalized by equal loading of mutant and wild type _LOCATION_ and soluble proteins of the chloroplast . immunological analysis of _PROTEIN_ revealed that _LOCATION_ encoded and _LOCATION_ encoded proteins of psii _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and cytochrome complex _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ accumulated to significant levels between and . amounts of the _PROTEIN_ synthase _PROTEIN_ and the soluble peth and pete proteins encoding ferredoxin nadp reductase and plastocyanin respectively were unaltered in _PROTEIN_ . by contrast only traces if any of the _LOCATION_ encoded and _LOCATION_ encoded intrinsic psi proteins _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ psad and _PROTEIN_ could be detected in _PROTEIN_ . levels of the peripheral antenna proteins of psi were strongly reduced in _PROTEIN_ amounting to for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and or less for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ as compared with those of the wild type confirming the conclusions deduced from _METHOD_ data . the inability of _PROTEIN_ to accumulate significant amounts of the four antenna proteins of psi contrasts findings on other known arabidopsis psi mutants because they are primarily and specifically affected in the accumulation of all core subunits but not to this extent of the outer antenna . remarkably the outer psii antenna proteins _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were also significantly reduced to < of the wild type . recent findings show that fe s cluster assembly is important for stable accumulation of psi and other proteins or complexes within the chloroplast . to investigate whether _PROTEIN_ has additional targets that participate in chloroplast biogenesis we studied the accumulation of several _LOCATION_ fe s cluster containing complexes and proteins . ferredoxin which contains a cluster is not affected in size or in abundance in _PROTEIN_ . by contrast the mutants have significantly reduced levels of cluster containing complexes like the ferredoxin thioredoxin reductase _PROTEIN_ and nad h dependent dehydrogenase . the deficiency in accumulation of clusters does not appear to be characteristic for mutants lacking psi because which is also missing the psi core complex shows normal levels of other chloroplast cluster proteins . the abundance and sizes of _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and all _LOCATION_ transcripts encoding psi proteins _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were identical in mutant and wild type plants as determined by rna gel blot analysis and by _PROTEIN_ profiling using macroarrays that were equipped with probes of all _LOCATION_ genes . transcript levels of the _LOCATION_ cab and rbcs genes which are well known to be significantly reduced when the functional state of the chloroplast is arrested at an early stage were unaltered as well in _PROTEIN_ . rna gel blot analysis demonstrates that the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ genes yield just a single prominent tricistronic rna of kb in arabidopsis . primer extension studies uncovered that the transcript terminus of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ tricistron is unaltered in _PROTEIN_ when compared with the wild type . therefore we conclude that the _PROTEIN_ mutant exhibits normal promoter usage integrity and abundance of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ transcripts . psi protein abundance could be limited by translational disturbances in the mutant . therefore pulse labeling of _LOCATION_ bound and soluble proteins of the chloroplast was performed with met in the presence of the cytoplasmic translation inhibitor cycloheximide . with the exception of one _LOCATION_ encoded protein of kd biosynthesis of other detectable soluble proteins in the stroma was unchanged in _PROTEIN_ . labeling of _PROTEIN_ synthase subunits and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was slightly increased in the mutant relative to the wild type control based on equal loading of radioactive label . incorporation of radioactivity into the psii proteins _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ was comparable to that in wild type but labeling of the chlorophyll binding proteins _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ was reduced . these data demonstrate the pleiotropy of the phenotype . as a control the labeling pattern of _PROTEIN_ was compared with that of another arabidopsis psi mutant accumulating only of the tricistronic _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mrna . the mutant specifically exhibits _PROTEIN_ levels of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ radiolabeling and similar to _PROTEIN_ increased incorporation of label into _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . a failure to radiolabel the psi core proteins _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ could reflect that the rates of translation of the two psi reaction center subunits are repressed in _PROTEIN_ . however it also remains possible that the synthesis of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ is unchanged in _PROTEIN_ but the proteins or the nascent chains are rapidly degraded during the time course of the experiment . if translation of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mrnas is perturbed in _PROTEIN_ changes in polysome association for the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ transcripts could be expected . polysomal loading was analyzed by sucrose density gradient centrifugation . the sizes and distribution of polysomes loaded with _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ transcripts did not differ in the mutant when compared with the wild type . however polysomes associated with tricistronic _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ transcripts were shifted to _PROTEIN_ sucrose concentrations suggesting a failure in the functional loading of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ transcripts with ribosomes in the mutant . to test whether initiation or elongation of translation is affected in _PROTEIN_ the translation inhibitor lincomycin that prevents reinitiation and forces previously initiated ribosomes to run off was applied to wild type and mutant plants h before polysome isolation . as expected the inhibitor caused banding of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mrnas at much lower sucrose concentrations in wild type whereas in _PROTEIN_ lincomycin induced a less prominent liberation of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ transcripts from ribosomes indicating that translational elongation is retarded in the mutant . lincomycin treatment of the mutant was as effective as in the wild type because _PROTEIN_ containing and rrna containing polysomes were shifted toward the top of the gradient to the same extent in both cases . therefore it appears that _PROTEIN_ is not needed for initiation but rather specifically for elongation of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ translation cofactor assembly during translation or targeting of the nascent chains to their right place . however the changes in the size of polysomes could also reflect an assembly mediated regulation of translation . the ultrastructure of the _PROTEIN_ was compared with that of three other psi specific mutants _PROTEIN_ and and the wild type . wild type chloroplasts showed a well developed _LOCATION_ system consisting of interconnected grana and a random distribution of starch grains . the _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ were to times smaller than those of the wild type and appeared to be swollen . the mutant _METHOD_ rudimentary _LOCATION_ consisting only of stroma lamellae and fails to accumulate grana stacks . this indicates that _LOCATION_ development is arrested at a very early morphological stage and distinguishes _PROTEIN_ from other psi mutants which form larger _PROTEIN_ swollen or unoriented grana stacks but only fragmentary stroma lamellae . the small size of the chloroplasts in _PROTEIN_ also explains the low level of chlorophyll based on the fresh weight . the _PROTEIN_ mutation segregated in a mendelian manner and was mapped between the two microsatellite markers _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ on the lower part of chromosome at position mb . neither known genes encoding _LOCATION_ ribosomal proteins nor psi genes map in this region suggesting that _PROTEIN_ encodes a novel protein . the kanamycin resistance conferred by the introduced t dna cosegregated with the mutant phenotype in analyzed segregants indicating that _PROTEIN_ is tagged by the insertion . the localization of _PROTEIN_ to the lower part of chromosome was confirmed by isolation and sequencing of the t dna left border and right border flanking regions by inverse pcr . using _PROTEIN_ and t dna right border probes for dna gel blot analyses confirmed a single t dna insertion that cosegregates strictly with the _PROTEIN_ mutation . the location of the insertion site close to the end of _PROTEIN_ at position mb of chromosome _PROTEIN_ is consistent with the mapping data . the full length cdna of _PROTEIN_ was isolated using a rapid amplification of cdna ends _PROTEIN_ approach . interestingly the _PROTEIN_ start codon is localized in the second exon . _PROTEIN_ of the full length _PROTEIN_ cdna under the control of the rna cauliflower mosaic virus promoter functionally complemented the mutant phenotype resulting in the development of fully green seedlings which grew photoautotrophically and showed all physiological chlorophyll _METHOD_ and redox characteristics which are typical for the wild type . _PROTEIN_ transcripts of kb could be detected in the wild type but were absent in _PROTEIN_ consistent with the t dna insertional inactivation of the _PROTEIN_ gene . because transcript abundance of _PROTEIN_ was very low even in the wild type the precise _PROTEIN_ levels of _PROTEIN_ were estimated by real time rt pcr using rrna for normalization . twelve day old dark grown wild type seedlings _PROTEIN_ of the light control . _PROTEIN_ in roots _METHOD_ siliques and flowers was and respectively relative to that found in leaves . although substantial transcript levels were already present in dark and in roots _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ appears to be stimulated during photomorphogenesis . this implies important roles of _PROTEIN_ in the dark and also in nonphotosynthetic tissues . in vitro synthesized _PROTEIN_ precursor proteins of kd were imported into chloroplasts and processed to a mature size of kd demonstrating the presence of a cleavable transit peptide even if no chloroplast target sequence was identified with any of the prediction _METHOD_ available in public databases . to sublocalize _PROTEIN_ within the chloroplast the _PROTEIN_ cdna was translationally fused to the green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ and transiently _PROTEIN_ in isolated protoplasts . the green _METHOD_ was found exclusively in chloroplasts consistent with the findings of the in organello experiments . although there is a diffuse _METHOD_ signal apparently throughout the stroma much of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion resided in distinct spots within the organelle . comparing the _METHOD_ induced by _METHOD_ with that induced by diamidino phenylindole stained cells indicates that the _METHOD_ labels of both samples overlapped . therefore _PROTEIN_ appears to be associated with _LOCATION_ nucleoids . the relative intensity of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and dapi _METHOD_ varied in the individual spots indicating that _PROTEIN_ has a higher affinity to a distinct fraction of nucleoids . it is important to note that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ association with nucleoids does not seem to reflect an unspecific aggregation of overexpressed protein because the compartmentalization was also apparent in chloroplasts with barely detectable _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and not observed with other highly _PROTEIN_ chloroplast targeted _METHOD_ fusions showing a uniform distribution . the _PROTEIN_ gene encodes a previously unknown protein and shows similarities to genes only found in vascular plants . the absence of similarities in the sequenced genomes of eubacteria archaebacteria or chlamydomonas indicates that the apo gene family evolved after the divergence of the green lineage or has been lost in related lineages . using public databases all attempts to identify sequence motifs or domains within _PROTEIN_ that are indicative of a function failed . because the instability index of _PROTEIN_ is computed to be the protein is classified to be unstable . according to structural predictions _PROTEIN_ consists of extensive random coiled and to a lesser extent of alpha helical and extended strand structures . the _PROTEIN_ protein contains amino acid residues and has a deduced molecular _METHOD_ of kd consistent with the size of in vitro translated _PROTEIN_ proteins . three additional homologous genes of unknown function _PROTEIN_ to _PROTEIN_ are present in the arabidopsis genome . interestingly each of the four apo proteins possesses an orthologous counterpart in the rice genome . therefore the apo gene family consists of four distinguishable groups that are present in both monocotyledonae and dicotyledonae . _PROTEIN_ to _PROTEIN_ show much fewer similarities in the n terminus than in the remaining part of the proteins indicating different localizations and/or functions . _PROTEIN_ is also predicted to be localized in the chloroplast . in rice _PROTEIN_ is computed to be present in the chloroplast as well whereas the arabidopsis protein is predicted to be localized in mitochondria . _PROTEIN_ is computed to represent a mitochondrial protein in both _METHOD_ . all members of the previously unknown apo gene family contain a amino acid residue spanning region with conserved cys his gly and acidic and basic amino acids . the highly conserved apo motif is duplicated at the c terminus . these two motifs are always separated from each other by a less conserved spacer that is also variable in length but in groups to contains one conserved met embedded within positively charged amino acid residues directly upstream of apo motif . a similar sequence is also present downstream of apo motif close to the c terminus in all groups . apo motif is followed by a short stretch containing positive charges in groups to . the highly conserved signature of both motifs in _PROTEIN_ which fits to all members of the apo gene family in vascular plants can be defined as c c gh c h x w d h x _PROTEIN_ e c g. the conserved cys in both motifs could provide ligands for tetranuclear fe s centers . several conserved differences between the two motifs could indicate different functions . for example both motifs apo and contain a conserved h in another position . two conserved r residues are present in apo motif and two k residues in motif . in addition apo motif contains conserved g vw yg and a residues which are not present in apo motif in any of the groups .
