_PROTEIN_ gene identification is a key regulator of lipid metabolism and signaling in mammals but its underlying _METHOD_ are unclear . disruption of cgi in either mammals or plants results in a significant increase in triacylglycerol suggesting that cgi activity is evolutionarily conserved . however plants lack proteins that are important for cgi activity in mammals . here we demonstrate that cgi functions by interacting with the peroxisomal abc _PROTEIN_ a protein that transports a variety of substrates into _LOCATION_ for their subsequent metabolism by oxidation including fatty acids and lipophilic hormone precursors of the jasmonate and auxin biosynthetic pathways . we also show that mutant cgi plants display changes in jasmonate biosynthesis auxin signaling and lipid metabolism consistent with reduced _PROTEIN_ activity in planta and that based on the double mutant cgi _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is epistatic to cgi in all of these processes . however cgi was not required for the _PROTEIN_ dependent breakdown of tag in germinated seeds . collectively the results reveal that cgi positively regulates many aspects of _PROTEIN_ activity in plants and that these two proteins function to coregulate lipid metabolism and signaling particularly in nonseed vegetative tissues . similarities and differences of cgi activity in plants versus animals are discussed .
to gain insight to the molecular function of cgi in plants we screened an arabidopsis cdna library using cgi as bait in a yeast two hybrid system and identified three strongly interacting proteins . sequencing of the respective prey plasmids revealed that one of the interacting proteins contained a polypeptide sequence corresponding to the c terminal amino acids of the peroxisomal transport protein _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ is known to play a number of important roles in plant lipid metabolism including the transport of fas into _LOCATION_ for breakdown by oxidation as well as uptake of several lipophilic hormone precursors including oxophytodienoic acid and indole butyric acid for their subsequent conversion via oxidation into biologically more active _METHOD_ namely jasmonic acid and indole acetic acid respectively . moreover disruption of _PROTEIN_ was previously shown to result in elevated accumulation of _PROTEIN_ and tag in vegetative tissues under certain physiological conditions . the general similarity of oil accumulation phenotypes in both cgi and _PROTEIN_ mutant plants suggested that cgi and _PROTEIN_ might function cooperatively in regulating lipid metabolism and signaling thus the relationships between cgi and _PROTEIN_ were investigated further . _PROTEIN_ is a full size abc transport protein that consists of two duplicated regions each of which contains six putative _LOCATION_ spanning domains followed by a _LOCATION_ exposed nucleotide binding domain composed of walker a and b motifs _PROTEIN_ . the fragment of _PROTEIN_ identified in the yeast two hybrid screen included the walker b motif of the second nbd which is a region known to be important for regulating the activity of _PROTEIN_ in planta . although we were unable to detect an interaction between cgi and full length _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in yeast cells using the two hybrid assay cgi could pull down full length _PROTEIN_ protein in coimmunoprecipitation assays in vitro . as such additional experiments were conducted to further characterize the interaction between cgi and the c terminal region of _PROTEIN_ . for instance cgi also was able to bind in the yeast two hybrid assay to the entire region containing both walker a and b motifs . however cgi did not bind the a region alone or to any region of . cgi also did not bind to a mutant version of b where the sequence was changed to match that of the _PROTEIN_ mutant where the c terminal amino acids of the _PROTEIN_ protein is replaced with a different sequence of amino acids due to a splice site mutation and which severely disrupts _PROTEIN_ activity in plants . by contrast the introduction of a point mutation into the b sequence which has only a mild effect on _PROTEIN_ activity in vivo and no detectable effect in vitro did not prevent interaction with cgi . the interaction of cgi and the b region of _PROTEIN_ also was supported by results from a complementary series of _LOCATION_ relocalization assays in plant suspension cultured cells whereby a green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ tagged version of cgi was coexpressed with various regions of _PROTEIN_ fused to the red _METHOD_ protein and a _LOCATION_ localization signal _METHOD_ . while coexpression of _METHOD_ cgi and _METHOD_ nls resulted in the _LOCATION_ localization of _METHOD_ cgi and _LOCATION_ localization of _METHOD_ nls as expected coexpression of _METHOD_ cgi with _METHOD_ nls fused to the _PROTEIN_ b region resulted in a portion of _METHOD_ cgi being relocalized to the _LOCATION_ due to protein protein associations . similar _LOCATION_ relocalization was observed when _METHOD_ cgi was coexpressed with _METHOD_ nls fused to the _PROTEIN_ b region harboring the minor mutation but not when _METHOD_ nls was fused to the b region containing the more extensive _PROTEIN_ mutation at the c terminus . taken together the results presented in figure demonstrate that cgi interacts specifically with the c terminal b region of _PROTEIN_ and that mutations in this sequence that are known to modulate the activity of _PROTEIN_ in vivo similarly modulate its interaction with cgi . the results presented in figure and in our earlier studies indicate that cgi is localized primarily to the _LOCATION_ in plant cells when analyzed in transient _PROTEIN_ assays and at early time points . on the other hand the observation that cgi interacts with the c terminal region of _PROTEIN_ which is oriented toward the _LOCATION_ in the context of the full length protein implies that cgi might localize also to _LOCATION_ . indeed as shown in figure transient _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ cgi in tobacco leaves using agrobacterium tumefaciens infiltration revealed that at early time points after infection the protein localized primarily to the _LOCATION_ but also was associated with _LOCATION_ that were labeled with the coexpressed peroxisomal _PROTEIN_ marker cherry _PROTEIN_ . at _PROTEIN_ times points after infection the majority of _METHOD_ cgi was associated with _LOCATION_ . in _PROTEIN_ peroxisomal associated _METHOD_ cgi often exhibited a _PROTEIN_ like _METHOD_ pattern that surrounded the cherry _PROTEIN_ labeled peroxisomal _PROTEIN_ suggesting that cgi was localized to the _LOCATION_ surface of the peroxisomal boundary _LOCATION_ . a similar peroxisomal _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ like _METHOD_ pattern was observed when _METHOD_ cgi was _PROTEIN_ in the absence of cherry _PROTEIN_ but not when _METHOD_ alone was coexpressed with cherry _PROTEIN_ . our working hypothesis is that cgi functions at least in part by positively regulating the transport activity of _PROTEIN_ . to test this hypothesis we analyzed wild type cgi _PROTEIN_ or cgi _PROTEIN_ mutant arabidopsis plants in a variety of physiological assays known to be dependent on _PROTEIN_ transport activity . first mechanical wounding of wild type plants induces the production of ja whose synthesis is believed by most to begin with the release of linolenic acid from galactolipids in the _LOCATION_ followed by a series of metabolic transformations that eventually produce opda . opda is transported into _LOCATION_ via _PROTEIN_ and converted to ja . in plants disrupted in _PROTEIN_ the amount of wound inducible ja was significantly reduced compared with the wild type consistent with a reduction in opda uptake by _PROTEIN_ . cgi mutant plants also displayed a reduction in wound inducible ja formation compared with the wild type although the phenotype was perhaps not as severe as in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . on the other hand the cgi _PROTEIN_ double mutant displayed a phenotype that was similar to _PROTEIN_ alone indicating that _PROTEIN_ was epistatic to cgi in these assays and consistent with the hypothesis that cgi functions in part by modulating the activity of _PROTEIN_ . measurement of gene _PROTEIN_ patterns in the mechanically wounded arabidopsis plants using quantitative rt pcr provided further insight to the functional relationships of cgi and _PROTEIN_ during stress response . for instance cgi _PROTEIN_ was stimulated fold in wild type plants in response to wounding but this increase was reduced by half in _PROTEIN_ mutant plants . similarly the _PROTEIN_ of allene oxide synthase _PROTEIN_ a wound inducible gene involved in metabolic transformation of linolenic acid into opda in the _LOCATION_ also was reduced moderately in both _PROTEIN_ and cgi plants and was reduced significantly in the cgi _PROTEIN_ double mutant plants . these results indicate that cgi is induced during the plant wounding response that this induction is dependent partially on _PROTEIN_ and that both cgi and _PROTEIN_ likely participate in amplifying the stress induced ja signaling pathway through feedback regulation at the transcriptional level . _PROTEIN_ also is required for the transport of the auxin iba into _LOCATION_ for its subsequent conversion to iaa which is a potent regulator of plant growth and development . inclusion of either iba or iaa in growth media represses root elongation of wild type arabidopsis plants but _PROTEIN_ mutant plants are resistant to the effects of iba due to reduced transport into _LOCATION_ for conversion to iaa . cgi mutant plants also displayed tolerance to iba but showed an intermediate phenotype between wild type and _PROTEIN_ mutant seedlings . moreover cgi _PROTEIN_ double mutant plants displayed a phenotype similar to the _PROTEIN_ mutant alone revealing an epistatic relationship of _PROTEIN_ to cgi in the auxin signaling pathway . similar inhibitory results were observed if the synthetic auxins dichlorophenoxybutyric acid or d which are similar to iba and iaa in that their conversion requires _PROTEIN_ were used in the root bioassays or if auxin sensitivity was measured using hypocotyl elongation assays . collectively these results demonstrate that auxin signaling pathways were similarly disrupted in at least two different organ types both of which require _PROTEIN_ transport activity for full biological activity . previous studies revealed that disruption of cgi or _PROTEIN_ resulted in a significant increase in tag content in plant leaves particularly for tag molecular species containing polyunsaturated fas . to directly compare changes in lipid content and composition we analyzed _PROTEIN_ abundance and individual tag molecular species in leaves of wild type _PROTEIN_ cgi and cgi _PROTEIN_ double mutant plants . as shown in figure disruption of either cgi or _PROTEIN_ resulted in an increase in _PROTEIN_ abundance in leaf mesophyll cells in comparison to the wild type . the abundance of _PROTEIN_ also was increased in the cgi _PROTEIN_ double mutant plants but the increase was no greater than that of either single mutant alone . lipidomics analysis of leaf lipids revealed that the tag pools in each mutant plant line were enriched in tag molecular species containing polyunsaturated fas including and . these data indicate that cgi and _PROTEIN_ likely operate on the same or similar biochemical pathway to limit tag accumulation in plant leaves particularly in _PROTEIN_ to accumulation of tags containing polyunsaturated fas and that loss of _PROTEIN_ and/or cgi activity results in enhanced tag formation perhaps due to reduced fa turnover . since _PROTEIN_ is known to play an essential role in turnover of fas derived from tags in germinated seeds we investigated whether cgi also was required for the breakdown of fas in support of postgerminative growth . as shown in figure _PROTEIN_ mutant seedlings were unable to establish unless suc was provided in the growth medium . however the cgi mutant plants could establish in the absence of suc similar to the wild type suggesting that tag and fa breakdown was not compromised in the mutant plants . measurement of fa content throughout seed germination and establishment confirmed that fas were indeed broken down at similar rates in both wild type and cgi mutant plants . taken together with the results described above it is apparent that cgi and _PROTEIN_ participate in regulating tag content in non lipid storing mesophyll cells of plant leaves but these functions apparently do not overlap in lipid storing cells of seeds .

at least one disrupted allele of cgi were identified by pcr based genotyping as described . plants homozygous for _PROTEIN_ were subsequently identified in the next generation by an inability of
