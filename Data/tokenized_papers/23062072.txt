gamete and embryo development are crucial for successful reproduction and seed set in plants which is often the determining _PROTEIN_ for crop yield . proline accumulation was largely viewed as a specific reaction to overcome stress conditions while recent studies suggested important functions of proline metabolism also in reproductive development . both the level of free proline and proline metabolism were proposed to influence the transition to flowering as well as pollen and embryo development . in this study we performed a detailed analysis of the contribution of individual proline biosynthetic enzymes to vegetative development and reproductive success in arabidopsis . in contrast to previous reports we found that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ synthetase _PROTEIN_ is not essential for sexual reproduction although _PROTEIN_ mutant plants were retarded in vegetative development and displayed reduced fertility under long day conditions . single mutant plants devoid of _PROTEIN_ did not show any developmental defects . simultaneous absence of both _METHOD_ resulted in pollen sterility while fertile egg cells could still be produced . _PROTEIN_ of reductase _PROTEIN_ was indispensable for embryo development but surprisingly not needed for pollen or egg cell fertility . the latter observation could be explained by an extreme stability of _PROTEIN_ activity which had a half life time of greater than weeks in vitro . _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ under the control of the endogenous _PROTEIN_ promoter was able to restore growth of homozygous _PROTEIN_ mutant embryos . the analysis of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ in planta supported an exclusively cytoplasmatic localisation of _PROTEIN_ . our results demonstrate that potential alternative pathways for proline synthesis or inter generation transfer of proline are not sufficient to overcome a defect in proline biosynthesis from glutamate during pollen development . proline biosynthesis through _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ is limiting for vegetative and reproductive development in arabidopsis whereas disruption of _PROTEIN_ alone does not affect development of non stressed plants .
two previous studies have described _PROTEIN_ t dna insertion lines as embryo lethal or conditionally embryo lethal and non fertile . to eliminate potential secondary mutations or ecotype specific effects we backcrossed the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ t dna insertion lines three and five times respectively to the col accession . in both lines the segregation pattern was consistent with a single t dna insertion and premature abortion of homozygous seeds . homozygous _PROTEIN_ mutant plants were then generated by in vitro cultivation of immature mutant seeds on _METHOD_ plates containing mm sucrose and mm proline . we observed that also application of mild salt stress to heterozygous _PROTEIN_ mutant plants allowed the formation of approximately homozygous and fertile seeds in vivo . most of the homozygous plants obtained in either way were phenotypically normal showing only reduced growth compared to wildtype plants . when kept in short day and low light conditions most homozygous _PROTEIN_ mutant plants completed a normal life cycle and produced viable seeds which enabled us to analyse development of _PROTEIN_ mutant plants in direct comparison to wildtype and _PROTEIN_ mutant plants . when grown in axenic culture homozygous _PROTEIN_ seedlings showed a growth defect that could be complemented by feeding with external proline or application of mild salt stress . at low mineral or sucrose concentrations _PROTEIN_ mutant seedlings frequently failed to establish autotrophic growth . in soil the rosettes of _PROTEIN_ mutant plants reached only of the size of wildtype plants an effect that was even more pronounced when no mineral fertiliser was applied . retarded growth of _PROTEIN_ mutants . a sixteen day old seedlings grown in sterile culture

the time of fertiliser application _LOCATION_ bars indicate sd of individuals . the size difference between _PROTEIN_ mutants and the wildtype was significant for all timepoints . with respect to floral transition _PROTEIN_ plants had fewer primary rosette leaves at the onset of bolting which was delayed by more than days under both short day and long day conditions . occasionally _PROTEIN_ mutant plants formed elongated or slightly rolled leaves and such plants mostly failed to produce seeds . cultivation in long day conditions increased the propensity of _PROTEIN_ mutant plants to form abnormal leaves and _PROTEIN_ the proportion of fertile plants . in infertile _PROTEIN_ flowers the anthers were collapsed and the _PROTEIN_ were elongated . fertility of mildly affected flowers could be restored by pollination with pollen from a different plant . in _PROTEIN_ mutants with stronger phenotypic abnormalities also malformations of the pistil and the stigma were observed extending to disturbances in floral organ identity and architecture of the whole inflorescence . such flowers could not be fertilised by cross pollination . defects of _PROTEIN_ mutants in reproductive development

potential influence of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ on growth and development also the knockout mutant line _PROTEIN_ was backcrossed three times to col and homozygous progeny was included in all experiments . contrary to the observations of _PROTEIN_ mutant plants did not show any deviations from the wildtype with respect to growth flowering time inflorescence architecture or fertility under non stressful cultivation conditions irrespective of the light period and the light intensity . during backcrossing heterozygous _PROTEIN_ mutant plants produced less than the expected sulfadiazine _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ resistant progeny . application of mild salt stress increased the mutant allele transmission in both _PROTEIN_ insertion lines presumably by induction of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . reciprocal crossing of heterozygous _PROTEIN_ to wildtype plants indicated that reproductive development is slightly impaired in both the male and the female germlines . transmission of _PROTEIN_ mutant alleles by self pollination and in reciprocal crosses with wildtype plants transmission of the _PROTEIN_ mutant alleles was determined by sulfadiazine _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ resistance of the progeny after selfing or reciprocal crossing of heterozygous _PROTEIN_ mutants with wildtype plants . a _PROTEIN_ wildtype allele _PROTEIN_ mutant allele _PROTEIN_ mutant allele . sd was calculated from three batches of seeds from individual parent plants . the expected frequency takes into account that homozygous _PROTEIN_ seeds are usually non viable in the presence of wildtype or heterozygous seeds in the same silique . indicates significant difference from the expected value . to get a deeper insight in the role of proline synthesis in reproductive development we also crossed the _PROTEIN_ mutant lines with the _PROTEIN_ mutant . surprisingly the frequency of _PROTEIN_ mutant alleles was much lower than expected among the progeny of _PROTEIN_ double heterozygous plants . transmission of the _PROTEIN_ allele after selfing of heterozygous plants dropped from in _PROTEIN_ wildtype background to and in _PROTEIN_ heterozygous or homozygous background respectively . similar results were obtained with the _PROTEIN_ mutant allele . transmission of _PROTEIN_ mutant alleles in the presence of additional _PROTEIN_ mutant alleles transmission of the _PROTEIN_ mutant alleles was determined by sulfadiazine _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ resistance of the progeny after selfing or crossing of various parental genotypes . a _PROTEIN_ wildtype allele _PROTEIN_ mutant

homozygous _PROTEIN_ seeds are usually non viable in the presence of wildtype or heterozygous seeds in the same silique . indicates significant difference from the expected value . we never obtained homozygous _PROTEIN_ plants that were additionally homozygous or heterozygous for the _PROTEIN_ mutation . on the contrary homozygous _PROTEIN_ mutants that were additionally heterozygous for either of the _PROTEIN_ alleles were frequently obtained and showed normal growth and development . attempts of in vitro rescue of retarded embryos from plants homozygous for the _PROTEIN_ allele and heterozygous for the _PROTEIN_ allele never produced double homozygous plants . to determine whether the transmission of _PROTEIN_ mutant alleles was specifically impeded in the male or the female germline we performed reciprocal crossings between plants with multiple mutant alleles . transmission of the _PROTEIN_ alleles through the female germline was between and when the mother plant was additionally homozygous for the _PROTEIN_ allele independently of the _PROTEIN_ genotype of the pollen donor . in sharp contrast transmission of the _PROTEIN_ allele through the male germline was never observed when the pollen donor plant was homozygous for the _PROTEIN_ mutation . for the _PROTEIN_ allele we observed just seedlings that appeared to have originated from a _PROTEIN_ double mutant pollen . the absolute requirement of a functional _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ allele for male fertility prompted us to analyse knockout mutants for the second enzymatic step of proline biosynthesis as well . in arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ is encoded by a single copy gene and the two t dna insertion lines used in our experiments _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ are listed in the seedgenes database as embryo lethal _PROTEIN_ . although a seed stock from the nasc stock centre was reportedly derived from a homozygous _PROTEIN_ plant only heterozygous or wildtype plants were obtained from these seeds indicating that the parent plant was not a homozygous _PROTEIN_ mutant . the _PROTEIN_ mutant line originally contained at least one additional t dna insertion that was eliminated by repeated crossing to the col wildtype . we determined the exact t dna insertion sites in both lines and confirmed that the embryo lethal phenotype co segregated with the insertion in the _PROTEIN_ gene . siliques of plants that were heterozygous for either the _PROTEIN_ or the _PROTEIN_ allele contained seeds in which embryo development was arrested at _PROTEIN_ after the second division of the embryo proper . the progeny of selfed heterozygous _PROTEIN_ mutant plants segregated for kanamycin resistance as expected forpost zygotic lethality of homozygous embryos without defects in gametophytic fertility . in reciprocal crossings of heterozygous _PROTEIN_ mutants with the wildtype we observed between and resistant progeny but we could not discriminate whether the deviations from the expected value were due to either poor _PROTEIN_ of the resistance gene or mild defects in gamete development or fertility . embryo abortion in _PROTEIN_ mutants . a graphic representation of the exon intron structure of the _PROTEIN_

progeny after selfing or crossing of various parental genotypes . d _PROTEIN_ wildtype allele _PROTEIN_ mutant allele _PROTEIN_ mutant allele . sd was calculated from five batches of seeds from individual parent plants . indicates significant difference from the expected value . attempts to rescue putative homozygous _PROTEIN_ mutant embryos by proline feeding in vitro failed . also efforts to promote embryo development of homozygous seeds in siliques of heterozygous parents in situ by external proline feeding or induction of internal proline accumulation through salt stress were ineffective . we concluded that despite normal fertility of _PROTEIN_ mutant gametes _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is essential for embryo development . to determine the reason why _PROTEIN_ mutations were transmitted through the male germline while _PROTEIN_ double mutations were not pollen grains collected from open flowers of and _PROTEIN_ mutant plants were stained with alexander stain . in this procedure healthy and fertile pollen grains are stained in deep purple while infertile pollen shows weaker or no staining . we detected slightly less than infertile pollen grains in wildtype and heterozygous _PROTEIN_ plants and this amount approximately doubled in homozygous _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ single mutants . plants heterozygous for mutations in both _METHOD_ produced pollen grains that were smaller in size and almost not stained by alexander stain . the number of non stained pollen increased to in plants homozygous for the _PROTEIN_ mutation and heterozygous for the _PROTEIN_ allele . similar results were obtained with _PROTEIN_ mutant plants . on the contrary pollen from heterozygous _PROTEIN_ mutant plants did not show any increase in malformed or unstained pollen which is in agreement with the previously described normal fertility of _PROTEIN_ mutant pollen . defective pollen development in but not _PROTEIN_ mutants . pollen was collected from open flowers of individual plants and analysed for viability by alexander staining . the numbers in the columns indicate the total number of pollen grains analysed per genotype . a pollen of a _PROTEIN_ single mutant plant b pollen of a _PROTEIN_ mutant plant additionally heterozygous for the _PROTEIN_ mutation red arrows indicate non viable pollen grains . c abundance of non viable pollen in various mutant genotypes . capital letters indicate wildtype alleles lower case letters indicate mutant alleles _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . d normal and non viable pollen grains from a heterozygous _PROTEIN_ plant at higher magnification . e frequencies of non viable pollen grains in heterozygous _PROTEIN_ mutants . pollen fertility in the absence of _PROTEIN_ gene _PROTEIN_ suggested an alternative way to ensure proline supply or production in _PROTEIN_ mutant pollen . analysis of publicly available microarray data indicated that only minor amounts of _PROTEIN_ mrna are accumulated in pollen . de novo _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ protein from an intact gene copy might be dispensable if the _PROTEIN_ protein present in the pollen mother cell before the separation of the haploid microspores was still active during pollen maturation . to test the likelihood of this hypothesis the stability of arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ was assessed in partially purified preparations from suspension cultured cells or after heterologous _PROTEIN_ in e. coli . as a matter of _PROTEIN_ the enzyme was found highly stable upon storage at with an estimated half life of approximately days . in contrast the endogenous _PROTEIN_ protein from e. coli isolated and tested under the same experimental conditions lost more than activity within h. the time from microspore separation to anther opening in arabidopsis is around days thus the stability of _PROTEIN_ in vivo could be sufficient to enable the completion of pollen development after meiotic cytokinesis _PROTEIN_ . stability of arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ was partially purified by anion exchange chromatography from crude extracts of an arabidopsis cell suspension culture or e. coli strain and sterilised by filtration . the activity was assayed at increasing time during the subsequent storage at under dim light . results _PROTEIN_ as percentage of activity at time are mean sd over three independent replicates . the lines represent the exponential function that was generated by least square fitting and was used for calculation of the half life time of the enzymes . surprisingly crossing of _PROTEIN_ mutants with plants overexpressing a _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein under control of the cauliflower mosaic virus promoter did not allow the generation of plants that were homozygous for the _PROTEIN_ inactivating insertion . this failure may be attributable to the poor activity of the camv promoter in embryonic tissue . indeed transformation of heterozygous _PROTEIN_ mutants with a construct containing the native _PROTEIN_ promoter and gene fused to a _METHOD_ coding sequence allowed the isolation of plants that were homozygous for the t dna insertion inactivating the endogenous _PROTEIN_ gene . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ under control of the native promoter was strongest in young rapidly growing tissues like young leaves or root tips and was also detected in embryos . subcellular distribution of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was the same in overexpressing plants and in plants with the native promoter construct although in the latter case the _METHOD_ signal was hardly discernible from _METHOD_ signals in mature tissues . analysis of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ in isolated protoplasts and in mesophyll cells revealed a uniform cytoplasmatic distribution of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_
