executer proteins have emerged as participants in singlet oxygen mediated retrograde signalling in plants . this study relates the function of executer in chloroplasts with the acclimation response to increased light .
the aim of the present study was to examine the collective response of the soluble chloroplast proteome of week old arabidopsis plants following a transition from normal light to moderate high light _PROTEIN_ in the time scale of hours . furthermore using arabidopsis mutant plants the link between the executer pathway and the acclimation response upon exposure of plants to high light was investigated . the role of executer in chloroplast light response was analysed using two independent t dna insertion lines inactivating _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ respectively . absence of executer transcripts was confirmed in the t dna insertion lines indicating them to represent true knockout lines . as previously reported and plants showed no obvious alterations of growth and development . because executer proteins have been associated with psii psii performance was assessed by measurement of chlorophyll a _METHOD_ at room temperature in intact leaves from wt and executer mutant plants treated at the two different pfd _PROTEIN_ for . no differences could be detected between wt and mutant plants as deduced from the ratio of variable to maximum _METHOD_ the quantum yield of psii the degree of non photochemical quenching and the excitation pressure of psii . _PROTEIN_ treatment resulted in a decline of f v/f m for both wt and mutant plants . psii performance of intact leaves from nl or _PROTEIN_ treated wt and executer mutant plants was determined by chlorophyll a _METHOD_ measurements using a _PROTEIN_ fluorometer . the maximum quantum yield of ps ii the effective quantum yield of psii the degree of non photochemical quenching and the excitation pressure of psii was deduced . data represents mean standard _LOCATION_ . no significant differences were found between plants in the same light condition _PROTEIN_ . to examine whether chloroplasts are affected by the loss of executer the effect of light was investigated on the soluble chloroplast proteome of arabidopsis . first plants were grown at m s . after plants were exposed to high light intensity during and chloroplasts were isolated from rosette leaves . the soluble protein extract from chloroplasts was analysed by dige following a strategy as depicted in . the dige analysis revealed significant differences between wt and mutant plants both under normal light and in response to high light . the differences in the stroma proteome between wt and are supported by pca . based on the first principal component _PROTEIN_ represents the direction of highest variability after gel data dimensionality is a large variation between wt in normal conditions versus high light treatment . differences between executer mutants and wt under normal conditions are also evident .fig . principal

_PROTEIN_ indicates the direction of the highest variability followed by with diminishing variability orthogonal to _PROTEIN_ for and of the study variance respectively . pca suggested a modification of the soluble chloroplast proteome in arabidopsis upon light treatment . the genotype caused a large shift in the _PROTEIN_ dimension to more positive values and significantly reduced the differences between nl and _PROTEIN_ samples in . a principal component analysis biplot for the complete data set demonstrated a distinct clustering of wt from the executer mutants in the two light treatments

treatments with the largest changes detected in plants . in nl conditions changes in and protein spots were detected in the versus wtnl and versus wtnl comparative groups respectively . when the responsive spots of the two mutant plants in nl versus wtnl were compared spots were exclusively detected in plants as shown in a venn diagram analysis in . upon exposure of wt arabidopsis plants to high light protein spots displayed significant _PROTEIN_ changes in response to the treatment . actually light responsive spots which represent more than were detected in the vs. wtnl and/or vs. wtnl groups . when plants were exposed to high light for protein spots were found to be differentially _PROTEIN_ relative to . interestingly the behaviour of spots was shared between and groups . few differences were detected between versus wtnl and versus wtnl groups with more than common protein spots . in general it was observed that a higher number of unique spots were significantly altered in plants compared to wt and the changes were already significant in normal light conditions .fig . diagram analyses showing common and differential distribution of protein spots detected by dige in
