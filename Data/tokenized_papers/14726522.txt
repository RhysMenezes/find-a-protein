plants produce the common isoprenoid precursors isopentenyl diphosphate and dimethylallyl diphosphate through the methylerythritol phosphate pathway in _LOCATION_ and the mevalonate pathway in the _LOCATION_ . to assess which pathways contribute dmapp for cytokinin biosynthesis metabolites from each isoprenoid pathway were selectively labeled with in arabidopsis seedlings . efficient labeling was achieved by blocking the endogenous pathway genetically or chemically during the feed of a labeled precursor specific to the mep or mva pathways . liquid chromatography _METHOD_ _METHOD_ analysis demonstrated that the prenyl group of trans zeatin and isopentenyladenine is _PROTEIN_ produced through the mep pathway . in comparison a large fraction of the prenyl group of cis zeatin derivatives was provided by the mva pathway . when _PROTEIN_ as fusion proteins with green _METHOD_ protein in arabidopsis cells four adenosine phosphate isopentenyltransferases _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were found in _LOCATION_ in agreement with the idea that the mep pathway primarily provides dmapp to tz and isopentenyladenine . on the other hand _PROTEIN_ a trna isopentenyltransferase was detected in the _LOCATION_ . because the prenylated adenine moiety of trna is usually of the cz type the formation of cz in arabidopsis seedlings might involve the transfer of dmapp from the mva pathway to trna . distinct origins of large proportions of dmapp for tz and cz biosynthesis suggest that plants are able to separately modulate the level of these cytokinin species .
_PROTEIN_ levels in arabidopsis study the metabolic origins of the prenyl group of _PROTEIN_ we planned to conduct the labeling experiment that was employed previously to determine the contribution of the mep and mva pathways to gibberellin biosynthesis . to examine whether this method was feasible for _PROTEIN_ we first analyzed endogenous _PROTEIN_ levels by lc _METHOD_ in arabidopsis seedlings under the same growth conditions after a feeding of non labeled dx and mvl . when dx was fed to the _PROTEIN_ mutant to rescue its albino phenotype all _PROTEIN_ analyzed were detectable by lc _METHOD_ as shown in table i the trend in the amount of individual _PROTEIN_ is as follows nucleotide _PROTEIN_ > nucleoside _PROTEIN_ > free base _PROTEIN_ > tzr > tz . it was also noted that cz type _PROTEIN_ accumulated at much lower levels relative to tz and ip type _PROTEIN_ . similar accumulation patterns of different _PROTEIN_ species were observed when the growth inhibition by mevastatin was rescued by mvl . these data allowed us to confirm that for all _PROTEIN_ examined an accurate quantification of the molecular ion and its isotopomer ion by lc _METHOD_ would be possible in this system with the exception of cz which was detectable but its isotopomer ion was below the range of reliable quantification . incorporation of dx and mvl into _PROTEIN_ evaluate the role of the mep pathway in providing dmapp to _PROTEIN_ dx was fed to seedlings of the _PROTEIN_ mutant . likewise to label metabolites from the mva pathway mvl was fed to wild type seedlings in the presence of mevastatin . in both _METHOD_ one atom would be incorporated into _PROTEIN_ if they were produced through the mep or mva pathways . table ii shows the levels of incorporation into _PROTEIN_ determined by lc _METHOD_ . the incorporation of dx was evident for all _PROTEIN_ listed in the table . for example tzr has a molecular ion at m/z whereas the corresponding ion for tzr from the dx treated _PROTEIN_ seedlings was observed at m/z . a fragment ion of tzr was detected from the dx treated _PROTEIN_ seedlings at m/z which is _METHOD_ unit larger than that of authentic tzr . the presence of a atom in cis zeatin riboside monophosphate and czr was clear in the mevastatin treated plants fed with mvl . incorporation of mvl into cz was also indicated by an ion at m/z which appeared more abundant than of authentic cz at m/z but their relative intensities could not be quantified because of low levels of cz in the samples . fig . shows relative levels of incorporation from dx and mvl into _PROTEIN_ aba and cam determined from the data sets given in table ii after the subtraction of natural abundance . it has been reported previously that the mep pathway _PROTEIN_ supplies precursors to the biosynthesis of aba which is produced through carotenoids in _LOCATION_ . by contrast cam is a _LOCATION_ phytosterol that is primarily synthesized via the mva pathway . our data show that _PROTEIN_ can be classified into two groups based on the labeling ratio from dx and mvl . tz and ip type _PROTEIN_ was labeled at a high rate by dx but only at a low rate by mvl . in marked contrast about of the prenyl moiety of cz type _PROTEIN_ were labeled with mvl whereas the incorporation of dx into cz derivatives was significantly lower than the incorporation into tz and ip derivatives . as discussed previously the levels of incorporation determined across separate feeding _METHOD_ must be carefully interpreted because the ratio of labels in products can be altered by the concentration of precursors in the media . thus the values in fig . do not immediately reflect the relative contribution of each isoprenoid pathway under normal growth conditions . nevertheless we conclude from the lc _METHOD_ data that tz and ip type _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis seedlings are predominantly synthesized via the mep pathway because of the following observations . first the incorporation of mvl into tz and ip derivatives was consistently low whereas nearly of the isoprene units of cam were labeled with in the same sample . this observation indicates that the mva pathway is not the primary route used to provide dmapp to tz and ip type _PROTEIN_ . second the level of incorporation into tz and ip derivatives from dx was as high as that into aba which is known to be biosynthesized _PROTEIN_ through the mep pathway . on the other hand we predict that the mva pathway provides a greater proportion of dmapp to the biosynthesis of cz type _PROTEIN_ in comparison to that of tz and ip type _PROTEIN_ because mvl was introduced into these _PROTEIN_ nearly as efficiently as it was into cam in the same feeding experiment . this idea is also supported by the significantly lower levels of incorporation into cz type _PROTEIN_ from dx than that into aba . subcellular localization of the prenyl group of tz and ip type _PROTEIN_ is predominantly synthesized through the mep pathway we speculated that some ipts should use the dmapp produced in _LOCATION_ . compared with the bacterial enzyme tmr all atipts except for _PROTEIN_ have an amino terminal extension consisting of amino acids . the chlorop program predicted that the amino terminal regions of _PROTEIN_ and might function to localize these atipts to _LOCATION_ . to obtain experimental evidence for the subcellular locations of ipt activities we prepared dna constructs designed to produce translational fusions of individual atipts and _METHOD_ . because some of the fusion proteins containing the full coding regions of atipts tended to precipitate in cells the amino terminal regions which could function as transit peptides were fused to _METHOD_ . the plasmid dnas were introduced into both arabidopsis leaf and root cells and the transient _PROTEIN_ of the chimeric genes was observed . the _METHOD_ of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in mesophyll cells was observed in _LOCATION_ as the signal overlapped with _METHOD_ derived from chlorophylls . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ exhibited the same _METHOD_ pattern as _PROTEIN_ and in root cells . however the _METHOD_ of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was distributed in the _LOCATION_ . it should be noted that an identical pattern of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was observed when the _METHOD_ was fused to the _PROTEIN_ terminus of _PROTEIN_ . the _METHOD_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was observed in the mitochondria . to avoid mislocation of the fusion proteins because of transient _PROTEIN_ by a strong promoter we next generated stable transformants of arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ controlled by their native promoters . consequently the pattern of _METHOD_ produced by both of these constructs was essentially the same as the respective transiently _PROTEIN_ fusion proteins . these results strongly suggest that four adenosine phosphate ipts _PROTEIN_ and localize in _LOCATION_ in agreement with the idea that the mep pathway primarily provides dmapp for tz and ip synthesis . as for trna ipt _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ localized in the _LOCATION_ . we did not examine the location of _PROTEIN_ and because _PROTEIN_ does not appear to encode a functional ipt in some arabidopsis ecotypes owing to a point mutation and because the enzyme activity of _PROTEIN_ could not be detected .
