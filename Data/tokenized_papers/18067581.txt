signal peptide peptidase _PROTEIN_ is an aspartic proteinase that hydrolyses its substrate within the plane of the cellular _LOCATION_ . in vertebrates it plays crucial roles in life processes such as differentiation embryogenesis cell signaling and immunological response . we first found _PROTEIN_ in plants . an ortholog of human _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and its five _PROTEIN_ homologs _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were searched for in the arabidopsis database . these clones were grouped into three different clusters _PROTEIN_ was grouped with human _PROTEIN_ orthologs _PROTEIN_ with the family and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ with the group of _PROTEIN_ proteins of plant origin . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were examined for their _PROTEIN_ profiles by in situ hybridization . _PROTEIN_ was strongly _PROTEIN_ in both the shoot meristem of germinating seeds and the inflorescence meristem at the reproductive stage . on the other hand _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were _PROTEIN_ in the shoot meristem of germinating seeds but at very low levels in the shoot apex at the reproductive stage . the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ was investigated using green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ fusion proteins in cultured deep cells . _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ localized to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ to the endosomes . these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ mediates the cleavage of signal peptide in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ as well as hsspp does and also that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ located in the endosomes have distinct roles in cells .
we screened an arabidopsis genome database using hsspp as a query sequence . we obtained one ortholog of hsspp _PROTEIN_ and five homologs of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . topological analysis revealed that all protein sequences possessed several transmembrane domains with high hydrophobicity indexes . the two active sites yd and gxgd were conserved in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ as well as the _PROTEIN_ motif occurring in the of ap . as predicted _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ encoded proteins of and amino acid residues respectively comparable in size to hsspp . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ encoded proteins of amino acid residues which contained approximately additional amino acid residues in their regions as compared to _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . we constructed a phylogenetic tree of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ using the conserved amino acid sequences in deduced transmembrane domains . _PROTEIN_ clustered with human mouse and zebrafish _PROTEIN_ having identity to hsspp . thus it was given the designation _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ and grouped together with mouse and zebrafish _PROTEIN_ and the putative protein encoded by a clone from the rice cultivars nipponbare . a third cluster was composed of and _PROTEIN_ homologs from mouse zebrafish and c. elegans . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ together with rice _PROTEIN_ genes comprised a cluster independent of nonplant homologs . _PROTEIN_ shared sequence identity with genes in this cluster whereas the clones in this cluster shared sequence identity with each another . these results showed that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ genes in arabidopsis are classified into three groups _PROTEIN_ with hsspp _PROTEIN_ with and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ with a group . to examine the _PROTEIN_ pattern of _PROTEIN_ and its homologs was carried out using the primers shown in experimental procedures . amplified fragments corresponding to _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mrnas were detected in all the tissues roots rosette leaves cauline leaves _METHOD_ clusters siliques and dry seeds . in contrast _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ fragments were undetectable . we next performed in situ hybridization to verify the tissue _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ signals were not detected h after imbibition but appeared h after and remained for up to h . intent signals were detected in the shoot meristem and the epidermis of the radicle particularly in cells near the root tip . the patterns of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were similar to that of _PROTEIN_ in the shoot meristem . at the reproductive stage _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ in the whole shoot apex whereas _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were hardly detected . to investigate the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ we generated _PROTEIN_ constructs in which the _PROTEIN_ of their _METHOD_ fusion proteins was placed under the control of the promoter . analysis of _PROTEIN_ and its homologs using signalp server software revealed the presence of a signal sequence in the regions of the proteins composed of approximately amino acid residues . _METHOD_ was fused to the of the proteins _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . these fusion proteins were transiently _PROTEIN_ in deep cells . _METHOD_ signals corresponding to _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were observed as tubular/reticular shapes which are typical of the plant _LOCATION_ . similar results were obtained with _METHOD_ hdel which consisted of the _LOCATION_ retention signal sequence fused to the of _METHOD_ . _METHOD_ signals corresponding to _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ exhibited a punctate pattern . to determine whether these proteins localized to endosomes we labeled transfected cells with an endocytic tracer that labels endosomes . as shown in fig . h _METHOD_ signals of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were observed on a subpopulation of dotty organelles stained by which strongly suggests that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ localize to endosomes in deep cells . the cells _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ alone exhibited _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ and cells _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ a _METHOD_ fusion protein of the _LOCATION_ sorting signal of pumpkin albumin exhibited _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ . these results indicate that _PROTEIN_ localizes to the _LOCATION_ and both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ localize to the endosomes . in germinating seeds and flowers the _PROTEIN_ sites of _PROTEIN_ were the same as those of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ but the localization was not identified . to examine the localization of endogenous _PROTEIN_ crude _LOCATION_ fractions were prepared from deep cells and subjected to equilibrium sucrose density gradient centrifugation in the presence or absence of . fractions were subjected to _PROTEIN_ and proteins were transferred to a poly _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . _LOCATION_ were then incubated with an antibody against the region of _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ was present in fractions which almost corresponded to the elution profile of the luminal binding protein . in the presence of edta _LOCATION_ ribosomes are separated from the rough _LOCATION_ . under these conditions _PROTEIN_ shifted to fractions along with bip . the localization of _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ intrinsic protein _PROTEIN_ and _LOCATION_ proton pyrophosphatase as controls was almost similar in the presence or absence of . these results support the idea that _PROTEIN_ localize in the _LOCATION_ or the _LOCATION_ apparatus . the transient _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ showed the _LOCATION_ localization of _PROTEIN_ . together with these results we concluded that _PROTEIN_ localizes in the _LOCATION_ . we then examined fraction and fraction by western blotting using an antibody raised against _PROTEIN_ . immunoblot analysis indicated that _PROTEIN_ was present as a protein of kda which is smaller than the expected molecular _METHOD_ of _PROTEIN_ . however when immunoblot analysis was carried out in the presence of a competing antigenic peptide the kda band disappeared . the shift in molecular _METHOD_ observed for _PROTEIN_ may be due to its anomalous behavior on _PROTEIN_ .
