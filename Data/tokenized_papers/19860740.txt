hos catalyse the oxidative cleavage of haem to bv iron and _PROTEIN_ monoxide . in plants the product of the reaction is bv the precursor of the phy chromophore and is thus essential for proper photomorphogenesis . arabidopsis thaliana contains one major biochemically characterized ho _PROTEIN_ and three additional putative hos _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . all four proteins are encoded in the _LOCATION_ but contain chloroplast translocation sequences at their n termini . the transit peptides of all four proteins are sufficient for chloroplast translocalization as shown by _METHOD_ _METHOD_ reporter gene fusions . overall all four proteins can be divided into two subfamilies _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . here we show that all members of the _PROTEIN_ subfamily _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ are active monomeric hos and can convert haem to bv using spinach fd as an electron donor . addition of a second electron donor such as ascorbate led to a fold increase in the haem conversion rate . furthermore haem turnover is also promoted by light when spinach _LOCATION_ are present . all _PROTEIN_ family members displayed similar kinetic parameters indicating they all have a possible involvement in phy chromophore biosynthesis . _PROTEIN_ did not yield sufficient amounts of soluble protein and therefore required the construction of a synthetic gene _PROTEIN_ to the codon usage of escherichia coli . _PROTEIN_ is unable to bind or degrade haem and therefore it is not a haem oxygenase . however _PROTEIN_ shows strong binding of proto ix a precursor for both haem and chlorophyll biosynthesis . a possible function of _PROTEIN_ in the regulation of tetrapyrrole metabolism is discussed .
the _PROTEIN_ protein contains a functional transit peptide for _LOCATION_ localization and is processed to the mature _LOCATION_ ho . the n termini of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ deduced from cdna sequences also showed features of a transit peptide when assessed using the chlorop program . the conservation of primary sequences in this region was much lower than in the ho region also indicating that the stretches in the n termini are transit peptides . to demonstrate the function of the putative transit peptides experimentally we fused the potential transit peptide regions of all four arabidopsis ho genes to a gene encoding _METHOD_ under the control of the camv promoter . the constructs were introduced to n. benthamiana by agro infection . _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was observed in oval structures in the samples in which _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ constructs were introduced . these signals matched the chloroplast _METHOD_ demonstrating that the fusion protein was efficiently targeted to chloroplasts . a control construct without the putative transit peptide showed _METHOD_ _METHOD_ throughout the cytoplasm that is clearly different from the red _METHOD_ from the chlorophyll in chloroplasts . hence as there are functional transit peptides in the deduced _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ sequences this implies that the proteins encoded by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are present as a processed mature protein in the _LOCATION_ compartment . as haem is also present in mitochondria a mitochondrial marker _PROTEIN_ fused to _METHOD_ was observed . the _METHOD_ signals for _PROTEIN_ are different from those of the ho proteins and therefore there is no indication of a mitochondrial localization for _PROTEIN_ in this analysis . the arabidopsis ho genes _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were _PROTEIN_ without their predicted chloroplast transit peptides either using a tac promoter driven n terminal _PROTEIN_ fusion _PROTEIN_ system _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or the pet vector system _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ which uses a promoter and labels proteins with a c terminal tag . after induction with iptg and _PROTEIN_ overnight at the e. coli cells had a brownish colour _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . this is in contrast with the _PROTEIN_ of bacterial or mammalian hos in e. coli which most often show a green colour due to bv accumulation in the cells . therefore the lack of green colour implies that the plant hos might not be fully active in e. coli . _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ and purified as described previously and yielded a major band migrating at approx . kda on _PROTEIN_ . recombinant _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ contained a c terminal tag and were purified by cobalt affinity chromatography . this purification strategy led to over purity . the final yield of recombinant _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ from litre of bacterial culture was approx . mg each . the proteins were stored on ice and stayed fully active for up to days in mm potassium phosphate buffer ph . unfortunately the _PROTEIN_ and purification of recombinant _PROTEIN_ yielded only low amounts of soluble protein . therefore a synthetic gene _PROTEIN_ to the codon usage of e. coli was generated and cloned into pgex . the yield from this synthetic construct was significantly higher than using the native gene and resulted in approx . mg recombinant _PROTEIN_ from litre of bacterial culture . as the recombinant protein migrated slightly slower than predicted in _PROTEIN_ the integrity of the recombinant protein was verified by tryptic digest followed by maldi _PROTEIN_ tof /tof _METHOD_ analysis . whereas the majority of hos are monomeric enzymes others such as ho from synechocystis sp . pcc or ho from human are dimeric . to probe the oligomerization state of the arabidopsis hos gel permeation chromatography on a _PROTEIN_ column was performed . all four ho proteins eluted at approx . ml as a major symmetric peak . however whereas _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ showed no aggregation after purification _PROTEIN_ also displayed a minor peak at approx . ml which was shown to be aggregated protein by _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ on the other hand displayed two minor peaks at approx . ml and ml which are probable degradation products . under our experimental conditions and in comparison with the elution profile of standard proteins all four investigated recombinant hos are monomeric . arabidopsis possesses four annotated hos with only and mutants showing strong defects in photomorphogenesis raising the question whether the hos differ with _PROTEIN_ to enzyme activity . thus we first attempted to analyse the haem binding properties of the four hos . the formation of the haem ho complex was determined by absorption spectroscopy . interestingly only the three hos belonging to the _PROTEIN_ subfamily displayed a strong soret band at nm indicating enzyme bound haem . this soret band is identical to that reported for hos from other sources . incubation of _PROTEIN_ with haem did not result in a significant absorbance change or in the formation of a distinct soret band . even after extended incubation time no haem binding was observed . the addition of reductant also had no influence on the haem binding behaviour . as _PROTEIN_ is not able to bind haem no haem binding constant and no activity could be determined . for the haem binding hos from the _PROTEIN_ subfamily the kd values were calculated from titration data determined by difference absorption spectroscopy . all three _PROTEIN_ subfamily members have kd values in the micromolar range . whereas _PROTEIN_ displayed the highest affinity of approx . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ had slightly weaker affinities of and respectively . all three hos appeared to be saturated at a ratio of haem/protein of . extinction coefficients of the recombinant hos were determined using the method of berry and trumpower . for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ values of and were determined respectively . as _PROTEIN_ did not bind haem we tested whether it will bind the structurally related haem precursor proto ix . interestingly not only _PROTEIN_ but in _PROTEIN_ all hos were able to bind proto ix . but in contrast with the hos of the _PROTEIN_ subfamily _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ a stable complex with proto ix even during gel permeation chromatography . addition of reductant had no influence on the spectroscopic characteristics of the proto ix _PROTEIN_ complex . to determine the enzymatic turnover haem was added to _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ at a ratio and free haem was removed by hydroxy apatite column chromatography . addition of reduced spinach fd to the haem ho complexes resulted in the immediate formation of the ferrous dioxyhaem complex which was accompanied by a shift in the soret band from nm to nm and by the appearance of bands at nm and nm respectively . within min the ferrous dioxyhaem complex was fully degraded to ferric bv the latter being poorly detectable spectroscopically . therefore all subsequent assays for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ contained the iron chelator desferrioxamine and a broad peak between nm and nm was observed indicating the formation of free bv . release of _PROTEIN_ from the hos was assayed by the addition of myoglobin to the ho assay which gave a characteristic _PROTEIN_ monoxide bound myoglobin spectrum . as hos are regiospecific enzymes the reaction products can be one of the four possible bv isomers . it has been shown previously that the isomer is the product of the _PROTEIN_ reaction which is subsequently converted to the phy chromophore by synthase . however hos with other regiospecificities are known from bacteria and insects . thus the reaction products of the three arabidopsis hos were analysed by hplc . like _PROTEIN_ arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ produced the bv isomer with a retention time of approx . min . the ph optimum for the ho activities was ph for _PROTEIN_ and ph for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . all three proteins are more active in the basic ph region than at acid ph values the ph optimum of _PROTEIN_ is identical to that previously determined . the relative enzyme activity increased between and . an arrhenius plot was used to calculate the individual activation energies for each reaction . whereas the ea for the _PROTEIN_ reaction is known to be an ea of and was calculated for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ respectively . kinetic parameters for purified _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were estimated from eadie hofstee plots without ascorbate to slow the reaction . km values of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were determined and are comparable with those of other hos . for _PROTEIN_ the km value of was published previously . a second reductant is known to increase enzyme activity of cyanobacterial and algal hos as well as _PROTEIN_ . we therefore tested the effect of ascorbate on _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ turnover . for both enzymes turnover of haem is fold higher with ascorbate compared with reactions without ascorbate _PROTEIN_ . for _PROTEIN_ it has been demonstrated previously that the primary electron donor in vivo is fd . given all arabidopsis hos possess a transit peptide sequence and are localized to the chloroplast fd receiving electrons from psi is probably the natural electron donor . addition of isolated _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ to the ho assay significantly increased the cleavage of haem to bv after illumination . in the presence of the electron transport inhibitor dcmu bv formation _PROTEIN_ to a relative activity of about . in this scenario cyclic electron flow does not result in net production of reduced fd and subsequent haem turnover . addition of reduced dcip an artificial electron donor to the dcmu blocked assay resulted in an increased bv formation as reduced dcip is able to reduce psi .
