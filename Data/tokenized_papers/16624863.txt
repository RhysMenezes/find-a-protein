cajal bodies are subnuclear bodies that are widespread in eukaryotes being found in mammals many other vertebrates and in all plant species so far examined . they are mobile structures moving fusing and budding within the _LOCATION_ . here we describe a screen for arabidopsis mutants with altered cbs and describe mutants that have smaller cajal bodies lack them altogether have increased numbers of cbs or have flattened cbs . we have identified the gene affected in the ncb mutants as a distant homolog of the vertebrate gene that encodes _PROTEIN_ and have termed the resulting protein _PROTEIN_ . a t dna insertional mutant in this gene also lacks cajal bodies . overexpression of _PROTEIN_ cdna in ncb restores cajal bodies which recruit as in the wild type but which are however much larger than in the wild type . thus we have shown that _GENE_ is required for cajal body formation in arabidopsis and we hypothesize that the level of its _PROTEIN_ is correlated with cajal body size . the _PROTEIN_ gene is unaffected in pcb and ccb suggesting that other genes can also affect cbs .
in the _METHOD_ line the fusion protein is present within the cbs at a high concentration and also localizes at a lower concentration to the rest of the nucleoplasm but not the nucleolus . overexpression of the _METHOD_ fusion protein was shown to have no detectable effect on the growth or development of the plants .therefore it was deemed a good marker line in which to generate identify and study living plants with mutated cbs . cbs in arabidopsis are spherical and often found in close association with the nucleolus . in the hypocotyl cells the cell type used in the screen the _LOCATION_ are large and usually contain a single cb in diameter . two batches of seed were treated with _METHOD_ and then grown to maturity . the resulting seed was then screened for abnormal cbs by _METHOD_ microscopy of the seedling hypocotyl cells . families were examined from the first series and the second series a total of separate lines . from these six separate cb mutants were identified a frequency of . these included mutants with smaller or no visible cbs multiple cbs and cap shaped cbs . in this article we characterize two distinctive cb phenotypes . the first mutant has no visible cbs in any cell type examined the second has a very similar phenotype but often shows small cbs . these mutants were _PROTEIN_ shown to be allelic to each other and were named no cajal body and no cajal body . both the mutants segregate in ratio indicating that they are caused by recessive loss of function mutations at a single allele . these two mutant lines were back crossed to the parental line three times before further analysis and mapping of the mutations . neither of these lines showed any significant growth defects when compared with the parental line . the four other mutants obtained are shown in figure compared with the parental line . the mutant line shown in figure had smaller cbs and was _PROTEIN_ also shown to be an ncb allele and was named ncb . the mutant in figure also has smaller cbs but has not so far been fully analyzed genetically . the line in figure frequently shows flattened or cap shaped cbs and was named ccb . the mutant in figure has an increased number of cbs . this is made clearer by the projection of the entire _LOCATION_ shown in figure . this mutant was named pcb . the hypocotyl cells used in this screen usually showed one or sometimes two cbs in the parental line . the pcb mutant showed significantly more cbs . the numbers of cbs did not differ significantly from the parental line in any mutants apart from pcb and ncb . . _LOCATION_ from different cell types of ncb and ncb mutants are shown in figure compared with the wild type parental line . in ncb cbs are never seen whereas in ncb small cbs are often visible . in both mutants the nucleoplasmic _METHOD_ _METHOD_ appears greater than in the parental wild type . it is possible that this cb phenotype is due either to the absence or reduction of cbs _METHOD_ or to a failure of cbs to recruit the _METHOD_ as in the wild type . we therefore examined ultrathin sections of wild type and ncb root tissue by transmission electron microscopy . because cbs are preferentially associated with nucleoli we examined _LOCATION_ sectioned in a plane such that the nucleolus was clearly visible . on the basis of only this criterion we randomly selected and photographed wild type _LOCATION_ and ncb _LOCATION_ and scored each image for the presence of one or more cbs . because cbs are small compared with the size of the _LOCATION_ not all wild type _LOCATION_ contained a cb within the plane of the section although _METHOD_ microscopy shows that all root _LOCATION_ contain cbs . in _PROTEIN_ of the wild type cells contained a clearly identifiable cb . of the ncb cells none contained a clearly identifiable cb . if we take as the probability of visualizing a cb in a background that contains cbs that is a probability of of missing cbs when they are present . this means that the probability of missing cbs in ncb sections assuming the null hypothesis is or very small probability . we therefore conclude that ncb lacks ultrastructurally identifiable cbs by the criterion of electron microscopy as well as by _METHOD_ labeling . the absence of cbs in ncb was further confirmed by labeling of fibrillarin which is located in both cbs and the dense fibrillar component of the nucleolus . examples are shown in figure c and d. all labeled _LOCATION_ from the wild type showed clear cbs whereas no cbs could be identified in the ncb mutant . the ncb gene was isolated using a map based cloning strategy . a segregating population was made by crossing a plant homozygous for the ncb mutation and a wild type ecotype ler _LOCATION_ plant . plants from this population were phenotyped by _METHOD_ microscopy and genotyped by pcr using characterized markers . the mutation was initially mapped to the top of chromosome between the sslp markers and _PROTEIN_ using a population of chromosomes . the markers _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ on chromosome also gave a low recombination frequency indicating that this region may contain the _METHOD_ transgene . analysis of a further chromosomes identified a single recombination event between the sslp markers and on chromosome but no recombination between and ncb . on the other side of the mutation recombination events occurred between and ncb . the gene _GENE_ which has some similarity to the human _PROTEIN_ gene is located in the interval between and . we therefore sequenced the genomic region containing _GENE_ from the ncb background . when compared with the wild type sequence a single base change from g to a was found at the splice site at the beginning of exon . initial mapping of ncb also positioned it at the top of chromosome with no recombination at the sslp marker . seedlings from a cross between ncb and ncb showed the ncb phenotype indicating that the two mutations are allelic . we therefore sequenced _GENE_ from ncb and again found a single base change from g to a at the end of exon . finally we sequenced in the other four mutants identified in the screen . one of them which we then named ncb is another allele and contains a single base change from g to a at position . this is predicted to change glutamate to lysine . in line only primer pairs _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ produced a pcr product the other primer pairs used for sequencing the gene in all the other mutants and in the wild type failed to amplify pcr products . this suggests a complex rearrangement or deletion in the gene . sequence analysis showed that _GENE_ was unaffected in ccb and pcb . it is therefore probable that these mutant phenotypes are caused by other loci . because _GENE_ was identified as the gene responsible for ncb ncb and ncb we searched publicly available collections for t dna insertions into this gene . line from the gabi kat collection was annotated as having a t dna insertion into exon of _GENE_ . we obtained this line and verified the insertion site by pcr analysis using primers from each side of the insertion site and from the left border of the t dna sequence . plants from this line were then screened by pcr to identify plants homozygous for the insertion and seed was collected from a homozygous plant for further analysis . we carried out _METHOD_ analysis of cbs in seedlings homozygous for the insertion using antibody which is specific for and which we have previously shown localizes cbs clearly in plants . no cbs are visible in plants homozygous for the t dna insertion as shown by _METHOD_ labeling in figure . we designated this mutation ncb . therefore we have identified four independent mutations in _GENE_ and each confers a defective cb phenotype . this _METHOD_ that _GENE_ is required for cb formation . the single base changes in both ncb and ncb occurred at splice sites in _GENE_ the end of exon for ncb and the end of exon for ncb . we therefore predicted that the mrna in the two mutants would be incorrectly spliced . to test this we purified polya mrna and made cdna from the parental line and from each mutant . these were then analyzed by pcr using a forward primer in exon and reverse primers in exons and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . the results of this analysis are shown in figure . as expected the wild type showed a single band for each primer pair of the expected size for the spliced mrna . however each mutant showed two bands of about the same intensity in each case one of about the wild type size and one significantly larger . we cloned and sequenced each band for each mutant . figure shows in diagrammatic form the transcripts identified . in the case of ncb for the smaller band the intron between exons and has been excised but the splicing has been mis targeted resulting in four additional bases being lost from the end of exon in the spliced mrna . in the larger band this intron has not been removed and remains in the mrna . in the case of ncb the intron between exons and has been mis spliced in the smaller band resulting in the loss of six bases from the end of exon whereas in the larger band this intron remains in the mrna . the predicted consequences of these mis spliced mrnas when translated into protein are shown in diagrammatic form in figure and in detail in supplementary figure . the wild type protein has amino acid residues . for ncb the bases lost in the shorter mrna will introduce a frame shift after residue and a stop codon in this frame will terminate translation after extraneous residues . in the case of the longer intron containing mrna extra residues will be translated from the intron starting at residue . there is no stop codon in the intron in this reading frame and translation will continue back into the correct frame at the start of exon giving a polypeptide of residues with the correct start and finish but with extraneous residues internally inserted after residue . for ncb the shorter mrna missing bases would simply cause residues to be deleted . the longer mrna containing the intron would translate amino acid residues from the intron before encountering a stop codon generating a truncated protein of residues . mrna from the t dna insertional mutant ncb was also analyzed in the same way . the insertion was in exon of _GENE_ and the cdna from the homozygous ncb plants was analyzed by pcr using primer pairs before and after _PROTEIN_ the insertion site . both primer pairs gave clear single pcr products showing that transcription progressed through the t dna insertion . translation would be predicted to progress through to exon of the gene and to terminate at a stop codon in the t dna sequence . thus the n terminal sequence from _GENE_ would be predicted to be _PROTEIN_ but to end prematurely within exon with extraneous residues at the c terminus . given that plants homozygous for loss of function ncb alleles have either smaller or no cbs we predicted that plants overexpressing _GENE_ should have larger cbs . full length cdna for _GENE_ was prepared by pcr from a cdna library cloned into a gateway entry vector and then transferred to a plant binary destination vector designed to _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ n terminal fusions under the promoter . we transformed the ncb line stably with this construct . figure shows different cell types from the resulting line . large _LOCATION_ bodies are visible in all cell types in which both the _GENE_ _METHOD_ and the _METHOD_ are concentrated . this shows that _LOCATION_ bodies analogous to cbs were formed in the ncb line when it _PROTEIN_ the _GENE_ cdna . furthermore these structures are likely to be functional because _METHOD_ is recruited to them . in addition these cbs that form in the ncb _METHOD_ transformed plants are larger than those observed in wild type _LOCATION_ . this indicates that levels of _GENE_ protein may regulate the sizes of cbs that form in _LOCATION_ .
