protein ubiquitination is a reversible process catalyzed by ubiquitin ligases and ubiquitin specific proteases . we report the identification and characterization of _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis thaliana . _PROTEIN_ is a functional ubiquitin specific protease and its enzyme activity is required for salt tolerance . plants lacking _PROTEIN_ were hypersensitive to salt stress and accumulated more sodium and less potassium . _PROTEIN_ positively regulated _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ na /h antiport activity . through yeast two hybrid screening we identified a putative target of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ which has previously been reported to be involved in photorespiration and salt tolerance in arabidopsis . we found that _PROTEIN_ is degraded in a proteasome dependent process and _PROTEIN_ stabilizes _PROTEIN_ by removing the conjugated ubiquitin . ser hydroxymethyltransferase activity is lower in the _PROTEIN_ mutant than in the wild type but higher than in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . during salt stress _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ function in preventing cell death and reducing reactive oxygen species accumulation activities that are correlated with increasing na /h antiport activity . overexpression of _PROTEIN_ in the _PROTEIN_ mutant partially rescues its salt sensitive phenotype . taken together our results suggest that _PROTEIN_ is involved in salt tolerance in arabidopsis by modulating sodium transport activity and repressing cell death at least partially through modulating and activity .
we previously reported a systematic analysis of the ubp gene family in arabidopsis . to further determine the specific function of each at ubp member t dna mutants were analyzed for their growth in response to salt . the _PROTEIN_ mutant exhibited reduced salt tolerance . the t dna insertion in this mutant _PROTEIN_ is located in the sixth exon of _PROTEIN_ and was confirmed by pcr using a _PROTEIN_ specific primer and the t dna left border primer . the absence of full length _PROTEIN_ transcript in the _PROTEIN_ mutant was confirmed by rt pcr analysis . when d old mutant and wild type seedlings were transferred to murashige and skoog _METHOD_ medium with mm nacl primary root growth of _PROTEIN_ was indistinguishable from col however shoot tissues showed a significant reduction in growth . at this concentration of salt fresh weight in the mutant _PROTEIN_ compared with growth in col . when seedlings were grown on mm nacl growth inhibition was more pronounced and root growth was also inhibited . to complement the _PROTEIN_ salt sensitive phenotype a bp genomic dna fragment _PROTEIN_ was cloned into the vector . the resulting construct was transformed into the _PROTEIN_ mutant . transgenic lines treated with salt demonstrated that the transgene rescued the mutant phenotype to wild type salt tolerance . these results demonstrate that the nacl sensitivity of _PROTEIN_ is due to loss of _PROTEIN_ function . the transcription levels of _PROTEIN_ in the transgenic lines were similar to or lower than levels in col . the salt sensitive phenotype of _PROTEIN_ was also observed in soil when plants were treated with mm nacl for weeks . under these conditions shoot growth and chlorophyll content were significantly reduced . among members of the at ubp family _PROTEIN_ shares the highest sequence similarity with _PROTEIN_ . however the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant was not more sensitive to salt than the _PROTEIN_ single mutant suggesting that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ do not function redundantly in response to salt . to determine whether _PROTEIN_ is specifically sensitive to na col and _PROTEIN_ seedlings were treated with mm kcl mm mm licl or mm cscl . the _PROTEIN_ mutant was sensitive to mm and mm licl but did not show significant reductions in growth on medium containing mm kcl or mm cscl suggesting that _PROTEIN_ is specifically sensitive to na but not k or . to determine if _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ is regulated by exposure to salt total rna was extracted from col plants treated for h with mm nacl or aba . the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ was induced by nacl but not aba treatment as determined by real time rt pcr analysis . as a control the _PROTEIN_ transcription _PROTEIN_ was included and its _PROTEIN_ was induced by both nacl and aba treatments . _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ in flowers siliques rosette leaves cauline leaves _METHOD_ and roots . _PROTEIN_ promoter activity was analyzed using bp of the _PROTEIN_ promoter fused to the _PROTEIN_ reporter gene . the resulting constructs were transformed into the col background . for each construct independent transgenic lines were analyzed for gus staining . consistent with the real time rt pcr results gus _PROTEIN_ driven by the _PROTEIN_ promoter was strong in flowers siliques and leaves and weak in roots . ubp subfamily proteins contain a conserved cys box that is essential for their dub activity . to determine if _PROTEIN_ possesses dub enzyme activity _PROTEIN_ was translationally fused to a maltose binding protein tag . a mutated form of _PROTEIN_ in which the conserved catalytic cys at residue was changed to ser was created as a control . the two constructs were coexpressed with polyhistidine tagged ubiquitin _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in escherichia coli . immunoblot analysis with an anti ub antibody showed that _PROTEIN_ cleaved _PROTEIN_ but _PROTEIN_ did not suggesting that _PROTEIN_ is a dub and that cys is essential for its dub activity . to further determine if the dub activity of _PROTEIN_ is required for its function in salt tolerance a mutation was generated in _PROTEIN_ based on the _PROTEIN_ complementation plasmid and the resulting construct was transformed into the _PROTEIN_ mutant . when transgenic lines were treated with salt lines _PROTEIN_ the mutated _PROTEIN_ gene did not rescue the salt sensitive phenotype of the _PROTEIN_ mutant even though the mutated gene was _PROTEIN_ at a similar level to _PROTEIN_ in col . when used as a control wild type _PROTEIN_ was found to rescue the mutant phenotype . to examine if na /k homeostasis is impaired in the _PROTEIN_ mutant during salt stress week old soil grown col and _PROTEIN_ plants were exposed to mm nacl for d and na and k content was measured . na content increased in both plants and was significantly higher in _PROTEIN_ than in col . by contrast k content was significantly lower in _PROTEIN_ than in col under control conditions and _PROTEIN_ in both plants after nacl treatment . these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ inhibits na accumulation and enhances k accumulation . to determine if pm na /h antiport activity is altered in the _PROTEIN_ mutant pm vesicles were isolated from mutant and wild type seedlings treated with mm nacl for d. na /h antiport activity was significantly lower in _PROTEIN_ plants than in col plants at all concentrations of nacl assayed . these data demonstrate that _PROTEIN_ is required for the regulation of pm na /h antiport activity . because the _PROTEIN_ mutant accumulated less k than col even in control conditions we determined if growth of the _PROTEIN_ mutant is altered under low k conditions . five day old _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and a _PROTEIN_ overexpression line along with the _PROTEIN_ mutant and col plants were transferred to low k medium containing or kcl . consistent with previous reports _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were more sensitive and the _PROTEIN_ overexpression line was more tolerant to these conditions than the wild type . under these conditions growth of the _PROTEIN_ mutant was not significantly different than the growth of col . it has been shown that _PROTEIN_ functions _PROTEIN_ in shoot tissue to protect arabidopsis from salt stress by interacting with _PROTEIN_ and activating _PROTEIN_ in the pm . the _PROTEIN_ mutant was less sensitive to nacl than _PROTEIN_ but had a similar pattern of growth defect . to determine if _PROTEIN_ interacts genetically with _PROTEIN_ a _PROTEIN_ t dna insertion line was crossed with the _PROTEIN_ mutant to generate the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant . five day old seedlings of the wild type and single and double mutants grown on _METHOD_ medium were transferred to _METHOD_ medium without or with or mm nacl . in the absence of nacl none of the mutants showed any significant differences in growth compared with the growth of col . in response to or mm nacl shoot growth of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant was more severely reduced than in the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ single mutants . when grown in soil and treated with mm nacl for or weeks similar reductions in growth were observed . consistent with these observations _PROTEIN_ did not interact with either _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ in yeast two hybrid assays . these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ function in parallel to regulate the response of the plant to salt . to identify possible targets of _PROTEIN_ we performed yeast two hybrid assays using _PROTEIN_ as bait . two positive clones were sequenced and found to be identical to the c termini of _GENE_ and _GENE_ which encode the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ ser hydroxymethyltransferases respectively . to narrow down the shm interacting domain in _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ protein was divided into two parts _PROTEIN_ n and _PROTEIN_ c . the structures of the peptides are shown in figure and supplemental figure online . these fragments of _PROTEIN_ were cloned into the vector and the full length _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ coding sequences were cloned into the vector . combinations of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ were cotransformed into yeast strain . both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ interacted with the c terminus but not n terminus of _PROTEIN_ . to determine if this interaction takes place in vivo _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ specific antibodies were generated by immunizing mice with e. coli _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . to evaluate the specificity of the antibodies total protein was extracted from col _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and analyzed using immunoblot assays . strong cross reaction from both antibodies was detected in col no cross reaction was observed in the _PROTEIN_ mutant with the _PROTEIN_ antibody and weak cross reaction was detected in _PROTEIN_ with the _PROTEIN_ antibody . we then fused three flag tags in a tandem repeat to the _PROTEIN_ n or _PROTEIN_ c peptides . the resulting _PROTEIN_ n or _PROTEIN_ c plasmids were transformed into arabidopsis leaf protoplasts . the _PROTEIN_ n or _PROTEIN_ c peptides were immunoprecipitated with anti _PROTEIN_ conjugated agarose and coimmunoprecipitating proteins were probed with anti _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ antibodies . the _PROTEIN_ c protein but not the _PROTEIN_ n protein pulled down both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ suggesting that _PROTEIN_ interacts with _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . together with the results from the yeast two hybrid assays our data indicate that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ interact in vivo . _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in shoot tissue and a mutation in _PROTEIN_ resulted in reduced shoot growth in response to salt . it has been reported that _PROTEIN_ is also _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in shoots and that the _PROTEIN_ mutant is sensitive to salt stress while _PROTEIN_ is strongly _PROTEIN_ in the root . based on the overlapping _PROTEIN_ patterns and mutant phenotypes of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ we focused our studies on the functional interaction between these two proteins . we generated a _PROTEIN_ c terminal green _METHOD_ protein fusion construct _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and both full length _PROTEIN_ n and c terminal _METHOD_ fusion constructs _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus promoter . the resulting constructs were transformed into arabidopsis col . in transgenic plants the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signal partially overlapped with the mito tracker red mitochondrial marker which is consistent with a previous report . more than independent transgenic lines _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were tested for _PROTEIN_ subcellular localization however _METHOD_ signal was not detectable in any lines . we also _PROTEIN_ these two plasmids transiently in arabidopsis protoplasts and onion epidermal cells but no _METHOD_ signal was observed . this lack of _PROTEIN_ may be due to the _PROTEIN_ that the _PROTEIN_ protein is likely too large for the transgene to be _PROTEIN_ in the plant or is degraded by a independent pathway as treatment did not lead to recovery of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signal . to further confirm that _PROTEIN_ is located in the cytoplasm _LOCATION_ and mitochondrial fractions were isolated from col plants and subjected to immunoblot analysis with anti _PROTEIN_ or anti _PROTEIN_ antibodies . both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were detected _PROTEIN_ in the _LOCATION_ but were found at a lower level in the mitochondrial fraction . using the same protein samples actin and cytochrome c were found in the _LOCATION_ and mitochondrial fractions respectively . _PROTEIN_ is a ub specific protease and interacts with _PROTEIN_ in the cytoplasm . to understand the nature of this interaction we determined if _PROTEIN_ levels change in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . protein was extracted from d old seedlings of col _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and analyzed using immunoblot assays . the level of _PROTEIN_ protein was significantly reduced in the _PROTEIN_ mutant while _PROTEIN_ protein levels were similar in col and _PROTEIN_ . in addition _PROTEIN_ but not _PROTEIN_ protein levels were further reduced in the mutant and the wild type after h of nacl treatment . based on these results we used a cell free system to determine if the reduction of in response to salt involves a proteasome dependent degradation process and whether _PROTEIN_ is required for this process . protein was extracted from col and _PROTEIN_ seedlings _PROTEIN_ either the flag ha _PROTEIN_ or flag ha _PROTEIN_ transgenes that had been left untreated or were treated with incubated at for or min and then analyzed using immunoblot assays with anti _PROTEIN_ antibody . _PROTEIN_ degraded rapidly in the samples without treatment this degradation was significantly reduced with treatment . the degradation of _PROTEIN_ was even more dramatic in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . _PROTEIN_ did not degrade in this assay and _PROTEIN_ did not affect _PROTEIN_ stability . these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ undergoes proteasome dependent degradation and that _PROTEIN_ is likely involved in this process . to determine if _PROTEIN_ is ubiquitinated in arabidopsis and if _PROTEIN_ plays a role in this ubiquitination/deubiquitination process flag ha _PROTEIN_ was immunoprecipitated by anti ha antibody conjugated agarose from the transgenic plants used in figure . _PROTEIN_ loading was determined with anti _PROTEIN_ antibody and ub conjugation was detected in the immunoprecipitated products using an anti ub antibody . _PROTEIN_ was polyubiquitinated in arabidopsis and this ub conjugation was higher in the _PROTEIN_ mutant than in col . flag ha _PROTEIN_ or flag ha _PROTEIN_ was transformed into nicotiana benthamiana leaves and transiently _PROTEIN_ flag ha _PROTEIN_ and flag ha _PROTEIN_ were immunoprecipitated with anti ha antibody conjugated agarose . immunoblot analysis with anti _PROTEIN_ or anti ub antibody resulted in a ladder of high molecular weight proteins that were detected for _PROTEIN_ by both antibodies but not by the anti ub antibody for _PROTEIN_ . these results demonstrate that _PROTEIN_ is ubiquitinated in planta and that _PROTEIN_ deubiquitination involves _PROTEIN_ . our studies have shown that _PROTEIN_ is found in both the cytoplasm and mitochondria . because ubiquitination is often involved in regulation of protein subcellular localization we determined if ubiquitination of _PROTEIN_ affects its localization . for these assays mitochondrial fractions were isolated from col and _PROTEIN_ seedlings left untreated or treated with mm nacl for h. consistent with previous results _PROTEIN_ protein levels were reduced in the _PROTEIN_ mutant and this reduction became more significant in the mitochondrial fraction in response to nacl treatment . to determine whether the reduction of _PROTEIN_ in mitochondria is due to degradation or a change in subcellular localization proteins were separated using suc gradient centrifugation . total proteins were extracted from col and _PROTEIN_ plants in mitochondrial isolation buffer and then protein samples with the same amount _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were separated by ultracentrifugation in a linear to suc gradient . seventeen fractions were collected and analyzed using immunoblot analysis with anti _PROTEIN_ vdac _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and cytochrome c antibodies . _PROTEIN_ was observed in fractions to in col and fractions to in the _PROTEIN_ mutant and _PROTEIN_ protein colocalized with a _LOCATION_ marker . two mitochondrial markers _PROTEIN_ and cytochrome c were observed in fractions to in both _PROTEIN_ and col . in these fractions _PROTEIN_ was detected in col but was largely absent in _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ and cytochrome c protein levels were slightly higher in _PROTEIN_ than in col due to the requirement for more total protein for the mutant than for the wild type to equalize the amount of _PROTEIN_ protein in both samples . taken together these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ may be involved in regulating the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ however we can not exclude the possibility that reduced _PROTEIN_ stability in the _LOCATION_ of the _PROTEIN_ mutant causes reduced accumulation of _PROTEIN_ in mitochondria . it has been reported that mutations in _PROTEIN_ result in sensitivity to salt stress and increased accumulation of hydrogen peroxide in leaves in arabidopsis . to determine if the _PROTEIN_ mutant has a similar phenotype we first investigated the content in col and _PROTEIN_ by diaminobenzidine staining . the mutant accumulated higher levels of than col after h of treatment with mm nacl . col and _PROTEIN_ mutant seedlings were also treated with mm nacl for and h and content was measured quantitatively with an amplex red kit . nacl treatment increased content in both the mutant and the wild type with higher levels of in the mutant before and after nacl treatment . when col _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ seeds were germinated on _METHOD_ medium without or with or mm nacl _PROTEIN_ seedlings were smaller and chlorotic even on _METHOD_ medium without salt . growth of the _PROTEIN_ mutant was further reduced when seedlings were treated with mm nacl while the _PROTEIN_ mutant did not display any growth inhibition compared with col when geminated on _METHOD_ medium with mm nacl . when treated with mm nacl growth of the _PROTEIN_ mutant was reduced more than growth of the _PROTEIN_ mutant . these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ is involved in salt tolerance partly through modulating _PROTEIN_ activity and at higher nacl concentrations through regulating pm na /h antiport activity . to understand the mechanism by which _PROTEIN_ modulates salt tolerance we monitored trypan blue staining to analyze cell death in col _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . after treatment with mm nacl for h cell death was dramatically induced in _PROTEIN_ with slightly less induction in _PROTEIN_ and little induction in col and _PROTEIN_ . we found that salt stress induced cell death in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ is associated with cytochrome c release from mitochondria a cell death marker . the cytochrome c release was induced in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ but not in col by treatment with mm nacl for h. however after treatment with mm nacl for h a release of cytochrome c was also detected in col . treatment with mm nacl only induced cytochrome c release from _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ after h of treatment . these results indicate that the cell death induced by salt stress in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ is associated with cytochrome c release from mitochondria and that _PROTEIN_ regulates salt tolerance at least partially by modulating cell death through _PROTEIN_ . to determine if shmt activity is affected in the _PROTEIN_ mutant crude protein extracts were isolated from d old seedlings of col _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and shmt activity was analyzed following the conversion of radioactive _PROTEIN_ from ser to methylene tetrahydrofolate . consistent with a previous report shmt activity _PROTEIN_ dramatically in the _PROTEIN_ mutant compared with col . in the _PROTEIN_ mutant shmt activity was reduced to a level lower than in col but higher than in _PROTEIN_ . shmt activity was reduced in both col and _PROTEIN_ when seedlings were treated with mm nacl for h and the reduction in _PROTEIN_ was more significant than in col . _PROTEIN_ regulates both pm na /h antiport and shmt activities . to determine whether these activity changes in the _PROTEIN_ mutant are due to the defect in _PROTEIN_ we tested if _PROTEIN_ directly regulates na /h antiport activity . pm vesicles were isolated from seedlings of col _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ treated with mm nacl for d and pm na /h antiport activity was analyzed . pm na /h antiport activity in _PROTEIN_ was significantly lower than in col while activity in _PROTEIN_ was similar to that in col . these results indicate that _PROTEIN_ positively modulates pm na /h antiport activity . to further confirm that the downregulation of shmt by the mutation in _PROTEIN_ is important for the _PROTEIN_ salt sensitive phenotype flag ha _PROTEIN_ and flag ha _PROTEIN_ constructs were generated and transformed into the _PROTEIN_ mutant and col . overexpression of _PROTEIN_ but not _PROTEIN_ in the _PROTEIN_ mutant partially rescued its salt sensitive phenotype . however overexpression of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in col did not confer additional salt tolerance . protein levels of _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ in col and _PROTEIN_ transgenic plants was similar as determined by immunoblot analysis with anti _PROTEIN_ or anti _PROTEIN_ antibodies respectively .
