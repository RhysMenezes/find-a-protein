the complex process of phloem sugar transport involves symplasmic and apoplasmic events . we characterized arabidopsis thaliana lines ectopically _PROTEIN_ a phloem specific gene encoding _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ a putative _LOCATION_ protein . _PROTEIN_ overexpressor plants grew more slowly than wild type plants accumulated high levels of _PROTEIN_ in mature leaves and had a higher shoot _METHOD_ contrasting with slower root growth and a lower seed yield . similar effects were observed when _PROTEIN_ was overexpressed in companion cells under the control of a companion cell specific promoter . the soluble sugar content of the phloem sap and sink organs was lower than that in the wild type providing evidence of a sugar export defect . this was confirmed in a phloem export assay with the symplastic tracer _PROTEIN_ diacetate . leaf sugar accumulation was accompanied by higher organic acid amino acid and protein contents whereas analysis of the metabolite profile of phloem sap exudate revealed no change in amino acid or organic acid content indicating a specific effect on sugar export . _PROTEIN_ was found to be located in the phloem plasmodesmata and the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . these findings reveal that _PROTEIN_ accumulation affects either the permeability of plasmodesmata or sugar signaling in companion cells with a specific effect on sugar export .
in arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ is encoded by _GENE_ which is composed of a single exon as confirmed by ests and full length cdnas in the arabidopsis information resource database . _PROTEIN_ is a amino acid protein with a predicted transmembrane domain next to its n terminal region which is predicted to be _LOCATION_ . _PROTEIN_ belongs to a plant specific family for which no structural information is available . we searched for structural similarities to proteins of known structure with the i tasser server . _PROTEIN_ has a predicted structure similar to that of two _PROTEIN_ embryogenesis abundant _PROTEIN_ proteins of subgroup _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ embryogenesis protein and a _PROTEIN_ desiccation related protein the structures of which have been determined by nmr spectroscopy with normalized z scores of and respectively . a similar result was obtained with the phyre server with a high degree of confidence . alignments with these proteins indicated that _PROTEIN_ has four helices and seven strands that could form two antiparallel sheets . in this model the transmembrane domain toward the n terminus of the protein is predicted to fold as a large helix . _PROTEIN_ is not present on the affymetrix oligonucleotide array _PROTEIN_ but is found on catma arrays . a survey of the gene _PROTEIN_ data provided by the catdb database indicated that _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ in all organs . we investigated the pattern of _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in various organs by rt pcr _PROTEIN_ mrna was detected in mature rosette leaves senescent rosette leaves cauline leaves floral _METHOD_ flowers and roots . catma array analysis showed an upregulation in rosette leaves after nitrogen deprivation and a downregulation of the _PROTEIN_ of this gene in starch branching enzyme ii double knockout mutants indicating possible regulation by nitrogen or _PROTEIN_ availability . the transcriptional regulation of _PROTEIN_ by sugars was assessed by quantitative rt pcr which showed strong downregulation in response to suc glc and fru . searches for cis acting regulatory dna elements in the _PROTEIN_ promoter with atcisdb identified motifs associated with stress responses _PROTEIN_ and light responsive elements _PROTEIN_ suggesting additional transcriptional regulation of this gene by biotic stress and light . the tissue specificity of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was investigated with a transcriptional fusion of a kb _PROTEIN_ promoter sequence and the uida reporter gene encoding the _PROTEIN_ reporter protein . two representative arabidopsis transgenic lines _PROTEIN_ the gus construct were analyzed . no gus activity was observed in nongerminating seeds or embryos . three days after germination gus activity was detected in the vasculature of the cotyledons . it progressively extended after d in the vasculature to the base of the hypocotyl the roots and the cotyledons . in mature plants gus activity was present in the vascular system of all organs including mature and senescent leaves flowers and roots the _PROTEIN_ of gus in flowers progressed from the sepals to the _PROTEIN_ and the stamen filaments . the vasculature was also labeled in siliques . in mature leaves and in the floral stem gus activity was strictly limited to the phloem tissue in major and secondary veins and to higher order veins such as freely ending veinlets . it was observed in all phloem cell types including parenchyma cells and ccs . we first investigated the phenotype of _PROTEIN_ mutants . three lines with an insertion in the _PROTEIN_ gene were available _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ the abundance of the _PROTEIN_ transcript was similar to that in the wild type so these mutants were not studied further . in _PROTEIN_ we found a truncated transcript bases long whereas the wild type transcript is bases long . there were no phenotypic differences between this mutant and the wild type . we also produced transgenic lines _PROTEIN_ an artificial microrna targeting an _PROTEIN_ specific sequence . thirty independent lines were obtained several of which had _PROTEIN_ transcript levels up to lower than those of the wild type but none showed any growth or developmental defect . the _PROTEIN_ of the sugar transporter gene _PROTEIN_ and sugar accumulation were also normal in these plants . _PROTEIN_ belongs to a multigene family and the absence of an evident phenotype may reflect functional redundancy with other members of this family . a survey of the cell specific _PROTEIN_ of other members of the nhl family from available translatome data sets revealed that several related genes such as _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were _PROTEIN_ in the ccs of the shoot . as an alternative approach we studied the effect of _PROTEIN_ overexpression under the control of the constitutive cauliflower mosaic virus promoter or more specifically in the ccs with the strong cc specific promoter of the _PROTEIN_ gene hereafter named . several lines displaying higher levels of _PROTEIN_ mrna accumulation were selected for each of these constructs . further phenotyping and molecular characterization were performed on two representative lines for each construct with similar growth and physiological effects on the plant phenotype associated with transgene _PROTEIN_ in these plants . the relative amounts of _PROTEIN_ transcript in the lines _PROTEIN_ nhl and nhl were determined by qrt pcr . this transcript accumulated substantially in nhl lines and to a lesser extent in nhl lines reflecting the restriction of _PROTEIN_ driven by the _PROTEIN_ promoter to phloem ccs . the two types of line presented consistent growth alterations with the nhl _PROTEIN_ lines presenting more severe effects than the nhl lines . one representative line homozygous for nhl and one homozygous for nhl displaying times and times higher than normal levels of transcripts respectively were chosen for subsequent analysis . no differences between nhl nhl and wild type seedlings were observed in vitro . however when grown in the greenhouse or in a growth chamber under long day conditions the nhl lines grew more slowly than the wild type lines and the nhl lines grew the most slowly of all . flowering time was delayed by week for the nhl plants and weeks for the nhl plants . the growth of the flower stem of nhl plants was delayed . senescence was also delayed with the leaves beginning to yellow to weeks _PROTEIN_ than for the wild type . this slowing of flowering and senescence extended the growth period of the rosette resulting in the final number of rosette leaves and rosette fresh weight being significantly higher in nhl and nhl plants than in wild type plants . by contrast root _METHOD_ was lower and the shoot to root fresh weight ratio in nhl and nhl plants was and times higher respectively than that in the wild type . at harvest time the harvest index defined as the ratio of the weights of seeds and total aerial parts was significantly affected . seed yield and seed weight were lower than wild type values . the morphogenesis of the plant was not affected leaf shape stem architecture flower and silique formation were not altered . these effects on plant growth and _METHOD_ were not observed when plants were grown in short day conditions . another alteration observed in the rosette leaves in nhl and nhl plants grown in a greenhouse or a growth chamber was a progressive reddening which started at the six to eight expanded leaves stage . the cotyledons and the juvenile leaves began to redden first probably due to anthocyanin accumulation and the reddening then spread to adult leaves progressing basipetally as the leaves matured . it began at the leaf margin subsequently spreading to the regions between the veins . in the most severe cases the rosette leaves developed spontaneous necrotic lesions . reddening progressed acropetally as the plants aged with the younger leaves that were still expanding remaining unaffected . determinations of anthocyanin content in leaf extracts confirmed that nhl and nhl plants contained significantly more anthocyanin than the wild type . thin sections of the leaves from nhl and nhl plants also confirmed anthocyanin accumulation and showed starch storage . redness and anthocyanin and starch accumulation were more pronounced and appeared more rapidly in the nhl plants than in the nhl plants . sugar content was quantified in the rosette leaves of wild type nhl and nhl plants at bolting . at this stage the first eight rosette leaves which were typically fully expanded had reddened whereas the last leaves to emerge which were still expanding remained green . the effect of _PROTEIN_ levels on sugar accumulation was determined either on leaves to or on the leaves that were still expanding leaves and . the soluble sugar content of the young rosette leaves did not differ significantly between the transgenic lines and the wild type . however the sugar content of the mature fully expanded leaves was significantly higher in the mutants than the wild type there was times as much suc three times as much glc and twice as much fru . these increases in sugar content were associated with a _PROTEIN_ in the suc content of phloem sap exudates with no significant effect on the suc/hexose ratio . the suc content of the roots of _PROTEIN_ overexpressing plants was also lower than that of the wild type but no significant difference between plant lines was observed for the glc and fru contents of the roots . the proportion of _PROTEIN_ in the seeds of the nhl plants was low resulting in a low _PROTEIN_ ratio and an accumulation of nitrogen . this suggests that the lower seed weight may result from a _PROTEIN_ in the export of _PROTEIN_ rather than nitrogen compounds . an excess of _PROTEIN_ metabolites can trigger the negative feedback regulation of leaf photosynthesis . we analyzed the _PROTEIN_ in mature and young leaves of the photosynthetic genes _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ transcript levels were significantly lower than wild type levels in the mature and young leaves of _PROTEIN_ overexpressing plants . an effect in the mature leaves was also observed for _PROTEIN_ transcripts although no significant _PROTEIN_ was recorded in the young leaves . we investigated the chlorophyll content and activity of psii in _PROTEIN_ overexpressing plants . the chlorophyll content of the mature leaves of nhl and nhl plants was slightly higher than that in wild type plants with no change in the chlorophyll _METHOD_ of the psii in the leaves of overexpressing plants but with the expected _METHOD_ accumulation of starch and a high protein content . the metabolic compounds in the mature rosette leaves of nhl nhl and wild type plants were analyzed by gas chromatography _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . we unambiguously identified compounds the abundance of of which differed significantly between the lines . the metabolite profiles of the overexpressing and wild type plants were significantly different and this effect was more pronounced in nhl than in nhl plants . the compounds accumulating in nhl plants included sugars amino acids and organic acids . consistent with the findings presented above suc glc and fru were substantially more abundant in nhl plants and other sugars including maltose galactinol raffinose and melibiose also accumulated in large amounts . mannitol a polyol that is barely detectable in wild type plants accumulated in the nhl plants . the concentrations of several amino acids including gln asn gly ser and his were also significantly higher . the concentration of pro a stress indicator was very high . gamma aminobutyric acid a nonprotein amino acid that serves as a stress signal was also slightly more abundant . most organic acids except for citrate and various nitrogen derivatives including allantoin urea and putrescine accumulated in the leaves of the nhl plants . pipecolate an osmolyte was abundant in both nhl and nhl plants as was tocopherol an antioxidant which was slightly more abundant . five metabolites were less abundant in the mutants than the wild type . given the much lower suc content of the phloem sap exudates of the mutants we performed metabolite profiling on the exudates of mature rosette leaves from nhl and wild type plants . the metabolites in the phloem sap exudate were analyzed by gc _METHOD_ and quantified to estimate their content per milligram of fresh weight of leaves . we quantified metabolites in the exudate . the data set was normalized by least rectangle regression making it possible to carry out pairwise comparisons of the metabolite profiles and to eliminate the effects of differences in exudation efficiency between samples . we confirmed the much lower suc content of the mutant in which raffinose levels were higher than in the wild type . by contrast the mutant displayed no significant _PROTEIN_ in total amino acid content . gln content was significantly higher in the mature leaves but unaffected in phloem exudate . a few amino acids such as glu asp and arg were less abundant in the mutant whereas pro and his were more abundant . the lower suc content of the mutant was therefore not correlated with a _PROTEIN_ in overall amino acid content . total organic acid content was not significantly affected either but the levels of succinate and glycerate were lower in the mutant than in the wild type . we assessed _PROTEIN_ in the young and mature rosette leaves of _PROTEIN_ overexpressing plants . encodes a glc phosphate/phosphate translocator that is reported to be suc responsive . this experiment was performed on the line that was less severely affected nhl to limit the downstream effects that may result from an excessive accumulation of sugars . transcript content was higher in the mature reddened leaves from the rosette and in the stem leaves from the transgenic plants than in those from the wild type no such difference was observed for the young leaves . this is consistent with previous reports that _PROTEIN_ is responsive only to high suc concentrations . we also investigated the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ both defense associated markers induced by high sugar content . as for an accumulation of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ transcripts was observed in the mature leaves of nhl plants but not in the young leaves . we also investigated the transcription of _PROTEIN_ which encodes the _PROTEIN_ influx suc transporter involved in phloem loading in ccs . the level of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in the young leaves of transgenic overexpressing plants was moderately reduced whereas _PROTEIN_ transcript abundance was significantly lower in the mature leaves of _PROTEIN_ overexpressor plants than in the corresponding leaves of control plants by up to reduction . the _PROTEIN_ of two genes involved in nitrogen transport was also monitored _PROTEIN_ which is involved in the transfer of amino acids from xylem to phloem and phloem loading and _PROTEIN_ involved in the source to sink remobilization of nitrate . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ levels were lower whereas _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ levels were higher in _PROTEIN_ overexpressing lines . this effect was more pronounced in mature leaves than in young leaves and was stronger in nhl plants than in nhl plants . the subcellular distribution of _PROTEIN_ was first examined with a pnhl nhl _METHOD_ _METHOD_ construct in a transient _PROTEIN_ assay on epidermal cells from the cotyledons of arabidopsis plants . when observed by confocal laser scanning microscopy _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ showed a punctate pattern at the periphery of the cells . when performed on the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ arabidopsis line which produces a plasmodesmal protein fused to green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ we observed that the nhl _METHOD_ fusion and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ colabeled the same structures in epidermal cells demonstrating that _PROTEIN_ was located in pd . _PROTEIN_ was observed within the pd pore whereas _PROTEIN_ was located outside the pore . similar results were obtained with n and c terminal _METHOD_ translational fusions under the control of the promoter in transient _PROTEIN_ assays on epidermal cells from the leaves of nicotiana benthamiana . we confirmed this localization in transgenic arabidopsis lines _PROTEIN_ the pnhl nhl _METHOD_ construct . _METHOD_ was observed in the phloem cells of the veins including phloem parenchyma cells ccs and _PROTEIN_ . the signal in phloem parenchyma cells and ccs was punctate and peripheral consistent with a plasmodesmal location . in the _PROTEIN_ a stacked _METHOD_ signal was observed at the cell periphery with regular _PROTEIN_ reminiscent of the _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ . labeling was also observed in the ccs in a network surrounding the _LOCATION_ consistent with an _LOCATION_ location . in epidermal cells from arabidopsis lines _PROTEIN_ the nhl _METHOD_ fusion under the control of the constitutive promoter based on use of the nhl _METHOD_ construct intense _METHOD_ was observed . this signal was localized to the _LOCATION_ . after plasmolysis it remained attached to the cell wall consistent with its previous localization to pd . the association of _PROTEIN_ with the pd and the _LOCATION_ in phloem cells was confirmed by immunogold labeling with a polyclonal antibody against _METHOD_ on ultrathin sections of leaves from transgenic pnhl nhl _METHOD_ plants . high resolution observations of the phloem by transmission electron microscopy showed that the antigen was present in the pd between phloem parenchyma cells and ccs and in branched pd between ccs and _PROTEIN_ . gold labeling was also found in the _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ . no background signal was obtained in the absence of the primary anti _METHOD_ antibody confirming the specificity of the antibody . we investigated the transport activity of the phloem in nhl _PROTEIN_ plants with _PROTEIN_ diacetate a phloem mobile symplasmic tracer . this tracer was spotted onto a small area that had been peeled immediately before application to remove the epidermal and palisade layers . from the peeled area the cfda progressively diffused from cell to cell until it reached the minor veins where it rapidly entered for transport to the adjacent _PROTEIN_ veins . the translocation of _METHOD_ in the leaf vein system was monitored with a binocular microscope coupled to a video camera . on wild type leaves _METHOD_ was rapidly transported in the minor veins of the surrounding unpeeled region and the dye was present in the _PROTEIN_ veins after min . in the young leaves of the _PROTEIN_ overexpressing plants which had not yet reddened loading of the veins was still observed although to a much lesser extent than for the wild type as demonstrated by the faintness of vein _METHOD_ . by contrast no translocation of the tracer was observed in the mature leaves of _PROTEIN_ overexpressing plants indicating an arrest of phloem transport .
