we isolated an arabidopsis thaliana mutant _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ that has a defect in the organization of endomembranes . this mutant had deformed endosomes and formed abnormally large aggregates with various organelles . map based cloning revealed that _PROTEIN_ is allelic to gravitropism defective _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ gene encodes a homolog of a dnaj domain containing receptor mediated endocytosis which is considered to play a vital role in the endocytotic pathway from the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ to lysosomes in animal cells . _METHOD_ staining showed that _PROTEIN_ protein localizes on punctate structures which did not merge with any markers for _LOCATION_ trans _LOCATION_ network endosomes or prevacuolar compartments . _PROTEIN_ which does not have a predicted transmembrane domain was peripherally associated with the _LOCATION_ surface of uncharacterized compartments . _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ at the early to middle stages of seed maturation . we found _PROTEIN_ mis sorted seed storage proteins by secreting them from cells indicating that _PROTEIN_ is involved in the transport of the proteins into protein storage _LOCATION_ . _PROTEIN_ had another defect in embryogenesis . half of the developing _PROTEIN_ cotyledons grew into the opposite space of the seeds before the walking stick shaped embryo stage . our findings suggest that _PROTEIN_ is required for proper formation of the endosomes involving protein trafficking to the _LOCATION_ and determination of growth axis of the embryo .
_METHOD_ which is a transgenic arabidopsis plant that _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ targeted _METHOD_ gave no _METHOD_ _LOCATION_ when the plants were grown under light because of the light dependent degradation of green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ at the acidic condition of _LOCATION_ . light grown _METHOD_ however retains _METHOD_ _METHOD_ in the entire endomembranes including _LOCATION_ network structures and dot like structures of _LOCATION_ stacks in various organs as shown in figures and . in this study all _METHOD_ images were taken from light grown plants . to isolate arabidopsis mutants that have abnormal endomembrane structures within the cells we used lines from _METHOD_ seeds that had been mutagenized with ethyl methanesulfonate previously . we selected a mutant line that exhibited abnormal endomembrane structure by examining to d old seedlings with a _METHOD_ microscope . the isolated _PROTEIN_ mutant had _METHOD_ _METHOD_ aggregates in most of the cells of cotyledons and in some cells of hypocotyls trichomes and roots hairs . the same phenotype was observed in another mutant allele _PROTEIN_ that we isolated in this study . to know the three dimensional structure of the aggregates in _PROTEIN_ mutant cells we collected the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ images of a series of optical sections along the z axis in _PROTEIN_ cotyledon cells starting from the upper surface toward the bottom of cells and then reconstituted them as a projection movie . an aggregate attached to the cell surface by facing a part of the inner cell surface bulged toward the inside of the cell and connected to the other aggregate that faced the other side of the cell . these observations imply that a part of the endomembranes dilated and/or clustered in _PROTEIN_ cells . to identify the components of the aggregates we visualized various organelles in d old cotyledons of _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ by transient _PROTEIN_ of marker proteins tagged with monomeric red _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ and staining . most of the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _LOCATION_ was completely merged with _LOCATION_ bodies and _LOCATION_ derived organelles in the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ aggregates causing the _LOCATION_ bodies to become yellow _METHOD_ . some of the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ organelles _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ were engulfed by the aggregates . most of the stained endosomal compartments were detected as yellow _METHOD_ aggregates which were found in the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ aggregates . a higher magnification of _PROTEIN_ cotyledon cells showed that the stained sheet like structures on the cell surface merged completely with _METHOD_ _METHOD_ aggregates but not with _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _LOCATION_ bodies . in _PROTEIN_ cells endosomes swelled and aggregated while the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ were engulfed in the aggregates . electron microscopy showed that epidermal cells of the _METHOD_ roots were entirely occupied by a large central _LOCATION_ surrounded by thin layered _LOCATION_ . by contrast _PROTEIN_ root cells appeared to have abnormal cytoplasmic aggregates that contained the _LOCATION_ many endomembranes and fragmented _LOCATION_ . these results suggest that the aggregates in _PROTEIN_ are composed of various organelles including deformed endosomes in different organs . the _PROTEIN_ gene was located in the middle of chromosome between markers _LOCATION_ and _PROTEIN_ . further mapping with plants that exhibited the _PROTEIN_ phenotype and dna sequencing showed a single base pair mutation from g to a in the _PROTEIN_ gene of _PROTEIN_ which might cause a non sense mutation from tgg to tga . to confirm that the mutation in the _PROTEIN_ gene is responsible for the _PROTEIN_ phenotype we obtained three knockout mutants of the _PROTEIN_ gene from the salk t dna insertion lines . these mutants each of which had t dna inserted into an exon of the _PROTEIN_ gene were named _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . to visualize the endomembranes in these mutants a _LOCATION_ targeted _METHOD_ sp _METHOD_ was transiently _PROTEIN_ in epidermal cells of leaves of each _PROTEIN_ allele by particle bombardment . all _PROTEIN_ alleles had the aggregates of endomembranes in the cells as in the _PROTEIN_ cells . we identified one more _PROTEIN_ allele having the aggregates of endomembranes by further screening of the mutagenized pool of the _METHOD_ line . we named this mutant _PROTEIN_ . these results indicate that the _PROTEIN_ gene is responsible for the _PROTEIN_ phenotype although we did not perform the complementation test with the gene . the _PROTEIN_ gene was reported to be responsible for the gravitropism _PROTEIN_ mutant which is deficient in shoot gravitropism and phototropism . we found that all six alleles of _PROTEIN_ to _PROTEIN_ exhibited a defect of shoot gravitropism as does _PROTEIN_ . overall results indicate that the _PROTEIN_ gene is the _PROTEIN_ gene . the _PROTEIN_ gene encodes a polypeptide sequence of amino acids with a single dnaj domain . to characterize the protein we raised specific antibody against each peptide region that is indicated by _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ respectively in figure . an immunoblot analysis with both anti _PROTEIN_ and anti _PROTEIN_ antibodies showed that _METHOD_ accumulated a kd _PROTEIN_ protein . on the other hand _PROTEIN_ accumulated a slight amount of a kd protein which was recognized by anti _PROTEIN_ antibody but not by anti _PROTEIN_ . this kd protein was a c terminal truncated form of _PROTEIN_ . this result suggests that the c terminal region of _PROTEIN_ is involved in protein stabilization and/or is essential for a function of _PROTEIN_ . alternatively introducing a premature stop codon might cause instability of _PROTEIN_ transcripts . _PROTEIN_ is a homolog of rme a dnaj domain containing protein that is required for endocytosis and organization of endosomes in caenorhabditis elegans drosophila melanogaster and human . these results imply that defects in _LOCATION_ trafficking or endosomal organization cause the abnormal endomembrane structure in the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ mutant . to determine whether _PROTEIN_ is associated with the _LOCATION_ fraction we prepared the microsomal and soluble fractions from arabidopsis seedlings by ultracentrifugation and subjected them to immunoblot analysis . most of _PROTEIN_ protein was detected in the microsomal fraction and a small portion was detected in the soluble fraction . this result suggests that most of _PROTEIN_ protein localizes on the _LOCATION_ and a small amount in _LOCATION_ . to determine how _PROTEIN_ was associated on the _LOCATION_ we extracted _PROTEIN_ from the microsomes under various conditions as shown in figure . a portion of _PROTEIN_ was extracted from the microsomal fraction of wild type seedlings by alkaline ph or nonionic detergent but not by high salt . all of the _PROTEIN_ was extracted with an ionic detergent _PROTEIN_ . this profile was the different from that of an integral _LOCATION_ protein arabidopsis _LOCATION_ sorting receptor . this is consistent with a hydropathy plot analysis predicting that _PROTEIN_ has no transmembrane domain . these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ is a peripheral _LOCATION_ protein rather than an integral _LOCATION_ protein . microsomes from seedlings were further fractionated on a sucrose density gradient . figure shows that the sedimentation pattern of _PROTEIN_ was similar but not identical to those of vsr _LOCATION_ and _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ and was completely different from that of protein disulfide isomerase _LOCATION_ . to determine the intracellular localization of _PROTEIN_ we immunostained protoplasts of arabidopsis cultured cells that _PROTEIN_ a _METHOD_ tagged marker for each organelle . anti _PROTEIN_ antibody stained many punctate structures within the cells while preimmune serum for _PROTEIN_ did not stain any structures . these punctate structures merged with none of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . brefeldin a treatment which inhibits guanine nucleotide exchange _PROTEIN_ of adp ribosylation g protein activity induced the formation of the bfa compartment that includes the _LOCATION_ complex _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and endosomes . the _PROTEIN_ punctate structures did not change their structures by bfa treatment _PROTEIN_ . these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ localizes on the unknown punctate compartments . it has been shown that rme a homolog of _PROTEIN_ plays a vital role in endocytosis in animal cells . this implied that _PROTEIN_ is involved in intracellular trafficking in arabidopsis . for investigating intracellular trafficking maturing seeds are an ideal material because they actively synthesize a large amount of storage proteins on _LOCATION_ as a precursor form and then deliver them to the protein storage _LOCATION_ in which the precursors are converted into the mature form . _LOCATION_ sorting deficiency should cause the accumulation of storage protein precursors in dry seeds . wild type seeds accumulated the mature _METHOD_ of major storage proteins globulin and albumin . on the other hand seeds of _PROTEIN_ alleles accumulated and kd proteins in addition to the mature storage proteins . an immunoblot analysis showed that these additional proteins in _PROTEIN_ seeds were the precursors of storage proteins . _PROTEIN_ seeds abnormally accumulated the precursors as did seeds of _PROTEIN_ that lacks a _LOCATION_ sorting receptor for storage proteins . this result suggests that _PROTEIN_ has a defect in the _LOCATION_ sorting of storage proteins in maturing seeds . the morphologies of _METHOD_ psvs showed that _PROTEIN_ psvs were deformed suggesting that _PROTEIN_ is essential for the proper formation of psvs . electron microscopy revealed that the _LOCATION_ space of _PROTEIN_ was abnormally enlarged and filled with electron dense material compared with _METHOD_ . immunogold analysis of _PROTEIN_ seeds indicated that this electron dense material has high concentrations of the storage proteins globulin and albumin . the storage proteins were distributed in the psvs and the electron dense _LOCATION_ space in the _PROTEIN_ seeds . these observations indicate that the _PROTEIN_ mutant mis sorts the storage proteins by secreting them from cells resulting in a swelled and electron dense _LOCATION_ space in the seeds . these results indicate that _PROTEIN_ is involved in the trafficking of both globulin and albumin to psvs in the cells of maturing seeds . figure shows the developmental change in the level of _PROTEIN_ during embryogenesis and seed maturation . arabidopsis siliques were harvested at sequential stages from young flowers to mature yellow siliques and then were subjected to immunoblots . the amount of _PROTEIN_ reached a maximum before the accumulation of vsr globulin and _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ which is required for _LOCATION_ trafficking from the pvc accumulated in association with the accumulation of _PROTEIN_ . the stages of developing embryos for lanes to were estimated to be between the torpedo shaped and the full sized embryo stages considering the accumulation profile of which is known to reach a maximum at the heart shaped embryo stage . this result suggests that _PROTEIN_ functions in intracellular trafficking at torpedo shaped to full sized embryo stages . we found that _PROTEIN_ showed an embryo defective phenotype . the _PROTEIN_ embryo grew normally from the heart shaped to the torpedo shaped embryo stages as did wild type embryo . afterward however approximately half of the _PROTEIN_ embryos started to bend retrorsely before the walking stick shaped embryo stage and the developing cotyledons grew into the opposite space within the seeds . the other half of the _PROTEIN_ embryo grew normally as did the wild type embryo . consequently almost half of _PROTEIN_ seeds acquired an aberrant shape . the defect of growth axis of embryo was observed in other _PROTEIN_ alleles _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . the deformed seeds normally germinated and grew as did wild type seeds . this result suggests that _PROTEIN_ is required for endomembrane organization that supports determination of the growth axis of the embryo between the _PROTEIN_ torpedo shaped embryo stage and the walking stick shaped embryo stage .
