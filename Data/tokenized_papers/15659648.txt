in most higher eukaryotes the predominantly phosphoprotein binding proteins are the products of a multigene family with many _METHOD_ having or more family members . however current models for interactions suggest that there is little specificity among for diverse phosphopeptide clients . therefore the existence of sequence diversity among within a single organism begs questions _PROTEIN_ the in vivo specificities of the interactions between the various and their clients . chief among those questions is do the different _METHOD_ interact with different clients within the same cell ? although the members of the arabidopsis family of proteins typically contain highly conserved regions of sequence they also display distinctive variability with deep evolutionary roots . in the current study a survey of several arabidopsis _METHOD_ fusions revealed that demonstrate distinct and differential patterns of subcellular distribution by using trichomes and stomate guard cells as in vivo experimental cellular contexts . the effects of client interaction on localization were further analyzed by disrupting the partnering with peptide and chemical agents . results indicate that localization is both isoform specific and highly dependent upon interaction with cellular clients .
native gel electrophoresis was used to survey the _PROTEIN_ size and dimerization status of the _METHOD_ fusions within plants transformed with the fusions . native protein extracts from the leaves of transgenic arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ the _METHOD_ fusions were subjected to native pore gradient gel electrophoresis . the green _METHOD_ image of the resulting gel is shown in figure . comparison of the _METHOD_ fusion leaf extracts with flanking molecular weight markers indicates that the all four _METHOD_ fusions produced singlet major bands in the range of kda and a small family of bands in the general range of kda . extracts from plants _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ alone produce a band of kda . these data indicate that the _METHOD_ signal present in the transgenic _METHOD_ fusion plants is a sole and direct result of _METHOD_ that is fused to with little or no cleavage of the _METHOD_ signal away from the fusion protein . in all fusion extracts the _METHOD_ signal is in protein complexes that are in molecular weight multiples that are consistent with homodimers and heterodimers but not with _METHOD_ monomers . the bands near kda in the _METHOD_ fusion lanes are consistent with predicted molecular weights of _METHOD_ homodimers whereas the bands in the to kda range are consistent with the predicted sizes of _METHOD_ fusions heterodimerized with endogenous protein . monomer fusions of to _METHOD_ should be in the range of kda and no bands were observed at this molecular weight in any of the lanes containing extracts from the _METHOD_ fusion . the slight variations in apparent size among the _METHOD_ fusions are consistent the different predicted _METHOD_ of the various _METHOD_ . is the smallest of the _METHOD_ with a predicted molecular weight of kda followed by at at and at kda . these data indicate that the _METHOD_ signal observed in the leaves of the _METHOD_ fusion plants is in general derived from _METHOD_ fusion proteins that are present in a state that is consistent with native properly folded proteins in both homodimeric and heterodimeric states . the _PROTEIN_ levels of the transgenic lines are similar when the overall signal of bands on the gel are used as an estimate of the amount of fusion protein produced . in addition western analysis of the extracts with representative _METHOD_ indicates that the _METHOD_ fusions are produced at levels that approximate typical _PROTEIN_ . the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ demonstrated differential subcellular localization in trichomes . trichomes proved to be excellent cell types for examination of subcellular localization of the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ providing clear distinction among _LOCATION_ and other locations within a prominent cellular morphology and without potentially competing chlorophyll _METHOD_ . the _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ fusions demonstrated a predominantly _LOCATION_ localization whereas the _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ fusions were much more widely distributed within both cytoplasmic and _LOCATION_ locations within the trichomes . in both _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ the fusion protein was seen associated with components of the trichome _LOCATION_ as well as the _LOCATION_ . _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ without fusion to showed a generalized subcellular distribution in both _LOCATION_ and cytoplasmic compartments . in addition to the differences in gross subcellular localization demonstrated by _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ versus _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ each isoform also displayed individual differences in localization within the _LOCATION_ . _METHOD_ was fairly concentrated within the nucleolus whereas _METHOD_ was less prominent in the nucleolus than in the surrounding _LOCATION_ material . the _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ fusions were more uniformly distributed within the _LOCATION_ showing no apparent affinity for or exclusion from the nucleolus . differences in the subcytoplasmic localization between _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ were subtle but apparent . _METHOD_ seemed to be consistently more widely _PROTEIN_ throughout the cytoplasm and cell _LOCATION_ than _METHOD_ which demonstrated a more limited and punctate distribution . subcellular localization of _METHOD_ fusions was dependent upon cell type . guard cells demonstrated distinctive subcellular localization among the _METHOD_ fusions but those localizations were not necessarily the same as those observed in trichomes . _METHOD_ was again decidedly _LOCATION_ in localization within guard cells whereas _METHOD_ localization seemed to be absent from the _LOCATION_ and limited to the peripheral guard cell edges in contact with the stomatal pore . the distributions of _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ were similar to each other although distinctly different from the distributions of either _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ . the subcellular distribution of _METHOD_ in trichomes is consistent among trichomes and leaves . figure a and b provides a field view of _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ plants to show the number of trichome cells available for analysis on typical leaves . figure c and d present a closer view of leaves showing the subcellular distribution in eight to trichomes scattered across the leaf surface . figure provides a relative quantification of the distribution of the _METHOD_ signal in _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ . on the average _METHOD_ signal in the _LOCATION_ comprises of the total signal in the trichome body . in _METHOD_ trichomes _LOCATION_ signal comprises of the total signal in the trichome body . in all cases the distribution of the _METHOD_ fusion was the result of dynamic processes and proteins in differential motion within the cells . figure displays a subset of still images from a movie that can be found online as supplemental material . these frames illustrate the dynamic movement of _METHOD_ along the cytoskeletal network in trichomes . aicar is a amp analog that is known to disrupt the biochemical and biological influence of upon their target clients . aicar is useful in an in vivo experimental environment because it can penetrate plant cell walls and _LOCATION_ while retaining its activity as a amp mimetic . aicar treatment of leaves resulted in a dramatic alteration in the subcellular localization of _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ fusions within trichomes . figure displays trichomes from the aicar treatments of leaves . the top panel shows trichomes photographed before treatment with aicar and the bottom panel shows trichomes after h incubation in aicar . where possible the same trichome was photographed before and after treatment . . instead of the characteristic _LOCATION_ localization of _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ aircar treatment resulted in _METHOD_ signal widely and diffusely spread throughout the distal portions of the trichome with no indication of _LOCATION_ localization . aicar treatment of leaves also disrupted the _METHOD_ localization within trichomes resulting in distinctively globular regions of _METHOD_ that were nonnuclear but still mobile within the cell . similar aicar treatment had no apparent effect on nonfusion _METHOD_ . treatment with aicar had little overt effect on the distribution of _METHOD_ however a close inspection of the cells after treatment revealed that the dynamic motion of the fusion proteins characteristic of these cells is greatly diminished in the presence of aicar . the _PROTEIN_ peptide is a very high affinity target having a higher affinity for binding than any known target . thus it can act as an antagonist of client binding and is expected to outcompete any native protein to disrupt the partnering of the with their targets . figure illustrates the effects of incubating excised leaf sections with _PROTEIN_ . the top panel of figure shows trichomes photographed before treatment and the middle panel shows trichomes photographed after h of incubation with _PROTEIN_ . the bottom panel demonstrates the effect on _METHOD_ signal distribution by using an unrelated peptide that does not have an affinity for binding . treatment with _PROTEIN_ peptide had a dramatic effect on the distributions of all _METHOD_ fusions . the _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ distributions changed from their characteristic _LOCATION_ predominance to a generalized and diffuse distribution similar to that seen with aicar . the _METHOD_ fusion similarly lost its native localization becoming distributed in globules similar but not identical to those seen with aicar treatment of _METHOD_ . in contrast to treatment with aicar the _METHOD_ distribution was clearly affected by treatment with _PROTEIN_ peptide losing its characteristic cellular specific localization and becoming very diffusely distributed throughout the trichome . similar experimental treatment of leaves with _PROTEIN_ peptide had no influence on the localization of _METHOD_ alone . in addition similar experimental incubation with a nonrelated peptide had no influence on the distribution of _METHOD_ signal in any of the _METHOD_ fusions or on _METHOD_ itself . figure displays an extended time course of the treatment of _METHOD_ with _PROTEIN_ . these sequential images of the same trichome illustrate the progressive nature of the effect that incubation with _PROTEIN_ has on the distribution of the _METHOD_ fusions in min intervals .
arabidopsis plants were transformed through vacuum infiltration with fusion proteins composed of the coding region of various _METHOD_ coupled to _METHOD_ and driven by the promoter . the _METHOD_ investigated include and . between four and six plant lines of each transformant were screened by visual inspection before selecting a single line for each isoform for subsequent analyses . although there are some differences in the intensity of _PROTEIN_ among lines the patterns of subcellular distribution of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ are consistent among lines . in addition a positive control consisting of _METHOD_ alone was used for comparison . plants were grown horizontally in plates on nutrient agar and were typically weeks old when they were used for analyses . plants were examined with an olympus _METHOD_ microscope coupled to an evolution _PROTEIN_ cooled charge coupled device camera with q capture software . for trichomes photos were taken through the objective and captured with no binning . the specific region of interest was subsequently cropped from the resulting large digital file . images of _LOCATION_ and guard cells were similarly completed using the objective . slide samples were prepared in water or phosphate buffered saline tween _PROTEIN_ depending on the application . for figures and leaves were cut from the living plants just before mounting on the slide in water . for figures the slides were prepared for the in situ incubation of leaf sections on the slide with biochemical reagents or were prepared with excised leaves that had been incubated in a given reagent for h in a separate microfuge tube . digital images of single trichomes were opened in bio rad 's quantity one program and the volume tools software was used to establish relative amounts of _METHOD_ signal within sections of the trichome image . the pixel volume integration of the _LOCATION_ region alone was divided by total pixel volume integration of an area within the body of the trichome to find the proportion of the signal that resides in the _LOCATION_ . because portions of the trichome exit the focal plane this calculation does not represent percentage of _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ in any strict sense but it does represent a comparison of relative _LOCATION_ localization within the body of the trichome . five trichomes from _METHOD_ plants and five from _METHOD_ plants were used in the analysis . the values for each isoform are presented in figure as averages with standard deviations indicated as _LOCATION_ bars . in all cases the plant material was prepared fresh and either treated in situ on a microscope slide or incubated in the given solution in a ml microcentrifuge tube . aminoimidazole _PROTEIN_ ribonucleoside monophosphate . leaves were excised from the plant the midvein was removed with a scalpel and the leaf sections were placed on slides flooded with mm aicar in water . trichomes were photographed at h intervals . peptide competition . leaves were excised from the plant the midvein was removed with a scalpel and the leaf sections were incubated in microfuge tubes containing either the peptide _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or a peptide composed of the _PROTEIN_ terminal region of . both peptides used at a concentration of in _PROTEIN_ t. as with the aicar treatments trichomes were photographed at h intervals . leaves incubated in _PROTEIN_ t alone were indistinguishable with those incubated in water . leaves from wk old transgenic arabidopsis plants _PROTEIN_ the _METHOD_ fusions were extracted in native sample buffer in ice at a ratio of of buffer for every mg of leaf tissue . a motor driven homogenizer was used to grind the tissue into a slurry in a microfuge tube and then the slurry was centrifuged at g at to remove debris . extracts were resolved with nondenaturing acrylamide electrophoresis with the modification that the gel was prepared with a pore gradient . the resultant gel was scanned on a bio rad molecular imager fx at nm and rendered into a digital image with the bio rad fx software .
