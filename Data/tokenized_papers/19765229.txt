we identified and functionally characterized the atskip gene an arabidopsis homologue of snw/skip under abiotic stresses . although the snw/skip protein has been implicated as a critical transcription cofactor its biological functions have yet to be reported in any plant . recently we have isolated genes via the overexpression screening of yeast with a maize cdna library . one of the selected genes appeared to confer elevated tolerance to salt . maize cdna encodes a homologue of the human snw/skip transcriptional coregulator . treatment with salt mannitol and abscisic acid induced atskip _PROTEIN_ . ectopic _PROTEIN_ of the atskip gene modulated the induction of salt tolerance dehydration resistance and insensitivity towards abscisic acid under stress conditions . by contrast atskip antisense lines displayed reduced tolerance to abiotic stresses during germination . moreover a _PROTEIN_ in atskip _PROTEIN_ resulted in an abnormal phenotype . we further determined that the atskip protein activated the transcription of a reporter gene in yeast . green _METHOD_ atskip was localized in the _LOCATION_ of both onion cells and transgenic arabidopsis cells . taken together these results suggest that atskip functions as both a positive regulator and putative potential transcription _PROTEIN_ in the abiotic stress signalling pathway .
previously we have isolated sats via the overexpression screening of yeast with a maize cdna library from kernels . during screening we identified a maize clone that appeared to confer elevated tolerance to salt in comparison with control cells . the isolated partial cdna displayed considerable homology with known members of the snw/skip protein family . snw/skip is a _LOCATION_ protein that is highly conserved in a wide variety of _METHOD_ from yeasts to humans and is ubiquitously essential for survival . several lines of evidence show that _PROTEIN_ is a critical transcription cofactor but its biological functions have yet to be reported in any plant . in an effort to gain an insight into the function of the snw/skip gene in plants we attempted to isolate the gene in arabidopsis that encodes for sequences similar to the isolated partial maize . the isolated cdna sequence comprised bp and harboured one single open reading frame encoding a protein of amino acids with a calculated molecular weight of kda . as shown in fig . the deduced amino acid sequence displayed a considerable degree of homology with already identified members of the snw/skip protein family . the a. thaliana gene was therefore designated as atskip . on the basis of the amino acid sequence alignments at least three distinct domains were detected within the snw/skip homologues a central domain harbouring the snw box a less domain that has so far not been linked to a specific function but which contains a box that was also identified in atskip and a domain involved in homodimer formation and in the interaction with the small subunit of splicing _PROTEIN_ . based on its amino acid sequence features atskip _METHOD_ to be encoded by only one gene in the arabidopsis genome and can be clearly assigned to the snw/skip family of transcriptional regulators . to obtain clues _PROTEIN_ the function of atskip we initially assessed its _PROTEIN_ pattern . northern blot experiments demonstrated that atskip was _PROTEIN_ in every developmental stage and within the entire plant especially the roots inflorescence _METHOD_ rosette leaves and flowers with a small amount of the transcript being detected in the seeds and siliques . _PROTEIN_ analysis in arabidopsis revealed that the _PROTEIN_ of atskip was induced by aba senescence salinity drought osmotic stress and cold . next in an effort to determine the in vivo functions of atskip we assessed the accumulation of atskip rna in arabidopsis seedlings during salt mannitol and aba treatment using qpcr . as shown in fig . atskip was induced slightly in arabidopsis seedlings within h of salt or aba treatment and continued with time . a mannitol concentration of mm resulted in a slight induction of atskip in the whole parts of seedlings within h of mannitol treatment with a marginal decline after h. the induction in atskip _PROTEIN_ was sustained for at least h after mannitol treatment . atskip was also induced steadily during mannitol treatment in contrast with the control responsive to desiccation _PROTEIN_ gene which was induced quickly and transiently . however atskip _PROTEIN_ was induced to a lesser degree on average compared with and samples . to determine the subcellular localization of atskip a green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ reporter gene was fused to the atskip coding region to generate a _METHOD_ fusion protein in onion cells and transgenic arabidopsis plants . as shown in fig . the _METHOD_ signal of the _METHOD_ construct was detected in the _LOCATION_ of the onion cells and in transgenic arabidopsis however the majority of the _METHOD_ protein was located in the cytoplasm of the onion cells and the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ signal was weak . these results are consistent with the identity of atskip as a _LOCATION_ protein which is in agreement with its predicted function as a putative transcription _PROTEIN_ . to determine whether atskip could display transcriptional activation activity cdna of atskip was fused to the domain and the resultant construct was introduced into yeast strain . the protein was capable of inducing lacz _PROTEIN_ by itself in yeast cells indicative of a putative transcriptional activator function for the atskip protein . to further define the regions corresponding to the transcriptional activation domain we constructed mutants with deleted portions of the atskip protein . when part of the was deleted a positive colour reaction developed within h on the filter assay . as was the case with construct constructs and also conferred a high level of lacz _PROTEIN_ within h . when the end was deleted leaving only the region or central peptides with the region no lacz _PROTEIN_ was evident even on overnight incubation implicating the domain as crucial for transcriptional activation activity . as the filter assay does not provide a quantitative measure of the lacz _PROTEIN_ level a second set of experiments was conducted in which activity was assayed in the lysates of yeast cells _PROTEIN_ these deletion constructs of the atskip protein . figure shows the activity recovered from yeast cells _PROTEIN_ the atskip deletion proteins . fundamentally the results of this analysis were consistent with those obtained from the filter assay . furthermore in an effort to evaluate the functional consequences of the loss of atskip atskip antisense lines were generated using cdna sequences . the snw/skip protein _METHOD_ an essential function as a transcriptional activator in all eukaryotes for example knockout of this gene is lethal as has been demonstrated in saccharomyces cerevisiae and schizosaccharomyces pombe . in this study because the _PROTEIN_ of atskip was only partially abolished as shown by the results of we successfully obtained atskip antisense transgenic lines . pleiotropic abnormal developmental phenotypes were observed in these antisense lines including reduced inflorescence _METHOD_ and smaller rosette leaves . in addition antisense lines showed markedly reduced seed production as indicated by the observation of shortened siliques with fewer seeds . these results strongly bolster the concept that the atskip gene may perform a crucial function in the regulation of the plant development of arabidopsis . to assess its function in vivo we induced atskip overexpression in arabidopsis under the control of the promoter . eight homozygous lines were obtained and two lines that displayed high levels of transgene _PROTEIN_ were selected for phenotypic characterization . the comparison of lines with plants demonstrated no morphological alterations or retardation of growth . we attempted to determine whether salt mannitol or aba stress tolerance could be influenced by the levels of atskip _PROTEIN_ . atskip _PROTEIN_ was assessed via in two randomly selected independent atskip antisense lines . atskip _PROTEIN_ was knocked down in the antisense lines . to evaluate the effects of atskip _PROTEIN_ on germination with aba treatment the seeds of wt atskip and plants were germinated on murashige and skoog _METHOD_ medium . the germination ratio among wt atskip and plants was similar and acceptable on _METHOD_ medium . as the seeds of wt atskip and plants germinated on _METHOD_ medium containing aba the cotyledon greening efficiency of wt was only slightly above at d after germination less than of the atskip mutant plants remained alive and only of the atskip cotyledons expanded and turned green compared with in and . these results indicate that the atskip mutant is more likely than the wt to be sensitive to aba . however the plants were demonstrated to be more resistant to exogenous aba than were the wt and atskip mutant plants . to evaluate the effects of atskip _PROTEIN_ on germination with elevated salinity or mannitol the seeds of the wt atskip and plants were germinated in _METHOD_ medium supplemented with mm nacl or mm mannitol and then permitted to grow for d before assessment of the survival rates of the plants in response to salt or dehydration stress . at mm nacl c. of the wt leaves expanded and turned green compared with more than of the and lines . by contrast of two atskip transgenic lines remained alive at d after germination . osmotic stress also resulted in drastic differences in the survival rate after d of two seeds generated pale green or green leaves compared with c. of the wt controls whereas less than of the antisense transgenic plants remained alive at dag . these results are consistent with atskip being a necessary component for the regulation of developmental growth under abiotic stress . it has been relatively well established that the _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ genes is induced by stress . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are also induced under drought aba and salt stress conditions . in addition the _PROTEIN_ gene is induced by aba high salinity cold and osmotic stress . figure shows that the transcript levels of genes including _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ displayed enhanced induction in and wt plants than in mutant plants following aba or mannitol treatment as the _PROTEIN_ of the three genes was slightly less induced by salt treatment in the mutant than in the wt and plants . these observations support the concept that atskip regulates the _PROTEIN_ of these stress marker genes under salt dehydration and aba stress conditions . however the _PROTEIN_ levels of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in wt and plants under aba or salt stress seem to be very similar . this probably indicates that the overexpression of atskip by itself is not sufficient for the induction of genes and may require additional components .
arabidopsis plants were grown in growth chambers under intense light at relative humidity and a h day length . the plants were _PROTEIN_ with salt by the submersion of arabidopsis seedlings in a solution containing mm nacl . samples were obtained at and h of salt stress . for the mannitol treatment of arabidopsis seedlings were submerged in a solution containing mm mannitol and sampled at and h. for aba _PROTEIN_ seedlings were submerged in a solution containing aba and sampled at and h. in each case the retrieved seedlings were promptly frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at . quantitative polymerase chain reaction was carried out with a quantitative pcr apparatus and the results were analysed using software . total rna was extracted from the variously treated arabidopsis seedlings using an rneasy plant mini kit . qpcr was carried out using the sensimix kit . arabidopsis was used as the internal control . quantitative analysis was carried out using the delta delta ct method . each sample was run in three independent experiments . the reaction primers utilized were as follows for qpcr of atskip upstream and downstream for qpcr of _PROTEIN_ upstream and downstream for qpcr of _PROTEIN_ upstream and downstream for qpcr of _PROTEIN_ upstream and downstream for qpcr of upstream and downstream . for the analysis of transactivation activity a subclone of each type of atskip deletion cdna was constructed via pcr amplification using primers harbouring the bamhi and sali restriction endonuclease sites . the coding sequences were inserted into the _PROTEIN_ vector and the clones obtained were confirmed by dna sequence analysis . deletion constructs were transformed into the yeast strain _PROTEIN_ > > cycr by the lithium method and the cells were selected on trp medium . colonies were replated on trp medium and employed for filter assays as described previously . to measure the strength of activity from the atskip deletion constructs a liquid assay using as a substrate was conducted as described by the manufacturer . the cdna fragment of atskip was amplified by pcr using the forward primer and reverse primer . the pcr products were initially cloned into the pgem vector and confirmed by sequencing . this antisense atskip cdna construct was then released by digestion with bamhi and saci and subcloned into the vector under the control of the constitutive promoter . the construct was then transformed into arabidopsis plants and the resultant homozygous transgenic lines were evaluated for aba and abiotic stress sensitivity . total rna was isolated from arabidopsis leaves using trizol reagent . reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction was utilized to obtain atskip cdna . the generated product was then cloned into the pgem vector for dna sequence analysis . the primers were as follows forward primer and reverse primer on the basis of the sequence information in a cdna database . amplification proceeded for cycles consisting of for s for s and for min . the products were with bamhi and saci and then directionally cloned into the plant _PROTEIN_ vector . the resultant construct was introduced into agrobacterium tumefaciens strain by in planta vacuum infiltration . homozygous lines from eight independent transformants were obtained and two lines displaying high levels of transgene _PROTEIN_ were selected for phenotypic characterization . the kanamycin resistance of the generation from these two selected lines segregated as a single locus .
