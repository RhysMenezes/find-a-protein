_PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ synthetase enzymes which catalyse the rate limiting step of proline biosynthesis are encoded by two closely related genes in arabidopsis . transcription of the genes is differentially regulated by drought salinity and abscisic acid suggesting that these genes play specific roles in the control of proline biosynthesis . here we describe the genetic characterization of insertion mutants which indicates that _PROTEIN_ is required for proline accumulation under osmotic stress . knockout mutations of _PROTEIN_ result in the reduction of stress induced proline synthesis hypersensitivity to salt stress and accumulation of reactive oxygen species . by contrast _PROTEIN_ mutations cause embryo abortion during _PROTEIN_ stages of seed development . the desiccation sensitivity of _PROTEIN_ embryos does not reflect differential control of transcription as both mrnas are detectable throughout embryonic development . cellular localization studies with _METHOD_ gene fusions indicate that _PROTEIN_ is sequestered into subcellular bodies in embryonic cells where _PROTEIN_ is dominantly cytoplasmic . although proline feeding rescues the viability of mutant embryos _PROTEIN_ seedlings undergo aberrant development and fail to produce fertile plants even when grown on proline . in seedlings specific _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ is seen in leaf primordia where _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ levels are very low and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ also shows a distinct cell type specific and subcellular localization pattern compared to _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in root tips leaves and flower organs . these data demonstrate that the arabidopsis enzymes perform non redundant functions and that _PROTEIN_ is insufficient for compensation of developmental defects caused by inactivation of _PROTEIN_ .
we have characterized four _PROTEIN_ insertion mutations obtained from the salk collection . the mutant _PROTEIN_ carries a t dna insertion in _PROTEIN_ sequences representing the utr of the mrna bp upstream of the _PROTEIN_ codon . in the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants the t dna insertions are localized and bp downstream of the _PROTEIN_ in introns and respectively . in the line _PROTEIN_ the t dna insertion is localized bp downstream of _PROTEIN_ in exon . transcription of the mutant alleles was characterized by semi quantitative rt pcr using rna templates isolated from week old seedlings grown either without salt or in the presence of mm nacl for h. using a primer pair for amplification of the full length cdna a residual low level of _PROTEIN_ transcription was detected in the salt treated _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants that carried t dna insertions in the leader region and intron respectively . the levels of full length transcripts in the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants were and respectively of the _PROTEIN_ rna level in the salt treated wild type control indicating that these lines represent strong knock down alleles . because all salk t dna insertions carry a camv promoter upstream of the t dna left border that drives transcription through the insert junctions we also examined whether _PROTEIN_ sequences located downstream of the various insertions are transcribed in the mutants . rt pcr amplification of utr region of _PROTEIN_ detected less than transcript in the _PROTEIN_ mutant and an even lower level of truncated _PROTEIN_ rna in the _PROTEIN_ knockout line . by contrast levels of truncated _PROTEIN_ mrnas that were of those of the salt treated wild type control were found in the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants in both the presence and absence of salt induction indicating that the bulk of these truncated rnas are transcribed from the camv promoter . these data suggest that the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutations allow the synthesis of truncated _PROTEIN_ enzymes that lack the n terminal glutamyl kinase domain . because the glutamyl kinase activity is absolutely essential for the first step of proline biosynthesis both the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutations affected proline biosynthesis analogously to the strong knock down allele _PROTEIN_ and the _PROTEIN_ null mutation which inactivated the c terminal glutamic semi aldehyde dehydrogenase domain . under standard growth conditions all _PROTEIN_ mutants showed wild type development in both soil and sterile culture . in rosette leaves of week old soil grown _PROTEIN_ plants the free proline content was lower compared to wild type whereas in flowers this difference was . the observed _PROTEIN_ in proline content of _PROTEIN_ mutants indicated the contribution of _PROTEIN_ to proline synthesis under normal growth conditions in sterile culture and showed that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ a sufficiently high level proline biosynthesis without limiting growth and fertility . to determine the effects of _PROTEIN_ mutations on salt induced proline accumulation in vitro cultured week old wild type and _PROTEIN_ seedlings were exposed to mm nacl treatment for h . compared to untreated controls the free proline levels increased sevenfold in wild type during salt treatment but only two to threefold in the _PROTEIN_ mutants . this striking difference clearly shows that the deficiency of _PROTEIN_ was not fully compensated by _PROTEIN_ and indicates that _PROTEIN_ plays a critical role in the regulation of proline accumulation during salt stress . to examine how changes in proline accumulation correlate with alterations in water relations wild type and _PROTEIN_ plants were exposed to drought treatment by stopping irrigation for days . while soil humidity _PROTEIN_ from to during this period the concentration of free proline in the rosette leaves of wild type plants increased up to eightfold compared to an increase of no more than twofold in the _PROTEIN_ mutants . this indicated that similarly to salt stress _PROTEIN_ also plays a key role in drought induced accumulation of proline . the drought treatment used resulted in a reduction of relative water content from to in wild type plants compared to a _PROTEIN_ in rwc from to in the _PROTEIN_ mutants . the greater than fivefold reduction of proline accumulation thus correlated with a _PROTEIN_ in rwc of only in the _PROTEIN_ mutants . the _PROTEIN_ that water loss in detached leaves was similar in wild type and _PROTEIN_ mutants supported the conclusion that proline accumulation is not a critical _PROTEIN_ in complex control of rwc . to assess the effects of _PROTEIN_ mutations on plant growth under salt stress we performed comparative assays of germination root elongation seedling growth and induction of chlorosis using wild type and _PROTEIN_ plants grown either in the absence or presence of or mm nacl . germination rates of wild type and _PROTEIN_ seeds were similar under all conditions tested indicating that _PROTEIN_ plays no role in the control of seed germination . whereas root elongation rates of wild type and _PROTEIN_ seedlings were comparable without salt treatment the _PROTEIN_ mutants displayed and reduction of root growth rate compared to wild type in the presence of and mm nacl respectively . the _PROTEIN_ mutants also displayed lower salt tolerance in other assays monitoring leaf development fresh weight accumulation and plant survival . enhanced bleaching and subsequent death of _PROTEIN_ mutants was observed in the presence of mm nacl which affected but did not prevent the growth and survival of wild type seedlings . induction of leaf chlorosis in the salt treated _PROTEIN_ mutants suggested an increase of oxidative damage by enhanced generation of reactive oxygen species . hence we compared ros levels in leaves of salt treated wild type and _PROTEIN_ plants using a histochemical assay with diaminobenzidine . leaves of wild type and _PROTEIN_ mutant plants grown without salt showed comparable levels of dab staining in vascular tissues . upon h exposure to mm nacl dab staining was also detected in mesophyll tissues of leaf blades and showed higher intensity in the _PROTEIN_ mutants than in wild type indicating enhanced hydrogen peroxide accumulation . to confirm that salt hypersensitivity of _PROTEIN_ mutants indeed reflected insufficient proline accumulation we measured the salt mediated inhibition of root elongation of _PROTEIN_ mutants grown in either the absence or presence of externally provided proline . remarkably addition of mm proline to the medium alleviated the salt dependent root growth defects of _PROTEIN_ mutants indicating a causal relationship between reduced salt tolerance and impaired proline accumulation . to prove unequivocally that the salt hypersensitivity phenotype was caused by the _PROTEIN_ mutations we performed genetic complementation assays . the coding sequence of green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ was inserted into the wild type _PROTEIN_ gene by precisely replacing its stop codon and the resulting _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ reporter gene was introduced by the agrobacterium binary vector into the homozygous _PROTEIN_ mutants . salt dependent proline accumulation in the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutants reached of control wild type levels . the salt sensitivity of genetically complemented homozygous _PROTEIN_ mutants _PROTEIN_ was similar to that of wild type indicating correct regulation of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ construct . in comparison to wild type prolonged salt stress led to enhanced chlorosis of _PROTEIN_ mutants . whereas total leaf chlorophyll contents of wild type and _PROTEIN_ plants were similar on salt free medium the chlorophyll content following h treatment with mm nacl was reduced by in wild type compared to a reduction in _PROTEIN_ plants . treatment with mm nacl _PROTEIN_ the chlorophyll content by in wild type compared to a reduction in _PROTEIN_ plants . the significant increase in chlorophyll degradation provided an indication of enhanced oxidative damage in the salt stressed _PROTEIN_ mutants . quantitative measurement of dab reactions in leaves indicated an increase in hydrogen peroxide accumulation of about twofold in the _PROTEIN_ mutants compared to wild type in response to treatment with mm nacl for h . because lipid peroxidation is a direct consequence of ros accumulation we monitored the levels of malonaldehyde in leaves of control and salt treated plants . lipid peroxidation was similar in non stressed _PROTEIN_ and wild type and did not increase significantly in salt stressed wild type plants . however in the _PROTEIN_ mutants malonaldehyde levels were twofold higher than in wild type plants upon h treatment with mm nacl correlating with the observed increase in hydrogen peroxide levels . enhancement of lipid peroxidation suggests considerable oxidative _LOCATION_ damage during stress in the _PROTEIN_ mutants . ros levels are controlled by a well defined detoxification system which involves a number of enzymes that reduce the amount of reactive oxygen species . to monitor ros detoxification the activities of catalase superoxide dismutase glutathione s transferase _PROTEIN_ glutathione reductase _PROTEIN_ ascorbate peroxidase and guaiacol peroxidase were measured in leaves of wild type and _PROTEIN_ plants that were subjected to mm nacl treatment for h in hydroponic cultures . catalase eliminates hydrogen peroxide and is one of the most important detoxifying enzymes during oxidative stress . on average an increase in catalase activity was detected in the _PROTEIN_ mutants compared to a increase in wild type during salt stress . gpx activities showed only marginal enhancement in the mutants whereas sod activities mediating the reduction of superoxide radicals to hydrogen peroxide were slightly reduced in _PROTEIN_ plants . the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and apx enzymes which act in the stress regulated glutathione ascorbate cycle showed higher activities in wild type compared to an increase of only in the salt treated _PROTEIN_ mutants indicating that this detoxifying pathway did not function to such an extent in the mutants . control northern hybridizations did not reveal alterations in transcript levels of _PROTEIN_ and apx genes in the _PROTEIN_ mutants suggesting that the observed changes in these enzyme activities did not reflect alterations at the level of transcription . to determine the effects of _PROTEIN_ knockout mutations we have characterized two _PROTEIN_ alleles identified in the gabi kat and _PROTEIN_ insertion mutant collections . the _PROTEIN_ allele carries a single t dna insertion in intron _PROTEIN_ whereas the _PROTEIN_ allele _PROTEIN_ contains a t dna tag disrupting exon _PROTEIN_ . pcr screening for homozygous lines in the segregating and mutant families failed to identify homozygous _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ progeny . in the presence of sulfadiazine or kanamycin _PROTEIN_ the hemizygous families showed segregation of resistant versus sensitive seedlings . inspection of siliques of hemizygous _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants revealed segregation of wild type and collapsed seeds . in immature green siliques a similar segregation of green and white seeds was observed . between days and after pollination depending on the humidity levels all white seeds collapsed and turned brown rapidly . examination of cleared seeds revealed that embryo development was considerably delayed in white mutant seeds . after reaching either torpedo stage at humidity or u shape stage at humidity the embryos in white seeds of both _PROTEIN_ insertion mutants ceased growing and aborted . when dissected aseptically and cultured in the presence of mm proline both green and white seeds germinated to viable seedlings . in the absence of proline however white seeds either did not germinate or produced arrested white seedlings . about of seedlings derived from white seeds germinating in the presence of proline displayed developmental abnormalities such as aberrantly shaped cotyledons and leaves . pcr genotyping revealed that seedlings obtained from white seeds were homozygous for the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutations whereas seedlings from green seeds corresponded to either hemizygous or wild type progeny . rt pcr analysis of rna templates isolated from single leaves of homozygous _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ seedlings did not detect _PROTEIN_ transcript indicating that t dna insertions in both exon and intron caused null mutations of the _PROTEIN_ gene . the embryo lethal phenotype of these mutations suggests that the loss of _PROTEIN_ function results in proline auxotrophy during embryogenesis . the _PROTEIN_ mutations also affected plant development after germination . when grown on proline containing medium the mutants showed extremely slow growth and upon transfer into soil they grew as dwarfs with aberrant rosettes for weeks but ultimately decayed even when treated with proline under optimal growth conditions . as described for the _PROTEIN_ mutants we also performed genetic complementation of the _PROTEIN_ mutation with a _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ reporter gene . hemizygous _PROTEIN_ plants were transformed with agrobacterium vector carrying a _PROTEIN_ gene in which the stop codon was replaced with a precise fusion of _METHOD_ coding sequences . families of transformed lines were screened for _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and segregation of homozygous _PROTEIN_ mutant plants . the genetic complementation tests yielded homozygous _PROTEIN_ lines _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein and the phenotype and viability of these lines were similar to wild type plants . this result confirmed that the _PROTEIN_ mutation was indeed responsible for the observed embryo and seedling lethality traits and indicated that the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein conferred restoration of the mutant to the wild type phenotype . interestingly in one of the transformed families _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ all offspring were homozygous for the _PROTEIN_ mutation suggesting that agrobacterium transformation took place before fertilization of the mutant ovule with a mutant pollen generating a complemented homozygous embryo . although the observed effects of _PROTEIN_ mutations were consistent with the previously suggested regulatory role of _PROTEIN_ in stress induced proline synthesis the lethality of the _PROTEIN_ mutations predicted that _PROTEIN_ might have a distinct function in embryo and seedling development . however neither hybridization analyses of the organ specific distribution of transcripts nor studies of spatial and temporal _PROTEIN_ patterns of promoter gus reporter fusions provided sufficiently high resolution to confirm this model . therefore we performed in situ hybridizations of embryo sections using gene specific probes . these experiments revealed the presence of both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ transcripts during all stages of embryogenesis . because all hybridizations were performed under identical conditions differences in signal intensity indicated that the levels of _PROTEIN_ transcript compared to _PROTEIN_ were somewhat higher throughout embryo development especially in heart and torpedo stages . thus abortion of _PROTEIN_ mutant embryos could not be explained by down regulation of _PROTEIN_ transcription during embryogenesis . monitoring temporal and spatial _PROTEIN_ patterns of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ constructs in which the translation stop codons of genes were replaced by coding sequences of enhanced _METHOD_ _METHOD_ demonstrated that both _METHOD_ proteins were synthesized at all stages of embryogenesis . however _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ displayed a remarkable dotted pattern in embryonic cells contrasting with the homogeneous cytoplasmic distribution of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . high resolution confocal laser scanning microscopy revealed that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was sequestered into subcellular bodies which showed no co localization with chloroplasts mitochondria or _LOCATION_ . the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ proteins share sequence identity but none of the regions with amino acid exchanges were found to correspond to known secretion and sorting signals using various signal peptide predicting programmes . our experiments also excluded artificial vesicular targeting of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ because both _METHOD_ gene fusions were generated by preserving all native transcription and translation regulatory elements . the aberrant leaf and rosette development of proline rescued _PROTEIN_ mutant seedlings suggested that the _PROTEIN_ mutations also affect _PROTEIN_ stages of plant development . therefore we characterized spatial regulation of _METHOD_ reporter constructs throughout the entire life cycle . in day old seedlings only very low levels of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were observed in the cotyledons and hypocotyls . by contrast _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was detected in all seedling organs at particularly high levels in shoot tips and in vascular tissues of cotyledons and hypocotyls . remarkably _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ appeared to be a specific early marker for leaf primordia in the apical _METHOD_ of seedlings and auxiliary leaf buds of rosettes in which _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was not _PROTEIN_ . in inflorescence _METHOD_ flower primordia and flower buds _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ generally exceeded the levels of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . in flowers _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was present only in anthers while _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ could also be detected in anthers stamen filaments sepals and _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ showed specific _PROTEIN_ in tissue layers carrying pollen mother cells in the stamens as well as in pollen grains . in comparison _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was only _PROTEIN_ in the vegetative cells of stamens . in whole mount roots confocal imaging of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ detected only dotted patterns of subcellular bodies whereas _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ showed cytoplasmic localization accompanied by the appearance of some dots in few cells of the root elongation zone . in response to treatment of seedlings with mm nacl for h in _METHOD_ medium the number and _METHOD_ intensity of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ dots significantly increased in the root elongation and root hair differentiation zones . in root tips where _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ showed very low level of _PROTEIN_ some increase in _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ levels was observed upon salt treatment whereas in the root elongation zone _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ levels were low and apparently unaffected by salt treatment . immunolocalization of _METHOD_ proteins in root cross sections by indirect _METHOD_ detection of anti _METHOD_ antibody using an fitc labelled second antibody identified the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein only in subcellular bodies within cells of the central cylinder whereas the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein showed clear cytoplasmic localization in all root cell types . co staining of _LOCATION_ with propidium iodide indicated that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ is not localized in _LOCATION_ although accumulation of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in smaller pro _LOCATION_ could not be completely excluded . in mesophyll cells of intact leaves _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ showed similar distribution in both cytoplasm and chloroplasts . treatment of seedlings with mm nacl for h led to the re localization of over of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signal into chloroplasts whereas the _METHOD_ intensity of cytoplasmic _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signal was only marginally reduced by the salt treatment . preparation of leaf mesophyll protoplasts by cell wall digestion in a medium containing m of mannitol resulted in quantitative re localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ into chloroplasts as indicated by the orange colour of overlapping green _METHOD_ and chloroplast derived red _METHOD_ signals . by contrast the chloroplasts were connected with threads of a thin green layer of cytoplasm in optical cross sections of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ protoplasts . higher resolution images through the chloroplast layer confirmed exclusive chloroplast localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ whereas orange images of chloroplasts surrounded by a green network of cytoplasm indicated high residual levels of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in the cytoplasm . in conclusion differential localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ proteins in various cell types and at the subcellular level supported the genetic data showing that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ perform non overlapping functions .
