the protein processing pathway is an essential mechanism found in all _METHOD_ . however it is widely believed that deformylase a key enzyme involved in this process in bacteria does not exist in eukaryotes thus making it a target for antibacterial agents such as actinonin . in an attempt to define this process in higher eukaryotes we have used arabidopsis thaliana as a model organism . two deformylase cdnas the first identified in any eukaryotic system and six distinct methionine aminopeptidase cdnas were cloned . the corresponding proteins were characterized in vivo and in vitro . methionine aminopeptidases were found in the cytoplasm and in the organelles while deformylases were localized in the organelles only . our work shows that higher plants have a much more complex machinery for methionine removal than previously suspected . we were also able to identify deformylase homologues from several animals and clone the corresponding cdna from human cells . our data provide the first evidence that lower and higher eukaryotes as well as bacteria share a similar protein processing machinery indicating universality of this system .
enzymes displaying map activity are classified into two groups _PROTEIN_ and . proteins of the _PROTEIN_ group were first identified in eubacteria . yeast and mammalian cells also possess a _PROTEIN_ both show the same catalytic core as bacterial _PROTEIN_ and have including two conserved zinc fingers . eukaryotic enzymes also have extensions compared with those found in archaea . both _PROTEIN_ and are located in the cytoplasm of eukaryotes . nevertheless it has been suggested that the favour the interaction of the catalytic core with particular targets . although the sequence similarity between the two map types is very low the structures of the catalytic core are homologous . bacterial pdf proteins are metalloproteases of kda with an unusual metal binding site . there are two of pdf _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ both containing two signature sequences and the hexxh motif of the zinc metalloproteases superfamily . using blast analysis we searched the genome sequence of a.thaliana for sequences similar to pdf and/or map genes . because of the variability of the we chose to restrict our primary analysis to the catalytic domains of the two enzymes . consequently the sequences of escherichia coli _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ pyrococcus furiosus and bacillus stearothermophilus _PROTEIN_ were used as primary input inquiries . four _PROTEIN_ sequences _PROTEIN_ one sequence _PROTEIN_ and one _PROTEIN_ sequence _PROTEIN_ were retrieved . this result was unexpected since sequences have only previously been found in prokaryotic genomes . moreover such a large number of map genes was surprising in an organism believed to have a low gene redundancy . in comparison similar analysis with the complete genome of c.elegans which has approximately the same size and gene number as a.thaliana and with s.cerevisiae revealed no pdf and only one _PROTEIN_ and one sequence . using rapid analysis of cdna ends _PROTEIN_ we cloned the corresponding cdnas . the catalytic cores of the _PROTEIN_ are very similar to the bacterial counterparts . _PROTEIN_ closely resembles the yeast enzyme whereas _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ displayed unique but were very similar to each other around amino acid positions . the homology extended through the catalytic domain . most interestingly these three _PROTEIN_ lack the zinc finger of _PROTEIN_ . deletion of this in yeast _PROTEIN_ yielded an enzyme with full map activity in vitro but unable to complement a mutant in vivo . finally _PROTEIN_ also carried an residue extension not found in bacterial pdf . the corresponding genes were mapped in the a.thaliana genome . genome sequence analysis showed that there is a short partial and duplication of an internal sequence of _PROTEIN_ on chromosome and the gene is duplicated with one copy on chromosome _PROTEIN_ and another on chromosome _PROTEIN_ . the cdna of _PROTEIN_ was cloned . the two cdnas encode proteins . the seven cloned cdna sequences _PROTEIN_ were used to screen the many plant genomic and _PROTEIN_ sequence tags sequences available at http . several partial sequences encoding homologues of _PROTEIN_ and were identified in rice alfalfa soybean tomato sorghum corn and pine . the plant _PROTEIN_ closely resemble their animal and fungal counterparts with similar and conservation of the histidines and cysteines of the zinc finger motif . likewise from plants is similar to enzymes in the other _METHOD_ . homologues of _PROTEIN_ and were found in the same plants . interestingly at least three distinct _PROTEIN_ sequences related to a.thaliana map and were identified in rice . this suggests that the map sequence set obtained from a.thaliana is representative of the general situation in other plants both dicots and monocots . a similar analysis was performed with the sequence of a.thaliana _PROTEIN_ . very similar sequences were found in tomato rice poplar and corn . the _PROTEIN_ from tomato was cloned by construction of an l.esculentum _PROTEIN_ library . the catalytic domain of this complete _PROTEIN_ sequence is identical to a.thaliana _PROTEIN_ and the extensions are similar . two divergent partial _PROTEIN_ sequences _PROTEIN_ were found in a rice genomic fragment and in a tomato est . these _PROTEIN_ sequences exhibited only identity with the catalytic domain of _PROTEIN_ and do not display the long insertion and the variable loop found in _PROTEIN_ . thus both the rice and tomato genomes include two distinct pdfs _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . we were able to isolate the cdna encoding tomato _PROTEIN_ by screening our _PROTEIN_ tomato library . the resulting sequence information was used to identify and clone the a.thaliana _PROTEIN_ which at the time of our initial analyses had not yet been covered in the arabidopsis genome database . the amino acid sequence of a.thaliana _PROTEIN_ is indeed similar to l.esculentum _PROTEIN_ . our data above suggested the existence of unknown mrnas encoding map _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and pdf _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ homologues in plants . nevertheless we had no evidence that these transcripts encoded functional proteins with map or pdf activity . as plant _PROTEIN_ and pdf resembled their eubacterial counterparts we tested whether they complement map or def defects in e.coli . a strain was already available _PROTEIN_ and we constructed a similar strain _PROTEIN_ . the three _PROTEIN_ cdnas isolated from a.thaliana under the control of the lac promoter indeed complemented the map defect . _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in strain _PROTEIN_ did not allow bacterial growth at a temperature . to check the production of the protein the protein fused to the tag was _PROTEIN_ in e.coli . this plasmid initially failed to complement the thermosensitivity of _PROTEIN_ . western blot analysis with tag antibodies indicated that _PROTEIN_ was produced but remained in the insoluble fraction as inclusion bodies . indeed the domain of the protein is hydrophobic . therefore we made a construct encoding only the catalytic domain . the protein produced was soluble and the plasmid complemented the strain . a crude extract of the strain producing the catalytic domain of _PROTEIN_ was assayed for group cleavage using two synthetic peptides and . its activity was > higher than the control extract and the addition of nickel improved the stability and linearity of the enzyme kinetics . these characteristics are consistent with those of bacterial pdf and show that _PROTEIN_ has peptide deformylase activity . finally sequences encoding both protein and the truncated catalytic domain of _PROTEIN_ were fused to the tag . both constructs complemented the strain _PROTEIN_ . a crude protein extract containing the catalytic domain showed a strong stimulation of deformylation activity with a synthetic peptide compared with the control . altogether the above data demonstrated that the various cloned cdnas _PROTEIN_ distinct proteins displaying either map or pdf activity similar to those found in bacterial cells . the unexpected occurrence of six maps and two pdfs raised the question concerning their relative _PROTEIN_ in various tissues from a.thaliana . poly mrnas were therefore prepared from fruits leaves flowers and roots . _PROTEIN_ was systematically compared with that of elongation _PROTEIN_ a housekeeping gene . quantitative reverse transcription pcr experiments were performed to confirm the results . the sizes of seven of the eight mrnas _PROTEIN_ studied matched perfectly the length of the cloned cdna . however the _PROTEIN_ mrna was bp and not bp as expected . primer extension analysis in and directions revealed that the extremity of the _PROTEIN_ cdna which was selected as the longest clone was longer than that of the average mrnas . as a consequence the first aug codon of the _PROTEIN_ mrnas may thus correspond to the second _PROTEIN_ codon of the cloned cdna . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mrnas were all present and with a difference of abundance between and in the various tissues . in contrast _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mrnas were strongly induced in green tissues i.e . leaves and flowers . finally we noted that the amount of _PROTEIN_ was very low < of that found for _PROTEIN_ . various prediction software including chlorop signalp psort and predotar were used to analyse the function of the domains . the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were predicted to contain targeting signals . in particular they contain the high level of hydroxylated residues that is a feature of plant organellar targeting signals . it has been suggested that the extensions of _PROTEIN_ and are involved in subcellular cytoplasmic targeting . to determine the subcellular localization of the various proteins their extensions as defined by comparison with the bacterial enzymes _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were fused to green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ . the constructs were _PROTEIN_ transiently in epidermal onion cells after biolistic delivery . onion cells possess low intrinsic red chlorophyll _METHOD_ of chloroplasts and have large and regular cells allowing the different compartments to be easily visualized by microscopy . _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was monitored by _METHOD_ microscopy and confocal laser scanning microscopy . production of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ fusions resulted in _METHOD_ _METHOD_ throughout the cytoplasm a pattern similar to that obtained with _METHOD_ alone . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were localized in both chloroplasts and mitochondria . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was only found in chloroplasts . as a control for _LOCATION_ localization we used a fusion of _METHOD_ to _LOCATION_ lipid monogalactosyldiacylglycerol _PROTEIN_ synthase from spinacia oleracea a _LOCATION_ protein shown to be located in chloroplasts by immunolocalization methods . in the onion cell system _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusions were efficiently targeted to _LOCATION_ and the _METHOD_ pattern was indistinguishable from that of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusions . this _METHOD_ the _LOCATION_ localization of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . all three fusions were also found in stromules . stromules are _LOCATION_ connections that appeared as _METHOD_ tubules emanating from the _LOCATION_ surface . they are known to be abundant in tissues that contain _LOCATION_ such as onion cells . in our experiments _METHOD_ flowed through stromules suggesting that _PROTEIN_ proteins are translocated between interconnected _LOCATION_ . these observations are consistent with a system of coordination of _LOCATION_ activities by communication . the _PROTEIN_ mrnas include two putative alternative aug start codons . this phenomenon can be the basis for routing a protein to distinct cell compartments . three constructions in which the various _PROTEIN_ codons are the first aug of the transcript were constructed . all three constructs resulted in a mitochondrial localization of _METHOD_ . the mitochondrial localization was confirmed by labelling experiments in the presence of mitotracker a specific mitochondrial probe . in the case of the construct with the most downstream start codon which corresponds to the most abundant transcript many positive cells were observed and the _METHOD_ signal was stronger . arabidopsis thaliana _PROTEIN_ like _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ was found in _LOCATION_ and mitochondria . this double localization in the case of _PROTEIN_ was further confirmed with a fusion of the of tomato _PROTEIN_ fused to _METHOD_ . from the above localization data it thus appears that the process of removal of the first methionine occurs not only in the cytoplasm but also in the organelles of plants . in this context we compared the protein sequences of several organelle gene products with the corresponding dna genome data . a majority of the proteins indeed lacked the or . some organellar _LOCATION_ proteins apparently retained their a situation also observed in eubacteria . analysis of the specificity with which methionine removal occurs in plants fits perfectly with the known selectivity of eubacterial map and pdf . the discovery of a novel pathway dedicated to methionine removal in higher plants raised the question of its existence in other eukaryotes . interestingly a gene encoding a pdf homologue was identified in the _LOCATION_ genome of plasmodium falciparum a eukaryotic protist related to green algae . this pdf has an and is very similar to _PROTEIN_ the _LOCATION_ pdf form . together with our results this phylogeny strongly suggests that the p.falciparum _PROTEIN_ is routed to the apicoplast the _LOCATION_ of apicomplexan protists . taking advantage of our data on map we also found an organellar _PROTEIN_ on chromosome of p.falciparum . in addition one organellar _PROTEIN_ gene on chromosome and one mitochondrial _PROTEIN_ sequence on chromosome could be identified in the genome of a protist devoid of _LOCATION_ the soil amoeba dictyostelium discoideum . very recently the near complete genome of the fruit fly drosophila was made available . one _PROTEIN_ and one sequence were retrieved indeed all eukaryotes have these two genes . unexpectedly a search for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ homologues identified one gene on chromosome . it is very similar to the three plant organellar _PROTEIN_ including the sequence along the domain . in addition it did not contain the zinc finger that characterizes all known cytoplasmic _PROTEIN_ . thus the fruit fly appears to have an map and consequently an protein processing pathway in mitochondria . this suggests that the drosophila genome may also have a gene encoding a pdf with an targeting . indeed two adjacent pdf sequences were identified on chromosome . the annotated deduced protein which is derived from the fusion of the two genes appears however to be incorrectly processed . of the data using various tools available at http //www.fruitfly.org/seq_tools/splice.html suggested that there are actually two genes encoding two pdfs with different extended . in addition a _PROTEIN_ box and two signals were found in between the two genes . the analysis of two ests from another insect of the dipter an order the african malaria mosquito anopheles gambiae strengthened this prediction . these ests were overlapping which allowed us to reconstitute one nearly complete cdna . the deduced protein corresponded to that of one of the two pdf sequences found in the drosophila genome . the amino acid homology continued upstream of the proposed splicing site within the sequence translated from the putative intron . we concluded that the fly genome encodes two _PROTEIN_ with distinct . although this situation appears to be similar to that of higher plants both fly sequences are most related to the mitochondrial form i.e . _PROTEIN_ . the above data were highly suggestive that a machinery required for methionine removal occurs not only in higher plant organelles but also in the mitochondria of insects . such a result was completely unexpected and led us to wonder whether mammalian cells also possess such a system . pdf was a better marker for this machinery than map since _PROTEIN_ sequences are found in all _METHOD_ . because pdf is thought to be a good target for new antibiotics and given that substantial human genome sequence is now available we looked for pdf homologues in human . using _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ as input sequences we searched the complete human est and genome data . analysis of the ests produced a family of five candidates . two clearly came from bacterial dna contamination whereas the three others were associated with additional related sequences in unigene . with the help of these ests we identified the associated gene fragment composed of two exons on human chromosome . we cloned the corresponding cdna from human fetal tissues by _PROTEIN_ . the deduced pdf was very similar to insect and a.thaliana _PROTEIN_ i.e . the mitochondrial pdf . data from serial analysis of gene _PROTEIN_ of unigene at http //www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sage/ revealed that this sequence was _PROTEIN_ at the same level in all types of tissues in human a situation similar to that of arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ . we also searched the mouse est and identified four sequences related to human _PROTEIN_ . the clone corresponding to the longest insertion was and the sequence extended . although the cdna insertion was partial it was quite similar to the human _PROTEIN_ homologue . finally homologues of the human _PROTEIN_ sequence were also found in the rattus norvegicus est library and in a partial genome sequence of the freshwater pufferfish tetraodon nigroviridis . these data show that the mitochondrial _PROTEIN_ homologue is constitutively _PROTEIN_ in many animal cells . it is therefore likely that animal cells possess the machinery of protein processing that we identified and characterized for the first time in higher plants .
the bacterial strains and plasmids used are shown in table iii . _PROTEIN_ was constructed as follows . plasmid which bears a kb smai psti fragment _PROTEIN_ the whole e.coli map gene was digested with hpai which cleaves within the beginning of the map open reading frame . it was then ligated to two complementary oligonucleotides which introduce a unique bamhi restriction site an taa translation stop codon and a base frame shift . this yielded plasmid which _PROTEIN_ a truncated inactive map . the saci psti fragment of was then between the same sites of to yield . using the procedure described by citation we constructed using strain as starting material strain _PROTEIN_ . this strain was made recombination deficient by conjugation with the hfr strain . this yielded _PROTEIN_ . at temperature this strain fails to grow on luria bertani plates . at the strain grows . arabidopsis thaliana seeds were sown after surface sterilization on murashige and skoog medium containing agarose and incubated in a growth chamber for up to weeks . alternatively for growth seeds were directly sown on soil or sand and grown in a greenhouse . lycopersicon esculentum was grown in a greenhouse for month . restriction enzymes and dna ligase were _PROTEIN_ from new england biolabs and bethesda research laboratories . buffers used were those indicated by the suppliers . oligonucleotides were synthesized by . a geneamp pcr system was used for all pcr analyses . nucleotide sequences were determined by the terminator method with dna templates purified with the qiagen . kit and analysed on a sequencing system _METHOD_ . nucleotide sequence data are available at ddbj/embl/genbank under accession nos and . dna was extracted from seedlings by using the dneasy plant maxi kit . rna was prepared from a.thaliana tissues as described previously . the rnas were further purified with an rneasy kit . poly rna samples for electrophoresis were prepared with the oligotex kit . rna concentrations were quantified by measuring absorbance at nm and equal amounts were by electrophoresis through formaldehyde agarose gels prior to transfer to nylon _LOCATION_ . transcript sizes were assessed by comparison with two rna ladders after staining with methylene blue . an oligolabelling kit was used to label probes with the various cdnas as templates and datp and dctp . probes were purified with the qiaquick nucleotide removal kit . northern and southern blotting were performed as described with stringent hybridization and washing . radioactivity was revealed with phosphor screens on a phosphorimager . the systematic lower signal of the mrnas in siliques is likely to be due to the accumulation of mrnas encoding seed storage proteins . this was verified by using a probe that hybridized strongly with the silique mrna lane only . rt pcr analyses were performed using the superscript kit with oligonucleotides the sequence of which overlapped two adjacent exon borders to avoid cross amplification with contaminant genomic dna . after gel electrophoresis blotting and hybridization radioactivity associated with the amplified fragments was quantified on a phosphorimager . quantitative results were used to confirm the data obtained with northern blot experiments . _PROTEIN_ involved libraries from a.thaliana seedlings and l.esculentum young leaves constructed starting from of poly mrna purified from total rna with the poly quick mrna isolation kit . the cdna amplification kit and the recommendations of the manufacturer were used for the construction of both _PROTEIN_ libraries . the _PROTEIN_ library from human fetus was _PROTEIN_ from clontech . screening for the and extremities involved nested pcr using the advantage cdna pcr kit for the first amplification step and the pcr kit or pfuturbo dna polymerase for the second amplification . amplification experiments of _PROTEIN_ led to three pcr products . random cloning showed that one of the pcr products was a consequence of mrnas incorrectly spliced at the level of intron . about one half of the cloned cdnas corresponded to fragments either containing the intron or with incorrect splicing at this level the intron being shifted by and bases upstream of the authentic acceptor and donor sites respectively . both aberrant and wrongly spliced mrnas encoded greatly truncated proteins that were expected to be inactive . similarly of the pcr products of _PROTEIN_ showed a lack of cleavage of their intron . finally two different pcr products were found for a.thaliana _PROTEIN_ . the difference concerned the untranslated sequence one of the two transcripts showed splicing of the terminal intron whereas the other did not . rt pcr experiments indicated that the unspliced transcript accounted for of the mrnas . pcr products were further cloned in pbluescriptsk or pebnb . in most cases a dozen of the longest clones were analysed and half were sequenced . the longest clones were used for the reconstruction of the cdnas . this was achieved in two steps using an internal unique restriction site except for _PROTEIN_ where three steps were necessary . cells _PROTEIN_ the given plasmid were grown at for h in lb medium supplemented with ampicillin until the reached . cells were induced with mm and left for another h under agitation . the cells were then in mm ph mm nacl broken by and centrifuged for min in an eppendorf microfuge at . the supernatant was collected and vol . mixed with vol . of loading buffer _PROTEIN_ . the pellet was and solubilized in the same buffer . protein concentrations were measured according to citation with the protein assay kit . immunoglobulin g was used as the protein standard . the iii system was used for polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis _PROTEIN_ on _PROTEIN_ denaturing gels _PROTEIN_ . gels were stained with _METHOD_ stain . proteins were on nitrocellulose _LOCATION_ with a wet transfer unit in the cold room . western blots with mouse monoclonal antibodies and antibodies from sheep were developed with the ecl detection reagents and _METHOD_ . peptide deformylase activity assay was coupled to formate dehydrogenase essentially as described . pdf activity was assayed at as the increase of the absorbance at nm of nadh . the standard assay was performed in a final volume of with a cm optical path . the absorbance change was measured with an ultrospec spectrophotometer . the reaction mixtures contained mm hepes ph mm or mm nad mm and u/ml yeast formate dehydrogenase . the reaction was started by the addition of of crude bacterial extract diluted in mm hepes ph . two plasmids _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus promoter were used and _PROTEIN_ transiently in plant cells . both encoded soluble highly _METHOD_ variants of _METHOD_ for use in higher plants . in addition to the and substitutions borne by both constructs _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ differed at amino acid position _METHOD_ bearing the substitution causing an increased _METHOD_ output and higher _PROTEIN_ levels . note that of the _METHOD_ region of these plasmids allowed us to identify a unique xbai restriction site just upstream from the bamhi site . biolistic bombardments were performed with a _PROTEIN_ instrument . acceleration of gold coated with of pure plasmid dna spotted on was used to transform onion epidermal cells . bombardment parameters were as follows vacuum inches hg distance to target cm helium pressure p.s.i . onion scales were left for h in the dark at and epidermal tissues removed and layered in water on glass slides for microscopy . the tissues were examined under a reichert _METHOD_ microscope and then a confocal microscope . for the reichert _METHOD_ microscope _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was observed by using the filters _PROTEIN_ nm nm and nm . confocal microscopy was carried out using a confocal laser scanning microscope running on a silicongraphics indy workstation . the confocal microscope was equipped with a mw argon laser a eflp short pass filter for excitation and an upright nikon microscope . a reflect short pass filter was used to separate the emission beam in two . _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was collected through a bandpass filter . in some experiments mitotracker red cmxros was used to stain mitochondria . the dye was added to a final concentration of . mitotracker red _METHOD_ was collected through the and a long pass filter _METHOD_ . images were generated using kalman averaging and or nikon oil objectives with na .
