fertilization in flowering plants requires the temporal and spatial coordination of many developmental processes including pollen production anther dehiscence ovule production and pollen tube elongation . however it remains elusive as to how this coordination occurs during reproduction . here we present evidence that endocytosis involving heterotetrameric _PROTEIN_ protein complex plays a crucial role in fertilization . an arabidopsis thaliana mutant _PROTEIN_ displays multiple defects in pollen production and viability as well as elongation of staminal filaments and pollen tubes all of which are pivotal processes needed for fertilization . of these abnormalities the defects in elongation of staminal filaments and pollen tubes were partially rescued by exogenous auxin . moreover _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was greatly reduced in filaments and anthers in _PROTEIN_ mutant plants . at the cellular level _PROTEIN_ mutants displayed defects in both endocytosis of n pyridinium dibromide a lypophilic dye used as an endocytosis marker and _PROTEIN_ localization of auxin efflux carrier _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in the stamen filaments . moreover these defects were phenocopied by treatment with tyrphostin an inhibitor of endocytosis . based on these results we propose that ap dependent endocytosis plays a crucial role in coordinating the multiple developmental aspects of male reproductive organs by modulating cellular auxin level through the regulation of the amount and _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ .
to gain insight into the physiological role of ap mediated endocytosis in plants we initially identified the components of ap and their localization . in animals the endocytic _PROTEIN_ ap complex is formed by assembly of four distinct types of subunits _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . the arabidopsis genome contains two genes named _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ which show high sequence homology and structural similarity to animal _PROTEIN_ . to test whether these two proteins are _PROTEIN_ of ap in plants we tagged _PROTEIN_ with yellow _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ at the c terminus and examined its localization . previously the c terminally _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ localized to the pm and _LOCATION_ in animals . we generated the transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ from the native promoter or cauliflower mosaic virus promoter and confirmed that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was detected with both anti green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ and anti _PROTEIN_ antibodies at kd at the expected size . moreover the immunocomplex obtained with anti _METHOD_ antibody was recognized by anti _PROTEIN_ antibody . next we examined the localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ from the native promoter in root tissues . similar to the localization pattern of ap in animals _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was localized to the pm in addition to the _LOCATION_ . these results indicate that _PROTEIN_ is the _PROTEIN_ subunit of ap in arabidopsis . moreover the pm localized _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signals disappeared when root tissues were treated with tyrphostin an endocytosis inhibitor that prevents interaction between the motif of a cargo protein and _PROTEIN_ but not with tyrphostin used as a control . in addition the pm localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was also affected by wortmannin an inhibitor of phosphatidyl inositol kinase known to inhibit endocytosis . these results indicate that the interaction of ap with its cargo is critical for localization of ap to the pm . next we identified _PROTEIN_ of ap . the arabidopsis genome contains five _PROTEIN_ homologs . recently it has been shown that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ are _PROTEIN_ subunits of ap and is the _PROTEIN_ subunit of ap . sequence homology analysis revealed that _PROTEIN_ displayed the highest sequence homology to the animal of ap raising the possibility that _PROTEIN_ is the _PROTEIN_ subunit of ap in arabidopsis . to test this idea we generated transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ and protein extracts from these plants were used for immunoprecipitation with anti myc or anti hemagglutinin antibodies . the precipitates were analyzed by protein gel blotting using anti _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or anti _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ antibodies . _PROTEIN_ but not _PROTEIN_ was coprecipitated with anti myc antibody whereas _PROTEIN_ but not _PROTEIN_ was coprecipitated with anti ha antibody indicating that _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ of plant ap . to examine the subcellular distribution of _PROTEIN_ protein extracts from transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were separated into soluble and _LOCATION_ fractions by ultracentrifugation and these fractions were analyzed by protein gel blotting using anti myc antibody . _PROTEIN_ was detected in both fractions with in the soluble fraction and in the _LOCATION_ fraction indicating that _PROTEIN_ exists as soluble and _LOCATION_ associated _METHOD_ . ap is the _PROTEIN_ of clathrin for clathrin coated vesicles . to test this in plants we examined the interaction of ap with clathrin by coimmunoprecipitation . protein extracts from transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were used for coimmunoprecipitation with anti myc antibody and the precipitates were probed with anti clathrin heavy chain antibody . chc was detected in the precipitates of anti myc antibody indicating that ap interacts with clathrin . next we examined the place where this interaction occurs by in vivo imaging using _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and cyan _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ tagged clathrin light chain _METHOD_ after agrobacterium tumefaciens infiltration mediated transient _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in clc _METHOD_ transgenic plants . indeed both proteins localized to the pm in leaf and root hair cells . to quantify their colocalization we used the linear pearson moment product correlation coefficient and the nonlinear spearman rank correlation coefficient . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ closely colocalized with clc _METHOD_ in both cells . taken together these data suggest that ap is involved in ccv formation at the pm . the physiological role of ap in plants was examined genetically using knockout mutants or rna interference plants of ap components . first we identified two independent mutant alleles _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ which had a t dna insertion in exons and of _PROTEIN_ respectively . the absence of _PROTEIN_ transcripts was confirmed by rt pcr . next we examined the morphology of plants bearing the two alleles _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . both of them had more branches and produced small siliques . when quantified these small siliques in _PROTEIN_ plants contained only to seeds compared with seeds per primary inflorescence in the wild type . these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ has a crucial role in fertilization . in addition to this _PROTEIN_ mutants showed many developmental defects including abnormal _PROTEIN_ an increase in the number of shoots and branches smaller leaves an increase in the leaf number and shorter root hairs . to confirm that these phenotypes were caused by the mutation in _PROTEIN_ we examined whether _PROTEIN_ complements these phenotypes of the _PROTEIN_ plants . _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ under the native promoter in the background of _PROTEIN_ rescued all of these phenotypes confirming that these developmental defects are caused by the mutation in _PROTEIN_ . the genotype and _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in the complemented plants were confirmed by pcr . since ap is a heterotetrameric complex we tested whether mutation in _PROTEIN_ encoding _PROTEIN_ the largest subunit of ap exhibits the same phenotype . we employed the rnai approach to knockdown _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ using an _PROTEIN_ rnai construct that targeted both _PROTEIN_ genes _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ because _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are tandemly repeated next to each other on the same chromosome which makes it very difficult to obtain a double knockout mutant of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ levels in _PROTEIN_ rnai plants were examined by protein gel blot analysis using anti _PROTEIN_ antibody . multiple _PROTEIN_ rnai transgenic lines showed significantly reduced _PROTEIN_ protein levels . as a negative control we examined the _PROTEIN_ level using anti _PROTEIN_ antibody and found that the _PROTEIN_ levels in the rnai plants were the same as those in the wild type plants confirming the specificity of the _PROTEIN_ rnai construct . these _PROTEIN_ rnai plants exhibited the same phenotype as _PROTEIN_ mutants namely small siliques with only few seeds and abnormal _PROTEIN_ . these results confirm that ap plays an essential role in fertilization . of multiple abnormalities in _PROTEIN_ mutants we focused on defects in fertilization . fertilization involves many complex developmental processes such as pollen biogenesis in anthers the proper elongation of staminal filaments pollen tube elongation and the fertilization of the egg cells by sperm cells . to gain insights into the role of _PROTEIN_ in fertilization we examined which of these processes is affected in _PROTEIN_ plants . the amount of pollen produced in the anthers appeared to be greatly reduced in _PROTEIN_ plants . to look for defects in pollen quality the viability of pollen grains was tested using propidium iodide and fluorescein diacetate _PROTEIN_ which stain dead and live pollen respectively . dead pollen grains amounted to in _PROTEIN_ plants compared with only in the wild type . consistent with this finding pollination of wild type plants with _PROTEIN_ pollen produced only a few seeds as observed in _PROTEIN_ plants . interestingly the plant growth conditions affected the degree of defects in pollen viability the defect was much more severe in plants grown in a rooftop greenhouse than in those grown in an indoor greenhouse . previous studies have shown that growth conditions such as relative humidity affect pollen viability . in plants pollen biogenesis occurs through a lengthy pollen developmental process in the anther and can be divided into different stages . to define the exact step at which _PROTEIN_ is involved during pollen biogenesis ultrathin sections of anthers prepared at various developmental stages were examined by electron microscopy . until stage the _PROTEIN_ mutant plants did not display any noticeable difference to the wild type . however the most prominent difference was detected at stage when the central _LOCATION_ undergoes degeneration . in wild type pollen grains the cv was fragmented into numerous small _LOCATION_ < in diameter and uniformly distributed in the entire cellular space . in _PROTEIN_ pollen grains the cv was also fragmented into small _LOCATION_ . however some of them were still as large as in diameter and often the smaller _LOCATION_ were attached to each other indicating that _PROTEIN_ plays a role in pollen biogenesis via degeneration of the cv . thus it is possible that incomplete degeneration of the cv may lead to dead pollen . however this defect in pollen biogenesis may not account fully for the severe reduction in seed production since of _PROTEIN_ pollen was still alive according to _PROTEIN_ staining . to identify additional defects we examined pollen tube growth in vitro . indeed _PROTEIN_ pollen exhibited a severe defect in tube growth ex planta the average length of a pollen tube was with _PROTEIN_ pollen compared with with wild type pollen indicating that _PROTEIN_ also plays a crucial role in pollen tube elongation . another noticeable abnormality was the shorter length of the staminal filaments in _PROTEIN_ plants the length of stamen filaments was shorter than those of wild type plants so that pollen grains can not be easily delivered from the anther to the stigma . to determine the underlying cause of the shorter filament phenotype we examined the size of individual cells in the filaments . the length of individual cells was shorter in _PROTEIN_ plants than in wild type plants indicating that _PROTEIN_ plays a role in cell elongation in the staminal filaments . taken together these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ plants have defects in at least three different developmental processes including pollen biogenesis pollen tube elongation and elongation of staminal filaments which contribute collectively to the phenotype of severe reduction in seed production . consistent with this notion _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ at high levels in anthers filaments and pollen tubes as determined by _PROTEIN_ staining from transgenic plants harboring the _PROTEIN_ gus construct . the phenotypes of _PROTEIN_ plants in particular the defects in pollen production and filament elongation were reminiscent of the phenotypes of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ all of which have a defect in auxin biosynthesis or signaling raising the possibility that _PROTEIN_ mutants may also have a defect in _PROTEIN_ auxin levels . to test whether the failure of pollen elongation is also caused by low levels of auxin we examined the effect of exogenous auxin application on pollen tube elongation . indeed pollen germination and tube growth were restored upon application of auxin . these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ is involved in _PROTEIN_ auxin levels in anthers and during the growth of staminal filaments and pollen tube elongation . to further test this hypothesis we examined whether the _PROTEIN_ mutant plants had any alteration in cellular auxin levels . as a control we included a _PROTEIN_ mutant ethylene insensitive _PROTEIN_ that had a t dna insertion in _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ plants also showed the shorter filament phenotype in of flowers thus at a lesser degree compared with the _PROTEIN_ plants which had defective flowers at . next to confirm this finding we examined the _PROTEIN_ of auxin inducible genes in anthers and filaments . the _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ under the control of an auxin inducible promoter was greatly reduced in anthers and filaments of _PROTEIN_ plants compared with wild type plants . in both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ plants the _METHOD_ signals _PROTEIN_ from _METHOD_ in anthers and basal sides of the filaments were dramatically reduced to and respectively compared with the wild type plants indicating that auxin levels are altered in both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants albeit to a lesser degree in _PROTEIN_ plants . to further confirm that the reduced _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ plants is caused by a defect in auxin distribution we tested whether application of exogenous auxin can restore the _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ in these mutants . indeed the treatment of indole acetic acid for h restored the _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ partially in _PROTEIN_ plants and almost completely in _PROTEIN_ plants confirming that _PROTEIN_ plants have a defect in auxin distribution . the difference in severity of defects between the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants raises the possibility that auxin levels are also modulated by other _PROTEIN_ proteins in addition to _PROTEIN_ in stamens . in addition transcript levels of endogenous _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were significantly reduced . by contrast two gibberellin and two jasmonate inducible genes used as controls showed only slight or no reduction in their _PROTEIN_ . intriguingly the reduced length of _PROTEIN_ filaments was partially recovered by treatment with iaa indicating that the _PROTEIN_ mutant was defective in endogenous auxin levels . since ap is an _PROTEIN_ protein complex for clathrin mediated endocytosis we monitored endocytosis in the filaments of _PROTEIN_ plants using a lipophilic dye n pyridinium dibromide . as observed in the root cells of wild type plants rapidly enters endosomes as early as min after its application to the cells and accumulates in endosomes with almost no signal remaining at the pm . by contrast in _PROTEIN_ plants was almost exclusively restricted to the pm even min after application indicating that endocytosis is impaired in the _PROTEIN_ plants . moreover tyrphostin nearly completely inhibited endocytosis of in wild type filaments as observed in _PROTEIN_ plants supporting the idea that ap plays an important role in endocytosis in filaments . endocytosis plays an important role in _PROTEIN_ localization of the auxin efflux transporters of the _PROTEIN_ family . thus it is possible that the level and/or localization of _PROTEIN_ are affected in staminal filaments and pollen tubes of _PROTEIN_ plants . according to publicly available microarray data _PROTEIN_ showed the highest _PROTEIN_ in pollen and filaments whereas the _PROTEIN_ levels of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are moderate or barely detectable respectively . however _PROTEIN_ is reported to localize to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . accordingly to reveal a possible relationship to _PROTEIN_ function in filament growth we initially examined localization of _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ in the filaments . in wild type plants _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ localized to the pm . interestingly _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ showed _PROTEIN_ in its distribution with strong basal signals in of the cells . however in _PROTEIN_ filaments _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ showed a striking alteration in its localization thus revealing a punctate staining pattern along the pm . these results indicate that _PROTEIN_ plays a crucial role in _PROTEIN_ localization of _PROTEIN_ at the pm of the filaments . this is similar to the case with cells in the root cortex which also show a basal distribution in the pm . to confirm that the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ localization pattern in _PROTEIN_ plants is caused by a defect in endocytosis wild type filaments were treated with tyrphostin or tyrphostin as a control and the localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was examined after briefly staining with to visualize the pm . as observed in _PROTEIN_ plants tyrphostin but not tyrphostin treatment induced a punctate staining pattern of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ along the pm . to test whether _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ punctate stains localize at the pm we compared its localization with . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ positive punctate stains closely overlapped with . to quantify the colocalization we used the pearson correlation coefficient value and confirmed their close colocalization _PROTEIN_ which in turn confirmed the localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ at the pm . these results suggest that ap mediated endocytosis plays a crucial role in the proper distribution of _PROTEIN_ in the filaments . these results suggested that internalization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ from the pm is defective in _PROTEIN_ mutant plants . furthermore the punctate stains on the pm raised the possibility that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ accumulates at certain sites on the pm but can not be internalized . moreover this localization pattern _METHOD_ the idea that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ accumulates at specific site on the pm in the intact filaments . to confirm that _PROTEIN_ is internalized by endocytosis involving ap we examined the interaction of _PROTEIN_ with ap by coimmunoprecipitation using anti _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ antibody . _PROTEIN_ was detected in the immunocomplexes obtained with the anti _PROTEIN_ antibody confirming that ap interacts with _PROTEIN_ .

from salk institute genomic analysis laboratory . to generate the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ construct the promoter region and the _PROTEIN_ cdna were amplified by pcr using
