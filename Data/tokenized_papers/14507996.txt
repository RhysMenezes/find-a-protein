_PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is required for normal root and hypocotyl gravitropism . here we show that targeting _PROTEIN_ to the gravity perceiving cells of roots or hypocotyls is sufficient to rescue the gravitropic defects in the corresponding organs of _PROTEIN_ null mutants . the _LOCATION_ alkalinization of root cap columella cells that normally occurs very rapidly upon gravistimulation is lacking in _PROTEIN_ mutants . additionally vertically grown _PROTEIN_ roots appear to accumulate a greater amount of auxin in an expanded domain of the root cap compared with the wild type and no detectable _PROTEIN_ auxin gradient develops across mutant root caps in response to gravistimulation . we also demonstrate that _PROTEIN_ is a peripheral _LOCATION_ protein that may share some subcellular compartments in the vesicular trafficking pathway with _PROTEIN_ auxin efflux carriers . these data support our hypothesis that _PROTEIN_ is involved early in gravitropic signal transduction within the gravity perceiving cells where it influences ph changes and auxin distribution . we propose that _PROTEIN_ affects the localization and/or activity of _PROTEIN_ or other proteins involved in _PROTEIN_ auxin transport .
previous studies suggested that _PROTEIN_ might function in gravity signal transduction . this hypothesis predicts that _PROTEIN_ would be required in the statocytes of hypocotyls and roots to mediate a wild type gravitropic response . thus we sought to _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in the root and shoot statocytes of _PROTEIN_ null mutant seedlings . to achieve this goal we placed the _PROTEIN_ open reading frame under the control of either the _PROTEIN_ or the _PROTEIN_ promoter _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ promoter directs gene _PROTEIN_ specifically in the root cap whereas the _PROTEIN_ promoter is active only in the endodermis of both shoots and roots . when transformed into _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ construct was able to restore a wild type gravitropic response to mutant roots . in hypocotyls this construct allowed only partial rescue of the _PROTEIN_ gravitropic phenotype . conversely pscr _PROTEIN_ was able to restore a wild type gravitropic response to mutant hypocotyls but not to roots . these observations especially the rescue of mutant hypocotyls by pscr _PROTEIN_ suggest that the primary function of _PROTEIN_ in gravitropism lies in events that occur specifically within the statocytes . this conclusion is consistent with the hypothesis that _PROTEIN_ may be involved in the signal transduction phase of gravitropism . early physiological events associated with gravitropic signal transduction have been best described in root statocytes . therefore we focused our investigations of _PROTEIN_ function on its role in root gravitropism . one of the first manifestations of gravity signal transduction in roots is the alkalinization of their statocytes . using the ph sensitive bis _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ dextran reporter we analyzed this process in _PROTEIN_ and compared the response to that of wild type plants . in vertically grown plants the columella cells of _PROTEIN_ and wild type plants showed similar stable cytoplasmic ph levels of between and . upon gravistimulation wild type cells exhibited a transient increase in their cytoplasmic ph which was not found in _PROTEIN_ cells . this wild type transient ph increase in response to gravistimulation in the wassilewskija ecotype is similar to that reported previously for columella cells in the columbia ecotype . similarly the lack of a ph increase in _PROTEIN_ is reminiscent of the reduced ph changes seen in pgm root caps which lack starch and show a severe impairment in gravity perception . these observations suggest that _PROTEIN_ disrupts a cellular event that contributes to the gravity induced ph increase . we investigated the pattern of auxin dynamics in _PROTEIN_ seedlings by analyzing the activity of the auxin responsive promoter . _PROTEIN_ plants harboring a _PROTEIN_ reporter gene construct were generated from a cross between _PROTEIN_ and a columbia plant carrying this construct . plants homozygous for both _PROTEIN_ and the gus insertion or for both _PROTEIN_ and the gus insertion were identified among the progeny . thus the gus insertion is present at the same locus in both the wild type and mutant backgrounds . in the wild type background derived from either the parental gus line or the segregants gus activity was maximal in the central columella cells of the root cap . the flanking columella cells stained only faintly . in _PROTEIN_ root tips both central and flanking columella cells stained faster and more intensely for gus activity than in the wild type background . these observations suggest that _PROTEIN_ seedlings accumulate a higher level of auxin in an expanded domain of the root tip compared with wild type seedlings . upon gravistimulation the activity of the promoter expanded toward the bottom flank of the root cap in wild type seedlings . more intense gus staining was seen in peripheral columella cells on the bottom flank compared with the top flank . in the _PROTEIN_ background this asymmetry was not observed . gus _PROTEIN_ was not observed in the ez cells of the transformed roots . however when gravistimulated in the presence of naphthaleneacetic acid an auxin wild type roots exhibited greater activity at the bottom flank of the distal ez as reported previously . this gradient of activity also was observed across the distal ez of _PROTEIN_ roots suggesting that this region of _PROTEIN_ was capable of displaying a _PROTEIN_ gradient of auxin concentration or responsiveness upon gravistimulation . interestingly even in the presence of naa the gravity induced auxin gradient was not observed in _PROTEIN_ root caps . to examine the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ we generated the green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and cmyc _PROTEIN_ constructs which carry n terminal _METHOD_ or cmyc tagged _PROTEIN_ respectively . these constructs contained genomic sequences that included a kb sequence upstream of the _PROTEIN_ initiation codon the _PROTEIN_ transcribed region and a kb downstream sequence . both constructs retained the full coding sequence of _PROTEIN_ and were transformed into _PROTEIN_ . we assayed for the ability of these constructs to restore a wild type gravitropic response to _PROTEIN_ seedlings . figures and show that roots and hypocotyls of _PROTEIN_ carrying either construct exhibited gravitropism kinetics similar to that of the wild type . on the other hand nontransgenic _PROTEIN_ seedlings showed the expected alteration in their kinetics of root and hypocotyl reorientation compared with wild type seedlings . thus both constructs appeared functional and therefore should yield a fair representation of _PROTEIN_ localization . analyses of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ pattern were performed on homozygous plants and subsequent generations . confocal and multiphoton microscopy were used to analyze the localization of _PROTEIN_ in live samples of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ transgenic roots . _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was highest in the root tip region which includes the root cap the meristematic region and the elongation zones . a lower level of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ also was observed in the mature part of the root which is consistent with previous findings of ubiquitous _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . in cells of the root tip we observed a diffuse and reticulated pattern of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ compatible with _PROTEIN_ association with the _LOCATION_ . in columella root meristematic and distal ez cells we also observed punctated signals . the largest _METHOD_ dots were circular oval or linear in shape suggesting that they might correspond to _LOCATION_ stacks . other _METHOD_ dots were smaller and likely correspond to vesicles . in cortical cells the majority of these structures were localized to the subcortical region close to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ although some were found in transvacuolar strands . a c terminal _METHOD_ fusion of _PROTEIN_ showed a similar localization pattern . _METHOD_ analyses of transgenic seedlings carrying the cmyc _PROTEIN_ construct revealed a similar localization pattern but the signals were more diffuse possibly as a consequence of the fixation step needed in this assay . to investigate the association of _PROTEIN_ with the vesicle trafficking pathway we treated these seedlings before fixation with brefeldin a a compound shown to disrupt vesicle trafficking . the cmyc _PROTEIN_ fusion protein became associated with distinct bfa induced compartments . these structures were comparable to compartments in which specific proteins from the trans _LOCATION_ network the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and cell walls accumulate in response to bfa . in a double _METHOD_ labeling experiment _PROTEIN_ a transmembrane component of the auxin efflux machinery accumulated in the same subcellular compartments as cmyc _PROTEIN_ upon bfa treatment . normally _PROTEIN_ resides at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ of the epidermal and cortical cells of the distal ez _METHOD_ . the effect of bfa on the localization of both cmyc _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ was reversible . both proteins assumed their normal localization if the bfa pretreatment was followed by a h wash in bfa free medium . together these observations indicate that _PROTEIN_ likely resides in cellular compartments that participate in vesicular trafficking . this trafficking pathway may be the same pathway that is used by _PROTEIN_ in distal ez cells . _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and cmyc _PROTEIN_ fusion proteins also were found to be associated with the cell plate as indicated by double _METHOD_ staining of cmyc _PROTEIN_ and tubulin . accordingly treatment of transgenic seedlings with oryzalin a microtubule destabilizing compound resulted in _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ localization at aberrant cell division planes . topred a protein topology prediction program predicted a single pass transmembrane region between the j domain and the predicted coiled coil region of _PROTEIN_ . however this region also is rich in gly and phe suggesting that it might instead act as a linker between the j domain and the c terminus similar to the gly/phe rich region of many dnaj like proteins . furthermore no signal peptides or potential post translational _LOCATION_ association motifs could be identified in _PROTEIN_ by sequence analysis . because _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ appeared to localize to the _LOCATION_ the _LOCATION_ and vesicles near the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ we took a biochemical approach to investigate _PROTEIN_ 's association with plant _LOCATION_ . we prepared microsomal _LOCATION_ and soluble protein fractions from liquid cultures of cmyc _PROTEIN_ transgenic plants because the localization pattern of _PROTEIN_ was preserved among different root tissues . immunoblot analyses with anti cmyc antibodies indicated that cmyc _PROTEIN_ was associated primarily with the microsomes and was barely detectable in the soluble fraction . this association was sensitive to the presence of a denaturing agent and to a high ph environment . the sensitivity of _PROTEIN_ 's _LOCATION_ association with these compounds strongly suggests that _PROTEIN_ associates peripherally with plant _LOCATION_ and indicates that it is not an integral _LOCATION_ protein . the association of _PROTEIN_ with the microsomes was not affected by changes in the redox potential of its environment nor was it modified by a change in ionic interactions . however it was sensitive to the presence of triton x indicating that it interacts directly or indirectly with integral _LOCATION_ proteins . yet a small portion of _PROTEIN_ remained in the pellet even when _PROTEIN_ an integral _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ protein was solubilized almost completely by triton x . this fraction of _PROTEIN_ could have been retained in the pellet by means of its interaction with the _LOCATION_ which is resistant to triton x extraction . sequence analyses of _PROTEIN_ also revealed the similarity of its predicted coiled coil region to the coiled coil of _LOCATION_ interacting proteins such as incenp . to further investigate the possible _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ association we analyzed the fractionation of cmyc _PROTEIN_ after a round of _LOCATION_ depolymerization and repolymerization . the _LOCATION_ was depolymerized partially by treatment of the _LOCATION_ enriched microsomal pellets with m ki . a large portion of _PROTEIN_ was released from the pellet by this treatment . upon the removal of ki through dialysis actin subunits repolymerized and were collected in the pellet . immunoblot analyses revealed that some _PROTEIN_ protein was associated with the same pellet although some remained in the supernatant . this observation suggested that a small pool of _PROTEIN_ might be associated with the _LOCATION_ . unfortunately the low abundance of _PROTEIN_ in this pool precluded a more thorough analysis of such interactions . thus the association of _PROTEIN_ with microsomal _LOCATION_ likely is mediated through its interaction with other _LOCATION_ associated proteins and possibly partly through its direct or indirect interaction with the _LOCATION_ . we attempted to identify the types of _LOCATION_ that _PROTEIN_ is associated with . _LOCATION_ free total protein extracts from week old etiolated cmyc _PROTEIN_ transgenic plants were fractionated on a continuous to sucrose gradient . cmyc _PROTEIN_ was found to fractionate in a range of the gradient at which markers from the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ and other _LOCATION_ including the _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ and the _LOCATION_ can be found . the pattern of cmyc _PROTEIN_ fractionation also overlapped partially with that of an endosomal marker _PROTEIN_ . this observation is consistent with _PROTEIN_ 's association with cellular compartments involved in _LOCATION_ trafficking and with the cell plates . because _PROTEIN_ likely was associated with multiple _LOCATION_ we sought to determine its relative distribution in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ versus other _LOCATION_ . the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ was fractionated from the microsomal _LOCATION_ using a two phase partitioning method . immunoblot analyses showed that the pm h _PROTEIN_ control was enriched in the upper phase _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ fraction and almost absent from the lower phase which contains the majority of other _LOCATION_ . on the other hand most of the _PROTEIN_ was retained in the lower phase indicating that the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ fraction was relatively pure . cmyc _PROTEIN_ was found in both fractions although there appeared to be less _PROTEIN_ per milligram of protein in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ fraction than in the other fraction in agreement with our _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ _METHOD_ data and with the sucrose gradient experiment . surprisingly the mobility of cmyc _PROTEIN_ was altered in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ fraction . this mobility shift probably is an electrophoresis artifact possibly resulting from the high polyethylene glycol content within that phase . indeed when a more sensitive detection method was used some _PROTEIN_ also was found in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ fraction and its mobility was shifted similarly to cmyc _PROTEIN_ .
