following the endosymbiotic acquisition of mitochondria by eukaryotic cells most of the genes in this organelle were transferred to the _LOCATION_ . to _PROTEIN_ mitochondrial biogenesis and function _LOCATION_ and mitochondrial genomes require regulated and coordinated _PROTEIN_ . in plant organelles _LOCATION_ encoded proteins targeted to the organelles control posttranscriptional and posttranslational _METHOD_ . pentatricopeptide repeat _PROTEIN_ proteins are good candidates to play such regulatory roles . here we identify _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ a novel _PROTEIN_ protein that is dual localized to mitochondria and _LOCATION_ in arabidopsis thaliana as observed by green _METHOD_ protein fusions and immunodetection on subcellular fractions and on histological sections . genetic complementation showed that loss of _PROTEIN_ function in mitochondria but not in _LOCATION_ is lethal for the embryo . in mitochondria it is associated with polysomes and may play a role in translation . a genetic screen in yeast identified protein partners of _PROTEIN_ . these partners the nucleosome assembly protein _PROTEIN_ and the transcription _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ interact with _PROTEIN_ in the _LOCATION_ in planta . furthermore _PROTEIN_ can bind the promoter of _PROTEIN_ . this suggests that _PROTEIN_ might be involved in the regulation of its own gene _PROTEIN_ in the _LOCATION_ and could thus play a role in gene _PROTEIN_ adjustments between mitochondria and the _LOCATION_ .
to gain insights into the involvement of _PROTEIN_ proteins in mitochondrial translation as suggested by the interaction of _PROTEIN_ with mitochondrial polysomes we initially performed a reverse genetic screen of arabidopsis mutants representing _PROTEIN_ genes of unknown function . the collections from the syngenta arabidopsis insertion library and salk institute were screened to look for t dna insertions in arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ genes . we were unable to find any homozygous plants for two independent t dna insertion alleles for _GENE_ when we looked at progeny of a large number of heterozygous plants . we named this gene _PROTEIN_ for _PROTEIN_ protein localized to the _LOCATION_ and mitochondria . the dissection of siliques from heterozygous mutant plants showed that about one quarter of the embryos are aborted indicating that homozygous mutation of _PROTEIN_ is lethal at an early stage of embryo development and thus that _PROTEIN_ has an essential function . the availability of numerous est sequences _METHOD_ that _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ transcript end was characterized by rapid amplification of cdna ends . transcript ends were exclusively located in a region between and nucleotides upstream of the _PROTEIN_ initiation codon . it suggests that the _PROTEIN_ transcript has neither alternative transcription start sites nor alternative splicing . to investigate the _PROTEIN_ pattern of _PROTEIN_ in different tissues we used a promoter _PROTEIN_ reporter system . the sequence between the start codon of _PROTEIN_ and the stop codon of the upstream gene was used to drive the gus reporter gene _PROTEIN_ and stably introduced in arabidopsis by agroinfection . in five independent _PROTEIN_ gus plant lines gus activity was visible in root tips _PROTEIN_ root primordial and leaf primordia . in addition a high level of gus activity was detected in the mature pollen grains . these data indicate that _PROTEIN_ is mostly _PROTEIN_ in pollen grains and in actively dividing cells during vegetative growth . _GENE_ encodes a putative protein of amino acids with an estimated molecular _METHOD_ of kd . sequence analysis revealed that the protein harbors seven _PROTEIN_ motifs and two predicted localization signals a mitochondrial target signal at its n terminus and a putative _LOCATION_ localization signal rich in basic residues at its c terminus . alignment of _PROTEIN_ with orthologs from numerous plant species shows that this basic region is highly conserved and thus might be functional . the presence of the two predicted localization signals suggested that _PROTEIN_ could be dual targeted to mitochondria and _LOCATION_ and led us to investigate the precise distribution of _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis cells . to analyze the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ in plant cells we first transiently _PROTEIN_ in tobacco cells different green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ tagged proteins under the control of a promoter . the c terminal translational fusion of the full length _PROTEIN_ with _METHOD_ _METHOD_ localizes to mitochondria of tobacco cells . the n terminal fusion of _METHOD_ to _PROTEIN_ prevents its import into mitochondria and the _METHOD_ protein shows a _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ localization . deletion of the mitochondrial target signal _METHOD_ restricts the localization of the protein to the _LOCATION_ . these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ harbors a signal that can target the protein to the _LOCATION_ . to verify that this _LOCATION_ targeting property is indeed encoded by the c terminal putative nls signal the last bp of _PROTEIN_ were fused in frame with gus gene _METHOD_ encoding the _LOCATION_ gus protein . the _METHOD_ protein was localized exclusively to the _LOCATION_ . this shows that the putative nls signal is active in plant cells . to confirm the mitochondrial and _LOCATION_ localizations of _PROTEIN_ in vivo immunodetection was performed on arabidopsis subcellular fractions using polyclonal antibodies generated against the full length _PROTEIN_ . the antibodies detected a unique kd protein in the mitochondrial and _LOCATION_ fractions . the purity of the respective subcellular fractions was demonstrated with antibodies specific to each subcellular fraction . to determine to which form of _PROTEIN_ the kd signals correspond the full length and the predicted mature form of _PROTEIN_ were _PROTEIN_ and purified and their sizes compared with the signals detected . this analysis revealed that the signals correspond to the mature form of _PROTEIN_ . localization was further investigated by immunohistochemistry . _PROTEIN_ antibodies were used to detect the protein in histochemical sections from arabidopsis seedlings . signal was observed in structures that correspond to _LOCATION_ as indicated by the colocalization with diamidino phenylindole staining . signal specificity was confirmed by comparing the _PROTEIN_ primary antibody with its preimmune serum . localization was also investigated by immunogold labeling with _PROTEIN_ specific antibodies and electron microscopy . this showed that _PROTEIN_ can be localized in mitochondria and the _LOCATION_ within the same cell . altogether the results show that _PROTEIN_ is a novel dual localized _PROTEIN_ protein in arabidopsis cells . the dual localization of _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis cells reveals that the protein likely plays an essential role in either mitochondria or the _LOCATION_ or in both organelles . to determine which localization is essential for embryogenesis heterozygous _PROTEIN_ mutant plants were complemented with constructs driven by the endogenous _PROTEIN_ promoter and _PROTEIN_ either the wild type _PROTEIN_ gene or truncated versions deleted of either the mitochondrial targeting signal or the nls . the self progeny of three independent transgenic and heterozygous _PROTEIN_ plants for each construct were analyzed by genotyping . the wild type transgene successfully complemented the _PROTEIN_ mutation indicating that the embryo lethal phenotype was indeed caused by the loss of function of _GENE_ . by contrast the truncated gene lacking a mts did not complement the _PROTEIN_ mutation . finally the version deleted of the c terminal part of the _PROTEIN_ gene complemented the _PROTEIN_ mutation and resulted in viable plants . these results indicate that _PROTEIN_ has an essential function in mitochondria and a distinct although nonessential role in the _LOCATION_ of plant cells . _PROTEIN_ proteins were predicted to be rna binding proteins and studies have already shown that some _PROTEIN_ proteins can indeed directly bind rna . here we used biacore technology based on surface plasmon resonance to establish whether _PROTEIN_ was also able to bind rna or not . recombinant _PROTEIN_ was captured on sensor _PROTEIN_ and rna solutions were used as potential ligands . high affinity binding was observed when arabidopsis total mitochondrial rna was used but not with total _LOCATION_ rna . the release of rna from _PROTEIN_ was slow which suggests that the interaction with rna is stable rather than transient . mitochondrial rna were fractionated by licl precipitation and used for interaction assays . interaction was observed with mitochondrial rna from the licl pellet containing mrna as well as and rrnas and not with the licl supernatant which contains trnas and rrna . kinetic analyses were performed through consecutive injections of increasing concentrations of rna . this enabled to determine that _PROTEIN_ is able to bind rna with a kd in the nanomolar range . when oligoribonucleotides representing poly a c g and u were used _PROTEIN_ was able to bind poly g with high affinity as already observed for other _PROTEIN_ proteins but not the other oligoribonucleotides . thioredoxin or tobacco mosaic virus protein was used as a negative control to show that the affinity response observed was indeed due to rna/protein interaction and not to artifactual binding of rna to sensor _PROTEIN_ . altogether the results indicate that _PROTEIN_ is able to bind rna . _PROTEIN_ plays an essential function in arabidopsis mitochondria . its capacity to bind rna suggests that its function could be related to an essential posttranscriptional process in mitochondria as observed for a rapidly growing number of _PROTEIN_ proteins in plant organelles . we first investigated the submitochondrial localization of _PROTEIN_ . it was detected in mitoplasts _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ and in soluble and extrinsic _LOCATION_ protein fractions . these results indicate that _PROTEIN_ is a soluble protein in the mitochondrial _PROTEIN_ and a peripheral protein of the inner _LOCATION_ as well . subsequently the association of _PROTEIN_ with complexes containing rna in mitochondria was investigated through the immunodetection of _PROTEIN_ in complexes separated by sucrose density gradients . fractions representing the entire gradients were collected . equivalent amounts of proteins from each fraction were reacted with _PROTEIN_ antibodies . the kd signal was detected for fractions at the bottom of the gradients . fractions were also reacted with antibodies specific for the ribosomal protein _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ from respiratory complex i. _PROTEIN_ was only detected in the top fractions of the gradients suggesting that they contain complexes of sizes up to kd . on the other hand _PROTEIN_ was detected in the same bottom fractions of the gradient as _PROTEIN_ . these bottom fractions were proposed to contain polysomes . this suggested that _PROTEIN_ could be associated with polysomes . mitochondrial samples were subjected to treatments leading to the destabilization of polysomes to demonstrate this assumption . samples were treated with puromycin which specifically destabilizes ribosomes and with rnase which results in the degradation of rna necessary to _PROTEIN_ polysome integrity . in all cases after treatment and separation on gradients _PROTEIN_ similar to _PROTEIN_ was no longer detected in bottom fractions . this _METHOD_ that _PROTEIN_ is indeed associated with polysomes in an rna dependent manner in arabidopsis mitochondria which is consistent with the capacity of _PROTEIN_ to bind rna although the precise nature of this association with polysomes is unknown . to identify the precise rna targets of _PROTEIN_ in mitochondria extensive efforts were deployed to coimmunoprecipitate _PROTEIN_ in its native form bound to rna partners from a solubilized arabidopsis mitochondrial extract with either anti _PROTEIN_ serum or purified anti _PROTEIN_ polyclonal antibodies as described previously . surprisingly we were unable to immunoprecipitate _PROTEIN_ presumably because the epitopes recognized by the antibodies in denaturing conditions are hidden when the protein is in its native form . the identification of protein partners should give clues to understanding the function of _PROTEIN_ . for this a screen using a system derived from yeast two hybrid was performed . the dual hunter system _METHOD_ enables the use of a _LOCATION_ protein as bait . briefly a bait protein of interest is inserted in frame with the _LOCATION_ protein the c terminal half of ubiquitin and the transcription _PROTEIN_ lexa . a second protein of interest is fused at the c terminus of a mutated version of the n terminal domain of ubiquitin . if bait and prey interact cub and nubg complement to form split ubiquitin . then ubiquitin specific proteases release lexa which migrates to the _LOCATION_ and activates the transcription of reporter genes . we screened an arabidopsis seedling cdna library for proteins that interact with _PROTEIN_ . of transformants screened positive clones were identified . eight different cdna clones contained sequences of _GENE_ encoding _PROTEIN_ the nucleosome assembly protein . the cdnas rescued from the three other clones represented a _LOCATION_ transcriptional _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and two proteins of unknown functions _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ belongs to the tcp transcription _PROTEIN_ family known to bind site ii elements in promoter regions . _PROTEIN_ contains a ubiquitin fold modifier specific peptidase domain suggesting that the protein could interact with the ubiquitin protein fused to _PROTEIN_ rather than with _PROTEIN_ itself . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ do not contain any predictable localization or function in mitochondria and/or the _LOCATION_ and were thus not further investigated at this stage . the full length mature _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ cdna sequences were subsequently cloned in the respective dual hunter vectors to confirm protein interactions . the results showed that _PROTEIN_ is indeed able to interact directly with both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ two proteins involved in gene _PROTEIN_ and localized in plant _LOCATION_ . the protein interactions observed in yeast were investigated in planta . for this we used the bimolecular _METHOD_ complementation approach . this method relies on _PROTEIN_ of the two proteins of interest as translational fusions either to the nonfluorescing n terminal or c terminal halves of yellow _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ . only when the _METHOD_ halves are brought together by interaction of the fused proteins can they form a functional _METHOD_ fluorophore which can be detected with an _METHOD_ microscope . a set of vectors was generated to _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ fused with the n terminal or the c terminal part of the _METHOD_ after transient transformation of onion epidermal cells using particle bombardment . _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was observed in the _LOCATION_ of plant cells when the vectors encoding _PROTEIN_ were cobombarded in combination with the vectors _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ respectively . these results show that _PROTEIN_ interacts physically with _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in the _LOCATION_ of living plant cells . to get insights into the function of _PROTEIN_ in plant _LOCATION_ we analyzed both macroscopic and molecular phenotypes of complemented _PROTEIN_ plants . three independent complementation lines were analyzed for both heterozygous _PROTEIN_ and homozygous _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ proteins levels were first checked in both mitochondria and the _LOCATION_ . _PROTEIN_ levels were unchanged in the heterozygous _PROTEIN_ lines whereas it was absent from the _LOCATION_ in _PROTEIN_ plants . when grown on half strength murashige and skoog medium _PROTEIN_ plants showed a delay in root elongation . plants from the three lines had shorter roots after d on average . because _PROTEIN_ interacts with _PROTEIN_ in plant _LOCATION_ and because the _PROTEIN_ gene has site ii elements _PROTEIN_ in its promoter region we investigated transcript levels of _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ plants . a kb transcript was detected in wild type plants whereas a slightly smaller rna which corresponds to _PROTEIN_ sequence lacking the nucleotides of the nls region was detected in mutants . in addition _PROTEIN_ transcript levels were on average higher in _PROTEIN_ compared with the wild type for the three independent mutant lines analyzed . to verify that transcript level variations were indeed due to the absence of _PROTEIN_ from plant _LOCATION_ we also looked at rna levels of exemplary chosen _LOCATION_ genes also containing site ii elements in their promoter sequence _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ that all encode proteins of the mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation machinery . similar to _PROTEIN_ transcript levels for these genes were on average higher in mutants . these gene _PROTEIN_ variations were statistically significant . by contrast when genes that do not contain site ii elements in their promoter region were used _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ unchanged _PROTEIN_ levels were observed in the mutant lines . the interaction of _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ and the transcript level upregulation for genes such as _PROTEIN_ containing site ii elements in their promoter region in _PROTEIN_ mutants led us to investigate whether _PROTEIN_ could directly bind the _PROTEIN_ promoter . this was analyzed by electromobility shift assays with recombinant _PROTEIN_ and double stranded dna probes representing two regions in _PROTEIN_ promoter . two shifted bands were observed with _PROTEIN_ and the sii probe . when _PROTEIN_ was added no additional shifted band was observed but the relative amount of band increased . however no shift was observed between _PROTEIN_ alone and the sii probe . no shift was observed with the pr probe and no interaction was observed between single stranded dna probes and _PROTEIN_ . the two shifted bands could be due to the presence of two site ii elements in the sii probe . alternatively the two bands could reflect the association of either monomers or dimers of _PROTEIN_ to the probe . indeed tcp proteins were already shown to be able to dimerize . in this case the addition of _PROTEIN_ to the binding reaction might have resulted in a competition with _PROTEIN_ for dimer formation . altogether these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ can specifically bind site ii elements in the promoter region of _PROTEIN_ .
