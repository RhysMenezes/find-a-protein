nad is a ubiquitous coenzyme involved in oxidation reduction reactions and is synthesized by way of quinolinate . animals and some bacteria synthesize quinolinate from tryptophan whereas other bacteria synthesize quinolinate from aspartate using l asp oxidase and quinolinate synthase . we show here that arabidopsis uses the asp to quinolinate pathway . the arabidopsis l asp oxidase or quinolinate synthase gene complemented the escherichia coli mutant defective in the corresponding gene and t dna based disruption of either of these genes as well as of the gene coding for the enzyme quinolinate phosphoribosyltransferase was embryo lethal . an analysis of functional green _METHOD_ protein fused constructs and in vitro assays of uptake into isolated chloroplasts demonstrated that these three enzymes are located in the _LOCATION_ .
computer searches of the arabidopsis genome database revealed that the protein encoded by _GENE_ is significantly homologous to e. coli _PROTEIN_ whereas the protein encoded by _GENE_ is a homolog of e. coli _PROTEIN_ . in contrast no significant homology with the enzymes in the kynurenine pathway was found one exception being the protein encoded by _GENE_ which was moderately homologous to mouse arylformamidase . to test whether _GENE_ and _GENE_ respectively encode _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ these arabidopsis genes were introduced and _PROTEIN_ in e. coli mutants deficient in _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ . because the e. coli strains and do not _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ respectively and can not synthesize nad via the de novo pathway they require a supplement of nicotinic acid in minimal medium to synthesize nad via the salvage pathway . when _GENE_ was _PROTEIN_ in the genotype e. coli cells were able to form colonies on minimal medium lacking nicotinic acid . likewise _PROTEIN_ of _GENE_ in the genotype also complemented the requirement of an exogenous source of nicotinic acid for growth . these results suggest that _GENE_ and _GENE_ indeed encode _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ respectively . if arabidopsis synthesizes nad de novo exclusively from asp null alleles of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ should be lethal . to test this hypothesis we analyzed phenotypes of t dna insertion alleles of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ which are both single genes in the arabidopsis genome . we also characterized a transposon insertion allele of _PROTEIN_ a presumably essential gene utilized in both the asp and kynurenine pathways . tobacco _PROTEIN_ has been shown to complement a _PROTEIN_ deficient e. coli strain and arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ is encoded at a single locus . in the ao allele obtained from the salk collection an inverted tandem insert of t dna was found in the seventh exon of _PROTEIN_ to bp downstream of the translational start site _PROTEIN_ whereas inverted t dnas were inserted in the first exon of _PROTEIN_ between and bp in the qs allele . the qpt allele obtained from the cold spring harbor laboratory collection contained a dissociation transposon in the third exon of _PROTEIN_ bp from the translational start site . the nucleotides between and bp were duplicated at the insertion site . we could not identify lines with a homozygous disruption for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ among the seeds obtained from the stock center . when plants heterozygous for the t dna or transposon insertion were self pollinated we found wild type and heterozygous plants at a ratio but no homozygous plants in the next generation . these segregation data are consistent with the hypothesis that homozygous null alleles for the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ genes do not grow into viable seedlings . indeed when immature siliques of the self pollinated heterozygous plants were cut open roughly of the seeds they contained were found to be small and unviable . genetic analysis of ao qs and qpt mutants values were calculated based on a ratio of heterozygous and wild type plants . to confirm that the observed embryo lethal phenotypes are caused by disruption of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ we transformed the heterozygous plants with a vector that constitutively _PROTEIN_ the wild type _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ protein fused to green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ at the c terminus . among the progeny of the transformants we identified several plants that were homozygous for the t dna or transposon insertion alleles of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and possessed the relevant transgenes . _PROTEIN_ of the transgenes was confirmed by detection of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ in the transgenic plants . the newly introduced transgenes efficiently complemented the presumed embryo lethal phenotypes of the homozygous null alleles as shown by the similar growth and development of the complemented plants compared with the wild type . arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ contain extra amino acid sequences at their n termini relative to their e. coli counterparts . the computer _METHOD_ predotar and targetp respectively predicted that arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are targeted to _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ whereas arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ is localized to mitochondoria . to determine experimentally the subcellular distribution of these arabidopsis proteins we first analyzed transgenic arabidopsis seedlings _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in the respective homozygous null backgrounds as described above . complementation of the embryo lethal phenotypes by _PROTEIN_ of the transgenes suggests that these _METHOD_ fused proteins are active enzymes targeted to their proper subcellular locations . _METHOD_ microscopic observation of stomata guard cells in stable arabidopsis transformants confirmed that nonfused _METHOD_ was present in the cytoplasm and the _LOCATION_ whereas _METHOD_ fused to the transit peptide of the small subunit of rubisco at the n terminus _METHOD_ was targeted to the chloroplast . we found that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ are all distributed to the chloroplast . in the root tissue _METHOD_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was observed in small oblique organelles that resembled undifferentiated _LOCATION_ . we next conducted an in vitro uptake assay using isolated chloroplasts . full length _METHOD_ of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were synthesized with an in vitro transcription translation system using reticulocyte lysates and then incubated with purified chloroplasts from pea seedlings . intact chloroplasts were recovered after the reaction and were found to contain the imported substrates that had been processed into smaller polypeptides . these processed proteins corresponded to _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ upon cleavage of the predicted transit peptides .
escherichia coli strains have disruptions in the nadb gene encoding _PROTEIN_ and in the nada gene encoding _PROTEIN_ respectively and were used for the complementation assay . the entire open reading frames of arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ and arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ were amplified from the institute of physical and chemical research cdna clones and respectively by pcr using the primer pair ggttccatggcggctcatgtttctactggaaac and ggccctcgagtgcaatcaataagtgagctgcta for _PROTEIN_ and ttaaccatggcgttagctctctccgtcgcacct and ggccctcgagttctcttgctctcacaacttaat for _PROTEIN_ . the forward primers contained ncoi sites whereas the reverse primers contained xhoi sites . the pcr products were cloned into the vector pgem t excised as ncoi xhoi fragments and cloned into the _PROTEIN_ vector ptrchis . the resultant plasmids ptrchis _PROTEIN_ and ptrchis atqs were introduced into the e. coli mutant strains genetic stock center nos . and respectively which were then grown on minimal medium containing ampicillin and mm isopropylthio d galactoside with or without nicotinic acid . t dna insertion lines of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were generated at the salk institute genomic analysis laboratory and obtained from the arabidopsis biological resource centre . a transposon insertion line of _PROTEIN_ was obtained from the cold spring harbor laboratory . t dna insertion sites were analyzed by pcr and then by sequencing the t dna genome junctions using as primers cccatcaaactacaaactgcta and caaataagaacaaaaactcctg for _PROTEIN_ aacagaaatcaaacaacaaatc and gacccctaacccttctcctaat for _PROTEIN_ and gcgtggaccgcttgctgcaact for the left border sequence of t dna . the transposon insertion site in _PROTEIN_ was analyzed after amplifying the transposon genome junction regions using as primers tagctgaagatgctggtcatacagg and tgccattaactgcaggaaacagac for _PROTEIN_ and acccgaccggatcgtatcggt and gaaacggtcgggaaactagctctac for transposon terminal sequences . arabidopsis seedlings were grown on murashige and skoog salt agar plates without antibiotics at under a h h dark cycle and were analyzed for the presence of the t dna or transposon insertions by genomic pcr using the above primers . the coding regions lacking the stop codons were amplified from the arabidopsis cdna clones of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ using as primers aaaaagcaggctcgcgagctttaaggtcggaaa and _PROTEIN_ for _PROTEIN_ aaaaagcaggctcgactgcttccaatggcgttag and _PROTEIN_ for _PROTEIN_ and aaaaagcaggctcgacaatgatctctgtctctc and _PROTEIN_ for _PROTEIN_ and cloned into the gateway binary vector by way of the entry vector . the transgene in is _PROTEIN_ as a c terminal _METHOD_ fused protein under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus promoter and the nopaline synthase terminator . the constructs were introduced into the arabidopsis lines hemizygous for the t dna and transposon insertion at the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ locus using the agrobacterium mediated infiltration method . an arabidopsis _LOCATION_ marker line that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fused to the _LOCATION_ transit peptide of the small subunit of rubisco was provided by y. niwa . the presence of _METHOD_ fusion transgenes in the arabidopsis genome was confirmed by pcr using the primer pair tcctacaacagctagttgga and cggccatgatatagacgttg for _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ tgtcgggtgtgagccgatac and tgtgatcgcgcttctcgttg for _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and gaggtgggaagaaggaccaa and ggcggacttgaagaagtcgt for _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . thin sections of the leaf epidermal cell layer were prepared by manually cutting cotyledons and leaves with sharp razor blades and guard cells of the stomata were examined . _METHOD_ fused proteins and chlorophyll _METHOD_ were detected by employing an eclipse _METHOD_ microscope . _METHOD_ was excited at to nm and detected between to nm whereas chlorophyll _METHOD_ was excited at to nm and detected at above nm . pictures were taken with a digital camera . import competent chloroplasts were isolated and purified from pea seedlings as described previously . isolated chloroplasts were suspended in an import buffer to a chlorophyll concentration of mg/ml . the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ genes in were subcloned into the vector pet and were used as templates for in vitro transcription/translation with a tnt coupled reticulocyte lysate system in the presence of l met . a chloroplast suspension of was mixed with mm na _PROTEIN_ mm na _PROTEIN_ and mm in of the import buffer and then of labeled proteins were added . the reaction mixture was incubated in the dark at room temperature for min and then loaded onto of a percoll cushion in the import buffer . intact chloroplasts were isolated by centrifugation . the chloroplasts in the pellet were suspended in the import buffer and recovered by centrifugation . the purified chloroplasts were suspended in the sample buffer of the laemmli system . samples were separated by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and analyzed with an image analyzer _PROTEIN_ .
