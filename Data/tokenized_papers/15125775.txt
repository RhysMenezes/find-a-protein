leaf shape is determined by _PROTEIN_ cell expansion and _PROTEIN_ cell proliferation along the leaf axes . however the genes controlling _PROTEIN_ cell proliferation during leaf morphogenesis are largely unknown . we identified a dominant mutant of arabidopsis thaliana _PROTEIN_ which possessed short leaves and floral organs . we showed that the altered leaf shape is caused by reduced cell proliferation specifically in the longitudinal axis of the leaf suggesting that the _PROTEIN_ gene controls _PROTEIN_ cell proliferation in _PROTEIN_ organs . the _PROTEIN_ open reading frame encodes a novel small peptide that had not been identified in the arabidopsis genome annotation . overexpression of a _PROTEIN_ green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ fusion protein in transgenic plants recapitulated the _PROTEIN_ phenotype suggesting that _PROTEIN_ acts to restrict cell proliferation . the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein localized to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ when _PROTEIN_ in transgenic arabidopsis plants . phylogenetic analysis indicates that _PROTEIN_ defines a novel seed plant specific family of small peptides with members in arabidopsis rot four _PROTEIN_ . all rtfl members share a conserved amino acid domain the rtf domain and overexpression of the _PROTEIN_ rtf domain alone is sufficient to confer a _PROTEIN_ phenotype . loss of function mutations in several rtfl genes were aphenotypic suggesting that there may be some functional redundancy between family members . analyses by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and in situ hybridization revealed that _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ in the shoot apex and young leaves of wild type plants consistent with a role for _PROTEIN_ in controlling _PROTEIN_ dependent cell proliferation during wild type leaf morphogenesis .
an insertional mutagenesis was performed by transforming plants with the t dna containing plasmid . insertion of this t dna in intergenic regions frequently results in gain of function mutations that increase _PROTEIN_ of flanking genes . seeds were harvested from individual primary transformants and the resulting families were screened for mutations affecting leaf morphology . one family segregated for a novel short leaf phenotype in a ratio consistent with the presence of a single dominant mutation . because the mutagenesis was performed in a landsberg _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ background that also carried the weak curly leaf allele clf the mutation was introduced into an _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ background by crossing three times to plants of columbia ecotype . a similar dominant mutant phenotype was observed to segregate indicating that the phenotype was independent of the _LOCATION_ or _PROTEIN_ genes . the mutation was designated _PROTEIN_ and all subsequent morphological analyses involved comparison of _PROTEIN_ and wild type sibs in the introgressed columbia background . the leaf blade of _PROTEIN_ was short and rounded . the reductions in leaf blade and petiole length in _PROTEIN_ were more severe than those in leaf blade width . in addition the reduction in leaf blade length was more pronounced in leaves formed at _PROTEIN_ developmental stages . in addition to the effects on leaf blade and petiole _PROTEIN_ floral organs and inflorescence _METHOD_ were also shorter than those of wild type . by contrast there were no significant differences in morphological features between wild type and _PROTEIN_ roots . to test whether the reduced leaf length in _PROTEIN_ was because of a _PROTEIN_ in cell number or size or both the numbers and sizes of the palisade cells in the first third and fifth rosette leaves were measured . the leaf blades of _PROTEIN_ had fewer cells than that of the wild type and as in the case of the leaf blade length this was more evident in the leaves formed at _PROTEIN_ developmental stages . to relate the _PROTEIN_ in the cell number to the effect of _PROTEIN_ on leaf shape the palisade cell numbers in both the leaf length and leaf width directions were counted . again the number of palisade cells in the leaf length direction in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in a similar fashion to the _PROTEIN_ in total cell number in the subepidermal layer . however the cell numbers along the leaf width direction in _PROTEIN_ were not significantly different at any of the developmental stages examined . in addition the palisade cell sizes in bottom middle and top portions of first and third leaves in _PROTEIN_ were comparable to the corresponding wild type leaves and portions . although the cell size in the bottom portion of the fifth leaf in _PROTEIN_ was smaller than that of wild type this might be because of a retardation in fifth leaf expansion as _PROTEIN_ plants grow slightly slower than wild type . cells in older leaves of _PROTEIN_ expanded to a similar extent to wild type cells . taken together these results suggest that the _PROTEIN_ effect of the _PROTEIN_ mutation is a _PROTEIN_ in cell proliferation along the leaf length direction . the measurements of cell size and cell number do not account for the _PROTEIN_ in leaf width . this discrepancy could be attributable to the combined effect of subtle _PROTEIN_ in the cell number in the leaf width direction and cell size in _PROTEIN_ . in fifth leaves wild type and _PROTEIN_ were indistinguishable with respect to the sizes and the shapes of palisade sponge and epidermal cells when transverse sections were examined . we also characterized cells in the leaf margins as epidermal cells in the leaf margins make only longitudinal divisions in tobacco at least . as elsewhere the length of the cells did not differ significantly between wild type and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in the first set of foliage leaves _PROTEIN_ . as the length of the leaf margin is significantly _PROTEIN_ in the _PROTEIN_ mutant these data indicate that longitudinal cell division also in the margin of the leaves is severely _PROTEIN_ in the mutant . taken together cell proliferation in all regions of the leaf blade is _PROTEIN_ by the overexpression of _PROTEIN_ . southern blot analysis of the original population that segregated _PROTEIN_ indicated that a single t dna insertion was present . to test whether this insertion might cause _PROTEIN_ mutation we analyzed the genetic linkage of the mutant phenotype with a herbicide resistance marker carried on the t dna . all mutants in the original family were resistant whereas the wild type plants were herbicide sensitive consistent with the insertion being responsible for the _PROTEIN_ mutation . to identify the affected gene the dna flanking the t dna insertion was isolated by plasmid rescue . sequence analysis indicated that the insertion was in an intergenic region on chromosome ii between the genes and _GENE_ . however when the mrna levels of these genes were determined by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction _PROTEIN_ levels were similar in _PROTEIN_ and wild type plants suggesting that neither gene was likely to be responsible for the _PROTEIN_ phenotype . because the interval between these two genes was relatively long we searched the region for potential open reading frames . a tblastx search was performed using the genomic dna sequence between the stop codon of and the stop codon of _GENE_ as a query and several cdna sequences from a. thaliana and other plant species were retrieved . although none of them perfectly matched the query genomic sequence on the basis of the alignments and conceptual translations a small potential orf which encodes amino acid residues was identified . the orf was located within kbp from the right border of the t dna insert . because t dna insertions generally affect _PROTEIN_ of genes adjacent to the t dna right border which carries cauliflower mosaic virus enhancers it seemed likely that increased _PROTEIN_ of this orf was the basis of the dominant _PROTEIN_ phenotype . to test whether this small orf was _PROTEIN_ in wild type rt pcr was carried out . as shown in figure a cdna band of the expected size was amplified . in addition this mrna accumulated at a higher level in _PROTEIN_ than in wild type . because these results strongly suggested that _PROTEIN_ encodes this small orf its full length sequence was determined by rapid amplification of cdna ends _PROTEIN_ pcr . to confirm that this gene corresponded to _PROTEIN_ we tested whether the _PROTEIN_ phenotype was reconstituted when wild type plants were transformed with a construct that placed the candidate gene fused with green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ under control of the camv promoter _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . foliage leaves of homozygous plants from three independent transformants were shorter than those of wild type as was seen in _PROTEIN_ confirming that the candidate gene corresponded to _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ pattern was examined in various organs of wild type plants by rt pcr analysis using _PROTEIN_ specific primer sets . although _PROTEIN_ was strongly _PROTEIN_ in flowers and flower buds the accumulation of _PROTEIN_ mrna was not detected in mature rosette leaves . in young seedlings however the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ was clearly detected in shoots . we next characterized the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ level in shoots of seedling at different developmental stages . after stratification plants were incubated under dark condition for days and were then grown in light for several days . the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ level in shoots of seedlings was highest at days after the shift to light . using plants at this stage the organ specificity of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was analyzed . the shoots of seedlings were dissected into the fully expanded cotyledons the primordia of the first pair of foliage leaves and shoot apices which included the shoot apical meristem and younger leaf primordia . the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was highest in the shoot apices and somewhat reduced in the leaf primordia . _PROTEIN_ in the mature cotyledons was extremely low . these results confirmed that _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ in wild type leaves during early developmental stages . to localize the _PROTEIN_ transcript more precisely digoxigenin labeled probes were hybridized in situ to sections of wild type and _PROTEIN_ plants . the probes were synthesized from a short bp region of _PROTEIN_ that lacked similarity with any other sequences in the arabidopsis genome . however we were unable to detect any signal when wild type materials were probed with the _PROTEIN_ antisense probe other than a very low background signal that was also seen when a _PROTEIN_ sense probe was used as a control . as a further control we also hybridized probes for the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ gene to wild type inflorescence sections . the characteristic _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ pattern was seen confirming that the experimental sensitivity was adequate for detecting tissue specific accumulation of transcripts . the sensitivity may have been lower for _PROTEIN_ because the probe necessarily derived from a much shorter region . in the case of _PROTEIN_ the probe was synthesized from a kbp region of the _PROTEIN_ transcript then hydrolyzed into fragments with an average length of bp . consequently there are about seven times as many probe binding sites in the _PROTEIN_ transcript as there is in the much shorter _PROTEIN_ transcript . when the _PROTEIN_ antisense probe was hybridized to _PROTEIN_ materials unlike wild type a strong signal was consistently observed . this agreed with the rt pcr results which also indicated higher _PROTEIN_ in the _PROTEIN_ mutant than in wild type . in seedlings there was little _PROTEIN_ in the shoot apical meristem whereas young leaf primordia showed _PROTEIN_ throughout the lamina of young leaf primordia . in cotyledons and older leaves _PROTEIN_ was restricted to vasculature . the _PROTEIN_ pattern in inflorescences was complex . at stages and of early flower development _PROTEIN_ was present in the center of the floral meristem in the and underlying cells . a weak signal was detected in the inflorescence meristem in the region where a floral meristem was about to initiate . in stage floral buds faint _PROTEIN_ occurred in the center of the floral meristem and also in the sepals . in stage flowers strong _PROTEIN_ was observed in the sepals and in the center of the developing stamens . in stage flowers _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ throughout the _PROTEIN_ and in all other floral organs most strongly over the vasculature . at _PROTEIN_ stages of flower development a strong signal was restricted to the vasculature of the floral organs _PROTEIN_ was also detected in the vasculature of the stem . the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ was generally consistent with extensive _PROTEIN_ during early _PROTEIN_ organ formation resolving to vascular specific _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in development . the analysis of other mutants generated by activation tagging has shown that the genes disrupted usually show greatly elevated levels of _PROTEIN_ but _PROTEIN_ their normal pattern of _PROTEIN_ . because the _PROTEIN_ mutant shows localized _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ broadly consistent with the pattern in wild type seedlings as crudely discerned in rt pcr experiments it is likely that the _PROTEIN_ mutant also confers elevated _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in its normal pattern rather than ectopic _PROTEIN_ . to determine the intracellular localization of the _PROTEIN_ protein we examined young leaves of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgenic arabidopsis plants using confocal microscopy . as shown in figure _METHOD_ signal was localized at the periphery of both palisade and epidermal cells in the transgenic arabidopsis plants . the same localization was observed also in onion epidermal cells that were bombarded with the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgene . to determine whether the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion was localized in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ or in the cell walls plasmolysis was induced with m mannitol . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ localized with the shrunken _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ indicating that it was present in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and not in the cell wall . thus unlike the _METHOD_ control plants in which the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein was localized to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . overexpression of _PROTEIN_ extends the period of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in leaves and eventually leads to the formation of large leaves . therefore we expected that _PROTEIN_ of some cell cycle related genes might be altered in _PROTEIN_ . to identify genes whose _PROTEIN_ level was altered in _PROTEIN_ mutants a microarray analysis was carried out . although cell proliferation activity is reduced in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ levels of genes that control the cell proliferation such as cell cycle related genes were not detectably altered . several genes were dramatically upregulated in _PROTEIN_ but the relationship between these genes and cell proliferation is unclear . there were no genes that were downregulated below levels of wild type gene _PROTEIN_ . genes for which levels of transcripts were at least three times higher in _PROTEIN_ than in wild type are shown . ratio of transcript levels in the _PROTEIN_ mutant to those in wt . database searches revealed other putative arabidopsis proteins with similarity to _PROTEIN_ . these proteins were named rot four _PROTEIN_ . alignment revealed a amino acid region that was conserved between the rtfl members . the region was rich in basic amino acids and had not been previously identified in any other proteins of known function . we named the novel region rtf domain . when a phylogenetic tree was produced from the rtf domain no subclasses were found between the rtfl members . in other plant species such as oryza sativa glycine max populus balsamifera etc. there are ests that encode rtfl members . these hypothetical proteins were not found in non seed plants and animals suggesting that rtfl is a seed plant specific gene family . to further characterize rtfl function in particular the loss of function phenotype we screened existing collections of insertion mutants in arabidopis and rice for insertions that disrupted any rtfl member . such mutations were very rare presumably because the rtfl genes were extremely small and we could not identify any insertion at _PROTEIN_ . however a mutant that carried a t dna insertion within the orf of _PROTEIN_ was identified within the signal collection of arabidopsis t dna insertion lines . the mutation is likely to be null because it disrupts the conserved rtfl domain and was designated as _PROTEIN_ . furthermore we identified two mutants in oryza that carried insertions of the transposon within oryza homologs . these oryza rtfl members were named and and encoded proteins sharing and amino acid identity with _PROTEIN_ within the rtf domain respectively . the two rice mutants also predicted to be severe loss of function alleles were named and respectively . we identified plants that were homozygous for the various mutant alleles . however none of the mutants showed any phenotype that we could discern in _METHOD_ of either organ shape or any other gross morphological character . these results suggest that there might be functional redundancy between several or all rtfl members as might be expected as the family comprises more than members with similar protein sequences . although the rtf domain is conserved between distantly related plant species the regions outside the rtf domain at the n and c terminal ends of the protein are diverged . to investigate the function of the different domains of _PROTEIN_ we generated the constructs _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ which _PROTEIN_ modified proteins that lacked either the n terminal or the c terminal regions of _PROTEIN_ respectively . the constructs were _PROTEIN_ under control of the camv promoter in transgenic arabidopsis plants . in both cases the resulting transgenic plants had short rosette leaves similar to those of _PROTEIN_ mutants . this result suggests that only the conserved rtf domain is required for _PROTEIN_ activity . as in _PROTEIN_ plants which had short siliques the transgenic plants also had short siliques . this phenotype was less severe for plants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ than for those _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . interestingly the siliques of both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ overexpressing plants showed changed shape so that they resembled an arrowhead . a similar phenotype was also reported for plants overexpressing the _PROTEIN_ gene which encodes a cytochrome enzyme . in this case the effects on silique shape were caused by both increased cell proliferation and increased cell enlargement in the carpel valves .
the _PROTEIN_ mutant was isolated in a landsberg _LOCATION_ background that also carried the weak clf mutant allele clf . the _PROTEIN_ mutant was crossed to columbia wild type three times to remove the clf and _LOCATION_ alleles and an identical phenotype was observed indicating that it was independent of the clf or _LOCATION_ background . because the _PROTEIN_ inflorescence phenotype resembled that of _LOCATION_ the absence of the _LOCATION_ mutation was confirmed by a sequence analysis of the _LOCATION_ locus . for analyses of plants seeds were sown on rock wool . after h at in darkness plants were grown under light at at . ages of plants were given in _METHOD_ of days after transfer to . to observe palisade cells leaf tissues were cleared with chloral hydrate solution as described elsewhere . individual cell sizes were measured using the imagej program . to clone genomic dna flanking the t dna insertion plasmid rescue was performed . genomic dna was extracted from _PROTEIN_ mutant plants digested with ecori and ligated overnight under conditions favoring intramolecular ligation . the resulting plasmid contained both and plant genomic dna sequences with a single ecori site . sequence analysis of using a primer designed from sequence indicated the approximate site of the t dna insertion . to confirm the precise t dna insertion site the following oligonucleotides were used for pcr amplification using _PROTEIN_ genomic dna as a template _PROTEIN_ aagccgttaggtttagaggg _PROTEIN_ . amplified dna fragments were sequenced with the _PROTEIN_ primer . the full length

_PROTEIN_ r were used as primers for rt pcr . the rt pcr products were subcloned into _PROTEIN_ and the resultant vector was named _PROTEIN_ . to generate _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgenic plants the binary vector construct _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was first made as follows . _PROTEIN_ dna was pcr amplified from _PROTEIN_ template dna using the oligonucleotides _PROTEIN_ gly f and _PROTEIN_ gly r in order to remove the _PROTEIN_ stop codon and to introduce an ncoi site and a glycine linker . the product was subcloned into _PROTEIN_ to produce _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ was digested by ecori blunted using a dna blunting kit and then digested with ncoi . the vector which carries the _METHOD_ gene under control of the camv promoter was digested with sali blunted as described above and then digested with ncoi . these two fragments were ligated to produce rot _METHOD_ . was digested with hindiii and ecori to remove the _PROTEIN_ gene and then ligated to the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ gene which was excised from _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ by hindiii and ecori digestion . similarly plasmid vector constructs _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were made as follows . _PROTEIN_ dna was pcr amplified from _PROTEIN_ template dna using the oligonucleotides _PROTEIN_ f _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ r in order to remove the n terminus region of _PROTEIN_ and to add the first methionine codon . _PROTEIN_ dna was pcr amplified using the oligonucleotides _PROTEIN_ f and _PROTEIN_ r in order to remove the c terminus region of _PROTEIN_ and to add the stop codon . each dna fragment was inserted in _PROTEIN_ . the dna

using the simplified floral dip method . transgenic plants were selected on murashige and skoog medium containing mg gellan gum bialaphos and claforan . reverse transcriptions were carried out using the super script ii rt and the _PROTEIN_ primer of the _PROTEIN_ system . for amplification of _PROTEIN_ cdna _PROTEIN_ f and _PROTEIN_ r were used . as a control the following oligonucleotides were

for min then cycles for _PROTEIN_ cdna amplification or cycles for _PROTEIN_ cdna amplification at for sec for sec and for sec . a bp fragment from the end of the _PROTEIN_ gene that had no similarity with any other sequence in the arabidopsis genome was amplified from genomic dna by pcr using the primers _PROTEIN_ f and _PROTEIN_ r . the product was ligated to the vector pgem teasy to produce the clones and which contained the _PROTEIN_ insert in opposite orientations relative to the promoter . sense and antisense probes were synthesized using rna polymerase and or templates were linearized

family member was found in the salk t dna insertion collection namely accession which carries an insertion in _PROTEIN_ . in o. sativa l. two mutants with a transposon insertion in the cording region
