pyridoxine is a cofactor required by numerous enzymes in all cellular _METHOD_ . plants are the major source of vitamin for animals yet the biosynthesis pathway and the function of vitamin in plants are not well elucidated . in this study an arabidopsis pyridoxine synthase gene _PROTEIN_ was characterized and its in vivo functions were investigated . the _PROTEIN_ gene was _PROTEIN_ in all plant parts examined and its _PROTEIN_ level was not significantly regulated by abiotic stress or the phytohormone abscisic acid . in roots _PROTEIN_ was highly _PROTEIN_ in a defined region behind the root tips that undergoes rapid cell division . the _PROTEIN_ protein was _PROTEIN_ associated with the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and endomembranes implying a potential involvement of vitamin in _LOCATION_ function . to reveal the in vivo role of _PROTEIN_ arabidopsis insertional mutants were isolated . strikingly the _PROTEIN_ knockout mutants were impaired in root growth and early seedling development . the stunted roots resulted from both reduced cell division and elongation . supplementation of the growth media with pyridoxine or reintroduction of the wild type _PROTEIN_ gene into the mutants completely restored the mutant growth demonstrating that _PROTEIN_ is required for pyridoxine biosynthesis in planta . in addition to the developmental defects _PROTEIN_ mutants are hypersensitive to osmotic stress and oxidative stress . these mutant seedlings had increased peroxidation of _LOCATION_ lipids following uv treatment . our study establishes a critical role of vitamin in plant development and stress tolerance and suggests that vitamin may represent a new class of antioxidant in plants .
the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was initially isolated in a yeast two hybrid screen as a protein that interacts with a scaffold protein involved in root _PROTEIN_ to drought and salt stress . the predicted _PROTEIN_ was noted as a putative protein similar to stress responsive proteins . to obtain the _PROTEIN_ cdna reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction was conducted using total rna isolated from wild type arabidopsis . comparison of the cdna with the genomic dna indicates that the open reading frame of _PROTEIN_ consists of one exon without any introns . the predicted protein has amino acid residues with a molecular weight of kda . database searching found that _PROTEIN_ shows high similarity to members of the sor/snz family proteins found in fungi archaebacteria and some eubacteria . homologous sequences also exist in other plant species including rice rubber tree common bean and gingko . _PROTEIN_ is phylogenetically more closely related to these plant homologs than to its counterparts in other _METHOD_ . in the arabidopsis genome there are two more _PROTEIN_ like proteins _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ which share and amino acid sequence identity with _PROTEIN_ respectively . a third protein _PROTEIN_ is also closely related to _PROTEIN_ but the predicted protein lacks the c terminal extension and is shorter than _PROTEIN_ and the other two proteins . the _PROTEIN_ protein shares amino acid sequence similarity with the yeast protein _PROTEIN_ a member of the sor/snz family that was recently shown to be involved in pyridoxine synthesis . to test whether _PROTEIN_ functions in pyridoxine synthesis in plants we first investigated whether _PROTEIN_ could complement the yeast pyridoxine auxotrophic mutant . the _PROTEIN_ cdna was cloned into the pesc his vector and transferred into cells . as a control the pesc his empty vector was also separately transferred into cells . on media lacking pyridoxine the transformants grew nearly as well as the wild type cells whereas those transformed with the empty pesc his vector were defective in their growth as compared with the wild type cells . the complementation of the mutant by the _PROTEIN_ gene indicates that arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ is functionally exchangeable with yeast _PROTEIN_ . to investigate where the _PROTEIN_ gene is _PROTEIN_ total rna from roots _METHOD_ leaves flowers and siliques was extracted and subject to rna blotting analysis using _PROTEIN_ cdna as a probe . it was found that _PROTEIN_ transcripts were detected at similar levels in all plant parts examined . as _PROTEIN_ was noted to be similar to stress responsive proteins we asked whether abiotic stresses could regulate the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ . it was found that _PROTEIN_ transcript levels were not enhanced by either salt stress or the stress hormone abscisic acid . rather salt or aba treatments slightly _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ transcript levels . consistent with our rna blotting analysis microarray experiments also showed that _PROTEIN_ gene _PROTEIN_ was not significantly regulated by cold salt drought or aba treatment suggesting that the _PROTEIN_ gene may be constitutively _PROTEIN_ . transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ promoter driven _PROTEIN_ reporter gene were also obtained in order to examine the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ at the tissue level . in young seedlings _PROTEIN_ promoter activity was detected in cotyledons with especially strong signals in guard cells and vascular tissues . in roots the highest _PROTEIN_ was observed in rapidly growing stele tissues near the root tips . however the gus signal was very faint or not detectable in root tips . gus _PROTEIN_ was also observed in root hairs and vascular tissues of _METHOD_ . in floral organs gus _PROTEIN_ was evident in mature pollen grains and filaments the tips of young siliques and the joint region of the silique and pedicel . the most pronounced gus staining was detected around the cutting sites suggesting that wounding may induce _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . to explore the potential regulation of the _PROTEIN_ promoter by wounding related signals leaves of the _PROTEIN_ gus transgenic plants were treated with jasmonic acid ethephon or uv light . however none of these treatments obviously induced reporter gene _PROTEIN_ . although several sor/snz family members have recently been characterized in non plant _METHOD_ no information was available about the subcellular localization of any _PROTEIN_ like proteins . sequence analysis of the _PROTEIN_ protein failed to detect any clear signal peptides . to start revealing the subcellular sites of vitamin biosynthesis and its regulation we generated stable transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ the green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion protein . as showed in figure surprisingly _PROTEIN_ was found to be _PROTEIN_ associated with the _LOCATION_ system including the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and all the endomembranes _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . a fraction of the protein may be also localized in the cytoplasm . in root cells the association of _PROTEIN_ with the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ is particularly clear . to further demonstrate that the _PROTEIN_ protein is associated with the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ rather than the cell wall _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ transgenic seedlings were incubated in sucrose to induce plasmolysis . figure shows that in plasmolysed root hairs _PROTEIN_ protein was associated with the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ but not the cell wall . to confirm that _METHOD_ has no effect on _PROTEIN_ localization and function the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ gene was also transferred into the _PROTEIN_ knockout mutant . analysis of the phenotypes confirmed that _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ complemented the _PROTEIN_ mutant defects indicating that _METHOD_ does not interfere with _PROTEIN_ functions and that the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ localization may reflect the natural localization of the _PROTEIN_ protein . to investigate the in vivo function of _PROTEIN_ two putative t dna insertional mutant lines were obtained from the arabidopsis biological resource center . using sequence specific primers pcr based genotyping was conducted and mutants homologous to the t dna insertions were recovered . these two mutant lines _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were backcrossed to the wild type plants and were used in the following experiments . because the two mutants have identical phenotypes only the data obtained with _PROTEIN_ are reported here . it was found that the _PROTEIN_ mutants have striking phenotypes distinct from those of the wild type plants . after germination the growth of the mutant seedlings was slower and the seedlings were smaller than the wild type . most strikingly the mutant plants had very short primary roots and this phenotype became more severe when plants were grown on media with an increased amount of sucrose which stimulates root growth rate . the stunted root growth of _PROTEIN_ may result from a defect in either cell division or cell elongation or both . examination of the roots revealed that _PROTEIN_ roots had shorter mature cortical cells and a smaller meristem . to estimate the root meristem size the number of cortical cells from the initial cell up to the first rapidly elongating cell was counted . it was found that the number of cells in the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was only about that of the wild type . these data indicate that the _PROTEIN_ mutant roots are impaired both in cell division and in cell elongation . in addition to the stunted roots the leaves of _PROTEIN_ seedlings were yellowish both in murashige and skoog _METHOD_ plates and in soil . examination of _PROTEIN_ chloroplasts did not find a clear alteration in structure and thus the altered coloration may result from altered pigmentation . measurement of leaf chlorophyll a and b and carotenoid contents showed that their levels in the _PROTEIN_ mutants were significantly lower than in the wild type . this may reflect distorted synthesis of these pigments given that pyridoxine is a cofactor for many metabolic reactions . to test whether these phenotypes observed in _PROTEIN_ are the result of defects in the _PROTEIN_ gene and its product we first supplemented the growth media with pyridoxine to see if it could complement the mutant phenotypes . while supplying the _METHOD_ medium with pyridoxine did not have a clear effect on the growth of the wild type seedlings it completely restored _PROTEIN_ root and seedling growth as well as leaf coloration to levels indistinguishable from those of the wild type plants . these data further confirm that _PROTEIN_ is essential for the biosynthesis of pyridoxine and that deficiency in pyridoxine is responsible for the growth and developmental defects of the _PROTEIN_ mutants . to ascertain that the _PROTEIN_ gene is the sole cause of the growth defects in _PROTEIN_ mutants we also performed in planta transgenic complementation assays . binary vectors with the wild type _PROTEIN_ cdna under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus promoter or the _PROTEIN_ cdna fused with the _METHOD_ gene under the control of the promoter were respectively transferred into _PROTEIN_ mutant plants via floral dipping . around individual transformants for each construct were assayed for their growth developmental or salt stress phenotypes . it was found that both constructs were able to completely complement the mutant phenotypes . to determine whether _PROTEIN_ is required for stress tolerance in arabidopsis we first checked the sensitivity of _PROTEIN_ mutants to salt stress . to avoid the complications resulted from different root length or growth between _PROTEIN_ and wild type seedlings we germinated and grew both wild type and _PROTEIN_ mutant seedlings on _METHOD_ agar plates supplemented with pyridoxine . under these conditions the wild type and _PROTEIN_ mutants were very similar in shoot and root growth . seven days after seed germination the seedlings were transferred to regular _METHOD_ plates with or without nacl . it was found that _PROTEIN_ mutant seedlings were much more sensitive to salt stress in that they had slower root and shoot growth . longer exposure to salt stress killed the _PROTEIN_ mutants whereas wild type seedlings survived the stress suggesting that de novo and continuous biosynthesis of vitamin is required for plant salt tolerance . in addition to the above assay on agar plates we also tested the sensitivity of _PROTEIN_ mutants to salt stress in the soil . for this purpose day old wild type and _PROTEIN_ seedlings grown on _METHOD_ agar plates supplemented with pyridoxine were transferred into the soil and were irrigated with different concentrations of nacl . it was found that _PROTEIN_ seedlings were also more sensitive to salt stress than the wild type plants under every tested concentration of salt . salt stress may involve an ionic stress component and also an osmotic stress component . to determine whether _PROTEIN_ is hypersensitive to ionic stress or general osmotic stress wild type and _PROTEIN_ seedlings were assayed for their response to mannitol a solute that generates _PROTEIN_ osmotic stress but not ionic stress . when transferred to an _METHOD_ medium supplemented with mm mannitol _PROTEIN_ mutant seedlings died in about days whereas the wild type seedlings were able to survive the stress . thus _PROTEIN_ mutants were hypersensitive to general osmotic stress in addition to ionic stress . it is known that drought and salt stresses induce the accumulation of ros such as superoxide hydrogen peroxide and hydroxyl radicals . given the _PROTEIN_ that pyridoxine acts as a strong singlet oxygen scavenger in fungi and _PROTEIN_ mutants are hypersensitive to salt and osmotic stresses it is likely that _PROTEIN_ mutants may be more sensitive to oxidative stress . to test this possibility rose bengal _PROTEIN_ was used to treat wild type and _PROTEIN_ seedlings . rose bengal is a photosensitizer that can generate singlet oxygen upon illumination and thus imposes strong oxidative stress . wild type and _PROTEIN_ mutants were first grown in _METHOD_ plates supplemented with pyridoxine . these seedlings were then transferred to _METHOD_ media with or _PROTEIN_ but without pyridoxine supplement . figure shows that both the shoot growth and the root growth of _PROTEIN_ mutants were greatly inhibited by _PROTEIN_ treatments . prolonged exposure to _PROTEIN_ eventually killed the mutant seedlings . the hypersensitivity of _PROTEIN_ mutants to _PROTEIN_ indicates that pyridoxine is an essential quencher of ros in plants . although pyridoxine has been suggested as an antioxidant in fungi the underlying _METHOD_ are unknown . reactive oxygen species can directly cause _LOCATION_ lipid peroxidation . as _PROTEIN_ appears to be associated with _LOCATION_ we asked whether _PROTEIN_ has any role in protecting _LOCATION_ from lipid peroxidation . malondialdehyde is a byproduct of polyunsaturated fatty acid peroxidation and its level has long been used to estimate the extent of lipid peroxidation using the thiobarbituric acid reactive substance assay . as uv treatments can cause lipid peroxidation in plants we investigated whether _PROTEIN_ has any role in protecting _LOCATION_ lipids from uv induced lipid peroxidation . the mda level in the _PROTEIN_ mutant was measured after uv treatment . figure shows that without uv treatment there was not much difference between the wild type and _PROTEIN_ in mda level . however after min of uv treatment _PROTEIN_ mutant generated a much higher level of mda than the wild type indicating that endogenous pyridoxine can protect cellular _LOCATION_ from lipid peroxidation .
arabidopsis thaliana ecotype columbia was used in all experiments . the _PROTEIN_ t dna lines and were obtained from the arabidopsis biological resource center . seeds were surface sterilized with bleach plus triton and planted onto half _METHOD_ media supplemented with sucrose and agar . for rescue of _PROTEIN_ mutants pyridoxine was added into the medium . after days of cold treatment plates were incubated at under constant white light for seed germination and seedling growth . for root growth assays plates with agar were incubated vertically and seedlings were photographed using a digital camera . the primary root lengths of seedlings were measured using the national institutes of health _PROTEIN_ imaging software . soil grown plants were kept in a growth room at with a h light period . _PROTEIN_ cdna was amplified with primers caccatggaaggaaccggcgttgt and ctcggagcgattagcgaac . a kb _PROTEIN_ promoter was amplified and the fragment was ligated into the pentr d topo vector . after sequence confirmation the cdna and promoter fragment were cloned into the pmdc gateway vector through lr clonase recombination . the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion construct the promoter driven overexpression constructs and the _PROTEIN_ promoter driven gus reporter construct were made with the respective gateway vectors . agrobacterium tumefaciens was transformed by electroporation with these constructs . four week old arabidopsis plants were then vacuum infiltrated with the transformed a. tumefaciens strains and transformants were screened using respective antibiotics . for pigment measurements fresh leaves were ground in absolute ethanol and after centrifugation the supernatant was measured for its absorbance at and nm . pigment contents were calculated according to citation . for all stress treatments the wild type and _PROTEIN_ seeds were first planted on _METHOD_ agar plates supplemented with pyridoxine . one week old seedlings were transferred to respective treatment plates . for rose bengal treatment seedlings were transferred to plates containing or rose bengal and pictures were taken weeks after the transfer . for salt and mannitol treatment seedlings were transferred from _METHOD_ plate to _METHOD_ medium containing mm nacl or mm mannitol . all agar plates were incubated under constant light at for seedling growth . for the assay of salt tolerance in soil day old wild type and _PROTEIN_ seedlings grown on pyridoxine supplemented _METHOD_ agar plates were transferred into the soil . five days _PROTEIN_ they were irrigated with or mm nacl . ten days after starting the salt treatment pictures of these seedlings were taken . lipid peroxidation was estimated by measuring the mda content after uv treatment . soil grown plants were treated in stratalinker uv crosslinker at for or min and h _PROTEIN_ leaves were collected for extraction . the method described by citation was followed for extraction measurement and calculation of mda . total rna was extracted from various organs of the wild type plants grown under a h photoperiod using _PROTEIN_ reagent according to the manufacturer 's manual . for stress treatments whole seedlings were treated with aba or mm nacl for or h respectively before extraction of total rna . ten _METHOD_ of total rna was loaded onto formaldehyde agarose gels . rna gel blots were autoradiographed to a phosphoimage screen and the signals were quantified using imagequant . a bp tubulin probe was used as a loading control . seedlings or tissues from transgenic plants were vacuumed in staining solution _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ for min before staining at . after staining the solution was replaced with ethanol to remove chlorophyll . ja and ethephon treatments were performed by floating detached leaves in mm ja or mm ethephon for h before gus staining . uv treatment was conducted by treating the detached leaves in a stratagene uv crosslinker at w for min . for observing _METHOD_ localization whole seedlings were mounted in water or sucrose under glass coverslips and the _METHOD_ signal was visualized using a confocal microscope equipped with a kryptonargon laser . differential interference contrast images of root tips and cortical cells were taken with a nikon _PROTEIN_ microscope and a qimaging retiga cooled camera . the _PROTEIN_ cdna was amplified and ligated into the pesc his vector . the yeast mutant was transformed following the protocol of clontech . transformed yeast was cultured in synthetic dropout medium without pyridoxine for h before spotting onto solid minimal medium or inoculation in a minimal medium to an optical density of for subculture .
