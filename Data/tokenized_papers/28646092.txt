_PROTEIN_ a plant acap type adp ribosylation _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ activating protein functions in specifying root hair _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis thaliana . to better understand how _PROTEIN_ modulates root hair growth we generated full length and domain deleted _PROTEIN_ green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ constructs and followed their localization during root hair development . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ localized to the cytoplasm and was recruited to specific regions of the root hair _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . distinct pm _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signal was first detected along the site of root hair bulge formation . the construct continued to mark the pm at the root hair apical dome but only during periods of reduced growth . during rapid tip growth _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ labeled the pm of the _PROTEIN_ flanks and dissipated from the apical most pm . deletion analysis and a single domain _METHOD_ fusion revealed that the pleckstrin homology domain is the minimal unit required for recruitment of _PROTEIN_ to the pm . our results indicate that differential recruitment of _PROTEIN_ to specific pm domains is an essential component of the _LOCATION_ trafficking machinery that facilitates root hair developmental phase transitions and responses to changes in the root microenvironment .
when an _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ construct under the control of its native promoter _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was _PROTEIN_ in the _PROTEIN_ mutant we found that the wavy root hair growth and two root hair tips from one initiation point defects of the mutant were rescued indicating that the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ construct was functional . consistent with the role of _PROTEIN_ in root hair development the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signal was enriched in root hair forming trichoblasts . close examination of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ uncovered three patterns of localization in roots . first _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signal marked the ends of the cells in the primary root meristem and transition zone a pattern indicative of pm localization . second diffuse _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signal within the cell interior also indicated cytoplasmic localization of the construct . third _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was associated with punctate bodies of varying sizes . in root hair cells some bodies moved slowly while others moved rapidly throughout the cell . the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ bodies observed in primary roots and root hairs were reminiscent of _METHOD_ foci typical of the endomembrane system . furthermore previous studies of other arabidopsis arf gaps showed that they localized to _LOCATION_ and post _LOCATION_ compartments leading us to hypothesize that the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ puncta might also represent known endomembrane organelles .to test this hypothesis we generated arabidopsis lines _PROTEIN_ both _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and mcherry markers for the tgn/ee _PROTEIN_ endosomes/prevacuolar compartment _PROTEIN_ and _LOCATION_ and asked if the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ bodies colocalized with any of the mcherry endomembrane foci . surprisingly confocal imaging of growing root hairs revealed that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ bodies did not overlap with compartments decorated by all of the endomembrane mcherry markers available to us . imaging of dual labeled root cells verified that dynamic green and red bodies corresponding to _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and endomembrane mcherry fusions respectively did not overlap . further verification that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ foci were distinct from post _LOCATION_ compartments was obtained by examining roots treated with brefeldin a . upon exposure to bfa tgn/ee mcherry markers in the root hair formed _METHOD_ agglomerates a behavior typical of post _LOCATION_ organelles . however _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ remained in discrete foci that did not overlap with the red emitting bfa bodies . we also treated roots with wortmannin a chemical that triggers homotypic fusion of the _PROTEIN_ in plant cells . when seedlings were exposed to wortmannin the pvc markers _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mcherry and _PROTEIN_ mcherry formed structures that were reminiscent of the fused pvcs reported previously . by contrast _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ remained in discrete foci that did not overlap with the red emitting fused pvc bodies . in addition to its localization to unknown foci and the cytoplasm we found that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ marked the pm of developing root hairs . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signal in root hair pm was first detected at a domain of the trichoblast where a small root hair bulge formed . this observation was in contrast to other proteins known to mark the site of root hair emergence such as the rho of plants family of small _PROTEIN_ which have been reported to accumulate at the pm of the root hair initiation site prior to bulge formation . indeed no _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signal at the pm of root hair initiation sites could be observed in files of trichoblasts in the root transition and elongation zones . by contrast in wild type plants a _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ enhanced yellow _METHOD_ protein fusion _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ accumulated at the pm of the root hair initiation site prior to the appearance of a root hair bulge . we next followed the time course of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ pm localization as root hairs transitioned through the various developmental phases . we found that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ continued to mark the apical most pm domains of expanding root hair bulges and as they transitioned to tip growth . however as root hairs proceeded to rapid tip growth _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ localization to the apical most pm domain became less intense and eventually dissipated . distinct _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signal was confined to the pm of the root hair flanks while gradually weakening as root hairs continued to rapidly elongate . as the root hairs matured and tip growth ceased intense _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ returned to the apical most pm domain . finally _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signal at all pm domains of the root hair dissipated as the cytoplasm dispersed and the _LOCATION_ protruded toward the tip . we quantified changes in _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ pm localization by obtaining the ratio of pm tip _METHOD_ to pm _METHOD_ along the _PROTEIN_ flanks of root hairs . in the case of root hair bulges pm _METHOD_ along the more apical pm was obtained following the method of citation . plotting root hair growth rate and the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ tip/flank _METHOD_ ratio as a function of time in a double y graph revealed that a higher tip/flank ratio was associated with periods of slower root hair growth . slower root hair growth occurred during the onset of bulge formation and as the root hair transitioned to tip growth and then again as the root hairs matured . during periods of rapid tip growth the tip to flank _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ pm _METHOD_ ratio was significantly lower . a scatter plot revealed a strong inverse relationship between root hair growth rate and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ pm _METHOD_ with a pearson 's correlation coefficient of . our results support that _PROTEIN_ location at distinct pm domains is correlated with root hair growth status . whereas _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ localization at the apical most pm domain was associated with slower root hair growth rate during phase and signal at the pm tip dissipated and was confined to the _PROTEIN_ pm in rapidly elongating root hairs at phase . we therefore hypothesized that when _PROTEIN_ is localized to the apical most pm domain of the root hair tip it functions in fine tuning tip growth most likely as a negative regulator . to test this hypothesis we prematurely terminated the growth of root hairs at phase by subjecting seedlings _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ to a hyperosmotic shock using mannitol . prior to mannitol application young and old root hairs of lines _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion at phase showed the typical flank pm localization and lack of _METHOD_ signal at the apical most pm domain . liquid growth medium supplemented with mm mannitol was then injected into the semi solid gel that supported the seedling roots and roots were immediately imaged . within min of mannitol application we found intense _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signal at the apical most pm domain of root hairs at phase that coincided with shrinkage of the tip cytoplasm and stoppage of tip growth . we observed that many root hairs at phase were able to resume tip growth within min after exposure to mannitol . resumption of tip growth was accompanied by dissipation of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ at the apical most pm domain and relocalization of the fusion protein to the _PROTEIN_ pm an observation reminiscent of changes in the localization of the fusion protein as root hairs transitioned from slow tip growth in phase to rapid tip growth in phase . the correlation between _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ localization to the apical most root hair pm apex and root hair growth status was also observed in other treatments that inhibited tip growth . for example like mannitol treatment with sodium chloride led to relocalization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ to the apical most pm domain of phase root hairs within min . however unlike in mannitol phase root hairs exposed to nacl were not able to quickly resume tip growth . as such localization to the apical most pm domain persisted in these nongrowing root hairs . taken together our results support that recruitment of _PROTEIN_ to the apical most pm domain of root hair is associated with root hairs that either grow slowly or terminate tip growth due to an external stimulus . previous characterization of the _PROTEIN_ mutant focused on the wavy growth patterns of elongating root hairs at phase . although the increased frequency of two root hairs emerging from one initiation point in _PROTEIN_ mutants is consistent with the localization of _PROTEIN_ at the pm of root hair bulges observed here it is possible that other phenotypes related to root hair initiation might have been overlooked . we therefore asked whether _PROTEIN_ exhibited any planar _PROTEIN_ defects given that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ localized at the pm during early root hair bulge formation . in root hair development planar _PROTEIN_ refers to the position of the root hair initiation site which is typically directed toward the basal end of the trichoblast . we found that there was a slight but statistically significant apical shift in root hair position in _PROTEIN_ mutants compared to wild type . like other root hair phenotypes this mild apical shift in planar _PROTEIN_ was reversed in _PROTEIN_ lines _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ construct . our results indicate that _PROTEIN_ has a subtle role in defining the position of root hair initiation sites . the plant class arf gaps are the most complex as they have three other domains in addition to the catalytic gap domain . however the contribution of these domains to _PROTEIN_ function and subcellular localization has never been addressed . we therefore generated a series of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ constructs with single protein domains deleted . the constructs were placed under the control of an estradiol inducible promoter and _PROTEIN_ in the _PROTEIN_ mutant background to simultaneously test functionality of the domain deletion constructs and impact of the deleted domains on _PROTEIN_ localization . for unknown reasons we were unable to isolate _PROTEIN_ lines _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusions with only the bar domain deleted _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . the constructs we were able to analyze included ph _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ gap _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ domain deletions as well as full length _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . non induced _PROTEIN_ mutants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and all deletion domain constructs showed the root hair _PROTEIN_ defects observed in untransformed _PROTEIN_ including the increased frequency of two root hairs originating from a single initiation point . by contrast and consistent with results obtained with the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ complemented _PROTEIN_ lines induction with estradiol rescued the root hair defects of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ construct indicating functionality of the full length _PROTEIN_ fusion under the inducible system . however root hair defects of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were not rescued by estradiol application . upon examination of _METHOD_ signals in root hairs of the estradiol induced seedlings we found that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ lines showed _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ patterns at the root hair pm that mirrored the spatiotemporal changes observed in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ complemented _PROTEIN_ lines . like _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ lines estradiol induced _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ lines showed _METHOD_ signal that marked the pm of bulging root hairs the _PROTEIN_ pm of root hairs undergoing rapid tip growth and the pm at the apical most pm domain of root hairs that ceased growth . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signal resulting from inducible _PROTEIN_ of the promoter was generally weaker compared to the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ lines . furthermore the unidentified bodies that were typically observed in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ lines were not as numerous as in estradiol induced _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ lines . we next examined the localization of the three _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ domain deleted constructs after estradiol induction . we found that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ no longer marked the pm and was exclusively in the cytoplasm during all phases of root hair development . by contrast _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ still marked the pm of bulging root hairs and the pm along the flanks of root hairs that proceeded to tip growth a pattern that roughly mirrored that of full length _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . compared to full length _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ the signal of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was generally weaker . the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ constructs did not complement the _PROTEIN_ root hair shape defects and their localization along the pm flanks of phase root hairs was often asymmetric . the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ constructs did not label the unidentified bodies decorated by full length _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . although the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ construct also labeled numerous _METHOD_ aggregates these foci were smaller and more heterogeneous in size compared to those marked by full length _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . the localization of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ deletion constructs indicated that the ph domain is required for pm localization . however because we were unable to isolate plant lines _PROTEIN_ the inducible _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion we could not conclude if the bar domain contributed to the recruitment of _PROTEIN_ to the root hair pm . to address this question we generated a _METHOD_ construct to the _PROTEIN_ ph domain alone _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ it in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . upon induction with estradiol we found that ph _METHOD_ had diffuse signal in the root hair cytoplasm that was more intense than the _LOCATION_ signal observed in full length _PROTEIN_ and the other _PROTEIN_ deletion constructs . despite the strong cytoplasmic signal ph _METHOD_ could be detected in the pm as the root hair progressed through the different developmental phases . however unlike full length _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or the gap and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ deletion constructs ph _METHOD_ was often observed to _PROTEIN_ pm localization at the apical most pm domain of root hairs . like the gap and _PROTEIN_ deletion constructs ph _METHOD_ did not complement the _PROTEIN_ root hair defects . localization of ph _METHOD_ was also often observed to be unevenly localized to the pm along the _PROTEIN_ flanks as root hairs developed . ph _METHOD_ tip/flank _METHOD_ was quantified in a similar manner to that for _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . like full length _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ there was an inverse relationship between ph _METHOD_ pm localization and root hair growth rate . however a scatter plot and pearson 's correlation analysis indicated a weaker inverse relationship between ph _METHOD_ pm localization and root hair growth rate when compared with full length _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . the ph domain is known to bind _PROTEIN_ . in doing so proteins that have them are recruited to specific cell _LOCATION_ regions by binding to _PROTEIN_ that are enriched in that particular _LOCATION_ . we therefore hypothesized that _PROTEIN_ through its ph domain could be targeted to the root hair pm by binding to specific pools of _PROTEIN_ that are enriched in root hair cells . to test this hypothesis we first asked whether the _PROTEIN_ ph domain alone is capable of directly binding _PROTEIN_ . we cloned the _PROTEIN_ ph domain and generated a glutathione s transferase _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ ph domain construct _PROTEIN_ . purified _PROTEIN_ ph or _PROTEIN_ alone was used in lipid overlay assays on nitrocellulose strips blotted with a range of phospholipids . we found that _PROTEIN_ ph but not the _PROTEIN_ only controls bound to _PROTEIN_ monophosphates namely phosphatidylinositol phosphate _PROTEIN_ phosphatidylinositol phosphate _PROTEIN_ and phosphatidylinositol phosphate _PROTEIN_ . direct binding of the _PROTEIN_ ph domain to _PROTEIN_ monophosphates prompted us to next ask if the localization of specific _PROTEIN_ in root hair cells mirrored that of ph _METHOD_ . to address this question we followed the localization of in vivo _PROTEIN_ p _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ p _METHOD_ markers during root hair development . we found that _METHOD_ localized to endosomes and the tonoplast similar to a previous report but did not label the pm in phase and phase root hairs . by contrast _METHOD_ marked the pm of root hairs in a similar manner to ph _METHOD_ . like ph _METHOD_ and full length _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was not enriched at the pm of the future root hair initiation site . a clear enrichment of _METHOD_ pm _METHOD_ only became obvious when there was a visible root hair bulge . the _PROTEIN_ p biosensor continued to mark the pm as the root hair bulge enlarged and proceeded to broadly label the tip and flank pm as the root hairs proceeded to phase . as root hairs rapidly elongated _METHOD_ signal became strongest along the apical of the tip similar to previous reports . the enrichment of _METHOD_ along a broad region of the pm apical dome of phase root hairs resembled that of ph _METHOD_ localization . like ph _METHOD_ _METHOD_ pm localization and root hair growth rate had an inverse relationship . the similar patterns of ph _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ enrichment during root hair development suggest that enriched pools of _PROTEIN_ p recruits _PROTEIN_ to the pm . furthermore our results on the localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and ph _METHOD_ support the conclusion that the ph domain is the minimal unit needed for targeting _PROTEIN_ to the root hair pm .
