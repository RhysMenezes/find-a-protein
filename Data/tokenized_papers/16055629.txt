in mammals electron transfer flavoprotein ubiquinone oxidoreductase _PROTEIN_ and electron transfer flavoprotein are functionally associated and etf accepts electrons from at least nine mitochondrial _PROTEIN_ flavoprotein dehydrogenases and transfers them to ubiquinone in the inner mitochondrial _LOCATION_ . in addition the mammalian etf/etfqo system plays a key role in oxidation of fatty acids and catabolism of amino acids and choline . by contrast nothing is known of the function of etf and _PROTEIN_ in plants . sequence analysis of the unique arabidopsis thaliana homologue of _PROTEIN_ revealed high similarity to the mammalian _PROTEIN_ protein . moreover green _METHOD_ protein cellular localization experiments suggested a mitochondrial location for this protein . rna gel blot analysis revealed that arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ transcripts accumulated in long term dark treated leaves . analysis of three independent insertional mutants of arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ revealed a dramatic reduction in their ability to withstand extended darkness resulting in senescence and death within d after transfer whereas wild type plants remained viable for at least d. metabolite profiling of dark treated leaves of the wild type and mutants revealed a dramatic decline in sugar levels . in contrast with the wild type the mutants demonstrated a significant accumulation of several amino acids an intermediate of leu catabolism and strikingly high level accumulation of phytanoyl coa . these data demonstrate the involvement of a mitochondrial protein _PROTEIN_ in the catabolism of leu and potentially of other amino acids in higher plants and also imply a novel role for this protein in the chlorophyll degradation pathway activated during dark induced senescence and sugar starvation .
we have identified a homologue of _PROTEIN_ in the arabidopsis genome designated as _PROTEIN_ that encodes a protein with similarity to human _PROTEIN_ . the mammalian _PROTEIN_ is a unique integral _LOCATION_ protein containing one equivalent of flavin adenine dinucleotide and a cluster characteristics shared with the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ . the n terminal sequence of the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ protein has characteristics consistent with that of a mitochondrial transit peptide and is predicted to target _PROTEIN_ to the _LOCATION_ by the three targeting prediction _METHOD_ predotar mitoprot ii and psort consistent with the location of mammalian _PROTEIN_ in mitochondria . alignment of the amino acid sequence of arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ to homologues from bacteria to human shows a high overall similarity including a putative fad binding domain and cluster domain . taken together the above observations give strong support to our claim that arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ is a functional homologue of _PROTEIN_ from other _METHOD_ . in order to confirm the in vivo subcellular localization of arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ a full length cdna fragment was fused to the cdna of _METHOD_ . the cdna fusion construct was subcloned downstream of the cauliflower mosaic virus rna promoter and transformed into arabidopsis . five day old seedlings of stable transformants were incubated with mitotracker orange for specific staining of mitochondria . inspection of the seedlings transformed with the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ construct by confocal microscopy revealed that the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ within root cells was restricted to numerous spherical or elongated bodies which correspond well with mitochondrial morphology . the colocalization of the mitotracker orange dye and the _METHOD_ signal in root cells confirmed mitochondrial targeting of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein . these data clearly demonstrate the mitochondrial targeting of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein in vivo and thus establish the mitochondrial localization of the _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis . the _PROTEIN_ gene is represented on the affymetrix _PROTEIN_ genome array and analysis of microarray data stored in the genevestigator database revealed that _PROTEIN_ transcripts are _PROTEIN_ constitutively at a low level in all plant tissues and developmental states including leaf senescence however intriguingly it was highly _PROTEIN_ in dark induced senescent leaves senescent cell cultures and sucrose starved cell cultures . rna gel blot analysis confirmed that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was not significantly induced during normal developmental senescence . to further investigate regulation of _PROTEIN_ transcript levels were measured in week old arabidopsis leaves following transfer to darkness by rna gel blot analysis . during dark _PROTEIN_ the transcripts from a light regulated photosynthetic gene _PROTEIN_ gradually declined whereas the _PROTEIN_ transcripts accumulated to very high levels . as a positive control the transcript levels of the isovaleryl coa dehydrogenase gene _PROTEIN_ and the subunit of branched chain keto dehydrogenase gene which have previously been shown to be induced by sucrose starvation were analyzed . the _PROTEIN_ and bckdh transcripts also accumulated in the dark _PROTEIN_ leaves suggesting that _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ gene is also induced by sucrose starvation following prolonged darkness . to investigate the in vivo functions of the _PROTEIN_ protein three independent arabidopsis lines containing t dna or dissociation transposon element insertional mutations of _PROTEIN_ were isolated . segregation of the encoded resistance markers of all three insertion elements were in good agreement with the ratio suggesting insertion at a single mendelian locus . homozygous lines for each mutant were confirmed by genomic pcr and designated _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ respectively and the respective sites of insertion of these mutants were confirmed by sequencing pcr products amplified from each mutant . as described above _PROTEIN_ contains a putative cluster domain near its c terminus that is likely to be required for electron flow from flavin to ubiquinone . in all three mutant lines the insertional element is positioned upstream of the putative cluster and it would be anticipated that this would severely compromise its electron transfer capacity and so result in a complete loss of functional protein . rt pcr using primer pairs designated to span the t dna insertion site of each mutant locus was used to investigate _PROTEIN_ transcription . the arabidopsis tubulin gene was used as a control to demonstrate the integrity of the rna preparation . _PROTEIN_ mrnas were detected in the wild type _LOCATION_ using the primer sets and . in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ transcripts were detected using the primer set however no amplification products were observed for the transcripts using the primer set . in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ amplification products were not detected using either the or primer set . these results confirmed that transcripts spanning the t dna insertion site and downstream of the t dna insertion are absent in all these mutant lines . after the molecular identity of the t dna insertional mutants was established they were grown in soil under long day conditions alongside the corresponding wild type controls . under these conditions there was no visible phenotype in the mutants during the early stage of vegetative growth however in the reproductive stage _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ plants often produced shorter siliques with a lower number of seeds than the corresponding wild type whereas _PROTEIN_ had siliques with length and number of seeds similar to the wild type . this difference might be due to the _PROTEIN_ that the _PROTEIN_ mutant is in a different wild type strain background from _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . from crosses using wild type pollen as the male parent and _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ as female parents shorter siliques with lower seed set were produced whereas crosses using pollen from _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ to create crosses with wild type plants as female parent produced normal siliques with seed number similar to wild type siliques suggesting an effect of the _PROTEIN_ defect on the development of female gametophyte cells . when week old _PROTEIN_ mutants grown under short day conditions were transferred to dark conditions a dramatic phenotype became apparent . all of the homozygous mutant lines started to wilt and show signs of senescence after d of continuous darkness and were apparently dead after d of continuous darkness whereas both wild type ecotypes are still alive after d of continuous darkness and show only limited signs of senescence . to further investigate this apparent accelerated senescence in the _PROTEIN_ mutants we measured two parameters related to the function of chloroplasts chlorophyll content and photochemical efficiency _METHOD_ _METHOD_ as diagnostics for leaf senescence . during extended dark conditions chlorophyll content declined more rapidly in _PROTEIN_ mutants than in the wild type and the decline of chlorophyll content was accompanied by a _PROTEIN_ in the photochemical efficiency of photosystem ii . this result indicates that the process of senescence is more rapid in _PROTEIN_ mutants than wild type plants during extended dark conditions . in order to confirm that the phenotypes of the mutant plants were caused by mutations in _PROTEIN_ a camv promoter driven _PROTEIN_ open reading frame was introduced into the _PROTEIN_ mutant _PROTEIN_ and shown to completely reverse the partial sterility and prevent the accelerated senescence phenotype observed in the _PROTEIN_ mutant line . in mammals defects in _PROTEIN_ result in a functional deficiency of mitochondrial flavoprotein dehydrogenases and accumulation of their substrates . to gain further insight into the role of the _PROTEIN_ protein in arabidopsis we used the method of citation to analyze changes in acyl coas in the wild type and _PROTEIN_ mutants during the extended dark treatment . the results shown in figure demonstrate a dramatic increase in the amount of five _PROTEIN_ acyl coa in the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants compared with the wild type during the extended dark period . there were four candidates in arabidopsis for the five _PROTEIN_ acyl coa compounds isovaleryl coa methyl butyryl coa valeryl coa and acetoacetyl coa . however the retention time of synthetic acetoacetyl etheno coa was earlier than the five _PROTEIN_ acyl coa peak eliminating acetoacetyl coa as a candidate for the peak . furthermore given the improved resolution among peaks in the short chain acyl coa region by hplc using the hypercarb porous graphitic _PROTEIN_ column we could successfully discriminate this five _PROTEIN_ acyl coa peak from valeryl coa and methyl butyryl coa and identified this peak as isovaleryl coa . isovaleryl coa is an intermediate of the leu catabolic pathway being subsequently dehydrogenated to methylcrotonyl coa by isovaleryl coa dehydrogenase . in animals etf is the physiological electron acceptor of isovaleryl coa dehydrogenase . these results suggest a similar interaction of isovaleryl coa dehydrogenase etf and _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis . acyl coa profiles from both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants from the and d extended dark treatments also showed dramatically increased content of a compound that had the same _METHOD_ as the straight chain eicosanoyl coa but which had a different retention time from the coa peak in the standard mixture . the retention time of this unknown acyl coa peak from the _PROTEIN_ mutant was identical to synthetic phytanoyl coa and both shared the same molecular _METHOD_ and diagnostic acyl coa specific fragmentation pattern when analyzed by liquid chromatography _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . unfortunately lc _METHOD_ fragmentation did not provide any information on the branching pattern of the acyl chain and so could not distinguish coa from phytanoyl coa . therefore in order to further confirm the identity of this unknown peak it was purified in bulk transmethylated and analyzed by gas chromatography _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . the _METHOD_ spectrum of the transmethylated peak was distinguishable from that of eicosanoic acid methyl ester but matched well with that of phytanic acid methyl ester which displayed an electron impact fragmentation spectrum expected for methyl branched acyl chains . from these results the accumulated unknown peak near acyl coa was unequivocally identified as phytanoyl coa . during extended dark treatment _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants contained dramatically increased concentrations of phytanoyl coa relative to the wild type . however analysis of leaf lipid fatty acids by gc showed no measurable increase in phytanic acid during the extended dark treatment . in humans phytanoyl coa is a known breakdown product of phytol the hydrophobic tail of chlorophylls a and b . that said relatively little is currently known about the exact mechanism of phytol or chlorophyll degradation in plants however our data suggest that arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ is involved in phytol degradation . further characterization of the accelerated senescence phenotype in _PROTEIN_ mutants was performed using a nonbiased gc _METHOD_ metabolic profiling protocol allowing the simultaneous determination of > compounds as was expected the extended dark treatment led to a rapid decline in sucrose and other sugar contents in both the wild type and _PROTEIN_ . most free amino acids increased significantly in both the wild type and _PROTEIN_ including leu isle val asn arg trp and phe suggesting that protein degradation was elevated under these conditions . the significantly elevated levels of several amino acids especially leu and trp in the _PROTEIN_ mutants suggest involvement of _PROTEIN_ in their degradation pathways . analysis of tricarboxy acid cycle intermediates showed a dramatic increase in succinate fumarate and malate in _PROTEIN_ at and d dark treatment . while these accumulations are striking the exact mechanism underlying this phenomenon can not be elucidated from the results in this study . there are two possible explanations for the progressive accumulation of these metabolites . first it is conceivable that the tca cycle is progressively upregulated in the mutant during the course of the extended darkness in an attempt to compensate for the reduced availability of respiratory substrate . secondly the accumulation of tca cycle intermediates may be a consequence of a general downregulation of biosynthesis that would be anticipated under conditions of _PROTEIN_ starvation . while we favor the second hypothesis further experimentation including direct measurements of fluxes within the constituent pathways will ultimately be required in order to fully comprehend these data . interestingly glu and pyroglutamic acid concentrations declined in _PROTEIN_ at to d whereas they increased in the wild type . it has been suggested in sucrose starvation experiments that amino acid catabolism is activated and supplies respiratory substrates to the tca cycle however in _PROTEIN_ one or more amino acid catabolic pathways appear to be blocked . one possible consequence of this block could be an overactivation of glu catabolism in order to compensate for the shortfall of respiratory substrate . furthermore accumulation of uracil and ribose in _PROTEIN_ in the d dark treatment suggests that rna degradation was activated in _PROTEIN_ mutants at this stage and this is most probably associated with the process of cell death . the above observations were all made by analyzing data on the basis of specific metabolites however interesting features of the data also emerge when the entire metabolite profiles are considered . while the majority of the metabolite levels in the _PROTEIN_ mutant exhibit monophasic behavior with respect to time in continuous darkness a subset of metabolites such as gln gly oxyproline pro mannose and trehalose exhibit biphasic behavior . it is tempting to speculate that monophasic responses are observed for the metabolites more intimately related to the reactions catalyzed by _PROTEIN_ while the biphasic responses are probably secondary effects arising from the extreme stress that the _PROTEIN_ mutants are under following longer periods of darkness . however further experimentation will be required to determine whether this is indeed the case . future work should also include characterization of mannose and trehalose metabolism in these lines since both of these _PROTEIN_ increase following extensive periods in continuous darkness despite initially _PROTEIN_ . it is important to note that although the data presented here were solely determined from _PROTEIN_ essentially the same results were obtained from analysis of a second mutant _PROTEIN_ .
arabidopsis thaliana seeds were surface sterilized and imbibed for d at in the dark on agar plates containing half strength murashige and skoog _METHOD_ media . seeds were subsequently germinated and grown at under long day conditions with white light . for examination of phenotype in the long day treatment seedlings were transferred to soil to d after germination and placed in a growth chamber at

light grown control from dark treated leaves and from cell suspension culture using the _PROTEIN_ reagent . cdna fragments for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ the subunit of bckdh chlorophyll a/b binding protein _PROTEIN_ and nitrate reductase _PROTEIN_ were amplified from arabidopsis cdna by pcr . rna was fractionated by electrophoresis on agarose gels blotted onto positively charged nylon _LOCATION_ and hybridized at with the appropriate cdna probes labeled with dctp using the megaprime kit . the hybridized _LOCATION_ was washed for h in a solution containing ssc and _PROTEIN_ at followed by two washes with ssc and _PROTEIN_ at for h. the three mutant lines salk t dna line _PROTEIN_ syngenta arabidopsis insertion line _PROTEIN_ and john innes centre gene trap line _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were obtained from the nottingham arabidopsis stock centre . the mutants were isolated according to published procedures signal syngenta sail line and john innes centre gene trap line . genotypes of the different knockout mutant lines were analyzed by pcr using primers specific for the _PROTEIN_ orf _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and primers specific for the insertion elements _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . the full length orf including stop codon of _PROTEIN_ was amplified by rt pcr from wild type arabidopsis and subcloned into the vector using the gateway recombination system . heterozygous _PROTEIN_ mutant plants were subsequently transformed by agrobacterium tumefaciens mediated gene transfer utilizing the floral dip method because of the partial sterility exhibited by the homozygous _PROTEIN_ plant . positive transformants were selected on half strength _METHOD_ medium containing agar and hygromycin . homozygous _PROTEIN_ lines containing the camv promoter driven _PROTEIN_ orf were characterized by genomic pcr using the primer set and _PROTEIN_ described above in order to check the transformed _PROTEIN_ orf and the primer set and _PROTEIN_ in order to confirm that there was no amplification from a disrupted copy of _PROTEIN_ . the primer was designed on the basis of the intron sequence of _PROTEIN_ in order to eliminate amplification from the transformed _PROTEIN_ orf . total rna was isolated from rosette leaves of d dark treated plants using _PROTEIN_ reagent . first strand cdna was synthesized from of total rna with superscript ii rnase reverse transcriptase and oligo primer . pcr amplification of _PROTEIN_ cdna specific sequence was performed using primers specific for the orf and _PROTEIN_ and and described above . pcr amplification of the cdna encoding the tubulin of arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ with a forward primer _PROTEIN_ and a reverse primer served as a control . in order to generate camv promoter driven _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein constructs the bp coding region of _PROTEIN_ was amplified by rt pcr from wild type arabidopsis with primers flanked with and sites . the resultant sequence was then cloned into the entry vector by gateway recombination . this cloned sequence was then transferred from the vector to the vector by gateway recombination . wild type arabidopsis col was subsequently transformed by agrobacterium mediated gene transfer utilizing the floral dip method . positive transformants were selected on half strength _METHOD_ medium containing agar and kanamycin . following selection transformants were transferred to soil and seeds collected . the generation was used for the observation of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . five day old seedlings were harvested into a freshly made staining solution of nm cmtmros in half strength _METHOD_ medium and allowed to stain for min at room temperature . after staining the seedlings were submerged in a half strength _METHOD_ solution for min . the seedlings were visualized by confocal microscopy with a _PROTEIN_ confocal microscope set to measure an emission band of to nm for _METHOD_ and an emission band of to nm for mitotracker orange cmtmros . excitation for _METHOD_ was provided by the nm line of a mw argon laser and for mitotracker by a nm hene laser . the software lsm examiner was used for postacquisition image processing . several generation lines for each construct were investigated and all showed the same _METHOD_ pattern . for chlorophyll content mg of leaf tissue were frozen and ground in liquid nitrogen and extracted by heating in ml of methanol at for min . after clarification by centrifugation the chlorophyll concentration per fresh weight of leaf tissue was calculated as described previously . photochemical efficiency was examined at the given time points for the dark treatment using attached leaves of the wild type and _PROTEIN_ mutants . the photochemical efficiency of psii was deduced from the characteristics of chlorophyll _METHOD_ using a portable plant efficiency analyzer . the ratio of fv to fm which corresponds to the potential quantum yield of the photochemical reactions of psii was used as the measure of the photochemical efficiency of psii . ten milligram portions of leaf material were frozen in liquid nitrogen and extracted for subsequent quantitative analysis of _METHOD_ acyl etheno coa derivatives by hplc with a luna mm column using the gradient conditions described previously . the lipid portion of the acyl coa extracts was transmethylated for fatty acid analysis by gc with flame ionization detection . commercially available phytanic acid was used to synthesize phytanic acid methyl ester by acidic transmethylation . phytanoyl coa for use as an hplc retention time standard was enzymatically synthesized from phytanic acid using pseudomonas acyl coa synthetase from sigma aldrich . putative phytanoyl coa peaks from hplc runs of synthetic and leaf extracts were further characterized by lc _METHOD_ to determine molecular weight and verify acyl coa specific fragmentation patterns . additional confirmation of phytanoyl coa identity was obtained by gc _METHOD_ analysis of collected hplc fractions transmethylated to their fatty acid methyl esters . putative phytanoyl coa fractions from fold concentrated and derivatized extracts run on the hplc were collected dried under vacuum and transmethylated with m sodium methoxide for h at . the formed methyl ester was partitioned against ml kcl and removed in hexane . the hexane phase was dried under vacuum and reconstituted in fresh hexane and a aliquot was analyzed by gc _METHOD_ as described previously with the exception that a m mm i.d . film _PROTEIN_ capillary column was used . short branched chain acyl coa esters were commercially unavailable and pseudomonas acyl coa synthetase was unable to catalyze the formation of short branched chain acyl coa esters from branched chain _PROTEIN_ acids . instead these were synthesized by the _PROTEIN_ method . the acyl coa products were derivatized to their etheno derivatives and characterized by lc _METHOD_ . in order to increase the resolution between the isomers a hypercarb mm porous graphitic _PROTEIN_ column was used in place of the luna mm column using the same gradient program . metabolite analysis by gc _METHOD_ was performed by a method modified from that described by citation . arabidopsis leaf tissue was homogenized using a mortar and pestle precooled with liquid nitrogen and extracted in of methanol and of internal standard was subsequently added as a quantification standard . the extraction derivatization standard addition and sample injection were exactly as described previously . the gc _METHOD_
