plant _LOCATION_ play critical roles in development growth and stress responses . in mature cells _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ display several types of structures which are formed by invagination and folding of _METHOD_ into the lumenal side and can gradually move and change shape . although such vm structures are observed in a broad range of tissue types and plant species the molecular mechanism underlying their formation and _PROTEIN_ remains unclear . here we report that a novel heat repeat protein shoot _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ of arabidopsis is involved in the control of morphological changes and dynamics of vm structures in endodermal cells which are the gravity sensing cells in shoots . _PROTEIN_ is a _LOCATION_ associated protein that is _PROTEIN_ localized to the vm in stem endodermal cells . the mutant stem exhibits a reduced gravitropic response . higher plants utilize amyloplast sedimentation as a means to sense gravity direction . amyloplasts are surrounded by _METHOD_ in arabidopsis endodermal cells and the flexible and dynamic structure of _METHOD_ is important for amyloplast sedimentation . we demonstrated that such dynamic features of _METHOD_ are gradually lost in endodermal cells during a min observation period . histological analysis revealed that amyloplast sedimentation was impaired in . detailed live cell imaging analyses revealed that the vm structures in had severe defects in morphological changes and dynamics . our results suggest that _PROTEIN_ is a novel protein involved in the formation and/or _PROTEIN_ of invaginated vm structures in gravity sensing cells .
the mutant has no obvious morphological abnormalities except for _PROTEIN_ shoots that elongate horizontally . when the inflorescence stem of the wt is gravity stimulated by placing it horizontally the stem bends upward within min . in contrast the stem requires min to bend indicating that the mutant stem exhibits a slower gravitropic response than the wt stem . because the gravitropic response requires organ growth we next examined stem growth . the stem grew as well as the wt stem indicating that the gravitropic phenotype is not caused by a growth defect . it has been reported that the mutant has no significant phenotype for root and hypocotyl gravitropism . in addition the stem and hypocotyl show the same bending pattern as the wt stem and hypocotyl in response to unilateral light suggesting that has the ability to grow asymmetrically . fig . of the shoot gravitropism mutant . six week old plants of the wild type and . scale bar cm . gravitropic phenotype of the wild type and .

had a g to tt substitution at the junction of the second intron and the third exon causing a frameshift and a stop codon at asparagine . had a single c to t substitution resulting in a nonsense mutation at glutamine . had an _PROTEIN_ to cc substitution that caused a frameshift at serine resulting in substitutions of eight amino acids and a stop codon . immunoblot analysis revealed that the _PROTEIN_ protein was not detected in or suggesting that and are null alleles . in contrast produced a truncated form of _PROTEIN_ as predicted by its molecular lesion . the greatly reduced amount of protein in suggested that the mutation may have affected the protein stability or protein synthesis efficiency . the gravitropic response was comparable with that of suggesting that is also a loss of function mutation . taken together these results demonstrate that _PROTEIN_ is . is a single gene in the arabidopsis genome that encodes a protein of amino acids with no functional or structural domain except for heat repeats . as a result of a blast search _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ homologous genes were found in genomes of several animals and plants however no homolog was found in yeast . northern blot analysis suggested that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in roots hypocotyls and _METHOD_ was higher than that in other organs . moreover reverse transcription pcr analysis using total rna derived from various organs of wt plants suggested that _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ in all organs examined although the _PROTEIN_ levels varied . transgenic plants that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ under the control of the _PROTEIN_ promoter were generated to investigate the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ pattern at the tissue level . the _PROTEIN_ promoter showed strong activity in the root cap of primary roots the vascular tissues of roots hypocotyls and cotyledons and the guard cells of cotyledons . in the stem of the transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ promoter activity was observed in the epidermis endodermis phloem developing metaxylem and interfascicular cells . because the endodermis is the major site for gravity sensing in the stem we next investigated the relationship between _PROTEIN_ in the endodermis and function of _PROTEIN_ during shoot gravitropism . two independent transgenic plants that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ under the control of the endodermis specific scarecrow _PROTEIN_ promoter exhibited a wt like gravitropic response indicating that the function of _PROTEIN_ in the endodermis is sufficient for a normal gravitropic response and that _PROTEIN_ functions in the endodermis for shoot gravitropism . endodermal cells in _METHOD_ contain a number of amyloplasts and sedimentation of amyloplasts in the direction of gravity is important for gravity sensing . first we used a histological method to evaluate amyloplast sedimentation . the stem segments were fixed with the direction of gravity _PROTEIN_ constant embedded and sectioned . an endodermal cell was partitioned into four regions for quantitative analysis and the number of amyloplasts in each region was counted for cells . almost all amyloplasts in wt endodermal cells were localized at block a the bottom side of the cell . in contrast the ratio of amyloplasts in block a of endodermal cells was significantly lower and the ratios in blocks b and c were higher than those of the wt . fig . sedimentation in

inverted the plants at an angle of to investigate amyloplast sedimentation using this method . the uppermost region in the endodermal cells of inverted plants was a while the lowermost region was d. after inversion the _METHOD_ were immediately cut and fixed with the new gravity direction _PROTEIN_ constant . amyloplasts were almost equally localized over four blocks in the endodermal cells of inverted wt _METHOD_ . following this the _METHOD_ were incubated for or min in the dark after inversion cut and fixed . the ratios of block a b and c gradually _PROTEIN_ in the wt as the incubation time increased whereas the ratio of block d increased . in contrast the ratio of each block in did not change dramatically as seen in the wt . this result suggests that _PROTEIN_ is involved in amyloplast sedimentation in the direction of gravity . according to sosui _PROTEIN_ is predicted to have no transmembrane domain . moreover _PROTEIN_ has no signal sequence and would not enter the lumenal side of organelles . a fractionation experiment revealed that most _PROTEIN_ existed in the _LOCATION_ fraction . we next examined the _PROTEIN_ solubilization conditions . we found that _PROTEIN_ was not solubilized in high salt urea or alkaline buffer at room temperature . however part of _PROTEIN_ was solubilized by triton x or _PROTEIN_ at room temperature . these results suggest the possibility that _PROTEIN_ is rigidly associated with the _LOCATION_ . fig . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ localized to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . subfractionation by ultracentrifugation .

_PROTEIN_ . the _METHOD_ signal was spotty along the periphery of the cells and circular within the cells . moreover relatively large dot like signals occasionally emerged during the observations . because chl _METHOD_ from amyloplasts was detected outside the peripheral _METHOD_ signal _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ did not seem to exist on the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . moreover it was difficult to determine whether _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ existed near the amyloplasts owing to chl _METHOD_ from amyloplasts . we crossed _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ with several transgenic plants as follows _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ /wt _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ and generated plants that harbored homozygous _METHOD_ of the transgenes and the mutation . we first observed the endodermal cells of a plant derived from a cross between _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ signals along the cell periphery overlapped with those of monomeric red _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . moreover the _METHOD_ signal within the cells merged with the invaginated structure of vm . therefore the circular form of the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ signal shown in supplementary fig . was thought to exist along the invaginated structure of the vm . the endodermal cell shown in supplementary fig . is s after the cell in b . a large dot like _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signal was observed in the cell and merged with the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signal . the _LOCATION_ exists adjacent to the vm in mature plant cells . we next observed the endodermal cells of plants derived from a cross between _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _LOCATION_ . peripheral and circular _METHOD_ signals were observed in the endodermal cells however the signals did not merge with the _METHOD_ signal from the _LOCATION_ . the _PROTEIN_ signal that merged with that of _PROTEIN_ exists not only with the vm but also with the pvc _PROTEIN_ . to examine whether the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ dot like signal was localized to the pvc we observed endodermal cells of plants derived from a cross between _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . however the dot like signal did not merge with such an organelle marker . these results suggest that _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ localized to the vm . based on the localization to the vm we assumed that _PROTEIN_ is involved in amyloplast sedimentation through modulating the vm function . consistently genetic analyses of several sgr mutants and zig suppressor mutants have revealed that flexible vm structures are important for amyloplast sedimentation _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . we next observed the endodermis of a transgenic plant that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ tonoplast intrinsic protein _PROTEIN_ a marker for lytic _LOCATION_ under control of the _PROTEIN_ promoter _PROTEIN_ . a longitudinally cut stem segment was allowed to stand for min on a vertical stage and observations of each sample were finished within the next min . two types of endodermal cells were observed in both genotypes at a time point within min after stem cutting i.e . cells with invaginated vm structures and moving amyloplasts and those with simple vm structures and static amyloplasts . _METHOD_ in approximately of wt endodermal cells showed invaginated structures whereas they were observed in only of endodermal cells at the same time point . amyloplasts rarely moved in the endodermal cells of both genotypes with no invaginated vm structures . approximately of endodermal cells harbored mobility less _LOCATION_ and amyloplasts and such a status of the _LOCATION_ and amyloplasts lasted until min after cutting the stem . following this we focused on the endodermal cells containing invaginated vm structures and amyloplasts during a min time window within min after cutting the stem . subsequently the samples were held on the vertical stage and observed during a min time window within min after cutting the _METHOD_ . the ratio of mobile amyloplasts per cell at min after cutting the wt stem _PROTEIN_ significantly compared with that at min after cutting . however all endodermal cells _PROTEIN_ invaginated vm structures in the wt stem . in contrast the ratio of mobile amyloplasts per cell in _PROTEIN_ drastically and approximately of endodermal cells lost invaginated vm structures min after stem cutting indicating that vm structure in is sensitive to the sample preparation process including stem cutting . fig . _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ structures and amyloplast dynamics in endodermal cells of cut _METHOD_ . the endodermal

observe the change in vm structures over time in more detail the endodermal cells containing invaginated vm structures were placed horizontally and observed by spinning disk confocal microscopy . the imaging of endodermal cells min after cutting the stem showed that several vm structures were newly formed within the lumen and changed shape . invaginated vm structures were emerged and changed shape one after another during the observations . in contrast vm structures were quite different from those of the wt i.e multiple layers of _METHOD_ were juxtaposed to each other . vm structures and amyloplasts seemed gradually to lose their flexibility and mobility during the observation in . moreover vm structures with less motility gradually changed into numerous vesicular like vm structures min after cutting the stem whereas wild type vm structures min after cutting the stem differ little from those min after cutting . these results indicate that affects the proper formation and morphological changes in vm structures and causes aberrant vesicular like vm structures . taken together we conclude that _PROTEIN_ may act on formation and/or _PROTEIN_ of invaginated vm structures and indirectly modulates amyloplast dynamics in endodermal cells . fig . dimensional imaging of _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ structures in endodermal cells . the endodermal cells of the transgenic plant

the col or ler accessions of a. thaliana heynh . were used as the wt . and were isolated from an population of col seeds mutagenized with ethyl methanesulfonate _METHOD_ and rays respectively . and were isolated from an population of ler seeds mutagenized with _METHOD_ and rays respectively . seeds were sterilized with sodium hypochlorite solution and then plated on murashige skoog plates at for d. seedlings were transplanted and grown on soil under constant white light at . intact week old plants whose primary inflorescence _METHOD_ were cm in length were horizontally placed under non directional dim light at to examine the gravitropic response of the _METHOD_ . photographs were taken at the indicated times . the stem curvature was measured on digital images using imagej as the angle formed between the growing direction of the apex and the horizontal baseline . we first isolated progeny from a cross between ler and which contained a homologous mutation and exhibited an obvious phenotype . dna was prepared from approximately progeny and _PROTEIN_ was localized to chromosome ii . we prepared cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence markers that recognized _METHOD_ between col and ler for fine scale mapping based on the information provided by the arabidopsis information resource . a kb genomic dna fragment of the putative promoter region was amplified by pcr _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and cloned into pcr bluntii topo for complementation analysis . total rna was isolated from inflorescence _METHOD_ using the rneasy plant mini kit . cdnas were synthesized using superscript ii reverse transcriptase . _PROTEIN_ cdna was amplified by pcr using the synthesized cdnas as templates and then cloned into the xbai smai site in the multicloning site . _METHOD_ was fused at the n terminus of _PROTEIN_ cdna on . the resulting _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fragment was cut and inserted into the sali smai site downstream of the putative promoter or the _PROTEIN_ promoter that was already subcloned into hindiii in the multicloning site of the pbi binary vector _PROTEIN_ . the putative promoter fragment was amplified by pcr _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and inserted into the sali bamhi site upstream of uida in for _PROTEIN_ pattern analysis _PROTEIN_ . the dna sequence of each construct was confirmed by sequencing . the resulting constructs were transformed into agrobacterium tumefaciens strain and then introduced into col or plants using the floral dip method . plants were selected for resistance against kanamycin . the primer sequences used are indicated in supplementary table . tissues were fixed in ice cold acetone for min and incubated in gus staining solution _PROTEIN_ for h at to detect gus activity in the transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ described above . after rinsing in ethanol for min the tissues were cleared with a chloral hydrate glycerol water solution and observed for gus staining under a light microscope . gus stained inflorescence _METHOD_ were dehydrated in a graded ethanol series embedded in technovit and sectioned with a microtome for histological analyses . stem segments were fixed embedded in and sectioned as described previously to analyze amyloplast localization _PROTEIN_ . the plants were inverted at an angle of and incubated for or min under non directional dim light at to evaluate amyloplast sedimentation . following this the _METHOD_ were cut and fixed with the direction of gravity _PROTEIN_ constant . the subsequent procedure was the same as that described above . inflorescence stem segments were excised from week old plants and sectioned longitudinally and manually . _METHOD_ imaging of vm structures in endodermal cells with the direction of gravity _PROTEIN_ constant was performed as described previously _PROTEIN_ using a vertical stage confocal microscope equipped with an oil immersion objective . confocal images were taken at approximately s intervals for min and converted into a movie . _PROTEIN_ images were obtained for subcellular localization analysis of _PROTEIN_ . _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was detected with and nm spectral settings respectively following or nm excitation . we used an all in one type confocal laser scanning microscope system which includes a spinning disk type scanner and electron multiplying ccd for imaging of vm structures in endodermal cells . _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and chl _METHOD_ were detected with and nm spectral settings respectively following nm excitation . twenty images of wt cells along the z axis were obtained for s and imaging was repeated times . twenty five images of cells along the z axis were obtained for s and imaging was repeated times . the and images at each time point were combined and the series of and images were converted into and movies respectively using imagej .
