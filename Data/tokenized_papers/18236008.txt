squalene synthase catalyzes the condensation of two molecules of farnesyl diphosphate _METHOD_ to produce squalene the first committed precursor for sterol brassinosteroid and triterpene biosynthesis . arabidopsis thaliana contains two sqs annotated genomic sequences _GENE_ _PROTEIN_ and _GENE_ _PROTEIN_ organized in a tandem array . here we report that the _PROTEIN_ gene is widely _PROTEIN_ in all tissues throughout plant development whereas _PROTEIN_ is primarily _PROTEIN_ in the vascular tissue of leaf and cotyledon petioles and the hypocotyl of seedlings . neither the complete a. thaliana _PROTEIN_ protein nor the chimeric sqs resulting from the replacement of the c terminal residues of _PROTEIN_ by the c terminal residues of the schizosaccharomyces pombe sqs were able to confer _LOCATION_ prototrophy to a saccharomyces cerevisiae _LOCATION_ mutant strain lacking sqs activity . a soluble form of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in escherichia coli and purified was unable to synthesize sq from _METHOD_ in the presence of nadph and either or . these results demonstrated that _PROTEIN_ has no sqs activity so that _PROTEIN_ is the only functional sqs in a. thaliana . mutational studies revealed that the lack of sqs activity of _PROTEIN_ can not be exclusively attributed to the presence of an unusual ser replacing the highly conserved phe at position . _PROTEIN_ of green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ tagged versions of _PROTEIN_ in onion epidermal cells demonstrated that _PROTEIN_ is targeted to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and that this location is exclusively dependent on the presence of the _PROTEIN_ c terminal hydrophobic trans _LOCATION_ domain .
as a first approach to analyze the pattern of _PROTEIN_ driven by the a. thaliana _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ promoters we defined the regions of these promoters containing elements that are important for transcriptional activity . this was carried out by transient _PROTEIN_ of different _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ promoter gus chimeric genes in a. thaliana protoplasts and gus activity measurements in the corresponding protein extracts . the full length promoter sizes were set at positions and with respect to the _PROTEIN_ start codon of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ respectively and a series of deletions was prepared for each promoter as well . the end of each _PROTEIN_ promoter fragment ended at the _PROTEIN_ start codon of the gene and was fused with the _PROTEIN_ start codon of the gus reporter gene whereas the region of each _PROTEIN_ promoter fragment contained the sequence coding for the first amino acids of _PROTEIN_ which was fused in frame with the _PROTEIN_ start codon of the gus coding sequence . results shown in fig . indicated that the _PROTEIN_ promoter region extending from positions to contains sequences whose deletion has a profound effect on promoter activity either inhibitory or stimulatory . further deletion of the promoter to position restored full transcriptional activity . from these results and to rule out the possibility that sequences between positions and might have an effect on the qualitative _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ promoter the _PROTEIN_ gus construct including the bp upstream the _PROTEIN_ codon was selected for introduction into a. thaliana plants . as for the _PROTEIN_ promoter _PROTEIN_ analysis results indicated that the bp sequence upstream the _PROTEIN_ start codon is the minimal promoter length to establish maximal transcriptional activity in the protoplast system as nested deletions of this fragment led to a progressive reduction of activity which was completely abolished when the promoter was shortened to position . therefore the _PROTEIN_ gus construct including the bp sequence upstream the _PROTEIN_ codon was selected to analyze the pattern of _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in transgenic a. thaliana plants . the selected _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ promoter gus chimeric genes were introduced into a. thaliana by agrobacterium mediated transformation and the _PROTEIN_ of gus activity was analyzed by histochemical staining . as shown in fig . the _PROTEIN_ promoter directs a widespread _PROTEIN_ of gus activity which was detected from the very early stages of seedling development . gus activity was strongly _PROTEIN_ in roots of both seedlings and adult plants and was also evident in cotyledons and leaves particularly in the vascular tissue and the petioles . _PROTEIN_ of gus activity in leaves progressively _PROTEIN_ as they become older . an intense _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ gus was also observed in floral organs and siliques being the highest levels of gus activity detected in pollen grains . in contrast transgenic plants harbouring _PROTEIN_ gus exhibited a specialized pattern of gus _PROTEIN_ which was primarily detected in the vascular tissue of leaf and cotyledon petioles and the hypocotyl of one week old seedlings . a faint gus staining was also visible in _METHOD_ whereas no apparent _PROTEIN_ of gus activity was detected in germinating seeds roots floral organs and siliques . the _PROTEIN_ patterns deduced from the sqs promoter gus gene _PROTEIN_ analyses are in agreement with the genevestigator microarray _PROTEIN_ data for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . sqs proteins contain three conserved regions that are involved in catalysis and specific amino acid residues within these domains are reported to be essential for the two half reactions catalyzed by the enzyme . these residues are also present in the corresponding domains of a. thaliana _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ with the only exception of _PROTEIN_ which is found in _PROTEIN_ but is replaced by a ser residue in _PROTEIN_ . to assess the effect that this substitution might have on _PROTEIN_ activity we first checked the potential of _PROTEIN_ to rescue the _LOCATION_ auxotrophy of a s. cerevisiae _LOCATION_ mutant strain that is deficient in sqs activity . to this end plasmids _PROTEIN_ the complete _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and a chimeric a. thaliana _PROTEIN_ . pombe sqs protein in which the c terminal residues of a. thaliana _PROTEIN_ were replaced by the c terminal residues of the s. pombe sqs _PROTEIN_ were assayed for their ability to restore growth of strain on media not supplemented with _LOCATION_ . as a positive control of complementation of the _LOCATION_ mutation we used plasmid _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ an equivalent a. thaliana _PROTEIN_ . pombe sqs chimera as it has been previously demonstrated that _PROTEIN_ of the complete a. thaliana _PROTEIN_ is unable to complement the _LOCATION_ mutation . interestingly neither _PROTEIN_ nor _PROTEIN_ were able to confer _LOCATION_ prototrophy to strain thereby indicating that a. thaliana _PROTEIN_ can not substitute for the yeast endogenous sqs . to confirm that the protein encoded by the _PROTEIN_ gene is a non functional sqs we _PROTEIN_ in e. coli his tagged versions of both a. thaliana sqs proteins in which the predicted hydrophobic trans _LOCATION_ sequence and c terminal residues was replaced by a sequence of amino acids followed by a tag of histidines . the resulting soluble extracts were assayed for sqs activity using _METHOD_ nadph and as a cofactor and the reaction products were analyzed by normal phase tlc . as shown in fig . sq formation was detected only in extracts from cells _PROTEIN_ the recombinant _PROTEIN_ whereas no sq formation was detected neither in extracts from cells _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ nor in extracts from cells harbouring the empty _PROTEIN_ vector . these results confirmed that the protein encoded by the _PROTEIN_ gene actually has no sqs activity . to assess the contribution of the _PROTEIN_ to ser substitution to the loss of activity of _PROTEIN_ we also constructed and _PROTEIN_ in e. coli mutated versions of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in which _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ was replaced by a ser residue _PROTEIN_ and conversely of _PROTEIN_ was replaced by phe _PROTEIN_ . the resulting mutants together with the non mutated sqs _METHOD_ were purified from e. coli soluble extracts using ni agarose affinity chromatography . highly purified protein preparations were obtained as shown by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and western blot analysis using anti sqs antibodies . the purified recombinant enzymes were assayed for sqs activity in a mixture containing _METHOD_ nadph and either or as a cofactor and the reaction products were analyzed by reverse phase tlc . as expected _PROTEIN_ catalyzed the synthesis of sq from _METHOD_ in the presence of nadph and either mg or mn . interestingly replacement of _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ with ser _PROTEIN_ caused a drastic but not complete loss of sqs activity . the calculated specific activity of the purified _PROTEIN_ preparation was nmol/min/mg whereas that of _PROTEIN_ was nmol/min/mg which is less than the activity of _PROTEIN_ . in full agreement with the results shown in fig . _PROTEIN_ was unable to produce sq . instead the enzyme generated two major labelled products whether nadph was present or not in the reaction which co migrated with the products synthesized by _PROTEIN_ when nadph was omitted in the reaction mixture . these compounds might be dehydrosqualene and hydroxysqualene _PROTEIN_ the major triterpene products suggested to derive from _PROTEIN_ the product of the first half reaction catalyzed by sqs . the same profile of reaction products was obtained when _PROTEIN_ was assayed for sqs activity which indicated that the mutant enzyme was unable to produce sq from _METHOD_ in the presence of nadph . this result led us to conclude that the loss of sqs activity can not be exclusively attributed to the mutation of _PROTEIN_ to ser because re introduction of phe at this position did not restore sqs activity . taken together our results demonstrated that _PROTEIN_ is the only functional sqs in a. thaliana . the analysis of the hydropathy plot of a. thaliana _PROTEIN_ showed that the enzyme contains a c terminal highly hydrophobic sequence which has been suggested to anchor the enzyme into the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and a second less hydrophobic sequence extending from residues to . to investigate the intracellular location of _PROTEIN_ an n terminal _METHOD_ tagged version of _PROTEIN_ and an _LOCATION_ targeted variant of were transiently co _PROTEIN_ in onion epidermal cells . confocal laser microscopy analysis of the transfected cells revealed a reticular pattern of green _METHOD_ identical to that of red _METHOD_ emitted by the protein . superimposed images of _METHOD_ and derived _METHOD_ confirmed that both proteins co localize thus demonstrating that _PROTEIN_ is targeted to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . we next investigated the intracellular location of a fusion between _METHOD_ and the c terminal residues of _PROTEIN_ including the predicted trans _LOCATION_ domain _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and a fusion between _METHOD_ and a truncated _PROTEIN_ lacking the last residues _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . co _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ with revealed that both proteins co localized to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . in contrast cells _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ displayed uniformly distributed green _METHOD_ throughout the cytoplasm . this pattern of _METHOD_ was identical to that obtained with untargeted _METHOD_ with the exception of the accumulation of _METHOD_ in the nucleoplasm which was not observed in cells _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . overall these results conclusively demonstrated that _PROTEIN_ is targeted to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and moreover that this intracellular location is exclusively dependent on the presence of the predicted c terminal trans _LOCATION_ domain .
