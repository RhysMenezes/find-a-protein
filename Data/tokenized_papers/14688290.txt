the nadph dependent protochlorophyllide oxidoreductase _PROTEIN_ is unique because it is a photoenzyme that requires light for its catalytic activity and uses pchlide itself as a photoreceptor . in arabidopsis there are three structurally related _PROTEIN_ denoted _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . the import of one of them _PROTEIN_ into _LOCATION_ of cotyledons is substrate dependent . this substrate dependence is demonstrated in intact seedlings of wild type arabidopsis and two mutants which is devoid of pchlide and flu which upon redarkening rapidly accumulates pchlide . in true leaves _PROTEIN_ uptake does not require the presence of pchlide . the organ specificity of the substrate dependent import of _PROTEIN_ reveals a means of controlling _LOCATION_ protein translocation that is closely associated with a key step in plant development the light dependent transformation of cotyledons from a storage organ to a photosynthetically active leaf .
the mode of import of _PROTEIN_ was studied in intact transgenic arabidopsis plants _PROTEIN_ the precursor of _PROTEIN_ fused to green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ . as controls plants _PROTEIN_ fusions of precursors of _PROTEIN_ or the small subunit of ribulose bisphosphate _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ with _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ alone without a _LOCATION_ signal sequence attached to it were analyzed . the intracellular distribution of the various reporter proteins was first determined in protoplasts isolated from light _PROTEIN_ green transgenic seedlings . _METHOD_ and chlorophyll as a marker for the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ system of chloroplasts were detected with the confocal microscope by their bright green and red _METHOD_ respectively . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was not detectable in _LOCATION_ of light grown seedlings whereas the other reporter proteins were present . merging of the _METHOD_ and chlorophyll _METHOD_ images confirmed the expected localization of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was integrated into _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ accumulated within the stroma of _LOCATION_ . native _METHOD_ was excluded from the _LOCATION_ and accumulated in the surrounding cytoplasm . similar results were obtained with intact cotyledons . however in contrast to light grown seedlings in etiolated plants not only _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ but also _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ accumulated within the _LOCATION_ . the apparent absence of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ from _LOCATION_ of light grown seedlings of transgenic plants did not seem to be attributable to an effect on the accumulation of the mrnas . specific primer sequences were used to determine the amounts of transcripts of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgenes in light grown seedlings by quantitative pcr . as shown in figure high transcript levels were found in these seedlings _PROTEIN_ of whether they _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgenes whereas in wild type control plants these transcripts were not detectable . pigments such as pchlide and chlorophyll have been reported previously to influence the translocation of _LOCATION_ proteins . etioplasts accumulate higher levels of pchlide whereas in chloroplasts the pchlide concentration _PROTEIN_ beyond the level of detection therefore we suspected that these differences in pchlide concentration could have contributed to the presence or absence of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in _LOCATION_ of intact etiolated and light grown arabidopsis seedlings respectively . the biosynthesis of chlorophyll in higher plants relies exclusively on the strictly light dependent reduction of the immediate precursor of chlorophyll pchlide to chlorophyllide . in the dark stable pchlide nadph _PROTEIN_ ternary complexes are formed such that absorption of light by the pigment itself leads to its immediate reduction . the pigment fraction bound to the _PROTEIN_ active site in these ternary complexes thus is termed photoactive. the accumulation of additional nonphotoactive pchlide potentially a lethal sensitizer for photoactive damage upon illumination normally is prevented by negative feedback control of glu trna reductase the first enzyme committed exclusively to tetrapyrrole biosynthesis . various mutants have been described in which different enzymatic and regulatory steps within this pathway are blocked . two of these mutants of arabidopsis and flu were used in the present study to modulate the endogenous level of pchlide noninvasively and thus test its possible involvement in regulating the import of _PROTEIN_ into _LOCATION_ of intact seedlings . the mutant is unable to form protoporphyrin ix from protoporphyrin ix and thus lacks pchlide . upon supplementation with aminolevulinic acid the common precursor of all tetrapyrroles large amounts of protoix but no pchlide accumulated in etiolated seedlings of homozygous whereas in wild type seedlings treated in the same way high levels of pchlide and protoix were detected in addition to protoix . thus in contrast to other xantha mutants that have been shown to be leaky _METHOD_ to be virtually devoid of pchlide . the second mutant flu is defective in the metabolic feedback control of ala synthesis . as a result of this mutation dark grown plants no longer are able to restrict the synthesis of pchlide and thus accumulate a to fold higher amount of this pigment than do wild type plants . when transferred from the dark to the light homozygous flu mutant seedlings rapidly bleached and died . they could be rescued however by germinating the seedlings under constant light . under these light conditions pchlide was photoreduced continuously and its level remained below the level of detection similar to what has been found in light grown wild type plants . after transferring these light _PROTEIN_ seedlings to the dark however flu seedlings rapidly started to accumulate pchlide whereas wild type seedlings failed to do so . other intermediates of chlorophyll biosynthesis such as protoix protoix and protoix monomethylester were barely detectable in either wild type or mutant plants . first the various _METHOD_ fusion proteins were _PROTEIN_ stably in the mutant of arabidopsis . homozygous mutants can not survive beyond the seedling stage . therefore heterozygous mutants that show the wild type phenotype were transformed with the various _METHOD_ fusion gene constructs . the intracellular distribution of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was analyzed in etiolated seedlings chosen randomly from the segregating progeny of a transformed heterozygous mutant plant and that contained the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ construct . in of the seedlings selected no _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signal was detected whereas the remaining seedlings accumulated large amounts of the protein . by contrast _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were present in all of the seedlings of heterozygous plants . a similar distribution of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ also was found in light grown seedlings . the genotypes of the plants grown in the dark could be determined easily by transferring them to continuous light . seedlings of the wild type and heterozygous mutants rapidly turned green whereas cotyledons of homozygous plants retained the yellow color characteristic of etiolated seedlings . only the three plants derived from the seedlings that did not accumulate the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein in the dark turned out to be homozygous mutants . all seedlings were derived from the same parent plant and thus had the same genetic background except for the gene . hence the failure of homozygous mutants to accumulate _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ must be the result of a block in the chlorophyll biosynthesis pathway and thus may be caused by the lack of pchlide . the idea that pchlide is required for the uptake of _PROTEIN_ into _LOCATION_ was tested further in a second experiment . by using transgenic flu mutants that _PROTEIN_ the various _METHOD_ fusion proteins the effect of enhanced levels of pchlide on the accumulation of _PROTEIN_ in chloroplasts of intact green seedlings also could be analyzed in a noninvasive manner . in cotyledons of flu and wild type seedlings kept under continuous light _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ but not _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ accumulated within chloroplasts . soon after these seedlings were transferred to the dark flu started to accumulate pchlide and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ began to appear in _LOCATION_ of this mutant whereas in wild type control seedlings the fusion protein was not detected . these differences in _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ accumulation were not caused by different amounts of transcripts of the transgene in flu and wild type plants . as shown in figure similar levels of transcripts of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgenes were present in these plants . the presence or absence of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in _LOCATION_ of intact plants is closely correlated with the presence or absence of pchlide suggesting that import of the _PROTEIN_ precursor protein requires the presence of the enzyme 's substrate . however as shown previously pchlide also may have a strong impact on the stability of _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ binary and ternary complexes with pchlide and nadph that exhibit an enhanced resistance to proteolysis whereas the apoenzyme is highly susceptible to proteolytic degradation . hence the results reported to date do not exclude the possibility that pchlide may stabilize _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in the _LOCATION_ rather than allow the import of _PROTEIN_ to occur . to distinguish between these two possibilities chimeric fusion proteins were _PROTEIN_ in transgenic arabidopsis seedlings . the transit sequences of ppora and pporb were exchanged and fused reciprocally to mature _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ respectively . when the transit peptide of ppora was attached to _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ uptake of the fusion protein became dependent on pchlide so that it no longer accumulated in the chloroplasts of light grown seedlings . conversely when linked to the transit peptide of pporb _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ accumulated inside the chloroplasts of green cotyledons . thus the effect of pchlide on the appearance of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in _LOCATION_ of intact seedlings is not attributable to changes in protein stability rather it reflects the dependence of the import of this protein on the availability of pchlide . in light grown seedlings _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ not only failed to accumulate within the chloroplasts but also was not detectable outside of the _LOCATION_ in the surrounding cytoplasm . this apparent absence of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in light grown plants devoid of pchlide may indicate a rapid degradation of the nonimported precursor of _PROTEIN_ similar to the rapid turnover of other precursor proteins that had been reported previously or may be caused by the pchlide dependent control of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ mrna translation . these proposed modes of control of _PROTEIN_ biosynthesis and accumulation were tested in two different ways . first proteins were pulse labeled with met in light _PROTEIN_ transgenic arabidopsis seedlings that _PROTEIN_ either ppora _METHOD_ or chimeric _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in which the transit peptide of _PROTEIN_ had been replaced by the transit peptide of _PROTEIN_ . total protein extracts from both plant samples containing equal amounts of incorporated radioactivity were either separated directly electrophoretically or used for the immunoprecipitation of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . in plants transformed with the ppora _METHOD_ construct no radioactively labeled _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was detected whereas in plants containing the chimeric pbmpora construct accumulation of the mature protein was demonstrated by immunoprecipitation . second the association of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ mrnas with polysomes was analyzed in etiolated and light grown day old wild type seedlings and in flu seedlings of similar age that were kept under continuous light or transferred to the dark for h. as a control the levels of endogenous _PROTEIN_ mrna also were determined . upon illumination of etiolated arabidopsis seedlings the _PROTEIN_ mrna concentration declines rapidly whereas in light grown seedlings that are transferred back to the dark _PROTEIN_ mrna starts to reaccumulate . the relative concentrations of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ mrnas were determined by pcr . the levels of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ mrnas associated with polysomes were similar in all four plant samples _PROTEIN_ of whether these seedlings accumulated higher amounts of pchlide or were devoid of this pigment whereas _PROTEIN_ mrnas were found only within the polysomal fractions of etiolated seedlings and to a lesser extent of light grown flu seedlings that had been transferred back to the dark . in light grown wild type and flu seedlings these mrnas were not detectable . these results could be confirmed by real time pcr . equal amounts of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ mrnas were present within the polysomal fractions of etiolated and light grown wild type seedlings and light grown flu seedlings with or without a subsequent dark treatment . however the corresponding levels of _PROTEIN_ mrna in etiolated wild type and light grown flu seedlings returned to the dark exceeded those in light grown wild type and flu seedlings by _PROTEIN_ of and respectively . the results of these two experiments do not support the pchlide dependent control of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ mrna translation rather they suggest that in the absence of pchlide nonimported preproteins of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ are degraded rapidly . proteins that are subject to rapid degradation have been shown previously to confer this instability also upon _METHOD_ moieties fused to these proteins whereas native _METHOD_ alone _METHOD_ to be well protected against proteolytic attack . to date the substrate dependent import of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ has been shown to operate in cotyledons . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is not only negatively controlled by light but also is subject to developmental control . in contrast to young seedlings at the cotyledon stage older seedlings and chlorophyll containing organs of adult plants do not seem to _PROTEIN_ this protein . thus it was of interest to determine whether the substrate dependence of _PROTEIN_ import was _PROTEIN_ in tissues that normally would not be expected to synthesize and translocate the _PROTEIN_ precursor into chloroplasts . the distributions of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in cotyledons and primary leaves of light grown transgenic arabidopsis seedlings were compared . in control plants _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ construct both types of leaves accumulated similarly high levels of this protein . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ did not accumulate in green cotyledons whereas in primary leaves of the same plants large amounts of this protein were present in chloroplasts although pchlide levels in such leaves were below the level of detection . thus the substrate dependence of _PROTEIN_ import is subject to developmental control and is restricted to cotyledons in which this protein is _PROTEIN_ normally .
