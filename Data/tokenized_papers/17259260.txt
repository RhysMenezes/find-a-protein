plants make full use of light signals to determine the timing of flowering . in arabidopsis thaliana a blue/uv a photoreceptor cryptochrome _PROTEIN_ and a red/far red photoreceptor phytochrome b _PROTEIN_ are two major photoreceptors that control flowering . the light stimuli for the regulation of flowering are perceived by leaves . we have recently shown that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in mesophyll but not in vascular bundles suppresses the _PROTEIN_ of a key flowering regulator flowering locus t _PROTEIN_ in vascular bundles . in this study we asked where in the leaf _PROTEIN_ perceives light stimuli to regulate flowering . to answer this question we established transgenic arabidopsis lines in which the _PROTEIN_ green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ fusion was _PROTEIN_ under the control of organ/tissue specific promoters in a _PROTEIN_ deficient mutant background . analysis of these lines revealed that _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in vascular bundles but not in epidermis or mesophyll rescued the _PROTEIN_ flowering phenotype . we further confirmed that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in vascular bundles increased _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ only in vascular bundles . hence in striking contrast with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ most likely regulates _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in a cell autonomous manner .
to determine the functional site of _PROTEIN_ in leaves we established transgenic lines that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ under the control of tissue specific promoters on the _PROTEIN_ mutant background . for this purpose the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ at _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ promoters were employed . as negative controls we _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ under the control of the unusual floral organ _PROTEIN_ and the _GENE_ promoters . the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ gene was fused to these promoters and introduced into the _PROTEIN_ mutant of arabidopsis by the agrobacterium tumefaciens mediated method . as a control the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ gene was _PROTEIN_ under the control of the authentic _PROTEIN_ promoter . we established several homozygous lines for each construct . the lines with the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ at _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _GENE_ and _PROTEIN_ promoters are referred to as pcab _PROTEIN_ psuc _PROTEIN_ psultr _PROTEIN_ pml _PROTEIN_ pcer _PROTEIN_ pufo _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and pcry _PROTEIN_ lines respectively . immunoblotting analysis with an anti _METHOD_ antibody revealed that a protein of the predicted size was _PROTEIN_ in all of the lines . we first examined the _PROTEIN_ levels of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein in independent pcry _PROTEIN_ lines with an anti _PROTEIN_ antibody to choose a standard line in which _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was _PROTEIN_ at the endogenous level . seedlings of this line were then observed under a laser scanning confocal microscope . _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was observed exclusively in the _LOCATION_ as has been reported previously . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was detected in all three major organs namely cotyledons the hypocotyl and the root in pcry _PROTEIN_ . in these organs _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was _PROTEIN_ in every tissue including epidermis mesophyll cortex and vascular bundles except the root tip . in addition _PROTEIN_ in the shoot apex was detected . these results were consistent with the previously reported patterns of authentic _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . in contrast with pcry _PROTEIN_ other lines exhibited organ/tissue specific _PROTEIN_ patterns . in pcab _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was observed exclusively in the mesophyll of both cotyledons and young true leaves . semiquantitative analysis of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ indicated that the _PROTEIN_ level in pcab _PROTEIN_ mesophyll was times higher than that in pcry _PROTEIN_ mesophyll . in addition _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was _PROTEIN_ in the cortex of hypocotyl at lower levels . in psuc _PROTEIN_ and psultr _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was observed only in vascular bundles in all organs . no _PROTEIN_ was observed in the shoot apexes . semiquantitative analysis indicated that _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ levels in psuc _PROTEIN_ and psultr _PROTEIN_ in cotyledonous vascular bundles were and times higher than that in pcry _PROTEIN_ respectively . _PROTEIN_ was restricted to epidermis of the aerial part of the seedlings in pml _PROTEIN_ and pcer _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ levels in pml _PROTEIN_ and pcer _PROTEIN_ in cotyledons were and times higher respectively than in pcry _PROTEIN_ . we also confirmed that _PROTEIN_ was restricted to the shoot apex in pufo _PROTEIN_ and to the root in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . a _PROTEIN_ flowering phenotype is exhibited by _PROTEIN_ mutants under long day _PROTEIN_ conditions in the presence of _PROTEIN_ . we examined whether this phenotype was complemented in our transgenic lines . as expected full complementation was observed in pcry _PROTEIN_ . the flowering time was neither advanced nor delayed compared with the wild type . in the psuc _PROTEIN_ and psultr _PROTEIN_ lines which _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ only in vascular bundles the _PROTEIN_ flowering phenotype was also complemented . the other lines pcab _PROTEIN_ pml _PROTEIN_ pcer _PROTEIN_ pufo _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ did not complement and flowered as _PROTEIN_ as the parental _PROTEIN_ mutant . hence _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in vascular bundles but not in other tissues effectively accelerated the flowering in _PROTEIN_ . we then examined whether or not psuc _PROTEIN_ and psultr _PROTEIN_ responded normally to changes in daylength . in the short day condition flowering is not delayed in the _PROTEIN_ mutant compared with the wild type . as expected psuc _PROTEIN_ and psultr _PROTEIN_ flowered as _PROTEIN_ as pcry _PROTEIN_ and the wild type . hence _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in psuc _PROTEIN_ and psultr _PROTEIN_ did not accelerate flowering in sd . flowering times in other lines were not affected by the transgene and were the same as the control plants . the _PROTEIN_ mutant exhibits long hypocotyl phenotype under blue light . hence we checked whether this phenotype was complemented in the transgenic lines . as expected full complementation was observed in pcry _PROTEIN_ . however in contrast with the flowering phenotype none of the lines showed full complementation although partial complementation was observed in psuc _PROTEIN_ pml _PROTEIN_ and pcer _PROTEIN_ . to confirm the tissue specific _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in psuc _PROTEIN_ and psultr _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ mrna levels in isolated vascular bundles and mesophyll protoplasts were quantified by rt pcr . mesophyll cells and vascular bundles were isolated from cotyledons as described . we confirmed the purity of the samples by checking the _PROTEIN_ levels of marker genes sultr and rbcs . consistent with microscopic observation the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ mrna levels in mesophyll cells were much higher in pcry _PROTEIN_ and pcab _PROTEIN_ than in other lines . consistent with the semiquantification of the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ the level was higher in pcab _PROTEIN_ than in pcry _PROTEIN_ . conversely the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ mrna was detected in vascular bundles in psuc _PROTEIN_ psultr _PROTEIN_ and pcry _PROTEIN_ . the levels were much lower in other lines except pcab _PROTEIN_ . this might be due to the contamination of the vascular bundle samples with mesophyll cells . it should be noted that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in pcab _PROTEIN_ failed to affect flowering _PROTEIN_ of the high _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ mrna _PROTEIN_ in the mesophyll _PROTEIN_ . to examine quantitative relationships between _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in vascular bundles and flowering times we examined several independent psuc _PROTEIN_ psultr _PROTEIN_ and pcry _PROTEIN_ lines under _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ levels of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ mrna in vascular bundles were determined by rt pcr and plotted against flowering times . the _PROTEIN_ level and the flowering time correlated well . all points were laid on a single curve containing the point for the wild type plant . flowering was advanced depending on the _PROTEIN_ levels of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ up to about the endogenous level . the response was then more or less saturated . these results further supported that the flowering time was dependent on the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in vascular bundles but not in other tissues . _PROTEIN_ advances flowering by inducing the _PROTEIN_ of a key flowering regulator _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in the wild type exhibits diurnal oscillation in _PROTEIN_ . therefore to confirm that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in vascular bundles regulated flowering by increasing _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ we monitored the levels of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ during a h period on day in pcry _PROTEIN_ pcab _PROTEIN_ and psuc _PROTEIN_ . total mrna was extracted from cotyledons every h and subjected to rt pcr analysis . the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ patterns in pcry _PROTEIN_ and psuc _PROTEIN_ were almost identical to that in the wild type . the _PROTEIN_ peaked at the end of the light period in these lines . hence the effects of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in vascular bundles were indistinguishable from those of the endogenous _PROTEIN_ . by contrast the levels of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ remained low in pcab _PROTEIN_ and the _PROTEIN_ mutant . these results were fully consistent with the flowering phenotype . it has been shown that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is restricted to vascular bundles in either the presence or absence of _PROTEIN_ . we examined whether this was true in psuc _PROTEIN_ and psultr _PROTEIN_ . mesophyll cells and vascular bundles were isolated from cotyledons of d old seedlings and examined for _PROTEIN_ mrna _PROTEIN_ by rt pcr . as expected induction of _PROTEIN_ mrna _PROTEIN_ was observed only in vascular bundles . although _METHOD_ was _PROTEIN_ at a high level in mesophyll in pcab _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ induction was not observed in either mesophyll or in vascular bundles in this line .
