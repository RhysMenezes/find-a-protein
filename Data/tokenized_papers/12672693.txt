cold temperatures trigger the _PROTEIN_ of the cbf family of transcription _PROTEIN_ which in turn activate many downstream genes that confer _PROTEIN_ and freezing tolerance to plants . we report here the identification of _PROTEIN_ an upstream transcription _PROTEIN_ that regulates the transcription of cbfgenes in the cold . an arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ mutant was isolated in a screen for mutations that impair cold induced transcription of promoter luciferase reporter gene . the _PROTEIN_ blocks the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ of many genes downstream of cbfs which leads to a significant reduction in plant _PROTEIN_ and freezing encodes a myc like bhlh transcriptional activator . _PROTEIN_ binds specifically to the myc recognition sequences in the _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ constitutively and its overexpression in wild type plants enhances the _PROTEIN_ of thecbf regulon in the cold and improves freezing tolerance of the transgenic plants .
as noted above arabidopsis plants containing luc transgene emitted bioluminescence in response to cold stress . the homozygous _PROTEIN_ luc plants were mutagenized by ethylmethane sulfonate and the resulting population was screened for mutants with aberrant bioluminescence responses under cold stress using a low light imaging system . several mutants showing abnormal cold regulation of _PROTEIN_ luc _PROTEIN_ were recovered . one of these mutant lines designated as _PROTEIN_ is virtually blocked in _PROTEIN_ luc _PROTEIN_ in the cold . in response to treatment at wild type plants showed strong luminescence while the _PROTEIN_ mutant showed very little induction of luminescence throughout the duration of cold treatment . after h of cold treatment _PROTEIN_ plants showed nearly times less luminescence than that of wild type plants and are obviously defective in the cold regulation of _PROTEIN_ lucexpression . the _PROTEIN_ mutant plant was crossed with _PROTEIN_ lucwild type plants and the resulting plants were examined luc _PROTEIN_ after h of cold treatment at . as determined by luminescence imaging all plants showed reduced cold induced _PROTEIN_ luc _PROTEIN_ similar to that . an population from the selfed segregated in an ratio between mutant and wild type . these results show that _PROTEIN_ is a dominant mutation in a single _LOCATION_ gene . rna blot analysis was carried out to analyze the effect mutation on the transcript levels of endogenouscbfs and their target cold stress responsive genes . consistent with the imaging results cold induction of the gene was greatly impaired mutant plants . wild type plants induction after h of cold stress and the _PROTEIN_ peaked at h. in contrast _PROTEIN_ induction was almost abolished in _PROTEIN_ plants . while the _PROTEIN_ level in the _PROTEIN_ mutant was lower than that of wild type at and h of cold stress its induction level at and h was similar to that in the wild type . the _PROTEIN_ induction level was slightly lower in _PROTEIN_ at h of cold treatment whereas at and h the induction level was higher in the mutant . we also examined the cold induction of the downstream target genes ofcbfs . the _PROTEIN_ levels of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ under cold stress were lower than in the wild type while the induction was lower in _PROTEIN_ only after h of cold stress . consistent with these rna blot results microarray analysis using affymetrix near full genome genechips showed that out of genes induced threefold or more in the wild type by a h cold treatment are either not induced in the _PROTEIN_ mutant or their induction is or less of that in the wild type . thirty two of these encode putative transcription _PROTEIN_ suggesting that _PROTEIN_ may control many cold responsive regulons . for of the cold induced genes their induction levels in the wild type differ by less than twofold . interestingly two genes show higher levels of cold induction in mutant . at normal growth temperatures _PROTEIN_ and wild type seedlings were similar in size . although adult _PROTEIN_ plants were smaller they were not very different from the wild type in flowering time and fertility . ten day old seedlings of _PROTEIN_ and wild type grown on separate halves of the same agar plates were cold acclimated at for d and then subjected to a freezing tolerance assay . the _PROTEIN_ was less freezing tolerant than the wild type at all freezing temperatures . freezing at for h killed about of _PROTEIN_ mutant plants whereas < of wild type plants were killed at this temperature . when newly germinated _PROTEIN_ and wild type seedlings were transferred to _PROTEIN_ injury became apparent in the mutant after wk of cold treatment . after wk of _PROTEIN_ stress of wild type but only mutant plants survived . to map the _PROTEIN_ mutation a homozygous _PROTEIN_ in the _PROTEIN_ luc columbia background was crossed to wild type plants of the ler ecotype . plants from the cross were selfed to produce seeds . since the _PROTEIN_ mutation is dominant we selected from the segregating population seedlings with the wild type phenotype for mapping . a total of wild type plants were selected and used for mapping with simple sequence length polymorphism and cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence markers which initially placed _PROTEIN_ on the middle of chromosome then narrowed its location to a kb region on the and bac clones . candidate genes in this region were amplified from homozygous _PROTEIN_ mutant plants and sequenced . the sequences were compared with the published sequence ofarabidopsis ecotype columbia and a single g to a mutation in the hypothetical gene was found . to confirm that is the _PROTEIN_ gene the gene including bp upstream of the initiation codon and bp downstream of the stop codon was cloned from _PROTEIN_ mutant plants . this fragment was inserted into a binary vector and introduced into _PROTEIN_ luc columbia wild type plants byagrobacterium mediated transformation . transgenic plants were selected based on their hygromycin resistance and cold induced bioluminescence in the lines was compared with that of the wild type . the gene from _PROTEIN_ suppressed cold induced luminescence from the wild type plants and reduced the plant height to that of _PROTEIN_ mutant thus confirming that is _PROTEIN_ . the open reading frame of _PROTEIN_ was determined by sequencing cdnas obtained by reverse transcriptase pcr . _PROTEIN_ is predicted to encode a protein of amino acids with an estimated molecular _METHOD_ of kd . database searches revealed that _PROTEIN_ contains a myc like bhlh domain at its c terminal half . over the entire length of the protein _PROTEIN_ shows amino acid sequence similarity to an unknown protein of arabidopsis . the _PROTEIN_ mutation changes arg conserved in these two arabidopsis proteins to his . the bhlh domain of _PROTEIN_ shows high amino acid similarity to that of known myc related bhlh transcription _PROTEIN_ . all myc binding promoter elements contain the ca nucleotides that are contacted by a conserved glutamic acid in the bhlh zipper domain . this glutamic acid residue is also conserved in the basic dna binding domain of _PROTEIN_ . the bhlh family of transcription _PROTEIN_ is characterized by an acidic domain near the n terminus and a conserved bhlh dna binding and dimerization domain near the c terminus . all these features are present in _PROTEIN_ protein . to analyze the _PROTEIN_ pattern of _PROTEIN_ in different tissues lines of transgenic arabidopsis plants _PROTEIN_ an _PROTEIN_ promoter gus transgene were analyzed.gus _PROTEIN_ was detected in roots leaves stem and floral parts . semiquantitative rt pcr analysis also showed that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ constitutively and the _PROTEIN_ was stronger in leaves and _METHOD_ than in other tissues . rna blot analysis showed that transcript was slightly up regulated by cold nacl and aba but not by dehydration . to examine the subcellular localization of the _PROTEIN_ protein _PROTEIN_ was fused in frame to the c terminal side of the green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ under control of the camv promoter . confocal imaging of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ in transgenic plants showed that the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion protein is present in the _LOCATION_ under either warm or cold temperatures . _PROTEIN_ has a bhlh domain and its amino acid sequence in the basic region is highly conserved with other bhlh proteins and therefore may recognize promoter elements similar to the dna binding sites for known bhlh proteins . these proteins recognize dna with the consensus sequence _PROTEIN_ . in the promoter region of _PROTEIN_ there are five potential myc recognition elements within a kb region upstream of the transcription initiation site . these possible myc recognition sites designated myc through myc fall into four groups because myc and myc share the same consensus sequence catttg . thus myc was used to represent both myc and myc . to determine whether _PROTEIN_ binds to these myc recognition sites in the _PROTEIN_ promoter we _PROTEIN_ and purified his _PROTEIN_ fusion protein from e. coli . four dna fragments encompassing each possible myc recognition site were used for interaction with his _PROTEIN_ in an electrophoresis mobility shift assay _METHOD_ . several complexes were observed when _PROTEIN_ was incubated with any of the four dna fragments indicating that _PROTEIN_ is able to bind to these sequences . the myc fragment formed one major complex with _PROTEIN_ while the other dna fragments formed several complexes with _PROTEIN_ . these complexes were abolished by the addition of increasing amounts of cold competitors with the same sequences but not by or which contains a putative myb recognition site and a nonrelated sequence respectively . this specificity of competition strengthens the hypothesis that the interaction between dna and _PROTEIN_ requires the myc recognition sequences . when the myc fragment was used as a probe the complex was most efficiently competed off by the cold myc competitor suggesting that _PROTEIN_ has a higher affinity for the myc site than for the other sites . the complex formed by _PROTEIN_ and the myc fragment was less affected by a mutated competitor than by the wild type competitor . together these results show that _PROTEIN_ interacts specifically with the myc recognition sites in the _PROTEIN_ promoter . the _PROTEIN_ does not appear to affect _PROTEIN_ interaction with promoter because the arg to his mutant form of _PROTEIN_ was also able to bind to the myc probe . transient _PROTEIN_ assays were carried out to determine acts as a transcriptional activator or repressor . an effector plasmid was constructed by fusing _PROTEIN_ with the dna binding domain of the yeast transcriptional activator _PROTEIN_ . when the wild type _PROTEIN_ and a responsive reporter gene luc were delivered into arabidopsisleaves by particle bombardment the luciferase activity increased fold relative to the control with or without an effector plasmid containing only the dna binding domain . the arg to his mutant form of _PROTEIN_ also activated responsive transcription . these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ is a transcriptional activator and that the _PROTEIN_ does not affect the function of the transcriptional activation domain . a null allele of _PROTEIN_ created by t dna insertion does not show any phenotypes of the dominant _PROTEIN_ mutant suggesting that there is functional redundancy in the _PROTEIN_ family . we overexpressed _PROTEIN_ in wild typearabidopsis plants by using the strong constitutive super promoter . none of the overexpression lines showed any _PROTEIN_ phenotypes . rna blot analysis showed overexpression did not activate _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ at warm temperatures . however _PROTEIN_ overexpression enhanced the _PROTEIN_ of the endogenous _PROTEIN_ gene as well as luc reporter gene in the cold . cold induction of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ also enhanced in the super _PROTEIN_ transgenic plants . when the super _PROTEIN_ transgenic plants and wild type control plants in the same agar plates were cold acclimated at for d and then subjected to freezing treatment at for h the _PROTEIN_ overexpression transgenic seedlings showed a higher survival rate than that of control plants . the _PROTEIN_ overexpression transgenic plants did not exhibit obvious growth or developmental abnormalities . these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ is a positive regulator of _PROTEIN_ and that the dominant nature is likely caused by a dominant negative effect of the mutation .
