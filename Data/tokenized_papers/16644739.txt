plant genomes contain genetically encoded _METHOD_ of most nucleotide sugar interconversion enzymes . here we show that arabidopsis thaliana has five genes encoding functional udp d _PROTEIN_ d galactose epimerase _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . all a. thaliana udp d _PROTEIN_ epimerase _METHOD_ are dimeric in solution maximally active in vitro at and show good activity between ph and ph . in vitro _PROTEIN_ and act independently of externally added nad whereas cofactor addition stimulates the activity of _PROTEIN_ and is particularly important for _PROTEIN_ activity . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are most efficiently inhibited by udp . the five _METHOD_ display values between and s and values between and mm . this results in enzymatic efficiencies ranging between and mm s for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ < _PROTEIN_ < _PROTEIN_ < _PROTEIN_ . the values derived from the haldane relationship were mm for _PROTEIN_ mm for _PROTEIN_ and between and mm for _PROTEIN_ and . the _PROTEIN_ of uge _METHOD_ is ubiquitous and displays developmental and cell type dependent variations . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ patterns globally resemble enzymes involved in _PROTEIN_ catabolism and _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ is more related to _PROTEIN_ biosynthesis . _PROTEIN_ and are present in the cytoplasm is additionally enriched close to _LOCATION_ stacks . all uge genes tested complement the _PROTEIN_ phenotype confer increased galactose tolerance in planta and complement the galactose metabolization deficiency in the saccharomyces cerevisiae _PROTEIN_ mutant . we suggest that plant uge _METHOD_ function in different metabolic situations and that enzymatic properties gene _PROTEIN_ pattern and subcellular localization contribute to the differentiation of isoform function .
uge _METHOD_ are dimeric and can interact homo and hetero five a. thaliana uge genes are predicted to code for polypeptides of kda . dynamic light scattering of all five uges indicates molecular _METHOD_ between and kda suggesting dimeric quaternary structure . in agreement with that interpretation all uges elute as single peaks corresponding to kda proteins in gel filtration experiments . yeast two hybrid assays detect self interaction of uge proteins and reveal interaction between different uge _METHOD_ . in this system the affinities of both homotypic and heterotypic interactions are relatively weak leading to activation of the his but not of the ade reporter genes . differential effect of temperature ph and purified enzymes corresponding to each of the five _METHOD_ interconvert udp glc and udp gal with a keq of . as expected keq is identical for all _METHOD_ . the uge _METHOD_ exhibit different temperature optima . _PROTEIN_ is most active at whereas temperature optima of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are at and of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ at . in mes buffer between ph and ph and in tris/hcl buffer between ph and ph the uges are most active at neutral to alkaline ph and increasingly inhibited at weakly acidic ph . at ph _PROTEIN_ is most active displaying of maximal activity whereas _PROTEIN_ is virtually inactive . at ph this relationship is inverted _PROTEIN_ being active to of maximal activity whereas the activity of _PROTEIN_ still shows of the rate at the optimal ph . in tris/hcl ph and ph all _METHOD_ are considerably more active than in mes buffers at identical ph . inclusion of or mm nacl increases the activity of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and inhibits _PROTEIN_ . at mm nacl _PROTEIN_ activity is reduced to of the nacl free control whereas the activities of the remaining four _METHOD_ remain between and of the control activity . effect of metabolites on uge activities of _PROTEIN_ and are not affected by the presence or absence of mm nad . in contrast _PROTEIN_ activity is increased almost fold and _PROTEIN_ activity is stimulated fold by mm nad . inclusion of nadh in general has little effect however _PROTEIN_ is slightly inhibited . nadph has a very weak inhibitory effect on all five _METHOD_ . the most marked effect of various nucleotides on uge activity was observed with udp which reduced _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ to of control activity . all _METHOD_ are more strongly inhibited by udp than by the other nucleotides tested . interestingly _PROTEIN_ was the one isoform that was inhibited least by all nucleotides tested . likewise _PROTEIN_ was least inhibited by udp sugars whereas the remaining _METHOD_ were inhibited by udp d _PROTEIN_ acid udp d xylose udp l arabinose and udp d n acetylglucosamine . sensitivity of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ to dinucleotide of _PROTEIN_ activity on nad concentration can be described according to single site saturation kinetics with half maximal stimulation by nad at . the affinity between nad and _PROTEIN_ appears to be higher than between nad and _PROTEIN_ as substantial _PROTEIN_ activity is detected in the absence of added cofactor . between and nad there is a steady increase in _PROTEIN_ activity . however the fit with a two site saturation model is far better than with a single site saturation model . it is conceivable that one nad binding site per _PROTEIN_ dimer binds nad with very high affinity whereas the second site has lower affinity . this would explain the residual activity of in the absence of added nad and the saturation type kinetics between and of activity by the addition of increasing levels of nad . we further investigated the effect of various combinations of nad and nadh on _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ activity . _PROTEIN_ is inhibited to of control activity by a combination of nadh and . _PROTEIN_ is maximally inhibited by the same combination but is also inhibited by all other nad /nadh combinations . uge fitting using sigmaplot indicates that udp gal binding sites of all five uge _METHOD_ behave according to simple michaelis menten kinetics . the most obvious difference between the five _METHOD_ is their turnover rate . under standard assay conditions of _PROTEIN_ is lowest at s and that of _PROTEIN_ highest at s . variations of between uge _METHOD_ are less dramatic ranging from to mm for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ respectively . both and values vary slightly between the different enzyme concentrations used . despite the partial overlap between of different uge _METHOD_ assayed at different enzyme concentrations the enzymatic efficiencies clearly distinguish the _METHOD_ . the enzymatic velocities for udp glc determined at high substrate concentrations allow us to estimate . for _PROTEIN_ and this value is fold lower than and for _PROTEIN_ it is fold lower . notably of _PROTEIN_ is fold higher than . when the haldane relationship is applied to the experimentally determined values of the equilibrium ratio and to derive relatively high values are obtained for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ whereas the remaining _METHOD_ display higher substrate affinities for udp glc compared with udp gal . _PROTEIN_ of uge demonstrated previously the _PROTEIN_ of all uge _METHOD_ in every plant organ . this observation is confirmed by the meta analysis of publicly available global _PROTEIN_ data . moreover this analysis reveals subtle variations between the uge genes . there is a relatively high abundance of _PROTEIN_ and transcripts in seeds and inflorescence and flower and an apparent up regulation of _PROTEIN_ and in leaves during senescence . _PROTEIN_ transcript level is very high in dark elongating hypocotyls . transcript of _PROTEIN_ on the other hand is most abundant in roots in particular in the root elongation zone . previous analysis of uge promoter _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plants indicated subtle differences of uge _PROTEIN_ in roots . these are confirmed by querying a digital gene _PROTEIN_ map of the a. thaliana root . according to these two data sets _PROTEIN_ and are strongly _PROTEIN_ in the _PROTEIN_ root cap and in the underlying meristematic cells . _PROTEIN_ and transcripts are both abundant in the root elongation zone . in the differentiation and mature zone all _METHOD_ except _PROTEIN_ are abundant . we compared the global fluctuations of transcript abundance of genes involved in _PROTEIN_ biosynthesis to stresses by co response analysis in csb.db and also by using an alternative approach . both approaches consistently indicate that transcript levels of _PROTEIN_ and behave in a fundamentally different way to stresses than do _PROTEIN_ and transcript levels . the same trend is seen when abiotic stress aboveground organs developmental or miscellaneous data sets which contain fewer genes than the abiotic stress roots data set are used as the _PROTEIN_ . generally there is a strong similarity of global _PROTEIN_ patterns of _PROTEIN_ and on the one hand and of _PROTEIN_ and on the other hand . the genes encoding enzymes that are likely to be involved in the generation of udp gal from free galactose are the genes coding galactokinase _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and the a. thaliana galactose phosphate uridylyltransferase homolog and these display a stress regulated _PROTEIN_ pattern similar to _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . in contrast _PROTEIN_ biosynthetic enzymes that utilize udp gal as substrate are _PROTEIN_ in a similar fashion to _PROTEIN_ and . these include xyloglucan specific galactosyltransferase _PROTEIN_ and its close homolog _PROTEIN_ also thought to be involved in xyloglucan galactosylation as well as several genes encoding galactinol synthase _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . among enzymes utilizing udp glc as substrate several genes of the glycosyltransferase family known to encode trehalose phosphate synthase are co _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ . this suggests a role for _PROTEIN_ and in the reaction from udp gal to udp glc which is required for the re metabolization of galactose released from catabolized _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ and appear to be involved in the generation of udp gal from udp glc to generate building blocks for _PROTEIN_ biosynthesis . uge _METHOD_ are differentially localized in the uge genes encoding _METHOD_ protein either at the amino or at the _PROTEIN_ terminus of _PROTEIN_ restore the wild type root phenotype in _PROTEIN_ mutant plants suggesting that _METHOD_ protein tagging leaves uges functional . translational fusions of _PROTEIN_ and and _METHOD_ proteins are detectably _PROTEIN_ in root tips . moreover _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ is detected in all cell types of hypocotyls and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ is detected in guard cells in all aboveground organs . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ is detected in every cell type of root tip including the root cap and the root epidermis whereas visibility of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in roots is essentially restricted to the root cap . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ is detected specifically in roots with particularly strong _PROTEIN_ in the elongating epidermis and cortex cells . the cell type specific _PROTEIN_ pattern of functional _METHOD_ uge fusion proteins driven by the endogenous promoters is consistent with the promoter gus fusions as well as digital in situ data . as expected from the apparent absence of amino terminal secretion signals in the peptide sequences of a. thaliana uge _METHOD_ the _METHOD_ of all uge _METHOD_ protein fusions suggests subcellular localization in the _LOCATION_ . the diffuse cytoplasmic _METHOD_ is interspersed with _METHOD_ _LOCATION_ sometimes forming transvacuolar strands but otherwise unstructured . both _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ display a comparable localization . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ localization also appears to be _LOCATION_ however many cells in the root elongation zone also contain brightly _METHOD_ granular structures potentially highlighting specific organelles . comparable structures are not highlighted by the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ construct that is _PROTEIN_ at a similar level in the root epidermis . this suggests that despite their overlapping _PROTEIN_ in the root epidermis _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ are differentially localized in the cytoplasm . antibodies raised and affinity purified against the _PROTEIN_ terminus of _PROTEIN_ bind to the periphery of _LOCATION_ stacks and also diffusely to the cytoplasm . the absence of a signal in sections of _PROTEIN_ mutants that contain a premature stop codon demonstrates the specificity of the antibody . chemical fixation resulted in comparable antigen distribution . in summary the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and are co localized in the _LOCATION_ but _PROTEIN_ is specifically enriched in the periphery of _LOCATION_ stacks in the root elongation zone . uge _METHOD_ act in both directions in test the action of various uge _METHOD_ in planta we _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and as well as gale from e. coli in the _PROTEIN_ mutant under the control of the constitutive cauliflower mosaic virus promoter . the loss of function of _PROTEIN_ results in dramatically swollen root epidermal cells _PROTEIN_ probably a result of defective cell wall _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ biosynthesis . this phenotype is rescued by transformation of _PROTEIN_ with a wild type _PROTEIN_ gene as well as with all overexpressed uge _METHOD_ from a. thaliana and e. coli _PROTEIN_ . mutants in _PROTEIN_ display a deficiency in fuco galactosylated xyloglucan and arabinogalactan type ii as highlighted by immunocytochemistry using the monoclonal antibodies ccrc and ccrc respectively . like the morphological defects of _PROTEIN_ the chemical cell wall defects are suppressed by overexpressing _PROTEIN_ . to test if the various uge _METHOD_ can act as udp d galactose epimerases in vivo we made use of the observation that increased uge activity enhances galactose tolerance . transfer of day old untransformed wild type and _PROTEIN_ mutant seedlings to media containing mm d galactose as the sole _PROTEIN_ source leads to the inhibition of _PROTEIN_ root outgrowth and to necrosis in the primary root tip . plants overexpressing _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or gale do not show inhibition of _PROTEIN_ root outgrowth and root necrosis upon transfer to mm d galactose . all a. thaliana uge coding sequences complement the inability of _PROTEIN_ s. cerevisiae mutants to grow on a medium containing d galactose as their sole _PROTEIN_ source thus demonstrating their udp d galactose epimerase activity in vivo .
cloning and recombinant _PROTEIN_ of uges in escherichia _PROTEIN_ bacterial _PROTEIN_ was described previously . using a. thaliana wild type seedling total cdna as template the coding sequences of _PROTEIN_ and were amplified using the following oligonucleotides f catatgggttcttctgtggagcag r _PROTEIN_ f _PROTEIN_ r _PROTEIN_ f catatgggttcttctgtggaacag r _PROTEIN_ f _PROTEIN_ and r _PROTEIN_ respectively . pcr products were cloned into pgem t and individual clones were sequenced . correct open reading frames of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were released using ndei and bglii _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were released using vspi and bglii and ligated into ndei and bglii digested gel purified . because _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ cdna sequences contain internal ndei sites vspi was used for cloning into . this procedure introduces asparagine residue between the uge peptide and the amino acid long amino terminal hexahistidine peptide . recombinant uge proteins were _PROTEIN_ and affinity purified as described previously for _PROTEIN_ . uge preparations containing glycerol were frozen on dry ice and kept at . after purification staining with sypro ruby protein gel stain revealed a certain degree of unspecific proteins bound to the hisbind affinity _PROTEIN_ . the content of recombinant _PROTEIN_ was and respectively . to keep the manipulation of the proteins as low as possible no further purification step was attempted . specific enzyme concentration was determined by co electrophoresis of ng of protein assay standard ii lyophilized bovine serum albumin scanning the gel on a proxpress proteomic imaging system using nm excitation and nm emission filters and quantification of specific bands by labworks software . cloning and recombinant _PROTEIN_ of uges in cdna inserts were cleaved from the pgem t plasmids using ndei _PROTEIN_ or asei/vspi _PROTEIN_ and bglii and then gel purified . the fragments were cloned into the ndei and bamhi restriction sites of the cleaved and de phosphorylated yeast two hybrid plasmids and . for functional complementation of the uge deficient yeast mutant the bait plasmids and _PROTEIN_ to were transformed into the _PROTEIN_ strain by small scale transformation and transformants were selected on sd/ trp selective medium . for the complementation assay transformed mutant cells were grown at on sd/ trp selective medium and galactose solid medium bacto peptone galactose micro agar w/v . all uge _METHOD_ were tested for interaction both with _METHOD_ and with each other by yeast two hybrid assays . each uge bait _PROTEIN_ was co transformed with uge prey _PROTEIN_ into the reporter strain and double transformants were selected on sd/ leu/ trp medium . for yeast two hybrid interaction assays double transformants were grown on sd/ his/ trp/ leu for selection of activation of the his reporter gene and on sd/ ade/ his/ trp/ leu for selection of activation of the his and the ade reporter genes . udp gal epimerase was assayed as described previously . the standard epimerase reaction was performed in mm tris/hcl ph containing mm nad and acetylated bsa at unless stated otherwise . to start kinetic measurements of udp gal solution was added to of pre warmed enzyme solution and the reaction was stopped after min by adding of m hcl . after min at and cooling of m naoh was added . _PROTEIN_ was quantified in a coupled reaction by adding a solution containing horseradish peroxidase _PROTEIN_ oxidase and o dianisidine dihydrochloride in mm sodium phosphate buffer ph for min at room temperature against a _PROTEIN_ standard series in a buffer identical to the epimerase buffer . the reactions were stopped by adding m hcl and the absorbance was detected at nm . the linearity of the epimerase reaction was tested between and min and by varying enzyme concentrations . maximal reaction rate and km values were determined by varying udp gal concentration between and mm using best fit to single site saturation kinetics in the pharmacology menu of sigmaplot software . to determine keq udp glc was converted by re adding fresh enzyme until there was no further change in the udp glc udp gal ratio . udp glc epimerase velocity of conversion of udp glc to udp gal was determined at mm udp glc in a volume of mm tris/hcl ph containing mm nad and acetylated bsa at . the epimerase reaction was stopped after min with of m hcl hydrolyzed at for min and neutralized using a mole equivalent of naoh . galactose was quantified in a coupled reaction by adding of a solution containing horseradish peroxidase galactose oxidase and mm amplex red in a mm tris/hcl ph mm buffer against a galactose standard in a buffer identical to the epimerase buffer . because detection of _METHOD_ produced unsatisfactorily high variability the absorbance of the oxidized amplex red was detected at nm in well microtiter plates using a spectramax plate reader . the absorbance differential between and s of reaction time typically gave the best linearity of the reaction . amplex red was handled to ensure minimal light exposure . to ensure linearity of the epimerase reaction a range of enzyme concentrations was tested . to ensure substrate saturation mm udp glc was used . the direct determination of km udp glc at low substrate concentrations did not yield reproducible data because of low signal to noise ratio . therefore the value was derived from the haldane relationship shown in equation using keq of and the kinetic constants corresponding to the highest rate of udp gal conversion . overexpression of uges

gaattcttaatcgggatatccctgtggatg and an e. coli colony as the template . pcr products were cloned into pgem t and sequenced . after release of the inserts by restriction digest the fragments were cloned into pgreenii containing a cauliflower mosaic virus promoter terminator cassette and basta resistance . a. thaliana _PROTEIN_ mutant plants were transformed using vacuum infiltration with agrobacterium strain containing overexpression constructs . the transgenic line _PROTEIN_ cdna was kindly provided by p. . translational uge _METHOD_ protein generate _PROTEIN_ terminal translational

_PROTEIN_ . the terminator regions were added after the _METHOD_ stop codon using noti and apai digestion of the corresponding uge _METHOD_ recombinant clones . the resulting fusion constructs were cloned into and transformed into _PROTEIN_ mutant and wild type plants as described above . to generate an amino terminal _METHOD_ fusion of _PROTEIN_ the dna of enhanced green _METHOD_ protein was

_PROTEIN_ promoter sequence were fused by mixing the purified pcr products and amplification using the oligonucleotides _PROTEIN_ f and cy _METHOD_ asci . the resulting product was cloned into pgem t and sequenced . the _PROTEIN_ gene including the terminator region was amplified using the following oligonucleotide primers _PROTEIN_ aagggcgcgccgatggttgggaatattctggtgaccggtggt not _PROTEIN_ aaaaggaaaagcggccgcatttttatataaatgaaatgagaatgtggatg and were cloned into pgem t and sequenced . the _PROTEIN_ sequence was excised using asci and noti and cloned into the _PROTEIN_ promoter _METHOD_ fusion containing clone . the resulting fusion was cloned into and transformed into _PROTEIN_ mutants as described above . _PROTEIN_ specific specific antiserum was raised commercially by immunization of rabbits with a peptide corresponding to the _PROTEIN_ terminal amino acid residues of _PROTEIN_ conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin . specific antibodies were subsequently affinity purified using immobilized peptide . the _PROTEIN_ mutant that contains a premature stop codon before the _PROTEIN_ terminal half of _PROTEIN_ served as control in various assays . in microscopic applications the antiserum produced an unspecific signal in cell walls but bound specifically to intracellular _PROTEIN_ . immunogold transmission electron of day old seedlings were excised and were vacuum infiltrated for min with mes . the samples were high pressure frozen freeze substituted in acetone containing uranyl acetate and embedded in lr white resin as described previously . ultrathin sections of nm were taken using a leica ultramicrotome and picked up on pyroxylin and _PROTEIN_ coated gold grids . for immunogold labeling grids were incubated on drops of mm glycine/pbs for min followed by drops of pre prepared aurion blocking buffer for min and then equilibrated in bsa c/pbs . grids were incubated with the primary antibody diluted in equilibration buffer overnight at washed five times in equilibration buffer and incubated for h with the secondary antibody conjugated to nm gold diluted in equilibration buffer . after four washes in equilibration buffer min washes three times in _PROTEIN_ and min washes two times in water the grids were contrast stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate before observation in a jeol ex transmission electron microscope at kv . photographic images were taken using kodak electron image film . meta analysis of publicly available _PROTEIN_ on organ specific _PROTEIN_ were obtained from the genevestigator data base using the gene atlas tool . _PROTEIN_ signals for each uge gene were normalized . cell type specific gene _PROTEIN_ data in root tips were published previously and spatial representations were queried online . the degree of co _PROTEIN_ between individual genes was queried in the comprehensive _METHOD_ biology data base or by an alternative approach using pre processing of raw data and discretization of signal changes
