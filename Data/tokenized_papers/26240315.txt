limited knowledge of how plants regulate their growth and metabolism in response to drought and reduced soil water potential has impeded efforts to improve stress tolerance . increased _PROTEIN_ of the _LOCATION_ associated protein _PROTEIN_ led to increased growth and accumulation of the osmoprotective solute proline without negative effects on unstressed plants . conversely inducible rna interference suppression of _PROTEIN_ growth and proline accumulation during low water potential while having no effect on unstressed plants . overexpression lines had reduced _PROTEIN_ of many stress responsive genes suggesting may promote growth in part by suppression of negative regulatory genes . interacted with the endomembrane proteins protein disulfide isomerase _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ with the _PROTEIN_ interaction being particularly increased by stress . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are negative regulatory _PROTEIN_ as _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants had increased growth and proline accumulation at low water potential . also interacted with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ which is part of a complex that recruits cargo proteins and promotes assembly of clathrin coated vesicles . colocalization with clathrin light chain along the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ together with predictions of structure were consistent with a role in vesicle formation or trafficking . fractionation experiments indicated that is a peripheral _LOCATION_ protein associated with both _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and endomembranes . these data identify classes of proteins _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ not previously known to be involved in drought signaling . predicted structure protein interactions and localization all indicate its involvement in previously uncharacterized _LOCATION_ associated drought sensing or signaling _METHOD_ .
although contains a small integrin similarity domain the overall structure was clearly different from integrins . this structure was intriguing as we know little of _LOCATION_ associated proteins involved in abiotic stress . in previous microarray experiments gene _PROTEIN_ was induced fold by exposure to low for h . rt pcr verified a strong induction of _PROTEIN_ and a stress increased protein of appropriate size was detected using a commercial antibody recognizing integrin . antisera specifically recognizing the n terminal domain of confirmed that protein abundance was dramatically increased by low . to test the function of we generated transgenic lines with promoter driven ectopic _PROTEIN_ of fused to either an n terminal enhanced yellow florescent protein _METHOD_ or a c terminal _PROTEIN_ tag . both types of o.e . lines had essentially identical phenotypes and combined data from both are shown in subsequent figures . transgenic lines with dexamethasone inducible rnai knockdown of were also generated . quantitative rt pcr and immunoblotting verified increased or _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in the o.e . and k.d . lines respectively . there are no publically available transfer dna mutants for . when seedlings were transferred to either a moderate _PROTEIN_ or more severe _PROTEIN_ low stress o.e . lines had dramatically increased root elongation increased seedling dry weight and increased fresh weight . the plants were also visually larger than wild type . overexpression had no apparent negative effect and even increased growth in the absence of stress . similar results of increased rosette weight and size were seen in o.e . plants subjected to controlled soil drying . conversely growth of k.d . lines at low was _PROTEIN_ by more than after the addition of dex to activate rnai suppression of . rnai suppression of had no effect on growth in the control and addition of dex had no effect on an empty vector control line . o.e . lines also had higher accumulation of the osmoprotective solute proline whereas k.d . lines had reduced proline across a range of low severities . o.e . also modified the transcriptional response to low which in wild type included both up and down regulation of many genes . the predominant effect of o.e . lines was to suppress gene _PROTEIN_ genes were down regulated by o.e . lines in control and genes at low compared with genes up regulated by o.e . lines in control and at low . many of these were genes already stress down regulated in wild type . _PROTEIN_ of several genes down regulated in o.e . lines was verified by quantitative rt pcr . gene ontology _METHOD_ enriched in the down regulated genes include transcription _PROTEIN_ cell wall defense response oxidative metabolism and _LOCATION_ proteins . gene ontology _METHOD_ enriched in genes up regulated by overexpression include protein disulfide oxidoreductase activity and redox related metabolism lipid metabolism and cytokinin metabolism . interestingly we found that o.e . lines blocked stress induction of _PROTEIN_ a procell death protease the trafficking and activity of which are regulated by protein disulfide isomerase _PROTEIN_ . overall the growth and proline data indicated a key role of in drought resistance whereas the gene _PROTEIN_ data raised the possibility that may restrict the _PROTEIN_ of genes that suppress growth during low stress . to understand function we identified interacting proteins using several methods . yeast two hybrid library screening using the n terminal domain of as bait identified the _LOCATION_ chaperone _PROTEIN_ the _LOCATION_ body protein _PROTEIN_ and the _PROTEIN_ related protein _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ as well as partial clones containing the c terminal domain of and _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were also identified in immunoprecipitates . additional putative interacting proteins were identified by immunoprecipitation including _PROTEIN_ part of a protein complex involved in clathrin coated vesicle formation as well as other vesicle transport components and _LOCATION_ related proteins . mating based split ubiquitin assays using full length as bait confirmed interaction with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . also consistent with the yeast two hybrid screening strongly interacted with itself . dynamin _PROTEIN_ and the _LOCATION_ protein _PROTEIN_ were identified in immunoprecipitates but did not interact with in mbsus . possibly _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ indirectly associate with via larger protein complexes . interactions were assayed in planta using ratiometric bimolecular _METHOD_ complementation which allows the bifc signal to be normalized relative to a constitutively _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ reporter . assays were conducted by transient _PROTEIN_ in intact seedlings . interestingly interaction with itself _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ was promoted fold by low . western blotting of seedlings after rbifc assay showed that the stimulated interaction of and _PROTEIN_ in the stress treatment was unlikely to be explained by differences in protein _PROTEIN_ . coimmunoprecipitation also consistently found more _PROTEIN_ association after low stress treatment . for interaction with _PROTEIN_ the increased rbifc signal in the low treatment could have been caused either by difference in protein _PROTEIN_ or increased interaction . the western blot result must be interpreted with some caution as it reflects both the number of cells _PROTEIN_ the bifc constructs and the _PROTEIN_ level in those cells . _PROTEIN_ had a very limited rbifc interaction with which was not stimulated by stress . thus _PROTEIN_ may not function with in vivo . consistent with the mbsus assays no _PROTEIN_ interaction was observed in rbifc . low stimulation of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ interactions could also be detected using another vector system . in contrast to the _PROTEIN_ interaction the previously reported interaction of _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ could be readily detected under both control and stress conditions . _PROTEIN_ rbifc with coexpression of an _LOCATION_ marker showed extensive but not complete overlap of the signals . thus _PROTEIN_ interaction is likely to occur in the endomembrane system but perhaps not exclusively in the _LOCATION_ . in leaf epidermal cells was found in tubule like structures typical of _LOCATION_ . the interaction experiments suggested that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ may function with in stress signaling occurring in the endomembrane system . consistent with this _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants had increased root elongation dry weight and proline with the only exception being that the effect of _PROTEIN_ was specific to the shoot . a _PROTEIN_ double mutant had an even greater increase in seedling dry weight after low treatment whereas proline accumulation did not increase further and root elongation had only the _PROTEIN_ effect . these data indicated that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ have partially overlapping roles as negative regulators of growth and proline accumulation at low . previous reports on _PROTEIN_ described it as a pm protein and colocalized with along the pm . however was not evenly distributed along the pm and appeared in part as small foci along the _LOCATION_ . the strong interaction of with _PROTEIN_ along with localization raised the possibility that may be involved in trafficking of clathrin coated vesicles . consistent with this hypothesis _METHOD_ colocalized with morange labeled clathrin light chain at distinct foci along the pm . foci of often corresponded to small foci of clc indicative of the early stages of endocytotic vesicle formation . in other cases clc colocalization could be seen at the junction between the clc labeled vesicle like particles and the pm . internalized clc labeled structures detached from the pm had little or no colocalized . likewise that was diffusely localized inside the cell did not colocalize with clc . occasionally small puncta of colocalized and clc could be seen inside the cell but this was less common . these patterns could be seen in both unstressed and stressed plants however clc colocalization was significantly increased by stress . a range of pcc values was observed . in general images that included many large internalized clc labeled vesicle like structures had lower pcc values whereas those with more clc along the pm had higher pcc values . bleed through between the _METHOD_ and morange channels was minimal and did not affect the results . tyrphostin an inhibitor of clathrin coated vesicle formation and endocytosis blocked the increased proline accumulation of o.e . plants but had no effect on _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ mutants . this indicated that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ affect proline accumulation by other _METHOD_ or act downstream of endocytosis . tyrphostin _PROTEIN_ the area of endosome like particles decorated with but had no substantial effect on distribution along the pm or protein levels . internalization of from pm was investigated using brefeldin a . bfa resulted in some accumulation of _METHOD_ in bfa bodies but this was not increased by stress and the amount of in bfa bodies was small compared with the amount along the pm . together the colocalization and bfa data indicated that was associated with formation of clathrin coated vesicles however was not a major cargo protein internalized by clathrin coated vesicles under stress . structural modeling using several publically available resources gave additional clues to function . modweb found a similarity of to a bacterial pore forming toxin amphiphysin and moesin . amphiphysin contains a bin amphiphysin reduced viability on starvation domain that binds to sites of _LOCATION_ curvature . i tasser found similarity to the same bacterial protein as well as actinin spectrin another bar domain protein _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and cell adhesion components . similarity to actin and clathrin binding sites was also found . the amphiphysin similarity is particularly interesting as amphiphysin associates with _PROTEIN_ at the neck of vesicles in the same complex as dynamin before the vesicle detaches from the pm . this agrees with our observations of interaction with _PROTEIN_ and foci of at and around sites of clc concentration along the pm . the structural modeling raised questions of whether is really a transmembrane protein as previously suggested for _PROTEIN_ . aqueous two phase partitioning found that associated with both pm and endomembrane . the localization was most clear after longer low treatment when increased and could be seen in both _LOCATION_ fractions . similar results were observed for _PROTEIN_ o.e . plants . in this case an increased amount of in the lower fraction during stress despite the constitutive _PROTEIN_ may indicate stabilization or altered turnover of . interestingly was also detected in the supernatant during the initial stages of _LOCATION_ fractionation . consideration of gel loading versus total volume of supernatant or _LOCATION_ pellet indicated that most was in the supernatant rather than _LOCATION_ pellet and was of the higher molecular weight form . low salt or edta washes could completely remove from the _LOCATION_ pellet . thus is _LOCATION_ associated but not a transmembrane protein similar to _PROTEIN_ . found in the endomembrane had higher than expected apparent molecular weight indicating that may be posttranslationally modified . the nature of this posttranslational modification and why it was present on the endomembrane localized but less detected in pm fractions is not known . we also can not rule out more complex patterns of cleavage and modification . _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ could be involved in posttranslational modification in the endomembrane system or control the trafficking of . however fractionation of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ found no substantial differences in molecular weight distribution or total protein amount compared with wild type . these experiments do not rule out redundancy for example with other pdis which may obscure the role of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in modification .
