heterologous _PROTEIN_ of plant genes in yeast and animal cells represents a common approach to study plant ion channels . when _PROTEIN_ in xenopus oocytes and _PROTEIN_ cells the arabidopsis shaker like k channel _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ a weakly voltage dependent channel blocked by and protons . channels with these characteristics however were not found in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ arabidopsis cell types . to understand this phenomenon we employed agrobacterium mediated transient transformation to functionally characterise arabidopsis thaliana channels in nicotiana benthamiana mesophyll cells . in this _PROTEIN_ system we used _PROTEIN_ as a control for voltage independent a. thaliana channels . agrobacteria harbouring _METHOD_ tagged constructs with the coding sequences of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were infiltrated into intact tobacco leaves . with quantitative rt pcr analyses channel transcripts of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were determined in transformed leaves . these results were confirmed by western blots with epitope tagged _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ proteins showing that the channel protein was indeed synthesised . for functional analysis of these channels mesophyll protoplasts were isolated from infiltrated leaf sections . patch clamp studies revealed that _PROTEIN_ channels in mesophyll protoplasts retained and ph sensitivity characteristics of the heterologously _PROTEIN_ protein but displayed pronounced differences in voltage dependence and kinetics . _PROTEIN_ transformed mesophyll cells displayed inward rectifying rather than voltage independent k channels initially characterised in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ animal cells . in contrast _PROTEIN_ showed the same electrophysiological characteristics both in oocytes and plant cells . our data suggest that heterologous _METHOD_ do not always possess all regulatory components for functional _PROTEIN_ of plant channels . therefore transient _PROTEIN_ of plant proteins in planta provides an additional research tool for rapid biophysical analysis of plant ion channels .
to demonstrate that transient _PROTEIN_ of plant channels in plant cells represents an alternative to yeast and animal _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ different t dna constructs were generated containing the coding sequences for _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or _PROTEIN_ under control of a promoter . a. tumefaciens strains carrying the appropriate plasmid were infiltrated into the intercellular space of n. benthamiana leaves together with the agrobacterium strain encoding the soil borne wheat mosaic virus k gene . the latter is suggested to suppress posttranscriptional gene silencing . three to four days after agroinfiltration with the different _METHOD_ marked constructs tobacco leaves and mesophyll protoplasts were subjected to confocal laser scanning microscopy to identify transformed cells and fluorescing protoplasts thereof . _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was observed in almost all epidermal cells and in of mesophyll cells within the infiltrated leaf region . in order to analyse the abundance of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ transcripts in transformed cells we performed quantitative rt pcr on mrna isolated from infiltrated tobacco leaves . _PROTEIN_ transformed cells _PROTEIN_ up to _PROTEIN_ mrna molecules per molecules of actin mrna . in _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transformed leaves the abundance of _PROTEIN_ transcripts was times lower but still high when compared to _PROTEIN_ mrna molecules in arabidopsis pollen . no _PROTEIN_ transcripts were measured in tobacco leaves _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ only . the _PROTEIN_ transcript level in _PROTEIN_ transformed tobacco leaves was much lower than that of _PROTEIN_ but approximately times higher compared to the natural _PROTEIN_ level in arabidopsis leaves of non flowering or flowering plants . to test if the _METHOD_ transient _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ affects the transcription of endogenous channels in tobacco leaves we determined transcript abundance of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ two outward rectifying k channels _PROTEIN_ in n. benthamiana mesophyll cells . the transcription level of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were not reduced by the transient _PROTEIN_ of either _METHOD_ or _PROTEIN_ . however the amount of _PROTEIN_ transcripts was higher in _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transformed leaves . to demonstrate that transient _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ genes results in synthesis of the respective channel proteins we infiltrated tobacco leaves with an agrobacterium strain carrying a epitope tagged _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ construct . protein extracts from leaves transformed with t dnas encoding _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ were separated by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and subjected to immunoblot analysis with mouse anti monoclonal antibodies . a chemiluminescent signal was associated with the binding of antibodies to the tag of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ proteins . in the _PROTEIN_ transformed sample the kda _PROTEIN_ and in _PROTEIN_ transformed leaves the kda _PROTEIN_ proteins were detected . _METHOD_ protein lacking a tag however did not bind the antibody against . these data demonstrate that agrobacterium mediated transient transformation of tobacco cells with _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ results in transcription of these genes and synthesis of channel proteins . but does it result in functional k transport proteins in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ of tobacco cells ? to gain insights into the biophysical properties of _PROTEIN_ in tobacco mesophyll cells we performed patch clamp studies on protoplasts _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ under control of a promoter subcloned into the binary vector . protoplasts were isolated from n. benthamiana leaf sections days after agroinfiltration . protoplasts of leaf discs with removed epidermis were transferred to the recording chamber and those displaying _METHOD_ _METHOD_ were selected for patch clamp measurements . in the whole cell configuration voltage pulses were applied from a holding potential of mv in mv steps in the range from to mv . in solutions containing mm k in the bath _LOCATION_ and k in the pipette _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ protoplasts were characterised by slowly activating outward currents elicited by voltages positive to mv . no macroscopic inward currents were recorded in these protoplasts at hyperpolarized voltages as negative as mv . similar electrical characteristics were found in non transfected mesophyll cells . under identical experimental conditions in _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transformed protoplasts voltages positive of mv activated outward currents which were similar to those recorded of non transformed and _METHOD_ transformed mesophyll cells . hyperpolarizing pulses negative of mv however elicited time and voltage dependent inward currents . a half activation time of inward currents at the _LOCATION_ voltage of mv was _METHOD_ . when in double pulse voltage protocol _LOCATION_ potential was changed from to mv slow exponential deactivation currents with _METHOD_ were recorded . _PROTEIN_ currents in mesophyll cells were different from those measured in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ xenopus oocytes and _PROTEIN_ . in these _PROTEIN_ backgrounds _PROTEIN_ was conducting both inward and outward k currents . currents were composed of fast and slow components which superimpose at negative voltages . since in animal cells _PROTEIN_ displayed pronounced sensitivity towards _LOCATION_ and h we studied the effect of these ions on the properties of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ tobacco protoplasts . slowly activating inward currents in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mesophyll cells were characterised by a pronounced voltage dependent block imposed by _LOCATION_ . in a double pulse voltage protocol applied in the presence of mm voltage steps from mv to mv induced a rapid drop in inward current with subsequent slow deactivation resulting from channel closure . when the same protocol was applied in the presence of mm _LOCATION_ an increase in inward current was not observed at mv . voltage steps to mv however elicited a rapid rise in tail current due to channel unblock followed by a slow deactivation phase . these experiments demonstrate that _PROTEIN_ channels are almost completely blocked by mm at hyperpolarizing voltages in the presence of mm k . to study the induced block in more detail we analysed the voltage dependence of _PROTEIN_ currents in the presence of and mm in external solution . when the external solution was changed from to mm no increase in inward current was recorded negative to mv indicating that binding of within the permeation pathway for k ions counteracts the increase in k current . in a mm containing bath solution inward currents were blocked already at mv . pronounced sensitivity of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ to _LOCATION_ was described in xenopus oocytes and cells . in contrast to _PROTEIN_ the heterologously _PROTEIN_ inward rectifiers _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ appear insensitive . in agreement with previous data on animal cells and in line with k selective channels _PROTEIN_ currents in mesophyll protoplasts were blocked by mm cs . it should be mentioned that in xenopus oocytes cs blocked both leak like and voltage dependent _PROTEIN_ currents . since in our experiments this blocker abolished the voltage dependent current only we concluded that small background instantaneous currents in mesophyll protoplasts are not mediated by k selective channels . to examine the effect of h on _PROTEIN_ currents the ph of the external solution was lowered from to . this increase in h concentration resulted in reduction in inward current at mv . note that outward currents were only slightly affected by a change in ph . _LOCATION_ acidification was shown to reduce _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ currents in xenopus oocytes and _PROTEIN_ cells . two amino acid residues within the outer mouth of the k conducting pore were shown to determine the ph sensitivity of _PROTEIN_ . our data indicate that although _PROTEIN_ in planta displays differences in gating behaviour it retains the and ph sensitive features of those _PROTEIN_ in animal cells . because of the pronounced differences between _PROTEIN_ recorded in plant and animal _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ we also examined _PROTEIN_ another arabidopsis k channel in tobacco mesophyll cells . this channel was recently characterised in xenopus oocytes as k selective ph and sensitive open rectifier mediating both inward and outward k currents . in contrast to control _METHOD_ protoplasts characterised by outward currents only _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ cells displayed instantaneous currents at both positive and negative voltages superimposed on slowly activating intrinsic outward currents . in the presence of mm in the bath instantaneous currents were blocked in a voltage dependent manner at potentials negative to mv . this voltage dependent _PROTEIN_ of instantaneous current and rise in electrical noise at negative potentials point to the nature of a large conductance ion channel interacting with a blocker . to compare the gating parameters of _PROTEIN_ in mesophyll cells with those in xenopus oocytes and yeast we sampled instantaneous current amplitudes at the beginning of a voltage pulse and plotted them as a function of the _LOCATION_ voltage . at potentials positive to mv instantaneous currents tended to rectify similar to those recorded in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ xenopus oocytes and yeast . in mesophyll cells however this rectification vanished within the time course of min indicating a loss of channel gating due to wash out of cytoplasmic _PROTEIN_ into the patch pipette . at voltages negative to mv _PROTEIN_ currents _PROTEIN_ because of voltage dependent block . . upon lowering the external concentration to mm the current voltage relationship became almost linear due to channel unblock . similar to the heterologously _PROTEIN_ channel _PROTEIN_ in mesophyll cells was blocked in the presence of the potassium channel blocker cs . note that cs did not inhibit outward _PROTEIN_ currents . upon replacement of k by na in the bath solution inward currents disappeared indicating that _PROTEIN_ does not allow entry of na into the cell . at the same time outward currents corresponding to k efflux via _PROTEIN_ activated positive to mv . in the cell attached configuration with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mesophyll protoplasts we recorded fluctuations of single channels with a conductance of ps which were lacking in control cells .these data demonstrate that in mesophyll cells similar to xenopus oocytes and yeast _PROTEIN_ represents a k selective open rectifier of large conductance blocked by and cs .
