the serine arginine rich _PROTEIN_ proteins constitute a conserved family of pre mrna splicing _PROTEIN_ . in arabidopsis they are encoded by genes most of which are _METHOD_ alternatively spliced . in the case of _PROTEIN_ the use of alternative splice sites nucleotides apart generates two alternatively spliced _METHOD_ . isoform _PROTEIN_ has an insertion relative to isoform _PROTEIN_ that replaces a single arginine with eight amino acids _PROTEIN_ . the biological implications of _PROTEIN_ alternative splicing have been unclear . a previously described loss of function mutant affecting both _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ shows several developmental defects including defects in _PROTEIN_ development and root growth . we found that the _PROTEIN_ promoter is highly active in regions with actively growing and dividing cells . we also tested the ability of each _PROTEIN_ isoform to complement the _PROTEIN_ mutant by overexpression of isoform specific green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ fusion proteins . as expected transgenic plants overexpressing either isoform displayed both _LOCATION_ speckles and _METHOD_ _METHOD_ throughout the nucleoplasm . we found that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ complements the flower _PROTEIN_ phenotype but not the root growth phenotype . conversely _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ complements root growth but not floral morphology . mutation of a predicted phosphorylation site within the alternatively spliced segment _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ does not affect complementation . however a double mutation affecting both serine and the adjacent threonine _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ behaves like isoform complementing the root but not the floral phenotype . in conclusion our study provides evidence that the two alternatively spliced _METHOD_ of _PROTEIN_ have distinct biological functions .
_PROTEIN_ has in addition to an rrm domain with similarity to other _PROTEIN_ proteins an n terminal low complexity domain rich in ser and arg ser repeats and a c terminal low complexity domain rich in arg ser repeats and spxr motifs . this domain structure differs from that found in other _PROTEIN_ proteins which uniformly lack an amino terminal rs domain but resembles the domain structure in _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are listed as orthologs on the inparanoid web site and have been treated as such in previous publications but citation describe _PROTEIN_ as a novel plant specific splicing _PROTEIN_ . when the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ rrm is used as a query in a blast search _PROTEIN_ is identified as the most similar human protein . conversely when the human _PROTEIN_ rrm is used as a query _PROTEIN_ is found to be the most similar arabidopsis protein . this reciprocal best hit relationship indicates but does not establish orthology . on the other hand the functions of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ proteins are related and arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ has been shown to function as a splicing _PROTEIN_ in human extracts . in the absence of data that address the critical question of whether the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ protein functions like _PROTEIN_ as part of the arabidopsis ejc we follow citation by referring to it as an _PROTEIN_ protein . extensive analysis by reverse transcription and pcr reveals two _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ that differ by a nucleotide sequence that is present in isoform _PROTEIN_ but missing in isoform _PROTEIN_ due to an alternative acceptor splice site at the beginning of the seventh exon . because the alternatively spliced segment is in frame it is likely that both _METHOD_ are functional . we first examined the response of isoform abundance to different plant hormones and environmental cues . using a common set of flanking primers we found that the relative level of the two _METHOD_ was significantly altered in response to suc _PROTEIN_ and temperature changes _PROTEIN_ . we next examined the level of these two _METHOD_ in different plant tissues using isoform specific primers to avoid competition between overlapping products during amplification . quantitative rt pcr results showed that the ratio of the two _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ is close to in root and inflorescence and only slightly less in leaf tissue . both _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ are present at much higher levels in root and inflorescence tissues than in leaves . thus despite large differences in the overall level of _PROTEIN_ there is not a significant difference between tissues with respect to the ratio of the two spliced _METHOD_ . root and inflorescence tissue both contain meristematic regions with active cell division while leaf cells are rather differentiated . this suggested that _PROTEIN_ may be preferentially _PROTEIN_ in actively dividing cells . organ specific microarray _PROTEIN_ profiles collected by genevestigator showed that the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ was detected in all plant organs with the highest levels in imbibed seeds root tip shoot apex and inflorescence tissues . previous microarray data on pollen showed that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is high in both unicellular and bicellular pollen . all of this indicates that the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ is associated with both root and flower development perhaps pollen development in particular . to examine the transcriptional regulation of _PROTEIN_ we fused the _PROTEIN_ promoter sequence to a gus reporter gene . transgenic lines carrying this reporter showed the strongest gus activity in pollen primary and secondary root meristem shoot apical meristem and leaf primordia . the gus activity was also detected in vascular tissue hydathode and cells close to the root meristem . these results are consistent with the idea that _PROTEIN_ transcription is enriched in and perhaps limited to actively dividing and rapidly growing cells . the eight amino acid segment found in _PROTEIN_ but not _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ contains a potential phosphorylation site at ser that is predicted by both the netphos server with significantly high score and by the arabidopsis protein phosphorylation site database with the prediction score of . to assess the potential functional difference between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ we introduced a point mutation at this position . in addition thr was also predicted as a possible phosphorylation site by netphos server but not phosphat . we mutated the thr to ala together with to see if has any impact on _PROTEIN_ function in addition to . we individually _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ with _METHOD_ fused at the c terminus of each proteins transiently in _PROTEIN_ mutant mesophyll protoplasts and detected _METHOD_ signal in the _LOCATION_ of transfected protoplasts for all the constructs . then we generated stable transgenic lines with these constructs in the _PROTEIN_ mutant background for in vivo functional study . in transgenic plants overexpressing _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ the narrow flower _PROTEIN_ phenotype in _PROTEIN_ mutants was rescued . similar rescue was observed by using an n terminal _METHOD_ fusion _METHOD_ in an earlier independent study . putting these results together it appears that _PROTEIN_ can tolerate a _METHOD_ fusion at either terminus . all of our studies were conducted with the c terminal _METHOD_ fusion . oddly plants overexpressing _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ did not rescue the narrow _PROTEIN_ phenotype . nor was this phenotype rescued by the double mutant . however a single mutation of behaved like wild type with respect to the flower _PROTEIN_ phenotype . these results suggested that is not required for the normal flower _PROTEIN_ development but is required either as an alternative phosphorylation site or by itself . we did not test a mutation of only . the root growth of _PROTEIN_ mutant seedlings was significantly delayed compared to wild type seedlings . neither nor were able to rescue the mutant root growth on murashige and skoog agar medium . however and seedlings exhibited normal root growth compared to the mutant and other transgenic seedlings . these results suggest that although both _METHOD_ were _PROTEIN_ in all tissues in the overexpression lines _PROTEIN_ function is more important for flower development while _PROTEIN_ function is more important for root growth . interestingly introducing in _PROTEIN_ did not change root growth but introducing mutations on both and sites in _PROTEIN_ mimicked the _PROTEIN_ function . this indicates that may be most important in distinguishing _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . two independent lines were used for each transgene and _PROTEIN_ in both root and floral tissue was verified by examination of _METHOD_ so it is unlikely that the observed differences can be attributed to positional effects of t dna insertion . in several animal species splicing _PROTEIN_ have been identified as as regulation targets during development . similar observations have been obtained in plants as well . fifteen of the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ protein genes are alternatively spliced and their as patterns change in a developmental and tissue specific manner . in both inflorescence and root tissues the as pattern of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ was altered in _PROTEIN_ mutants compared to wild type . this suggests that _PROTEIN_ may directly or indirectly regulate the splicing pattern of these _PROTEIN_ protein genes in both root and inflorescence tissues . we examined the as pattern of these five _PROTEIN_ protein genes in wild type _PROTEIN_ and all transgenic plants . in inflorescence tissues the ratio of two _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was increased in _PROTEIN_ relative to wild type and this ratio was restored toward wild type in transgenic plants that also show phenotypic rescue _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . the as pattern of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ was rescued in all transgenic plants . in root tissues the altered ratio of _PROTEIN_ seen in _PROTEIN_ was restored toward wild type levels in transgenic plants that show phenotypic rescue in the root _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . as for _PROTEIN_ the wild type ratio of isoform to isoform was restored in all transgenic plants except for those overexpressing _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . the as pattern of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ was rescued in all transgenic plants but to differing extents . these as profiles suggested that regulation of the as pattern of _PROTEIN_ may be directly associated with the flower _PROTEIN_ morphology change and the root growth difference in _PROTEIN_ mutant plants .
