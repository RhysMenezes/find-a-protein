the leucine rich repeat receptor like kinase brassinosteroid _PROTEIN_ is the _PROTEIN_ ligand perceiving receptor for brassinosteroids in arabidopsis . binding of brs to the ectodomain of _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ located _PROTEIN_ receptors initiates an intracellular signal transduction cascade that influences various aspects of plant growth and development . even though the major components of br signaling have been revealed and the pm was identified as the _PROTEIN_ site of _PROTEIN_ signaling activity the very first steps of signal transmission are still elusive . recently it was shown that the initiation of br signal transduction requires the interaction of _PROTEIN_ with its _PROTEIN_ embryogenesis receptor like kinase _PROTEIN_ coreceptors . in addition the resolved structure of the _PROTEIN_ ectodomain suggested that _PROTEIN_ associated _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ may constitute a component of the ligand perceiving receptor complex . therefore we investigated the spatial correlation between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in the natural habitat of both leucine rich repeat receptor like kinases using comparative colocalization analysis and _METHOD_ lifetime imaging microscopy . we show that activation of br signaling by exogenous ligand application resulted in both elevated colocalization between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and an about increase of receptor heterooligomerization in the pm of live arabidopsis root epidermal cells . however large populations of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ colocalized independently of brs . moreover we could visualize that approximately of the _PROTEIN_ pm pool constitutively heterooligomerizes with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in live root cells . we propose that only small populations of pm located _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ receptors participate in active br signaling and that the initiation of downstream signal transduction involves preassembled _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ heterooligomers .
to investigate the br dependent spatial correlation between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ receptors at the subcellular level in arabidopsis roots first a comparative colocalization analysis of immunolabeled tissue was performed . for simplicity we will refer to _PROTEIN_ hereafter without reference to its _PROTEIN_ designation . in figure confocal images of a double transgenic arabidopsis line _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ hemagglutinin using their native promoters are shown . immunocytochemical labeling was performed with primary antibodies against the _METHOD_ and ha epitopes visualized with and conjugated secondary antibodies respectively . under regular growth conditions _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ colocalized at the pm and to a lesser extent in endomembrane compartments . the observed endosomal structures for _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ most likely represent _LOCATION_ stacks trans _LOCATION_ network/early endosome compartments and multivesicular bodies as reported previously using live cell imaging and electron microscopy . in contrast _PROTEIN_ ha showed a more diffuse localization pattern and additionally large endomembrane compartments which could represent tonoplast _LOCATION_ were visible . colocalization analysis based on modified manders colocalizaton coefficients which indicate the fractional overlap of _METHOD_ intensities in the separate imaging channels revealed that approximately one half of the pm _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ ha receptor populations colocalize . for the intracellular endomembrane compartments manders colocalization coefficients of about and for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ respectively were determined . comparative colocalization analysis is shown for immunolabeled _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ ha in roots of d old arabidopsis seedlings coexpressing bri _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ ha . brz was added to the growth medium d after germination . bl and bfa were applied for h. _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was visualized using rabbit anti _METHOD_ anti rabbit antibodies and _PROTEIN_ ha was labeled using mouse anti ha/goat anti mouse antibodies . colocalizing fractions are presented as modified manders colocalization coefficients se . additionally pearson correlation coefficients se are given as independent measure for colocalization . n represents the number of regions of interest analyzed . to test whether ligand depletion reduces the spatial correlation of the two lrr _PROTEIN_ seedlings were cultured for d in the presence of brz prior to imaging . brz is a br biosynthesis inhibitor and reduces the amount of endogenous brs by approximately . _PROTEIN_ phosphorylation was used as a readout to confirm that brz treatment indeed abolishes br signaling . depletion of endogenous brs did not affect the localization pattern of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ or the _METHOD_ overlap at the pm . however a minor _PROTEIN_ in the colocalization of both receptors was revealed in the intracellular space . subsequently br signaling was restored by exogenous application of epi brassinolide to brz pretreated roots . in line with the findings of citation no obvious effect on the localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was observed . as shown in figure also the distribution of _PROTEIN_ ha seemed unaffected . however colocalization analysis indicated increased _METHOD_ overlap for both pm and intracellular _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ populations . the manders colocalization coefficients for pm colocalization and intracellularly located _PROTEIN_ even exceeded the initial values obtained for untreated roots . thus it _METHOD_ that the br signaling status influences the spatial correlation between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . this finding was further investigated by treatment of roots with the endosomal trafficking inhibitor brefeldin a a compound reported to result in enhanced br signaling in the absence of exogenously added ligand . the results displayed in figure clearly show that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ ha were sequestered into the large bfa compartments . significantly increased colocalization was observed at the pm the presumed site of active br signaling as suggested by citation . in general _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ distribution was more drastically affected by bfa than that of _PROTEIN_ ha . still most of the bfa compartments contained colocalizing _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ ha receptors . simultaneous application of bfa and bl additionally increased the amount of colocalizing _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ ha receptors in bfa compartments as shown in figure m to o and table i . to answer whether the partial colocalization observed for _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ ha in the same bfa compartments reflects a general phenomenon a comparative analysis was performed . the results presented in supplemental figure revealed that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ yellow _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ are highly sensitive to bfa while _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was only weakly visible in bfa compartments . this suggests that receptors operative in different pathways can employ the same adp ribosylation _PROTEIN_ guanine nucleotide exchange _PROTEIN_ mediated pathway whereas receptors that act in the same pathway may be sorted differentially . taken together our comparative colocalization analysis of immunolabeled arabidopsis roots indicates that a substantial number of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ receptors colocalize independently of br ligands . activation of br signaling resulted in significantly elevated colocalizing receptor populations in accordance with the proposed recruitment models for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ heterooligomerization . colocalization is a good indicator for the involvement of proteins in the same biological process . however due to the limited spatial resolution of confocal imaging colocalization analysis can not answer whether two proteins of interest also physically interact a requirement for many signaling events . therefore flim was employed to detect resonance energy transfer between the alexa dye conjugated secondary antibodies used above . the results of the fret flim experiments are presented in figure and show that within bfa compartments _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ ha were indeed in close physical proximity as indicated by a reduction of the _METHOD_ lifetime from to ns . interaction of both receptors was observed in a subset of the intracellular _LOCATION_ compartments in line with the colocalization data . most likely these intracellular _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ heterooligomers originate from endocytosed pm receptor complexes . further validation of the fret flim data using antibody labeling is described in supplemental figure . unfortunately the detection of fret was restricted to bfa compartments that contained sufficient _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ ha receptors . using the immunocytochemical approach it was not possible to obtain reliable photon counts for statistical _METHOD_ lifetime analysis at the pm . to complement the results obtained from immunolabeling also live cell imaging was applied . in figure a to c confocal images of a double transgenic line _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mcherry and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ are shown . as expected both receptors localized to the pm . for _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ vesicular structures similar to those seen in figure were observed . _PROTEIN_ mcherry again showed a more diffuse intracellular localization pattern and localization to the tonoplast was revealed . similar to the findings obtained by immunolabeling _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ colocalized highly at the pm and less so in endomembrane compartments as indicated by the manders colocalization coefficients summarized in table ii . in the presence of endogenous brs about of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and of _PROTEIN_ mcherry receptors colocalized at the pm whereas the intracellular colocalization comprised around and of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ mcherry molecules respectively . depletion of endogenous brs using brz had no observable effect on the localization and hardly affected the colocalization of both receptors . only the intracellular colocalization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ with _PROTEIN_ mcherry slightly increased . activation of br signaling by incubating brz treated seedlings in bl prior to imaging resulted in significantly increased colocalization of the two lrr _PROTEIN_ both at the pm and intracellularly similar to the findings presented in table i . comparative colocalization analysis is shown for live roots of d old arabidopsis seedlings coexpressing _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ mcherry . brz was added to the growth medium d after germination . for ligand stimulation bl was applied for h. colocalizing fractions of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ mcherry are presented as modified manders colocalization coefficients se . additionally pearson correlation coefficients se are given . n represents the number of regions of interest analyzed . for _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ analysis one region of interest included at least three _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ sections . increased pm colocalization was also observed in response to bfa known to stabilize _PROTEIN_ at the pm . as shown in table ii manders colocalization coefficients for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were elevated to and respectively and also an increased pearson correlation coefficient was obtained . in contrast intracellular colocalization of _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . colocalization of both receptors in bfa compartments showed similar values to those obtained for immunolabeled roots and was significantly increased by simultaneous application of bfa and bl . in comparison with bfa treated samples additional bl application did not change pm and intracellular colocalization of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . to summarize quantitative microscopic analysis in live cells confirmed that a large population of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ receptors colocalizes independently of br signaling activity . a smaller yet distinct minority of both receptors is affected by the br signaling status indicated by increased colocalization upon bl and bfa application . to investigate whether and how br signaling influences the heterooligomerization between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ roots of the double transgenic _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ mcherry line were examined using in planta fret flim . the images presented in figure a to d were derived from seedlings heterozygous for _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ to have a more physiological level of the tagged _PROTEIN_ receptor while remaining homozygous for _PROTEIN_ mcherry . after bl stimulation of brz cultured seedlings the amount of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ heterooligomers found after coimmunoprecipitation was significantly increased and amounted to about of the total amount of _PROTEIN_ and about of _PROTEIN_ receptors . a _METHOD_ lifetime image of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in the presence of _PROTEIN_ mcherry after brz and subsequent bl treatment is shown in figure . the color code clearly indicates a nonuniform distribution of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ lifetimes . remarkably small and restricted areas in the pm with a strongly reduced donor _METHOD_ lifetime became visible . the observed strong heterogeneity in the distribution of interacting receptors indicates that a minority of pm located _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ mcherry receptors are in direct physical proximity . a numerical evaluation of the observed _METHOD_ lifetime values and interaction pixels is presented in table iii . corrected ips values represent the percentage of pixels with strongly reduced _METHOD_ _METHOD_ lifetimes and are taken as estimates of the percentage of _PROTEIN_ interacting with _PROTEIN_ . we estimate that about of _PROTEIN_ can be seen as heterooligomers with _PROTEIN_ in the pm of bl stimulated epidermal root cells . this corresponds to an average of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ receptors per confocal section . quantitative analysis is shown for flim measurements performed in planta on roots of d old _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ mcherry _PROTEIN_ seedlings using _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in combination with _PROTEIN_ mcherry as a negative control . endogenous brs were depleted either by _PROTEIN_ or brz treatment . bl was used throughout the experiments . the values given represent mean donor _METHOD_ lifetimes of the _METHOD_ moiety of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in ps se . the values given for ips represent the mean percentage of pixels with strongly reduced bri _METHOD_ _METHOD_ lifetimes se . the corrected ips values were obtained by subtracting the ips values of the negative control from the ips values determined for brz bl treated _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ mcherry . n represents the number of analyzed _METHOD_ lifetime images . to determine whether the depletion of endogenous brs abolishes _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ interactions brz treated seedlings were imaged . the resulting _METHOD_ lifetime image is shown in figure . unexpectedly similar regions with a strong reduction in _METHOD_ lifetime were observed suggesting that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ heterooligomers are preformed in the absence of ligand . numerical analysis showed a reduction in corrected ips of approximately one third suggesting that at strongly reduced ligand concentrations still about of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ receptors or per confocal section are in complex with _PROTEIN_ . this is far more than the single _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ heterooligomer that was expected based on the possibly residual bl concentration after brz treatment . consequently the majority of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ mcherry heterooligomers observed in brz treated roots are formed in the absence of ligand . control experiments using _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ donor _METHOD_ lifetime only revealed small local variations in the lifetime of the fluorophore . to provide an independent estimate of the amount of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ heterooligomers the more potent br biosynthesis inhibitor _PROTEIN_ was employed . the results show that at a much lower concentration of _PROTEIN_ compared with brz seedling growth is more strongly affected . however the number of physically interacting _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ heterooligomers remains the same . to provide an independent biological control _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was employed alone or in combination with _PROTEIN_ mcherry using seedlings cultured in brz or treated with brz and bl . in none of these images were regions in the pm showing a strong reduction in _METHOD_ lifetime observed . to validate our observation that in planta fret flim faithfully reports the number of interacting receptors a number of additional control experiments were performed . the first was to use bfa treated roots where inside the large bfa compartments a similar reduction in _METHOD_ lifetimes was observed to that obtained for the immunolabeling approach . in comparison with wild type _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ mutant elongated showed an increased association with _PROTEIN_ . indeed a slight increase in the association between _PROTEIN_ super cyan _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ super yellow _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ was observed using flim in a transient _PROTEIN_ system . finally the time course of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ heterooligomerization was determined . treatment of brz cultured double transgenic roots with exogenous bl led to a time dependent rise of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ heterooligomers from an uncorrected ips of about to after h . surprisingly a significant increase was only detected after a lag period indicating that the amount of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ heterooligomers is almost stable during the first one half hour of signaling . in summary we conclude that a significant subpopulation of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ form heterogeneously distributed br signaling units within the pm . we propose that these units carry out the initial signaling activity _PROTEIN_ followed by an increase in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ heterooligomers employing a maximum of of _PROTEIN_ present in root epidermal cells .

homozygous _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ mcherry plants . plants were selected on _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and the presence of the transgenes was confirmed by pcr using the primer combinations described above . the double transgenic _PROTEIN_ cerulean line was generated by crossing and seedlings of the generation were used for imaging . for immunoprecipitation of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_

strength murashige and skoog medium supplemented with suc containing bl bfa brz and nm _PROTEIN_ . the seedlings were incubated with inhibitors under regular growth conditions as described above . _PROTEIN_ treatment at a concentration over nm or for more then d resulted in dead seedlings no longer suitable for fret flim analysis . the stock solutions used were mm bl in ethanol mm bfa in _METHOD_ mm brz in ethanol and mm _PROTEIN_ in _METHOD_ . optical sections of immunostained roots were acquired using a confocal laser scanning microscope _PROTEIN_ . was excited using an argon laser and _METHOD_ was detected via a band pass filter . for double stained samples excitation light of nm was used for goat anti rabbit and a helium/neon diode laser was used for goat anti mouse and

channels using previous methods . the obtained modified manders coefficients were used as the fraction of colocalization for both channels _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . besides modified manders coefficients pearson correlation coefficients were obtained as a second measure for colocalization . fret is a photophysical process in which the excited state energy from a _METHOD_ donor molecule is transferred nonradiatively to an acceptor molecule . fret is based on weak dipole dipole coupling and therefore can only occur at molecular distances . there are several methods to quantify and visualize fret of which donor _METHOD_ lifetime imaging is the most straightforward since a _METHOD_ lifetime is a concentration independent property . however _METHOD_ lifetimes are sensitive to the environment which is the basis for fret flim . fret flim experiments consist of measuring donor _METHOD_ lifetimes in the absence and presence of acceptor molecules resulting in spatially resolved color coded lifetime images . observation of a _PROTEIN_ donor _METHOD_ lifetime is used as a readout for molecular interactions . a leica tcs x system equipped with a numeric aperture water immersion objective lens was used for confocal/flim imaging . confocal and flim images were acquired by exciting the respective fluorophores _METHOD_ and using a white light laser . this laser emits a continuous spectrum from to nm within which any individual excitation wavelength in nm increments can be selected . for excitation of _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ a diode laser or the nm line of an argon laser was used respectively . confocal imaging was performed using internal filter free spectral photomultiplier tube detectors . for _METHOD_ detection a spectral window of to nm was selected whereas was detected using to nm . detection of _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ was accomplished using a spectral window of to to nm . confocal images were acquired with pixels . for fret flim experiments a pulsed diode laser or white light laser at a pulsed frequency of mhz was used . for recording of donor _METHOD_ an external fiber output was connected to the leica x scan head and coupled to a hamamatsu hpm hybrid detector which has a time resolution of ps . selection of _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was performed using band pass filters to and to nm respectively . images with a frame size of pixels were acquired with acquisition times of up to s. from the _METHOD_ intensity images the decay curves were calculated per pixel and fitted with either a mono or double exponential decay model using the spcimage software . the monoexponential model function was applied for donor samples with only _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ present . for samples containing two fluorophores _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ a double exponential model function was used without fixing any parameter . to calculate the fraction of ips _METHOD_ intensity and the corresponding _METHOD_ lifetime data for each pixel were exported from spcimage and imported into an excel spreadsheet . the quantification of interacting pixels was set according to the following criteria . the photon counts per pixel must be at least in total using a binning _PROTEIN_ of ensuring a statistically required peak value in the respective photon histogram used for _METHOD_ lifetime calculation . to ensure a reliable fit only pixels with < were selected . additionally _METHOD_ lifetimes below ns and above ns were excluded from the calculation of interacting fractions . the reason for setting these values was to avoid false positive or negative interactions . the total amount of pixels for each _METHOD_ intensity image was set after applying these above mentioned criteria resulting almost exclusively in pixels representing pm or adjacent areas . subsequently the average donor _METHOD_ lifetimes were determined . the individual minimum of a set of measurements was used to calculate the interaction threshold which usually corresponded to a fret efficiency of about . only pixels with _METHOD_ lifetimes below the interaction threshold were collected as ips . the ratio between the ips and the total amount of selected pixels represented the value of ips . arabidopsis mesophyll protoplasts were isolated and transfected as described previously . only the isolation procedure was _PROTEIN_ according to citation . to obtain the asn to asp substitution in the coding sequence of _PROTEIN_ for generating an _PROTEIN_ coding sequence site directed mutagenesis using pcr with primer combination elg forward and elg reverse _PROTEIN_ was performed . introduction of the base change was confirmed by sequencing . statistical analysis was performed using excel software . sequence data from this article can be
