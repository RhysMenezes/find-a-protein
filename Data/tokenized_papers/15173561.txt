the arabidopsis shrunken seed _PROTEIN_ gene encodes a homolog of the _LOCATION_ biogenesis _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and a loss of function mutation in this gene alters seed storage composition . two lines of evidence support a function for _PROTEIN_ in _LOCATION_ biogenesis the peroxisomal localization of a green _METHOD_ protein _PROTEIN_ fusion protein and the lack of normal _LOCATION_ in _PROTEIN_ mutant embryos . the green _METHOD_ protein _PROTEIN_ colocalizes with the red _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ labeled peroxisomal markers _METHOD_ _LOCATION_ targeting signal and _LOCATION_ targeting signal _METHOD_ in transgenic arabidopsis . each peroxisomal marker exhibits a normal punctate peroxisomal distribution in the wild type but not the _PROTEIN_ mutant embryos . further studies reported here were designed toward understanding _PROTEIN_ metabolism in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . a time course study of dissected embryos revealed a dramatic rate _PROTEIN_ in oil accumulation and an increase in starch accumulation . introduction of starch synthesis mutations into the _PROTEIN_ background did not restore oil biosynthesis . this finding demonstrated that reduction in oil content in _PROTEIN_ is not caused by increased _PROTEIN_ flow to starch . to identify the blocked steps in the _PROTEIN_ oil deposition pathway developing _PROTEIN_ seeds were supplied radiolabeled oil synthesis precursors . the ability of _PROTEIN_ to incorporate oleic acid but not pyruvate or acetate into triacylglycerol indicated a defect in the fatty acid biosynthetic pathway in this mutant . taken together the results point to a possible role for _LOCATION_ in the net synthesis of fatty acids in addition to their established function in lipid catabolism . other possible interpretations of the results are discussed .
the _PROTEIN_ coding region was fused in frame to the c terminus of _METHOD_ and placed under the control of cauliflower mosaic virus promoter . agrobacteria carrying this construct were used to infiltrate the flowers of _PROTEIN_ heterozygous plants . fourteen sustainable transgenic lines were generated . of these seven were _PROTEIN_ heterozygous and seven were _PROTEIN_ homozygous lines as indicated by pcr . although these homozygous lines have reduced fertility compared to the wild type plants the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion protein complements both the shrunken seed and the lethal phenotypes of the _PROTEIN_ mutant and is therefore functional . two complemented _PROTEIN_ homozygous lines were randomly selected and cotyledons from young seedlings were observed in a confocal microscope . in both cases organelles containing the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion protein varied in their sizes . the prominent ones were much bigger than expected for _LOCATION_ and their frequencies often did not exceed one per cell . similar distribution of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was also observed in developing embryos from four randomly selected transgenic lines of either _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ genotypes . as revealed in root cells by _METHOD_ microscopy the green _METHOD_ organelles do not match the diamidino phenylindole stained _LOCATION_ and are therefore different structures . unlike the fusion protein _METHOD_ alone was _LOCATION_ as reported previously . overexpression of plant peroxisomal _LOCATION_ proteins has been reported to cause _LOCATION_ clustering . moreover overexpression of in the yeast y. lipolytica resulted in fewer enlarged _LOCATION_ . this result suggested that the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ containing organelles might be peroxisomal aggregates or enlarged _LOCATION_ . most peroxisomal _PROTEIN_ proteins are directed into the organelle through one of two conserved targeting signals _PROTEIN_ located either at the c terminus _PROTEIN_ or at the n terminus _PROTEIN_ . the c terminal amino acids of pumpkin malate synthase contain the _PROTEIN_ signal and are sufficient to direct _PROTEIN_ into _LOCATION_ in arabidopsis . we therefore fused the dna fragment encoding this peptide to the c terminus of red _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . we also fused the predicted _PROTEIN_ sequence from arabidopsis ketoacyl coa thiolase to the n terminus of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . each of these two _METHOD_ labeled peroxisomal markers was introduced into transgenic plants to visualize _LOCATION_ . in young / or _PROTEIN_ seedlings the two _METHOD_ markers revealed numerous _LOCATION_ in each cell . an example of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ distribution in root hair cells is shown in figure . in addition the two _METHOD_ markers allowed visualization of _LOCATION_ in developing arabidopsis embryos _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ where _LOCATION_ had not been previously observed . because transgenic line had _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ labeled organelles in all tissues examined the two peroxisomal markers were introduced separately into this line to test the peroxisomal localization of _PROTEIN_ . in contrast to the normal pattern of _LOCATION_ distribution many cells of line seedlings contained only one enlarged _LOCATION_ per cell as revealed by both _METHOD_ markers . figure shows an example of a single _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ labeled _LOCATION_ in a root hair cell . similarly reduction in number and increase in the average size of _LOCATION_ were also observed in developing embryos of line although the effect in embryo was not as dramatic as in seedling . the distribution of _METHOD_ labeled _LOCATION_ in line resembled that of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and superimposed images of _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ confirmed that _PROTEIN_ colocalizes with each peroxisomal marker . therefore _PROTEIN_ is targeted to _LOCATION_ and overexpression of this protein changes _LOCATION_ distribution . we also used electron microscopy to examine _LOCATION_ in cotyledons and true leaves from young seedlings . in contrast to the typical _LOCATION_ in wild type plants aggregates of approximately _LOCATION_ were found in the em sections from line . frequently neighboring _LOCATION_ were fused to one another . these aggregates are likely the large green _METHOD_ organelles observed by _METHOD_ and confocal microscopy . single _LOCATION_ corresponding to the relatively smaller green _METHOD_ structures were also observed by em . in addition chloroplasts in the transgenic plants appeared to have less organized _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . this might be a consequence of the abnormal peroxisomal distribution as the two organelles are normally closely positioned as they carry out coordinated functions such as photorespiration . the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ labeled _LOCATION_ could be observed in / or _PROTEIN_ embryos by _METHOD_ microscopy . however the _PROTEIN_ mutant embryos from the same _PROTEIN_ lines did not have a detectable _METHOD_ signal . the fusion protein was possibly degraded in the mutant when it was unable to localize to _LOCATION_ . the other marker _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ also demonstrated the lack of normal _LOCATION_ in _PROTEIN_ . in contrast to its punctate distribution pattern in heterozygotes _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ had a diffuse distribution in _PROTEIN_ suggesting that it is located either in the _LOCATION_ or in small structures that may be remnants of _LOCATION_ . the _PROTEIN_ that neither the _PROTEIN_ nor _PROTEIN_ constructs revealed _LOCATION_ indicates that the _PROTEIN_ mutant probably has lost most peroxisomal functions as have yeast and human _PROTEIN_ mutants . _LOCATION_ are also present in mature wild type arabidopsis embryos . although the background _METHOD_ signal became stronger as the embryos matured the signal from the _LOCATION_ was more intense and could easily be recognized . if _LOCATION_ biogenesis occurs during embryogenesis peroxin genes should be _PROTEIN_ in developing seeds . we have shown previously that the _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ gene in whole siliques increases as the seeds mature . in order to measure peroxin gene _PROTEIN_ from seed tissues exclusively seeds from days after fertilization _PROTEIN_ until full maturation were used for gene _PROTEIN_ analysis . the mrna levels of eight peroxin genes were compared among seeds flower buds seedlings and emerging leaves by use of a semiquantitative reverse transcription pcr . these genes were detected in all tissues and for most of them the steady state mrna levels in mature seeds were at least as high as that in developing seeds . in addition all eight genes were strongly _PROTEIN_ in flower buds indicating that high _LOCATION_ activities might be present in this tissue . by contrast the mrna level of leafy cotyledon _PROTEIN_ a global regulator of embryogenesis _PROTEIN_ continuously in seeds after the early cotyledon stage and was barely detectable in seedlings flower buds or leaves . another control gene actin _PROTEIN_ was constitutively _PROTEIN_ in all tissues and developmental stages tested . to understand the reduction of oil content in _PROTEIN_ we compared the time courses of oil accumulation in developing wild type and _PROTEIN_ embryos . because the opposite changes in starch and oil contents in _PROTEIN_ seeds may have a cause and effect relationship we analyzed the time course of starch accumulation as well . embryos of various developmental stages were separated from endosperm and seed coats and those _PROTEIN_ embryos with clear developmental delays were not used . at _PROTEIN_ starch levels were still low in both mutant and the wild type while the _PROTEIN_ mutant already had detectably higher amounts of starch _PROTEIN_ . during the seed filling period _PROTEIN_ accumulated starch at elevated rates and the period of net starch degradation started _PROTEIN_ than in wild type . as a consequence the starch level in the _PROTEIN_ mutant at _PROTEIN_ was much higher than the peak level in the wild type at to _PROTEIN_ . in contrast to starch the oil time course had an opposite trend in _PROTEIN_ . severely reduced oil contents and _PROTEIN_ rates of oil accumulation were observed throughout the seed filling period in _PROTEIN_ . to rule out the possibility that the low rate of oil accumulation in _PROTEIN_ was simply a consequence of increased _PROTEIN_ flux into starch we assessed the effect of abolishing starch synthesis on the production of oil in _PROTEIN_ . as shown in figure although starch accumulation was prevented by introducing the starch synthesis mutants _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ into the _PROTEIN_ background the levels of oil in the _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ double mutants and the _PROTEIN_ single mutant _PROTEIN_ were indistinguishably low less than of that in wild type _PROTEIN_ or col . these results demonstrated that the low rate of oil deposition in _PROTEIN_ was not caused by the increased starch synthesis . indeed the loss of _PROTEIN_ from the oil pool was more striking than the gain of _PROTEIN_ in the starch pool and suc the major _PROTEIN_ source used for the synthesis of both oil and starch accumulated in mature _PROTEIN_ seeds . in order to determine the location of the block in the _PROTEIN_ oil deposition pathway we fed _PROTEIN_ developing embryos radiolabeled oil synthetic precursors and measured their incorporation into oil . the biosynthetic pathways for oil and starch diverge after the synthesis of glc phosphate . conversion of to glc phosphate by the _LOCATION_ phosphoglucomutase commits the _PROTEIN_ flux to starch . _LOCATION_ or _LOCATION_ glycolysis followed by acetyl coa formation in _LOCATION_ on the other hand directs the _PROTEIN_ flux toward fatty acids which are then used to synthesize oil or other lipids . because starch synthesis is elevated in _PROTEIN_ embryos the defect in oil deposition should be downstream of on the oil branch and possibly causes shifted _PROTEIN_ flux toward starch . as expected oil in the _PROTEIN_ embryos incorporated small amounts of label from glc which enters fatty acid biosynthesis upon conversion to by hexokinase . control experiments showed that glc was taken up and incorporated into starch cell wall and proteins in both the wild type and the _PROTEIN_ embryos . pyruvate and acetate which are converted to the downstream precursor acetyl coa by the _LOCATION_ pyruvate dehydrogenase and acetyl coa synthase respectively also failed to support oil synthesis in _PROTEIN_ embryos . however both pyruvate and acetate were taken up and metabolized by the _PROTEIN_ embryos as efficiently as the wild type . in contrast to these results oleic acid was able to support oil synthesis in _PROTEIN_ embryos at rates at least as high as that of the wild type embryos . the capability of _PROTEIN_ to synthesize oil from fatty acids but not acetyl coa suggests impaired fatty acid synthesis . this is likely to be the direct cause of the reduced oil content in _PROTEIN_ seeds . it has been shown previously that plants can incorporate fatty acids into their _LOCATION_ from tween fatty acid esters . to determine whether shortage of fatty acids is also the cause of other developmental defects in _PROTEIN_ we grew _PROTEIN_ seedlings on culture medium supplemented with tween . after being dissected from their seed coats about to of mature _PROTEIN_ embryos could develop into small seedlings . in the absence of exogenous fatty acids the _PROTEIN_ mutant seedlings exhibited little root and shoot growth . the shoot appeared to contain one to three leaf like small structures that failed to expand or turn green . in the presence of tween about of _PROTEIN_ seedlings produced many small green leaves with a water soaked and translucent appearance . elongated roots were sometimes observed in seedlings grown on tween . in the control wild type seedlings tween did not affect seedling growth . thus limited fatty acid synthesis at least partially explains the growth defects of the _PROTEIN_ mutant . the fatty acid composition of triacylglycerols was compared between _PROTEIN_ and wild type seeds . and _PROTEIN_ fatty acid chains as percentage of total fatty acids were similar between _PROTEIN_ and wild type seeds . however _PROTEIN_ seeds exhibited approximately two fold reductions in the saturated fatty acids and and the polyunsaturated fatty acids and but modest increases in the monounsaturated fatty acids and and the polyunsaturated fatty acid . for unknown reasons _PROTEIN_ contained a much higher proportion than wild type seeds of the series of monounsaturated fatty acids . the saturated fatty acid was only and of the total fatty acids in wild type seeds as compared to and respectively in _PROTEIN_ seeds . even though the total amount of fatty acids was reduced approximately seven fold in _PROTEIN_ seeds the levels of and in _PROTEIN_ seeds were close to that in the wild type seeds . fatty acid composition of wild type _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutant seeds the _PROTEIN_ and wild type embryos of various developmental stages were compared . the _PROTEIN_ embryos exhibited an impaired greening process . at _PROTEIN_ torpedo and early cotyledon stages _PROTEIN_ the wild type embryos turned green while _PROTEIN_ embryos stayed yellow white . in a population segregating for approximately of _PROTEIN_ and of _PROTEIN_ genotypes the few green _PROTEIN_ embryos could be distinguished from the _PROTEIN_ majority . in addition _PROTEIN_ embryos exhibited various degrees of developmental delay during early morphogenesis . by _PROTEIN_ most wild type embryos entered _PROTEIN_ torpedo or early cotyledon stage whereas about of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ embryos were still at the early torpedo or heart stage . throughout the seed filling period the developmentally advanced _PROTEIN_ embryos appeared to be smaller than the wild type and this size difference persisted into the mature seed stage . comparison in a transmission light microscope revealed smaller cotyledon areas and thinner hypocotyls in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . both the reduction in storage products and the growth deficiency may restrict _PROTEIN_ embryo expansion .
all seedlings used were grown on petri dishes containing murashige and skoog salt supplemented with minimum organics or suc and agar . when indicated tween was added to . embryos were separated from seed coats under a dissecting microscope with two sterile needles . before dissection seeds were surface sterilized and soaked in water for several hours or overnight . the _PROTEIN_ and wild type control seedlings in figure were incubated in dim light under a h light and h dark cycle . all the other seedlings were grown under continuous light of intensity . the developing seeds were obtained from soil grown plants in a greenhouse where the light cycle varies with the seasons . for construction of the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ double mutants the heterozygous _PROTEIN_ plants were used as paternal parents and the starchless mutants as maternal parents . seedlings were confirmed by their kanamycin resistance and the plants homozygous for the _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ allele and heterozygous for the _PROTEIN_ allele were identified as those individuals that exhibited kanamycin resistance but did not show staining of starch in rosette leaves . the shrunken seeds from these plants are the desired _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ double mutants . a fragment of _PROTEIN_ cdna from the second codon to bp downstream of the stop codon was excised from the cdna clone by hindiii and sspi digestion and blunt ended with klenow . this fragment was cloned into the ecori site of the pegad vector and the _PROTEIN_ coding region was placed downstream to and fused in frame with the _METHOD_ coding region . this is the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ construct . the _METHOD_ gene with human optimized translational codon usage was excised from the _METHOD_ plasmid and cloned between the camv promoter and the nopaline synthase region in a based vector . the resulting plasmid was used to make the two peroxisomal marker constructs . a _PROTEIN_ fragment corresponding to the last amino acids from the pumpkin malate synthase gene was made by annealing the two synthesized primers _PROTEIN_ f and _PROTEIN_ r . the bsrgi and saci sites were added at the n and c termini of _PROTEIN_ f respectively . the _PROTEIN_ fragment was fused to the c terminus of _METHOD_ in to create the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ plasmid . for the construction of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ plasmid the n terminal bp of the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ coding region including the predicted _PROTEIN_ was isolated by rt pcr using primers _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . an xbai and a ncoi site were included in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ respectively . the _PROTEIN_ fragment was ligated with the xbai and ncoi digested and fused in frame to the n terminus of _METHOD_ . the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ cassettes were excised from corresponding plasmids by ecori and hindiii digestion and subsequently cloned into the binary vector between bsteii and hindiii sites resulting in pcamb _METHOD_ and pcamb _METHOD_ respectively . a nikon _METHOD_ microscope or a leica tcsnt confocal microscope was used to observe _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ . for _METHOD_ microscopy the fluorescein isothiocyanate filter sets for _METHOD_ _METHOD_ or dapi stained _LOCATION_ were used . for confocal microscopy a to nm wavelength of excitation and to nm _METHOD_ to nm _METHOD_ or to nm wavelengths of emission were used .

stain the _LOCATION_ . for electron microscopic observation of _LOCATION_ cotyledons or true leaves from young seedlings were cut into to mm squares in paraformaldehyde and glutaraldehyde in m cacodylate buffer . after being prefixed for to h in the same solution and postfixed for h in osmium tetroxide and m cacodylate buffer samples were dehydrated through an ethanol series and imbedded in spurr 's resin . thin sections were stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate before being observed under a transmission electron microscope . in each feeding experiment developing seeds were incubated in of feeding buffer for to h under continuous light . the feeding buffers were mm glc at ci in mm hepes mm pyruvate at ci in mm hepes mm acetate at ci in mm hepes and oleic acid at ci in mm potassium phosphate . extraction and thin layer chromatography separation of triacylglycerol were as described in citation . the amount of isotope incorporated into triacylglycerol was determined by scintillation counting . to determine the amount of precursor taken up by the embryos embryos were rinsed with water and ground before scintillation counting . to determine the amount of precursor incorporated into starch cell wall or protein embryos were rinsed with water and ground in ml ethanol . after min incubation at and centrifugation the unincorporated precursor was removed as the soluble fraction . the pellet was rinsed with another ml ethanol before measuring the amount of incorporated isotope by scintillation counting . fatty acid methyl ester derivatization and extraction was carried out on to seeds or to dissected embryos that were ground in a glass test tube with a glass rod . the ground materials were incubated in a sealed glass vial with ml of n methanolic hcl containing of myristic acid at for h. following the addition of ml each of hexane and nacl the fame was extracted to the hexane phase . the hexane phase was transferred to a tube and concentrated to about under a flow of nitrogen . the fame was quantified by gas chromatographic _METHOD_ _METHOD_ using a series ii gas chromatograph equipped with a supelcowax sp capillary column _PROTEIN_ attached to a hp _METHOD_ spectrometer . the gas chromatograph oven temperature was programmed to be _PROTEIN_ initially at for min then to rise to at with a hold at for min subsequently to rise to at with a hold at for min finally to rise to at with a hold at for min . the carrier gas flow rate was _PROTEIN_ at ml . the quantity of each fatty acid was determined by comparison with the myristic acid internal control . for the starch content assay to seeds or to dissected embryos were homogenized in of ethanol and incubated at for h to dissolve the soluble sugars . after centrifugation the starch containing pellet was rinsed twice with of ethanol . the pellet was vacuum dried and starch was solublized in of n koh for h at . after addition of of n acetic acid and centrifugation of supernatant
