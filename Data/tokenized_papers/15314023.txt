in the arabidopsis root meristem ground tissue stem cell daughters perform an asymmetric division to form endodermis and cortex . the putative transcription _PROTEIN_ scarecrow _PROTEIN_ and shortroot _PROTEIN_ regulate this radial patterning event and the mixed cell fate in scr mutants suggests an atypical role of the _PROTEIN_ gene in asymmetric cell division . here we use a newly developed site specific gene activation/deletion system in which induced clones are positively marked with green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ . using this system we show that _PROTEIN_ acts cell autonomously to control asymmetric cell division within the ground tissue . we provide evidence that _PROTEIN_ gene _PROTEIN_ is under autoregulatory control that _PROTEIN_ limits _PROTEIN_ movement and that transient _PROTEIN_ action is sufficient to separate endodermis and cortex fates by asymmetric cell division .
_PROTEIN_ induces a periclinal division in the daughter of the ground tissue stem cell only but ectopic _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ results in multiple ground tissue layers indicating that limiting _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is a mechanism to prevent continued activation of _PROTEIN_ and additional periclinal ground tissue divisions . yet _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are present in the entire endodermal ground tissue layer . to test whether only certain ground tissue cells are able to perform the periclinal division we investigated their competence to respond to induced _PROTEIN_ gene _PROTEIN_ in the scr null mutant background . we designed a set of two vectors that can be used to generate both activation and deletion clones while positively marking the cells in which recombination has taken place with _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ localized _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . we combined the cre/lox recombination system with the transactivation system . the binary vector contains the recombination cassette consisting of the _PROTEIN_ resistance gene flanked by two direct repeat lox recombination sites . this construction separates and prohibits the constitutive promoter from inducing transcription and transactivating _METHOD_ . the construct harbors the cre recombinase driven by arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ heat shock promoter . to study activation clones the _PROTEIN_ gene is placed under control of the uas promoter in the vector . scr plants harboring a single copy insertion were crossed with scr _PROTEIN_ uscr plants and the resulting seedlings were used to generate _METHOD_ marked gene activation clones upon heat shock induction which can be recorded in the living organism . the earliest time point of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in the columella and root cap tissues was observed after h. up to h after heat shock newly induced clones _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ appeared . _METHOD_ positive _METHOD_ clones were only observed in seedlings subjected to heat shock induction . activation of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in all meristematic scr mutant ground tissue cells can induce a periclinal division . no effects of _PROTEIN_ activation were detected in other tissues nor did _PROTEIN_ activation in cells neighboring the mutant ground tissue have any effect . in addition heat shock alone did not induce any divisions in the ground tissue in scr plants alone or in scr plants harboring either construct . these results show that in the absence of _PROTEIN_ all ground tissue cells are competent to perform a periclinal division as long as they reside in the meristematic zone indicating the necessity for an active mechanism to restrict periclinal division to stem cell daughters . rare periclinal ground tissue divisions do occur in scr null mutants and we investigated whether these divisions can be asymmetric in the absence of _PROTEIN_ . we introduced the _PROTEIN_ promoter driven _LOCATION_ localized _METHOD_ _METHOD_ as a marker for endodermal fate . in the scr mutant there is a low level of _PROTEIN_ from the _PROTEIN_ promoter observed in the mutant ground tissue layer whereas _PROTEIN_ is absent in the _PROTEIN_ region compared with wild type plants . all periclinal divisions observed in scr resulted in the equal distribution and _PROTEIN_ of the pscr _METHOD_ marker over both layers indicative of a symmetric division . in the weaker scr mutant allele which shows additional periclinal ground tissue divisions creating up to three cell files _PROTEIN_ promoter driven _METHOD_ is also equally distributed indicating symmetric divisions although _PROTEIN_ in the inner ground tissue layer is not always strongly _PROTEIN_ . these results indicate that _PROTEIN_ is required for the asymmetry of the periclinal ground tissue division but not for the execution of the division per se . _PROTEIN_ protein can translocate from the stele to the single ground tissue layer in scr mutants indicating that _PROTEIN_ movement from the stele does not require _PROTEIN_ activity . however ectopically _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ moves from the epidermis to the ground tissue in a scr mutant background but not in wild type which suggests a role for _PROTEIN_ in restricting _PROTEIN_ localization . indeed _PROTEIN_ promoter driven _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion protein is present at low levels and is _PROTEIN_ in both ground tissue layers on periclinal divisions observed in scr demonstrating that symmetric division and _PROTEIN_ movement or perdurance beyond a single cell layer occurs in the absence of functional _PROTEIN_ . to determine the asymmetry of the induced periclinal ground tissue divisions in activation clones we again used the pscr _METHOD_ marker . the lines were analyzed using two different confocal microscope settings . in the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ mode _METHOD_ from both _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ are detected whereas in the _METHOD_ mode only _METHOD_ is detected . after induction of _PROTEIN_ pscr _METHOD_ is induced in cells marked by clonally activated _METHOD_ and is equally divided over the inner and outer cells on periclinal division at has . by has pscr _METHOD_ disappears from the outer cell while being strongly _PROTEIN_ in the inner cell matching _PROTEIN_ regulation in ground tissue stem cell daughters . to address whether _PROTEIN_ could act as an extrinsic signal in the ground tissue we investigated the cell autonomy of _PROTEIN_ activation . about of the observed ground tissue clones also contained _METHOD_ cells . sometimes these ground tissue cells revealed weak transient _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . this indicates the formation of _PROTEIN_ clones in which after a single excision in the _PROTEIN_ phase of the cell cycle only one of the two daughter cells receives the recombined chromosome whereas both cells initially received _PROTEIN_ transcript . occasionally periclinally divided _METHOD_ cells occurred apically and basally to _PROTEIN_ clones formed by periclinal division which therefore are clonally unrelated to the activation event and must be nonautonomously induced . in addition nonautonomously induced divisions were found in ground tissue files neighboring _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ ground tissue cells . to examine whether these apparently nonautonomous divisions were caused by _PROTEIN_ movement we replaced _PROTEIN_ with a fully functional _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion gene . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was never observed in nonautonomously induced periclinally divided cells neither before nor following the observed division and hence we found no evidence for _PROTEIN_ movement . in nonautonomously induced periclinal cell divisions the _PROTEIN_ promoter is not activated and the low background pscr _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ is distributed evenly indicating that these periclinal cell divisions are symmetric . cells may respond by periclinal division because of artificially high _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ from the promoter or by movement of the highly _PROTEIN_ protein in the activation clones and therefore a final conclusion on _PROTEIN_ cell autonomy requires the analysis of deletion clones . a similar observation was made in flowers where _PROTEIN_ driven high _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ induced a more extensive rescue of the mutant phenotype compared with _PROTEIN_ clones in mosaic plants suggesting that higher levels of _PROTEIN_ in had limited nonautonomous effects . we next examined the dynamics of pscr _METHOD_ activity in periclinal _PROTEIN_ clones to determine whether _PROTEIN_ is permanently or transiently required to _PROTEIN_ the asymmetry of the division . heat shock activation of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ results in pscr _METHOD_ induction in ground tissue cells that divide periclinally even before _METHOD_ is detected in the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ mode . after the division _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ marked by _METHOD_ _METHOD_ throughout the cells is separated to the outer cells shown in the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ mode . the _METHOD_ detection mode shows that the _LOCATION_ pscr _METHOD_ marker still becomes asymmetrically _PROTEIN_ in inner ground tissue cells that no longer transcribe functional _PROTEIN_ . our results suggest that ground tissue cells divide asymmetrically only if _PROTEIN_ is present in these cells . importantly _PROTEIN_ is only transiently required to promote asymmetry indicating rapid separation of cell fates . our data show that _PROTEIN_ is not exclusively promoting cell division plane rotation in the ground tissue . symmetric periclinal divisions observed in scr mutants show that periclinal division per se is not dependent on _PROTEIN_ presence but the _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in both layers suggests that one role of _PROTEIN_ is to restrict _PROTEIN_ to a single tissue layer that prevents additional periclinal cell divisions and specification of endodermal layers as observed in _PROTEIN_ ectopic _PROTEIN_ studies . to further examine the autonomy of _PROTEIN_ action we tested _PROTEIN_ deletion clones initiated in the ground tissue stem cell whose surrounding cells have near wild type levels of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . for clonal deletion experiments the vector was used to complement the scr mutant by cloning the _PROTEIN_ gene _PROTEIN_ from its own promoter within the recombination cassette _PROTEIN_ and selecting transformants with a single copy insert . subsequent introduction of _PROTEIN_ by crossing reveals the effects of deleting _PROTEIN_ gene activity in heat shock induced _METHOD_ marked clones in a phenotypically wild type plant . three types of clones were observed consisting of mutant ground tissue derived from scr / stem cells attached to either wild type endodermis and cortex or one of the two layers being scr / . optical cross sections also revealed wild type ground tissue files flanking the deletion clones . none of these configurations rescued periclinal divisions in daughters of scr mutant stem cells . thus deletion of _PROTEIN_ from ground tissue stem cells invariably results in a single layered ground tissue typical for the scr mutant phenotype strongly suggesting that _PROTEIN_ at wild type levels acts strictly cell autonomously in periclinal ground tissue division . although the cell autonomy eliminates _PROTEIN_ as a possible top down signal its ability to induce asymmetric periclinal divisions in meristematic ground tissue cells in the absence of mature endodermis and cortex acting as a patterning template effectively rules out the need for top down signaling to pattern the ground tissue . in strong scr mutants _PROTEIN_ from the _PROTEIN_ promoter is absent from the _PROTEIN_ and reduced in the mutant ground tissue which may reflect autoregulatory control of _PROTEIN_ transcription or an indirect effect . _PROTEIN_ deletion clones provide a test for the requirement of _PROTEIN_ activity in _PROTEIN_ its own _PROTEIN_ . upon deletion of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ pscr _METHOD_ in _PROTEIN_ and ground tissue stem cells disappears within has whereas marker _PROTEIN_ in the endodermis remains present . pscr _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ remains absent in the single layered ground tissue originating from the mutant stem cells . in time reduction of pscr _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ occurs in the already formed endodermis within the deletion clone but background levels remain detectable . however _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ is still detected in the _PROTEIN_ and ground tissue cells in scr mutants indicating that the _PROTEIN_ promoter is no longer responsive to _PROTEIN_ . our results indicate that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ and ground tissue stem cells requires its own gene product whereas in maturing ground tissue cells the _PROTEIN_ is locked in a much less responsive state and can be _PROTEIN_ in its absence once the periclinal ground tissue division has occurred . this demonstrates that ground tissue stem cells have intrinsic regulatory circuits different from their daughters . to examine the effect of _PROTEIN_ deletion on asymmetric fate specification we studied the _PROTEIN_ of the independent endodermis and cortex specific transcripts and . the promoters of both genes were fused to _METHOD_ . _METHOD_ is highly _PROTEIN_ in the cortex but excluded from the _PROTEIN_ the ground tissue stem cells and their undivided daughters in wild type whereas it is _PROTEIN_ in the entire single layered mutant ground tissue and _PROTEIN_ in scr roots . _METHOD_ is highly _PROTEIN_ in the endodermis and is excluded from the _PROTEIN_ in wild type whereas it is _PROTEIN_ in the mutant ground tissue and _PROTEIN_ in scr roots . these markers confirm previous data on the mixed identity of the ground tissue layer in scr mutants and reveal a role for _PROTEIN_ in inhibiting and _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ plus ground tissue stem cells respectively . surprisingly both markers are _PROTEIN_ in their respective ground tissue layer in clones containing cells that underwent asymmetric division before _PROTEIN_ deletion . _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ is induced in the single layered ground tissue originating from the scr / stem cells . the endodermis and cortex markers indicate that the _PROTEIN_ mediated asymmetric cell division leads to immediate and stable separation of cell fates . this is in agreement with the transient requirement of _PROTEIN_ for cell fate separation on periclinal ground tissue division observed in activation clones . in analogy with animal _METHOD_ we speculate that such a locking mechanism may be caused by chromatin mediated processes . our results support a model in which _PROTEIN_ functions cell autonomously to induce rotation of cell division plane and asymmetry of division in the ground tissue . one aspect of the model is the strong autoregulatory _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ and ground tissue stem cells versus the _PROTEIN_ postdivision _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in the maturing endodermis . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is induced by _PROTEIN_ in the _PROTEIN_ and elevated in the ground tissue and thereafter autoinduction of _PROTEIN_ becomes the _PROTEIN_ source of gene regulation upon which the _PROTEIN_ promoter appears to be desensitized to _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ in the _PROTEIN_ is required to specify _PROTEIN_ fate and to _PROTEIN_ the surrounding stem cells . in the ground tissue stem cell daughters _PROTEIN_ induces the asymmetric periclinal division . the active _PROTEIN_ prevents this division in the ground tissue stem cells . upon periclinal division _PROTEIN_ causes a rapid separation of endodermis and cortex gene _PROTEIN_ patterns and locks the cells in their respective fates . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in the outer cortex cell is rapidly reduced to ensure a single periclinal ground tissue division . we postulate that during separation of cell fates additional _PROTEIN_ required for the execution of the periclinal division are segregated or degraded from the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ endodermal cells thus preventing repeated periclinal divisions . the function of _PROTEIN_ in the endodermis is to sequester _PROTEIN_ and prevent movement beyond a single cell file thereby preventing the renewed induction of _PROTEIN_ in the cortex which would lead to additional asymmetric divisions . this mechanism effectively limits asymmetric division to ground tissue stem cell daughters . our data suggest an unconventional mechanism for asymmetric cell division in which a cell fate determinant that can be extrinsically provided before division _PROTEIN_ is actively _PROTEIN_ only in one daughter cell by the downstream effectors of a transcription _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ that is under its control . _PROTEIN_ effectors must rapidly regulate rotation of cell division plane and segregation of unknown _PROTEIN_ that influence both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ oppositely in each daughter cell . regulators of _PROTEIN_ movement and stability and proteins that can influence positioning of the cell plate and asymmetric segregation of _PROTEIN_ should be among these effectors . analysis of suppressors and enhancers of the scr phenotype and molecular approaches to identify _PROTEIN_ target genes should reveal the identity of proteins contributing to the complex control of asymmetric cell division in the ground tissue .
