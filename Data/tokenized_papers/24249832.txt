autophagy is a well defined catabolic mechanism whereby cytoplasmic materials are engulfed into a structure termed the autophagosome . in plants little is known about the underlying mechanism of autophagosome formation . in this study we report that domain _PROTEIN_ a bin amphiphysin rvs domain containing protein translocates to the phagophore assembly site/preautophagosome structure _PROTEIN_ upon autophagy induction and actively participates in the _LOCATION_ deformation process . using the green _METHOD_ protein fusion as a reporter we found that the _PROTEIN_ develops from a cup shaped isolation _LOCATION_ or _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ derived omegasome like structures . using an inducible rna interference approach we show that rnai knockdown of is developmentally lethal and significantly suppresses autophagosome formation . an in vitro _LOCATION_ binding assay demonstrates that is a _LOCATION_ associated protein that binds to phosphatidylinositol phosphate . may facilitate _LOCATION_ expansion or maturation in coordination with the phosphatidylinositol kinase _PROTEIN_ complex during autophagy as promotes _PROTEIN_ foci formation while _PROTEIN_ inhibitor treatment inhibits from translocating to autophagosomes . further interaction analysis shows that associates with the _PROTEIN_ complex and interacts with _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis thaliana whereby may mediate autophagy . thus our study has identified as a novel regulator of autophagy and provided a conserved model for autophagosome biogenesis in arabidopsis .
previous studies identified three domain containing proteins in arabidopsis and . structural analysis revealed that the three proteins also contain an n terminal bar domain . such structural features are found in endophilins a well known _LOCATION_ associated protein family that actively participates in clathrin dependent endocytosis . sequence alignment analysis revealed that shares significant similarities to and with amino acid identities of and respectively . however and but not have been reported to interact with endocytic partners indicating that might function in other pathway . interestingly in mammalian cells bif in contrast with other endophilin subfamily members has been shown to play a role in autophagy . to test for a possible role of in autophagy in plants we first generated transgenic arabidopsis plants _PROTEIN_ green _METHOD_ protein tagged _METHOD_ driven by a ubiquitin promoter and examined the subcellular distribution of _METHOD_ after autophagy induction . benzo thiadiazole _PROTEIN_ acid s methyl ester a salicylic acid agonist that triggers the autophagic pathway in arabidopsis was applied to transgenic _METHOD_ plants . as shown in figure _METHOD_ largely translocated from the _LOCATION_ to numerous punctate compartments after h of bth treatment . in addition treatment with concanamycin a a v _PROTEIN_ inhibitor greatly increased the number of _METHOD_ punctae in the _LOCATION_ . since conc a treatment leads to _LOCATION_ deacidification and prevents the degradation of autophagic bodies in the _LOCATION_ these results indicate that _METHOD_ is in the autophagic pathway in arabidopsis . to confirm the autophagic response of we next tested if _METHOD_ is sensitive to n starvation another well defined condition for autophagy induction . indeed the population of _METHOD_ positive compartments was greatly increased in transgenic _METHOD_ plants subjected to n starvation and even more when n starvation was combined with conc a treatment . further time course analysis showed that autophagy induction by bth is more pronounced than that of n starvation treatment . taken together these results demonstrate that _METHOD_ indeed lies on the autophagic pathway in arabidopsis . to find out if _METHOD_ functions as endogenous in autophagy in arabidopsis we next generated antibodies specific to and _PROTEIN_ an accepted autophagosome marker in plants . immunoblot analysis using proteins isolated from either arabidopsis wild type or transgenic _METHOD_ or yellow _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ plants showed that the and _PROTEIN_ antibodies specifically recognized the endogenous as well as the _METHOD_ fusion proteins . in addition _PROTEIN_ antibodies also recognized the _PROTEIN_ isoform . further _METHOD_ labeling studies using transgenic _METHOD_ plants showed that signals of antibody labeling were largely colocalized with _METHOD_ before or after bth treatments demonstrating the high specificity of the antibodies . similarly signals of _PROTEIN_ antibodies overlapped with those of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ transgenic plants . in addition in cells subjected autophagy induction most of the _METHOD_ punctae colocalized with the _METHOD_ signals from _PROTEIN_ antibodies confirming that the punctae are indeed autophagosomes or related structures . since the punctae did not fully overlap with the anti _PROTEIN_ signals and _PROTEIN_ is believed to be a _PROTEIN_ autophagosome marker the distinct foci might represent autophagosome precursors . such a scenario was therefore tested in the following experiments . to verify the autophagosomal nature of the positive compartments we performed colocalization studies using arabidopsis protoplasts transiently coexpressing _METHOD_ _METHOD_ with several known components of core autophagy machinery . these included the _PROTEIN_ complex _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ complex _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ conjugate system _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . as shown in figure _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ punctae largely colocalized with _METHOD_ whereas the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ dots only partially overlapped with _METHOD_ punctae . in addition the dots and _PROTEIN_ like structures defined by both _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ perfectly overlapped with _METHOD_ particularly on the _LOCATION_ but not in the lumen thus excluding the possibility that _METHOD_ is sequestered into the autophagosome lumen as cargo . by contrast as shown in supplemental figure online _METHOD_ positive punctae were distinct from most endomembrane organelle markers including manimannan endo _METHOD_ _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ _LOCATION_ sorting receptor and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ . taken together these results demonstrate that both fusions and native proteins are characteristic of autophagosome related structures in arabidopsis . a general model for autophagosome formation in yeast and mammalian cells involves a series of morphological steps beginning with the initiation of _PROTEIN_ expansion of the autophagosome _LOCATION_ maturation of the autophagosome by cargo sequestration and completion of the double _LOCATION_ . however there are only limited evidences for this model in plant cells . _METHOD_ signals were shown to translocate onto the autophagosome _LOCATION_ upon autophagy induction in arabidopsis cells indicating its involvement in _LOCATION_ progression of autophagosome formation . we thus hypothesized that the dynamics of positive structure formation in arabidopsis generally reflects autophagosome biogenesis in plants which can be observed and traced by time lapse imaging of _METHOD_ in transgenic plants subjected to autophagy induction . indeed _METHOD_ first accumulated on a tubular like structure _LOCATION_ and gradually expanded into a cup shaped structure at min s . after min the isolation _LOCATION_ sealed into a complete _PROTEIN_ like compartment followed by the appearance of two _PROTEIN_ like structures at min s. at the same time another dot appeared which ultimately form a _PROTEIN_ like structure . interestingly a protruding tail like tube headed by a _METHOD_ spot was often observed and likely represents developing autophagosomes for cargo sequestration . we next performed immunogold em studies to elucidate the ultrastructure of _METHOD_ positive compartments . transgenic _METHOD_ arabidopsis plants were first subjected to autophagy induction followed by sample fixation processing via high pressure freezing/freeze substitution and subsequent immunogold labeling using antibodies . examples representing the autophagosome formation steps were identified the isolation _LOCATION_ the cup shape structure the encircling compartment and the completed double _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ like structure . the diameters of these positive structures ranged from to nm while predominantly localized to the _LOCATION_ surfaces . similar results were obtained using _METHOD_ antibodies . positive structures with multiple _LOCATION_ layers were also observed which seemed to undergo a similar expansion and maturation process to form a multiple layer compartment . in addition amphisome like structures with fusion events were also found to be labeled by antibodies . interestingly some of the positive structures were large and contained a long protruding _LOCATION_ that engulfed organelle cargos . we believe that these compartments correspond to the tubular structures observed under confocal microscopy . to verify that the labeled structures detected in arabidopsis are indeed autophagosomes we performed double immunogold labeling using both and _PROTEIN_ antibodies in transgenic _METHOD_ plants after autophagy induction . as shown in figure was predominantly detected on the _LOCATION_ of the bi/multilayered structures while _PROTEIN_ was dispersed . these results are consistent with the previous confocal observations and further support the notion that the _METHOD_ punctae were indeed autophagosomes or related structures . a consistent result was also obtained in double transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and a known autophagosome marker _PROTEIN_ . as shown in figure after autophagy induction the mcherry _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ like or tubular structures were seen to largely overlap with the _METHOD_ signals in the double transgenic plants . taken together these results confirm that translocates onto the autophagosome _LOCATION_ during autophagy and defines a conserved autophagosome formation process in arabidopsis . in yeast and mammalian cells an _LOCATION_ derived and _PROTEIN_ enriched structure named the omegasome has been reported to contribute to the generation of the _PROTEIN_ . interestingly we also observed a proportion of the preautophagosomal structures exhibited _LOCATION_ fragments on both the outside and inside _LOCATION_ surfaces . in some cases isolation _LOCATION_ labeled by seemed to be derived from the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ with evident ribosomes . these observations were further supported by double immunogold labeling using calnexin _LOCATION_ and antibodies which showed their colocalization on the same autophagosome structures . consistently in the _METHOD_ mcherry double transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ like structures positively labeled by _METHOD_ were found to overlap largely with the _LOCATION_ mcherry signals proximally on the _LOCATION_ but not in the lumen during autophagy . since the _LOCATION_ network is the major source of _LOCATION_ in the cell plants might use the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ as a platform for acute proliferation of autophagosomes . however other _LOCATION_ sources may be needed to generate the _PROTEIN_ because some of the _METHOD_ positive autophagosome structures did not exhibit a direct connection to the _LOCATION_ . we next used a loss of function approach to gain an insight into the role of in autophagy in arabidopsis . we failed to obtain a t dna insertional knockout mutant of . alternatively we employed a hairpin rnai knockdown method to generate transgenic arabidopsis plants _PROTEIN_ hairpin rnai for under the control of the constitutive promoter . immunoblot analysis confirmed that this rnai construct is specific for . however we failed to obtain a rnai knockdown plant under the control of the promoter . instead we used the dexamethasone inducible promoter to drive the hairpin rnai fragment against and generated the dex rnai plants . when triggered with dex dex rnai plants were arrested soon after germination and exhibited abnormal root growth . rt pcr analysis confirmed that transcription was downregulated upon dex induction in transgenic plants when compared with the wild type . line was used for testing the optimal silencing conditions for further examination in the knockdown background . time course tracing experiments showed that an abnormal phenotype in dex rnai started to appear from d after dex induction . rt pcr analysis confirmed that the transcription level was significantly downregulated after a d dex induction . at day after dex induction dex rnai plants exhibited early leaf senescence and abnormal root development whereas the wild type plants remained normal . we thus used d old dex rnai seedlings d after dex induction for subsequent analyses . to monitor the fate of autophagy in the knockdown background we crossed the transgenic plant _PROTEIN_ the autophagosome marker _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ with the dex rnai plant and induced autophagy with n starvation . as shown in figure in the absence of dex treatment autophagy was induced with the progressive detection of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ punctae and enhanced _METHOD_ signal in the _LOCATION_ after n starvation whereas additional conc a treatment caused numerous autophagic bodies to accumulate . however upon dex induction _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ degradation was suppressed during n starvation with fewer autophagic bodies forming within the _LOCATION_ even in the presence of conc a . consistent results were obtained in an em analysis . as shown in figure autophagic bodies accumulated within the _LOCATION_ of cells subjected to n starvation and conc a treatment but not in control cells pretreated with dex . immunoblot analysis was performed to measure the autophagic flux by examining the turnover ratio of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and free _METHOD_ . as shown in figure when ubq _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ rnai plants were subjected to n starvation without dex induction the amount of free _METHOD_ increased whereas _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ which represents the normal processed degradation of autophagosomes in the _LOCATION_ . however upon dex induction a significant delay in autophagy flux was detected as indicated by the enhanced _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ signals but without a significant increase in _METHOD_ signals . in addition small _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ positive punctae/tubules instead of _PROTEIN_ like structures accumulated within the cells after dex induction suggesting that is not required for the recruitment of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ to the autophagosome _LOCATION_ . to distinguish whether functions before or after the completion of autophagosome formation we examined the _PROTEIN_ conversion rate in dex rnai plants using _PROTEIN_ antibodies . generally upon autophagy induction an enhanced flux can be detected as the total amount of _PROTEIN_ pe is increased while the _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ form _PROTEIN_ . surprisingly the _PROTEIN_ levels of _PROTEIN_ pe and _PROTEIN_ were remarkably increased after the suppression of implying that autophagosome expansion and/or maturation step may be impaired in which _PROTEIN_ pe has already conjugated onto the autophagosome _LOCATION_ but is unable to be completed or delivered into the _LOCATION_ . similar results were obtained in identical experiments when bth was used to induce autophagy . therefore it is likely that is required for the autophagosome expansion and/or maturation step . since contains a bar domain which is a well known _LOCATION_ binding module for _LOCATION_ deformation we propose that binds to the autophagosome _LOCATION_ by itself to facilitate the expansion or fusion of autophagosome . therefore we next performed an in vitro liposome binding assay to test its _LOCATION_ binding capability . indeed as shown in figure his maltose binding protein recombinant proteins bind to liposomes whereas the control his mbp proteins showed little binding . to determine which lipid binds to we next performed an in vitro lipid binding assay . as shown in figure recombinant proteins bind to phosphatidylinositol phosphates _PROTEIN_ especially _PROTEIN_ whereas no signal was detected in the control with the his mbp proteins . in addition as shown in supplemental figure _METHOD_ positive punctae largely overlap with the _PROTEIN_ reporter _METHOD_ further confirming that is able to bind to _PROTEIN_ . a conserved _PROTEIN_ activity is essential for autophagy in plants as silencing of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ has been shown to limit cell death and reduce autophagosome formation in arabidopsis and nicotiana benthamiana plants . when _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was coexpressed with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ we observed an enhanced production of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ positive punctae that colocalized with _METHOD_ . however when was anchored onto the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ by fusion with the _LOCATION_ retention signal of calnexin the number of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ positive punctae was significantly reduced . on the other hand treatment with wortmannin a _PROTEIN_ inhibitor blocking autophagy resulted in a significant reduction of _METHOD_ and foci formation during autophagy implying that is sensitive to wortmannin and requires _PROTEIN_ activity to function in autophagy . to better understand the molecular links between and the autophagy machinery we searched for its interaction partner . both yeast two hybrid and immunoprecipitation assays showed that has a strong self interaction via its bar domain a result consistent with the known dimerization property of bar domains . moreover we showed that was immunoprecipitated with _PROTEIN_ while no significant interaction was detected in the yeast two hybrid assay . these results indicate that is associated with the _PROTEIN_ complex via other potential mediator . interestingly it was implied that interacts with _PROTEIN_ based on the results of a yeast two hybrid assay . indeed we showed that interacted with both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in our yeast two hybrid assay . these interactions were confirmed by an in vivo coimmunoprecipitation analysis using epitope tagged and _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ respectively . in addition endogenous was precipitated with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in transgenic arabidopsis plants after autophagy induction . intriguingly this interaction _METHOD_ to be mediated by the domain of .
