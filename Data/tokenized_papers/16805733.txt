higher plant cells exhibit interphase microtubule arrays specific to plants which are essential for their developmental program . these cortical microtubules consist of a population of highly dynamic microtubules that are usually organized into bundles in the cortex of the cells . the organization of cmt is intimately linked to the acquisition of specialized functions and subsequentchanges in their distribution affect their properties . the _METHOD_ underlying the formation and the distribution of cmt are still unclear and little is known about the proteins that are involved in this phenomenon . here we investigated the putative role of _PROTEIN_ the only known plant microtubule severing protein in the organization of cmt . we generated transgenic arabidopsis lines that overexpress _PROTEIN_ under the control of an ethanol inducible promoter . in response to an induced overexpression of _PROTEIN_ cmt organized into numerous and _PROTEIN_ bundles which ultimately depolymerized . from the analyses of cmt patterns together with recent data on cmt dynamics we propose that in interphase cells _PROTEIN_ 's _PROTEIN_ activity is to free cmt generating motile microtubules that incorporate into bundles .
in an effort to elucidate the functions of _PROTEIN_ in vivo we produced transgenic arabidopsis thaliana plants that overexpress _PROTEIN_ . to temporally control the _PROTEIN_ of the transgene and to avoid potential deleterious effects of a constitutive overexpression of _PROTEIN_ we used an ethanol inducible _PROTEIN_ system . to directly visualize the effects of _PROTEIN_ on microtubules we introduced _PROTEIN_ cdna in arabidopsis plants that stably overexpressed the microtubule marker mbd fused to the green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ . in arabidopsis cells this reporter fusion protein decorates cmt without interfering with microtubule organization . mbd _METHOD_ plants were transformed either with _PROTEIN_ in fusion with the monomeric red _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or with the reporter _METHOD_ alone as a control _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . several independent arabidopsis lines were selected for each transgene . in the rest of this paper plants _PROTEIN_ ethanol inducible _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ are referred as _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ plants and plants _PROTEIN_ ethanol inducible _METHOD_ are referred to as control plants . the induction of the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in transgenic arabidopsis seedlings was verified by western blot using a polyclonal antibody directed against the n terminal domain of _PROTEIN_ . after or days in the presence of ethanol vapor _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ plants accumulated a large polypeptide with an apparent molecular weight of kda that corresponds to _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . in contrast this polypeptide was not detected in induced control plants in which anti _PROTEIN_ antibodies detected a unique protein of an apparent molecular weight of kda corresponding to the endogenous _PROTEIN_ . in protein extracts of induced _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ plants we sometimes observed an additional kda band that probably corresponds to a degradation product of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion . as plants can produce ethanol during fermentation we verified that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ plants left for or days in a closed culture chamber with water instead of ethanol did not _PROTEIN_ the transgene . these data demonstrate that growth of _PROTEIN_ alca _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgenic plants for h in the presence of ethanol vapor specifically triggered the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . as there are no available antibodies directed against _METHOD_ the induction of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in control plants could not be evaluated using western blotting . so we used confocal microscopy to verify that _METHOD_ accumulated in control plants after ethanol treatment . after days of induction with ethanol vapor the plants did not present any apparent defects in their morphology . to investigate the functions of _PROTEIN_ at the cellular level we analyzed the effects of induced _PROTEIN_ overexpression on the organization of microtubules as revealed by the reporter protein mbd _METHOD_ . seven day old _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ transgenic seedlings bearing two cotyledons were grown for h in the presence of ethanol vapor . the organization of cmt in these plants was observed using confocal microscopy . we first examined the organization of microtubules in cotyledon epidermal cells . in control cells grown for and h with ethanol vapor a dense network of microtubules was distributed throughout the cortex whereas overexpression of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ dramatically altered the microtubule arrays of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ cells . to precisely evaluate the disorganization of cmt in response to _PROTEIN_ overexpression we classified all the cells we observed as in four _PROTEIN_ states depending on the organization of their microtubules . state i corresponds to cells whose microtubule organization could not be distinguished from that observed in mbd _METHOD_ arabidopsis cells . as shown in figure this microtubule organization was very frequently observed in induced control plants but was hardly observed in _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ induced plants . this result shows that the ethanol treatment we used did not disturb the organization of microtubules in itself . states ii iii and iv describe cells whose microtubule arrays were disorganized . cells in state ii contained cmt and few _PROTEIN_ microtubule bundles . in state iii cells we observed only short microtubule bundles spreading within the cortex . the state iv cells contained very few short microtubules if any . quantitative analysis reveals that h after induction nearly all cells overexpressing _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ plants had altered microtubule arrays with of the cells in state ii in state iii and in state iv . prolonged induction for h caused a greater destabilization of microtubules with of cells in state ii in state iii and in state iv . from these data we conclude that the activity of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ leads to destabilization of the microtubule arrays . using confocal microscopy we were not able to detect _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in induced cells although _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was overexpressed in these cells as verified on western blots . because _METHOD_ has a low _METHOD_ quantum yield our inability to observe _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ may be due to the _PROTEIN_ that the protein did not accumulate on microtubules so that it could have been detected . in stomatal cells of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ plants destabilization of the microtubule arrays _PROTEIN_ occurred h after induction . we observed two populations of guard cells in which microtubule organization was disturbed . the first group of cells contained long cmt that were radially oriented together with microtubules arranged in bright and short structures that resembled bundles . in the second group of cells all microtubules were organized into very short bundles . in control plants grown for or h in the presence of ethanol vapor hypocotyl epidermal cells were rectangular . in most cells cmt were organized into long and oblique bundles . these cells were very similar to the epidermal hypocotyl cells of mbd _METHOD_ arabidopsis plants confirming our previous observation that the ethanol treatment we used did not perturb the organization of cmt . in contrast in _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ plants induced for h hypocotyl epidermal cells had a tapered shape . a closer look into the cells revealed that they contained a destabilized and disorganized cortical microtubule array . at h after ethanol induction of hypocotyl cells overexpressing _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ contained _PROTEIN_ microtubule bundles together with long and oblique cmt . the disorganization of cmt was more pronounced h after ethanol induction . at that time only of the hypocotyl cells were in state ii whereas of cells contained few fragmentated microtubules and _PROTEIN_ microtubule bundles and of cells contained very short microtubule bundles . in conclusion quantitative analysis of the organization of cmt over time in leaf and hypocotyl epidermal cells shows that in a first step overexpression of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ favored the formation of microtubule bundles . these bundles were then gradually shortened until the total disappearance of the microtubules .
