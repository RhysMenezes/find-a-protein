_PROTEIN_ and are members of the smh protein family which comprises double stranded dna binding proteins that are specific to higher plants . they are structurally conserved containing a myb domain at the n terminus a central like domain and a c terminally located coiled coil domain . _PROTEIN_ and interact through their myb domain specifically with telomeric double stranded dna in vitro while the central like domain interacts non specifically with dna sequences and mediates protein protein interactions . here we show that _PROTEIN_ and preferentially localize to the _LOCATION_ and nucleolus during interphase . both the central like domain and the myb domain from _PROTEIN_ can direct a _METHOD_ fusion protein to the _LOCATION_ and nucleolus . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ localization is cell cycle regulated as the level of _LOCATION_ associated _METHOD_ diminishes during mitotic entry and _METHOD_ progressively re associates with chromatin during anaphase/telophase . using _METHOD_ recovery after photobleaching and _METHOD_ loss in photobleaching we determined the dynamics of _PROTEIN_ interactions in vivo . the results reveal that _PROTEIN_ interaction with chromatin is regulated at two levels at least one of which is coupled with cell cycle progression with the other involving rapid exchange .
to determine the subcellular localization of attrb proteins we produced translational fusions of _PROTEIN_ and in which the _METHOD_ cdna was fused to the end of the attrb cdna and _PROTEIN_ under the control of the constitutive promoter _METHOD_ . these constructs were transiently transformed into arabidopsis thaliana col cells . surprisingly all three fusion proteins preferentially localized to the nucleolus . only a small proportion of the signal was more generally distributed throughout the _LOCATION_ and formed speckles of various sizes in most cells . _METHOD_ attrb fusion proteins also labelled the cytoplasm weakly and were less concentrated in a region at the centre of the nucleolus probably corresponding to the nucleolar cavity . speckle like structures were not present in stably transformed by calli or a. thaliana plants in which the level of protein _PROTEIN_ tends to be lower than after transient transformation even when _PROTEIN_ is driven by the promoter . the preferential nucleolar localization was observed in all tissues . to confirm these results _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ under the control of the native _PROTEIN_ promoter was tested the localization of the protein was the same as that found using the _PROTEIN_ system although the _PROTEIN_ level was lower . to confirm that the structures to which _PROTEIN_ localized did indeed correspond to nucleoli we co transformed arabidopsis cells with the nucleolar marker fibrillarin fused to _METHOD_ . fibrillarin is a methyl transferase involved in pre rrna processing and ribosome assembly and has been shown to be present in the nucleolus and in cajal bodies in mammals yeast and plants . the clear and consistent co localization between _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and fibrillarin _METHOD_ confirmed that the larger spherical bodies corresponded to nucleoli . in many cases more than one nucleolus was present in the cell and we confirmed this by dapi staining on isolated _LOCATION_ . cultured cells have a variable ploidy which could explain the variable number of nucleoli per cell . the number of nucleoli also varies through interphase _PROTEIN_ as interphase progresses . other smaller _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ labelled bodies were also present throughout the _LOCATION_ . judging by their size and location these bodies are unlikely to represent telomeres and are more likely to be other _LOCATION_ bodies such as cajal bodies or speckles . to investigate the identity of these other bodies in the _LOCATION_ we used _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ markers which define cajal bodies and splicing speckles respectively . however we did not find consistent co localization between these _PROTEIN_ suggesting that the smaller labelled bodies are neither cajal bodies nor speckles . to examine the telomeric localization of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ isolated from stably transformed a. thaliana cultures were subjected to _METHOD_ using anti _METHOD_ antibody combined with telomere fish . fixation and immunological detection revealed a more speckled pattern of _METHOD_ attrb than observed in living cells but the speckles were distributed in the _LOCATION_ and nucleolus in a similar pattern to the native _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ signals . however in contrast to living cells isolated _LOCATION_ after fixation and immunodetection lose the preferential nucleolar localization of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . co localization of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ with telomeric foci was observed in out of foci examined on optical z sections . as a clear localization of _PROTEIN_ to the nucleolus was observed in living cells we addressed the question of which part of the protein is responsible . psort prediction indicates a potential _LOCATION_ localization signal at amino acid position located at the end of the histone like domain . we split _PROTEIN_ into three parts based on the predicted domains cloned these fragments to produce _METHOD_ fusion proteins and transiently _PROTEIN_ them in cell cultures . the myb domain fused to _METHOD_ showed strong general _LOCATION_ signal with some nucleolar localization . significant cytoplasmic signal was also detected . the histone like domain alone or in combination with the myb domain produced a more discrete nucleolar signal with reduced general _LOCATION_ signal and no detectable cytoplasmic signal . the coiled coil domain was localized throughout the cell with a pattern similar to that of free _METHOD_ although there was some variability in _LOCATION_ signal out of cells showed _LOCATION_ signal but the signal was excluded from the _LOCATION_ in five cells . we conclude that the centrally located globular histone like domain is sufficient for nucleolar localization but the myb domain also contributes . to study the behaviour of _PROTEIN_ during the cell cycle we transformed arabidopsis plants with _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . the localization of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in plants corresponded to that found in the cultured cells with most signal concentrated in the nucleolus and weaker signal in the _LOCATION_ and cytoplasm . one notable difference from the arabidopsis suspension cells was that extra nucleolar bodies were not detected . the _METHOD_ signal in plants was much weaker in comparison to that seen in cultured cells suggesting a lower level of _PROTEIN_ . the protein localization was quite consistent without any significant differences among interphase cells . however time lapse microscopy of day old seedlings revealed that _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ localization changes during mitosis . as _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ protein is located in the nucleolus we used this as a marker of _PROTEIN_ cells and selected cells with enlarged nucleoli for the time lapse microscopy . the level of _LOCATION_ associated _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ progressively _PROTEIN_ and became more dispersed as the cell entered mitosis suggesting that re distribution to the cytoplasm is a consequence of _LOCATION_ envelope breakdown and nucleolar disassembly . during the subsequent stages of mitosis the _METHOD_ level stabilized followed by a slow increase during anaphase and telophase . the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ signal during mitosis is largely restricted to the region containing the mitotic chromosomes . the proportion of fusion protein that remained associated with chromatin during mitosis was quite low _METHOD_ but it is important to consider that overall sample bleaching is relatively high in such a long run time lapse experiment _METHOD_ and this generally has a greater effect on weak dispersed signals than on concentrated intense ones . in early anaphase the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ level was progressively restored and re localized to the nucleolus after cytokinesis and phragmoplast formation . to examine the dynamics of _PROTEIN_ in interphase we used flip and frap to follow protein movement . as the majority of _PROTEIN_ was detected in the nucleolus with a weaker signal in the _LOCATION_ we measured frap and flip for the two _PROTEIN_ compartments _LOCATION_ separately . three day old seedlings of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ transformed plants were used for in vivo experiments and a special biochamber with a gas permeable biomembrane was used to observe plants under physiological conditions . we compared acquired frap values of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ dynamics with those for _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ which were used as experimental controls . to examine the mobility potential and _LOCATION_ nucleolus exchange rate of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ we used flip in which an entire region is repeatedly bleached over time and the consequent _PROTEIN_ in _METHOD_ of adjacent regions is measured . for _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was lost from both the nucleolus as well as the nucleoplasm when the nucleolar region was bleached . as most of the signal is concentrated in the nucleolus flip is much faster when the nucleolus is continuously bleached . when an identically sized region in the _LOCATION_ was bleached over the same number of time points the _METHOD_ in the nucleolus and adjacent _LOCATION_ regions was not depleted completely . however by increasing either the number of scans or the size of the bleached region the _METHOD_ intensity dropped to the level of background after _LOCATION_ bleaching . as a control plants _PROTEIN_ free _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ were also subjected to flip . in the case of free _METHOD_ the _METHOD_ dropped to the background level independently of the region selected . thus free _METHOD_ located in the _LOCATION_ and the cytoplasm was freely mobile among these compartments . approximately of _METHOD_ remained tightly bound to the chromatin as expected . these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ is a mobile protein with a high exchange rate between the _LOCATION_ and nucleolus and that it is less stably bound to the chromatin than is . we used frap to investigate the dynamics of _PROTEIN_ further . we recently investigated the dna binding properties of this protein in vitro but the dynamics of this interaction have not previously been investigated in vivo . in frap a region is briefly bleached by intense laser power and the recovery of _METHOD_ over the subsequent time period provides a measure of the rate at which the bleached protein is replaced dynamically by unbleached protein . stably bound proteins such as histones recover slowly over several hours and only to levels of . in contrast _PROTEIN_ proteins transcription and splicing _PROTEIN_ are highly dynamic and recover to nearly within minutes or seconds . in the structure of _PROTEIN_ two conserved domains appear to have distinct functions that may influence protein dynamics in the two major cellular compartments the _LOCATION_ and nucleolus in which _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ localizes . we measured frap for the _LOCATION_ and nucleolus of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plants separately . we found that _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ recovered in both compartments in a similar manner with a of < sec and time required for full recovery _METHOD_ of sec . as experimental controls we used free _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ . the recovery parameters for free _METHOD_ were slightly faster than _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ which is consistent with a higher diffusion rate for free _METHOD_ . using the same settings and a region of the same size the _METHOD_ intensity at the bleaching point dropped to approximately of the initial _METHOD_ intensity in the nucleolus of _PROTEIN_ while the free _METHOD_ bleaching was much less efficient with only a _METHOD_ intensity _PROTEIN_ . this effect can be explained by the fast return of free _METHOD_ molecules to the region of bleaching by rapid diffusion . the relationship between bleaching efficiency and protein mobility was clearly demonstrated by the _PROTEIN_ that _METHOD_ could be bleached to as low as of initial _METHOD_ . is a tightly bound molecule that recovered to only approximately within the time frame of this short experiment . when the samples were subjected to fixation by formaldehyde the mobility of both free _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ was abolished . thus we conclude that _PROTEIN_ protein is highly dynamic and its association with both _LOCATION_ compartments _METHOD_ to involve fast protein exchange .
