trafficking of secretory proteins between the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and the _LOCATION_ apparatus depends on coat protein complexes i _PROTEIN_ and ii _PROTEIN_ machineries . to date full characterization of the distribution and dynamics of these machineries in plant cells remains elusive . furthermore except for a presumed linkage between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ for the _PROTEIN_ of _LOCATION_ protein export the _METHOD_ by which _PROTEIN_ influences _PROTEIN_ mediated protein transport from the _LOCATION_ in plant cells are largely uncharacterized . here we dissect the dynamics of _PROTEIN_ in intact cells using live cell imaging and _METHOD_ recovery after photobleaching analyses to provide insights into the distribution of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ machineries and the _METHOD_ by which _PROTEIN_ influences _PROTEIN_ mediated protein export from the _LOCATION_ . we found that _PROTEIN_ and coatomer are dynamically associated with the _LOCATION_ apparatus and that the _PROTEIN_ coat proteins and localize at _LOCATION_ export sites that track with the _LOCATION_ apparatus in tobacco leaf epidermal cells . _PROTEIN_ is also localized at additional structures that originate from the _LOCATION_ apparatus but that lack coatomer supporting the model that _PROTEIN_ also has a coatomer independent role for post _LOCATION_ protein transport in plants . when _LOCATION_ to _LOCATION_ protein transport is inhibited by mutations that hamper _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ activity without directly disrupting the _PROTEIN_ machinery for _LOCATION_ protein export _LOCATION_ markers are localized in the _LOCATION_ and the punctate distribution of and at the _LOCATION_ export sites is lost . these findings suggest that _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ protein distribution is _PROTEIN_ by the balanced action of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and that _PROTEIN_ coatomer is most likely indirectly required for forward trafficking out of the _LOCATION_ due to its role in recycling components that are essential for differentiation of the _LOCATION_ export domains formed by the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ system .
to determine the distribution of _PROTEIN_ in tobacco leaf epidermal cells a green _METHOD_ fusion _METHOD_ of an arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was used for confocal microscopy analysis . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was distributed on punctate structures of heterogeneous size . the larger _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ structures corresponded to _LOCATION_ bodies as shown by co _PROTEIN_ experiments with a yellow _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ fusion to the _LOCATION_ marker _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ . to establish the origin of the smaller _PROTEIN_ labelled structures we monitored the distribution of _PROTEIN_ with respect to the _LOCATION_ apparatus over time in cells co _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ . we observed that small _PROTEIN_ structures formed on a _LOCATION_ stack and eventually detached from it . our localization data support additional roles of _PROTEIN_ besides regulation of _PROTEIN_ assembly . to provide further evidence for this we investigated whether coatomer was distributed on the non _LOCATION_ structures labelled by _PROTEIN_ . co _PROTEIN_ experiments using either _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ with a _METHOD_ fusion to an arabidopsis _METHOD_ a component of the _PROTEIN_ coatomer demonstrated that coatomer co localized with the _LOCATION_ marker but not with the additional _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ structures . this suggests that _PROTEIN_ coatomer components only appear to play a role in intra _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ to _LOCATION_ transport although _PROTEIN_ may have additional roles besides _PROTEIN_ assembly at the _LOCATION_ apparatus . to provide evidence of a dynamic cycle of _PROTEIN_ on and off the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ in living plant cells and to correlate the residence time of _PROTEIN_ on _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ with the exchange of protein cargo between the _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ apparatus we used _METHOD_ recovery after photobleaching analysis on _METHOD_ fusions of _PROTEIN_ or _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ in tobacco leaves . frap allows measurement of the rate of movement of a _METHOD_ marker towards and from defined areas of a cell . a significant _METHOD_ recovery indicates that the bleached molecules are exchanging with _METHOD_ pools of the protein localized in other parts of the cell assuming that chimaeric protein levels in the bleached area had reached a steady state at the start of each experiment . by photobleaching _METHOD_ _METHOD_ we calculated that coatomer associates and dissociates from _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ with a half time of sec . photobleaching of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ on the _LOCATION_ bodies was followed by a rapid _METHOD_ recovery which was significantly faster than that of _METHOD_ . frap experiments on _LOCATION_ bodies labelled with _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ which is known to distribute all over the _LOCATION_ stack indicated a half time recovery of _METHOD_ of sec much slower than the half time values measured for coatomer and _PROTEIN_ . these data show that not only does a _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ protein move to and from the _LOCATION_ apparatus as described earlier and for other _LOCATION_ proteins such as _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ but also reveal that _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ components exchange continuously at the surface of the _LOCATION_ apparatus providing evidence for constant remodelling of the membranous and soluble components of this organelle . to analyze in vivo whether interference with the normal cycling of _PROTEIN_ on and off _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ would influence _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ protein distribution we examined the effects of active and inactive _METHOD_ of _PROTEIN_ on the distribution of a _METHOD_ fusion of _LOCATION_ which is exported from the _LOCATION_ by _PROTEIN_ carriers and cycles continuously between _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ at the same rate as other _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ markers . therefore we co _PROTEIN_ this marker with either wild type _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ sequences bearing point mutations that create dominant negative mutants of the _PROTEIN_ by enhancing its affinity for either gdp or _PROTEIN_ . to identify cells _PROTEIN_ untagged _PROTEIN_ or its mutant _METHOD_ we subcloned their coding sequences in a bi cistronic vector encoding a cyan _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ spliced to the tripeptide serine lysine leucine _METHOD_ for targeting to _LOCATION_ . we then co transformed tobacco leaf epidermal cells with these bi cistronic vectors and with a plasmid encoding _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ . to produce comparable results we used the same optical density of agrobacterium containing the different constructs for tobacco leaf transient transformation and we analyzed samples by confocal microscopy at the same time after transformation . in the presence of wild type _PROTEIN_ we observed a typical punctate distribution of the _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ in agreement with reports that over _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ does not affect the distribution of _LOCATION_ markers and has no effect on protein secretion . co _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ with _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ caused re absorbance of the _LOCATION_ marker into the _LOCATION_ in the majority of cells co _PROTEIN_ the mutant and _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ . however the _METHOD_ of the marker was mostly distributed in the _LOCATION_ in the majority of cells co _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ . the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ appeared enlarged in those cells where _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ were re absorbed into the _LOCATION_ in comparison to control cells . this is probably due to accumulation of a _LOCATION_ pool of _METHOD_ _LOCATION_ whose export is inhibited by the mutants . to determine whether _PROTEIN_ mutants could have a similar effect on other _LOCATION_ markers we co _PROTEIN_ wild type _PROTEIN_ and its mutants with _METHOD_ fusions of either a rat sialyl transferase transmembrane domain _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or an arabidopsis xylosyltransferase _LOCATION_ tail and transmembrane domain _METHOD_ . under these conditions we verified that the effect of _PROTEIN_ mutants on the distribution of these proteins is similar to that of _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ . these data show that disruption of the _PROTEIN_ machinery at the _LOCATION_ apparatus mediated by _PROTEIN_ mutants is followed by collapse of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ into the _LOCATION_ . as the _LOCATION_ markers used in these experiments cycle continuously in and out of the _LOCATION_ apparatus most likely from and to the _LOCATION_ the redistribution of the _LOCATION_ markers into the _LOCATION_ suggests an interruption of protein exchange between the _LOCATION_ and the _LOCATION_ apparatus . to confirm further that _PROTEIN_ has a stronger negative effect on protein export from the _LOCATION_ than does _PROTEIN_ we co transfected tobacco leaf protoplasts with the secretory marker amylase and a dilution series of untagged _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ mutants . _PROTEIN_ did not affect amylase secretion but the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants exhibited a negative effect on the secretion of amylase . _PROTEIN_ exhibited a stronger effect than _PROTEIN_ on secretion of the soluble marker . these data mirror our microscopy results showing that _PROTEIN_ affected the _LOCATION_ export of a _LOCATION_ marker more strongly than _PROTEIN_ under the same experimental conditions and suggest that the two mutants may block _LOCATION_ export by different means . to determine whether the _PROTEIN_ mutants perturbed the distribution of _LOCATION_ proteins at the _LOCATION_ apparatus with different _METHOD_ we first aimed to determine the subcellular localizations of their _METHOD_ protein fusions by confocal microscopy . the activity of these proteins was also tested by a biochemical assay . _METHOD_ fusions of the inactive and active mutants of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were _PROTEIN_ in tobacco leaf epidermal cells using the same agrobacterium optical density and confocal microscope imaging settings to compare the levels of _PROTEIN_ between cells . we hypothesized that _PROTEIN_ should be localized in the _LOCATION_ as although it should be able to bind to _LOCATION_ via its interaction with a guanine nucleotide exchange _PROTEIN_ its inability to exchange gdp for _PROTEIN_ would be followed by fast release from the _LOCATION_ into the _LOCATION_ causing its association with _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ to be undetectable . consistent with our hypothesis permanently inactive _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was localized in the _LOCATION_ at any level of _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ trapped mutant was instead distributed to punctate structures in most cells corresponding well with observations by citation . to determine the identity of the structures highlighted by _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ we co _PROTEIN_ the fusion with _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ . we found that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ mostly co localized with the _LOCATION_ marker but also highlighted additional structures which coincided with those marked by wild type _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . we also detected a _LOCATION_ distribution of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in those cells that were over _PROTEIN_ the mutant . in these cells _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ was distributed in the _LOCATION_ . these data suggest that the _PROTEIN_ mutants may affect _PROTEIN_ distribution via different _METHOD_ . in _PROTEIN_ the _LOCATION_ distribution of _PROTEIN_ indicates that this mutant is not able to initiate the assembly of _PROTEIN_ machinery at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . _LOCATION_ associated _PROTEIN_ may be capable of initiating the assembly of _PROTEIN_ machinery on the _LOCATION_ . to explore these hypotheses further we co _PROTEIN_ untagged _PROTEIN_ with either _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ . this caused a _LOCATION_ distribution of both markers in comparison with the controls . these results suggest that _PROTEIN_ gdp most likely titrates out any _PROTEIN_ gefs needed for the activation of wild type _PROTEIN_ at the _LOCATION_ apparatus and consequently impedes the association of coatomer to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . in the presence of _PROTEIN_ bound mutant coatomer was capable of cycling on and off _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . this result prompted us to test the extent to which protein exchange between _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ could be affected by this mutant . therefore we performed frap analysis on _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ labelled by _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ . as this marker cycles between the _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ apparatus a difference in the recovery of _METHOD_ of _LOCATION_ in the _LOCATION_ apparatus in comparison to a control would indicate that the _PROTEIN_ mutant may affect protein cycling between the _LOCATION_ and the _LOCATION_ apparatus . photobleaching of _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ in the presence of the mutant was followed by recovery indicating that _LOCATION_ to _LOCATION_ protein transport was occurring . however comparison with the recovery rate of the _METHOD_ of the same _LOCATION_ marker in control cells indicated that the mutant significantly reduced the recovery of _METHOD_ of _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ into the _LOCATION_ apparatus . therefore constitutive activation of _PROTEIN_ on _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ most likely retards protein cargo exchange at the _LOCATION_ interface . the slower recovery of _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ at the _LOCATION_ apparatus suggested that _PROTEIN_ activity of the _PROTEIN_ mutant was not entirely abolished . to test this we bleached the _METHOD_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ on _LOCATION_ stacks . upon photobleaching _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ the _METHOD_ recovered with a half time of sec which is threefold slower than the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ half time in accordance with results in mammalian cells and in vitro . taken together our results indicate that inactive _PROTEIN_ prevents _PROTEIN_ formation at the _LOCATION_ apparatus while the active _PROTEIN_ mutant allows _PROTEIN_ formation and _PROTEIN_ mediated protein transport with a reduced activity in comparison with wild type _PROTEIN_ . we next aimed to test whether impaired _PROTEIN_ activity affects the integrity of the _LOCATION_ export machinery . for this we used a _METHOD_ fusion of an arabidopsis a _PROTEIN_ coat component _METHOD_ to label the _LOCATION_ . to ensure that _METHOD_ retained its functionality we tested its ability to interact with another _PROTEIN_ coat component and form a heterodimeric complex in a glutathione agarose affinity chromatography assay based on the interaction of a recombinant _PROTEIN_ with plant _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . _METHOD_ was found to interact with _PROTEIN_ but not with _PROTEIN_ alone . therefore _METHOD_ is a functional marker capable of interacting with as shown in mammalian cells . at a subcellular level _METHOD_ was localized at punctate structures and in the _LOCATION_ . co _PROTEIN_ experiments using _METHOD_ with _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ indicated that these structures localized at the peri _LOCATION_ area with the exception of additional rare bright _METHOD_ structures of variable size that did not localize at the peri _LOCATION_ area _METHOD_ . we also verified that the _METHOD_ labelled _LOCATION_ tracked together with _LOCATION_ stacks . furthermore the _PROTEIN_ of a _LOCATION_ marker did not appear to be necessary for the movement of _METHOD_ punctate structures as these were motile in cells _PROTEIN_ the construct alone . similar results were achieved with a _METHOD_ fusion of another _PROTEIN_ component _METHOD_ although the percentage of structures that did not co localize was lower than that of . these data reveal that in tobacco leaf epidermal cells _PROTEIN_ markers can label _LOCATION_ without over _PROTEIN_ of _LOCATION_ marker proteins and support previous findings that _LOCATION_ are in close association with the _LOCATION_ stacks . to explore the influence of _PROTEIN_ machinery on the differentiation of _LOCATION_ we co _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ with _METHOD_ fusions of wild type and mutant _PROTEIN_ proteins . in the presence of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was distributed at the peri _LOCATION_ area but not at the additional smaller structures labelled by _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . however _METHOD_ was distributed into the _LOCATION_ in co _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . in the presence of the active _PROTEIN_ mutant the punctate appearance of the _LOCATION_ at the _LOCATION_ area labelled by _METHOD_ was _PROTEIN_ in most cells . in cells that were highly over _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was distributed in the _LOCATION_ . similar results were obtained with the other _PROTEIN_ marker _METHOD_ . these data indicate that collapse of _PROTEIN_ mediated protein transport perturbs differentiation of _LOCATION_ export sites and distribution of _LOCATION_ proteins at the _LOCATION_ apparatus . taken together our findings also suggest that _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ their integrity as long as _PROTEIN_ mediated protein transport takes place .
standard molecular techniques were used for subcloning . the _METHOD_ proteins used in this study were based on fusions with either _METHOD_ _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ . the spectral properties of _METHOD_ allow efficient spectral separation from _METHOD_ . as a _LOCATION_ marker we used the h/kdel receptor _LOCATION_ fused to _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and xylo _METHOD_ . for the xylo _METHOD_ construct the dna sequence encompassing the cytoplasmic tail and transmembrane region of an arabidopsis xylosyltransferase that have been shown to target the _LOCATION_ apparatus in nicotiana benthamiana as a _METHOD_ fusion was amplified by pcr and subcloned into upstream of a _METHOD_ sequence using xbai and sali sites of the binary vector . for coatomer labelling we generated a _METHOD_ fusion with the arabidopsis homologue of a component of the _PROTEIN_ coatomer . the coding sequence for was obtained from _PROTEIN_ and amplified by pcr with primers containing the xbai and sali sites for subcloning upstream of _METHOD_ in the binary vector . to generate _METHOD_ fusions of _PROTEIN_ proteins we used the dna of the _PROTEIN_ kindly provided by j. denecke and spliced it upstream of a _METHOD_ protein sequence in the binary vector with the xbai and sali sites . for labelling of _LOCATION_ export sites the arabidopsis homologues of and were obtained as _PROTEIN_ clones and fused to the n terminus of a _METHOD_ using the bamhi and saci sites of the binary vector . for agrobacterium tumefaciens transient _PROTEIN_ of untagged arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ and its gdp and _PROTEIN_ restricted mutants we used a modified binary vector bearing two pnos reading cassettes in direct orientation . in one cassette we subcloned the dna coding sequence of the proteins within the unique xbai and saci sites and in the other cassette we subcloned a _METHOD_ skl fusion to ensure visualization of _LOCATION_ . the primer sequences used for the subcloning indicated above are available upon request . for amylase experiments plasmids bearing the sequences encoding the wild type _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants described in citation were used . four week old nicotiana tabacum greenhouse plants grown at were used for agrobacterium tumefaciens mediated transient _PROTEIN_ . the bacterial optical density used for plant transformation was for tagged and untagged versions of _PROTEIN_ and its mutants and for _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ and xylo constructs . for transient _PROTEIN_ in protoplasts nicotiana tabacum plants were grown in murashige and skoog medium and sucrose in a controlled room at with a h h dark regime at a light irradiance of me . tobacco leaf protoplast preparation and subsequent dna transfection via electroporation were performed as described by citation and the plasmid concentrations used are given in figure . for these experiments we used untagged _PROTEIN_ proteins subcloned in _PROTEIN_ vectors described by citation and tagged _PROTEIN_ proteins that were subcloned into the binary vector . after incubation for h in the dark the protoplast suspension was spun for min at g in a swing out centrifuge which results in the floating of the cells . using an extra fine pasteur pipette ml of clear supernatant from below the floating cell layer was removed . the remainder of the suspension was brought to ml with mm nacl and mixed gently by inverting the tube twice . after a second spin of min at g the supernatant was removed with a peristaltic pump and the cell pellet was placed on ice . the cells were extracted in a final volume of . equal volumes of cell extract and culture medium were analysed by protein gel blotting or by enzymatic analysis . protoplasts were extracted in amylase extraction buffer via sonication for sec . the extracts were centrifuged for min at g at and the supernatant was recovered . the culture medium was also spun for min at g at to remove residual cell debris . the amylase assays and calculation of the secretion index were performed as described previously . the secretion index represents the ratio between the _LOCATION_ and intracellular activity . transformed leaves were analysed h after infection of the lower epidermis . imaging was performed using an upright zeiss laser scanning confocal microscope _PROTEIN_ meta and a water immersion objective . for imaging _PROTEIN_ of either _METHOD_ constructs or _METHOD_ constructs or both we used imaging setting as described by citation with a pinhole diameter . time lapse scanning was acquired with imaging system software of the microscope . comparison of different levels of _PROTEIN_ between cells _PROTEIN_ tagged _PROTEIN_ mutants was carried out by visualizing cells with the same imaging settings of the confocal microscope as described by citation . for each image we used the palette function of the microscope software which measures the _METHOD_ intensity value for each image pixel . differences in the number of saturated pixels between cells were an indication of higher or lower concentrations of a _METHOD_ fusion . subsequently only for presentation purposes in this paper the images may have been acquired with different settings . spot frap experiments for fluorochrome photobleaching and half time computation were performed as described by citation . significance was determined using a student two tailed t test for two samples assuming equal variance . for frap experiments a steady state protein distribution at the _LOCATION_ bodies was assumed . such an assumption is reasonable as frap experiments have not produced appreciable differences when performed at either or days after transformation when the levels of _PROTEIN_ are highest . production of _PROTEIN_ subcloned in pgex vector was induced in esherichia coli lysogens . positive clones were selected for low scale protein production . a single colony was inoculated initially into ml of luria bertani containing ampicillin further expanded into a ml shaker culture in ml flasks . the cells were incubated with shaking at until an of approximately was reached . protein production was induced by the addition of mm iptg and further incubation of the culture for h at . cells were then pelleted and lysed according to the instructions provided by the manufacturer of the glutathione resin columns for binding of _PROTEIN_ tagged proteins . protein binding removal of endogenous proteins and elution of _PROTEIN_ tagged proteins were performed according to the manufacturer 's instructions . a sample of leaves transformed with _METHOD_ was subjected to protein extraction in ml of ne buffer with protease inhibitor cocktail for plant cell extracts in liquid . the resulting suspension was then centrifuged at g for min . an aliquot of the supernatant was added to of a glutathione agarose beads suspension previously mixed with bacterial lysates containing _PROTEIN_ and washed from unbound proteins . the mix was kept for h at with gentle rotation . the beads were centrifuged at g for min and then washed three times with ns buffer . bound proteins were eluted from the beads with an appropriate volume of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ sample buffer _PROTEIN_ and run on a _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ gel . western blot analysis of proteins was conducted on protoplast extracts after sonication of protoplasts in amylase extraction buffer and on leaf extracts in ne buffer . protein samples were resuspended in amylase extraction buffer and were loaded in equal volumes after twofold dilution with _PROTEIN_ loading buffer prior to boiling . proteins in _PROTEIN_ polyacrylamide gels were transferred onto a nitrocellulose _LOCATION_ and then blocked with _PROTEIN_ tween and milk powder for h. the filter was then incubated in blocking buffer with primary antibody at a dilution of for the anti _METHOD_ serum and for the anti igg antibody . all the antisera were from rabbits and further steps were performed as described by citation .
