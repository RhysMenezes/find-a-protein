calnexin _PROTEIN_ is a highly conserved _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ chaperone protein . both calnexin and the homologous _LOCATION_ lumenal protein calreticulin bind calcium ions and participate in protein folding . there are two calnexins in arabidopsis thaliana _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . gus _PROTEIN_ demonstrated that these are _PROTEIN_ in most arabidopsis tissues throughout development . calnexin transfer dna mutant lines exhibited increased transcript abundances of a number of other _LOCATION_ chaperones including calreticulins suggesting a degree of redundancy . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ localised to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ including that within plasmodesmata the intercellular channels connecting plant cells . this is comparable with the previous localisations of calreticulin in the _LOCATION_ lumen and at plasmodesmata . however from green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ diffusion studies in single and double t dna insertion mutant lines as well as overexpression lines we found no evidence that _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ play a role in intercellular transport through plasmodesmata . in addition calnexin t dna mutant lines showed no change in transcript abundance of a number of plasmodesmata related proteins . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ do not appear to have a specific localisation or function at the association of calnexin with the _LOCATION_ is simply _PROTEIN_ as the _LOCATION_ passes through plasmodesmata .
in order to determine where _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are _PROTEIN_ during development arabidopsis plants were engineered to _PROTEIN_ gus under the control of the _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ promoters . five independent lines were examined for each promoter and representative images are presented in fig . . the _PROTEIN_ patterns of both gus and gus lines were similar throughout development . gus was _PROTEIN_ in imbibed and germinating seeds and was in the cotyledons and roots of young seedlings . in older plate grown seedlings and mature plants gus _PROTEIN_ was in all tissues including roots apical _METHOD_ cotyledons rosette leaves and vascular tissue . since the rosette leaves of these plate grown plants were stunted fully expanded leaves of week old soil grown plants were also examined . the leaves were cut into segments to aid stain penetration . gus _PROTEIN_ was observed in these leaves particularly in the _PROTEIN_ veins but not the midrib . in floral tissues gus _PROTEIN_ was in sepals stigmas the upper parts of stamens and styles and in pollen grains . in contrast gus _PROTEIN_ was in stigmas and the upper parts of styles and was not in pollen . these results indicate that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are _PROTEIN_ in most plant tissues throughout development although some differences do exist in reproductive tissues . to investigate the role of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis two t dna insertion mutants were examined _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and these were crossed to produce a _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant . there were no significant differences between the morphologies of the single or double mutants and wild type plants . each line grew at a similar rate . the number of t dna insertions was determined for the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants . while both insertions in the line were in exons of the _PROTEIN_ gene there were two insertions in the line one in an exon of the _PROTEIN_ gene and another in the exon of the adjacent tudor sn protein gene _PROTEIN_ . the effects of this secondary insertion in _PROTEIN_ did not significantly affect our characterisations of _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in seedlings of the calnexin t dna insertion mutants was examined using qrt pcr . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ overexpression lines where the promoter drove calnexin cdna _PROTEIN_ were also included . _PROTEIN_ transcript was not detected in the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutants and _PROTEIN_ transcript was not detected in the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutants . _PROTEIN_ transcript was significantly elevated in _PROTEIN_ mutants . both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ transcripts were significantly elevated in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ overexpression lines respectively . _PROTEIN_ transcript was absent from the _PROTEIN_ mutant and the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant as well as from a _PROTEIN_ mutant which was included as a control . in comparison transcripts of a second arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ gene _PROTEIN_ did not differ significantly from wild type levels . western blots showed that total _PROTEIN_ protein levels were reduced in seedlings of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants and were elevated in the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ overexpression lines . the calnexin antibody could not distinguish between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and the calnexin band represents their levels combined . the antibody also recognised calreticulin and the calreticulin band represents the combined levels of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . generally the pattern of calnexin protein levels correlated with the pattern of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ transcripts levels . crt protein levels in the mutant plants and overexpression lines were similar to those of wild type . the transcript abundances of genes associated with the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ were examined in calnexin t dna insertion mutants . these included the three calreticulin genes _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ the genes of _LOCATION_ localised chaperones binding protein _PROTEIN_ shepherd _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ resident j protein _LOCATION_ stromal derived _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ a constituent of an _LOCATION_ translocation channel _PROTEIN_ and a putative _LOCATION_ protein with a saposin b domain _PROTEIN_ _GENE_ . the levels of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ transcript in the calnexin mutants were elevated compared with wild type while _PROTEIN_ transcript abundance was higher only in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . in general the transcript abundances of the other _LOCATION_ genes _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were also elevated in the mutants . this was particularly evident in the _PROTEIN_ mutant where transcripts of eight of the nine _LOCATION_ related genes increased significantly . thus in the absence of _PROTEIN_ and/or _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis there was up regulation of the transcripts of other _LOCATION_ related proteins . to investigate their cellular localisation _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were tagged with _METHOD_ at their c terminus and _PROTEIN_ using the camv promoter in transgenic arabidopsis plants . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ localised to a network of tubules in the cortical cytoplasm of arabidopsis leaf epidermal cells resembling cortical _LOCATION_ . to confirm this _LOCATION_ localisation both fusion proteins were transiently co _PROTEIN_ with mcherry targeted to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ in n. benthamiana leaf epidermal cells . there was strong co localisation between _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _LOCATION_ mcherry at the _LOCATION_ . when the native gene sequences of _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ were tagged at the c terminus with _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ under the control of the native _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ promoters _METHOD_ _METHOD_ in arabidopsis or n. benthamiana they also localised to the _LOCATION_ . electron microscopy showed that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ localised to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ in transgenic arabidopsis leaf cells . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ formed _METHOD_ puncta along the anticlinal walls of arabidopsis leaf epidermal cells which often co located with sites of aniline blue induced _METHOD_ of callose which is located at plasmodesmata . this suggests that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are associated with _LOCATION_ in the cortical cytoplasm adjacent to plasmodesmata and/or _LOCATION_ within the plasmodesmata . similar patterns were seen for _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ when _PROTEIN_ from their native promoters and also _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ . since confocal imaging used here did not have sufficient resolution to image individual plasmodesmata or distinguish between _METHOD_ at plasmodesmata and the nearby cortical _LOCATION_ electron microscopy and immunogold labelling were used to determine if _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ did indeed localise to plasmodesmata . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were located at plasmodesmata in transgenic arabidopsis root tips with the density of immunogold particles at plasmodesmata significantly higher than in the intervening cell walls . in contrast _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ was not at plasmodesmata . since _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ appear to remain associated with _LOCATION_ as it traverses the cell wall through plasmodesmata we asked if they played a role in plasmodesmatal function . to assess whether the permeability of plasmodesmata was affected in the calnexin mutants individual arabidopsis leaf epidermal cells were transformed transiently to _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in the cytoplasm and the number of cell layers into which the _METHOD_ diffused was counted . there was no statistically significant difference in _METHOD_ diffusion between wild type the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutants and _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ overexpression lines . _METHOD_ diffusion was also unaffected in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . another indicator of plasmodesmatal physiology the amount of callose accumulated at neck regions can be estimated by measuring the _METHOD_ intensity of punctate aniline blue _METHOD_ along cell boundaries . all the lines that varied in their calnexin _PROTEIN_ exhibited statistically significantly lower aniline blue _METHOD_ intensity compared with wild type suggesting that there was less callose at their plasmodesmata . in the _PROTEIN_ mutant the intensity of aniline blue was unaffected suggesting that the secondary t dna insertion in the _PROTEIN_ mutant did not significantly impact callose levels . the transcript abundances of genes associated with plasmodesmata namely plasmodesmata callose binding protein _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ putative plasmodesmata associated protein and reversibly glycosylated polypeptide _PROTEIN_ were examined in calnexin t dna insertion mutants . there were no statistical significant increases or _PROTEIN_ in the transcript levels of the plasmodesmata related genes in the mutant plants .
sterilised arabidopsis seeds were germinated in soil or on murashige and skoog salts _METHOD_ plates _METHOD_ sucrose bacto agar ph phytotechnology laboratories shawnee mission _PROTEIN_ usa and sterilised nicotiana benthamiana seeds on agar plates containing hoagland s media . plants were grown at or for h . light intensity was lux . after weeks seedlings were transferred to a soil mix and grown in the same conditions . all cloning used pcr amplification of dna with using primers containing attb sites followed by gateway recombination into an entry vector and then into destination vectors . complementary dna for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were pcr amplified with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or without stop codons _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . the cdna without stop codons was recombined into _METHOD_ ghent university belgium http //gateway.psb.ugent.be to generate the binary vectors green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ respectively to create c terminal _METHOD_ fusion constructs . the coding regions of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ with stop codon were recombined into and respectively to generate _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ overexpression vectors . each of these constructs included the promoter to drive _PROTEIN_ of the transgene . fusion of the _PROTEIN_ native promoters and coding regions to _METHOD_ was achieved by pcr amplification of genomic sequences of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ from to bases upstream of the start codon respectively to before the stop codon _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and recombination of pcr products into a modified with the promoter removed to generate the binary vectors _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ . the promoter regions of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were

spermidine then resuspended in ethanol and loaded onto macrocarriers . the abaxial side of mature rosette leaves from soil grown arabidopsis plants approximately four weeks old were bombarded at inhg vacuum in a _PROTEIN_ particle delivery system with psi rupture disks . the identities of bombarded leaves were concealed and the leaves were randomly selected for visualisation h after bombardment using an axiophot _METHOD_ microscope equipped with a _METHOD_ emission filter set and objective lens . a series of images of individual transformed cells was captured at sequential focal planes with a ccd camera using dps bsw software . the images were combined into stacks using imagej then were transformed into a image using the stack focuser plug in . the number of cell layers into which _METHOD_ had diffused from a transformed cell was counted from the images . there were at least three biological replicates . data was analysed using ibm spss statistics . the data was not normal so the nonparametric tests of kruskal wallis and mann whitney u were used to analyse it . mature soil grown arabidopsis rosette leaves were cut into segments approximately and these were immersed in aniline blue fluorochrome in m phosphate buffer . specimens from different plant lines taken from across leaves were randomly selected for imaging with their identities concealed at min post staining using the axiophot microscope with an ultraviolet filter and a acroplan water dipping objective . cells approximately five rows inside the cut edges were selected for imaging because the stain penetrated into their walls and callose deposits were easily seen . wounded or dead cells were avoided . images were captured with the camera . in imagej _METHOD_ intensity profiles were created from a manually selected path along cell walls . the intensity profile was analysed and the brighter peaks were flagged as corresponding to stained pit fields from which the background wall _METHOD_ intensity was subtracted . these analyses were conducted in at least three biological replicates . data was log transformed to remove heterogeneity of variance and analysed using analysis of variance

multi channel scans were collected . all reagents were sourced from proscitech or sigma aldrich unless otherwise stated . arabidopsis roots _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ targeted to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ seed obtained from the arabidopsis biological resource centre columbus oh usa were fixed in paraformaldehyde and glutaraldehyde in pme _PROTEIN_ for h. roots were washed in pme and then dehydrated in a graded ethanol series over h. lr white resin with benzoyl peroxide catalyst was infiltrated into the roots over h at and resin followed by resin . alternatively cotyledons and leaves of day old arabidopsis seedlings _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were rapidly frozen in a leica em _PROTEIN_ high pressure freezer and freeze substituted in uranyl acetate and glutaraldehyde in acetone for days in a leica automatic freeze substitution processor set to . the samples were warmed to then infiltrated with a graded series of catalysed lr white resin over days . all samples were infiltrated in lr white supplemented with accelerator over h then were embedded and polymerised at under a w ultraviolet lamp for days . ultrathin sections were transferred to nickel grids coated with support film . to immunolabel the grids were incubated with mg/ml bsa tween and goat serum in phosphate buffered saline _PROTEIN_ for min . grids

conjugated to alexa fluor diluted in _PROTEIN_ with mg/ml bsa . gold enhancement was performed with a goldenhance kit according to the manufacturer s instructions with the enhancement solution applied for min . sections were post stained with aqueous uranyl acetate and reynold s lead citrate each for min . a jem equipped with a gatan _LOCATION_ camera was used to image the sections . all gold particles were counted at plasmodesmata and in the intervening wall in micrographs for _PROTEIN_ micrographs for _PROTEIN_ and micrographs for _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ samples . all visible plasmodesmatal regions and intervening walls were traced digitally and their total surface areas were determined using imagej . the densities of gold per region of cell wall or plasmodesmata were calculated and data was analysed using student s t test . gus activity in arabidopsis tissues was visualised using bromo chloro indolyl _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . plant tissue was fixed in ice cold acetone for min at then incubated in staining buffer _PROTEIN_ mm _PROTEIN_ triton x ph for min at then with staining buffer plus mg/ml x _PROTEIN_ . the stain was infiltrated into tissues under vacuum for at least min on

microscope or scanned using a flatbed scanner . rna was extracted from tissues using the rneasy plant kit with additional on column dnase treatment . to synthesise cdna total rna was reverse transcribed in reactions using the iscript cdna synthesis kit with oligo dt and random hexamer primers according to the manufacturer s instructions . each qrt pcr reaction contained cdna of each primer and sybr green master mix . reactions were run in a lightcycler instrument with amplification cycles of for s for s and for s. melting curves were determined by denaturation at for s followed by ramping from to at during with _METHOD_ acquisition every . primer pairs were designed using probefinder version and are listed in table . transcript abundance was normalised to the reference gene _PROTEIN_ . two to three biological replicate samples were analysed in duplicate pcrs . the relative quantities of the candidate genes and reference genes were calculated by the e method . the pcr efficiency was determined using linregpcr software and used to calculate corrected mean quantities of each gene in each sample relative to the reference gene along with the standard deviations of the technical replicates . t tests were used to determine if there were statistically significant differences in transcript levels between calnexin mutants and wild type plants . we hypothesised that in the absence of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ the corresponding calnexin levels would _PROTEIN_ and when _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ were overexpressed the corresponding calnexin levels would _PROTEIN_ . we also hypothesised that in the absence of _PROTEIN_ and/or _PROTEIN_ mutant plants would increase the levels of other _LOCATION_ related proteins . for these reasons one tailed t tests were used for this data . in comparison we hypothesised that the levels of plasmodesmata related proteins could either increase or _PROTEIN_ in the mutant plants so two tailed t tests were used for this data . whole day old plate grown arabidopsis seedlings were ground to a powder while frozen and total protein was extracted in laemmli extraction buffer at for min . total protein was quantified and then separated
