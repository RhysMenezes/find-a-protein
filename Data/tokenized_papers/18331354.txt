exposure of arabidopsis thaliana plants to high levels of light revealed specific phosphorylation of a kda protein in photosynthetic _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . the protein was identified by _METHOD_ as _LOCATION_ receptor _PROTEIN_ previously reported to be located in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . by confocal laser scanning microscopy and subcellular fractionation it was demonstrated that _PROTEIN_ localizes to the chloroplasts and is enriched in stroma _LOCATION_ . the phosphorylation level of _PROTEIN_ responded strongly to light intensity . the _LOCATION_ protein kinase _PROTEIN_ is required for _PROTEIN_ phosphorylation . the phosphorylation site was mapped to the located in a motif for interaction with proteins and proteins with domains which suggests the involvement of _PROTEIN_ in stress responses and signaling pathways . the knockout arabidopsis lines revealed a significant role for _PROTEIN_ in plant growth and development .
in order to investigate the molecular _METHOD_ involved in acclimation of plant photosynthetic machinery to high light intensities we isolated _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ from the leaves of arabidopsis and analyzed the changes in protein phosphorylation by immunoblotting with antibody . this analysis revealed the phosphorylation of a novel polypeptide with a molecular _METHOD_ of about kda whose level of phosphorylation strongly increased with rising irradiance . to identify this kda phosphoprotein _LOCATION_ isolated from leaves exposed to treatment were subjected to trypsin shaving . the domains of _LOCATION_ proteins were released and separated from the _LOCATION_ by centrifugation . the resulting complex mixture of hydrophilic peptides was subjected to immobilized metal affinity chromatography _PROTEIN_ for phosphopeptide enrichment . the enriched phosphopeptides were analyzed by liquid chromatography _METHOD_ . besides several known phosphopeptides of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ the analysis of data allowed the identification of a novel previously uncharacterized phosphopeptide . the product ion spectrum of the corresponding doubly charged molecular ion with m/z is presented in fig . . the series of and revealed the peptide sequence sgtkflpssd with lowercase t indicating phoshorylated thr . a search in the arabidopsis protein sequence database revealed that the amino acid sequence belongs to the of the _PROTEIN_ protein _GENE_ with deduced molecular _METHOD_ kda previously described as an _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ . in a parallel approach the gel region corresponding to the kda phosphoprotein band in the gel was cut out and subjected to digestion for protein identification by _METHOD_ . _PROTEIN_ together with other proteins was identified from this gel band . _PROTEIN_ antibody was then used to determine whether the increased occurrence of phosphorylated _PROTEIN_ under conditions was related to an increase in the amount of _PROTEIN_ per se . as shown in fig . the total amount of _PROTEIN_ protein was not drastically changed by increasing irradiance but the phosphorylated form of _PROTEIN_ clearly accumulated under conditions as compared to darkness . localization of the _PROTEIN_ phosphoprotein to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ as discussed above is in good agreement with proteomics studies but strongly contrasts with a previous report of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ localization of _PROTEIN_ using heterologous _PROTEIN_ in onion epidermis cells which unfortunately lack chloroplasts . to address this apparent discrepancy the subcellular localization of the endogenous _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis was investigated by exploiting purified _LOCATION_ fractions and immunoblotting with purified _PROTEIN_ antibody . _PROTEIN_ was not found in purified _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ whereas it was present in intact chloroplasts and in the _LOCATION_ fraction but not in the stroma fraction . the purity of the _LOCATION_ fractions was demonstrated by using _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ ferroxidase and _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ antibodies as specific markers . to further dissect the distribution of _PROTEIN_ in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ the _LOCATION_ isolated from leaves exposed to high light were fractionated by digitonin . immunoblot analysis of _LOCATION_ fractions revealed the presence of _PROTEIN_ both in grana and in stroma _LOCATION_ and its clear enrichment in the _LOCATION_ . to further investigate the contradiction between our data and published reports showing the targeting of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ we fused the yellow _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ recombinantly to the of _PROTEIN_ and transiently _PROTEIN_ this construct in nicotiana benthamiana leaves . observations by confocal laser scanning microscopy clearly demonstrated that the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein localized in chloroplasts . in stark contrast the _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ control accumulated _METHOD_ _METHOD_ signal in the cell periphery and _LOCATION_ . these data clearly demonstrate that _PROTEIN_ predominantly resides in chloroplasts . coexpression of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ a protein used as a marker showed perfect overlap of the _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ signals and no signal was detected in the cell periphery . coexpression of cas _METHOD_ and the _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ further illustrated the exclusive localization of cas _METHOD_ in chloroplasts . to address the question of whether one of the two protein kinases _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ is required for the phosphorylation of _PROTEIN_ we isolated _LOCATION_ from the leaves of plants and two mutant lines lacking _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . immunoblot analysis of isolated _LOCATION_ with antibody revealed the absence of the kda _PROTEIN_ phosphorylation in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . analysis of the same fractions with _PROTEIN_ antibody revealed similar levels of _PROTEIN_ in all samples . the migration of _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ of _LOCATION_ proteins isolated from the _PROTEIN_ mutant was slightly faster than those of the and the _PROTEIN_ mutant which is typically observed when protein phosphorylation is altered . these data suggest that _PROTEIN_ is almost fully phosphorylated under conditions as the upper band corresponding to the phosphorylated form dominated under conditions in the and the _PROTEIN_ mutant . the involvement of _PROTEIN_ in the phosphorylation of _PROTEIN_ was further investigated by isolation of phosphopeptides from the and the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ and analyzing them by _METHOD_ . the mapping of phosphopeptides isolated from _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ in comparison to the and _PROTEIN_ showed the specific absence of the _PROTEIN_ phosphopeptide sgtkflpssd with m/z from the _LOCATION_ of only the _PROTEIN_ mutant . these results revealed that _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ is not phosphorylated at and suggest either that _PROTEIN_ is a direct target of the _PROTEIN_ protein kinase or _PROTEIN_ is a crucial component of the protein phosphorylation cascade involved in _PROTEIN_ phosphorylation . the mutant arabidopsis lines with insertion in the intron region of the _PROTEIN_ gene were obtained from and salk collections . knockout plants were identified by immunoblot analysis of isolated _LOCATION_ with _PROTEIN_ antibody and the antibody was used as a control for equal protein loading . the specific absence of the kda phosphoprotein band in _LOCATION_ isolated from knockout plants provides definite evidence that this band represents _PROTEIN_ . to verify the lack of _PROTEIN_ transcripts in the mutant plants analysis of mrna from the mutant and plants was performed . the _PROTEIN_ knockout plants showed retarded growth even under normal unstressed conditions indicating its important role in plant growth . to obtain further insights into the _METHOD_ responsible for the observed phenotype we analyzed the photochemical efficiency of psii by _METHOD_ measurements and the susceptibility of the _PROTEIN_ mutant to photoinhibition of psii . however no difference in the _PROTEIN_ of the variable _METHOD_ _METHOD_ ratio during high light illumination or during subsequent recovery at low light was observed between the and the _PROTEIN_ mutant at any time point . the whole chain electron transfer activities were also unaffected in the _PROTEIN_ mutant as compared to the . as _PROTEIN_ is an intrinsic _LOCATION_ protein we then tested whether the absence of _PROTEIN_ exerts any effects on the composition of the _LOCATION_ protein complexes . to this end an immunoblot analysis was performed on the contents of representative proteins in different _LOCATION_ protein complexes including the psi and psii core complexes _PROTEIN_ synthase and the lumenal complex . this analysis revealed no significant changes in psii psi and _PROTEIN_ synthase in the _PROTEIN_ mutant as compared to the . the tools targetp and chlorop strongly predict the _PROTEIN_ protein to be targeted to chloroplasts with the transit peptide corresponding to residues which gives a molecular _METHOD_ of kda for the mature protein . this calculated _METHOD_ is in accordance with the _METHOD_ identification of _PROTEIN_ in a gel region around kda together with _PROTEIN_ fnr and several other known proteins . the contains two motifs a noncatalytic rhodanese homology domain with the putative active residue substituted by asp and a motif that is involved in interaction with proteins and proteins with the _PROTEIN_ domain . these domains are found in a variety of signaling proteins and can bind directly to the phosphothreonine residue . the identified phosphorylation site of _PROTEIN_ lies within this motif . _PROTEIN_ appears to be a protein . it has homologs in oryza sativa and medicago truncatula as well as in the green algae chlamydomonas reinhardtii and ostreococcus tauri . no proteins with significant sequence similarity to _PROTEIN_ were found in cyanobacteria . according to hydropathy analysis _PROTEIN_ in higher plants has one transmembrane helix whereas the green algae proteins do not contain any transmembrane region . alignment of protein sequences with clustalw showed that phosphorylated is conserved in homologous proteins of green algae .
