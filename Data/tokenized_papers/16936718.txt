_PROTEIN_ cellular distribution of the phytohormone auxin and its carriers is essential for normal plant growth and development . _PROTEIN_ auxin transport is _PROTEIN_ by a network of auxin influx and efflux _PROTEIN_ carriers . both auxin transport and _PROTEIN_ protein cycling between the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and endosomes require the activity of the endosomal _PROTEIN_ however intracellular routes taken by these carriers remain largely unknown . here we show that arabidopsis thaliana sorting nexin _PROTEIN_ is involved in the auxin pathway and that _PROTEIN_ but not _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ is transported through _PROTEIN_ containing endosomes . we demonstrate that the _PROTEIN_ null mutant exhibits multiple auxin related defects and that loss of function of _PROTEIN_ severely enhances the phenotype of a weak gnom mutant . in root cells we further show that _PROTEIN_ localizes to an endosomal compartment distinct from _PROTEIN_ containing endosomes and that _PROTEIN_ accumulates in this compartment after treatment with the phosphatidylinositol oh kinase inhibitor wortmannin or after a gravity stimulus . our data reveal the existence of a novel endosomal compartment involved in _PROTEIN_ endocytic sorting and plant development .
we previously demonstrated that the product of brassica oleracea _PROTEIN_ the plant orthologue of human _PROTEIN_ interacts with different plant receptor kinases . snx proteins are cytoplasmic and _LOCATION_ associated proteins and are conserved among eukaryotes . the mammalian _PROTEIN_ and are implicated in endocytic sorting and have an essential function in embryonic development . in the genome of a. thaliana we found only three snx genes whereas the snx family in mammals contains about thirty members . to investigate the function of _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis thaliana we studied two allelic t dna insertion lines which are null mutants . these _PROTEIN_ mutants showed pleiotropic defects . we chose to focus on the well documented root tip cell biology system for study of _PROTEIN_ function . compared with wild type _PROTEIN_ mutants had shorter primary roots produced fewer secondary roots and exhibited an altered root gravitropic response . genomic dna fragments spanning the _PROTEIN_ gene fused to complementary dnas encoding green _METHOD_ or monomeric red _METHOD_ _METHOD_ protein were able to complement _PROTEIN_ indicating that _PROTEIN_ is the only gene impaired in the mutant lines . the features of the _PROTEIN_ phenotype resembled those of the gnomb/e mutant a very weak allele of the _PROTEIN_ gene . _PROTEIN_ encodes a gdp/gtp exchange _PROTEIN_ for small g proteins and is required for the proper _PROTEIN_ localization of _PROTEIN_ . notably like weak gnom alleles auxin maxima were disturbed in the roots of _PROTEIN_ mutants . moreover _PROTEIN_ gnomb/e double mutant plants exhibited a more severe phenotype than either of the single mutants . the marked phenotype of double mutant plants is not reminiscent of that caused by stronger gnom alleles for example . this indicates that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are involved in distinct pathways but nonetheless have partially overlapping functions in plant growth and development . to gain insight into the intracellular localization of _PROTEIN_ we used the complemented _PROTEIN_ transgenic lines _PROTEIN_ functional _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ proteins . in both lines we observed _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ proteins in round shaped intracellular compartments . we crossed the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ line with marker lines that constitutively _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ tagged proteins targeted to different intracellular compartments . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ did not co localize with two _LOCATION_ markers _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or with _METHOD_ which labels trans _LOCATION_ networks in plant cells . then we crossed the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ line with two lines _PROTEIN_ either the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ endosomal markers . we observed that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ co localized with both _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ tagged proteins in arabidopsis roots . these results indicate that _PROTEIN_ is located in an endosomal compartment . to verify this prediction we used the _METHOD_ dye as an endocytic tracer . in roots of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ plants _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ containing compartments were labelled after only min of internalization . next we treated roots with brefeldin a which inhibits transport from endosomes to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and causes endosomes to aggregate into bfa compartments . after min of bfa treatment _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ labelling accumulated with endocytosed in bfa compartments . altogether our results indicate that _PROTEIN_ labelled compartments are endosomes . as _PROTEIN_ is an endosomal bfa target in arabidopsis root cells we presumed that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are located in the same endosomes . to verify this we crossed a _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ line with the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ line . no co localization between the two _METHOD_ markers was detected although both were found in bfa sensitive compartments . inhibitors of phosphatidylinositol oh kinase such as wortmannin affect snx localization in mammalian cells . in root cells wortmannin treatment led to the appearance of one or two enlarged vacuolated _PROTEIN_ containing compartments per cell but did not alter the morphology of _PROTEIN_ containing endosomes . we conclude that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ containing endosomes are physically distinct although both are bfa sensitive only _PROTEIN_ containing endosomes exhibit sensitivity to wortmannin . although _PROTEIN_ regulates trafficking of the basally localized _PROTEIN_ recycling of _PROTEIN_ is partially independent of _PROTEIN_ . this implies that additional endocytic routes are involved in recycling of _PROTEIN_ and we proposed that _PROTEIN_ endosomes might be one of those . to test this assumption we treated seedlings _PROTEIN_ functional _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ with wortmannin . the wortmannin treatment was concomitant with an incubation of the same roots in the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide to ensure that _METHOD_ labelling reveals only previously synthesized proteins . whereas no difference was observed in the localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ after wortmannin treatment _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ some _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was relocalized to wortmannin induced compartments . moreover _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ that remained at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ seemed appropriately _PROTEIN_ apically in epidermal cells and basally in cortical cells . in addition the epidermal cells compared with cortical cells were particularly sensitive to wortmannin indicating that _PROTEIN_ trafficking might be differentially regulated in these two distinct cell files . the wortmannin induced compartments were shown to co localize with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in hybrid transgenic plants co _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . stimulation by gravity of root apices has recently been shown to result in internalization of _PROTEIN_ proteins at the upper side of the root whereas endocytosis is inhibited at the lower side . to explore whether _PROTEIN_ internalization during gravistimulation involves _PROTEIN_ endosomes we submitted seedlings of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ hybrid plant to a gravity stimulus . endocytosed _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ co localized with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ compartments indicating that _PROTEIN_ transits through these endosomes . _PROTEIN_ is another auxin carrier involved in root gravitropism that might be routed via _PROTEIN_ endosomes . to test this possibility we treated roots of an _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ line separately with bfa and wortmannin . under our experimental conditions neither drug affected _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ localization . localization of _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ fusion auxin carriers has been shown to correlate with that of the native proteins . it is reasonable to consider that the behaviour of _METHOD_ proteins in our experiments reflects the genuine dynamics of auxin carriers although we can not exclude that auxin carriers fused to _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ might have altered stability . altogether our results indicate that _PROTEIN_ but not _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ trafficks through wortmannin sensitive _PROTEIN_ containing endosomes . next we investigated the effects of long term wortmannin treatment on arabidopsis seedlings to see whether alteration of the _PROTEIN_ endosomal compartment may have significant consequences for plant development auxin distribution or _PROTEIN_ localization . phenotypic features reminiscent of those provoked by auxin transport inhibitors such as defects in root and hypocotyl gravitropism and elongation were induced by wortmannin in a concentration dependent manner . these modifications were accompanied by a clear alteration of auxin distribution exemplified by the signals obtained using the auxin maxima reporter _METHOD_ in the presence or absence of a gravity stimulus . the increased _METHOD_ signal at the root tip showing extension into _PROTEIN_ root cap and epidermis cells was very similar to the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ observed in plants with the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ knockout allele . this indicated that wortmannin treatment might affect _PROTEIN_ abundance and subcellular location . consistent with this prediction abundance and localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were markedly perturbed in cortical and epidermal cells of wortmannin treated seedlings . only a faint _METHOD_ signal was observed in root tips of wortmannin treated seedlings compared with the control . although _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was still _PROTEIN_ at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ accumulated in wortmannin induced compartments and also labelled the tonoplast . it is probable that endocytosed _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was targeted for degradation as demonstrated by the weak intensity of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signal . in contrast localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ after wortmannin treatment was not markedly different from control seedlings except that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ slightly expanded into some cortical cells . this is reminiscent of the ectopic _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ domains reported to occur in _PROTEIN_ . the low levels of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ detected in cortical and epidermal cells under wortmannin treatment could considerably reduce the uptake of auxin from columella cells . this would account for the observed enrichment of auxin in the root tip and the agravitropic phenotype of wortmannin treated seedlings . taken together our data show that _PROTEIN_ has a function in root growth and gravitropic response . although our results are consistent with altered auxin accumulations and indirectly support altered auxin transport in _PROTEIN_ root tips free indole acetic acid levels and auxin transport were not assayed . it is possible that the weak phenotype we observed for _PROTEIN_ mutants is the result of a partial redundancy of _PROTEIN_ with the other two atsnx proteins or other proteins involved in intracellular trafficking . the discovery of the wortmannin sensitive _PROTEIN_ containing endosomes and the effect of wortmannin on _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ relocalization or degradation in roots strongly indicate that _PROTEIN_ defines a novel endosomal compartment involved in auxin carrier trafficking . on the basis of the endosomal localization of _PROTEIN_ which differs from that of the _PROTEIN_ protein we propose that there are at least two distinct endosomal routes for the recycling or trafficking of auxin transport components one involving _PROTEIN_ containing endosomes _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and a second route using _PROTEIN_ containing endosomes _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . this dual option of regulating _PROTEIN_ auxin trafficking may ensure a fine control of auxin levels and auxin carriers at the subcellular level . in the past few years several studies in developmental biology using animal _METHOD_ have brought to light a complex and dynamic picture of the endosomal system . our data underline the importance of endosomal proteins in the control of growth and developmental processes in plants . identification of the other cargoes and _PROTEIN_ auxin transport components routed by the _PROTEIN_ containing endosomes and determination of developmental pathways that they regulate will be the next _PROTEIN_ for the coming years .
