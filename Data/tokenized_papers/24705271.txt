pirins are cupin fold proteins implicated in apoptosis and cellular stress in eukaryotic _METHOD_ . _PROTEIN_ plays a role in seed germination and transcription of a light and aba regulated gene under specific conditions in the model plant system arabidopsis thaliana . herein we describe that _PROTEIN_ possesses previously unreported functions that can profoundly affect early growth development and stress responses . in vitro translated _PROTEIN_ possesses quercetinase activity . when _PROTEIN_ was incubated with g protein subunit _PROTEIN_ in the inactive conformation quercetinase activity was observed . quercetinase activity was not observed when _PROTEIN_ was incubated with _PROTEIN_ in the active form _PROTEIN_ . dark grown _PROTEIN_ mutant seedlings produced more quercetin after uv induction compared to levels observed in wild type seedlings . _PROTEIN_ mutant seedlings survived a dose of high energy uv radiation that killed wt seedlings . _PROTEIN_ mutant seedlings grown for days in continuous white light display disoriented hypocotyl growth compared to wt but hypocotyls of dark grown _PROTEIN_ seedlings appeared like wt . _PROTEIN_ mutant seedlings transformed with _METHOD_ constructs containing the native _PROTEIN_ promoter and full orf _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were restored to wt responses in that they did not survive uv and there was no significant hypocotyl disorientation in response to white light . _PROTEIN_ mutants transformed with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were observed by confocal microscopy where _PROTEIN_ in the cotyledon epidermis was largely localized to the _LOCATION_ adjacent to the _LOCATION_ and diffuse and punctate _PROTEIN_ occurred within some cells . wt seedlings transformed with the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ construct exhibited widespread _PROTEIN_ in the epidermis of the cotyledon also with localization in the _LOCATION_ . _PROTEIN_ may play a critical role in cellular quercetin levels and influence light or hormonal directed early development .
based on reports that in vitro translated human and bacterial pirin could act as quercetinases _METHOD_ in vitro translated _PROTEIN_ was analyzed for the ability to cleave quercetin . utilizing the buffer of _METHOD_ and jia _METHOD_ quercetin has a reported absorbance maximum of nm which we observed herein for quercetin . upon incubation with in vitro translated _PROTEIN_ the absorbance maximum shifted to nm by min at indicating cleavage of quercetin _METHOD_ and confirming that nascent _PROTEIN_ could potentially function as a quercetinase . incubation of quercetin with the in vitro translation components alone did not result in absorbance changes . a. in vitro translated _PROTEIN_ possesses quercetinase activity . in vitro translated _PROTEIN_ was incubated with a final concentration of quercetin in a total reaction volume or as a control quercetin alone in buffer as described _METHOD_ . reactions were carried out in darkness in a water bath for min . after incubation at absorption spectra of quercetin alone quercetin _PROTEIN_ quercetin protein extract or _PROTEIN_ extract only were determined using a perkin elmer scanning spectrophotometer . n sd shown . b . the conformational status of _PROTEIN_ affects the quercetinase ability of _PROTEIN_ . in vitro translated _PROTEIN_ was pre incubated with non hydrolyzable analogs _PROTEIN_ overnight at then was incubated with _PROTEIN_ then _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was added to buffer quercetin to assess the effects on quercetinase activity as shown . absorption spectra of quercetin alone also shown . n sd shown . to address potential regulation of the quercetinase activity of the nascent _PROTEIN_ protein obtained by in vitro translation we explored the interactions between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . we pre incubated in vitro translated _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or in order to produce _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in an activated _PROTEIN_ or inactivated conformation respectively . _PROTEIN_ in the active or inactive confirmation was then incubated with in vitro translated _PROTEIN_ and quercetin . the resulting absorbance profiles indicated that _PROTEIN_ in its inactive confirmation permits quercetinase activity of _PROTEIN_ . when _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ in its active confirmation no quercetinase activity was measurable . to further explore the possible role of _PROTEIN_ as a quercetinase in plants etiolated d old arabidopsis wt and _PROTEIN_ seedlings were both irradiated by uv b then h post irradiation aerial portions of seedlings were harvested . levels of extractable hydrolyzed quercetin as well as the closely related compound kaempferol were quantified . quercetin levels in _PROTEIN_ mutants were approximately twice as high as those detected in wt while kaempferol levels remained effectively unchanged . this finding supports the results of the in vitro quercetinase assays suggesting that if _PROTEIN_ can act as a quercetinase lack of _PROTEIN_ may result in elevated quercetins in mutant seedlings since there may be no mechanism for cleavage of quercetin to _PROTEIN_ a wt level . a. _PROTEIN_ mutants accumulate more quercetin compared to wt seedlings . d old dark grown seedlings were treated with a brief pulse of uv returned to darkness then harvested h _PROTEIN_ to determine the total extractable quercetin or kaempferol in wt or _PROTEIN_ seedlings _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . the levels of q and k are indicated for _PROTEIN_ and wt and sd are shown . n b c. _PROTEIN_ mutants survive a uv c radiation treatment that kills wt seedlings . seedlings grown in complete darkness as described in methods . uv c treatments were administered on d as described with min or min of nm radiation . seedlings were returned to complete darkness for h. uv c killing doses for _PROTEIN_ or wt were determined by prior titration experimentation . seedlings were photographed from the side . n . d. _PROTEIN_ seedlings transformed with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ construct are killed by min of uv c similar to wt . seeds of wt _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ transformed with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ were sown then seedlings grown in complete darkness . uv c treatments were administered on d as described with an min dose of nm radiation . seedlings were returned to complete darkness for h. seedlings were photographed from the side . n . if young dark grown _PROTEIN_ seedlings potentially have more or accumulate more quercetin then one would expect the _PROTEIN_ mutants to exhibit improved resistance to cellular stress caused by high energy uv . we confirmed this hypothesis by using a published assay where we exposed wt and _PROTEIN_ insertion mutants to a brief dose of uv c then returned the seedlings to darkness . h after the uv c treatment wt seedlings survived while radiation sensitive _PROTEIN_ seedlings died and _PROTEIN_ mutant seedlings survived . when the uv c dose was doubled wt seedlings died and _PROTEIN_ seedlings not only survived but also exhibited increased hypocotyl shortening . _PROTEIN_ seedlings transformed with a native _PROTEIN_ promoter and _PROTEIN_ orf construct were killed by the min of uv c complementing the _PROTEIN_ mutation . since flavonoids are induced in seedlings by light we also observed the growth of _PROTEIN_ and wt seedlings grown under continuous white light for d on phytatrays . _PROTEIN_ mutants exhibited an average hypocotyl growth angle of _PROTEIN_ degrees while the wt seedlings exhibited an average of _PROTEIN_ degrees . examples of the phenotype are shown . since the kolmogorov smirnov normality test indicated that the wt and _PROTEIN_ data were not normally distributed _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ a non parametric statistical analysis was performed . we found that the _PROTEIN_ shoot growth angle was significantly different than the wt angle . the disoriented hypocotyl phenotype was complemented in _PROTEIN_ seedlings transformed by the native construct _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . no gross phenotypic differences were observed for _PROTEIN_ seedlings compared to wt seedlings from d old dark grown conditions on vertical plates . for d old light grown seedlings on vertical plates we observed a hypocotyl phenotype similar to that reported for d continuous white light _PROTEIN_ seedlings and also observed shorter roots which was complemented by transformation with the native promoter construct _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . however when wt were transformed with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ the hypocotyl phenotype was reminiscent of the deficiency _PROTEIN_ but with noticeably smaller cotyledons hypocotyl and root . three d old white light grown seedlings were photographed from the side using a dissecting microscope to compare wt and _PROTEIN_ mutant seedlings . images are representative of the range of orientations observed . scale bars each represent mm . hypocotyl angles were measured for individual seedlings in reference to the horizontal phytatray surface and mean angles were calculated . means are shown by lines _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ are represented by shaded triangles . n . _PROTEIN_ shown . subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ was explored by utilizing _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ flourescence . _PROTEIN_ mutant seedlings were transformed with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or wt seedlings were transformed with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . homozygous seedlings were grown under selection in complete darkness for d then images captured on a spinning disk confocal microscope . flourescence was visible in some cells of the epidermis of the cotyledon associated with _LOCATION_ as well as diffuse within the cell cytoplasm of some cells in _PROTEIN_ transformed with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . flourescence was greater in the transgenic plants overexpressing _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ with localization to the _LOCATION_ and diffuse and variable flourescence in the rest of the cell visible in most of the cells of the epidermis . areas of interest from images were enlarged to better observe the details over a series of z slices of _PROTEIN_ . enlargement of transformed _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ indicated _METHOD_ coinciding with dapi stain throughout the _LOCATION_ both diffuse and punctate . flourescence was also observed immediately outside of the _LOCATION_ possibly reflecting _PROTEIN_ trafficking to the _LOCATION_ or surrounding _LOCATION_ diffuse and some punctate _METHOD_ was visible elsewhere in the cells shown . some of the punctate _METHOD_ could correspond to developing _LOCATION_ as there are examples of _METHOD_ of _METHOD_ overlapping with nm which would be expected to cause etioplasts to fluoresce due to protochlorophyllides . enlargement of the results for transformed wt _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ seedling similarly revealed _METHOD_ _METHOD_ throughout the _LOCATION_ with punctate structures within the _LOCATION_ and _METHOD_ throughout the epidermal cells diffuse and punctate . like there is overlapping _METHOD_ with nm in some examples . we also performed epidermal peel samples from living non fixed cotyledons from seedlings grown d in darkness or grown under . _METHOD_ flourescence was largely found in the _LOCATION_ and was diffuse in extranuclear locations . constructs and transgenic plants are described in methods . d old dark grown _PROTEIN_ whole seedlings transformed with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or wt seedlings transformed with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were fixed stained with dapi mounted on slides then photographed on a spinning disk confocal using steady state lasers nm nm and nm . all images shown are from the cotyledon epidermis layer . panel rows are indicated by wavelength with individual channels in black and white . in the merge nm is false colored blue nm _METHOD_ is false colored green and nm is false colored red . images are

boxes on the figure indicate areas of interest and show an enlargement . red arrows indicate dapi stain in _LOCATION_ . white arrows indicate _METHOD_ accumulation in nm . untransformed wt and _PROTEIN_ seedlings are also shown on the figure . scale bars each represent . n biological replicates with at least individual seedlings viewed per replicate images are representative . microscopy and techniques are the same as described for . each row shows consecutive z slices . the red n indicates a _LOCATION_ . _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ of interest is indicated by white arrows . scale bar represents . microscopy and techniques are the same as described for . each row shows consecutive z slices . the red n indicates a _LOCATION_ . _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ of interest is indicated by white arrows . there is _PROTEIN_ in the rest of the cell largely diffuse . scale bar represents . the non coding region upstream of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ codon to the gene upstream was cloned as the _PROTEIN_ native promoter and was analyzed for regulatory elements and motifs . the motifs indicate potential roles in _PROTEIN_ metabolism hormone signaling light signaling and abiotic stress responses much of which is consistent with reported high throughput data . lapik and kaufman also described aspects of the promoter years ago showing that there were indications for light and hormone regulation specifically aba confirmed by exogenous aba regulation of the transcript and complementation . the _METHOD_ browser indicates that _PROTEIN_ is predicted to localize to the _LOCATION_ based on published experimental data and the _METHOD_ prediction method and possibly to the chloroplasts and _LOCATION_ with a low to medium confidence value . in addition _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is shown to increase in response to aba acc and abiotic signals although conditions of seedling growth varied widely in the database .
