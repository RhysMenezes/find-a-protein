acylamino acid releasing enzyme/oxidized protein hydrolase _PROTEIN_ has been biochemically demonstrated to be a bifunctional protease that has exopeptidase activity against acylated peptides and endopeptidase activity against oxidized and glycated proteins however its physiological role remains unknown . in this study to determine its physiological significance we produced _PROTEIN_ overexpressing and suppressed plants and assessed the biological impacts of _PROTEIN_ . the subcellular localization of arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ was found to be cytoplasmic and _LOCATION_ by transient _PROTEIN_ analysis of tdtomato fused arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ . overexpression of _PROTEIN_ exhibited no apparent effect on the level of oxidized proteins because wild types probably have inherently high _PROTEIN_ activity . through rnai gene suppressing we successfully produced _PROTEIN_ suppressed arabidopsis plants _PROTEIN_ that exhibited almost no _PROTEIN_ activity . in the _PROTEIN_ plant electrolyte leakage by methyl viologen treatment was enhanced compared to that of non transformant plants suggesting that the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ of _PROTEIN_ easily suffered oxidative damage probably as a result of deterioration of the cytoplasmic antioxidative system . correspondingly proteomic analysis revealed that the _PROTEIN_ plant accumulated a number of oxidized proteins including cytoplasmic antioxidant enzymes . on the basis of these results we concluded that _PROTEIN_ plays a homeostatic role in sustaining the cytoplasmic antioxidative system .
previous prediction of the n terminal amino acid sequence of _PROTEIN_ suggested that the putative localization of this protein was the microbody _LOCATION_ or mitochondria . to determine the precise intracellular localization we constructed a plasmid _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ fused with tdtomato a _METHOD_ protein and introduced the plasmid to the epidermic cell of welsh onion by particle bombardment . as a result the transient _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ fused tdtomato was recognized by an orange color along the inside of cell walls and the _LOCATION_ partly identical to _METHOD_ image of gus fused tdtomato which _PROTEIN_ in cytoplasm . hence _PROTEIN_ was localized in the cytoplasm and _LOCATION_ . we constructed a driven _PROTEIN_ overexpression plasmid and transformed tobacco plants by agrobacterium infection . after regeneration of transgenic tobacco plants we selected two lines containing a high amount of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ confirmed by immunoblotting using anti _PROTEIN_ antiserum . _PROTEIN_ and exhibited approximately twofold higher specific activity than _PROTEIN_ and an activity _PROTEIN_ with senescence . to examine the impact of overexpressed _PROTEIN_ on the level of oxidized proteins we checked the profiles of oxidized proteins in both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and found that they were similar with a lesser amount in _PROTEIN_ . similar results were obtained using arabidopsis i.e. the _PROTEIN_ activity of _PROTEIN_ overexpressing arabidopsis was approximately twofold compared to col and the profile of oxidized proteins in transgenic arabidopsis was similar to that of col . these results suggest that wild type plants have enough _PROTEIN_ activity to fulfill the physiological role of an oxidized protein scavenger . thus we concluded that overexpressed ectopic _PROTEIN_ did not affect the level of oxidized proteins . next we produced _PROTEIN_ suppressed arabidopsis plants using the rnai technique to analyze the effect of loss of _PROTEIN_ at the level of oxidized proteins . transformants were screened by genomic pcr and immunoblotting and two _PROTEIN_ suppressed lines were obtained _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . we confirmed that the amount of _PROTEIN_ proteins in both lines was reduced in particular _PROTEIN_ protein in _PROTEIN_ was undetectable . correspondingly no _PROTEIN_ activity was detected in _PROTEIN_ . therefore we used the _PROTEIN_ line for further analyses . to assess the biological impact of the suppression of _PROTEIN_ activity we examined two physiological parameters involved in typical damage by oxidative stress methyl viologen induced ion leakage and psii inhibition . ion leakage was enhanced by methyl viologen treatment in leaf discs from _PROTEIN_ than those from col . the concentration of methyl viologen used in this experiment damaged approximately of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ in col and approximately of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ in _PROTEIN_ . this suggests that damage to the protoplasmic _LOCATION_ may be defended by _PROTEIN_ probably due to the _PROTEIN_ cytoplasmic antioxidative mechanism . fv/fm of leaf discs treated with methyl viologen did not differ between col and _PROTEIN_ indicating that _PROTEIN_ was not however involved in the protection of psii against oxidative stress . this result corresponded to the localization of _PROTEIN_ i.e. cytoplasmic _PROTEIN_ could not alleviate oxidative stress in chloroplasts . _PROTEIN_ suppressed plants especially _PROTEIN_ exhibited severely suppressed _PROTEIN_ activity . as such the impact of the declined _PROTEIN_ function on the level of oxidized proteins was examined using _PROTEIN_ . for proteomic analysis we used proteins extracted from the leaves and roots of week old arabidopsis for experiments because accumulation of oxidized proteins is maximal between and weeks . both the leaves and roots of _PROTEIN_ plants contained a significant amount of oxidized proteins detected by immunochemical detection . however leaf samples were not suitable for our proteomic analysis because chloroplast proteins occupied a large part of leaf proteins masking lesser amounts of cytoplasmic and _LOCATION_ proteins major oxidized leaf proteins were assigned as chloroplast proteins . to determine the protein profile of cytoplasm in which _PROTEIN_ localizes we used root samples for further analysis of the endogenous substrate of _PROTEIN_ . root proteins were successfully separated with high resolution by two dimensional electrophoresis . to identify oxidized proteins we performed at least two experiments and reproductively detected spots were subjected to proteomic analysis . typical results are shown in fig . . protein staining with flamingo suggested that the protein patterns of col and _PROTEIN_ were not different whereas a large number of oxidized proteins were detected in _PROTEIN_ than col . we identified spots exhibiting stronger signals in _PROTEIN_ than col . unexpectedly signals of spots were stronger in col than _PROTEIN_ . the list of oxidized protein is presented in table . the oxidized proteins that increased in _PROTEIN_ plants were _PROTEIN_ cytoplasmic proteins . because these proteins were not oxidized in col they could be _PROTEIN_ as potentially oxidized proteins eliminated by _PROTEIN_ in vivo .
