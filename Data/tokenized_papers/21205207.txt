the identification of the yeast phosphatidate phosphohydrolase _PROTEIN_ gene encoding an enzyme with phosphatidate phosphatase _PROTEIN_ activity led to the discovery of mammalian lipins and subsequently to homologous genes from plants . in the present study we describe the functional characterization of arabidopsis and brassica napus homologs of _PROTEIN_ . recombinant _PROTEIN_ studies confirmed that homologous _PROTEIN_ from plants can rescue different phenotypes exhibited by the yeast _PROTEIN_ strain such as temperature growth sensitivity and atypical neutral lipid composition . using this _PROTEIN_ system we examined the role of the putative catalytic motif dxdxt and other conserved residues by mutational analysis . mutants within the _PROTEIN_ lipin domain displayed significantly _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ activity which was reflected by their limited ability to complement different phenotypes of _PROTEIN_ . subcellular localization studies using a green _METHOD_ protein fusion protein showed that arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ is mostly present in the cytoplasm of yeast cells . however upon oleic acid stimulation green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ was predominantly found in the _LOCATION_ suggesting that plant _PROTEIN_ might be involved in the transcriptional regulation of gene _PROTEIN_ . in addition we demonstrate that mutation of conserved residues that are essential for the _PROTEIN_ activity of the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ enzyme did not impair its _LOCATION_ localization in response to oleic acid . in conclusion the present study provides evidence that arabidopsis and b. napus _PROTEIN_ restore lipid synthesis in yeast and that dxdxt is a functional enzymic motif within plant _PROTEIN_ . database the nucleotide sequence data have been deposited in the genbank database under accession numbers and
based on previous studies demonstrating the involvement of yeast _PROTEIN_ and mammalian lipins in storage lipid accumulation we were initially interested in identifying arabidopsis genes encoding _PROTEIN_ enzymes that may play a role in de novo dag synthesis . two _PROTEIN_ homologs were found in arabidopsis which are designated in the present study as _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and encode proteins with predicted molecular _METHOD_ of and kda respectively . in addition we identified two _METHOD_ of b. napus _PROTEIN_ using the _PROTEIN_ sequence tag information available on the internet . they are designated in the present study as and and encode proteins sharing sequence identity and calculated molecular _METHOD_ of kda . both arabidopsis and b. napus _PROTEIN_ have the conserved and domains found in yeast _PROTEIN_ and mammalian . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ share and identity in the conserved and domain respectively . b. napus _PROTEIN_ display higher sequence identity to _PROTEIN_ at the level of for each and domain . the domain harbors the catalytic motif found in the superfamily of phosphatases . the motif dvdgt is located at positions and of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and respectively . by contrast to plant _PROTEIN_ members of the family of lpps that do not require ions for activity in arabidopsis and yeast contain a catalytic motif comprising the consensus sequences kxxxxxxrp psgh and _PROTEIN_ . analyses made with several prediction _METHOD_ were unable to detect the presence of potential transmembrane domains in arabidopsis or b. napus _PROTEIN_ . this is in agreement with earlier studies on mammalian and yeast homologs . unlike arabidopsis and b. napus _PROTEIN_ six putative transmembrane domains were predicted in arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and in yeast diacylglycerol pyrophosphate phosphatase and _PROTEIN_ that belong to the family of _PROTEIN_ enzymes . to establish the functional relationship between yeast _PROTEIN_ and the corresponding plant homologs the coding region of arabidopsis and b. napus _PROTEIN_ were linked to the _PROTEIN_ promoter in the yeast _PROTEIN_ vector which also provides an . the resulting constructs were transformed into the s. cerevisiae _PROTEIN_ strain which displays different phenotypes such as a reduced level of _PROTEIN_ activity severe growth deficiency at elevated levels of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ levels of dag and tag . transformed yeast cells were cultivated for h after induction with galactose . immunoblot analysis of yeast homogenates showed that the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ and b. napus _PROTEIN_ migrated as and kda proteins respectively upon _PROTEIN_ and these values are higher than the molecular weights of the predicted polypeptides . a similar shift in mobility was observed in yeast _PROTEIN_ and was attributed to modification of the protein by phosphorylation . _PROTEIN_ migrated at a lower molecular weight compared to _PROTEIN_ and in this case a second band is clearly noticeable on _PROTEIN_ . the same pattern has been also observed previously for mammalian . fractionation of yeast homogenate indicated that _PROTEIN_ was detected in both _LOCATION_ and soluble fractions of the yeast cell . therefore to evaluate _PROTEIN_ activity we used crude cell homogenates . the _PROTEIN_ strain _PROTEIN_ arabidopsis or b. napus _PROTEIN_ displayed a significant increase in _PROTEIN_ activity compared to the negative control transformed with lacz . the highest difference in _PROTEIN_ activity was observed for with an increase of compared to the negative control . in the _PROTEIN_ mutant the _PROTEIN_ activity was reduced by compared to the control used in the present study . this was similar to the difference between _PROTEIN_ and wt parent strain observed by han et al . . the remaining _PROTEIN_ activity in _PROTEIN_ has been attributed to other enzymes with unknown molecular identities . to evaluate the influence of arabidopsis and b. napus _PROTEIN_ in the metabolism of neutral lipids we analyzed the tag and pl content of yeast cells _PROTEIN_ recombinant _PROTEIN_ . after h of induction the tag/pl ratio in _PROTEIN_ cells bearing recombinant _PROTEIN_ was considerably higher compared to the negative control . the most pronounced effect was observed for with an increase of compared to the tag/pl ratio observed in the negative control . in addition to the effect on lipid composition yeast _PROTEIN_ cells also display reduced growth when cultivated at . to determine whether arabidopsis and b. napus _PROTEIN_ could rescue this phenotype we cultivated several dilutions of cells _PROTEIN_ plant _PROTEIN_ at . when cells were inoculated in medium supplemented with galactose lines _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ from arabidopsis and b. napus displayed growth on dilutions as low as whereas cells _PROTEIN_ lacz grew only at . in medium without galactose only wt cells presented appreciable growth indicating that complementation of phenotype resulted from arabidopsis and b. napus _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . taken together these results show that the previously characterized _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and the two _PROTEIN_ homologs from b. napus encode enzymes with _PROTEIN_ activity . previous work on mammalian lipins indicated that the _PROTEIN_ yeast _PROTEIN_ system could be used as a predictive model for confirming the functions of _PROTEIN_ genes . arabidopsis and b. napus _PROTEIN_ complemented the temperature sensitive phenotype from the yeast _PROTEIN_ strain which was also observed by nakamura et al . for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . using an escherichia coli _PROTEIN_ system eastmond et al . reported a comparatively higher enzyme activity of _PROTEIN_ over _PROTEIN_ which is corroborated by the results obtained in the present study . the higher enzyme activity of _PROTEIN_ compared to _PROTEIN_ is also evident in the preferential growth at of yeast _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ this was also reported by nakamura et al . . taken together these results collectively suggest that _PROTEIN_ can complement phenotypes of the _PROTEIN_ strain more efficiently than _PROTEIN_ . the and display relatively stronger complementation over arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ in most aspects . moreover the restoration of tag synthesis in the yeast _PROTEIN_ strain _PROTEIN_ plant _PROTEIN_ homologs suggests an evolutionary conservation of the _PROTEIN_ enzyme reaction between yeast and plants . to determine the role of the conserved residues within and domain of plant _PROTEIN_ we examined the mutational effect of selected residues on _PROTEIN_ activity using _PROTEIN_ and as models . using mutagenesis we constructed mutant _PROTEIN_ alleles and mutant alleles and _PROTEIN_ them in the _PROTEIN_ strain . yeast cells were harvested after h of induction in medium containing galactose . cell homogenates were prepared verified via immunoblotting and assayed for _PROTEIN_ activity . immunoblot analysis using serum showed that native and mutant _PROTEIN_ and enzymes were _PROTEIN_ at comparable levels . although the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ and resulted in _PROTEIN_ activity that was significantly higher compared to lacz control the corresponding mutant alleles did not restore _PROTEIN_ activity to comparable levels . in particular mutations in the predicted catalytic motif of _PROTEIN_ and abolished _PROTEIN_ activity with levels comparable to the negative control . these results are in agreement with mutational analysis of the yeast _PROTEIN_ catalytic motif and demonstrate that the conserved aspartate residues in the plant homologs are required for their catalytic function . in addition substitution of the conserved serine with alanine within domain of _PROTEIN_ had a similar negative effect on enzyme activity . the importance of the equivalent conserved serine residue for the enzyme activity in human and mouse and has been described previously . for example a rare human mutation in gene causes majeed syndrome a human inflammatory disorder . recently majeed syndrome has been linked to the loss of _PROTEIN_ activity . mutation of the conserved glycine to alanine in the domain of both _PROTEIN_ and produced less severe effects on the enzyme activity and resulted in the loss of up to and of the _PROTEIN_ activity of native enzyme respectively . interestingly other mutations in the corresponding position of _PROTEIN_ from other _METHOD_ appear to have a more pronounced effect . for example the yeast _PROTEIN_ allele showed essentially no enzyme activity . the same substitution within domain was found to be crucial for the function of in mice . mild modifications that do not result in dramatic changes in _PROTEIN_ or steric properties may not be sufficient to completely hinder enzyme activity . to determine whether the previous results with respect to enzyme activity were related to other effects on lipid metabolism we examined the yeast lipid composition in stationary phase of _PROTEIN_ cells _PROTEIN_ mutant alleles of _PROTEIN_ and . as demonstrated previously the tag/pl ratio in the _PROTEIN_ strain was increased by the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ and genes . however the _PROTEIN_ of their respective mutant alleles within domain did not affect tag/pl ratio compared to the negative control . similarly the _PROTEIN_ of mutant _PROTEIN_ and mutant alleles did not complement the temperature sensitivity of _PROTEIN_ cells at . the effect of the mutation in appears to be comparatively mild and might be attributed to unique attributes of together with a more conservative change as outlined above . in conclusion amino acid substitutions in the conserved domain including the motif of _PROTEIN_ and resulted in the loss of _PROTEIN_ activity . mutation of in the domain also produced a significant reduction in enzyme activity and was less severe for . the results obtained from temperature growth sensitivity analysis correlated with changes in lipid composition in the _PROTEIN_ strain and indicate a close relationship between enzyme activity and the different phenotypes . the findings of the present study are in agreement with earlier mutational analysis studies carried out with yeast _PROTEIN_ . furthermore in the study performed by han et al . the lack of complementation by the _PROTEIN_ and mutant _PROTEIN_ alleles was linked to the specific loss of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ activity . we have previously determined that plant _PROTEIN_ homologs are present in both soluble and _LOCATION_ fractions of yeast cells . to obtain a more comprehensive understanding of the subcellular localization of these enzymes we prepared a construct encoding an green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ with _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ this construct in _PROTEIN_ under the control of the _PROTEIN_ promoter . as shown in fig . the _METHOD_ fusion was present throughout the cytoplasm as a soluble protein in agreement with the immunoblot on fig . and apparently absent in the _LOCATION_ . previous localization studies using yeast _METHOD_ fusions also indicated that _PROTEIN_ was present throughout the cytoplasm . confocal microscopy of _METHOD_ fusion _PROTEIN_ in nicotiana benthamiana leaves indicated that the fusion protein was located predominantly in the _LOCATION_ . in the case of mammalian _PROTEIN_ homologs both mouse _METHOD_ can localize to either the _LOCATION_ or _LOCATION_ . the majority of is present in the _LOCATION_ and the remaining is prevalent in the _LOCATION_ of mature adipocytes . _PROTEIN_ activity is primarily _LOCATION_ but after fatty acid stimulation it can be largely detected in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ as described previously in rat hepatocytes as well as in the developing seeds of safflower following stimulation with oleic acid . the yeast _PROTEIN_ system used in the present study offers the versatility of controlling environmental conditions and stimuli . therefore we aimed to determine whether oleic acid supplementation could affect the subcellular localization of _METHOD_ . when cells were cultivated in the presence of oleic acid _METHOD_ was found almost exclusively in the _LOCATION_ . this suggests that _PROTEIN_ might be involved in transcriptional gene regulation although additional studies are required to address this hypothesis . we have shown that conserved residues and are essential for _PROTEIN_ activity of arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ . to determine the significance of these conserved residues for _LOCATION_ localization we introduced point mutations into a _METHOD_ fusion at the respective sites of _PROTEIN_ and investigated whether they exhibited _LOCATION_ localization . as shown in fig . f _METHOD_ mutant alleles localized to the _LOCATION_ of yeast cells cultivated in the presence of oleic acid . these results demonstrated that conserved amino acid residues and are required for _PROTEIN_ activity of _PROTEIN_ although they are not required for _LOCATION_ localization . previously et al . indicated that yeast _PROTEIN_ could also play a role in transcriptional regulation of pl synthesis . in addition mammalian has been also suggested to act as a transcriptional in the regulation of lipid metabolism gene _PROTEIN_ . similar to the findings of the present study donkor et al . have shown that the equivalent serine residue in mouse and was required for _PROTEIN_ activity although it was not required for transcriptional function . the results obtained in the present study suggest that similar _METHOD_ of _PROTEIN_ trafficking to the _LOCATION_ might also be present in plants . eastmond et al . determined that the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ is considerably higher in developing seeds where a substantial flux of fas to tag occurs . similar analyses carried out in our laboratory corroborate these findings . however analysis of lipids from seeds of an arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ double knockout showed that tag content was not substantially reduced relative to wt . therefore although mrna accumulation suggests that _PROTEIN_ might have a key function in seeds their role in storage lipid metabolism remains unclear .
a. thaliana plants were cultivated in a growth chamber at with an h photoperiod . a. thaliana _PROTEIN_ orf was amplified from a cdna clone obtained from the arabidopsis biological resource center using primers and _PROTEIN_ and ligated into the yeast _PROTEIN_ vector at the kpni and noti restriction sites . a. thaliana _PROTEIN_ orf was amplified using a cdna preparation from developing seeds with primers and and then ligated into the vector at the bamhi and noti sites . under the control of the _PROTEIN_ promoter the _PROTEIN_ genes in the yeast vector were _PROTEIN_ as an fusion protein to the xpress epitope and polyhistidine tag . b. napus _PROTEIN_ were isolated using sequence information identified in ests database . these partial b. napus _PROTEIN_ homolog sequences were used to design primers to amplify the and ends of the cdna using the smart _PROTEIN_ cdna amplification kit and a cdna preparation from b. napus developing seeds . after sequence assembly to determine the sequence of the cdna the orf was amplified using the primer and and subsequently cloned into the kpni and noti sites of _PROTEIN_ vector . the arabidopsis and b. napus _PROTEIN_ in were transformed into s. cerevisiae mutant strain _PROTEIN_ using the s. c. easycomp transformation kit . for yeast cells the _PROTEIN_ mutant and wt transformed with plasmid designated as lacz and wt in the present study were used as controls . the transformants were selected and grown as described previously . briefly yeast cultures were cultivated in minimal medium containing yeast nitrogen base raffinose adenine arginine tryptophan methionine histidine and tyrosine lysine and leucine . the cultures were grown at in a rotary shaker at r.p.m . _PROTEIN_ of the recombinant genes was induced using minimal medium containing galactose and raffinose . to introduce point mutations into the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ coding region a mutagenesis kit was used . the primers used were and . the primers used to introduce a point mutation into were and _PROTEIN_ . primers were complementary to opposite strands of yeast _PROTEIN_ vector containing either the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ or b. napus _PROTEIN_ gene . the presence of the desired mutation was confirmed by dna sequencing . to prepare the _METHOD_ fusion the coding sequences of _METHOD_ and arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ were pcr amplified separately using pfx platinum polymerase which was used for all pcr reactions in the present study . the _METHOD_ fragment was generated by pcr with primers and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ fragment was amplified with primers _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ . the resulting amplicons were combined with primers and _PROTEIN_ and then cloned into the kpni and noti sites of . point mutations and at the corresponding sites of arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ coding region in _METHOD_ fusion construct were introduced with primers as described above using mutagenesis kit and their presence was confirmed by dna sequencing . total protein was separated onto an _PROTEIN_ gel using standard protocols . after electrophoresis proteins were electrotransferred to poly _LOCATION_ using a mini apparatus and transfer buffer _PROTEIN_ . serum was used at a dilution of . the proteins were detected using the amersham ecl plus western blotting detection kit . the _METHOD_ signal was detected with the tyhoon imaging system . total rna was isolated from arabidopsis tissues with the rneasy kit and used to synthesize cdna with the superscript ii reverse transcriptase followed by rnase h treatment . the product of these reactions was used for quantitative using the platinum sybr green qpcr in accordance with the manufacturer s instructions . pcr was performed in a fast pcr system _METHOD_ and efficiency was calculated through serial dilutions of the initial amount of rna . the relative _PROTEIN_ level was calculated using the comparative ct method after normalizing to controls using three reference genes with stable _PROTEIN_ levels in arabidopsis . the pair of primers used for each reference gene was _GENE_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _GENE_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _GENE_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . total lipids were extracted from induced yeast cells by the method of bligh and dyer . the internal standards of and triheptadecanoin were added to each sample to permit quantitative fatty acid analysis . lipid extracts were separated by tlc on silica gel plates _PROTEIN_ using the solvent system hexane/diethyl ether/glacial acetic acid . lipid classes were visualized under uv after spraying with primuline solution . spots corresponding to tag and pl were scraped out and transmethylated with m methanolic hcl at for h. the fatty acid methyl esters were extracted with hexane and dried under . finally fames were resuspended in ml of with an internal standard . fames were analyzed on an gas chromatograph with a inert xl _METHOD_ selective detector equipped with an auto sampler . fames were separated using a capillary column with a constant helium flow of and the temperature program hold for min to hold min and to hold min . integration events were detected and identified between and min and compared against a chromatography standard . yeast homogenates were prepared essentially as described by han et al . . briefly cells were harvested and washed with ml of isolation buffer pelleted by centrifugation and resuspended in of isolation buffer . all buffers were with _PROTEIN_ ion exchange resin na salt form to minimize the presence of . cells were broken using three pulses with a beadbeatertm using mm glass beads . the homogenate was collected and briefly centrifuged to remove unbroken cells . the protein concentration of each lysate preparation was determined using the method . for the _PROTEIN_ enzyme assay initially we used the procedure described by han et al . . essentially this procedure was designed to study the kinetic of purified _PROTEIN_ using a surface dilution kinetic model in which _PROTEIN_ is dispersed in micelles of triton . the activity which distinguishes _PROTEIN_ from lpp activity was approximately half of the total activity and therefore our differential assay was subject to a larger _LOCATION_ than anticipated . we then compared this assay with one that we had designed to measure _PROTEIN_ in homogenates of mammalian cells . this latter assay maximizes the level of _PROTEIN_ activity and _PROTEIN_ that of lpp activity . our optimized assay system contained in a final volume of ml mm tris buffer ph mm tetrahydrolipstatin fatty bovine serum albumin and mm _PROTEIN_ labeled with palmitate which was dispersed in mm phosphatidylcholine and mm edta plus mm egta that was used to prepare the lipid substrate . was removed from all buffers by treating with _PROTEIN_ ion exchange resin na salt form . reactions were stopped after incubation at with ml of chloroform containing olive oil as a carrier for neutral lipids . next g of basic alumina was added to absorb the _PROTEIN_ and any palmitate formed by phospholipase a type activities . the tubes were centrifuged and ml of the chloroform which contained the dag product was dried and quantified by scintillation counting . the times of incubation were adjusted so that < of the _PROTEIN_ was consumed during the incubation . total _PROTEIN_ activities were calculated from measurements at three different protein concentrations to ensure the proportionality of the assay . parallel incubations were performed in the absence of to block _PROTEIN_ activity and to measure the lpp activity which had to be subtracted from the total to give the _PROTEIN_ activity . this method gave greater total activity than the triton micelle assay . the lpp activity was only of the total activity . therefore this assay provided us with a more accurate method of determining _PROTEIN_ activity in homogenates where the measurement of kinetic constants was not required . yeast _PROTEIN_ cells _PROTEIN_ the _METHOD_ fusion were induced for h using minimal medium containing galactose raffinose ethanol/tyloxapol without or with supplementation with oleic acid . a leica multiphoton confocal laser scanning microscope _METHOD_ was used to examine the subcellular localization of _METHOD_ fusions in yeast cells . for the imaging of _METHOD_ a nm laser excitation was used at and nm emission . _LOCATION_ were identified by dna staining with dilactate . briefly of fresh cell suspension were mixed with of glycerol containing of dapi . the mix was placed onto specimen slides covered with a cover glass and visualized immediately . imaging of dapi was conducted using a nm laser excitation at and nm emission . data were acquired using a hcx pl apo objective .
