an activation tagging methodology was applied to dedifferentiated calli of arabidopsis to identify new genes involved in salt tolerance . this identified salt tolerant callus as a gene encoding the basic helix loop helix transcription _PROTEIN_ . knockout lines were more sensitive to nacl kcl licl aba and low temperatures than the wild type . back transformation of the ko line rescued its phenotype and over _PROTEIN_ of in differentiated plants exhibited tolerance to nacl . green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ fused with revealed that it was localized to the _LOCATION_ . prepared protein was subjected to electrophoresis mobility shift assays against e box sequences _PROTEIN_ . the g box sequence cacgtg had the strongest interaction with . ox lines were transcriptomically analyzed and resultant up and down regulated genes selected on the criterion of presence of a g box sequence . there were genes positively regulated by and genes negatively regulated these genes possessed one or more g box sequences in their promoter regions . many of these genes are known to be involved in abiotic stress response . it is concluded that locates at a branching point in the abiotic stress response network by interacting directly to the g box in genes conferring salt tolerance on plants .
numerous efforts have been made to identify salt stress regulatory components using whole plants . this study however focused on identification of mutants at the cellular level as the employment of differentiated plants may interfere with analysis this is due to the variety of complex structures and tissue specific processes . to investigate salt tolerance at the cellular level roots of the arabidopsis were infected with agrobacterium tumefaciens harboring the binary vector this contains four copies of a bp long cauliflower mosaic virus enhancer at the right border of the t dna and a gene for the selectable marker acetolactate synthase as . transformants were selected on callus inducing medium supplemented with chlorsulfuron a primary compound of sulfonylurea and subsequently screened on mm nacl containing medium where calli of the wild type died . starting from about activation tagged calli stc mutants were identified . the mutant line which showed the phenotype more significantly tolerant to salt was subjected to further molecular characterization . t dna integration was confirmed by pcr analysis of chlorsulfuron resistant calli using t dna specific primers . the pcr generated a bp fragment the same size as the product amplified from thereby confirming the transformation . to determine the location of t dna integration and activated genes tail pcr was performed for mutant using primers from both ends of the t dna and arbitrary degenerate primers . sequences obtained from tail pcr analyses were subjected to a blast search at ncbi and the location of the t dna marked . specific primers were designed based on the tail pcr sequences and used in combination with t dna specific primers to confirm the insertion sites within the arabidopsis genome . in the mutant tail pcr confirmed the presence of only one t dna located on chromosome . the t dna was present between and . encoding was located at a distance of base pairs from the border of t dna . integrated location point of t dna for activation in chromosome . _PROTEIN_ of encoding and encoding _PROTEIN_ . total rna was extracted from calli grown on cim supplemented with mm nacl . _PROTEIN_ was determined by real time rt pcr and normalized using _PROTEIN_ and shown as ratios of transcript levels to those of the wild type without salt . _LOCATION_ bars represent from four experimental replicates . here are n.s. for no significant difference and for p < in _PROTEIN_ . enhancer sequences within the activation tagging vectors may enhance constitutive or ectopic _PROTEIN_ and the majority of enhanced genes are reported as being located adjacent to the t dna . enhancer sequences may elevate _PROTEIN_ at both ends of the t dna and are known to enhance gene _PROTEIN_ up to kbp away independent of orientation . transcript levels of genes adjacent to the t dna and kbp flanking regions of the t dna were examined in calli grown on cim in the absence or presence of mm nacl . rt pcr revealed that transcripts were or times greater with or without mm nacl respectively in the mutant in comparison with the wild type times higher in the mutant than the wild type with salt which dramatically reduced the transcript in the wild type . transcripts for another gene locating near the inserted t dna cdpk related kinase _PROTEIN_ were elevated or times with or without nacl in the mutant compared with the wild type and times in the mutant than the wild type with salt . two kinds of ko lines and designated hereafter as and respectively were analyzed . transcripts for were at levels and fold in and lines compared with the wild type respectively . homozygous lines of and exhibited more sensitive phenotype to salt than that of the wild type and _PROTEIN_ ko which was a knockout line of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ encoding a putative zn finger containing tf employed as the control in which an unrelated gene was knocked out . in the ox construct is driven by the camv promoter . the introduction of this construct into the line rescued the phenotype of the ko line in the criterion of leaf extent on salt containing culture medium . these results indicated that caused the mutant phenotype . to further confirm that activation of caused the salt tolerant phenotype the wild type was transformed with the ox construct . transcripts for were approximately and times higher in and lines than in the wild type . the ox lines were significantly tolerant to salt with _PROTEIN_ to the fresh weights of shoots . integrated locations of t dna for gene disruption at

medium containing different concentrations of aba for weeks . the percentages are surviving rates of employed lines in comparison with their survival on the standard _METHOD_ medium without aba . a construct containing fused at its c terminus to green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ was transiently bombarded into onion epidermal cells . the fusion protein was located in the _LOCATION_ suggesting that may work as a tf . this intercellular localization is also supported by the typical bhlh structure which may interact with dna and its function governing the up or down regulation of multiple genes in ox lines . the construct of fused with _METHOD_ was bombarded into onion epidermal cells . transient _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ was observed . bombarded with _METHOD_ alone construct . bombarded with fused with _METHOD_ . the hexa nucleotide e box sequence _PROTEIN_ where the two central nucleotides are variable is the core dna motif recognized by most bhlh proteins . one of the most common sequences for the e box is the palindromic g box cacgtg . within the basic region of proteins certain conserved amino acids provide identification of the core consensus site while other residues in the domain dictate specificity for a given type of e box . furthermore flanking nucleotides outside of the hexa nucleotide core play an important role in binding specificity . there is evidence that a loop residue in proteins plays a role in dna binding through elements outside of the core recognition sequence . as is a bhlh family tf it is feasible that its bhlh domain may recognize e box or g box core sequences . to determine whether core hexa nucleotides were recognized by a strategy based on _PROTEIN_ recognized myc sequences all possible combinations of myc sequences was used . the _PROTEIN_ regulator _PROTEIN_ which recognizes five different myc sequences present in _PROTEIN_ promoter regions was used to design all possible myc combinations of the core six nucleotides recognized by bhlh proteins . interactions were examined by electrophoresis mobility shift assay _METHOD_ . nucleotide sequences of regions containing a possible g box were employed for _METHOD_ as probes . thirteen kinds of mer g box sequences consisting of c/ga/gnnt/g/ag/c and arbitrary degenerate probes _PROTEIN_ . the and denote the presence or absence of protein in _METHOD_ . competition experiments using the cacgtg sequences against the protein . to produce protein for electrophoresis mobility shift assays _METHOD_ we cloned cdna into pmal as a form fused at its n terminus to maltose binding protein mbp . escherichia coli rosetta cells were transformed with the construct and mbp purified using maltose binding resin . the apmyc probes and two negative control probes were designed and annealed using pcr . recognized probe which comprised the cacgtg core nucleotides of the g box in the _METHOD_ . no other nucleotide probes interacted with including the controls consisting of arbitrary degenerate sequences . competition assays using different probes further revealed that recognized the g box . to further confirm that recognizes the g box cacgtg sequence was introduced into probes and to generate and . all three probes possessing cacgtg sequence interacted with and competed with the probe demonstrating that specifically interacts with the cacgtg sequence of the g box . the interaction of to and was weaker than seen with . therefore flanking sequences outside the g box may affect the strength of interaction . the gc content of flanking sequences likely influences the strength of interaction as the strongest interaction was observed with which possesses gc rich flanking regions . encodes a bhlh protein which acts as tf . to analyze genome wide targets of microarray analysis of wild type and transgenic ox lines of was performed . out of probes present on the _PROTEIN_ genechip genes in the ox lines were up regulated to more than double levels of the wild type and genes in the ox lines were down regulated to levels lower than a half that . these genes were analyzed for the presence of a g box consensus sequence in their promoter regions to a distance of kbp upstream of each gene . among the up regulated genes genes were direct targets of the position of the g box present in the promoters were marked . out of down regulated genes had g box in their promoter region and were thus directly down regulated by . in the computation analysis of the microarray data of all arabidopsis genes were significantly up regulated by while of genes were down regulated . these results indicate that preferably act as a positive regulator . following the criterion that they contained g box sequences in their promoter regions of up regulated genes and of down regulated genes were directed by . analysis of these up and down regulated genes revealed that many were salt aba jasmonic acid and cold responsive indicating that plays an important role in multiple abiotic stresses . chromosome distribution analyses of the directly up regulated targets revealed that the maximum number of direct targets of occurred on chromosome followed by on chromosome on chromosome and on chromosome . chromosome had the least targets with only . the down regulated genes were fairly evenly distributed on chromosomes and with and targets on each respectively . similarly to the distribution of up regulated genes chromosome had the least number of targets . overall the number of genes positively regulated by was five times greater than that of those down regulated . to confirm the direct interaction of with the g box of up or down regulated genes identified from the microarray data of ox lines we randomly selected promoter sequences . a set of mer probes were designed with nine bases flanking each side of the g box and _METHOD_ performed . the _METHOD_ results showed that specifically recognized every g box in the analyzed promoters . as before the strength of the interaction signal was influenced by the flanking region sequence . together these results indicated that interacts with the g box in promoters of both positively and negatively regulated genes . directly regulated genes positively and genes negatively . the up regulated genes were classified into different groups on the basis of functions salt stress regulated genes cold or drought responsive genes iron ion transport response or regulated genes protein kinase genes _PROTEIN_ tfs zn finger protein genes aba or salicylic acid responsive genes ethylene responsive genes cytochrome genes protein phosphatase genes jasmonic acid biosynthesis metabolism or responsive genes and wrky family tf genes . the down regulated genes included salt cold and drought responsive genes . directly regulated genes possessing g box sequences positively and genes containing g box ones negatively . the up regulated genes are classified into different groups on the basis of functions . the down regulated genes are categorized into abiotic stress responsive ones and the others . the number at each gene group is that of members . the arrow shows positive regulation and the arrow
