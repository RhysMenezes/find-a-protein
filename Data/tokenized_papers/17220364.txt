plant morphogenesis is profoundly influenced by light . for example light inhibits seedling hypocotyl growth via activation of phytochromes and additional photoreceptors . subsequently information is transmitted through photoreceptor linked signal transduction pathways and used _METHOD_ to control hypocotyl growth . here we show that light inhibition of arabidopsis hypocotyl growth is in part dependent on the dellas _LOCATION_ . we show that light inhibition of growth is reduced in della deficient mutant hypocotyls . we also show that light activation of phytochromes promotes the accumulation of dellas . a green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ tagged della _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ accumulates in elongating cells of light grown but not dark grown transgenic wild type hypocotyls . furthermore transfer of seedlings from light to dark results in rapid changes in hypocotyl _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ accumulation changes that are paralleled by rapid alterations in the abundance in hypocotyls of transcripts encoding enzymes of ga metabolism . these observations suggest that light dependent changes in hypocotyl _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ accumulation are a consequence of light dependent changes in bioactive ga level . finally we show that _METHOD_ accumulation and quantitative modulation of hypocotyl growth is proportionate with light energy dose . hence dellas inhibit hypocotyl growth during the light phase of the day night cycle via a mechanism that is quantitatively responsive to natural light variability . we conclude that dellas are a major component of the _PROTEIN_ significant mechanism via which light regulates plant growth during photomorphogenesis .
we further investigated the relationship between ga and light in the regulation of hypocotyl growth in experiments using the arabidopsis mutant . whereas wild type seedlings grown in continuous light had shorter hypocotyls than dark grown controls the differences between light and dark grown mutant hypocotyl lengths were considerably smaller . furthermore hypocotyls grown in continuous light were of similar length to wild type controls whereas dark grown hypocotyls were markedly shorter than dark grown wild type hypocotyls . thus ga plays a particularly prominent role in the regulation of hypocotyl growth in the dark . ga promotes many aspects of the growth of plants by targeting the growth restraining dellas for destruction in the cellular proteasome thus overcoming della restraint of growth . to determine whether ga promotes hypocotyl growth by this same mechanism we studied multiple mutant lines that are substantially lacking in della function . the arabidopsis genome encodes five dellas _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . the quadruple della mutant line lacks _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ whereas the quadruple della line lacks the same set of dellas on the background . we found that continuous light grown quadruple della and quadruple della mutant hypocotyls grew to approximately twice the length of wild type and controls . furthermore substantial lack of della function completely suppressed the short hypocotyl phenotype of dark grown seedlings . thus della function restrains hypocotyl growth in both light and dark . in nature plants are exposed to the alternating periods of light and darkness that correspond to the day night cycle . we next found that dellas inhibit hypocotyl growth to a degree proportionate to daylength . whereas wild type and quadruple della mutant hypocotyl length was identical in darkness the difference in hypocotyl length between these two lines increases progressively with increase in daylength . conversely whereas the lengths of and wild type hypocotyls were very different in darkness the difference in hypocotyl length between these two lines _PROTEIN_ progressively as daylength increases . thus in wild type plants increases in daylength cause increases in both hypocotyl growth inhibition and the relative contribution that della restraint makes to that inhibition . conversely in ga deficient plants increases in daylength progressively reduce the growth inhibitory effects of ga deficiency on hypocotyl growth suggesting that ga becomes less critical for hypocotyl growth as the light period increases . we next showed that della dependent light induced hypocotyl growth inhibition is associated with della accumulation . prga _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ seedlings _PROTEIN_ a _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion protein that is detectable in root cell _LOCATION_ and destroyed rapidly in response to ga treatment . because light inhibits hypocotyl growth via a della dependent mechanism we determined the effect of light on _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in _LOCATION_ of elongating cells of the hypocotyl . we found that _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ attributable to _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was readily detectable in the elongation zone of hypocotyls of light grown prga _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ seedlings but not in hypocotyls of dark grown controls . these observations suggest that _PROTEIN_ accumulates in _LOCATION_ of elongation zone cells in light grown wild type hypocotyls thus contributing to light mediated inhibition of hypocotyl growth . in contrast _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was clearly detectable in both light grown and dark grown prga _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ hypocotyls . the consistency of these observations with the previous hypocotyl growth data suggests that wild type and hypocotyls are of similar length when grown in continuous light because they sustain a similar level of della accumulation . conversely dark grown wild type and hypocotyls are of different lengths largely because dellas accumulate in dark grown hypocotyls but not in wild type controls . in subsequent experiments we determined the kinetics of change in a detectable level of _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ following transfer of plants from light to dark . we found that _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in hypocotyl _LOCATION_ had largely disappeared within h of transfer of prga _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ seedlings from light to dark and that _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ remained undetectable during subsequent hours of darkness . conversely hypocotyls of dark grown seedlings began to exhibit detectable _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ within h of onset of light exposure with subsequent increase in _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ level that plateaued at h and beyond . thus the rate at which _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ is destroyed in darkness appears to be faster than the rate at which it accumulates in the light . these dynamic light dependent changes in _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ level are not seen in prga _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ hypocotyls presumably because they are dependent on the modulation of ga level . in addition we found that these effects of light on _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ accumulation were a consequence of light itself and were not circadian clock dependent . we confirmed that the increase in hypocotyl cell _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ that occurred following transfer of seedlings from dark to light was genuinely associated with an increase in _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ protein level via immunodetection of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . this experiment revealed a progressive increase in the level of immunologically detectable _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ that was proportionate to the duration of light exposure . reduced bioactive ga level causes an increase in della accumulation and consequent growth inhibition . we next investigated the possibility that light induced accumulation of dellas in seedling hypocotyls might be the result of light induced effects on ga metabolism thus causing a reduction in the levels of bioactive ga . indeed several previous reports indicate that light affects ga metabolism via modulation of the levels of gene transcripts encoding ga biosynthesis enzymes . bioactive ga levels are increased by increasing the level of transcripts encoding ga oxidase _PROTEIN_ and ga oxidase _PROTEIN_ enzymes that catalyze successive steps in the synthesis of bioactive ga . conversely bioactive ga levels are reduced by increasing the level of transcripts encoding ga oxidase _PROTEIN_ an enzyme that deactivates bioactive ga . previous experiments have shown that light regulates ga metabolism genes during arabidopsis seed germination . we therefore determined the effects of light on the accumulation of selected ga metabolism gene transcripts in arabidopsis seedling hypocotyls . we found that hypocotyls grown in the dark accumulate relatively high levels of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and low levels of _PROTEIN_ transcripts . conversely when grown in continuous light hypocotyls contain relatively high amounts of _PROTEIN_ transcripts _PROTEIN_ and accumulate relatively low levels of _PROTEIN_ . these observations indicate that the biosynthesis and accumulation of bioactive ga is promoted in dark grown seedling hypocotyls _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ whereas deactivation of bioactive ga is promoted in dark grown seedling hypocotyls _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . thus in dark grown hypocotyls the relatively high level of bioactive ga targets dellas for destruction and promotes hypocotyl growth . conversely in light grown hypocotyls the relatively low level of bioactive ga favors della accumulation thus promoting repression of hypocotyl growth . we also examined the dynamics of ga metabolism gene transcript levels in seedlings transferred from dark to light . movement of seedlings from dark to light resulted within h in pronounced accumulation of _PROTEIN_ transcripts _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and a corresponding _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ transcript levels in seedling hypocotyls . this sudden change in gene transcript levels presumably has two consequences . first the increase in _PROTEIN_ transcript levels results in rapid deactivation of the bioactive ga that was produced during the preceding dark period . second the _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ transcript levels reduces the production of further active ga . previous work has shown that increased della activity results in increased levels of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ transcripts due to perturbation of a della dependent negative feedback loop . it is possible that the slight increase in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ transcript levels observed between and h of light exposure is due to such a mechanism . however the light/dark mediated sudden changes in levels of ga metabolism gene transcripts described above are consistent with the hypothesis that light dependent changes in bioactive ga level contribute to the della dependent effect of light on hypocotyl growth . in addition to the above described changes in ga metabolism the light mediated _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ accumulation demonstrated in figure might also have been the consequence of light dependent modulation of the levels of transcripts encoding components of the ga signaling pathway . as outlined in the introduction ga is perceived by receptors thus enhancing the affinity between the dellas and a specific scf ubiquitin ligase complex involving the f box proteins _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and promoting the eventual destruction of dellas in the proteasome . we therefore analyzed the accumulation of transcripts encoding _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in dark and light grown seedlings . as shown in figure exposure to light or dark had no detectable effect on the levels to which these transcripts accumulated . thus the accumulation of the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ signal in light treated seedlings is unlikely to be due to light induced enhancement of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ transcript levels or to a _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ transcript levels . we next began to characterize those regions of the light spectrum that contribute to della dependent light mediated inhibition of hypocotyl growth first assaying the fr and r light regions of the spectrum that are particularly associated with the phytochrome family of photoreceptors . as shown previously for continuous white light we found that quadruple della mutant hypocotyls were longer than wild type hypocotyls in both fr and r . furthermore the short hypocotyl phenotype exhibited by in r was suppressed in the quadruple della line . thus there is a della dependent component to the mechanism via which both r and fr inhibit hypocotyl growth . the _PROTEIN_ photoreceptor is the predominant detector of fr during seedling hypocotyl growth . accordingly _PROTEIN_ loss of function mutant hypocotyls are longer than wild type hypocotyls in fr . to further characterize the role of dellas in _PROTEIN_ mediated hypocotyl growth inhibition we studied the ga response mutant gai . the gai mutant allele encodes a mutant gai form of _PROTEIN_ that is relatively resistant to the effects of ga and thus constitutively represses growth . the length of fr grown _PROTEIN_ gai double mutant hypocotyls was intermediate between that of _PROTEIN_ and gai . thus the constitutive growth repression conferred by gai reduces fr grown _PROTEIN_ mutant hypocotyl growth further indicating that fr activation of _PROTEIN_ inhibits hypocotyl growth via a mechanism that contains a della dependent component . the _PROTEIN_ that fr grown gai and _PROTEIN_ gai hypocotyls are not of identical length indicates the existence of an additional della independent mechanism via which activated _PROTEIN_ inhibits hypocotyl growth . in further experiments we determined the effect of the _PROTEIN_ mediated fr signal on the accumulation of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ accumulated to higher levels in fr treated prga _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ seedlings than in fr treated _PROTEIN_ prga _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ seedlings thus indicating that fr modulation of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ levels is at least partially _PROTEIN_ dependent . whereas _PROTEIN_ inhibits hypocotyl growth in fr _PROTEIN_ plays a predominant role in inhibition of hypocotyl growth in r and white light . we next investigated the role of _PROTEIN_ in the della dependent light mediated inhibition of seedling hypocotyl growth using the _PROTEIN_ mutant _PROTEIN_ . in these experiments we compared the kinetics of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ accumulation following the transfer of prga _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ prga _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ seedlings from the dark to white light . whereas immunodetectable _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ levels did not obviously increase in _PROTEIN_ prga _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ hypocotyls in the period between and h following onset of light exposure prga _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ seedlings displayed a large increase in _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ level during this period . thus lack of _PROTEIN_ delays light induced accumulation of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . taken together the above results indicate that an activated phytochrome _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ contributes to the light promoted accumulation of dellas . in turn della accumulation promotes light mediated hypocotyl growth inhibition . the natural light environment varies with respect to photoperiod duration and fluence rate the total light dose that plants receive being the product of these two variables . we next investigated the effect of variation in fluence rate on light mediated della dependent hypocotyl growth inhibition by comparing the growth of wild type and quadruple della mutant seedling hypocotyls in different fluence rates of continuous light . at low fluence rate we found that wild type hypocotyls were a little shorter than quadruple della mutant hypocotyls . as fluence rate increased wild type hypocotyls became progressively shorter than quadruple della mutant hypocotyls such that at high fluence rate wild type hypocotyls were considerably shorter than quadruple della hypocotyls . thus the della dependent component of light mediated hypocotyl growth inhibition becomes increasingly prominent with increased fluence rate . we next investigated the combined effect of variation in fluence rate and photoperiod duration on hypocotyl growth and found that the wild type/quadruple della hypocotyl length ratio _PROTEIN_ proportionately with an increase in light energy dose . for example the wild type/quadruple della hypocotyl length ratio was approximately the same when seedlings were exposed to for an h photoperiod or for a h photoperiod different combinations of fluence rate and exposure duration that result in the same energy dose . in contrast when the photoperiod was _PROTEIN_ but the fluence rate increased fold the wild type/quadruple della hypocotyl length ratio _PROTEIN_ fold . thus the degree to which dellas contribute to hypocotyl growth inhibition is proportionate to the light energy dose . in accord with this conclusion we found that accumulation of immunodetectable _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was also proportionate to light dose . for example the degree of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ accumulation remained the same when the photoperiod was increased fold and fluence rate halved . conversely _PROTEIN_ of photoperiod with increase in fluence rate resulted in a clearly detectable increase in immunodetectable _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . taken together the observations in figure indicate that dellas accumulate in quantitative proportion to the light energy to which seedlings are exposed and that dellas therefore contribute to light mediated inhibition of hypocotyl growth in a light dose dependent fashion .
all experiments used the landsberg _LOCATION_ laboratory strain of arabidopsis as genetic background . the gai quadruple della _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ quadruple della prga _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ lines were as described previously . the _PROTEIN_ gai _PROTEIN_ prga _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ prga _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and prga _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ lines were isolated from progeny of the appropriate crosses . all seeds were surface sterilized and placed on germination medium plates at for d to synchronize germination . for experiments involving all lines were ga treated _PROTEIN_ for d at then washed three times with distilled water before sterilization . subsequently plates were placed in vertical orientation in controlled environment chambers for d in darkness before transfer to white or r light at . after d plates were scanned and hypocotyl length was measured using image j software or sigmascan pro software . fr growth experiments were performed as previously described . for each set of experiments at least seedlings were measured . _METHOD_ due to _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in the _LOCATION_ of cells of the elongation zone of seedling hypocotyls was determined as follows . prga _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ containing lines were grown on gm plates for d in darkness and subsequently either _PROTEIN_ in the dark or transferred to white light for d. seedlings were then exposed to dark or light for the time as indicated before observation of hypocotyls by confocal microscopy . total rna was obtained from hypocotyls of d old seedlings grown on gm in either continuous white light or darkness . seedlings were then transferred to dark or white light for the time as indicated . total rna was extracted using _PROTEIN_ reagent . generation of complementary dna pcr amplification and blot analyses were as described previously . the primer pairs used for pcr amplification were as previously described or as follows _PROTEIN_ cgcaagcagtttcaccggac and gagctgcttgcaccgggcgg _PROTEIN_ catcacctcaactactgcga and tcacctgtaccgaagctggt _PROTEIN_ ccgaggaacacacttagcaag and ggcttcaacaattcgaaagg _PROTEIN_ gagtgactcgtgcctgagac and ccttgtatgagagtagtcat _PROTEIN_ tggtagaggaagagctaaag and ctaagcttggtgactatagg _PROTEIN_ gcgcagtactaccgactctg and cgagaagatgagtttcactaag _PROTEIN_ gtcgtcggagaaacgtgtag and cgttgtctgaaccggaaccg _PROTEIN_ gtttggtgggaatgagagaacg and ctaaacgcctcactgttcttcc _PROTEIN_ catccagcatgtaatccctttgg and cacttgtggaaactgtacacaacc . prga _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ seedlings were grown on gm in the presence of white light for d. _PROTEIN_ prga _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ seeds were germinated on gm plates in the dark for d then exposed to light of for the time indicated . the hypocotyls were then harvested and frozen in liquid nitrogen . _PROTEIN_ prga _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ seeds were germinated on gm plates for d in light then transferred to fr for d . whole seedlings were frozen in liquid nitrogen . total proteins were extracted with buffer _PROTEIN_ with subsequent western blot analysis as previously described .
