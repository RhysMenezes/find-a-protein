_LOCATION_ ribosomes are among the largest multisubunit cellular complexes . arabidopsis thaliana ribosomes consist of different ribosomal proteins that each are encoded by two to six genes . it is unknown whether the paralogs are incorporated into the ribosome and whether the relative incorporation of paralogs varies in response to environmental cues . immunopurified ribosomes were isolated from a. thaliana rosette leaves fed with sucrose . trypsin digested samples were analyzed by _METHOD_ using both _METHOD_ and classical _METHOD_ . peptide features obtained by using these two methods were identified using mascot and proteinlynx global server searching the theoretical sequences of a. thaliana proteins . the a. thaliana genome encodes and of these were identified with proteotypic peptides for most of the identified proteins . these were identified with average protein sequence coverage of observed by _METHOD_ . interestingly the analysis shows that the abundance of paralogs in the ribosome changes in response to sucrose feeding . this is particularly evident for paralogous _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ proteins . these results show that protein synthesis in the a. thaliana _LOCATION_ involves a heterogeneous ribosomal population . the implications of these findings in the regulation of translation are discussed .
the aim of this study was to investigate whether quantitative changes could be detected in the composition of the ribosome population in relation to low or high sucrose growth conditions . rosette leaves of to transgenic a. thaliana citation plants were harvested from three independent batches of plants and incubated for h in liquid half times media with or without the addition of sucrose . high sucrose levels were shown to repress translation of the _PROTEIN_ and other group transcription _PROTEIN_ mrnas citation . previous research has shown that translation of the _PROTEIN_ transcription _PROTEIN_ mrna is regulated by sucrose . in the presence of high sucrose levels a ribosome stalling complex is formed in a process that requires synthesis of the conserved encoded sucrose control peptide citation . likely ribosome intrinsic or associated proteins are responsible for this evolutionarily conserved sucrose dependent stalling in a process that requires the sc peptide . possibly the ribosome composition changes in response to sucrose in a way that affects _PROTEIN_ mrna translation . affinity isolation of ribosomes was performed with the immunotagged _PROTEIN_ a. thaliana line as described in zanetti et al . citation . initial _METHOD_ analysis of trypsin digested ribosomes isolated from untreated rosette leaves confirmed that the extracts contain _PROTEIN_ . no major _LOCATION_ contamination was detected in the ribosomal preparations as determined by western blotting using the cfbpase antibody . very limited levels of proteins were immunoprecipitated from plants lacking the _PROTEIN_ transgene except for low levels of very high molecular weight proteins of unknown nature as shown by silver stained _PROTEIN_ . substantial levels of rrna and mrna were present in the ribosomal extracts as determined by confirming that the immunopurified ribosomal complexes includes ribosomes engaged in translation . sucrose treatment efficiently triggered the altered _PROTEIN_ of several previously studied marker genes . for _METHOD_ analysis immunopurified were precipitated with acetone digested with trypsin and peptides purified using spe for _METHOD_ analysis . peptide identification was based on _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ as well as dda _METHOD_ analysis the extracts _PROTEIN_ and six sucrose treated were analyzed in duplicate in _METHOD_ mode with alternating low and high collision energy as described in refs . citation citation . in addition to _METHOD_ mode some extracts were also analyzed in _METHOD_ mode to confirm peptide sequences identified by _METHOD_ and to complement _METHOD_ identifications with _METHOD_ information . supporting information fig . reports the workflow used during the different phases of the analysis . the peptide fragmentation information as acquired by the _METHOD_ spectrometer in _METHOD_ as well as _METHOD_ mode was matched to the arabidopsis genome database using the plgs software package . in total search hits were accumulated from the _METHOD_ runs and additional _METHOD_ runs . in this total number large redundancy is present due to the repeated detection of peptides in several samples the matching of single peptide sequences to multiple proteins and also the presence of derived peptides as a result of fragmentation during _METHOD_ . filtering of this redundancy was done at several levels removing redundancy at the peptide level resulted in a total number of sequences . from this were original sequences and were sequences derived from decay . filtering at a high stringency peptide score equal or higher than six resulted in total sequences of which from original and from decay . at the protein level these peptides were matched to predicted proteins located at gene loci . of the different gene loci are known components of the ribosome see supporting information table and . with on average nine original peptide sequences matched per protein this provides an average sequence coverage of . the high number of peptides matched per protein is a typical characteristic of the _METHOD_ mode of acquisition . in contrast to classical _METHOD_ where multiple charged peaks are selected for fragmentation _METHOD_ mode _METHOD_ a parallel fragmentation of all eluting peptides at the same time . as no precursor selection is performed more peptides can be identified . furthermore decay and neutral loss fragments of ionized peptides are also detected and matched to a protein sequence . the detection of decay fragments provides additional confidence for the identification of a particular peptide sequence citation citation . the list of identified proteins can be separated in a set of known ribosomal constituents and other proteins . a summary on identification numbers is presented in table . for of identified known ribosomal constituents at least two or more proteotypic peptide sequences were matched . these known ribosomal constituents represent and three _PROTEIN_ paralogs . the represent of all a. thaliana encoded . the protein coverage for the set of known was higher than the total average being with on average ten original peptide sequences matched per protein . in supporting information table also a histogram and scatterplot presenting the frequency distribution of the false discovery rate _PROTEIN_ and the relation to peptide and protein scores is presented . all have been detected with a protein _PROTEIN_ below . proteins with a higher _PROTEIN_ were either ribosome associated or background identified proteins . one hundred and were identified in our datasets . the protein coverage for the set of was lower than the total average being with on average seven original peptide sequences matched per protein . the majority of these proteins are _LOCATION_ encoded . some proteins like rubisco small subunit proteins are highly _PROTEIN_ and can therefore be suspected to be translated by the immunoprecipitated ribosomes . however at this stage a functional role of the in ribosomal biogenesis _LOCATION_ export or translation or the regulation thereof remains to be established . for quantitative analysis the _METHOD_ raw data were used as this acquisition mode provides a maximum coverage of the chromatographic peak shape of all eluting peptide ions in contrast to _METHOD_ mode . the _METHOD_ raw data were analyzed using progenesis _METHOD_ software . this analysis pipeline enables quantitation of all detected peaks independent of being identified or not . supporting information fig . reports the workflow used during the different phases of the analysis . progenesis _METHOD_ interactive peak matching and warping of _METHOD_ peak maps before the actual peak detection and quantitation . peak patterns were aligned starting with circa manual landmarks per _METHOD_ run followed by automatic vector detection . subsequently _METHOD_ patterns were stretched in retention time domain according to these match vectors and an aggregate peak map was constructed based on all aligned _METHOD_ patterns . then peak detection was performed on the aggregate image and peak intensity data were collected from each aligned run for all detectable peaks . in total peaks were detected with progenesis . for the majority of these peaks intensity data were available from all _METHOD_ runs . the identification from both _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ acquisition have been used to annotate the quantification features as far as they were identified by either of both methods . in order to link peak intensity information to protein identifications the database search results of _METHOD_ data from plgs were imported into progenesis . in addition _METHOD_ data from dda runs were loaded and aligned in progenesis . for these runs the _METHOD_ peak lists were generated in progenesis and database search was performed with mascot and reimported into progenesis . in summary from a total of features were identified by _METHOD_ and/or _METHOD_ . as some peptide sequences matched with more than one peak these peaks were combined and the intensity data were summed . this resulted in peptide sequences that were matched to one or more peaks in the quantitation table . for detected and quantified peaks no identification was matched . in order to correct for differences in ribosome extraction efficiency and _METHOD_ sample loading a normalization procedure was applied to both the identified as well as unidentified peaks . prior to normalization peaks that were identified as keratin or _PROTEIN_ peptide were removed . after summing of identical peak identification intensities an offset was added to limit the variation in the low intensity data range and peak intensities were normalized according to the mad normalization method _PROTEIN_ from progenesis . figure shows boxplot distributions of the peak intensities per sample prior to and after normalization . the normalization results in a more homogeneous distribution of peak intensities where the median of distributions is similar in all samples and the spread in low intensity peaks has been substantially reduced . to globally depict the intensity variance between the and control ribosomal preparations pca was performed using all matched peaks . in the pca plot as displayed in fig . of total variance was explained by the first two principal components . the and control samples are clearly separated _PROTEIN_ on the first component . furthermore the replicate runs of each sample and the replicate extracts from each treatment appear to cluster together indicating that the variance within the replicate extractions and replicate runs is much smaller than the variance between treatments and biological replicates . the pca plot indicates that the sucrose and samples are different . in order to optimally differentiate between sucrose and nonsucrose samples a multivariate _PROTEIN_ analysis was performed to maximally separate both classes citation . of replicates were included in this analysis . one of the samples was removed from the dataset in the final _PROTEIN_ analysis because of unexplained outlier behavior . this analysis reports a vip indicating per data point the strength of separating the two classes . the data points with a positive value for _PROTEIN_ are considered as significant contributions _PROTEIN_ and these are color marked in the loading plot of the pca in fig . . peaks with scores above are well separated on the first pca component . the analysis shows a significant change in ribosome composition in response to sucrose . however the majority of the quantified features are not significantly responsive to sucrose feeding . in addition to multivariate statistics a linear analysis of the normalized data was performed with the goal of detecting peptides undergoing significant changes in abundance between and leaves . this analysis was performed following the _PROTEIN_ . the resulting bh corrected from the limma analysis were transferred to excel . the significant correlation between the score and the log of the is displayed in supporting information fig . . focussing on the features that were identified we merged the quantitative data to peptide sequences . from these peptides only a subset was unique per paralog . we classified proteins as differentially present only if they were identified by two unique peptides intensity changing more than _PROTEIN_ and indicated significant both by and univariate statistics . these criteria are reasonably strict and possibly some differential were overlooked . of the identified in this study of which with peptide sequences paralogs changed significantly in response to sucrose . these results show that the ribosome composition changes in response to sucrose treatment . interestingly for several of the changing paralogs mutants have been reported that show distinct growth phenotypes citation citation . also the protein abundance of _PROTEIN_ citation citation a scaffold protein on the ribosomal subunit increases upon sucrose treatment . figure shows the resulting changes in families _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and the _PROTEIN_ family respectively . the fold changes of multiple proteotypic peptides per paralog are more or less similar . however there are some outliers for example _PROTEIN_ peptide dknaept . this long peptide actually had the lowest absolute peak intensity from the selected set resulting in a less accurate a peak quantitation compared to the other peptides . as can be seen in fig . only the levels of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and not their paralogs are changing in response to sucrose treatment using our stringent criteria . these data indicate that the incorporation abundance of specific paralogs into newly synthesized ribosomes is differentially regulated in response to sucrose . to understand the mechanism of regulation within the ribosome microarray of the mrna population was performed . interestingly most genes are upregulated by sucrose treatments on the transcriptional level except _PROTEIN_ but also for other paralogs and _PROTEIN_ paralogs an upregulation on mrna levels is observed . these results confirm previous publications in which regulation in response to sugar availability was reported citation citation . the microarray data _METHOD_ the pcr analysis shown in supporting information fig . . for the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ their increased protein abundance in the immunoprecipitated ribosomes can be explained by higher mrna levels . their paralogous genes are not upregulated at the mrna level to corresponding levels . for the other differential and _PROTEIN_ a similar phenomenon is not observed . this is especially true for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ for which an increased protein abundance is observed by _METHOD_ while the mrna levels of their paralogs increase more in response to sucrose feeding . for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ family members the regulation is identical for the paralogous genes at the mrna level while an increased protein abundance of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in the immunopurified ribosomal isolates is observed . the differential presence of in the ribosome can thus not simply be explained by differential mrna levels of the corresponding or _PROTEIN_ genes .
transgenic citation plants were grown on soil in long day conditions under cool white _METHOD_ light at relative humidity . rosette leaves of to plants were harvested from three independent batches of

h in _PROTEIN_ containing milk powder with a dilution of mouse monoclonal _PROTEIN_ antibody or dilution of polyclonal . blots were washed three times in _PROTEIN_ and were incubated in _PROTEIN_ that contained milk powder with a dilution of bovine antimouse igg hrp conjugate or dilution of goat antirabbit igg hrp conjugate for h. blots were further washed four times in _PROTEIN_ and the interaction was detected by adding volumes luminol solution luminol and and one volume enhancer solution _METHOD_ to the blot and exposed to kodak biomax _METHOD_ . affinity purified polysomes were precipitated by addition of eight volumes of cold acetone and incubated at for at least h. after centrifugation the pellet was washed with acetone and dried in air . the pellet was resuspended in rapigest sf surfactant mm dtt in m ammonium bicarbonate and incubated at for h. alkylation was performed by incubation with mm for min at room temperature . proteolytic digestion was initiated by adding of modified _PROTEIN_ trypsin . the sample was subsequently incubated overnight at after which the tryptic digestion was terminated by adding tfa to a final concentration of . after centrifugation at g for min the supernatant was cleaned by binding to a supelcleantm spe column _PROTEIN_ equilibrated with tfa . the peptides were eluted from this column with acn containing formic acid _METHOD_ dried during vacuum centrifugation and dissolved in fa prior to _METHOD_ analysis . for peptide separation a nanoacquity uplc system was used with a beh column and a min linear gradient from to acn at nl/min and the eluting peptides were injected on line into a synapt _METHOD_ instrument . _METHOD_ analyses were performed in positive mode using electrospray ionization with a nanolockspray source . as lock _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fibrinopeptide b was delivered from a syringe pump to the reference sprayer of the nanolockspray source at a flow rate of and the lock _METHOD_ channel was sampled every s. accurate _METHOD_ _METHOD_ data were collected with the instrument operating in either the _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ mode for acquisition or acquisition _PROTEIN_ . _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ analyses were used for all quantification while dda _METHOD_ was used on a few samples to separately confirm peptide identifications . for _METHOD_ data were acquired collecting spectra every s with alternating low and elevated energy over a m/z range . dda was performed by peptide fragmentation on the three most intense multiply charged ions that were detected in the _METHOD_ survey scan over a m/z range with an automatically adjusted collision energy based on the observed precursor m/z and charge state and using a dynamic exclusion window of s. _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ data were processed using proteinlynx global server software and per _METHOD_ run the resulting list of _METHOD_ containing all the fragment information was searched against the protein sequence database as part of the arabidopsis genome release . the annotation of genes in was updated manually based on published data citation citation citation citation citation http //www.arabidopsis.org arabidopsis transcriptome genomic _PROTEIN_ database http //signal.salk.edu/cgi bin/atta and recent sequence based data . for _METHOD_ the search was performed using the following parameters a minimum of five fragment ions per peptide and a minimum of nine fragment ions per protein a minimum of one peptide match per protein and a maximum of one missed trypsin cleavage . furthermore we used _PROTEIN_ as

proteotypic peptides . in the dda analyses single peptides were only kept if the ladder score was above . for _METHOD_ analyses proteins that were certified with one peptide were accepted at a above in addition to filtering at a false discovery rate of yielding a maximum false discovery rate of after filtering . for quantitative analyses the _METHOD_ data were processed in progenesis _METHOD_ which transformed the raw profile data with _METHOD_ into a custom mznld format and extracted peptide intensity features from _METHOD_ data . the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ of all acquired datasets were aligned against a chosen reference run _METHOD_ . retention time alignment by warping allowed the creation of a single aggregate peak map containing all peak data from all samples . after peak

internal progenesis approach . peptide identification results from proteinlynx database searches of _METHOD_ data were imported into progenesis for linking identified peptides to their corresponding peak features . the generated feature table with peak intensities and peptide annotations was exported and further processed in excel . for intensity normalization we first removed the features that

thereafter the median absolute deviation robustness selection and normalization approach from progenesis _METHOD_ was reproduced in excel see supporting information table . in short a normalization
