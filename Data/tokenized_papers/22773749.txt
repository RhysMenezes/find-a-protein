auxin transport which is mediated by specialized influx and efflux carriers plays a major role in many aspects of plant growth and development . _PROTEIN_ has been demonstrated to encode a high affinity auxin influx carrier . in arabidopsis thaliana _PROTEIN_ belongs to a small multigene family comprising four highly conserved genes _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . we report that all four members of this aux/lax family display auxin uptake functions . despite the conservation of their biochemical function _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ have been described to regulate distinct auxin dependent developmental processes . here we report that _PROTEIN_ regulates vascular patterning in cotyledons . we also describe how regulatory and coding sequences of aux/lax genes have undergone subfunctionalization based on their distinct patterns of spatial _PROTEIN_ and the inability of lax sequences to rescue _PROTEIN_ mutant phenotypes respectively . despite their high sequence similarity at the protein level transgenic studies reveal that lax proteins are not correctly targeted in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ domain . domain swapping studies suggest that the n terminal half of _PROTEIN_ is essential for correct lax localization . we conclude that arabidopsis aux/lax genes encode a family of auxin influx transporters that perform distinct developmental functions and have evolved distinct regulatory _METHOD_ .
to provide insight into the roles of aux/lax family members in plant growth and development their _PROTEIN_ was analyzed in detail using in situ immunolocalization and/or promoter _PROTEIN_ fusions and genomic yellow _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ /venus translational fusions . these studies revealed that the _PROTEIN_ patterns of aux/lax genes are mostly nonredundant and complementary in the primary root apex . previous studies have shown that _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ in the columella _PROTEIN_ root cap epidermis and stele tissues whereas _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ in the columella and stele . as part of this investigation using two different approaches _METHOD_ we report that _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ in the mature regions of primary root vascular tissues . weak _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was also detected in the vascular tissues in the primary root apex in _PROTEIN_ venus lines but was not detectable in the gus lines even after prolonged gus staining . this discrepancy is likely to be caused by the much larger genomic region used in _PROTEIN_ venus lines . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is detected in young vascular tissues the quiescent center and columella cells . _PROTEIN_ signal in the columella cells is most pronounced in the gus lines but is almost absent or very weak in the _PROTEIN_ venus lines . localization of _PROTEIN_ by in situ immunolocalization using anti _PROTEIN_ antibody also showed a relatively weak _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in the columella cells suggesting that the stronger signal of _PROTEIN_ in gus lines is likely to be caused by the more stable nature of the gus reporter . the divergence in spatial _PROTEIN_ patterns of aux/lax members is also clearly illustrated during _PROTEIN_ root development . as previously described _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ outside the emerging _PROTEIN_ root primordia whereas _PROTEIN_ is localized within the _PROTEIN_ root primordia during all stages of development . in comparison _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is first detected in stage i primordia and then _PROTEIN_ persists at the primordium base throughout _PROTEIN_ root formation . by contrast _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is only detected in the central region of _PROTEIN_ root primordia . as previously reported _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is auxin inducible . we then tested whether the _PROTEIN_ of other aux/lax genes can be regulated by auxin . a bioinformatic search for auxin related transcription _PROTEIN_ binding sites and the presence of canonical auxin response elements in a kb upstream sequence from _PROTEIN_ of the aux/lax promoters revealed that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ have the highest number of transcription _PROTEIN_ binding sites . to test this directly d old seedlings were treated for h with nm dichlorophenoxyacetic acid . under these conditions both _PROTEIN_ gus and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was strongly induced by auxin . our results also revealed that _PROTEIN_ transcript abundance was upregulated by auxin . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ stronger in the presence of auxin and is detected much closer to the root apex compared with untreated controls . however unlike _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is not induced in outer root tissues . in contrast with _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ neither _PROTEIN_ nor _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ seem to be altered in the presence of auxin . these results indicate that the regulation of aux/lax gene _PROTEIN_ has diverged during the course of evolution suggesting that they have acquired distinct roles in different developmental/physiological processes an evolutionary mechanism described as subfunctionalization . to probe whether the aux/lax family of proteins exhibit subfunctionalization a genetic approach was used to test the roles of these genes during arabidopsis growth and development . _PROTEIN_ has previously been reported to play an important role during the root gravitropic response as well as _PROTEIN_ root initiation whereas _PROTEIN_ has recently been shown to be involved in _PROTEIN_ root emergence . as part of this study _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants were analyzed for auxin regulated developmental phenotypes . no root growth related defects were obvious in either _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ mutants . unlike _PROTEIN_ mutations in _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ did not affect their root gravitropic responses or sensitivity to synthetic auxin d . similarly unlike _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ no _PROTEIN_ root related defects were observed for either _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ mutant alleles . to test the possibility of genetic redundancy between _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ growth responses to synthetic auxin d and _PROTEIN_ root development were investigated in double and triple mutants . the growth responses of double and triple mutant combinations to synthetic auxin d were similar to _PROTEIN_ suggesting that loss of _PROTEIN_ and/or _PROTEIN_ did not enhance the _PROTEIN_ phenotype . similarly the _PROTEIN_ root phenotypes of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutants or _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ triple mutants were not significantly different from single _PROTEIN_ mutants . under the same conditions the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ double mutant showed a severe reduction in emerged _PROTEIN_ roots in agreement with citation . these results suggest that during the course of evolution at least two members of the aux/lax family _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ have subfunctionalized whereas _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ gene products do not seem to influence root system architecture . however it can not be ruled out that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ perform more subtle patterning functions and specific conditions are required to uncover a root related mutant defect . alternatively these genes may have acquired novel functions or new roles in other plant organs . the latter view is supported by the discovery that mutating all four members of the aux/lax family affects _PROTEIN_ patterning and both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ have also been implicated in apical hook development processes that are known to be regulated by auxin . auxin is also known to regulate vascular development and many auxin transport and response mutants have defects in vascular development . _PROTEIN_ promoter gus studies show that gus _PROTEIN_ is associated with procambial and vascular tissues during embryogenesis . in developing leaves gus _PROTEIN_ is detected very early at the sites of initiating veins and starting from day _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ along the secondary loops starting with the first loop followed by the second third and fourth . by days to _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is also detected near the position of _PROTEIN_ veins . interestingly _PROTEIN_ is not _PROTEIN_ along the midvein . to assess the role of _PROTEIN_ during vascular development two different alleles of _PROTEIN_ were analyzed . the _PROTEIN_ allele represents an en element inserted into intron _PROTEIN_ whereas _PROTEIN_ has a t dna insertion in exon _PROTEIN_ . both these alleles seem to be null alleles because no _PROTEIN_ cdna is detected by rt pcr . examination of vascular development in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ cotyledons revealed that both alleles exhibit a significantly higher propensity of discontinuity in vascular strands with almost of _PROTEIN_ and of _PROTEIN_ seedlings showing vascular breaks in their cotyledons compared with only of control seedlings . in contrast with cotyledons no defect in vascular patterning was apparent in _PROTEIN_ leaves . this auxin related developmental phenotype for _PROTEIN_ provides indirect evidence for a role for _PROTEIN_ in facilitating auxin transport . to directly test whether every aux/lax protein has auxin transport activity experiments were performed in heterologous _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . using an oocyte _PROTEIN_ system both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were previously shown to be high affinity auxin transporters . similar experiments were performed for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . these experiments revealed that _PROTEIN_ exhibited auxin uptake activity in oocytes . competition experiments with cold d or iaa significantly reduced the uptake of radiolabeled iaa by oocytes injected with _PROTEIN_ complementary rna suggesting a carrier mediated uptake . by contrast there was only a small reduction in tritium labeled iaa uptake in the presence of the lipophilic auxin analog naphthalene acetic acid or indole butyric acid . surprisingly no auxin uptake activity was seen in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ oocytes . immunoblot experiments using specific anti _PROTEIN_ antibodies revealed that the protein was correctly _PROTEIN_ in these oocytes thus ruling out defects in its translation . to test whether _PROTEIN_ is correctly targeted to the pm in oocytes a _METHOD_ tagged version of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was _PROTEIN_ . immunodetection again showed that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was correctly _PROTEIN_ in these oocytes and was detected in the _LOCATION_ and not the _LOCATION_ fractions . however confocal analysis revealed no detectable _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ on the pm . in comparison _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was clearly seen on the pm of oocytes _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . these results show that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ unlike _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ is not properly targeted to the pm in xenopus laevis oocytes and may suggest a requirement for some plant specific accessory proteins/factors for its correct targeting that are lacking in x. laevis . as an alternative approach _PROTEIN_ transport activity was also assayed using a yeast based heterologous _PROTEIN_ system to determine the role of _PROTEIN_ in iaa uptake . in this system _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ yeast cells displayed a weak but consistent iaa uptake activity compared with control cells . to further probe whether _PROTEIN_ encodes an auxin influx transporter we also used a genetic assay . we reasoned that if _PROTEIN_ encodes a functional auxin transporter an _PROTEIN_ promoter driven _PROTEIN_ sequence would be expected to complement _PROTEIN_ mutants . the _PROTEIN_ mutant shows reduced sensitivity to auxins d and iaa and has a strong agravitropic root phenotype and a defect in _PROTEIN_ root initiation . to test the ability of _PROTEIN_ to complement the _PROTEIN_ mutant a _PROTEIN_ construct was created to _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ under the control of the kb _PROTEIN_ promoter and was then introduced into an _PROTEIN_ mutant allele _PROTEIN_ . homozygous seedlings were then tested for the restoration of the _PROTEIN_ mutant phenotype . as expected _PROTEIN_ lines _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ fully rescued the d resistant root growth and agravitropic phenotypes of _PROTEIN_ seedlings . by contrast _PROTEIN_ lines failed to rescue the root agravitropic phenotypes of _PROTEIN_ seedlings as well as d resistant root growth . to determine why _PROTEIN_ did not rescue the _PROTEIN_ phenotypes a quantitative rt pcr experiment was initially used to measure transgene _PROTEIN_ levels of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and n terminal ha epitope tagged _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ lines compared with wild type _PROTEIN_ levels . quantitative rt pcr revealed that _PROTEIN_ transgene was consistently _PROTEIN_ at equivalent levels to those of _PROTEIN_ and nha _PROTEIN_ . hence transgene _PROTEIN_ was not the basis for the lack of rescue of the _PROTEIN_ phenotypes . next we tested whether _PROTEIN_ was either incorrectly translated or trafficked in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ cells in these lines by in situ immunolocalization using anti _PROTEIN_ antibodies . because of the high similarity between all aux/lax family members the specificity of the antipeptide antibody was tested . in wild type seedling roots a strong signal was seen in vascular tissues the columella layer and the quiescent center but no signal was detected in equivalent tissues of _PROTEIN_ seedlings confirming the high specificity of this antibody for _PROTEIN_ . furthermore immunolocalization of _PROTEIN_ exhibited a broadly similar spatial _PROTEIN_ pattern to that obtained using gus and _PROTEIN_ venus lines suggesting the absence of posttranscriptional control of _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ cells . slight differences in _PROTEIN_ of gus particularly in the columella cells may be caused by differences in stability of gus and _PROTEIN_ proteins . we then tested the localization of _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ lines . as reported previously _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ in columella lrc epidermis and protophloem cells . in _PROTEIN_ lines as expected a strong _PROTEIN_ signal was seen in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ cells _PROTEIN_ however in cells that normally also _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ the transgene derived _PROTEIN_ signal was either weak or absent . surprisingly the _PROTEIN_ signal in columella and lrc cells accumulated inside the cell and was only occasionally found at the pm . altogether our data demonstrate that misexpressing _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ cells results in targeting defects for the protein in these tissues . this was further supported by an analysis of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ lines . in these lines _METHOD_ signal was clearly seen in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ cells including the epidermis but most of the signal is localized inside the cell . by contrast _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ to be correctly localized to the pm in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ cells . these results suggest that the subcellular distribution of _PROTEIN_ is distinct in different plant cells and tissues . to investigate whether other members of the family are also subject to such regulation we _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ under the control of the _PROTEIN_ promoter . the _PROTEIN_ promoter driven _PROTEIN_ lines also failed to rescue _PROTEIN_ mutant phenotypes . in situ immunolocalization revealed reduced _PROTEIN_ protein abundance and targeting defects that were similar in nature to those observed for _PROTEIN_ lines . we conclude that although _PROTEIN_ family members may share auxin transport characteristics these transport activities seem to be dependent on their unique cell or tissue type _PROTEIN_ patterns . to further investigate the inability of _PROTEIN_ to correctly localize in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ domain domain swap experiments were designed where either the n terminal half of _PROTEIN_ was fused to the c terminal half of _PROTEIN_ or the n terminal half of _PROTEIN_ was fused to the c terminal half of _PROTEIN_ to create chimeric genes driven by the _PROTEIN_ promoter . these constructs were then introduced into an _PROTEIN_ mutant allele _PROTEIN_ . homozygous seedlings were then tested for the rescue of the _PROTEIN_ mutant phenotype . the results revealed that like _PROTEIN_ lines also failed to rescue root agravitropic phenotypes of _PROTEIN_ seedlings as well as d resistant root growth . by contrast lines rescued both the d resistant root growth and agravitropic phenotypes of _PROTEIN_ seedlings . to probe the molecular basis of rescue in situ immunolocalization experiments were done using either anti ha antibody or anti _PROTEIN_ antibody . as shown in figures and lines show strong signal in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ domains in the lrc and epidermal cells besides endogenous _PROTEIN_ signal in the vascular tissues . by contrast lines show almost no signal in the lrc and the epidermal cell but a surprisingly strong signal is seen in the vascular tissues . on the basis of these results we conclude that the n terminal half of _PROTEIN_ is required for correct localization in the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ domain .
