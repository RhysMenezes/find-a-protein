the anaphase promoting complex/cyclosome an essential ubiquitin protein ligase regulates mitotic progression and exit by enhancing degradation of cell cycle regulatory proteins such as _PROTEIN_ whose transcripts are upregulated by duo _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ is required for cell division in male gametophytes and is a target of microrna _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis thaliana . whether apc/c is required for _PROTEIN_ dependent _PROTEIN_ regulation is unknown . mutants in both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ had pleiotrophic phenotypes resembling those of mutants affecting microrna biogenesis . we show that these apc/c mutants had reduced _PROTEIN_ levels and increased _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ transcript levels and that apc/c is required to recruit rna polymerase ii to _PROTEIN_ promoters . thus in addition to its role in degrading _PROTEIN_ apc/c stimulates production of _PROTEIN_ which downregulates _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ leading to reduced _PROTEIN_ transcription . both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ yellow _METHOD_ protein accumulated in unicellular microspores and bicellular pollen but _PROTEIN_ in tricellular pollen suggesting that spatial and temporal regulation of _PROTEIN_ by apc/c ensures mitotic progression . consistent with this the percentage of mature pollen with no or single sperm like cells increased in apc/c mutants and plants overexpressing _PROTEIN_ partially mimicked the _PROTEIN_ phenotype . thus apc/c is an integrator that regulates both microrna mediated transcriptional regulation of _PROTEIN_ and degradation of _PROTEIN_ .
_PROTEIN_ plays a critical role in mirna biogenesis in plants and seeds from _PROTEIN_ null alleles can not be obtained due to embryo lethality . however a weak allele of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ showed curly leaves abnormal reproductive development and reduced mirna levels but is fertile . we therefore performed a genetic screen after ethyl methanesulfonate mutagenesis of _PROTEIN_ aimed at the isolation of mutants with enhanced or suppressed phenotypes . we isolated a mutant with much more severe developmental phenotypes than those of _PROTEIN_ . the pleiotropic phenotypes included distorted leaf shapes abnormal shoot meristem development and a delay in the transition from the vegetative to the reproductive stage . moreover the mutant had severely abnormal flower and silique development including bushy inflorescences and shorter siliques . we showed that these phenotypes were _PROTEIN_ independent by backcrossing to wild type plants . therefore the mutant without _PROTEIN_ background was used for our subsequent analyses . collectively these pleiotropic developmental defects suggested that the mutated gene had roles at multiple stages of plant development . to further understand the basis of these heritable pleiotropic phenotypes we examined their inheritance in progeny from a cross of a mutant plant to a wild type landsberg _LOCATION_ plant . the genotype was determined for plants with obvious mutant phenotypes which comprised of the population . characterization of col/landsberg _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ throughout the genome showed that all plants with the mutant phenotype were homozygous for the col haplotype at one region on chromosome suggesting that a disrupted gene in this region was responsible for the mutant phenotype . this region was narrowed down to an interval between bac clones and . we sequenced the genes in this region and found a point mutation in the coding region of _PROTEIN_ . this mutation resulted in the conversion of a highly conserved asp to an asn at a position adjacent to the tpr domain . to confirm that this mutation was responsible for the phenotype a genomic fragment was fused to yellow _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ and introduced into the mutant . the morphological phenotypes were fully rescued in of plants . therefore we concluded that the phenotypes were due to the mutation in _PROTEIN_ and designated this allele _PROTEIN_ . to determine whether arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ is a functional ortholog of _PROTEIN_ found in other eukaryotes we tested whether arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ was able to functionally complement an _PROTEIN_ mutant in fission yeast . we introduced full length cdnas of both _PROTEIN_ and mutant _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ into a yeast _PROTEIN_ vector under the control of the gal promoter . these constructs were then transformed into the temperature sensitive mutant which has a lesion in the _PROTEIN_ gene in s. pombe . this mutant can grow at but not at . _PROTEIN_ of wild type _PROTEIN_ rescued the yeast mutant strain at the restrictive temperature whereas an empty vector or the mutant _PROTEIN_ did not . moreover a construct in which the asp was changed to glu _PROTEIN_ only partially complemented the yeast mutant at which reinforces the idea that the conserved asp is important for _PROTEIN_ function . microarray analyses indicated that apc/c genes were ubiquitously _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis tissues . to validate the _PROTEIN_ pattern of _PROTEIN_ we performed rt pcr analyses using cdna samples from different arabidopsis tissues . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was detected in a variety of vegetative and reproductive tissues . to substantiate the rt pcr analyses we constructed different promoter reporter constructs . the _PROTEIN_ reporter was _PROTEIN_ in almost all tissues examined including leaves shoot apical _METHOD_ inflorescences and siliques . during male gametophyte development the _METHOD_ reporter was detectable at the unicellular and bicellular stages but appeared less intense at the tricellular stage . we therefore examined the subcellular localization of a _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein during male gametophyte development . this protein fusion construct complemented the _PROTEIN_ phenotypes completely showing that _METHOD_ tagged _PROTEIN_ was functional . foci of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were visible in the _LOCATION_ and cytoplasm of unicellular microspores and bicellular pollen but only a very faint signal was detected in tricellular pollen and no signal was detectable in mature pollen . moreover the foci of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ varied in different microspores and pollen grains . microscopy analysis showed that the siliques in _PROTEIN_ had many apparently undeveloped ovules which led to obviously reduced seed set . the mutant was backcrossed to the wild type and the was allowed to self pollinate . only of the progeny had the mutant phenotypes instead of the expected . these results suggested that the mutant had transmission _METHOD_ . reciprocal crosses with wild type plants showed that transmission through the female was mildly affected but was strongly perturbed through the male . to rule out the possibility that disturbed male transmission was specific to _PROTEIN_ we analyzed the t dna insertion allele of another apc/c component _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ which was reported to have a bonsai phenotype similar to that of _PROTEIN_ . we found slightly reduced seed set in _PROTEIN_ and reciprocal crosses with wild type plants indicated that male transmission was more affected than female transmission . genetic analysis of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ because _PROTEIN_ apc/c function resulted in a reduced seed set phenotype we next tested whether increased apc/c function had an effect on seed set . we generated transgenic plants overexpressing _PROTEIN_ under the control of the histone three related promoter . is specifically _PROTEIN_ in the male germ line and accumulates in generative cell _LOCATION_ and subsequently in sperm cell _LOCATION_ . we obtained independent lines plants from five lines with single copy insertions were used for further analyses . the t dna cassette carrying _PROTEIN_ also contained a pollen specific marker _METHOD_ which we used to confirm homozygous plants . we measured the relative _PROTEIN_ levels of _PROTEIN_ rna in these plants by quantitative rt pcr and compared the _PROTEIN_ levels with those in wild type plants . we also scored the seed set . all progenies tested showed higher _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ levels . these plants also had on average reduced seed set indicating that the higher _PROTEIN_ levels in the male germline disrupted seed set . given the importance of cell cycle regulation by apc/c and the dynamic _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ during male gametophyte development we suspected that disrupting apc/c function might lead to disorganized cell divisions during male gametophyte development . indeed when mature pollen from _PROTEIN_ plants was stained with diamidino phenylindole the proportion of uninucleate cells was and binucleate cells was whereas in wild type plants these proportions were and respectively . introduction of wild type _PROTEIN_ into _PROTEIN_ completely rescued these defects of male gametophyte development confirming that _PROTEIN_ was responsible for these phenotypes . the defects in pollen maturation in _PROTEIN_ showed a similar trend but were less severe than those in _PROTEIN_ . a representative _PROTEIN_ transgenic plant showed increased incidence of bicellular pollen but no change in the incidence of unicellular pollen consistent with the specific _PROTEIN_ of in the male germline . if the vegetative cell and the generative cell fail to divide in apc/c mutants and in _PROTEIN_ overexpression lines the expectation might be that further dna replication would not occur . we therefore investigated dna content in the vegetative cell _LOCATION_ and the generative cell like _LOCATION_ in _PROTEIN_ and in the generative cell like _LOCATION_ in an _PROTEIN_ plant . relative to the _LOCATION_ dna content in the wild type _LOCATION_ dna content in both the vegetative cell _LOCATION_ and the generative cell like _LOCATION_ in _PROTEIN_ was significantly increased to nearly suggesting that in _PROTEIN_ pollen containing only a vegetative cell _LOCATION_ and pollen containing a single sperm cell both finish dna replication but can not enter the subsequent mitosis . as expected the _LOCATION_ dna content in the generative cell like _LOCATION_ in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ plants increased also to nearly . to examine whether pollen cell fate was disturbed we introduced _METHOD_ into _PROTEIN_ . this marker was observed in sperm cell _LOCATION_ of _PROTEIN_ mature pollen indicating that sperm cells in _PROTEIN_ had not lost their gametic fate . taken together our results indicate that apc/c plays an important role in mitotic cell cycle progression during male gametophyte development promoting tricellular pollen formation . because _PROTEIN_ was identified while looking for mirna accumulation mutants we hoped to determine the molecular mechanism by which _PROTEIN_ regulates male gametophyte development by examining whether _PROTEIN_ was compromised in mirna accumulation . of tested mirnas _PROTEIN_ accumulation was obviously reduced and this molecular phenotype was rescued by wild type _PROTEIN_ suggesting that _PROTEIN_ was involved in the _PROTEIN_ biogenesis pathway . we also found obvious reductions in accumulation of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ but no detectable changes for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and suggesting that the role of _PROTEIN_ in mirna biogenesis is locus specific . similar defects in mature _PROTEIN_ accumulation were observed in _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ is encoded by three genes _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . to investigate which step in _PROTEIN_ biogenesis was affected we used qpcr to examine whether primary mirna transcription of each _PROTEIN_ was affected in the pollen of apc/c mutants . we detected reduced pri _PROTEIN_ transcription from all three _PROTEIN_ genes in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ most notably an _PROTEIN_ for _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ . as expected overexpression of _PROTEIN_ resulted in increased pri _PROTEIN_ transcription . to further confirm these results and to determine the _PROTEIN_ patterns of each _PROTEIN_ during male gametophyte development we generated constructs in which the promoter regions of _PROTEIN_ b or c were fused to _METHOD_ . we introduced these constructs into wild type and apc/c mutants and examined multiple transgenic lines for each construct . in the wild type _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were strongly _PROTEIN_ at the unicellular microspore stage detectable at the bicellular stage but undetectable at the tricellular stage their _PROTEIN_ was restricted to vegetative cell _LOCATION_ . by contrast in _PROTEIN_ none of these reporter gene fusions was detectable at any stage of male gametophyte development . consistent with the much weaker phenotypes in _PROTEIN_ than in _PROTEIN_ described above we observed only a slight reduction of _PROTEIN_ of the three _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in _PROTEIN_ . since _METHOD_ signal intensity was not a quantitative measure of reporter gene _PROTEIN_ we performed qpcr to determine the levels of _METHOD_ mrna in inflorescences . indeed _METHOD_ mrna levels were lower in apc/c mutants than in the wild type . these results indicate that apc/c is required for _PROTEIN_ biogenesis during male gametophyte development and that it acts at the transcriptional level . although we showed that in the apc/c mutants the levels of pri _PROTEIN_ and the activities of the _PROTEIN_ promoters were compromised the defects in mir gene transcription in apc/c mutants could be an indirect effect of reduced _PROTEIN_ of certain known genes in the mirna biogenesis pathway . to evaluate this possibility we first examined the _PROTEIN_ of several mirna biogenesis pathway genes in _PROTEIN_ by qpcr . none of these genes was affected in _PROTEIN_ . furthermore the protein levels of these genes were comparable to those in the wild type . therefore the reduced pri mirna and mature mirna levels in the apc/c mutants are unlikely due to reduced _PROTEIN_ of mirna biogenesis genes . this result prompted us to examine whether apc/c plays a direct role in the transcription of mir genes . pol ii is responsible for mir transcription in animals and plants . therefore we next examined pol ii occupancy at promoters of several mir genes by chromatin immunoprecipitation _PROTEIN_ using an antibody against the largest subunit of pol ii _PROTEIN_ . we monitored _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ using as a positive control . pol ii occupancy was enriched at regions encompassing the transcription start sites at these loci _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ over the no antibody _PROTEIN_ that served as a negative control . pol ii occupancy at these loci was significantly reduced in _PROTEIN_ . these results indicate that apc/c promotes pol ii recruitment to mir genes . because _PROTEIN_ biogenesis was perturbed in these apc/c mutants we next asked whether this perturbation had biological significance . since _PROTEIN_ an _PROTEIN_ target was reported to play a role in twin sperm cell formation we first used qpcr to examine whether _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was affected in the pollen of apc/c mutants . the mrna level of _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ was increased fold consistent with the notion that _PROTEIN_ is negatively regulated by _PROTEIN_ . by contrast _PROTEIN_ which has a function similar to that of _PROTEIN_ but is not a _PROTEIN_ target had similar _PROTEIN_ levels in _PROTEIN_ and wild type pollen . a similar trend was observed for _PROTEIN_ . as expected _PROTEIN_ levels were reduced in _PROTEIN_ pollen . to substantiate the above result we compared the _PROTEIN_ level of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ at different stages during pollen development in wild type or _PROTEIN_ plants containing the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ construct . we consistently observed a slightly increased intensity of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signals through early bicellular stage to mature pollen in _PROTEIN_ . therefore our results demonstrate that apc/c plays a role in _PROTEIN_ biogenesis that is important for _PROTEIN_ dependent _PROTEIN_ repression . as increased _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was observed in apc/c mutants and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was reported to be promoted by _PROTEIN_ we speculated that apc/c might affect not only the stability of _PROTEIN_ but also _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ . to test this hypothesis we compared _PROTEIN_ mrna levels in wild type and _PROTEIN_ pollen by qpcr . there was significantly more _PROTEIN_ mrna in _PROTEIN_ than in the wild type . similarly increased _PROTEIN_ mrna was also observed in _PROTEIN_ . taken together these results indicate that apc/c can regulate _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . to determine if _PROTEIN_ accumulates during male gametogenesis in these apc/c mutants we introduced _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ into wild type _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ plants . in the wild type _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was detected only in the _LOCATION_ of unicellular microspores and in the vegetative _LOCATION_ of bicellular pollen but not in tricellular or mature pollen consistent with microarray results . by contrast _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ accumulated in _LOCATION_ of both the vegetative cell and sperm cells of tricellular and mature pollen from _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ accumulation in vegetative _LOCATION_ and expanded _PROTEIN_ in sperm cell _LOCATION_ at the tricellular stage in these apc/c mutants suggest that apc/c is necessary for removal of _PROTEIN_ during male gametophyte development . to further support the observation of accumulated _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in _PROTEIN_ we used immunoblots to examine the total protein levels of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in inflorescences from multiple individual wild type and _PROTEIN_ transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was greatly increased in _PROTEIN_ further indicating that disruption of _PROTEIN_ function caused the failure of _PROTEIN_ degradation . taken together our data demonstrate that apc/c in addition to its known role in regulating _PROTEIN_ degradation can regulate _PROTEIN_ at the mrna level .
