_LOCATION_ are oval or tubular lipid rich structures present in all _LOCATION_ types but their specific functions are unclear . pgs contain quinones tocopherol and lipids and in chromoplasts carotenoids as well . it is not known whether pgs contain any enzymes or regulatory proteins . here we determined the proteome of pgs from chloroplasts of stressed and unstressed leaves of arabidopsis as well as from pepper fruit chromoplasts using _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . together this showed that the proteome of chloroplast pgs consists of seven fibrillins providing a protein coat and preventing coalescence of the pgs and an additional proteins likely involved in metabolism of isoprenoid derived molecules lipids and carotenoid cleavage . four unknown _PROTEIN_ kinases were identified possibly involved in regulation of quinone monooxygenases . most proteins have not been observed earlier but have predicted n terminal chloroplast transit peptides and lack transmembrane domains consistent with localization in the pg lipid monolayer particles . quantitative differences in pg composition in response to high light stress and degreening were determined by differential stable isotope labeling using formaldehyde . more than proteins were identified in the pg proteome of pepper chromoplasts including four enzymes of carotenoid biosynthesis and several homologs of proteins observed in the chloroplast pgs . our data strongly suggest that pgs in chloroplasts form a functional metabolic link between the inner envelope and _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and play a role in breakdown of carotenoids and oxidative stress defense whereas pgs in chromoplasts are also an active site for carotenoid conversions .
we improved existing pg purification protocols found in the literature with the objective of shortening purification time and improving pg yield . this resulted in highly purified pgs that were light yellow in color . using this improved protocol pgs were purified from wild type and _PROTEIN_ plants with reduced _PROTEIN_ of the chloroplast _PROTEIN_ protease grown under optimal conditions . in addition pgs were prepared from wild type plants first grown under optimal conditions and then kept for d in complete darkness or exposed to d of high light _PROTEIN_ flux . the protein amount of pgs after _PROTEIN_ and dark treatment increased respectively to and fold on a total leaf fresh weight basis . to obtain an overview of the pg proteomes pg proteins were separated by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ stained and the major protein bands were analyzed by _PROTEIN_ assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ peptide _METHOD_ fingerprinting . the chloroplast pg proteomes were dominated by fibrillins in bands and _PROTEIN_ and fru bis p aldolases _PROTEIN_ in band . _METHOD_ composition and comparative accumulation of the chloroplast pg proteome of stressed _PROTEIN_ and unstressed leaves and _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis c control d darkness _PROTEIN_ env chloroplast envelope thy _LOCATION_ chl chloroplast str stroma . to more fully identify the pg proteomes we used a protocol compatible with the hydrophobic nature of pgs . in short proteomes were delipidized by _PROTEIN_ solubilization and acetone precipitation followed by resolubilization of the proteins in dimethyl sulfoxide trypsin digestion and nano liquid chromatography electrospray ionization tandem _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ analysis of the peptides . thirty two proteins not part of the _LOCATION_ photosynthetic complexes were identified in the chloroplast pgs from unstressed and stressed conditions and _PROTEIN_ . pgs purified from the chloroplast protease mutant _PROTEIN_ were very similar in composition to those from dark treated wild type plants . composition and comparative accumulation of the chloroplast pg proteome of stressed _PROTEIN_ and unstressed leaves and _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis the photosynthetic apparatus see table i legend for definitions of abbreviations . these identified proteins were cross correlated to large scale arabidopsis proteomics data from envelope and other arabidopsis subcellular proteomes and to other literature . most of the proteins were never identified in the stromal or envelope proteome clearly indicating that pgs contain a specific protein population . a number of proteins were identified during our previous in depth analyses of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ which is not surprising because pgs are associated with the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . only one of the pg proteins has predicted transmembrane domains . the absence of transmembrane domains is consistent with the absence of a lipid bilayer in the pgs . the documented lipid monolayer can not accommodate transmembrane domains . this is another strong indication that the proteome identified here is not a random collection of hydrophilic _LOCATION_ or envelope proteins . the pg proteins were tentatively assigned to four functional classes namely fibrillins forming the protein coat of the pgs lipid metabolism or mobilization of fatty acids quinone synthesis and regulation and no obvious function . in addition we identified three proteins involved in synthesis of the hormone jasmonic acid tocopherol and a protein likely involved carotenoid cleavage . finally we identified two _PROTEIN_ with very high scores it is highly unlikely that they represent stromal contamination because we hardly observed other abundant stromal proteins . we will comment on the unique localization and functional assignments of most of the identified proteins _PROTEIN_ in this article . we also identified a number of proteins of the _LOCATION_ photosynthetic apparatus in particular after d of continued _PROTEIN_ stress and to a lesser extent also after d of continued darkness . only some of the very abundant light harvesting proteins were found in the control and _PROTEIN_ pg preparations with relatively low scores . it is most likely that they represent dismantled _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ fragments . we were interested in determining whether and how the pg proteome changes after prolonged light stress _PROTEIN_ or after degreening during prolonged darkness . under these conditions significant breakdown of the _LOCATION_ proteome and possibly the lipid bilayer occurs . to determine differential protein accumulation due to these dark and _PROTEIN_ stress treatments peptides for each of the pg samples were labeled with either formaldehyde or its deuterated form _PROTEIN_ . the principles of this comparative proteomics technique were initially described by citation . we optimized the technique for peptide recovery and labeling efficiency and also _PROTEIN_ it for _LOCATION_ proteins . three pairwise comparisons between the three pg samples were carried out and included a label switch within each pair as outlined in figure . the experiment was carried out with two independent biological replicates and the data are summarized in tables i and ii and discussed further below . detailed data can be found in supplemental table ii . we also purified and analyzed pgs from chromoplasts of red pepper fruits using similar procedures as for the chloroplasts . d electrophoresis gel analysis showed that the chromoplast pg proteome was dominated by several fibrillins _PROTEIN_ and others . the proteomes of pg pepper chromoplasts were also analyzed by in solution digestion and nanolc esi _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ data searched against the national center for biotechnology information database and the solanaceae database . twenty eight proteins were identified in the pgs of pepper chromoplasts . to allow better cross correlation to the chloroplast pg data protein accessions identified in the pepper pg were blast searched against the predicted arabidopsis proteome . the two pg types have proteins in common as indicated in bold in tables i and iii . composition of the pg proteome of red pepper chromoplasts can not distinguish between and . to compare the pg proteomes with prolamellar bodies and possibly pgs in etioplasts we grew rice seedlings in complete darkness and purified the etioplasts . we then used the pg purification procedure to collect low density lipid particles and _LOCATION_ from these etioplasts . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ analysis of the low density fractions showed that they were dominated by protochlorophyllide reductase a/b as expected in prolamellar bodies and a mixture of proteins unrelated to pgs in band . further analysis by in solution digestion and nanolc esi _METHOD_ again identified protochlorophyllide reductase a/b with very high mowse scores and also identified one fibrillin _PROTEIN_ and an aldolase . this fibrillin was identified so far only in _LOCATION_ . no further overlap was observed with the pg proteomes from either chloroplasts or chromoplasts . these low density _LOCATION_ thus mostly represented prolamellar bodies with some associated or contaminating proteins and not much plastoglubular protein .
