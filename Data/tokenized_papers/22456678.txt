_PROTEIN_ has a small domain that has sequence similarities to integrins from animals . integrins serve as a transmembrane linker between the _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ and the _LOCATION_ which play critical roles in a variety of biological processes . because the function of _PROTEIN_ is unknown arabidopsis thaliana _PROTEIN_ which is a transmembrane receptor for cell adhesion molecules and a middle member of the cell wall _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ continuum in plants has been described . _PROTEIN_ co _PROTEIN_ with green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ was found to localize _PROTEIN_ to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . the mutant arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ cells exhibit various phenotypes with cell shape cell cluster size _PROTEIN_ and cellulose content of cell wall the adhesion between cells and the adhesion of _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ to cell wall varied by plasmolysis . using direct staining of filamentous actin and indirect _METHOD_ staining of microtubules cortical actin filaments and microtubules arrays were significantly altered in cells either where _PROTEIN_ was absent or over _PROTEIN_ . it is concluded that _PROTEIN_ may be a substantial middle member of the cell wall _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ continuum and play an important role in the continuum by regulating cell wall and cortical _LOCATION_ organization .
to investigate the biological activity of _PROTEIN_ transformants the _PROTEIN_ and localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein was first studied using immunoblotting analysis and _METHOD_ microscopy in arabidopsis cells . the total proteins from arabidopsis calli were incubated with an antibody against _METHOD_ . as shown in a specific protein band with a molecular _METHOD_ of around kda was detected in _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ over _PROTEIN_ transformants by immunoblot analysis but not in the wild type and the _PROTEIN_ mutant . to ascertain the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ the localization of _METHOD_ in transforming arabidopsis suspended cells was also studied . the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was detected _PROTEIN_ in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ over _PROTEIN_ suspended cells . as a control suspended cell lines of the wild type only over _PROTEIN_ a _METHOD_ reporter gene were also established and the _METHOD_ was detected not only in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ but all over the cytoplasm . as an additional control suspended cell lines of the mutant _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ an _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein were also established . the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was also detected in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ while the _METHOD_ was detected all over the cytoplasm in mutant cells only _PROTEIN_ a _METHOD_ protein derived by the promoter . no _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was detected in columbia and the mutant _PROTEIN_ . these results clearly indicated that _PROTEIN_ protein is a _LOCATION_ protein . cellular localization of _PROTEIN_ proteins . immunoblot analysis of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein in calli of arabidopsis . proteins isolated and purified from wild type mutant _PROTEIN_ and over _PROTEIN_ calli _PROTEIN_ were separated on _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and probed with an antibody against _METHOD_ . the molecular weight of protein specifically reacted with _METHOD_ antibody is about kda . the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was detected using an olympus _METHOD_ microscope . left _METHOD_ field and right bright field of the corresponding cells . to study the functions of _PROTEIN_ protein further the cell shape of different genotypes i.e . the wild type columbia the _PROTEIN_ mutant and _PROTEIN_ over _PROTEIN_ transformants was compared first using suspension cultured cell lines . more than of cells in the wild type are acerose or oval and the cells stick to each other and form stringlike cell chains . the cells of the _PROTEIN_ mutant exhibit a characteristic round or oval shape and almost no cell clusters are formed while most of the _PROTEIN_ over _PROTEIN_ cells show an oval shape and the cells form large cell clusters usually containing over cells per cell cluster .these results suggest that the _PROTEIN_ protein regulates cell shape and cell to cell adhesion . phenotypes of the suspended cells of the three genotypes . the cells in a suspension culture under the microscope columbia _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . quantitative analysis of the different shapes of the suspended cells of the three genotypes . quantitative analysis of the cell clusters size of the cell lines of the three genotypes . _PROTEIN_ of the cell wall of suspended cells of the three genotypes of arabidopsis . mean _PROTEIN_ are given from three separate experiments . cellulose contents of the cells of the three genotypes . data are means of three separate experiments . different letters represent significant differences between different genotypes at the level . showed the differences in cell wall _PROTEIN_ among three different genotypes . compared with the wild type _PROTEIN_ mutant cells had the thinnest cell wall while _PROTEIN_ over _PROTEIN_ cells had a _PROTEIN_ cell wall than the _PROTEIN_ mutant cells but a thinner cell wall than the wild type . compositional analysis of cell walls isolated from arabidopsis calli of three different genotypes revealed substantial differences in cellulose content among them . as in the case of cell wall _PROTEIN_ the wild type cell wall had a higher cellulose content than the _PROTEIN_ mutant cell wall . surprisingly the cell wall of _PROTEIN_ over _PROTEIN_ transformants had the highest cellulose content which was significantly higher than wild type cell walls . understandably cell wall biosynthesis and the deposition of cell wall substances were very complicated and well regulated and the roles of _PROTEIN_ may not cover all the aspects of cell wall biosynthesis and secretion of cell wall substances . the sequence and structural similarity of _PROTEIN_ to the integrins of animals led us to examine a physiological role for _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ cell integrity through _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ cell wall adhesions . the suspended cells of the three genotypes were visualized before and after osmotic stress induced plasmolysis to assess the integrity of _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ cell wall adhesion . when suspended cells were incubated in the same hyperosmotic solution _PROTEIN_ for h the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ separated from the cell wall but the extent of plasmolysis was dependent on the different genotypes of arabidopsis . as shown in an obvious attachment of _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ to the cell wall was visible in wild type cells and the plasmolysis index was . in mutant cells more severe plasmolyses were observed . the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ detached from the cell wall at most regions and the plasmolysis index nearly reached . over _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ had no obvious effect on the hyperosmotic stress induced plasmolysis compared with the wild type cells . _PROTEIN_ altered the plasmolysis and the adhesion of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ to the cell wall . plasmolysis induced by hyperosmotic stress in suspended cells of the three different genotypes columbia the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ cells were incubated in a control medium s g cells were incubated in a hyperosmotic sorbitol and _PROTEIN_ solution with mmol of osmolality for h. scale bar . plasmolysis index analysis of suspended cells of the three different genotypes of arabidopsis treated with osmotic stress . the degree of plasmolysis was observed under a light microscope . more than cells were observed in each view and the plasmolysis index was calculated as described in the materials and methods . data are means of three separate experiments . different letters represent significant differences between different genotypes at the level . our results clearly indicated that _PROTEIN_ protein controlled cell shape and the adhesion of _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ to the cell wall as well as cell wall biosynthesis . it is well known that cell shape is established under the control of the _LOCATION_ that is composed of microfilaments intermediate filaments and microtubules . therefore it is reasonable to assume that if _PROTEIN_ protein is indeed involved in the regulation of cell shape there may be interactions between the _PROTEIN_ protein and the _LOCATION_ . here the differences in the arrangement of the microfilaments and microtubules are compared among the three different genotypes used in the present study . showed the microfilament arrangement of the three genotypes observed by direct staining with alexa phalloidin . the microfilaments in the wild type cells lay in ordered arrays most of them transverse to the long axis of the cells . a similar microfilament arrangement but a much denser one was observed in the cells of _PROTEIN_ over _PROTEIN_ transformants . a significant difference in microfilament arrangement was observed in the _PROTEIN_ null mutant cells in which the microfilament arrangement was much more random sparser and _PROTEIN_ . _METHOD_ images of microfilaments of the suspended cells of the three genotypes columbia the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ the cell labelled with the alexa phalloidin showing the actin the same cell as on the right but as bright field images . the cortical microtubules were visualized by indirect _METHOD_ staining with anti tubulin antibodies . the cortical microtubules were arranged into a fine structure with a predominant orientation parallel to the short axis of the cells in the wild type cells and in the cells of the _PROTEIN_ over _PROTEIN_ transformants whereas more random and sparse arrangement of microtubules was observed in the _PROTEIN_ mutant cells . _METHOD_ images of microtubules of the suspended cells of the three genotypes columbia the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ the cell labelled with the _PROTEIN_ conjugated antibody showing the tubulin the same cell as on the right but as bright field images .
