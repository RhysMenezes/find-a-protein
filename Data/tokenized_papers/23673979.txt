_PROTEIN_ is a member of the arabidopsis thaliana /calmodulin dependent kinase related kinase family . here we show that inactivation of _PROTEIN_ inhibits primary root elongation and delays gravitropic bending of shoots and roots . reduced activity of the auxin induced green _METHOD_ protein reporter suggests that auxin is depleted from _PROTEIN_ root tips . however no tip collapse is observed and the transcription of genes for auxin biosynthesis auxin transporter/auxin transporter like protein auxin influx and _PROTEIN_ formed _PROTEIN_ efflux carriers is unaffected by the _PROTEIN_ mutation . whereas _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ display normal localization _PROTEIN_ is depleted from apical _LOCATION_ of epidermal cells and shows basal to apical relocalization in the cortex of the _PROTEIN_ root transition zone . this together with an increase in the number of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ root primordia suggests facilitated auxin efflux through the cortex toward the elongation zone . _PROTEIN_ is a _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ associated kinase that _METHOD_ u shaped patterns facing outer _PROTEIN_ walls of epidermis and cortex cells . brefeldin inhibition of exocytosis stimulates _PROTEIN_ internalization into brefeldin bodies . _PROTEIN_ phosphorylates the hydrophilic loop of _PROTEIN_ in vitro and _PROTEIN_ shows accelerated accumulation in brefeldin bodies in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . delayed gravitropic response of the _PROTEIN_ mutant thus likely reflects defective phosphorylation of _PROTEIN_ and deceleration of its brefeldin sensitive _LOCATION_ recycling .
_PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was originally identified in yeast two hybrid and in vitro protein binding assays as a potential interaction partner of the c terminal repeat domain of _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ protein a subunit of the spliceosome activating complex . although subsequent studies did not confirm in vivo formation of a _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ complex under normal growth conditions we found that inactivation of the _PROTEIN_ gene by a t dna insertion in the _PROTEIN_ mutant line _PROTEIN_ resulted in reduced primary root elongation analogously to the _PROTEIN_ mutation . by contrast a second t dna insertion in the _PROTEIN_ gene _PROTEIN_ obtained from the signal collection failed to confer a root elongation detect . characterization of the mutant alleles indicated that in _PROTEIN_ a t dna insertion was located bp downstream of the _PROTEIN_ codon in the first exon whereas in _PROTEIN_ a single t dna insert was identified bp upstream of the _PROTEIN_ codon . quantitative rt pcr analysis of homozygous t dna tagged lines detected no transcript from the _PROTEIN_ allele indicating that it is a null mutation . on the other hand insertion of the t dna into the untranslated leader region fused the coding region of the _PROTEIN_ gene with an upstream t dna left border carrying a cauliflower mosaic virus promoter . consequently the full length _PROTEIN_ coding region was transcribed by the promoter in the _PROTEIN_ line correlating with its wild type phenotype . to verify that the root elongation defect reducing the root length by in the _PROTEIN_ mutant compared with the wild type was indeed caused by inactivation of _PROTEIN_ we constructed modified versions of _PROTEIN_ by replacing its stop codon with coding regions of green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ reporters . introduction of the _METHOD_ construct into the _PROTEIN_ mutant restored root elongation to the wild type indicating genetic complementation of the mutation . to analyze tissue and organ specific _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ during plant development the gus construct was transformed into wild type and _PROTEIN_ mutant plants . whereas qrt pcr comparison of relative transcript levels indicated that _PROTEIN_ was active in most plant organs showing the highest transcript levels in flower buds and young flowers characterization of gus _PROTEIN_ by histochemical gus staining revealed that _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ in the root and shoot _METHOD_ root pericycle hypocotyl and leaf vasculature stem vascular bundles _PROTEIN_ sepals anther filaments and pistils of flowers and siliques . further analysis of altered developmental traits indicated that _PROTEIN_ seedlings produced to more _PROTEIN_ roots compared with the wild type . enhancement of _PROTEIN_ root formation in _PROTEIN_ suggested a possible alteration of auxin distribution leading to increased auxin transport toward the elongation zone . as this potential disturbance of normal auxin transport would be expected to affect the regulation of gravitropic root bending we compared gravitropic responses of the wild type and _PROTEIN_ . seedlings were subjected to rotation after growing vertically for week . after h of gravistimulation of the wild type but only of _PROTEIN_ roots showed a bending of . after h of wild type roots were already curved by but of _PROTEIN_ roots showed only bending . these data revealed that the _PROTEIN_ mutation caused a marked delay in the root gravitropic response . lugol staining of starch containing columella cells of wild type and _PROTEIN_ mutant roots revealed an identical pattern indicating that the _PROTEIN_ mutation did not cause alteration in the accumulation of starch statoliths . surprisingly we found that following a rotation to a horizontal position in the darkness inflorescence _METHOD_ of _PROTEIN_ showed a maximum of upward bending within h while wild type _METHOD_ were oriented vertically by bending . this indicated that the _PROTEIN_ mutation also caused a delay in the shoot gravitropic response . as expected the _METHOD_ complementing construct restored impaired root and shoot gravitropic responses of the _PROTEIN_ mutant to the wild type . _PROTEIN_ is one of the eight members of the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ family which share very similar structural and biochemical features with _PROTEIN_ characterized in other plant species . n terminal sequences of _PROTEIN_ show high variability except for two conserved domains corresponding to an mgxc myristoylation and palmitoylation motif and a downstream putative _LOCATION_ localization signal which are also present in _PROTEIN_ . ala replacements of gly and cys positions of the mgxc motive were demonstrated to abolish _LOCATION_ association leading to mixed cytoplasmic and _LOCATION_ localization of tomato _PROTEIN_ . within their central ser/thr kinase domains including the _PROTEIN_ binding active site and activation t loop sequences _PROTEIN_ show over sequence identity . all _PROTEIN_ undergo autoactivation by self phosphorylation in vitro . arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ autophosphorylate their t loop ser and ser residues which correspond to the ser position in _PROTEIN_ . all so far known _PROTEIN_ including _PROTEIN_ share a conserved c terminal calmodulin binding domain which overlaps with the kinase autoinhibitory domain . selective cam binding in the presence of simulates autophosphorylation but leads only to marginal increase of substrate phosphorylation by _PROTEIN_ which are equally active without cam in the presence of either or the chelator egta . we examined several properties of _PROTEIN_ finding that they were highly similar to those of other biochemically characterized members of the _PROTEIN_ family . recombinant _PROTEIN_ purified via an n terminal tag underwent autophosphorylation and phosphorylated the myelin basic protein substrate similarly in the presence of both and egta . similarly to tomato _PROTEIN_ upon transient _PROTEIN_ of the _METHOD_ construct in arabidopsis protoplasts _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was localized to the pm . following stable _PROTEIN_ in an arabidopsis root cell culture _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was exclusively detected in the pm containing purified microsomal fraction but not in the _LOCATION_ and cell wall fractions by immunoblotting with anti _METHOD_ antibody . furthermore in root epidermal cells of stably transformed wild type plants _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ showed colocalization with the pm specific dye indicating that _PROTEIN_ is a pm associated protein kinase . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ displayed particularly strong _PROTEIN_ in the root tips . confocal laser microscopy imaging highlighted _PROTEIN_ localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in u shape patterns which were oriented toward the _PROTEIN_ walls of epidermal cortex and _PROTEIN_ root cap cells and basal _LOCATION_ of columella tiers . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ also decorated the pericycle in the _PROTEIN_ root initiation zone and showed epidermis facing _PROTEIN_ localization in dividing cells of early stage root primordia . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was also detectable in the _PROTEIN_ root vasculature and reproduced the same pattern in elongating root primordia as seen in different cell types of the _PROTEIN_ root apex . _LOCATION_ localization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ confirmed by counter staining with was gradually reduced in epidermal cells of roots during treatment with bfa . following transient accumulation of bfa bodies _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ showed differential localization compared with as the _METHOD_ signal became detectable also in the area of cell _LOCATION_ . brefeldin sensitive internalization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ thus suggested that _PROTEIN_ localization of _PROTEIN_ is likely mediated by the bfa sensitive _LOCATION_ recycling pathway . to visualize redistribution of auxin during gravistimulation of roots we introgressed the auxin inducible _METHOD_ reporter into the _PROTEIN_ mutant . in vertically grown roots _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ levels were significantly lower in the columella tiers and root cap of the _PROTEIN_ mutant compared with the wild type suggesting reduced auxin accumulation in the root apex . control qrt pcr measurements indicated that the _PROTEIN_ mutation did not alter the transcription of a selected set of key genes acting in the regulation of auxin biosynthesis including the trp aminotransferase _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . furthermore the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ genes which show auxin induced transcription in the root as well as both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ genes displayed comparable transcription in the roots of the wild type _PROTEIN_ mutant and complemented _PROTEIN_ line carrying the _METHOD_ construct . these data indicated that the _PROTEIN_ mutation did not result in global change of auxin regulated gene _PROTEIN_ although it led to markedly reduced _PROTEIN_ of auxin induced _METHOD_ reporter in the root apex . however in contrast with _PROTEIN_ overexpression which induces downregulation of _METHOD_ by facilitating strong shootward auxin efflux from the root apex the _PROTEIN_ mutation did not result in a collapse of root tips . upon gravistimulation by rotation asymmetric activation of _METHOD_ in the lower proximal _PROTEIN_ root cap and epidermal cells of the wild type was observed within to h and reached a maximum in h followed by a return to the symmetric vertical pattern by h . in the _PROTEIN_ mutant induction of auxin flow from the upper section of gravistimulated roots toward the root apex restored the wild type level of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in the columella tiers to h after rotating the roots . a maximum of asymmetrically localized _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in the lower _PROTEIN_ root cap and epidermis was observed only at h after application of gravistimulus indicating an h delay in the root gravitropic response in _PROTEIN_ . pretreatment of wild type roots with naphthylphtalamic acid an inhibitor of auxin efflux for h before h gravistimulation resulted in a typical upwards shift of _METHOD_ localization extending from the upper tiers of columella into the quiescent center cortex and endodermal files as described by citation . npa treatment further reduced weak _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ in the root apex of _PROTEIN_ mutant but did not prevent asymmetric activation of _METHOD_ in the lower epidermis of upper root hair zone . by contrast h of application of auxin influx inhibitor naphtoxyacetic acid completely prevented gravitropic response and resulted in similarly high levels of _METHOD_ reporter _PROTEIN_ in the columella cap vascular phloem cells and hair zones of both wild type and _PROTEIN_ mutant roots . restoration of normal _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in the _PROTEIN_ root apex by noa mediated inhibition of _PROTEIN_ thus supported the notion that delayed gravitropic bending and enhanced differentiation of _PROTEIN_ roots in the _PROTEIN_ mutant could result from enhanced shootward auxin flow from the root apex . to determine how asymmetric redistribution of auxin during gravistimulation affects _PROTEIN_ pm localization of _PROTEIN_ similar root gravitropism assays were performed with wild type plants _PROTEIN_ the _METHOD_ construct . _PROTEIN_ localization patterns of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ remained unaltered indicating that alterations in the auxin flow during gravistimulation of roots did not affect _PROTEIN_ pm localization of _PROTEIN_ in the columella root cap epidermis and cortex cells . to compare _PROTEIN_ cellular localization of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ auxin influx and efflux carriers respectively in wild type and _PROTEIN_ roots gene constructs for _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were introgressed into the _PROTEIN_ mutant . _PROTEIN_ showed similar basal _LOCATION_ localization in cells of the vasculature in both vertically grown and gravistimulated wild type and _PROTEIN_ roots respectively . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ also displayed identical localization in the first columella tiers quiescent center and upper adjacent layers of dividing cells of wild type and _PROTEIN_ roots independently of gravistimulation . although the level of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein was somewhat lower compared with wild type in _PROTEIN_ roots its basal localization in stele cells and apolar pattern in the columella did not differ in vertically grown and gravistimulated wild type and _PROTEIN_ roots . using color coded heat maps for _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ localization in columella cells according to citation we found that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ showed apolar pm localization in of vertically positioned roots of both wild type and _PROTEIN_ plants . after min of gravistimulation by reorientation translocation of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ to basal pm was observed only in of both wild type and _PROTEIN_ roots in which _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ showed previous partial _PROTEIN_ also in the absence of gravistimulus as reported by citation . a subsequent time course indicated that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was nonpolarized and partially _PROTEIN_ in versus of vertically grown roots equally in both the wild type and _PROTEIN_ mutant and this ratio did not change during subsequent gravistimulation for or min . analogously _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ localization in the basal and inner _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ of root cap and basal pm of epidermal cells proved to be identical in wild type and _PROTEIN_ roots . whereas the _PROTEIN_ mutation appeared to have no effect on _PROTEIN_ localization of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ we found that the amount of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ reporter measured by heat maps was about twofold lower in the transition zone between the root cap and elongation zones of vertically grown _PROTEIN_ roots compared with the wild type . moreover in the transition zone the amount of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was markedly reduced in the upper pm of epidermal cells whereas _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ showed a basal to apical shift of pm localization in the adjacent cortex cells of _PROTEIN_ compared with the wild type . in contrast with previous reports however we failed to detect enhanced _LOCATION_ accumulation suggesting facilitated endocytosis and degradation of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in the light or dark grown _PROTEIN_ mutant . following h of gravistimulation by rotation _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ showed a typical asymmetric distribution in wild type roots due to its reduction in the upper and accumulation in the lower section of epidermal and cortex cell files . at the same time equal signal intensities were detected in the upper and lower sections of horizontally placed _PROTEIN_ roots indicating that symmetric distribution of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ remained unaltered upon h of gravistimulation . to confirm altered localization of _PROTEIN_ in the _PROTEIN_ mutant by an independent means we performed dual immunolocalization of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . whereas _PROTEIN_ similarly decorated the basal _LOCATION_ of vascular cells in both wild type and _PROTEIN_ roots immunolocalization detected similar changes in _PROTEIN_ localization as those seen with the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ reporter in _PROTEIN_ roots . to exclude potential artifacts we performed an alternative dual labeling approach in which _PROTEIN_ was colocalized with the pm h _PROTEIN_ . both series of immunolocalization experiments demonstrated that in cells below the transition zone _PROTEIN_ was properly localized in the apical and basal _LOCATION_ of epidermal and cortex files respectively as expected . however in epidermal cells of the _PROTEIN_ root transition zone the apical _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ localization was markedly diminished along with a change in _PROTEIN_ localization to apolar or apical in the adjacent cortex cells and accompanied by appearance of some _PROTEIN_ signal also in _LOCATION_ of endodermal cells . upwards of the _PROTEIN_ transition zone _PROTEIN_ was detected if at all as weak internalized signal in the epidermis and its localization was shifted to apical in the cortex . since such apical localization of _PROTEIN_ in the cortex induced by low concentration bfa treatment was previously demonstrated to abolish root gravitropic responses these data suggested that aberrant _PROTEIN_ localization of _PROTEIN_ in both epidermis and cortex was likely responsible for the delayed gravitropic response of _PROTEIN_ mutant roots . the altered _PROTEIN_ localization of _PROTEIN_ in cells of the transition zone and the generally reduced amount of _PROTEIN_ in epidermal and cortex cell _LOCATION_ of _PROTEIN_ roots compared with the wild type suggested a potential defect in _LOCATION_ recycling leading to destabilization of _PROTEIN_ . similarly to the effects of phosphatidylinositol monophosphate kinase we found that bfa treatment stimulated faster internalization of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ from epidermal cell _LOCATION_ of _PROTEIN_ roots compared with the wild type . upon min of treatment with bfa the number of bfa bodies was approximately threefold higher in _PROTEIN_ compared with the wild type and this difference was not balanced by prolonging the bfa treatment up to h . to exclude possible impact of de novo protein synthesis on enhanced accumulation of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in bfa bodies in control experiments wild type and _PROTEIN_ seedlings were treated with the protein biosynthesis inhibitor cycloheximide for min and then incubated with bfa and chx for min before removal of bfa and further treatment with chx for h . as without chx _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ showed approximately threefold higher accumulation in brefeldin bodies in bfa chx but not in chx treated _PROTEIN_ root cells compared with the wild type indicating that the _PROTEIN_ mutation decelerated bfa sensitive exocytosis of _PROTEIN_ without affecting its de novo synthesis . in support of the observations of citation we found that endocytosis of the _LOCATION_ specific dye was significantly slower in epidermal cells of _PROTEIN_ roots compared with the wild type . however showed slower internalization in the wild type compared with _PROTEIN_ in the presence of bfa as was indicated by the size of accumulating bfa bodies which increased with time during bfa treatment . as _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ recycling was demonstrated to be dependent on phosphorylation of central hydrophilic loops of _PROTEIN_ proteins we tested whether _PROTEIN_ was a candidate substrate of _PROTEIN_ . the hydrophilic t loop domain of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in escherichia coli and purified via n terminal tag was phosphorylated by _PROTEIN_ in vitro analogously to the control myelin basic protein .
