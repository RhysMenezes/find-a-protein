members of the plant type i mads domain subfamily have been reported to be involved in reproductive development in arabidopsis . however from the type i genes in the arabidopsis genome only _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ have been functionally characterized which revealed important roles for these genes during female gametophyte and early seed development . the functions of the other genes are still unknown despite the _PROTEIN_ that the available single t dna insertion mutants have been largely investigated . the lack of mutant phenotypes is likely due to a considerable number of recent intrachromosomal duplications in the type i subfamily resulting in nonfunctional genes in addition to a high level of redundancy . to enable a breakthrough in type i mads box gene characterization a framework needs to be established that allows the prediction of the functionality and redundancy of the type i genes . here we present a complete atlas of their _PROTEIN_ patterns during female gametophyte and seed development in arabidopsis deduced from reporter lines containing translational fusions of the genes to green _METHOD_ protein and _PROTEIN_ . all the _PROTEIN_ genes were revealed to be active in the female gametophyte or developing seed indicating that the entire type i subfamily is involved in reproductive development in arabidopsis . interestingly _PROTEIN_ was predominantly observed in the central cell antipodal cells and _PROTEIN_ endosperm . the combination of our _PROTEIN_ results with phylogenetic and protein interaction data allows a better identification of putative redundantly acting genes and provides a useful tool for the functional characterization of the type i mads box genes in arabidopsis .
the few characterized type i mads box genes from arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ are all _PROTEIN_ in the female gametophyte or developing seed . therefore we expected that several of the uncharacterized type i genes would also be _PROTEIN_ in these structures . both the female gametophyte and the endosperm have a syncytial phase during their development which complicates the interpretation of _PROTEIN_ patterns derived from promoter reporter constructs . to obtain a detailed overview of the _PROTEIN_ patterns of the arabidopsis type i mads box genes therefore we generated translational fusions of the genes with _METHOD_ and gus _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . because mads box genes belong to a family of transcription _PROTEIN_ the fusion proteins are expected to be translocated to the _LOCATION_ which facilitates the precise determination of spatial _PROTEIN_ in the syncytial stages . we generated fusion constructs for all arabidopsis type i mads box genes identified by citation except for _PROTEIN_ which has been annotated as a pseudogene and _PROTEIN_ which is inserted in the coding region of another gene and therefore probably is a pseudogene as well . in addition we also investigated the _PROTEIN_ of the type gene _PROTEIN_ which for unclear reasons is not present in the study of citation . in total we studied the _PROTEIN_ of type i mads box genes from arabidopsis type genes type genes and type genes . for each construct we amplified the genomic region of the gene from bp upstream of the _PROTEIN_ until just before the stop codon including any predicted intronic regions . however if the next upstream locus was present within the kb upstream region only the part up to that locus was used in the construct . all constructs were successfully introduced to arabidopsis by floral dip transformation except for the constructs for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ which repeatedly failed to yield transgenic seedlings . to determine the _PROTEIN_ patterns of the arabidopsis type i mads box genes tissues from plants transformed with paglx _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ gus constructs were incubated in gus buffer for to d. _METHOD_ signal could only be observed if the gus signal was already visible after one night of staining . however in many cases the _PROTEIN_ level of the genes is so low that gus _PROTEIN_ could only be detected after d of staining and no _METHOD_ profile was obtained . the _PROTEIN_ patterns for every gene are presented in supplemental figure where information about the number of analyzed lines is also included . we obtained _PROTEIN_ profiles for of the genes for which transgenic paglx _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ gus lines were studied . no gus signal was observed in the transgenic lines of the remaining genes . all _PROTEIN_ genes were found to be predominantly active in the female gametophyte or the developing seed . the observed _PROTEIN_ profiles in both structures are shown in figure . for each cell type in which gus or _METHOD_ signal was observed a representative image from one of the _PROTEIN_ genes is displayed . a complete overview of the _PROTEIN_ patterns of the arabidopsis type i mads box genes is presented in figure . the genes in the _PROTEIN_ table are arranged according to their phylogeny to facilitate the comparison of the _PROTEIN_ patterns of paralogous genes . in the embryo sac _PROTEIN_ was predominantly found in the central cell and antipodal cells in the final developmental stages _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . although a few genes are also _PROTEIN_ at earlier stages of megagametogenesis _PROTEIN_ was never observed in the egg cell or synergids suggesting that type i mads box genes specifically play a role in the determination and functioning of the _PROTEIN_ cell types . in the developing seed _PROTEIN_ was often detected shortly after fertilization in the endosperm and sometimes in the embryo . during seed development the _PROTEIN_ of many type i genes became restricted to the _PROTEIN_ endosperm which remains a syncytium . the overview in figure focuses on the _PROTEIN_ in the female gametophyte and developing seed . however several genes were found to be _PROTEIN_ in other tissues as well . this _PROTEIN_ is summarized in the last column of the table but is presented in more detail in supplemental figure . we relatively often observed blue staining in mature pollen of the different transgenic lines . however pollen of wild type arabidopsis plants also appears bluish after gus staining . therefore we only assigned a signal to pollen in the _PROTEIN_ data if it was clearly higher than background levels . we did not observe gus signal in any of the transgenic lines from of the studied genes . from these genes six belong to the class _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ eight to the class _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and six are type genes _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . the absence of gus _PROTEIN_ in these transgenic lines probably has different causes . first it is possible that we did not detect the gus signal because the gene is only active under certain environmental conditions or because the _PROTEIN_ is too weak or very transient . we primarily focused on the female gametophyte and developing seed and may have overlooked specific _PROTEIN_ in other tissue types . a drawback of promoter coding sequence _METHOD_ gus constructs is that the signal of the chimeric protein is usually lower than that of _METHOD_ gus under the control of the promoter alone . this difference in signal strength was obvious for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ for which we studied both promoter reporter and promoter coding sequence reporter lines . the levels of gus and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and the number of _PROTEIN_ transgenic lines were considerably higher in the plants transformed with the promoter reporter construct . therefore we can not exclude that we did not observe gus _PROTEIN_ for very weakly _PROTEIN_ genes which we would have observed if a promoter reporter construct had been used . in addition it is possible that the gene is _PROTEIN_ in a certain tissue but that the protein is absent because it is unstable or actively degraded . a second explanation is that the upstream regulatory region used in our constructs did not cover all cis regulatory elements required for the _PROTEIN_ of the gene . in a few cases the kb promoter region that we used for the constructs may not have been sufficient because cis elements farther upstream or from the coding sequence are required for the correct _PROTEIN_ of the gene . this may very well be the case for the type genes _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ which do not appear to be _PROTEIN_ in our studies but have recently been found to play a role in endosperm development . the intergenic region upstream of both genes is approximately kb and important cis elements may thus be located beyond the kb fragment used in the construct . the fragment used for _PROTEIN_ a close homolog of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ probably also does not contain all elements important for correct _PROTEIN_ . although we found _PROTEIN_ for _PROTEIN_ in the anthers and the antipodal cells citation reported the presence of _PROTEIN_ transcripts in the endosperm at d after pollination . similarly the other genes in the same clade _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ may also be _PROTEIN_ in the endosperm despite the _PROTEIN_ that we did not observe any gus _PROTEIN_ in the corresponding transgenic lines . to test the _PROTEIN_ of these five genes in the endosperm we performed quantitative reverse transcription pcr experiments with cdna from siliques to d after pollination pistils with stage _PROTEIN_ embryo sacs and leaves . we did not detect any significant transcript for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in any of the three tissues suggesting that both genes are really not _PROTEIN_ in the female gametophyte or developing seed . the q rt pcr results for the other genes are presented in figure . the graphs show the relative _PROTEIN_ of the genes in the different tissues . the graphs confirm the _PROTEIN_ for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in developing seeds shortly after fertilization and show that both genes are not evidently _PROTEIN_ in the embryo sac or the leaf . _PROTEIN_ appears to be more ubiquitously _PROTEIN_ since distinct _PROTEIN_ can be found in all three tissues . in addition to the observed _PROTEIN_ in the antipodal cells and anthers _PROTEIN_ is probably also active in leaves and developing seeds . to investigate if a larger promoter fragment of _PROTEIN_ would indeed result in an extended activity we generated a promoter reporter construct with the complete kb upstream region of _PROTEIN_ . several _METHOD_ gus lines showed _PROTEIN_ in the developing seed although the _PROTEIN_ appeared relatively weak . the _PROTEIN_ profile resembles that of _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ in the early endosperm _LOCATION_ embryo and _PROTEIN_ endosperm . these results reveal in combination with the q rt pcr results that the promoter fragments that we used to generate the fusion constructs for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were most likely not sufficient and lack certain essential cis regulatory elements . a third possibility is that the genes are really not _PROTEIN_ because they lost essential regulatory elements during evolution . a high number of type i mads box genes originated recently via intrachromosomal duplications . this occurs often via unequal crossing over where one of the chromosomes acquires a duplicated region while that region is deleted from the other chromosome . if a gene is duplicated via this mode its regulatory region may be disrupted resulting in an altered _PROTEIN_ or silencing of the gene . in arabidopsis these recent duplication events can be found in particular within the subclass of type genes where clusters of duplicated genes were identified on chromosomes i and v . to investigate if some type i mads box genes may have lost their regulatory region due to intrachromosomal duplication we analyzed the sizes of the putative promoters . this revealed that the promoters of the nonexpressed genes _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are less than bp suggesting that these genes may have been immediately silenced after duplication by the loss of their regulatory region . however whether these genes are really pseudogenes can not be conclusively determined based on their promoter size . also the weakly _PROTEIN_ genes _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ have a promoter region that is shorter than bp . the constructs for the type gene _PROTEIN_ and the type gene _PROTEIN_ were not successfully transformed to arabidopsis therefore detailed _PROTEIN_ data for these genes are not presented . to obtain some information about their activity q rt pcr was performed on the same tissues as for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ for _PROTEIN_ was not detected but _PROTEIN_ transcript levels were high in leaves pistils and siliques and it may thus be worthwhile to characterize this gene further in the future . the type i mads box genes in plants are further subdivided into and type genes . phylogenetic studies revealed that the and type genes from arabidopsis share a common ancestor while the type genes may not be monophyletic with the clade . although all duplications within the three type i subclasses presumably occurred after the divergence of monocots and dicots comparison of the arabidopsis and poplar type i mads box genes suggests that the expansion and subsequent divergence of genes occurred earlier in the type subclass than in the and type subclasses . in agreement with this observation we find that the _PROTEIN_ patterns of the arabidopsis type genes have diverged more than those of the and type genes . the type genes show a wide range of different _PROTEIN_ patterns in the female gametophyte and developing seed and can be divided into two groups based on the levels of their _PROTEIN_ . the first group contains genes that are distinctly _PROTEIN_ the second group contains only weakly _PROTEIN_ genes . within the first group two distinct clades can be recognized in which the genes share more or less the same _PROTEIN_ patterns . the first clade contains the genes _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ have already been functionally characterized and revealed to play a role in central cell development _PROTEIN_ endosperm development _PROTEIN_ and early embryo sac and seed development _PROTEIN_ . we confirmed the _PROTEIN_ patterns of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in the developing seed . however gus signal for _PROTEIN_ during early female gametophyte development as reported by citation was not detected in our studies although we used a comparable upstream region for the analysis . we detected the earliest _LOCATION_ localized gus signal for _PROTEIN_ in the central cell of stage _PROTEIN_ ovules . the functions of the other two genes in the clade _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are still unknown but their _PROTEIN_ in the embryo endosperm _LOCATION_ and _PROTEIN_ endosperm of developing seeds suggests that both genes may have overlapping functions with _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ is a remarkable type i mads box gene because it is _PROTEIN_ in a wide range of tissues in addition to its _PROTEIN_ in the embryo sac and developing seed . we observed _PROTEIN_ in hypocotyl cotyledon root and leaf tips in the stem and inflorescence and in young leaves . these data are in conformance with the study of citation who found that _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ in vegetative tissues . whether _PROTEIN_ really plays a role in flowering as suggested by the _PROTEIN_ overexpression phenotype remains to be investigated . the second clade contains the paralogs _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . these genes are all distinctly _PROTEIN_ in the embryo and the peripheral endosperm . the _PROTEIN_ that no mutant phenotypes have been found for any of these genes suggests that they function in a redundant manner . this may also be the case for the paralogous genes _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ which have overlapping _PROTEIN_ patterns in the _PROTEIN_ endosperm . finally we also observed a distinct and interesting _PROTEIN_ pattern for _PROTEIN_ which is highly homologous to _PROTEIN_ . the gene is already _PROTEIN_ during the early stages of megagametogenesis from the one nucleate stage onward _PROTEIN_ . the gus signal can be detected in the course of embryo sac development in several _LOCATION_ until it becomes restricted to the antipodal _LOCATION_ in stage _PROTEIN_ . although we did not precisely determine the spatial and temporal _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ its activity in certain _LOCATION_ during megagametogenesis may indicate a role in cell fate specification . we did not observe gus signal in the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ gus transgenic lines suggesting that _PROTEIN_ does not function in a redundant manner with _PROTEIN_ . the group of weakly _PROTEIN_ genes constitutes one large clade containing _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . we did not observe any gus _PROTEIN_ for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ while the other five genes are specifically _PROTEIN_ in the female gametophyte . occasionally gus signal for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ was observed in unspecified _LOCATION_ of stage _PROTEIN_ embryo sacs but the clearest signal was found for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in the central cell and for _PROTEIN_ in the antipodal cells of stage _PROTEIN_ female gametophytes . the type genes for which _PROTEIN_ was observed are all relatively strongly _PROTEIN_ . except for _PROTEIN_ which is predominantly _PROTEIN_ in the central cell all type genes were revealed to be most strongly _PROTEIN_ in the developing seed . we did not detect gus signal for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ but these genes are active in the developing seed as discussed above . the gene clade consisting of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ contains interesting genes that have been shown to be involved in endosperm proliferation . _PROTEIN_ is an imprinted gene that is paternally _PROTEIN_ in the developing seed . although the _PROTEIN_ single mutant does not show an aberrant phenotype down regulation of _PROTEIN_ in a mea mutant does partially rescue the embryo and endosperm overproliferation phenotype . recently citation found that in addition to _PROTEIN_ also _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are important for endosperm development . in developing seeds from incompatible interhybrid crosses between arabidopsis and arabidopsis arenosa the _PROTEIN_ of the five genes is increased compared with seeds from compatible crosses . in correspondence with the _PROTEIN_ that we did not observe _PROTEIN_ for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ both genes were not identified in the study of citation suggesting that they are actually silenced and may be considered as pseudogenes . in support of this idea the _PROTEIN_ coding sequence lacks the motif which is hypothesized to be required for heterodimerization . several single mutants of genes in the _PROTEIN_ cluster have been studied but none has been found to exhibit a mutant phenotype suggesting that the genes function in a redundant manner . whether _PROTEIN_ also contributes to endosperm development is still unclear but the broad _PROTEIN_ profile of this gene suggests that its function has at least partly diverged . _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ in the globular embryo and probably in the embryo surrounding endosperm . the protein was found to interact with the type protein _PROTEIN_ which is colocalized in the embryo . the gene clade to which _PROTEIN_ belongs also contains _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ for which no _PROTEIN_ was observed and _PROTEIN_ which is also embryo _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ is most likely a silenced pseudogene because its coding sequence contains an early stop codon just downstream from the mads box . the activity of both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in the embryo suggests that both genes function in a redundant manner in embryo development probably in a complex with the embryo _PROTEIN_ type paralogs _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . however evidence for the interaction between the members of both clades is confined to the observation by citation that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ form a heterodimer in yeast . finally the closely related genes _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are both _PROTEIN_ in the endosperm . _PROTEIN_ is an interesting gene because it is the only type i mads box gene that is specifically _PROTEIN_ in the peripheral endosperm and not in the _PROTEIN_ endosperm . the gene is highly homologous to _PROTEIN_ for which we did not manage to generate a _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ gus construct . although we produced several entry clones of the genomic _PROTEIN_ sequence these clones repeatedly failed to recombine with the destination vector . therefore we analyzed _METHOD_ gus plants which revealed that _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ in the peripheral and _PROTEIN_ endosperm of developing seeds . possibly _PROTEIN_ functions redundantly with _PROTEIN_ in the peripheral endosperm . in contrast to the type genes the type mads box genes are _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in the female gametophyte . their _PROTEIN_ is in general weak comparable to the levels of the type genes _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ the proteins of which interact with the type proteins . clades with different _PROTEIN_ patterns can not be distinguished within the subclass and it appears that all genes belong to one large cluster which is active in the central cell . this suggests a high redundancy and would explain why no mutant of an type gene has been identified so far . however within the large clade several individual genes evolved additional _PROTEIN_ patterns and may have acquired other functions . especially _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ which are more strongly _PROTEIN_ than the other type genes and also active in other tissues are interesting in this respect . other interesting genes are _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ which are active in the central cell and during early megagametogenesis and _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ which are _PROTEIN_ in the antipodal cells . mads domain transcription _PROTEIN_ act predominantly as heterodimers or higher order complexes to regulate the _PROTEIN_ of downstream targets . citation published an interaction map of the arabidopsis mads domain proteins based on yeast two hybrid experiments . this study revealed that type i mads domain proteins interact predominantly with other type i proteins and that type proteins preferably heterodimerize with or type proteins whereas interactions within one subclass are rare . interestingly the type genes that are distinctly _PROTEIN_ and belong to the _PROTEIN_ clade encode proteins that only form heterodimers with type proteins whereas the genes that are only weakly _PROTEIN_ in the female gametophyte _PROTEIN_ encode proteins that interact with type proteins . this suggests that both gene clades not only diverged in their _PROTEIN_ patterns but that the proteins also evolved different interaction specificities . this protein divergence also occurred to a certain extent within the different clades resulting in less redundancy than was inferred on the basis of the _PROTEIN_ profiles and phylogeny . therefore integration of our _PROTEIN_ data with the interaction data of citation allows a more reliable prediction of which type i mads domain complexes actually play a role in planta and provides more insight into the possible redundancy among the type i genes . citation reported that three type i mads box proteins _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ form interactions with many other type i and mikc type proteins . however our study shows that these genes are not _PROTEIN_ and that the heterodimers are thus not formed in planta . the majority of the other type i heterodimers identified by citation are formed between proteins that are colocalized in certain cell types . figure lists the heterodimers that are most likely present in the central cell antipodal cells embryo and _PROTEIN_ endosperm . these data show that in every cell type different combinations of closely related proteins result in many possible complexes . however if all putative redundant complexes are considered the same the central cell and embryo contain only two types of heterodimers while the antipodal cells and the _PROTEIN_ endosperm have three . these results suggest that the nonredundant type i complexes fulfill different functions in female gametophyte and seed development . however especially in the endosperm proteins from the same clade have probably evolved different functions and more nonredundant complexes may exist . this can be concluded from the _PROTEIN_ that the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ single mutants exhibit different mutant phenotypes and that several genes like _PROTEIN_ have very particular _PROTEIN_ patterns . in addition several distinctly _PROTEIN_ genes like _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ encode proteins that did not dimerize with other mads domain proteins in the yeast two hybrid screen but may be involved in mads complexes in planta or interact with other transcription _PROTEIN_ . the total number of functional nonredundant complexes may thus be higher than . analysis of the type i _PROTEIN_ patterns also revealed interesting information about the development of the endosperm shortly after fertilization . the localization of the type protein _PROTEIN_ appeared especially remarkable therefore we studied it in more detail . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ gus was observed for the first time shortly after fertilization in the initial endosperm _LOCATION_ positioned at the micropylar end . although the number of endosperm _LOCATION_ increases thereafter exponentially the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signal remained restricted to three or four _LOCATION_ which appeared to migrate from the micropylar to the _PROTEIN_ end to form the _PROTEIN_ endosperm . this suggests that _PROTEIN_ endosperm identity is already established in the first endosperm _LOCATION_ and persists after division only in those _LOCATION_ that are destined to become the _PROTEIN_ endosperm while it becomes lost from the other _LOCATION_ . gus staining of the developing seeds with the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ gus construct shows a similar pattern although a weak signal could also be detected in the other endosperm _LOCATION_ due to the higher sensitivity of the method . nevertheless the _PROTEIN_ reporter appears to be a perfect marker in which to study the determination of the _PROTEIN_ endosperm . we also tested whether _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is regulated via imprinting like the _PROTEIN_ of its homolog _PROTEIN_ but reciprocal crosses revealed that the gene is _PROTEIN_ from both the paternal and the maternal transgenes approximately h after pollination . in addition to the _PROTEIN_ reporter line several other _PROTEIN_ reporter lines appear very suitable for marker line use . we found that the _PROTEIN_ protein is also present in the pollen tube which was not reported before . to investigate this further we pollinated wild type pistils with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ gus pollen . the _METHOD_ signal was clearly visible in germinating pollen on the stigma and could subsequently be observed throughout the growing pollen tube . after entering the embryo sac via the micropyle the signal was released in the penetrated synergid cell . the _METHOD_ signal was more specific than the gus signal and was concentrated in the growing tip where the two generative _LOCATION_ are located . because the _METHOD_ signal is released in the synergid cell upon the entrance of the pollen tube the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ gus lines are good markers to show that the pollen tube is actually penetrating the embryo sac . within the context of the female gametophyte the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ reporter constructs can be used to show central cell identity while the reporters of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are specifically active in the antipodal cells . also many _PROTEIN_ endosperm markers are available like _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . finally we identified the _PROTEIN_ reporter to be specific for the peripheral endosperm .
arabidopsis plants were grown in a growth chamber with a h h dark cycle at . seeds resulting from floral dip transformation were sterilized for min in ethanol and min in bleach washed three times in sterile water and germinated on half strength murashige and skoog selective plates . after d of incubation in a growth chamber resistant plants were transferred to soil . the reporter constructs were generated using the gateway system . genomic fragments including up to kb of promoter region and terminating just before the stop codon were amplified from columbia genomic dna using gene specific primers with additional nucleotides for integration into the entry vector . the sequences of the primers are listed in supplemental table . entry vectors were either constructed using the topo system or via the _PROTEIN_ reaction by recombination of the pcr fragments into or . the entry vectors were subsequently recombined with the destination vector or . the resulting clones were sequenced from both sides with primers and and the frame was checked with primer _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ . the constructs for the type genes were completely sequenced . the resulting vectors were transformed into agrobacterium tumefaciens using freeze thaw transformation . transformation of arabidopsis wild type columbia plants was performed using the floral dip method as described by citation . gus activity was analyzed by staining various tissues to d at in staining solution _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . if necessary pistils were incised on both sides for optimal staining of the ovules . ovules were cleared in lactic glycerol and observed on a zeiss axiovert microscope using differential interference contrast optics . for analysis of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ pistils were dissected on a microscope slide in mm phosphate buffer and observed with confocal laser scanning microscopy using a leica tcs microscope . _METHOD_ was excited with an argon laser and emission was detected between and nm . the arabidopsis type i mads box protein sequences were aligned with clustalw . the alignment was transferred to bioedit and adjusted by hand and the first sites were used to generate a neighbor joining tree in bioedit . the tree file was opened in treeview and rooted with the clade . leaf pistil and silique samples were harvested from columbia wild type arabidopsis plants . rna was extracted using the qiagen rneasy plant mini kit and cdna was synthesized with the iscript cdna synthesis kit . real time rt pcr was performed with the iq sybr green supermix from bio rad . the following pcr program was used min at followed by cycles of s at and s at . two biological and two technical replicates were performed . a polyubiquitin gene was used as reference gene . the primers are listed in supplemental table . the gene names and their arabidopsis genome initiative numbers are listed in supplemental table . the following materials are available in the online version of this article . supplemental figure . _METHOD_ signal observed for the different paglx _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ gus transgenic lines . supplemental table . primers used to generate the paglx _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ gus constructs and primers used for the q rt pcr experiment . supplemental table . putative promoter lengths of the type i mads box genes .
