a functional relationship between monothiol glutaredoxins and bolas has been unraveled by genomic analyses and in several high throughput studies . phylogenetic analyses coupled to transient _PROTEIN_ of green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ fusions indicated that in addition to the sulfurtransferase _PROTEIN_ which contains a c terminal bola domain three bola _METHOD_ exist in arabidopsis thaliana being _LOCATION_ nucleo cytoplasmic and dual targeted to mitochondria and _LOCATION_ . binary yeast two hybrid experiments demonstrated that all bolas and _PROTEIN_ via its bola domain can interact with all monothiol glutaredoxins . most interactions between protein couples of the same subcellular compartment have been confirmed by bimolecular _METHOD_ complementation . in vitro experiments indicated that monothiol glutaredoxins could regulate the redox state of and _PROTEIN_ both proteins possessing a single conserved reactive cysteine . indeed a glutathionylated form of _PROTEIN_ lost its capacity to activate the cysteine desulfurase but it is reactivated by _LOCATION_ glutaredoxins . besides a monomeric glutathionylated form and a dimeric disulfide bridged form of can be preferentially reduced by the nucleo cytoplasmic _PROTEIN_ . these results indicate that the glutaredoxin bola interaction occurs in several subcellular compartments and suggest that a redox regulation mechanism disconnected from their capacity to form iron sulfur cluster bridged heterodimers may be physiologically relevant for and _PROTEIN_ .
in order to establish an accurate classification of bola proteins that can be used in all _METHOD_ a total of sequences most of them complete have been retrieved from prokaryotes but also from eukaryotes either photosynthetic or non photosynthetic . archaea and cyanobacteria analyzed possess only one bola isoform whereas other _METHOD_ analyzed generally have an expanded family comprising two to four bola _METHOD_ distributed in three major clades representing three monophyletic groups as revealed by phylogenetic analyses . however the careful analysis of the protein sequences and properties led us to propose four different classes named and based on the classification used for mammalian bolas . all _METHOD_ analyzed except archaea and cyanobacteria possess at least one member . sequences from related genera cluster together the algal and fungal members forming a single group . the ancestor is likely the bacterial bola version and some duplication or gene fusion occurred in the green lineage . duplication apparently occurred independently in micromonas pusilla oryza sativa and glycine max as these are the only _METHOD_ analyzed possessing more than one isoform . moreover fusion proteins between an n terminal sufe domain and a c terminal bola domain named _PROTEIN_ and exclusively restricted to some algae and land plants cluster with members . this chimeric protein is absent in cyanobacteria and in prasinophyceae but present in chlorophyceae . this suggests that the gene fusion event occurred after the split between prasinophyceae an early diverging class within the green lineage and chlorophyceae . and classes are specific to eukaryote _METHOD_ since no ortholog was found in prokaryotes and they likely derive from a single ancestral gene . the class is found in all eukaryotes analyzed and contains orthologs of the functionally characterized yeast _PROTEIN_ protein . they all possess one isoform except arabidopsis lyrata which has two _METHOD_ probably due to a specific and very recent duplication event as a. thaliana possesses only one member . chlorella and ostreococcus _METHOD_ form an isolated branch in the phylogenetic tree being more distantly related to other members . the class is restricted to non photosynthetic eukaryotes with the exceptions of the two algae c. reinhardtii and v. carteri . this is not that surprising as some genes deriving from the last plant animal common ancestor have been retained in chlamydomonas and animals but lost in _METHOD_ . interestingly in addition to a strictly conserved c terminal histidine present in all bolas proteins of these two classes possess a conserved cysteine in position which might have a structurally or catalytically important function . nevertheless two major differences in the primary sequence allow distinguishing and _METHOD_ . in sequences the cysteine is included in a very conserved sggcg motif and the his is systematically followed by a gly whereas in the cysteine containing motif is more variable and the hg motif is replaced by an ha motif as in and _METHOD_ . the last class not defined before has been called and it contains orthologs of e. coli yrba . proteins are only present in archaea bacteria cyanobacteria and photosynthetic eukaryotes but are absent in all other eukaryotes . the simplest evolutionary hypothesis would be that the yrba ancestor gene has been conserved in cyanobacteria and then in the whole green lineage and that it has been specifically acquired in halobacteriales . interestingly this is the unique bola present in cyanobacteria and archaea . among the four proteins containing a bola domain in a. thaliana a dual targeting in chloroplasts and mitochondria has been experimentally determined for _PROTEIN_ . in order to determine the subcellular localization of other arabidopsis bolas chimeric proteins obtained by fusing the whole sequence of arabidopsis and to green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ have been used for transient _PROTEIN_ experiments using tobacco leaves . a clear _METHOD_ signal for was detected both in the _LOCATION_ and in the _LOCATION_ . concerning the reporter protein is directed to the chloroplast as indicated by the superimposition of the _METHOD_ signal with the chlorophyll auto _METHOD_ in merged images . for two distinct _METHOD_ signals consistent with a _LOCATION_ and mitochondrial dual targeting have been obtained . it is worth mentioning that similar results have been obtained after _PROTEIN_ in tobacco mesophyll epidermal and guard cells . though we have to be cautious because overexpression might sometimes lead to mistargeting and is a small protein the nucleo cytoplasmic localization of is consistent with the observation that _METHOD_ fusions involving the yeast _PROTEIN_ and human orthologs are also found in both compartments . we next assessed the ability of bola proteins to interact with grxs first using a binary based yeast two hybrid approach . by comparison with two representatives of class i grxs _PROTEIN_ and we found that only class ii/cgfs grxs were able to physically interact with mono domain bolas . except for the couple all other co transformed yeast cells were able to grow in the presence of the enzyme inhibitor aminotriazol up to a concentration of indicating that corresponding interactions are strong . moreover it indicates that all cgfs grxs and bolas contain the motifs and/or structural arrangement necessary for a physical interaction _PROTEIN_ of their subcellular compartmentalization or of their domain architecture . as _PROTEIN_ is an atypical protein composed of four different modules an n terminal thioredoxin like domain followed by three cgfs domains we next analyzed the capacity of each module to interact with bolas . whereas the n terminal trx domain does not interact by itself with any bola we found that the second module of _PROTEIN_ was sufficient to allow interaction with all bolas . this suggests that this domain is the one primarily responsible for the observed interactions with bolas . then the interaction of the multi domain _PROTEIN_ protein with class i and ii grxs was explored using a similar approach . interestingly an interaction of _PROTEIN_ was also observed with all cgfs grxs but with a higher specificity than that observed with canonical bolas . indeed when stringency using was increased only the interactions with and _PROTEIN_ were _PROTEIN_ . testing the isolated domains of _PROTEIN_ with their putative _LOCATION_ and mitochondrial grx partners and we observed that only the _PROTEIN_ bola domain of _PROTEIN_ was involved in the interaction . the _PROTEIN_ that the _PROTEIN_ bola domain but not the whole _PROTEIN_ protein could interact with and at high stringency indicates that the _PROTEIN_ sufe domain limited the interaction with the full length _PROTEIN_ . finally in order to determine whether the active site cysteine of these grxs is required for the interaction we tested grx mutants namely and . we found that replacing the cgfs redox center by sgfs in weakened grx/bola interaction as yeast growth _PROTEIN_ and was even abolished in the presence of . this indicates that although the catalytic cysteine is dispensable its presence reinforces the interaction strength with partner proteins . conversely a sgfs mutation in does not seem to affect its interaction with canonical bola proteins suggesting that other types of interactions might be primarily responsible for interactions with partner proteins . a different situation was observed for interactions involving _PROTEIN_ . the mutation of the active site cysteine in both and drastically reduced the strength of the interactions as the yeast cells exhibited a highly reduced or null growth even in the absence of . overall this reveals different behaviors or pattern of interactions of cgfs grxs towards the different classes of bolas . the cgfs grx bola interactions were also assayed in arabidopsis protoplasts by bifc experiments . for this purpose pair combinations of constructs producing bola and grx proteins fused to half parts of yellow _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ were tested _PROTEIN_ of their previously determined subcellular localization _PROTEIN_ or of previous yeast two hybrid results . a reconstitution of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ reporting interactions between the fused partners and co localizing with the chloroplast compartment was observed when and _PROTEIN_ constructs were independently co transformed with either or constructs . all these results were confirmed using constructs _PROTEIN_ proteins fused to the other half _METHOD_ . co transfection of arabidopsis protoplasts with and also led to bifc and was the only one exhibiting a dual _LOCATION_ and mitochondrial pattern . on the other hand co transfection did not promote _METHOD_ reconstitution whereas co transfection led to very few cells exhibiting _METHOD_ reconstitution in the chloroplast only pattern that we were unable to confirm with fusion proteins cloned in the alternative orientation except in one cell . hence we did not consider this interaction as positive . none of the _LOCATION_ grx could reconstitute bifc when co _PROTEIN_ with . _PROTEIN_ was the only grx allowing the reconstitution of the _METHOD_ when co transfected with giving rise to a bifc in the _LOCATION_ and in the _LOCATION_ . a similar result was obtained with the alternative cloning orientation . no _METHOD_ was obtained when and _PROTEIN_ were assayed with this grx isoform . these results confirmed that most of the grx/bola and bifc complexes are formed in vivo with _METHOD_ patterns compatible with the subcellular localization of the concerned proteins . the mature form of all bola proteins devoid of n terminal targeting sequences in the case of _PROTEIN_ and have been _PROTEIN_ as recombinant proteins in e. coli . the separation of as purified proteins in reducing or non reducing _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ indicated that a significant amount of can form a dimer and that the proportion of dimeric protein gradually increased upon storage . accordingly _METHOD_ _METHOD_ analyses revealed the presence of two protein peaks with molecular _METHOD_ of and . the first peak is consistent with a monomeric protein where the first methionine is cleaved whereas the second peak corresponds to a size compatible with a dimeric . upon reduction a single peak with a molecular _METHOD_ of was detected indicating that the dimeric protein contains an intermolecular disulfide bond . considering that possesses a single conserved cysteine residue _PROTEIN_ which _METHOD_ to be reactive we analyzed its sensitivity to oxidative conditions . oxidative treatments of h with glutathione disulfide or nitroso glutathione have been performed on a pre reduced protein using optimal ratios between protein and oxidizing agent of and respectively as determined by dose dependent response curves . for each experiment the redox state was analyzed both by _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and after thiol alkylation . indeed reduced and oxidized _METHOD_ of can be distinguished after alkylation by mpeg maleimide and migration on non reducing _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . as shown in both treatments led to oxidation . in the presence of gsno is exclusively detected as a monomeric oxidized form . accordingly a single peak of was obtained . the _METHOD_ increment of compared to the molecular _METHOD_ of the reduced form is consistent with a protein having one glutathione adduct . for gssg treated two protein peaks a major one of and a minor one of have been detected which correspond respectively to a glutathionylated monomer and to a disulfide bridged dimer . the formation of dimeric _METHOD_ only with gssg might be related to the difference of reactivity compared to gsno . indeed since the reaction with gssg is slower some reduced bola monomers are likely available during the time course of the reaction to react with glutathionylated bola promoting the formation of this disulfide bridged dimer . among other bolas only _PROTEIN_ also contains a single conserved cysteine . however it is located in the _PROTEIN_ sufe domain and it is indispensable for the _PROTEIN_ dependent activation of activity . in order to determine whether this observation could prefigure a redox regulation mechanism the possibility that the cysteine of _PROTEIN_ is sensitive to oxidative conditions was also investigated . whereas an h o treatment has no effect on the protein an oxidative treatment with a fold excess of gsno the best glutathionylation agent in this case prevented alkylation by mpeg maleimide indicating that the cysteine is indeed oxidized . _METHOD_ _METHOD_ analysis revealed the presence of a major protein peak corresponding to a molecular _METHOD_ of . comparing this molecular _METHOD_ to that of the untreated recombinant protein pointed to a _METHOD_ increment of for one of the peaks indicating that the protein is glutathionylated . altogether these in vitro experiments demonstrated that can undergo different oxidation states being either glutathionylated or forming covalent homodimers depending on the conditions used and that _PROTEIN_ can be glutathionylated . we then investigated the influence of _PROTEIN_ glutathionylation on its ability to stimulate activity and its possible regulation by glutaredoxins . cysteine desulfurase activity is usually assessed by measuring sulfur released from cysteine in the presence of dtt . while dtt is essential for reducing the persulfide formed on the catalytic cysteine of its presence would prevent evaluating the impact of grxs on a glutathionylated _PROTEIN_ . hence we have established an activity assay where dtt is replaced by the physiological gsh reducing system composed of nadph _PROTEIN_ and gsh . the amount of sulfur released is _PROTEIN_ nearly two fold compared to the dtt assay and we confirmed that _PROTEIN_ still stimulates activity in these conditions . we have also determined by testing isolated _PROTEIN_ domains that this activation is dependent on the _PROTEIN_ sufe domain but not the _PROTEIN_ bola domain . the difference observed between _PROTEIN_ and the _PROTEIN_ sufe domain may eventually indicate that _PROTEIN_ bola can contribute to protein protein interactions . however the difference might simply reflect the instability of the _PROTEIN_ sufe domain compared to full length _PROTEIN_ . indeed the _PROTEIN_ and purification of _PROTEIN_ sufe were complicated by the _PROTEIN_ that the protein was produced in majority in the insoluble fraction and was prone to precipitation upon storage and to aggregation . as expected the stimulation of activity is strongly reduced though not completely in the presence of glutathionylated _PROTEIN_ . the residual activity is assumed to originate from the capacity of gsh alone to slightly deglutathionylate _PROTEIN_ over the time course experiment as shown by the alkylation assay . next we tested the capacity of all known _LOCATION_ a. thaliana grxs to deglutathionylate _PROTEIN_ by pre incubating a fully glutathionylated _PROTEIN_ with a nadph/gr/gsh/grx system . the measurement of sulfur released and of the _PROTEIN_ redox state indicates that _PROTEIN_ and are more efficient than and that only partially reduced and reactivated _PROTEIN_ . this may be due to the generally lower oxidoreductase activity recorded for monothiol grxs at least in the presence of an in vitro gsh reducing system . using the same alkylation procedure the ability of three cytoplasmic disulfide reductases _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and to reduce the glutathionylated or dimeric _METHOD_ of was assessed . the glutathionylated protein was obtained after a gsno treatment and the dimeric form was obtained from the as isolated protein after separation from the monomer by size exclusion chromatography . after min reaction dtt was able to completely reduce the glutathionylated monomeric form but only partially the disulfide bond present in the dimeric form . a system was clearly inefficient for the reduction of any oxidized form since only a negligible fraction of glutathionylated was reduced . gsh alone or in combination with nadph and _PROTEIN_ used to mimic the physiological conditions and to _PROTEIN_ a fully reduced gsh pool can only partially reduce the glutathionylated monomeric form but not at all the dimeric form . adding either _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ allowed a full reduction of glutathionylated . interestingly _PROTEIN_ was more efficient than _PROTEIN_ for the reduction of the disulfide bridged dimer . in order to investigate redox properties the p k a of _PROTEIN_ and the midpoint redox potential of both oxidized _METHOD_ were determined . using the thiol cleavable fluorophore pdt bimane we have obtained a p k a value of indicating that the thiolate ion will be the dominant species at higher ph values whereas the protonated thiol will be dominant at lower ph values . besides the regeneration of oxidized proteins is also driven by thermodynamic properties such as the e m values for disulfide/dithiol couples . an e m value of mv was obtained for the dimeric form and a value of mv for the glutathionylated form . the more electronegative redox potential of the intermolecular disulfide bond in the dimer might partly explain why it is less efficiently reduced compared to the glutathione adduct but other _PROTEIN_ as steric hindrance or electrostatic interactions may also play a role as the tested trx was inefficient in reducing the disulfide bond .
