flavonoids represent one of the oldest largest and most diverse families of plant secondary metabolites . these compounds serve a wide range of functions in plants from pigmentation and uv protection to the regulation of hormone transport . flavonoids also have interesting pharmacological activities in animals that are increasingly being characterized in _METHOD_ of effects on specific proteins or other macromolecules . although flavonoids are found in many different locations both inside and outside the cell biosynthesis has long been believed to take place exclusively in the cytoplasm . recent reports from a number of different plant species have documented the presence of flavonoids in _LOCATION_ raising the possibility of novel _METHOD_ of action for these compounds . here we present evidence that not only flavonoids but also at least two of the biosynthetic enzymes are located in the _LOCATION_ in several cell types in arabidopsis . this is the first indication that differential targeting of the biosynthetic machinery may be used to regulate the deposition of plant secondary products at diverse sites of action within the cell .
localization of flavonoid end number of _METHOD_ microscopy studies have provided evidence for the accumulation of flavonoids in the _LOCATION_ of diverse plant species including arabidopsis . to confirm these findings in arabidopsis seedlings under the growth conditions used in our laboratory intact day old la _LOCATION_ plants were stained with the flavonoid specific dye _PROTEIN_ which displays an emission intensity orders of magnitude greater when bound to flavonols or dihydroflavonols than to other flavonoids . optical sectioning by _PROTEIN_ revealed intense staining in the elongation zone and root tip of wild type seedlings as previously reported and detected only _METHOD_ in seedlings which carry a mutation in the second enzyme of the flavonoid pathway . optical sections through _PROTEIN_ stained wild type epidermal and cortex cells showed _METHOD_ emanating from _LOCATION_ throughout the elongation zone and root tip . fig . illustrates at higher magnification _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in _LOCATION_ as well as cell walls and/or _LOCATION_ and intracellular _LOCATION_ similar to previous reports . no obvious _LOCATION_ specific _METHOD_ was observed in the hypocotyl/root transition zone although this is likely to be masked by the high levels of endogenous _METHOD_ in this region . it is not possible to distinguish _METHOD_ from kaempferol versus quercetin using _PROTEIN_ however it was previously shown that there is a higher kaempferol/quercetin ratio in the elongation zone and root tip as compared with the hypocotyl/root transition zone . _PROTEIN_ staining in the absence of triton x yielded similar but less intense results and no _METHOD_ was detected in this region in seedlings when imaged with the parameters used to acquire fig . . it should also be noted that the optical _PROTEIN_ of the images shown in fig . is well below the diameter of _LOCATION_ in these cells thus the _METHOD_ is clearly intranuclear not perinuclear . immunolocalization of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in root determine whether a link could be established between the _LOCATION_ localization of flavonoid end products and the distribution of the flavonoid biosynthetic machinery co immunolocalization of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ was performed . these enzymes catalyze the first and second committed reactions in the flavonoid pathway respectively . _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ with affinity purified rabbit anti _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ anti _PROTEIN_ preparations showed co localization of these enzymes within _LOCATION_ of epidermal and cortex cells of the wild type root tip as well as in the cytoplasm as previously reported . as with _PROTEIN_ staining the _METHOD_ emanated from within the _LOCATION_ and not from perinuclear _LOCATION_ . these signals were highly specific for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ because no _METHOD_ was detected in _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ mutants immunolabeled with anti _PROTEIN_ or anti _PROTEIN_ antibodies respectively . the signals were also not due to bleed through from the dapi channel because no _METHOD_ was detected in the fluorescein isothiocyanate or rhodamine channels for the _LOCATION_ of control samples . wild type seedlings co labeled with antibodies against _PROTEIN_ and the _LOCATION_ resident protein bip _PROTEIN_ showed that unlike _PROTEIN_ bip is excluded from elongation zone _LOCATION_ and exhibits a subcellular distribution consistent with _LOCATION_ localization . together these results point to specific localization not only of flavonoid end products but also of at least part of the biosynthetic machinery to _LOCATION_ of root tip epidermal and cortex cells . to examine this phenomenon at higher resolution immunotransmission electron microscopy was performed . employing an indirect immunogold detection methodology _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were again found to co localize within _LOCATION_ of root tip cells . although some of the cellular ultrastructure was sacrificed to favor epitope preservation it is still possible to detect concentric sheets of perinuclear _LOCATION_ as well as the grainy electron dense _LOCATION_ . consistent with the _METHOD_ experiments labeling for both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ was observed throughout the cytoplasm and also within the _LOCATION_ and at perinuclear _LOCATION_ . once again and mutants failed to exhibit any labeling with affinity purified anti _PROTEIN_ or anti _PROTEIN_ antibodies respectively and no labeling was observed in other organelles such as mitochondria . in vivo localization of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ examine the subcellular distribution of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in living seedlings transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ these enzymes fused to the n or c terminus of _METHOD_ were produced . plants harboring a control construct _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ alone displayed _METHOD_ primarily in the cytoplasm of epidermal and cortex cells in the elongation zone and root tip . in contrast fusion of _PROTEIN_ to the c terminus of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ resulted in accumulation of high levels of _METHOD_ _METHOD_ in the _LOCATION_ in several independent lines . this was also observed in the epidermal cells of the cotyledon in which localization to the both the _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ were clearly visible . similar results were observed with a construct in which _PROTEIN_ was fused to the n terminus of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and for lines _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ although _METHOD_ was less intense . the combined size of _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ is kda larger than what is believed to pass the _LOCATION_ pore complex by passive diffusion whereas for _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ it is even larger . therefore this experiment provides further evidence that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are actively sequestered in _LOCATION_ of the root tip and elongation zone cells . detection of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in isolated _LOCATION_ a biochemical complement to the _METHOD_ microscopy data we enriched for _LOCATION_ from macerated seedlings and assessed the presence of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ by immunoblot analysis . although high levels of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ protein were found in the crude cellular lysate a substantial proportion of each enzyme co purified with the enriched _LOCATION_ fraction . the _LOCATION_ marker protein histone was detected exclusively in the _LOCATION_ enriched fraction whereas the _LOCATION_ marker tubulin showed only a very small proportion co fractionating with _LOCATION_ much less than the amount seen for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . tubulin served as a suitable soluble _LOCATION_ protein marker for these experiments because most of the steps in the _LOCATION_ enrichment protocol were on ice or at conditions that depolymerize microtubules into tubulin monomers . additionally the centriole is comprised _PROTEIN_ of tubulin which is not immunoreactive with the monoclonal tubulin antibody used in this study . it is unlikely that the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in the _LOCATION_ enriched fraction are due to contamination from other organelles or _LOCATION_ fragments due to the detergent treatment step employed in these experiments which serves to selectively lyse chloroplasts and mitochondria . it should be noted that this analysis is not quantitative because it is not possible to recover all _LOCATION_ from intact _METHOD_ .
plant landsberg _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ ecotype was used as the wild type in all experiments . seedlings were grown on the surface of agar medium containing murashige and skoog salts and sucrose under continuous white light for days at as described previously . construction of transgenic arabidopsis plants _PROTEIN_ green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ fusion _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ coding regions were amplified using pfu polymerase and primers that added ncoi sites for fusion to the end of _METHOD_ and either bglii _PROTEIN_ or bamhi _PROTEIN_ sites for fusion to the end . the fragments were then inserted into the ncoi or blgii site in . for _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ the resulting _PROTEIN_ cassette consisting of the double enhanced camv promoter tobacco etch virus translational leader _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ coding region and nopaline synthase terminator was then excised using xmai and sali and subcloned into corresponding sites in pbib _PROTEIN_ . the corresponding region was also subcloned from the empty vector into pbib _PROTEIN_ to serve as a control for localization experiments . for the other three fusions constructs in were digested with kpni filled in digested with saci and then cloned into the smai and saci sites in . the five constructs were used to transform agrobacterium tumefaciens strain using a freeze thaw method and then introduced into arabidopsis la _LOCATION_ plants using the floral dip method . for the constructs in pbib _PROTEIN_ selection of transformants was on medium containing murashige skoog salts and kanamycin . for constructs in selection was carried out by spraying soil grown plants at and days with a dilution of glufosinate ammonium concentrate silwet l per the manufacturer 's instructions . immunolocalization flavonoid staining and were as described previously for immunolocalization using affinity purified rabbit anti _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ anti _PROTEIN_ antibody preparations flavonoid staining with diphenylboric acid aminoethyl ester _PROTEIN_ and imaging by electron microscopy or confocal laser scanning microscopy _PROTEIN_ . _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was visualized using a _PROTEIN_ confocal microscope using a numerical aperture c apo water immersion objective lens nm argon laser line and nm band pass filter . _LOCATION_ protein were immersed in liquid nitrogen in a pre _PROTEIN_ ceramic mortar and ground with a pestle to a fine powder . the powder was transferred to a dounce homogenizer containing ml of cold _LOCATION_ isolation buffer protease inhibitor mixture . the suspension was allowed to thaw on ice and then passes with a loose clearance and passes with a tight clearance pestle were performed . the resulting homogenate was centrifuged at g for min at to sediment large cellular debris and then filtered through nitex nylon mesh to remove smaller cell fragments . the homogenate was centrifuged for min at once at g and then two more times at g with the pellet being discarded between each step . this served to remove any large cell wall fragments as well as non lysed cells as determined by light microscopy . _LOCATION_ were pelleted at g for min at . the remaining supernatant was centrifuged at g for min at to produce the lysed cell supernatant. the _LOCATION_ enriched pellet was resuspended in ml of _LOCATION_ isolation buffer . to selectively lyse any remaining chloroplasts or mitochondria triton x was slowly added to a final concentration of . after min of incubation on ice the suspension was centrifuged at g for min at . the resulting pellet was washed by resuspension in ml of _LOCATION_ isolation buffer and centrifuged at g for min at . this produced a _LOCATION_ enriched pellet with a volume of . qualitative purity was gauged by resuspending this pellet in of _LOCATION_ isolation buffer counterstaining with ml diamidino phenylindole dihydrochloride for min on ice and visualizing by differential interference contrast and _METHOD_ light microscopy . immunoblot were prepared for electrophoresis by suspending the _LOCATION_ enriched pellet in of sample buffer _PROTEIN_ or combining of the lysed cell supernatant with sample buffer . the samples were boiled for min centrifuged at g for min and then analyzed by immunoblotting as described previously using affinity purified rabbit anti _PROTEIN_ at a dilution affinity purified _PROTEIN_ anti _PROTEIN_ at a dilution mouse anti histone monoclonal antibody at a dilution or mouse anti tubulin monoclonal and at a and dilution respectively . typical protein concentrations were mg ml for the _LOCATION_ enriched samples and mg ml for the lysed cell supernatant as determined using a bradford assay .
