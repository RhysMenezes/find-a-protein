chloroplasts contain lipoprotein particles termed _LOCATION_ . _LOCATION_ are generally believed to have little function beyond lipid storage . here we report on the identification of plastoglobule proteins using _METHOD_ _METHOD_ methods in arabidopsis thaliana . we demonstrate specific plastoglobule association of members of the _LOCATION_ lipid associated proteins/fibrillin family as well as known metabolic enzymes including the tocopherol cyclase _PROTEIN_ a key enzyme of tocopherol synthesis . moreover comparative analysis of chloroplast _LOCATION_ fractions shows that _LOCATION_ are a site of vitamin e accumulation in chloroplasts . thus in addition to their lipid storage function we propose that _LOCATION_ are metabolically active taking part in tocopherol synthesis and likely other pathways .
characterization of an arabidopsis plastoglobule marker we have previously identified _PROTEIN_ as a major protein associated with _LOCATION_ in pea . in arabidopsis proteins share sequence similarity with pea _PROTEIN_ constituting the family of _PROTEIN_ proteins as described by laizet et al . . because _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ have already been defined by the international arabidopsis community as standing for phosphatidic acid phosphatase and fibrillarin respectively we propose to abbreviate arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ as plastoglobulin . to obtain a marker for arabidopsis _LOCATION_ we produced affinity purified antibodies against a recombinant arabidopsis protein highly similar to pea _PROTEIN_ . in a total protein extract of arabidopsis leaves the anti antibodies recognized a single band of the expected _METHOD_ . immunogold electron microscopy was used to localize in week old arabidopsis cotyledons . labeling was restricted to chloroplasts . gold particles were detected at the periphery of negatively stained _LOCATION_ but were absent from _LOCATION_ or envelope _LOCATION_ . no labeling was found in control experiments where affinity purified anti antibody was omitted . the data indicate that is associated with _LOCATION_ . the anti antibody gave dot like _METHOD_ in _METHOD_ experiments using fixed protoplasts . the _METHOD_ dots are consistent with the _METHOD_ labeling of _LOCATION_ . control antibodies against _PROTEIN_ and cab resulted in rim like _METHOD_ at the envelope or _METHOD_ at the _LOCATION_ respectively . isolation of a. thaliana _LOCATION_ have previously described the isolation by flotation centrifugation of _LOCATION_ from pea chloroplasts . here we _PROTEIN_ the method to isolate _LOCATION_ from arabidopsis chloroplasts . total _LOCATION_ of isolated chloroplasts were separated from stromal proteins by centrifugation at g. to separate _LOCATION_ from chloroplast _LOCATION_ the _LOCATION_ pellet was resuspended in a sucrose solution and overlaid with a sucrose step gradient consisting of and sucrose solutions and centrifuged overnight at g. this resulted in an apparent separation of _LOCATION_ fractions corresponding to broad and partially overlapping peaks of marker proteins in western blotting analysis . antibodies against the cab protein gave strong signals in fractions indicating the presence of _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ in the high density and sucrose steps . weaker cab signals in fractions were most likely due to a minor presence of highly abundant _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . the rubisco large subunit was detected in the stromal fraction and more weakly in fractions indicating the absence of stromal contamination in the lower density fractions . a protein of the outer envelope _LOCATION_ was detected in fractions . similarly the inner envelope _LOCATION_ protein _PROTEIN_ was detected in fractions . the lower density fractions contained no detectable envelope _LOCATION_ . the sucrose density of fractions is consistent with the presence of envelope _LOCATION_ . was present mostly in fractions separated from the cab _PROTEIN_ and peak fractions indicating the isolation of _LOCATION_ . moreover the sucrose density of fractions as well as the creamy turbid appearance of fractions at the top of the gradient are consistent with _LOCATION_ . notably separate peaks of the plastoglobule marker protein in fractions and suggest the existence of plastoglobule populations of different densities as previously reported . _METHOD_ spectrometric identification of plastoglobule candidate identify proteins associated with _LOCATION_ the low density fraction was separated by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and subjected to in gel trypsin digestion . tryptic peptides were extracted and analyzed by tandem _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . the results of two replicate experiments are presented in table . protein identification was accepted if two different peptides exceeded an xcorr value of and a dcn value of . only under this condition were the peptides counted giving a total of peptides for each identified protein . proteins were identified of which are _LOCATION_ encoded . all but two of the proteins are predicted by the targetp software to have a transit sequence and to be targeted to chloroplasts . the exceptions are two unknown proteins predicted to be mitochondrial . in the first of the two experiments fewer proteins were identified likely due to somewhat less total protein contained in the preparation . proteins were only found in one experiment . of those proteins generally represented by very few peptides were known _LOCATION_ proteins and were therefore not considered to be plastoglobule components . the large subunit of rubisco however was detected neither by _METHOD_ nor by immunoblot analysis suggesting that the plastoglobule preparations were free of stroma . fourteen proteins were present in both preparations were not known _LOCATION_ components and were therefore good candidates for plastoglobule proteins . this number of putative arabidopsis plastoglobule proteins is in good agreement with earlier estimations for pea _LOCATION_ and with the number of bands visible on the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ gel . the plastoglobule candidate proteins fell into three categories _PROTEIN_ like proteins chloroplast metabolic enzymes and unclassified proteins . we unequivocally identified of members of the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ family by specific peptides . we found five known proteins involved in chloroplast metabolic pathways two chloroplastic fructose bisphosphate aldolase _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ allene oxide synthase _PROTEIN_ a neoxanthine cleavage protein and _PROTEIN_ . with the exception of the two fructose bisphosphate aldolase _METHOD_ the proteins are involved in pathways of _LOCATION_ lipid metabolism . other identified proteins annotated in the mips data base as unknown. based on sequence similarities with known proteins most these proteins have annotated enzymatic or metabolic functions . interestingly three pairs of homologs were identified that potentially have a role in either prenylquinone synthesis _PROTEIN_ methyl transfer or triacylglycerol synthesis . members of the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ family associate with _LOCATION_ in engineered c terminal _METHOD_ fusion constructs under the control of the constitutive cauliflower mosaic virus s promoter for three different identified _PROTEIN_ to determine their in vivo localization . the constructs were transiently _PROTEIN_ in protoplasts and subsequently analyzed by confocal _METHOD_ microscopy . _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and pssu _METHOD_ _METHOD_ were used as _LOCATION_ mitochondrial and chloroplast stroma markers respectively . to control the integrity of each _METHOD_ fusion protein transformed protoplasts were analyzed by western blotting using an anti _METHOD_ serum . all _METHOD_ fusion proteins had the expected _METHOD_ . the three _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion proteins _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ gave chloroplastic _METHOD_ confirming the chloroplast targeting of these proteins . moreover each of the pgl _METHOD_ fusions gave globular _METHOD_ patterns similar to that observed in anti _METHOD_ suggesting plastoglobule localization . occasionally a small fraction of the _METHOD_ fusion proteins was detected in the stroma or in the _LOCATION_ suggesting incomplete chloroplastic import or assembly into _LOCATION_ . none of the fusion proteins localized to the _LOCATION_ . allene oxide synthase and fructose bisphosphate aldolases associate with _LOCATION_ allene oxide synthase _PROTEIN_ and two fructose bisphosphate aldolase _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ were considered plastoglobule candidate proteins based on the large number of peptides obtained . upon transient _PROTEIN_ in isolated protoplasts _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was present in globular chloroplastic structures suggesting association with _LOCATION_ . the plastoglobule localization was also analyzed by immunoblotting of the fractions from the sucrose gradient using a serum raised against _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ was present in most of the fractions as well as in fractions and highly enriched in _LOCATION_ . the localization of _PROTEIN_ is therefore ambiguous and suggests the protein may associate with most of the chloroplast _LOCATION_ . two _METHOD_ of chloroplast fructose bisphosphate aldolase were identified in the plastoglobule fraction whereas the presence of the third was ambiguous . although earlier work suggested that _PROTEIN_ is either entirely stromal or partially associated with _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ both _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ gave globular _METHOD_ patterns in chloroplasts . moreover when _PROTEIN_ and were co _PROTEIN_ as _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ fusion proteins overlap of the _METHOD_ signals indicated colocalization of the proteins in globular structures . strong _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and somewhat weaker _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was observed in the stroma . these data suggest that both aldolase _METHOD_ partition between the stroma and _LOCATION_ . neither _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ nor _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ appeared to localize to the _LOCATION_ since _METHOD_ _METHOD_ did not overlap with chlorophyll _METHOD_ . localization of tocopherol cyclase _PROTEIN_ in _LOCATION_ detected the tocopherol cyclase in the plastoglobule containing fraction using _METHOD_ _METHOD_ to analyze the distribution of in chloroplast _LOCATION_ fractions of the sucrose gradient were probed with anti _PROTEIN_ serum . was detected in fractions of the gradient and co distributed with . to obtain additional evidence for the localization of _PROTEIN_ ultrathin sections from week old arabidopsis cotyledons were incubated with anti _PROTEIN_ serum . as shown in fig . _LOCATION_ were decorated with gold particles . however no labeling of _LOCATION_ or envelope _LOCATION_ was observed . furthermore when _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was _PROTEIN_ in protoplasts the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was present in chloroplast globules but none was detected in either the _LOCATION_ or the envelope _LOCATION_ . to determine whether _PROTEIN_ colocalized with _LOCATION_ the two proteins were co _PROTEIN_ as _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ fusion proteins respectively in protoplasts . _METHOD_ as well as _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was present in globular structures inside chloroplasts . both the merge of the independent _METHOD_ images and the pixel intensity analysis showed an overlap of the _METHOD_ indicating co localization of and in _LOCATION_ . taken together the data suggest that _PROTEIN_ is neither a component of the _LOCATION_ nor of the inner envelope _LOCATION_ but is associated with _LOCATION_ . accumulation and enrichment of tocopherols in arabidopsis _LOCATION_ studies have shown the presence of tocopherols in _LOCATION_ of a number of different species but the tocopherol content of arabidopsis _LOCATION_ and the relative abundance in _LOCATION_ fractions has not yet been determined . we therefore determined the contents of tocopherol fatty acids and complex lipids of pooled fractions of the sucrose gradient corresponding to _LOCATION_ in between and envelopes/thylakoid fractions . as previously described _LOCATION_ were found to be rich in nonpolar lipids but contained only low amounts of galactolipids which make up the major fraction of _LOCATION_ and envelope lipids . the molar ratio of tocopherol to total fatty acid was by far the highest in _LOCATION_ . fig . shows that _LOCATION_ contain about molecules of fatty acid per molecule of tocopherol whereas in _LOCATION_ this ratio is increased to fatty acids per molecule of tocopherol . in the different chloroplast fractions tocopherol was by far the most abundant form of tocopherol . this is in good agreement with the finding that tocopherol is the predominant form in arabidopsis leaves . furthermore the amounts of tocopherol in the different chloroplast compartments obtained from the sucrose density gradient were determined . about of the total amount of tocopherol isolated from the sucrose gradient was in the plastoglobule containing fractions . another of total tocopherol was found in fractions which are characterized by the presence of the plastoglobule marker protein as well as traces of outer envelope and _LOCATION_ markers . the data indicate that _LOCATION_ are an important site of vitamin e accumulation in chloroplasts .
