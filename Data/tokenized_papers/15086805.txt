we identified a novel mutation of a _LOCATION_ encoded gene designated as crumpled _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ of arabidopsis thaliana that affects the morphogenesis of all plant organs and division of _LOCATION_ . histological analysis revealed that planes of cell division were distorted in shoot apical _METHOD_ _METHOD_ root tips and embryos in plants that possess the crl mutation . furthermore we observed that differentiation patterns of cortex and endodermis cells in inflorescence _METHOD_ and root endodermis cells were disturbed in the crl mutant . these results suggest that morphological abnormalities observed in the crl mutant were because of aberrant cell division and differentiation . in addition cells of the crl mutant contained a reduced number of enlarged _LOCATION_ indicating that the division of _LOCATION_ was inhibited in the crl . the _PROTEIN_ gene encodes a novel protein with a molecular _METHOD_ of kda that is localized in the _LOCATION_ envelope . the _PROTEIN_ protein is conserved in various plant species including a fern and in cyanobacteria but not in other _METHOD_ . these data suggest that the _PROTEIN_ protein is required for _LOCATION_ division and it also plays an important role in cell differentiation and the regulation of the cell division plane in plants . a possible function of the _PROTEIN_ protein is discussed .
the crl mutant was isolated from a population of transferred dna mutagenized plants of a. thaliana where the line segregated for plants with distorted leaf laminas . in the self pollinated offsprings of these crl heterozygous plants mutant and normal plants segregated to almost ratio indicating that the mutation was inherited as a single recessive trait . the crl mutant plants were pale green had a reduced stature and possessed crumpled laminas and irregular leaf margins compared to wild type plants . _PROTEIN_ and sepals of the crl mutant were also crumpled and had irregular margins . roots of the crl mutant were shorter than those of the wild type . examination of leaf cross sections revealed that leaf lamina of the crl mutant comprised of random sized cells compared to those of the wild type lines . mesophyll cells were also altered in morphology and organization . the inflorescence stem of the crl mutant was thinner and shorter than that of the wild type . histological analysis of the inner structure of the inflorescence stem revealed that cells corresponding to the cortex were abnormally enlarged and reduced in number in the crl mutant . the number of cells corresponding to endodermis and interfascicular fiber cells was also reduced in the crl mutant . the morphology of embryos from self pollinated plants heterozygous for crl and _PROTEIN_ was analyzed because the crl mutant had a substantially reduced fertility . nearly one quarter of the embryos from the heterozygous plants possessed bumpy surfaces . these morphological features were never observed in embryos from self pollinated wild type plants indicating that the abnormal embryos were most likely homozygous for the crl mutations . we investigated the structure of the sam . as shown in figure the sam of wild type was organized in three cell layers and . of these three layers and layers of wild type are composed of a single cell layer as a consequence of a series of anticlinal cell divisions . in contrast to wild type the layers in the crl mutant was disorganized and composed of cells of a relatively random size . oblique division planes were also observed in some cells in the layer of the crl mutant thus giving the layer a discontinuous appearance . this result suggested that the plane of orientation of cell division in the sam was distorted in the crl mutant . we then examined longitudinal sections of root tips to investigate the structure of the crl root . in contrast to wild type oblique and periclinal planes of cell division were observed in some cells of the cortex endodermis and pericycle of the crl mutant which made these cell profiles to appear discontinuous . in addition the arrangement of the columella root cap cells of the crl mutant was disordered . embryos from self pollinated plants heterozygous for crl were analyzed . the first abnormality in the shape of the crl embryo was observed from the two cell stage . although all the zygotes of the wild type underwent vertical division of the embryos from the crl heterozygotes underwent horizontal division . suspensor cells in the crl mutant sometimes underwent periclinal division that were never observed in the wild type embryos . the organization of cells in the embryo proper was also disorganized in the crl mutant . histological analysis described in the preceding sections indicated that the development of some types of cells in the inflorescence stem and embryo could be affected in the crl mutant . to examine whether the differentiation of endodermal cells in the root was altered in the crl mutant we examined the _PROTEIN_ pattern of scarecrow which is fused to the green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ an endodermis specific gene in the root of the crl mutant . as shown in figure the _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in the root of the crl was discontinuous and in some cases was observed in two cell layers . these results show that the differentiation of the endodermal cells in the root is impaired in the crl mutant . mesophyll cells of the crl mutant contained fewer chloroplasts that were extremely enlarged compared to those of the wild type . estimations by microscopy revealed that the mean number of chloroplasts in the crl mutant was per mesophyll cell whereas that in the wild type was . chloroplast sizes were determined by measuring the maximum area of their optical cross sections . the average size of a chloroplast was in the crl and in the wild type . in addition the sds of chloroplast size in the crl mutant fluctuated widely indicating a greater heterogeneity in chloroplast size in the crl mutant compared to that in the wild type . these results suggested that the chloroplasts in the crl mutant were not only enlarged but also divided unevenly . we investigated the size and the number of proplastids in the sam by transmission electron microscopy . as shown in figure proplastids in the sam were enlarged and reduced in number in the crl mutant when compared to wild type indicating that chloroplast division was inhibited at an early stage by the crl mutation . the morphology of mitochondria in the crl mutant was the same as that of the wild type . ultrastructural analysis of the inner _LOCATION_ structures of the enlarged chloroplasts by tem revealed that there were no obvious differences in the organization of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ between wild type and the crl mutant . we also investigated the size and number of _LOCATION_ in cells of root tip and amyloplasts in cotyledons and hypocotyls and this analysis revealed that they were all enlarged and reduced in number . these results suggest that divisions of _LOCATION_ in all organs are inhibited in the crl mutant . photosynthesis in the crl mutant was investigated using pulse amplitude modulated chlorophyll _METHOD_ analysis . the ratio of variable _METHOD_ maximum _METHOD_ was identical between the crl and wild type plants . this result indicated that photosystem ii of the crl mutant was not impaired . the amounts of chlorophylls a and b _PROTEIN_ in the crl mutant by approximately one third compared with the wild type while the chlorophyll a/b ratio of the crl mutant was the same as that for the wild type . these results suggested that photosynthesis efficiency in the crl mutant is reduced whereas the maximum yield of psii photochemistry is not altered . samples were taken from fully expanded leaves of day old plants grown on soil . pigment values represent means of three independent determinations . we cloned a dna region flanking the integration site of the t dna by the plasmid rescue method . the nucleotide sequence of the flanking region revealed that t dna was inserted into a gene of which the mips code is _GENE_ . determination of the integration site of the t dna by pcr revealed that the t dna was inserted around the end of the third exon generating a bp deletion . when the cdna coding region of _GENE_ under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus promoter was introduced into the crl mutant the mutant phenotype was rescued in all the mutants we examined with _PROTEIN_ to gross morphology of the plant leaf morphology chloroplast size and chloroplast number . these results indicated that _GENE_ is the _PROTEIN_ gene . however the cotyledons of rescued plants possessed slightly irregular margins and contained a reduced number of enlarged chloroplasts in some mesophyll cells in cotyledons . the partial complementation can probably be attributed to the _PROTEIN_ of cdna by the camv promoter . the _PROTEIN_ gene was ubiquitously _PROTEIN_ and the _PROTEIN_ was relatively low in roots and mature siliques . no signal was detected in the crl mutant indicating that this mutant is most likely a null allele . the _PROTEIN_ gene encoded a novel protein with a predicted molecular _METHOD_ of . a blast search revealed that there are no other genes significantly similar to the _PROTEIN_ in the genome of a. thaliana . as a distinguishing feature the predicted _PROTEIN_ protein contained only a stretch of hydrophobic amino acid residues that constituted a putative transmembrane domain near its n terminus . comparison of the amino acid sequence of the _PROTEIN_ protein with the genbank database revealed the presence of _PROTEIN_ sequence tags that encode proteins highly homologous to _PROTEIN_ in various species of dicots and monocots and also in a fern but not in yeast and animals . putative genes that encode proteins showing weak similarities to _PROTEIN_ are also present in cyanobacteria . however the _PROTEIN_ protein has no similarity to proteins with predicted or known functions . to determine the subcellular localization of the _PROTEIN_ protein _METHOD_ gene was fused to the or ends of the coding region of the _PROTEIN_ cdna to generate _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ chimeric proteins under the control of the camv promoter . these proteins preserved the function of the _PROTEIN_ protein because these chimeric genes were able to complement the crl mutation . confocal laser scanning microscopy revealed identical patterns of subcellular localization of both _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in wild type plants . the results of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein experiment are shown in figure . in mesophyll cells _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein appeared as a circular and rim like _METHOD_ pattern indicating that _PROTEIN_ is localized at the chloroplast periphery . the _PROTEIN_ protein probably localizes to the envelope _LOCATION_ of the chloroplast . no _METHOD_ because of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was detected within the chloroplasts or other subcellular areas . we fractionated protein extracts from the wild type plants into _LOCATION_ and soluble fractions and subjected these fractions to western blot analysis using an antiserum against _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ protein was only present in the _LOCATION_ fraction . this result ruled out the possibility that some amount of the _PROTEIN_ protein is dispersed in _LOCATION_ or stroma . to determine the localization of the _PROTEIN_ protein within the chloroplast we isolated chloroplasts from the transgenic crl/crl plants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . we then prepared chloroplast homogenates and fractionated the homogenates into soluble and _LOCATION_ fractions . proteins extracted from these fractions were subjected to western blot analysis using an antiserum against _METHOD_ . a protein corresponding to the expected molecular _METHOD_ of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was detected only in the _LOCATION_ fraction indicating that the _PROTEIN_ protein localizes in the envelope or _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . the isolated chloroplasts were then treated with trypsin to digest the proteins outside the inner envelope _LOCATION_ . the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein was susceptible to trypsin while the cpsecy localized in the _LOCATION_ was not . the inner envelope _LOCATION_ protein was also digested . the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein was also susceptible to thermolysin while cpsecy and were not . these results taken together with those of _METHOD_ analysis suggest that the _PROTEIN_ protein is localized in the outer envelope _LOCATION_ of chloroplasts . next the chloroplasts were treated with m nacl or m at ph . _PROTEIN_ protein was not extracted from the _LOCATION_ after nacl or treatment . these results indicate that _PROTEIN_ protein is an integral protein of the outer envelope _LOCATION_ of chloroplasts .
