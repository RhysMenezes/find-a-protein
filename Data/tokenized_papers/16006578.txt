the circadian clock acts as the timekeeping mechanism in photoperiodism . in arabidopsis thaliana a circadian clock controlled flowering pathway comprising the genes _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and flowering locus t _PROTEIN_ promotes flowering specifically under long days . within this pathway _PROTEIN_ regulates circadian _METHOD_ and flowering and acts earlier in the hierarchy than _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ suggesting that _PROTEIN_ might regulate flowering indirectly by affecting the control of circadian _METHOD_ . we studied the relationship between the roles of _PROTEIN_ in flowering and the circadian clock using _PROTEIN_ elongated hypocotyl circadian clock double mutants which are impaired in circadian clock function plants overexpressing _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and gi mutants . these experiments demonstrated that _PROTEIN_ acts between the circadian oscillator and _PROTEIN_ to promote flowering by increasing _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mrna abundance . in addition circadian _METHOD_ in _PROTEIN_ of genes that do not control flowering are altered in _PROTEIN_ and gi mutant plants under continuous light and continuous darkness and the phase of _PROTEIN_ of these genes is changed under diurnal cycles . therefore _PROTEIN_ plays a general role in controlling circadian _METHOD_ and this is different from its effect on the amplitude of _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ functional _PROTEIN_ green _METHOD_ protein is localized to the _LOCATION_ in transgenic arabidopsis plants supporting the idea that _PROTEIN_ regulates flowering in the _LOCATION_ . we propose that the effect of _PROTEIN_ on flowering is not an indirect effect of its role in circadian clock regulation but rather that _PROTEIN_ also acts in the _LOCATION_ to more directly promote the _PROTEIN_ of flowering time genes .
the lhy _PROTEIN_ double mutant is impaired in circadian clock function under free running conditions flowers extremely early under sds and exhibits a shift in the phase of _PROTEIN_ of circadian clock regulated genes under diurnal cycles of light and dark . to test whether the photoperiodic flowering pathway is required for early flowering of lhy _PROTEIN_ mutations that impair the pathway and thereby cause _PROTEIN_ flowering were introduced into the double mutant . the flowering times of the triple mutants gi lhy _PROTEIN_ co lhy _PROTEIN_ and ft lhy _PROTEIN_ were scored under both _PROTEIN_ and sds . under sds the gi lhy _PROTEIN_ triple mutant flowered with a similar number of leaves to the wild type and gi mutant controls and produced > leaves more than the lhy _PROTEIN_ double mutant . by contrast the co lhy _PROTEIN_ and ft lhy _PROTEIN_ triple mutants flowered under sds with only leaves more than lhy _PROTEIN_ double mutants and leaves fewer than the wild type control . the effect of gi on the early flowering phenotype of lhy _PROTEIN_ was also more severe than the effect of co and ft under _PROTEIN_ . with respect to flowering time gi is therefore epistatic to lhy _PROTEIN_ indicating that the extreme early flowering of lhy _PROTEIN_ double mutants is almost completely dependent on _PROTEIN_ activity particularly under sds . genes that act _PROTEIN_ in the photoperiod pathway such as _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are required to a lesser extent for this phenotype . in wild type plants grown under sds the _PROTEIN_ mrna only accumulates during the night and _PROTEIN_ is not _PROTEIN_ under these conditions . a peak in the abundance of _PROTEIN_ mrna at an earlier phase under sds in lhy _PROTEIN_ mutants may in part be responsible for the early flowering of these plants as was shown for _PROTEIN_ mutants . to test whether _PROTEIN_ mrna is _PROTEIN_ at an earlier phase in lhy _PROTEIN_ double mutant plants than in the wild type rna was extracted at intervals of h for h from plants growing under sds of h light and _PROTEIN_ mrna abundance was analyzed by rt pcr . in wild type plants _PROTEIN_ mrna abundance rose to h after dawn and continued into the dark period with high _PROTEIN_ also occurring h after dawn . by contrast _PROTEIN_ mrna abundance rose earlier in lhy _PROTEIN_ plants rising sharply between and h after dawn with a second peak in _PROTEIN_ h after dawn . _PROTEIN_ is proposed to directly activate _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in a light dependent manner therefore whether the altered pattern of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in lhy _PROTEIN_ double mutants correlated with earlier _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ under these conditions was also tested . in the double mutant plants the abundance of _PROTEIN_ mrna rose h after dawn with a strong peak at h that had declined substantially by h. by contrast as expected no _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ was detected in wild type plants under sds . _PROTEIN_ mrna _PROTEIN_ is therefore greatly increased in lhy _PROTEIN_ mutants compared with wild type plants under sds and shows a strong peak at lights off just after the peak in _PROTEIN_ mrna . _PROTEIN_ mrna abundance peaks h after dawn in the lhy _PROTEIN_ double mutants grown under _PROTEIN_ and sds compared with h after dawn in wild type plants . therefore in the double mutant the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ genes are _PROTEIN_ in the temporal sequence _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ as in wild type plants . however in lhy _PROTEIN_ double mutants grown under sds the peaks of _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are shifted earlier and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ occurs soon after _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ at lights off . the temporal order of _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ genes and the strong suppression of the early flowering of lhy _PROTEIN_ plants caused by gi mutations suggested that _PROTEIN_ may be required for the high amplitude phase shifted _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mrnas in the lhy _PROTEIN_ double mutant . therefore the abundance of the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mrnas was followed in the gi lhy _PROTEIN_ triple mutant under sds . the abundance of the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mrnas was reduced dramatically in the triple mutant compared with lhy _PROTEIN_ so that gi suppresses the increase in amplitude in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ observed in lhy _PROTEIN_ . to test whether this reduced _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ was a general feature of circadian clock regulated genes in the gi lhy _PROTEIN_ triple mutant the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ circadian _PROTEIN_ was analyzed in lhy _PROTEIN_ and gi lhy _PROTEIN_ under sds . in wild type plants _PROTEIN_ is circadian clock regulated and its mrna accumulates h after dawn under sds . the phase of _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ was shifted earlier in the lhy _PROTEIN_ double mutant compared with wild type plants but the amplitude of _PROTEIN_ was not reduced in the gi lhy _PROTEIN_ triple mutant . therefore in contrast with its effect on _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ the gi mutation did not alter the amplitude or suppress the phase shift caused by lhy _PROTEIN_ on _PROTEIN_ . in addition to _PROTEIN_ the proposed blue light receptor _PROTEIN_ binding kelch domain f _PROTEIN_ whose mrna abundance is circadian clock regulated with a peak around h after dawn under sds promotes _PROTEIN_ transcription under _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ mrna abundance was tested in lhy _PROTEIN_ and gi lhy _PROTEIN_ plants grown under sds . the peak in abundance of _PROTEIN_ mrna was shifted around h earlier in lhy _PROTEIN_ mutants compared with the wild type . however in gi mutants and in gi lhy _PROTEIN_ plants the pattern of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was similar to that of wild type and lhy _PROTEIN_ plants respectively indicating that _PROTEIN_ does not activate _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ by promoting _PROTEIN_ transcription and that _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ is not sufficient to promote _PROTEIN_ transcription in the absence of _PROTEIN_ . these experiments are consistent with the idea that early flowering of lhy _PROTEIN_ plants under sds is caused by _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ at an earlier phase . _PROTEIN_ in turn induces ectopic _PROTEIN_ of the photoperiod pathway so that _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ during the light phase resulting in higher _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and early flowering . analysis of lhy _PROTEIN_ double mutants suggested that _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ early during the light phase caused early flowering under sds by activation of _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . however many circadian clock regulated genes are _PROTEIN_ at an earlier phase in plants impaired in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ function . to assess whether misexpression of _PROTEIN_ was sufficient to induce early flowering a fusion of _PROTEIN_ to the viral cauliflower mosaic virus promoter was constructed and introduced into both gi mutant and wild type plants . in _PROTEIN_ plants the _PROTEIN_ mrna was present throughout the daily cycle . at each time point _PROTEIN_ mrna was more abundant in _PROTEIN_ than in wild type plants . transgenic wild type plants or gi mutants carrying _PROTEIN_ flowered earlier than control wild type plants . this difference was most pronounced under sds where _PROTEIN_ plants flowered with fewer leaves than the wild type . these data indicate that constant overexpression of _PROTEIN_ is sufficient to promote early flowering even under noninductive sd conditions . in addition to the lhy _PROTEIN_ double mutant lhy a dominant gain of function allele of _PROTEIN_ was described as impaired in photoperiodic flowering and showed reduced _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ under _PROTEIN_ . flowering time of the lhy mutant was measured under _PROTEIN_ and sds . the mutant appeared almost day neutral flowering _PROTEIN_ than the wild type under _PROTEIN_ and earlier than the wild type under sds . _PROTEIN_ promotes early flowering in the lhy mutant consistent with _PROTEIN_ playing a major role in the promotion of flowering downstream of _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ lhy plants were also earlier flowering than lhy under sds and under these conditions slightly earlier flowering than _PROTEIN_ suggesting that a part of the flowering phenotype of lhy is additive to the effect of _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ flowering gi mutants contain lower levels of _PROTEIN_ mrna suggesting that early flowering _PROTEIN_ plants might show increased _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ mrna that in turn caused increased abundance of _PROTEIN_ mrna . the effect of _PROTEIN_ on the abundance of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mrna was therefore measured in _PROTEIN_ plants grown under sds . _PROTEIN_ mrna was present at high abundance and h after dawn suggesting that _PROTEIN_ was sufficient to induce _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ under sds where no _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ occurs in wild type plants . similarly _PROTEIN_ mrna abundance was higher in _PROTEIN_ than in wild type plants and this effect was most pronounced early in the day when in wild type plants _PROTEIN_ mrna abundance is at trough levels . previously _PROTEIN_ was proposed to activate the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ mrna . however _PROTEIN_ mrna levels were not affected by _PROTEIN_ indicating that _PROTEIN_ does not regulate _PROTEIN_ mrna abundance through the regulation of _PROTEIN_ mrna . these data suggest that constant overexpression of _PROTEIN_ from the cauliflower mosaic virus promoter leads to increased _PROTEIN_ mrna _PROTEIN_ during the photoperiod in sds and that _PROTEIN_ then activates _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ to test whether _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are required for early flowering of _PROTEIN_ plants mutations in these genes were introduced into the _PROTEIN_ background . the resulting lines were scored for flowering time under _PROTEIN_ and sds . under both day lengths the co _PROTEIN_ and ft _PROTEIN_ plants flowered at a time intermediate between the original mutant and _PROTEIN_ . especially under sds the early flowering caused by _PROTEIN_ was still apparent in the mutant lines which flowered significantly earlier than wild type plants . this suggests that the extreme early flowering of _PROTEIN_ under sds requires functional _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ genes but that _PROTEIN_ can also promote flowering independently of these genes . _PROTEIN_ plants flower early under sds and show increased abundance of the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mrnas . whether a similar effect is observed on the patterns of _PROTEIN_ of other circadian clock regulated genes was tested in sd grown plants . a _PROTEIN_ luciferase _PROTEIN_ transgene was introduced into _PROTEIN_ and gi backgrounds and five transformants in each genetic background were isolated . luminescence of _PROTEIN_ luc plants showed a strong diurnal rhythm which was followed for h under sds . under these conditions luminescence of _PROTEIN_ luc wild type plants reached peak levels h after dawn whereas luminescence of gi _PROTEIN_ luc and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ luc peaked and h after dawn respectively . similarly the abundance of the _PROTEIN_ mrna appeared to fall to trough levels more slowly in the morning and to rise in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in the evening which is also consistent with a delayed phase of _PROTEIN_ . these experiments indicate that under sds the phase of _PROTEIN_ of circadian clock regulated genes is delayed by _PROTEIN_ and gi . however these effects are much less dramatic than those observed on the amplitude of diurnal _METHOD_ in _PROTEIN_ of mrnas of the flowering time genes _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and do not correlate with flowering time because gi and _PROTEIN_ had similar effects on phase under sds but opposite effects on flowering time . mutations in _PROTEIN_ generally shorten free running _METHOD_ in gene _PROTEIN_ under continuous light reduce the amplitude of _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ genes and cause _PROTEIN_ flowering . the early flowering phenotype of _PROTEIN_ mutants can be explained by their short period phenotype . therefore free running _METHOD_ in _PROTEIN_ plants were tested to assess whether alteration of these _METHOD_ might underlie the early flowering phenotype . _PROTEIN_ gi mutant and landsberg _LOCATION_ plants carrying the _PROTEIN_ luc transgene were entrained to _PROTEIN_ cycles of h h dark and shifted to ll and their luminescence was measured for h . almost all plants of each genotype were rhythmic throughout the experiment although the _METHOD_ dampened more rapidly in gi and _PROTEIN_ than in ler . in _PROTEIN_ the phase of the first peak that occurs after zt h in ll and therefore the peak after the first subjective night was more severely delayed compared with the wild type than under entraining conditions indicating that the phase of the circadian rhythm in _PROTEIN_ luc _PROTEIN_ is delayed in _PROTEIN_ . by contrast in gi mutants the first peak in ll occurred earlier than that of the wild type which is probably due to the shorter period of gi mutants under free running conditions . the period lengths of the _METHOD_ under ll were more variable for gi and _PROTEIN_ but mean period length was shorter for both genotypes . therefore under ll both gi and _PROTEIN_ mutants exhibit a shorter period length than is observed in ler and _PROTEIN_ causes a significant delay in phase . the pattern of _PROTEIN_ of the mrna of _PROTEIN_ was also analyzed at h intervals for h under ll in ler gi and _PROTEIN_ plants . the amplitude of the circadian rhythm in _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ mrna dampened rapidly in gi mutants as previously described making the estimation of circadian period difficult . however in _PROTEIN_ plants _PROTEIN_ mrna showed a robust rhythm and no increase in amplitude was observed despite the reduced amplitude observed in gi . a period length could not be extracted from these data with certainty using fast fourier transform nonlinear least squares _PROTEIN_ . however visual inspection of the pattern of _PROTEIN_ mrna abundance suggested that the effect of _PROTEIN_ on phase was similar to that observed with _PROTEIN_ luc because for example at to h in ll the timing of the peak in _PROTEIN_ mrna was delayed compared with that in ler . taken together these experiments indicate that _PROTEIN_ and gi mutations shorten circadian period and that _PROTEIN_ delays circadian phase as measured accurately for _PROTEIN_ luc but that _PROTEIN_ unlike gi does not influence the amplitude of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . the effect of gi mutations on circadian _METHOD_ may be partly a consequence of impaired light input to the oscillator . to follow the effect of _PROTEIN_ overexpression and of impaired _PROTEIN_ function on circadian _METHOD_ in continuous dark the luminescence of _PROTEIN_ gi and ler plants carrying _PROTEIN_ luc was compared for d in dd after entrainment in _PROTEIN_ . in contrast with wild type plants in gi and _PROTEIN_ plants _METHOD_ were of lower amplitude and the period length of the _METHOD_ varied more widely between individuals . _PROTEIN_ luc appeared arrhythmic in both gi and _PROTEIN_ after the first h in dd . therefore in dd _PROTEIN_ is required to _PROTEIN_ at least a subset of circadian _METHOD_ represented by _PROTEIN_ luc suggesting that the effect of _PROTEIN_ in the circadian system is not only in light input . mutations in _PROTEIN_ were previously shown to impair _PROTEIN_ signaling during seedling deetiolation in red light and because _PROTEIN_ also regulates flowering time and circadian clock entrainment the effects of _PROTEIN_ and lhy _PROTEIN_ on hypocotyl length were compared in a similar way as shown above for flowering time . to test whether the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ is limiting for red light responsiveness the hypocotyls of _PROTEIN_ plants were measured under different intensities of red light . the hypocotyls of _PROTEIN_ plants were shorter in red light than those of wild type plants . the difference was most pronounced at and . these results indicate that _PROTEIN_ plants are hypersensitive to red light and therefore that the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ is limiting on red light responses particularly at high intensities . the early flowering of lhy _PROTEIN_ double mutants may be explained by misexpression of _PROTEIN_ therefore the mechanism of early flowering is closely related to that of _PROTEIN_ plants . previously lhy _PROTEIN_ mutants were shown to have short hypocotyls under high intensity red light . to determine whether this effect requires _PROTEIN_ and to compare the phenotype with that of _PROTEIN_ fluence response curves for hypocotyl elongation of lhy _PROTEIN_ and gi lhy _PROTEIN_ seedlings in red light were made . under these conditions the hypocotyls of lhy _PROTEIN_ plants which in contrast with the previously studied lhy _PROTEIN_ lines are in the ler background were shorter than the wild type at but overall no significant difference in hypocotyl length between ler and lhy _PROTEIN_ was found under red light . the gi mutant exhibited a longer hypocotyl than ler whereas the hypocotyls of gi lhy _PROTEIN_ plants were shorter than gi and slightly longer than lhy _PROTEIN_ . the intermediate phenotype of the triple mutant suggests a complex interaction between gi and lhy _PROTEIN_ in regulating hypocotyl length under red light . hypocotyl lengths were also measured under sds . under this condition the hypocotyls of lhy _PROTEIN_ plants were significantly shorter than those of the wild type . by contrast the gi mutant exhibited a longer hypocotyl than wild type plants . under sds the hypocotyls of gi lhy _PROTEIN_ triple mutants were a similar length to those of lhy _PROTEIN_ mutants . the extreme short hypocotyl phenotype of lhy _PROTEIN_ double mutants under sds does not therefore depend on _PROTEIN_ activity and genes that act _PROTEIN_ in or independent of the photoperiod pathway such as _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are also not required for the shorter hypocotyl phenotype . taken together our analysis indicates that in wild type plants _PROTEIN_ levels are limiting on seedling deetiolation under red light and sds . in addition in contrast with its early flowering phenotype the short hypocotyl phenotype of lhy _PROTEIN_ under sds does not require _PROTEIN_ . the _LOCATION_ location of _PROTEIN_ protein was previously demonstrated using gus _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion proteins in transient assays performed in onion epidermal cells . to test this in arabidopsis and to determine the functionality of the fusion protein _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ transgenes were made and introduced into gi mutants . transgenic plants containing _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ were _PROTEIN_ flowering and not obviously earlier flowering than the gi progenitor . by contrast the gi mutants containing _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ flowered early and at a similar time to _PROTEIN_ plants indicating that the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein was functional and promoted flowering . confocal microscopy was used to analyze the cellular location of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein in the transgenic plants . in epidermal cells of the hypocotyl and leaf stomatal guard cells the fusion protein was only detected in _LOCATION_ . this demonstrates that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ which is functionally active in promoting flowering is localized to the _LOCATION_ strongly suggesting that _PROTEIN_ acts in the _LOCATION_ to control flowering time .
the arabidopsis thaliana ler ecotype was the wild type . the co gi and ft mutants were kindly provided by m. koornneef . the lhy and lhy _PROTEIN_ mutants and _PROTEIN_ transgenic plants were described previously . the _PROTEIN_ luc transgenic plants were generated by introduction of the _PROTEIN_ luc transgene into different genotypes by agrobacterium tumefaciens mediated transformation . the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ transgenic plants in the gi and ler genotypes were generated by agrobacterium mediated transformation of constructs containing the _PROTEIN_ cdna linked to the promoter with or without translational fusions to the _METHOD_ coding region from the vector . two independent transgenic lines _PROTEIN_ a and/or _PROTEIN_ b that were homozygous

_PROTEIN_ tub ctcaagaggttctcagcagta and tcaccttcttcatccgcagtt . numbers of pcr cycles were as follows cycles for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ cycles for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ cycles for _PROTEIN_ and cycles for tub . annealing temperature was for _PROTEIN_ for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ for _PROTEIN_ and tub and for _PROTEIN_ . primer specificity was verified by sequencing the pcr products . the pcr

h. the blot was washed with ssc and _PROTEIN_ for min then ssc and _PROTEIN_ for min at and then the hybridization signal was visualized using the bioimaging analyzer _PROTEIN_ signal intensity was quantified with science lab image gauge software . values were represented relative to the highest value of the samples after standardization to the tub control . all the rt pcr analysis was performed at least twice and usually with independent rna samples . generation plants from independent _PROTEIN_ luc transformant lines were used for the analysis of luminescence and period length . seven day old plants grown on agar in sd and _PROTEIN_ were transferred into agar filled wells of well opaque microtiter plates and treated with mm d luciferin per plant . from the next day the luminescence of individual seedlings was measured by counting in a packard topcount . the average luminescence for each genotype at each time point was calculated from the luminescence normalized for each emitting individual . the period length of free running cycles was estimated from at least h of luminescence measurements starting h after transfer into ll or h into dd using _PROTEIN_ nlls software . in the red light fluence response experiments seeds were placed on gm agar plates without sucrose kept d in the dark at exposed to h of white light then h of darkness and then seedlings were grown either in dd or in _PROTEIN_ cabinets with red _PROTEIN_ light filtered through layers of neutral density filters to obtain different red light intensities . after d the seeds were placed flat on agar plates and their hypocotyl lengths measured with metamorph imaging software _PROTEIN_ . the hypocotyl length of each red light grown seedling was divided by the mean hypocotyl length of the seedlings grown
