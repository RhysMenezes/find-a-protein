root apical meristem and shoot apical meristem are vital for the correct development of the plant . the direction frequency and timing of cell division must be tightly controlled in _METHOD_ . here we isolated new arabidopsis mutants with shorter roots and fasciated _METHOD_ . in the tonsoku mutant disorganized ram and sam formation resulted from the frequent loss of proper alignment of the cell division plane . irregular cell division also occurred in the tsk embryo and the size of cells in _METHOD_ and embryo in tsk mutant was larger than in the wild type . in the enlarged sam of the tsk mutant multiple centers of cells _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were observed . in addition _PROTEIN_ of scarecrow _PROTEIN_ in the quiescent center _PROTEIN_ disappeared in the disorganized ram of tsk mutant . these results suggest that disorganized cell arrangements in the tsk mutants result in disturbed positional information required for the determination of cell identity . the _PROTEIN_ gene was found to encode a protein with amino acids that possesses two types of protein protein interaction motif leucine glycine asparagine repeats and leucine rich repeats . lgn repeats are present in animal proteins involved in asymmetric cell division suggesting the possible involvement of _PROTEIN_ in cytokinesis . on the other hand the localization of the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ fusion protein in _LOCATION_ of tobacco by cells and phenotypic similarity of tsk mutants to other fasciated mutants suggest that the tsk mutation may cause disorganized cell arrangements through defects in genome _PROTEIN_ .
a number of previously isolated arabidopsis mutants with short roots showed defects in the structure of their ram . to identify the key genes involved in the organization and function of the ram we screened for short root mutants of arabidopsis from several different t dna tag line libraries including t dna tag lines from dr k. feldmann 's laboratory and the activation t dna tag lines constructed in our laboratory . among the short root mutants isolated two lines exhibited similar characteristic phenotypes other than short roots . in particular both lines possessed severely fasciated _METHOD_ . genetic analysis of these mutants showed that both the short root and fasciated stem phenotypes resulted from a single recessive mendelian mutation that was tagged by t dna . this mutation was mapped on chromosome between the _PROTEIN_ and markers where no mutation with a similar phenotype has been previously mapped . _PROTEIN_ studies indicated that these mutants were alleles of the same gene and they were designated as tsk and tsk . another allele tsk with a t dna insertion in the _PROTEIN_ gene was identified by pcr screening of the t dna mutant collection from the kazusa dna institute with specific primers for _PROTEIN_ and t dna . the fourth allele tsk was isolated by further screening the t dna activation tag line library from our laboratory . the four tsk mutants possessed similar phenotypes such as short root development even though they were derived from different ecotypes tsk from wassilewskija background and tsk tsk and tsk from columbia background . in most of the following analyses the tsk mutant was used . the primary roots of the tsk mutant were about half the length of the wild type plants . on the other hand the diameter of primary roots and the length of fully elongated root epidermal cells were indistinguishable between the wild type and tsk mutant plants . the root tips of tsk mutants were occasionally split across forming a cleft that is similar in shape to the cloven hoof of a pig . these results suggest that the short root phenotype of tsk mutants is a result of _PROTEIN_ cell division in the root tip because of defects in the structure and function of the ram . the structure of the ram and the development of the primary root of arabidopsis are well characterized . the ram of arabidopsis contains four rarely dividing _PROTEIN_ cells that are surrounded by actively dividing initial cells . each initial cell divides in the same plane and provides new cells to each cell file . the root tips of the wild type and tsk mutants were stained with propidium iodide _PROTEIN_ and were observed by confocal laser scanning microscopy _PROTEIN_ . the root tip of the wild type plants was visible as organized files of cells regular in size and shape where the _PROTEIN_ cells were easily discernible . in contrast the root tip of tsk mutants was visible as a disturbed organization of cells irregular in size and shape where the _PROTEIN_ cells were not easily discernible . irregular planes of cell division that were observed in various cell files seem to explain at least in part the disturbed organization of cells in root tips of tsk mutants . in addition to the irregular cell shape the size of cells in ram of tsk mutant was larger than that of the wild type plant although it might be the result of reduced cell division . irregular planes of cell division were more clearly observed in epidermal cell files . in the wild type plant all cell division planes were organized in a grid like structure . however the tsk mutant showed an oblique cell division plane and occasionally two cell files were assembled into one cell file indicating that irregular cell division frequently occurs in the _METHOD_ of tsk mutants . the root tip of the wild type plant showed four layers of columella root cap cells that accumulated well developed starch granules . these columella cells are generated by asymmetric cell division of columella initials . the root tip of the tsk mutant usually contained a larger number of columella cells that were arranged irregularly or sometimes contained fewer columella cells with less starch granules . it is suggested that tsk mutants are unable to align the cell division plane or are defective in asymmetric division of _PROTEIN_ or initial cells that will eventually affect the number and arrangement of columella cells . the disordered columella root cap layers in tsk mutants suggest the asynchronous division of columella initial cells . the reduced number of starch granules in some tsk mutant plants might originate from a defect in differentiation of columella cells . in arabidopsis roots the _PROTEIN_ gene is _PROTEIN_ in endodermal and _PROTEIN_ cells . tsk mutants were crossed with a transgenic line _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ under the _PROTEIN_ promoter _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and the progenies that segregated for normal and short root length were obtained . in progenies with normal root length _METHOD_ was _PROTEIN_ specifically in a single cell layer of endodermal cells as well as in the cortex/endodermis initials and _PROTEIN_ cells that were continuous to the endodermal layer as reported previously by citation . although _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was also _PROTEIN_ in endodermal cell layers in tsk roots the cell files _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were not continuous in the root tip . unlike the wild type plants the cortex/endodermis initials and _PROTEIN_ cells _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were hardly discernible in the root tip of tsk mutant . the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in tsk mutants often occurred in two cell layers adjacent to each other . in figure the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ appeared to move from one cell file to a more peripheral cell file as indicated by the arrowhead . it is interesting to note that abnormal planes of cell division were often observed in the region where _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ in the cell file was disrupted . the disorganized cell arrangement at the dividing zone of roots of tsk mutants might disturb the proper cell cell communication required for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ of gus activity of _PROTEIN_ a _PROTEIN_ specific promoter trap line in roots of the wild type and tsk mutant plants was examined . gus staining in the roots of the wild type plants was observed in a restricted area of the root tip represented by the _PROTEIN_ cells . in contrast gus _PROTEIN_ in the root tips of the tsk mutant occurred within a substantially broader area compared to the wild type plants . the broadened area of gus _PROTEIN_ suggests that a larger number of cells in the root tips of the tsk mutants retain at least a partial _PROTEIN_ identity . the restriction of _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in the root tip of the tsk mutants appeared to coincide with the observed broadened area of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . the tsk mutants showed fasciated _METHOD_ and the cross section of stem of the wild type and tsk mutant plants suggested that the fasciated stem of tsk mutant was composed of fused _METHOD_ . spiral _PROTEIN_ of leaves with an angle of about in the wild type plants was often disordered in tsk mutant plants . moreover rosettes of tsk mutants often developed from more than one center . the tsk mutants developed flowers with a reduced number of organs and siliques with fewer fertilized seeds compared with those of the wild type plants . the clv and fas mutants with fasciated stem contain expanded sam . the structure of sam of the wild type and tsk mutant plants was examined by scanning electron microscopy _PROTEIN_ . in contrast to a dome shaped sam in the wild type plant the sam of the tsk mutant was flat and irregular in shape . in addition the sam of the tsk mutant often possessed a stack of ectopic layer of cells or a cluster of ectopic cells . in the wild type arabidopsis the epidermal cells divide anticlinally resulting in the formation of a layer of cells . the presence of abnormal cells on the surface of the sam in the tsk mutant could be because of the periclinal division or abnormal expansion of cells in the layer of the sam . phenotypes of aerial parts of tsk mutants such as fasciated stem and altered _PROTEIN_ are likely to be linked with the altered structure and function of the sam . a number of genes play important roles in the organization of the sam . a mutation in these genes may alter the structure of the sam and affect subsequent shoot development . _PROTEIN_ patterns of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ as well as _PROTEIN_ genes in the sam of tsk mutants were compared with those of the wild type plants by in situ hybridization . in contrast to the typical dome shaped sam of the wild type plants which showed clear layers of cells regular in size and shape the sam of tsk mutant plants were flat and in many cases larger than those of the wild type plants . many cells in the sam of the tsk mutant plants were larger in size and irregular in shape compared to those in the wild type sam and ordered layers of cells were hardly discernible . these results strongly suggest that the sam of the tsk mutant is defective in the control of regular arrangement of cells . a thin section of the sam of the tsk mutant occasionally possessed a stack of cells on the surface which probably correspond to the ectopic cells observed in _PROTEIN_ images . the _PROTEIN_ gene is required for specification of pluripotent stem cells and is _PROTEIN_ in a small region composed of a few cells in the center of the sam . the sam of the tsk mutants often exhibited multiple centers of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . in the sam of previously described mutants with fasciated _METHOD_ such as clv and fas broadened _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ was reported . however each region _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in the tsk mutant remained restricted to a few cells although the regions were larger and the cells were arranged irregularly compared to the wild type . to our knowledge multiple sites of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in the sam have not been previously described and this observation appears to be characteristic of the tsk mutants . this split _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ suggests that enlarged sam of the tsk mutant contains several functional centers . _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ in outer cell layers neighboring the sites of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and is suggested to negatively regulate _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . the altered _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ indicates that _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ might also be affected in the sam of the tsk mutant . compared with the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in the sam of the wild type plants the region of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in the sam of the tsk mutants was restricted to a narrower area near the layer . this result appears to support the notion that there are multiple sites of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . it is possible that a negative feedback loop between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ persists in the tsk mutants and that reduced _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ might contribute to the fasciated _METHOD_ of tsk mutants through enhanced _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ gene is _PROTEIN_ in the sam between two leaf primordia and is required to suppress cell differentiation before new cells are incorporated into developing organs . in the sam of the tsk mutant _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ was also detected in a broad region between two leaf primordia suggesting that cells in the sam of tsk mutants are kept in an undifferentiated state . during embryogenesis the direction of cell division is strictly programmed at each cell division . as tsk mutants exhibited an irregular cell division plane at their root tips and elsewhere we examined the structure of the embryos of the tsk mutants . in contrast to the well characterized embryos of the wild type plants many types of abnormal embryos were often observed in the tsk mutant . in the early globular stage embryo of the wild type the inner cells divide parallel to the apical basal axis . however a plane of horizontal cell division was observed at the corresponding position in the tsk embryo . some of the tsk embryos at the early globular stage judging from their size showed highly disorganized cell alignment . many heart stage embryos of the tsk mutant had an asymmetric or misshaped appearance compared to the symmetric embryo of wild type . cells in the tsk embryos seemed to be larger than those in the wild type embryos which is in accordance with the observation in sam and ram of the tsk mutants . these results indicate that abnormal cell division of the tsk mutants occurs from the early stage of embryogenesis . genetic analysis indicated that the tsk locus was linked to t dna . the genomic sequence flanking the t dna of the tsk mutant was isolated by plasmid rescue . determination of the nucleotide sequence of the t dna flanking region indicated that t dna was inserted within the predicted gene _GENE_ on chromosome which is located within a region predicted from the mapping data of tsk . the genomic dna fragment of col spanning the gene _GENE_ was isolated from a clone provided by arabidopsis genome initiative _PROTEIN_ and cloned into a ti binary vector . this genomic fragment contained kbp sequence upstream of the translation start site and kbp sequence downstream of the translation stop site of the gene _GENE_ . transformation of the tsk mutant with this genomic dna fragment complemented the tsk phenotypes . the tsk and tsk mutations were also tagged with t dna and the t dna flanking sequences of these mutants were cloned by inverse pcr . t dnas in these mutants were also inserted within _GENE_ at locations different from the insertion site in the tsk mutant . in addition to these the tsk mutant was identified by pcr screening . from these results we designated the gene at this location as _PROTEIN_ . an extremely long transcript was expected for _PROTEIN_ from _PROTEIN_ prediction and although a partial est of _PROTEIN_ was present in the database we could not detect the _PROTEIN_ transcript by northern hybridization . rt pcr and and _PROTEIN_ were used to reconstruct a full length cdna for _PROTEIN_ . the nucleotide sequence of the reconstructed _PROTEIN_ cdna was mostly consistent with the predicted structure of _GENE_ in the database except that one exon was missing in _GENE_ and the predicted termini of some introns were incorrect . the _PROTEIN_ gene consisted of exons and the _PROTEIN_ mrna was nucleotides in length . the _PROTEIN_ gene was a single copy gene in arabidopsis genome . the _PROTEIN_ gene encodes a polypeptide with amino acids . although there was no significant overall homology to known proteins the amino acid sequence of _PROTEIN_ contained two previously characterized repeat motifs . one of them was c terminally located leucine rich repeats which are thought to be involved in protein protein interactions in various proteins from many _METHOD_ . lrrs in various proteins are classified into six different types based on their repeat structures . the lrrs identified in many plant proteins such as _PROTEIN_ and _LOCATION_ were classified as plant specific type lrrs . on the other hand the lrrs of _PROTEIN_ are most closely similar to a class of lrrs found in proteins such as and ran _PROTEIN_ activating protein . the n terminal part of _PROTEIN_ protein contains four repeats each comprised of amino acids . the amino acid sequence of these repeats was similar to the repeated motifs of leucine glycine asparagine repeats that were first identified in human lgn protein interacting with protein . lgn repeats are also present in _PROTEIN_ of inscuteable _PROTEIN_ of drosophilla melanogaster involved in asymmetric cell division and in several other animal proteins in the database . lgn repeats are similar to the tetratricopeptide motif which is found in a variety of proteins and lgn repeats can be classified as a subfamily of the tpr motif . one typical unit of lgn repeats in animal proteins is composed of amino acids and it contains a characteristic three amino acid sequence highly conserved in all repeats . although this lgn sequence was not perfectly conserved among repeats in _PROTEIN_ other residues conserved among animal lgn repeats were also found in _PROTEIN_ . in contrast to animal lgn proteins that contain seven lgn repeats _PROTEIN_ contained only four lgn repeats . recently involvement of lgn repeats of _PROTEIN_ in protein protein interaction has been reported . it is possible that the large molecule of _PROTEIN_ interacts with many proteins through lrrs and lgn repeats and _METHOD_ a large protein complex . to analyze the _PROTEIN_ pattern of _PROTEIN_ kbp long promoter sequence of _PROTEIN_ gene was fused to a gus coding sequence and this fusion gene was introduced into arabidopsis . histochemical staining of gus activities in plants of transgenic lines showed that reporter gene _PROTEIN_ was detectable in the shoot apex and root tips in day old seedlings . at the shoot apex gus activity was detected in young leaves and in broad areas between two cotyledons where _PROTEIN_ was not restricted to a specific region of the sam . although the vascular tissue near the sam also displayed gus activity vascular tissues in other parts of plants did not show strong activity . in the root weak gus staining extended from the ram to the elongation zone . the preferential _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in the shoot apex than in the leaves and _METHOD_ was also supported by real time rt pcr experiments . the distribution of _PROTEIN_ mrna in the shoot apex was analyzed by in situ hybridization . with the antisense probe for _PROTEIN_ signals were detected throughout the shoot apex including sam and leaf primordia although signals in leaf primordium were weaker than those in the sam . sporadic appearance of signals of _PROTEIN_ mrna in the sam suggests the possibility that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is associated with a specific phase of the cell cycle . the cellular localization of _PROTEIN_ protein was examined by _PROTEIN_ of _METHOD_ fusion proteins of _PROTEIN_ in tobacco by cells . we constructed fusion genes which encoded for _METHOD_ fused at the c terminus _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or the n terminus _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ under the promoter and these fusion genes were used to transform by cells by agrobacterium mediated transformation . transformed by cell lines _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were selected and observed under _PROTEIN_ . in contrast to _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion proteins were exclusively localized in the _LOCATION_ and were not observed in the cytoplasm .
the tsk mutant was identified among t dna insertion lines generated by dr k. feldmann and colleagues while the tsk and tsk mutants were identified among lines in our t dna activation tagging library . the tsk mutant was identified from the t dna mutant collection of the kazusa dna institute by pcr screening . the pair of primers specific to the forth exon of the _PROTEIN_ gene and the t dna left border sequence were used . for observation of roots plants were grown on minimal medium containing sucrose and agar . for observation of aerial parts plants were grown on _METHOD_ medium containing sucrose and gelrite buffered with mes koh . all plants were grown with continuous light at . propidium iodide staining and imaging of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ were performed as described by citation . for histochemical staining of gus activity plants were fixed in buffer m mannitol and washed in mm phosphate buffer . the samples were stained with bromo chloro indolyl d _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in mm sodium phosphate buffer containing mm potassium ferricyanide and potassium ferrocyanide each . for observation of the sam with _PROTEIN_ plants were fixed with formaldehyde acetic acid and ethanol . the samples were then dehydrated successively each with and ethanol followed by molecular sieve dried ethanol and isoamylacetate . the materials were then critical point dried in liquid _PROTEIN_ and coated with gold and palladium to a nm _PROTEIN_ . the materials were observed under _PROTEIN_ . in situ hybridization was performed as described by citation and citation . the cdna probes for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were kind gifts from drs h. tanaka and y. machida of the graduate school of science nagoya university japan . the _PROTEIN_ cdna was a kind gift from y. watanabe and dr s. ishiguro of the graduate school of science kyoto university japan . as a probe for _PROTEIN_ mrna bp long rt pcr fragment amplified with primers tgctctgaactgactcagaagg and _PROTEIN_ corresponding to part of _PROTEIN_ mrna was cloned into pbluescript . dna isolated from tsk plants was digested with ndei then it was self ligated . the ligated dna was introduced into escherichia coli and amplicilin resistant colonies were recovered . some of the cloned plasmids were sequenced and were found to contain arabidopsis dna sequence . dna isolated from tsk and tsk plants were digested with bglii and hindiii respectively then they were used as template for inverse pcr . the nucleotide sequence of full length _PROTEIN_ cdna was determined by aligning the sequence of overlapping rt pcr products . the rt pcr was performed with primers designed to hybridize to _GENE_ predicted by _PROTEIN_ . to determine the end of _PROTEIN_ cdna _PROTEIN_ was performed with full _PROTEIN_ core set . the fragment containing the end of _PROTEIN_ mrna was cloned by pcr with _PROTEIN_ specific and vector specific primers from a cdna library of arabidopsis . the full length cdna of _PROTEIN_ was cloned into or by cloning technology to produce _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ carrying _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ under the camv promoter respectively . both plasmids and _METHOD_ were introduced into tobacco by cells by agrobacterium mediated transformation . each transformant was stained with _PROTEIN_ and observed under _METHOD_ .
