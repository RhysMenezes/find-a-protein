abscisic acid regulates developmental processes and abiotic stress responses in plants . we recently characterized a new arabidopsis mutant _PROTEIN_ which shows aba hypersensitive regulation of seed germination stomatal closing and _LOCATION_ calcium increases in guard cells . _PROTEIN_ encodes the large subunit of a dimeric arabidopsis mrna cap binding complex and in _PROTEIN_ profiling experiments was shown to affect mrna levels of a subset of genes . here we show that the dimeric _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ subunits are ubiquitously _PROTEIN_ . whole plant growth phenotypes are described and properties of _PROTEIN_ in guard cells are further analyzed . complemented _PROTEIN_ lines _PROTEIN_ a green _METHOD_ protein _PROTEIN_ fusion protein demonstrate that _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ localizes in guard cell _LOCATION_ . stomatal apertures were smaller in _PROTEIN_ compared with wild type when plants were grown at humidity and similar at humidity . correlated with stomatal apertures from plants grown at humidity slow anion channel currents were enhanced and inward potassium channel currents were _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ guard cells compared with wt . gas exchange measurements showed similar primary humidity responses and wt which together with results double mutant analyses suggest shows enhanced sensitivity to endogenous aba . double mutant analyses of the aba hypersensitive signaling mutants _LOCATION_ and _PROTEIN_ showed complex genetic interactions suggesting that _PROTEIN_ and _LOCATION_ do not modulate the same negative regulator in aba signaling . mutations in the rna binding protein _PROTEIN_ showed hypersensitive aba induced stomatal closing whereas _PROTEIN_ did not affect this response . these data provide evidence for the model that the mrna processing proteins _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ function as negative regulators in guard cell aba signaling .
_PROTEIN_ was shown to be _PROTEIN_ in guard cells . northern blot analyses were performed on poly rna extracted from wt roots leaves flowers and _METHOD_ to analyze _PROTEIN_ gene _PROTEIN_ in various organs . as shown in figure _PROTEIN_ transcript was present in all tissues analyzed with high _PROTEIN_ in flowers . the _PROTEIN_ gene encodes the small subunit of the cbc and is required for in vitro binding of _PROTEIN_ to the methyl guanosine cap structure of mrna . _PROTEIN_ showed the same _PROTEIN_ pattern . wt transgenic seedlings _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ reporter gene under the control of the _PROTEIN_ promoter were used to further analyze in which tissues the _PROTEIN_ promoter was active . as expected gus activity was detected in roots and hypocotyls cotyledons and leaves . gus activity was not detected in root or apical _METHOD_ . the _PROTEIN_ promoter was highly active in vascular tissues . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was also observed in the vascular tissues of _PROTEIN_ . in d old seedlings gus activity was often first visually detectable in the hypocotyl however this restricted _PROTEIN_ pattern disappeared in d old seedlings suggesting a developmental control of _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ promoter was active in guard cells . the same patterns of _PROTEIN_ were observed in three independent homozygous lines . _PROTEIN_ is a negative regulator of aba signaling . we further investigated whether aba treatment induces changes in the _PROTEIN_ transcript level . as shown in treatment of wt leaves with aba for h did not transcript levels . in control experiments the transcript level of aba inducible genes was increased in wt plants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . treatments with lower concentrations of aba were also performed and again showed no aba regulation of _PROTEIN_ at the transcript level . the lack of aba regulation of _PROTEIN_ mrna levels was also observed after drought treatment . as positive controls under drought conditions induction of the drought induced gene _PROTEIN_ was observed . considering the _PROTEIN_ pattern of the _PROTEIN_ gene in vegetative tissues several morphological and growth characteristics of _PROTEIN_ and wt plants were plants showed a slightly serrated leaf phenotype that is complemented plants _PROTEIN_ the wt copy of the _PROTEIN_ . interestingly this leaf phenotype was also observed in homozygous _PROTEIN_ double mutants which were indistinguishable from the _PROTEIN_ mutant in leaf morphology . after exposure of seeds to for d month and wt seeds germinated at the same rate in the absence of exogenous aba . under these conditions _PROTEIN_ plants were smaller than wt after weeks of growth and showed a delay in bolting and flowering time after weeks . however _PROTEIN_ wt appeared very similar at maturity . an approximately to d delay was observed in flowering of _PROTEIN_ plants compared with wt . this delay varied among plants showing slightly different genetic penetrance among individual plants . the same number of leaves was observed in _PROTEIN_ and wt plants when they started bolting suggesting that _PROTEIN_ is slowed compared with wt and that _PROTEIN_ is not a _PROTEIN_ flowering mutant that shows an increased leaf number when flowering . to further investigate whether _PROTEIN_ growth was slower compared with wt we followed the shoot and the _PROTEIN_ root 's development in _PROTEIN_ and wt seedlings grown in petri dishes . as shown in figure the appearance and development of the first two leaves were delayed in _PROTEIN_ compared with wt after and d of growth . root length was slightly _PROTEIN_ compared with wt after d of growth although root length was similar after d in both wt and _PROTEIN_ . these data suggested that _PROTEIN_ growth is delayed compared with wt . morphological characteristics of _PROTEIN_ and wt plants were further analyzed and compared at maturity . as summarized in table i the only significant difference observed between _PROTEIN_ and wt was in the length of the _PROTEIN_ stem which was _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ by approximately to . no significant differences were observed in the number of seeds per plant the number of _PROTEIN_ per flower or the number of secondary and _PROTEIN_ branches . these data showed that mutation does not significantly affect important developmental processes during growth and further _METHOD_ the relative dearth of pleiotropic effects of the _PROTEIN_ . morphological characteristics of _PROTEIN_ and wt we showed that _PROTEIN_ together with _PROTEIN_ binds the methyl guanosine cap structure of mrna in vitro and that its disruption leads to abnormal transcript accumulation of a limited number of genes in planta which suggests that _PROTEIN_ has a role in mrna processing . to obtain further insights into _PROTEIN_ function in guard cells we analyzed where the protein was localized . to investigate the subcellular localization of the _PROTEIN_ protein _PROTEIN_ and green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ coding sequences were fused in frame to produce both n and c terminal fusions . _PROTEIN_ plants _PROTEIN_ the n terminal fusion protein _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ showed complementation of the _PROTEIN_ mutant based on seed germination assays with aba and on suppression of the serrated leaf phenotype illustrating that _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was functional . the c terminal fusion protein _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ showed no complementation of the _PROTEIN_ mutant based on aba dependent seed germination analyses and on the persistence of the serrated leaf phenotype . these data suggest that the c terminal domain of _PROTEIN_ is important for _PROTEIN_ function . thus further analyses were performed on the functional _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ lines . the subcellular localization of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ was analyzed in guard cells and epidermal cells . untransformed wt plants as expected showed no _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion protein was _PROTEIN_ found in _LOCATION_ in both wt and _PROTEIN_ plants and a slight _METHOD_ activity was detected in the _LOCATION_ . the same pattern of _PROTEIN_ was observed using the c terminal fusion . in control experiments in which wt plants _PROTEIN_ the _METHOD_ protein fused to the gus protein the _METHOD_ gus fusion protein was detected in the _LOCATION_ . the _LOCATION_ localization of _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and complementation of _PROTEIN_ by this fusion protein support the proposed function of _PROTEIN_ as a subunit of a _LOCATION_ rna cbc . to better understand the function of _PROTEIN_ in guard cell signaling we further investigated guard cell phenotypes in _PROTEIN_ . when stomatal apertures were measured in leaves harvested directly from plants grown under low humidity stomatal apertures of _PROTEIN_ were smaller than those of wt plants . wt stomatal apertures were restored in three homozygous _PROTEIN_ lines transformed with gene . in contrast for plants exposed to humidity stomatal apertures in _PROTEIN_ wt were similar _PROTEIN_ . the smaller stomatal apertures observed plants exposed to humidity possibly resulted either from hypersensitivity to endogenous aba or showed an altered response to low humidity . to distinguish between these two possibilities we investigated the humidity response of _PROTEIN_ plants by comparing stomatal conductances of wt and _PROTEIN_ at various humidities using an infrared gas analyzer . gas exchange in _PROTEIN_ plants at humidity was slightly reduced compared with wt consistent with stomatal aperture measurements . stomata closed upon introduction of lower humidity as did wt stomata . the rapid response in gas exchange experiments to step changes in humidity was previously shown to be independent of aba signaling in arabidopsis . indistinguishable gas exchange responses to step changes in humidity in _PROTEIN_ and wt suggest that _PROTEIN_ does not directly modulate the rapid primary humidity response . we also observed that stomatal apertures of _PROTEIN_ were generally larger than those of wt plants _LOCATION_ when no aba was added including plants grown at humidity _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ does not affect the stomatal response to humidity . these findings are consistent with the hypothesis that reduced stomatal apertures in _PROTEIN_ at low humidity are because of signaling mediated by endogenous aba . aba induces _LOCATION_ increases which in turn activate slow anion channels and inhibit k in channels in guard cells . the activities of guard cell slow anion channels and k in channels were investigated in _PROTEIN_ and wt grown at humidity which causes reduced stomatal apertures in _PROTEIN_ . patch clamp experiments performed on guard cell protoplasts from plants grown under low humidity showed that in _PROTEIN_ guard cells anion currents were consistently larger than those in the wt guard cells . furthermore anion currents showed reduction to wt magnitudes in a complemented line . control experiments were performed on the aba hypersensitive mutant _LOCATION_ . in _LOCATION_ no constitutive activation of guard cell anion channels was observed in the absence of exogenous aba confirming previous findings . these data show a difference in slow anion channel regulation in the absence of exogenous aba in _PROTEIN_ and _LOCATION_ indicating different functions of these two negative regulators of aba signaling . k in channel currents were substantially smaller in _PROTEIN_ guard cells than in wt guard cells from plants grown at humidity without addition of exogenous aba . k in currents showed recovery of wt magnitudes in a complemented line . furthermore when plants were exposed to high humidity for d k in channel current magnitudes in _PROTEIN_ guard cells were significantly larger than those in _PROTEIN_ guard cells from humidity grown plants . k in channel currents guard cells grown at showed recovery but remained slightly smaller than the current magnitudes of wt grown at humidity . anion channel and k in channel activities recorded in _PROTEIN_ guard cells isolated from plants grown at humidity correlated with the reduced stomatal apertures and reduced gas exchange found in _PROTEIN_ leaves . to further investigate genetic interactions of _PROTEIN_ previously characterized early aba signaling mutants stomatal responses in homozygous _PROTEIN_ double mutants were analyzed . in double mutant stomatal closure in response to aba was similar to the response in _PROTEIN_ alone when plants were treated overnight at high humidity . however stomatal apertures of plants grown at humidity were similar in _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ and similar to wt . the complex interaction of _PROTEIN_ and _LOCATION_ was also observed for non guard cell phenotypes . for example the increased number of _PROTEIN_ described in _LOCATION_ compared with wt was also observed in the _PROTEIN_ mutant whereas the _PROTEIN_ serrated leaf phenotype was unchanged in _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ . however the delay in growth was increased compared with both _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ suggesting additive affects in this response . the ability to produce siliques and seeds was strongly reduced in _PROTEIN_ . all these data stress the complexity by which _PROTEIN_ interact in planta suggesting that they may target distinct processes in the aba signaling network that have differential relative importance in different tissues and depending on conditions . furthermore _LOCATION_ is known to have pleiotropic phenotypes because it is the only farnesyl transferase subunit gene in arabidopsis therefore many _LOCATION_ phenotypes would be expected not to show an interaction with _PROTEIN_ . _LOCATION_ associated _METHOD_ that are considered not to be linked to aba signaling include the wiggum flower development phenotype and farnesylation of the _PROTEIN_ transcription _PROTEIN_ . stomatal apertures in response to aba were also investigated in double mutant . as shown in aba did not cause significant stomatal closure in the _PROTEIN_ mutant but induced stomatal closing in the wt . at aba however stomata closed in double mutants whereas they remained widely opened in _PROTEIN_ . these data showed that aba induced stomatal closing in the _PROTEIN_ double mutant is more aba sensitive than in the _PROTEIN_ background . these data correlate with an intermediate aba sensitivity of double mutant in seed germination that lies between the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ sensitivities . however because _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants are in the columbia and ler backgrounds respectively we have also isolated a control line that carries the _PROTEIN_ mutation in an _LOCATION_ wt background from seeds resulting from _PROTEIN_ crosses . the control line and its progeny showed a strong insensitivity to . transgenic _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in tobacco confers strong insensitivity to aba confirming that the dominant _PROTEIN_ mutant protein functions in many backgrounds . the _PROTEIN_ mutation partially suppresses this dominant _PROTEIN_ phenotype . stomatal apertures of _PROTEIN_ plants measured directly from plants grown at humidity were generally larger than those of wt plants . under the same conditions stomatal apertures in the _PROTEIN_ double mutant were similar to _PROTEIN_ . these findings are also consistent with the hypothesis that reduced stomatal apertures at low humidity are because of a response to low levels of endogenous aba as the _PROTEIN_ mutation causes aba insensitivity to low aba concentrations in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . mutations in three rna binding proteins have been described recently that show aba hypersensitivity . in addition to the mrna cap binding protein _PROTEIN_ these genes include a double stranded rna binding protein _PROTEIN_ and a protein with similarity to an sm like snrnp protein _PROTEIN_ . we investigated whether the _PROTEIN_ mutations affect stomatal movements . aba induced stomatal closure in the _PROTEIN_ mutant showed a reproducible aba hypersensitivity compared with the wt ecotype _PROTEIN_ . in contrast in mutant aba induced stomatal closure was similar to the wt ecotype nossen in two independent lines of investigation .
_PROTEIN_ other arabidopsis mutants and the corresponding wt ecotypes were grown side by side in growth chambers humidity h h dark cycle temperature and photon fluency rate of . unless otherwise stated wt plants are from the columbia ecotype . when required the growth of _PROTEIN_ and wt plants was synchronized by sowing _PROTEIN_ plants week earlier than wt . to test the sensitivity of seeds to aba in the case lines complemented with the n terminal _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion seeds were plated on minimal medium containing aba . after d at seeds were transferred to and continuous light and germination was scored after more d. seeds used for comparative studies were from plants grown and harvested in parallel . for seedling growth assays month old _PROTEIN_ and wt seeds were germinated on murashige and skoog plates . germination was scored after d to make sure that all the seedlings were at the two cotyledon stages and the root length was estimated using a micrometer under a dissecting microscope . seeds that showed a delay in germination were removed from the plates in both wt and _PROTEIN_ . after and d of growth root length was measured and the development of the shoot was studied by analyzing the appearance and development of new leaves under the microscope . to generate n and c terminal fusion proteins between _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ proteins the full length _PROTEIN_ cdna was amplified using pfu dna polymerase . primers used for pcr included specific restriction sites at both ends to allow the cloning of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in frame in the vector _METHOD_ . pcr amplified constructs were confirmed by sequencing . agrobacterium tumefaciens strain was used to generate transgenic arabidopsis plants using the floral dip technique . the subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ fused to _METHOD_ was assessed by scanning confocal laser microscopy in epidermal strips prepared as described . epidermal strips were mounted between two cover slips on an axiovert microscope coupled to an mcr scanning laser confocal system . argon laser light was used to excite _METHOD_ and emission light was measured at nm . transmission images were collected in parallel . _METHOD_ was monitored at nm . gus activity was assayed on either seedlings grown on murashige and skoog plates or soil after h of incubation in a solution containing bromo chloro indolyl d _PROTEIN_ k ferrocyanide ferricyanide and triton . experiments were performed on three independent wt _PROTEIN_ gus lines . wt control plants showed no gus activity . total rna was extracted from flowers leaves _METHOD_ and roots of to week old wt plants using trizol reagent . poly rna was further purified using the mrna isolation kit according to the manufacturer 's instructions . to examine whether aba regulates _PROTEIN_ gene _PROTEIN_ total rna and poly rna were extracted from rosette leaves of wt plants sprayed with aba h before extraction . several complementary experiments were carried out using and aba for different application times . total and poly rna were separated in a denaturing agarose gel and then transferred onto a hybond n _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ . the blots were hybridized with cdna and/or a _PROTEIN_ genomic fragment amplified by pcr using the forward and reverse primers cga _PROTEIN_ ggt tga taa gag _PROTEIN_ and act ctc cga cac tgg tac respectively . stomatal aperture measurements were performed as described . stomata from to week old plants were opened by exposing excised leaves for h to white light floating in a stomatal opening solution containing mm kcl and mm mes in the growth chamber at . stomatal apertures were measured h after aba was added . when experiments were performed with _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ double mutants plants were subjected to an overnight high humidity treatment before incubation of the leaves in stomatal opening solution . control experiments were performed in parallel with no aba added . leaves were then blended for s and epidermal peels collected as described . stomatal apertures were measured by focusing on the focal plane of guard cells in epidermal strips . stomatal responses to humidity were determined by measuring transpiration rates using a li infrared gas analyzer _PROTEIN_ . chamber temperature and _PROTEIN_ dioxide concentration were _PROTEIN_ at and respectively . constant illumination of quanta photosynthetically active radiation was provided by a red and blue _PROTEIN_ light source . anion and k currents were recorded from guard cell protoplasts of to week old plants grown either at humidity or after h of high humidity treatment . the solutions used in patch clamp experiments were composed of mm cscl mm egta and mm hepes tris ph in the pipette medium and of mm cscl mm and mm mes tris ph in the bath medium for anion channel activity measurement . for k current measurements the pipette solution was composed of mmkcl mm glu mm mm egta mm mm _PROTEIN_ and mm hepes tris ph . the bath solution contained mm kcl mm and mm mes tris ph . for all solutions osmolarity was adjusted to mmol for bath solutions and mmol for pipette solutions by addition of d sorbitol .
