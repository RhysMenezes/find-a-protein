the arabidopsis genome has two fumarase genes one of which encodes a protein with mitochondrial targeting information _PROTEIN_ while the other _PROTEIN_ does not . we show that a _PROTEIN_ green _METHOD_ protein fusion is directed to mitochondria while _PROTEIN_ red _METHOD_ protein remains in the _LOCATION_ . while mitochondrial _PROTEIN_ is an essential gene _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ is not required for plant growth . however _PROTEIN_ is required for the _METHOD_ accumulation of _PROTEIN_ into fumarate that occurs in arabidopsis leaves during the day . in _PROTEIN_ knock out mutants fumarate levels remain low while malate increases and these changes can be reversed with a _PROTEIN_ transgene . the _PROTEIN_ mutant has lower levels of many amino acids in leaves during the day compared with the wild type but higher levels at night consistent with a link between fumarate and amino acid metabolism . to further test this relationship we grew plants in the absence or presence of nitrogen fertilizer . the amount of fumarate in leaves increased several fold in response to nitrogen in wild type plants but not in _PROTEIN_ . malate increased to a small extent in the wild type but to a greater extent in _PROTEIN_ . growth of _PROTEIN_ plants was similar to that of the wild type in low nitrogen but much slower in the presence of high nitrogen . activities of key enzymes of nitrogen assimilation were similar in both genotypes . we conclude that _PROTEIN_ is required for the accumulation of fumarate in leaves which is in turn required for rapid nitrogen assimilation and growth on high nitrogen .
the arabidopsis genome encodes two fumarases designated _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . the two genes have an identical exon structure and encode two proteins that are identical at the amino acid sequence level throughout the whole length with the exception of the n terminal region . the coding information of exon in each gene differs such that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ encode amino termini of and amino acids with little similarity while the subsequent residues of this exon are identical . this implies that the two genes have arisen recently by gene duplication with formation of a different first exon . this is probably not the result of duplication of a chromosome segment since the genes immediately upstream and downstream of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are different . _PROTEIN_ is predicted to be targeted to the _LOCATION_ and is detected in the mitochondrial proteome by _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . the location of _PROTEIN_ is unclear . to establish the subcellular location of these two enzymes we constructed _PROTEIN_ green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ red _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ fusions in which the n and c terminal sequences of _PROTEIN_ are preserved . the transgenes whose _PROTEIN_ was driven by the promoter were introduced into a. thaliana cell cultures by biolistic bombardment together with plasmids encoding markers for mitochondria _METHOD_ and _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . after transient _PROTEIN_ for h _METHOD_ was visualized by confocal laser microscopy . strong positive correlations showed that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ co localized with the mitochondrial mcherry while _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ co localized with the _LOCATION_ _METHOD_ marker . to provide further confirmation for the distinct subcellular localization of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ arabidopsis stable transformants were created containing both _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgenes . roots of transgenic lines _PROTEIN_ both _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ were examined by _METHOD_ microscopy . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ clearly localized to structures consistent with mitochondria while _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was distributed throughout the cytoplasmic strands of the cell . imaging of living cells showed _METHOD_ in mitochondria like organelles migrating along the _LOCATION_ while _METHOD_ exhibited cytoplasmic streaming . we could see no evidence of _PROTEIN_ in the _LOCATION_ or of _PROTEIN_ in mitochondria although such possibilities can not be excluded . we conclude that in arabidopsis distinct genes encode mitochondrial and _LOCATION_ fumarases unlike yeast and human in which a single gene encodes both _METHOD_ . _PROTEIN_ of these two _PROTEIN_ genes is not readily established from publicly available transcriptome data because they are not identified separately on microarrays . to determine if the _PROTEIN_ gene _PROTEIN_ pattern gives any clues to its possible function we carried out qualitative rt pcr analysis on rna from different tissues . the results show that _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ weakly in seedlings but more strongly in leaves . previous quantitative analysis shows that the level of _PROTEIN_ rna in rosette leaves is higher in the light than in the dark but total fumarase activity remains constant throughout the diurnal cycle . a putative t dna knock out mutant of _PROTEIN_ was characterized . while heterozygous _PROTEIN_ plants could be readily obtained we failed to isolate homozygous _PROTEIN_ knock out plants from self fertilized heterozygotes . we did not investigate if this was due to lethality of gametes or embryo . however we conclude that _PROTEIN_ is an essential enzyme consistent with its role in the tricarboxylic acid cycle . antisense inhibition of mitochondrial fumarase gene _PROTEIN_ in tomato resulted in _PROTEIN_ of fumarase activity of up to so presumably the remaining of enzyme activity was sufficient for plant growth and reproduction . however these transgenic plants had altered photosynthesis and partitioning of resources between roots and shoot . we isolated two independent mutants for _PROTEIN_ both with t dna insertions in exon . both are confirmed as null mutants since no transcript could be detected in either case . we assayed total fumarase activity in extracts of leaves of both _PROTEIN_ mutants and found that it was reduced by approximately relative to the wild type . this implies that _PROTEIN_ accounts for much more activity than _PROTEIN_ in leaves . subsequent results presented in this paper are for _PROTEIN_ but were confirmed by analysis of _PROTEIN_ . seed germination of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants was indistinguishable from that of the wild type . to determine if _PROTEIN_ is required for beta oxidation the glyoxylate cycle or _PROTEIN_ during seedling growth we compared in vitro growth of _PROTEIN_ mutant with the glyoxylate cycle mutant icl . growth of the icl mutant is severely compromised in both light and dark although it can be rescued with sucrose . in contrast _PROTEIN_ seedlings grown in the presence or absence of light or sucrose are indistinguishable from the wild type . root growth of _PROTEIN_ seedlings was also inhibited by dichlorophenoxyacetic acid a beta oxidation dependent inhibitor of growth . these observations demonstrate that _PROTEIN_ is not apparently required for seedling growth and do not support the proposal that _LOCATION_ fumarase plays a key role in lipid metabolism in seedlings . this conclusion is consistent with the observed pattern of _PROTEIN_ gene _PROTEIN_ which is much stronger in leaves than seedlings . the gas chromatography _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ analysis of extracts from seedlings on day after imbibition provides further support for this conclusion showing that the _PROTEIN_ metabolome is different from that of icl . amino acids are present at wild type levels in _PROTEIN_ but are several fold lower in icl . hexoses are low in _PROTEIN_ but even lower in icl whereas organic acids are low in both _PROTEIN_ and icl . wild type and _PROTEIN_ plants were grown in a sand/compost mixture in a h h dark diurnal cycle to growth stage . plant growth was not visibly different in _PROTEIN_ compared with the wild type under these conditions . extracts were prepared from rosette leaves at h intervals and analysed by gc _METHOD_ for organic acid content . as expected in the wild type fumarate and malate both increased several fold during the day and _PROTEIN_ again at night . in the _PROTEIN_ mutant however fumarate was present at a fold lower level and malate at a two fold higher level than in the wild type . nevertheless both increased during the day and _PROTEIN_ at night . to confirm that the observed changes in fumarate and malate are a direct consequence of removal of _PROTEIN_ we transformed _PROTEIN_ with a transgene comprising the promoter linked to _PROTEIN_ cdna . four independent transgenic lines were chosen for further analysis and shown to _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ cdna as rna . fumarase enzyme activity was measured in extracts of leaves from these lines and shown to be increased to between and of wild type activity . fumarate and malate levels were measured in the leaves of these transgenic plants at the end of the day and end of the night . the transgene restored fumarate levels to much above that of _PROTEIN_ and at the same time lowered malate to near wild type levels . in addition a positive linear correlation was observed between fumarase activity and amount of fumarate in the six different genotypes whereas a negative correlation was observed between fumarase activity and amount of malate . therefore we conclude that _PROTEIN_ is responsible for the accumulation of fumarate from malate in leaves . however the diurnal regulation is only partially restored by the transgene and varies between different transgenic lines . for example lines and show normal diurnal regulation while lines _PROTEIN_ and do not . we do not know the reason for this but assume that transgene _PROTEIN_ does not faithfully replicate _PROTEIN_ of the endogenous _PROTEIN_ gene . we see variable levels of rna _PROTEIN_ and enzyme activity in the four lines . the demonstration that _PROTEIN_ is required for the _METHOD_ accumulation of fumarate and the implication that this fumarate is synthesized from malate led us to examine the relative contents of some other organic acids and amino acids . these were determined by gc _METHOD_ analysis of extracts of leaves at the end of the light period and end of the dark in _PROTEIN_ and the wild type . the results show that several amino acids are significantly lower in _PROTEIN_ than in the wild type in the light but in the dark they are higher in _PROTEIN_ . this trend is particularly apparent for glutamine . in contrast succinate and citrate are significantly higher in _PROTEIN_ in the light but are no different in the dark . thus there appears to be a shift from amino acids to organic acids in the _PROTEIN_ mutant in the light consistent with the hypothesis that fumarate accumulation in the light is linked to nitrogen assimilation . wt wild type . p < . since citation reported that much more fumarate accumulates in the starchless _PROTEIN_ mutant we considered the possibility that with impaired fumarate accumulation in _PROTEIN_ more _PROTEIN_ may be sequestered into starch . iodine staining and quantification of starch extracted from leaves at the end of the day and end of the night shows that leaves of _PROTEIN_ accumulate twice as much starch as the wild type . this result together with that of citation implies that fumarate and starch serve as alternative and potentially flexible _PROTEIN_ sinks for photosynthate . it should be noted however that _PROTEIN_ plants do not synthesize and break down more starch than the wild type during day and night . instead they probably accumulate a small amount of additional starch during each diurnal cycle such that over a period of many cycles a starch excess phenotype is observed . this is commonly seen in a range of starch excess mutants . one explanation for these observations could be that _PROTEIN_ mutants are impaired in nitrate assimilation into amino acids and so accumulate some _PROTEIN_ in starch . transgenic lines of _PROTEIN_ containing the _PROTEIN_ transgene still have a starch excess phenotype . this may reflect the _PROTEIN_ that in transgenic lines diurnal regulation of _PROTEIN_ levels is not fully restored to wild type patterns so nitrate assimilation may still be impaired . to further investigate the potential role of _PROTEIN_ and fumarate in nitrogen assimilation we used a soil based experimental setup consisting of a high nitrogen treatment at which rosette growth is maximal and a low nitrogen treatment at which relative growth rate of the rosette is _PROTEIN_ by about thus resulting in a two to threefold _PROTEIN_ in aerial _METHOD_ in plants at the age of days after germination . plants were harvested after days at the end of the day for analysis of fresh weight key metabolites and enzyme activities . as shown previously in plants grown with high nitrogen nitrate content as well as nitrate reductase were strongly increased while total amino acids were _PROTEIN_ . chlorophyll protein content and most enzyme activities did not change under low versus high nitrogen . none of these responses to nitrogen were different in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . however whereas the fumarate content of wild type leaves was increased several fold on high nitrogen that of _PROTEIN_ did not increase . malate was only marginally higher in the wild type in the presence of nitrogen but was relatively much higher in _PROTEIN_ . this observation is consistent with the previous data suggesting that malate accumulates when fumarate synthesis is blocked . strikingly while there was little difference in _METHOD_ between the two genotypes when no nitrogen was added the wild type had twice the fresh weight of _PROTEIN_ plants in the presence of added nitrogen . this result indicates that _PROTEIN_ and by implication fumarate accumulation during the day is required for rapid nitrogen assimilation and plant growth . while total amino acids and protein are similar in amount in _PROTEIN_ and wild type leaves on a fresh weight basis wild type plants have assimilated much more nitrogen since the plants have much greater _METHOD_ . the differences between genotypes in growth and by implication nitrogen assimilation are not explained by differences in nitrate content of leaves or the activities of key enzymes of nitrogen assimilation since these were not significantly different . we conclude that the accumulation of fumarate catalysed by _PROTEIN_ is required for effective assimilation of nitrogen and growth of a. thaliana on high nitrogen .
arabidopsis thaliana seeds were surface sterilized stratified and germinated as previously described . seedlings were grown on half strength _METHOD_ medium with or without sucrose in continuous light at for days before transfer to a mix of compost and sand . this compost mixture provided adequate nutrients for arabidopsis growth but the inorganic nitrogen content was not analysed . plants were then grown at with a h light and h dark photoperiod . for growth with added nitrogen plants were grown as described in citation . thus at days after germination plants were transferred to individual pots containing either mg or mg of inorganic nitrogen . plants were then grown for week in a h day/night cycle and then for weeks in a h day/night cycle at constant relative humidity and a light
