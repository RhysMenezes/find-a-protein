many key aspects of plant development are regulated by the _PROTEIN_ transport of the phytohormone auxin . cellular auxin efflux the rate limiting step in this process has been shown to rely on the coordinated action of _PROTEIN_ formed _PROTEIN_ and b type _PROTEIN_ binding cassette carriers . here we report that _PROTEIN_ auxin transport in the arabidopsis thaliana root also requires the action of a major facilitator superfamily transporter zinc induced facilitator like _PROTEIN_ . sequencing promoter reporter and _METHOD_ protein fusion experiments indicate that the full length _PROTEIN_ protein and a truncated splice isoform _PROTEIN_ localize to the tonoplast of root cells and the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ of leaf stomatal guard cells respectively . using reverse genetics we show that the _PROTEIN_ transporter regulates various root auxin related processes while the _PROTEIN_ isoform mediates drought tolerance by regulating stomatal closure . auxin transport and immunolocalization assays demonstrate that _PROTEIN_ indirectly modulates cellular auxin efflux during shootward auxin transport at the root tip likely by regulating _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ abundance . finally heterologous _PROTEIN_ in yeast revealed that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ share h coupled k transport activity . thus by determining the subcellular and tissue distribution of two _METHOD_ alternative splicing dictates a dual function for the _PROTEIN_ transporter . we propose that this mfs carrier regulates stomatal movements and _PROTEIN_ auxin transport by modulating potassium and proton fluxes in arabidopsis cells .
to initiate the characterization of the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ gene we monitored its organ and tissue specific _PROTEIN_ patterns by means of reporter gene experiments . staining of transgenic lines stably _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ under the control of the _PROTEIN_ promoter revealed that this promoter is active in most plant organs . in flowers _PROTEIN_ appears to be strongly and exclusively _PROTEIN_ in the anther stamen filaments at all stages of floral development . interestingly in young leaves _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was largely restricted to stomata which exhibited a distinct gus coloration . in _PROTEIN_ all green mature plant organs such as _METHOD_ siliques and leaves displayed exclusive staining of stomatal guard cells . in light and dark grown seedlings very intense _PROTEIN_ promoter activity was detected at the shoot apical meristem as well as throughout the root system . although homogenous gus coloration was observed from the hypocotyl root junction through all along the primary root the _PROTEIN_ promoter was particularly active at the root tip . in addition while no staining could be detected in _PROTEIN_ root primordia _PROTEIN_ was abundantly _PROTEIN_ in elongating lrs . we further explored the precise localization of _PROTEIN_ promoter activity in root tissues using transgenic lines _PROTEIN_ the green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ under the control of the _PROTEIN_ promoter . in the mature portion of the pr the _METHOD_ signal was restricted to the cortex and to a lesser extent the epidermis . at the root tip _PROTEIN_ promoter activity was high in both the cortical and epidermal cell layers of the apical meristem and the transition zone while absent from the quiescent center the columella cells or the lr cap . a similar layer specific pattern was observed in lrs with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ appearing _PROTEIN_ restricted to the cortex at an early stage of lr elongation and spreading also to the epidermis particularly at the tip in older lrs . by contrast _PROTEIN_ promoter activity in stomata was insufficient to allow detection of the _METHOD_ signal . taken together these results indicate that _PROTEIN_ may exert a prominent role in roots particularly at the pr and lr tips as well as in stomatal guard cells . according to the current genome annotation the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ gene contains exons and generates three distinct transcripts . the first _PROTEIN_ corresponds to the full length transcript resulting from constitutive splicing of the precursor mrna while the second _PROTEIN_ likely arises from selection of an alternative transcription start site in the second intron . the predicted start codons of these two alternative transcripts are in frame hence their coding sequences are identical downstream of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . finally the _PROTEIN_ splice variant derives from selection of an alternative splice site in the fourteenth intron with the second of two contiguous _PROTEIN_ being recognized . the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ transcripts are therefore identical except for the absence of two nucleotides in _PROTEIN_ that leads to the inclusion of a premature stop codon in the exon in _PROTEIN_ . the _PROTEIN_ transcript is predicted to encode the full size transporter displaying the typical mfs transporter signature motif that includes two transmembrane domains each consisting of six _LOCATION_ spanning segments delimiting a central hydrophilic loop . on the other hand the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ transcripts encode putative transporters that retain the characteristic mfs structure but lack the two first n terminal or the two last c terminal _LOCATION_ spanning segments respectively . in order to verify the accuracy of these predictions and examine the tissue specific distribution of the _PROTEIN_ transcripts we first undertook an rt pcr approach . given that the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ transcripts differ by just two nucleotides only primers concomitantly amplifying both transcripts could be designed while an independent forward primer was used to detect _PROTEIN_ . consistent with the promoter activity profile shown in figure rt pcr analysis revealed that _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ throughout plant development with the _PROTEIN_ mrnas being most abundant in young seedlings and root tissues whereas very low transcript levels were detected in flowers and green tissues . globally the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ patterns were comparable except that the _PROTEIN_ transcripts appeared to be markedly more abundant in senescent leaves and _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ was slightly more pronounced in flowers . intriguingly during this analysis we were able to easily clone the full length _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ transcripts using cdna obtained from roots but various attempts to isolate the third transcript from this particular tissue revealed unsuccessful . this prompted us to investigate further the endogenous tissue distribution of the _PROTEIN_ transcripts by means of a sequencing approach . to this end we pcr amplified and sequenced a _PROTEIN_ fragment including the nucleotide deletion present only in the _PROTEIN_ transcript independently from root and leaf cdna . as shown in supplemental figure online when using the primer pair which concomitantly amplifies the three transcripts only the sequence corresponding to _PROTEIN_ could be detected in the _PROTEIN_ fragment obtained from root tissues whereas the _PROTEIN_ transcript was also detectable albeit at lower levels in leaves . when using the primer pair which specifically amplifies the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ splice variants we were able to identify only the _PROTEIN_ sequence in the root derived fragment whereas a mixture of rather equivalent amounts of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ was found in the fragment derived from leaf tissues . these sequencing results thus revealed clear tissue specificity of the _PROTEIN_ transcripts with roots exclusively _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ whereas in leaves the _PROTEIN_ splice variant also represented a significant fraction of the _PROTEIN_ transcript pool . to allow inference of the in vivo function of the _PROTEIN_ transporter we isolated two mutant alleles carrying t dna insertions in the _PROTEIN_ gene . the first allele was designated _PROTEIN_ in accordance with citation whereas the second was identified from the gabi kat collection and named _PROTEIN_ . sequence analysis of the genomic dna/t dna junctions determined that both insertions are located in the exon of _PROTEIN_ . rt pcr analysis of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ homozygous seedlings using primers annealing upstream of the insertion sites revealed transcript levels comparable to wild type plants but no _PROTEIN_ was detected when primers flanking or annealing downstream of the t dna segments were used . this indicates that the two mutant alleles produce a truncated version of the three _PROTEIN_ transcripts that lacks the sequence corresponding to the entire second transmembrane domain and are thus unlikely to encode functional _LOCATION_ transporters . these results strongly suggest that both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are true loss of function mutants . because the subcellular localization of the three alternative _METHOD_ was expected to provide important clues in the functional analysis of the _PROTEIN_ gene we next generated c terminal yellow _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ fusions of each isoform and independently cloned them under the control of the promoter . surprisingly transient _PROTEIN_ of these constructs in arabidopsis protoplasts suggested that the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein localizes to the tonoplast whereas _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ appears to be targeted to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . by contrast no _METHOD_ could be detected in any of the transfection assays performed with the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ construct . to further verify the subcellular localization of the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ we generated stable transgenic arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ mutant lines carrying either _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ fused at the c terminal end with the _METHOD_ sequence and placed under the control of the native _PROTEIN_ promoter . confocal microscopy analysis of root apices _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ again indicated tonoplast localization for _PROTEIN_ in both the cortical and epidermal cell layers whereas no _METHOD_ could be detected with this fusion protein in stomatal guard cells . in agreement with the results from our promoter _METHOD_ reporter gene experiments we were also unable to visualize transgene derived _METHOD_ in guard cells of plants _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein . interestingly in these transgenic plants no _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signal was detected in root apices despite detailed analysis of a large number of independent transformants and consistent with the absence of _PROTEIN_ transcript detected in wild type root tissues . in order to unequivocally ascertain the subcellular localization of the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ splice _METHOD_ we subsequently performed colocalization experiments in tobacco leaf epidermal cells using specific tonoplast and _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ markers . as shown in figures to the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein colocalized with the tonoplast marker whereas the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein matched the distribution of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ marker . collectively these findings indicate that the full length _PROTEIN_ and the truncated _PROTEIN_ transporters are localized at the tonoplast and the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ respectively . to investigate the biological role of the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ transporter we performed a detailed phenotypical analysis of the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants . under optimal growth conditions _PROTEIN_ mutant adult plants appeared indistinguishable from the corresponding wild type as illustrated in figure showing also normal flowering time and fertility . however we consistently observed that _PROTEIN_ mutant plants were more sensitive to lack of regular watering as demonstrated by their faster wilting under limited water supply when compared with wild type plants . this effect was quantified using a detached leaf assay and as depicted in figure both the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants clearly exhibited enhanced transpiration rates losing between and of their fresh weight versus only for wild type plants upon h of water stress . similar results were obtained when entire plants were employed instead of detached leaves indicating that the _PROTEIN_ transporter is involved in the regulation of drought stress tolerance in arabidopsis . guard cells play a key role in optimizing plant _PROTEIN_ uptake and concomitant water loss at the leaf interface by precisely controlling stomatal apertures in response to physiological and environmental stimuli . together with the specific _PROTEIN_ promoter activity we detected in guard cells the drought stress hypersensitivity of the _PROTEIN_ mutants prompted us to investigate whether _PROTEIN_ disruption affects stomatal movements . indeed microscopy measurements of stomatal apertures revealed that the stomatal pore was significantly larger in the _PROTEIN_ mutants than in the wild type . this effect was relatively modest under light but markedly more pronounced in the dark or upon treatment with the stress hormone abscisic acid two major effectors triggering stomatal closure . nevertheless _PROTEIN_ mutant stomata retain full sensitivity to both dark and aba mediated stomatal closure indicating that loss of _PROTEIN_ function does not affect the corresponding signaling transduction pathways . these results indicate that the _PROTEIN_ transporter is required for efficient stomatal closure . given the high _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in root tissues and the _PROTEIN_ heterologous _PROTEIN_ results we obtained previously in yeast with the d herbicide and the naturally occurring auxin iaa we next sought to evaluate the pr response of the _PROTEIN_ mutants to exogenous application of these two auxins . although pr growth was unaffected under control conditions _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutant pr elongation exhibited hypersensitivity to the inhibitory effect of d as well as significantly enhanced sensitivity to inhibition by iaa at least at low concentrations of the natural auxin . to determine whether the identified phenotypes were restricted to root elongation we also examined the effect of auxin application on hypocotyl elongation of dark grown seedlings . again no phenotype was observed under control conditions but both d and iaa inhibited hypocotyl elongation to a greater extent in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants than in the wild type . remarkably such an exacerbated sensitivity was not detected when _PROTEIN_ mutant seedlings were _PROTEIN_ with other naturally occurring or synthetic auxinic compounds strongly suggesting that the _PROTEIN_ transporter confers resistance specifically to d and iaa . a detailed characterization of the root system architecture of seedlings grown under control conditions revealed that _PROTEIN_ mutant and wild type roots produce a similar number of total lr structures including lr primordia and emerged lrs . however the proportion of emerged lrs was reduced by in _PROTEIN_ mutant seedlings and these emerged lrs were significantly shorter than those of the wild type . this indicates that the _PROTEIN_ mutants are not defective in lr initiation processes but rather in lr emergence and/or postemergence elongation . furthermore we quantitatively assessed root tip reorientation after gravistimulation and found that both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ exhibit defective root gravitropic bending relative to wild type seedlings . as no differences were observed in linear pr elongation this phenotype is likely to result from an intrinsic defect in the gravitropic response . therefore the _PROTEIN_ mutants are impaired in two developmental processes typically triggered by auxin . in _PROTEIN_ this phytohormone provides a critical stimulatory signal during the two steps of lr development the initiation and emergence phases eliciting also differential growth rates in response to _METHOD_ in particular to root gravitropism . the striking phenotypical similarity displayed by the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutant alleles strongly suggested that the observed defects result from loss of _PROTEIN_ function . to exclude the possibility of the effect of a mutation in another gene we transformed both mutants with a genomic fragment spanning the entire _PROTEIN_ gene which included the same promoter sequence used in the reporter gene experiments . the water loss rates of the corresponding transgenic complementation lines were similar to those of wild type plants . in addition _PROTEIN_ complementation lines exhibited complete restoration of pr and hypocotyl elongation wild type sensitivity to d and iaa . finally genomic complementation of the _PROTEIN_ mutants fully suppressed the lr formation and gravitropic bending defects . we have thus confirmed that disruption of the _PROTEIN_ gene is responsible for the identified _PROTEIN_ mutant phenotypes . moreover the _PROTEIN_ that we observed full rescue of all phenotypes strongly suggests that the full length _PROTEIN_ promoter is comprised in the selected sequence . in light of the above results we next wanted to examine the contribution of the three alternative _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ to the phenotypes established for the _PROTEIN_ mutants . to address this issue we first generated arabidopsis transgenic lines independently _PROTEIN_ each _PROTEIN_ transcript under the control of the promoter in the wild type background for phenotypical characterization . _PROTEIN_ the auxin related phenotypes we found that overexpression of _PROTEIN_ confers increased resistance to the inhibitory effects of exogenously applied d and iaa both at the level of pr and hypocotyl elongation . figure shows that although the number of total lr structures produced by the _PROTEIN_ overexpressing lines was not significantly different from the wild type the ratio between lr primordia and emerged lrs was markedly unwedged to emerged lrs whose length was increased by almost in these plants . overexpression of _PROTEIN_ also conferred enhanced gravity bending ability to the transgenic roots . therefore the auxin related phenotypes of _PROTEIN_ overexpressing lines were strikingly opposite to those discovered for the _PROTEIN_ mutants . by contrast overexpression of _PROTEIN_ had no effect on any of these auxin related processes . however while no change in the transpiration potential of _PROTEIN_ overexpressing leaves was detected leaves from _PROTEIN_ overexpressing plants exhibited significantly lower transpiration rates than those of the wild type . consistent with this and contrary to the _PROTEIN_ mutants _PROTEIN_ overexpressing plants noticeably closed their stomata more efficiently than wild type or _PROTEIN_ overexpressing plants irrespective of the condition tested . finally the _PROTEIN_ overexpressing lines which were included in all the phenotypical assays performed did not exhibit any evident phenotype indicating that this _PROTEIN_ specific transcript has no function at least in the parameters tested . to better ascertain _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ functional specificity we then assessed the ability of these _METHOD_ to suppress the _PROTEIN_ mutant defects by phenotyping the transgenic lines _PROTEIN_ either the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein under the control of the _PROTEIN_ promoter in the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutant backgrounds . as depicted in table complementation with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fully abolished the pr elongation hypersensitivity to exogenous auxins of the _PROTEIN_ mutants but had no effect on their water loss rates . conversely _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fully complemented the drought related phenotype but not the auxin related defects . in addition to demonstrating that the _METHOD_ fusion proteins are functionally active these results together with those from the overexpression studies provide evidence that the two alternative _PROTEIN_ splice _METHOD_ have distinct biological functions with _PROTEIN_ modulating root auxin related processes and _PROTEIN_ regulating drought stress tolerance . the opposite alterations conferred by loss and gain of _PROTEIN_ function in auxin related processes led us to hypothesize that this isoform regulates auxin transport in the arabidopsis root . in a previous study we reported that heterologous _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ isoform confers enhanced d and iaa resistance in s. cerevisiae most likely sustained by an increased efflux from the yeast cell at least in the case of d . we therefore decided to reexamine the auxin transport activity of _PROTEIN_ in parallel to that of _PROTEIN_ in the yeast mutant which lacks an mfs transporter involved in d and iaa resistance . correct _PROTEIN_ of the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion proteins was confirmed by immunoblotting . subcellular localization studies showed that both plant _METHOD_ are targeted to the yeast _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ in agreement with the localization observed in planta for the _PROTEIN_ but not for the _PROTEIN_ isoform . the latter observation is not so surprising as plant proteins particularly transporters may not always be targeted properly when _PROTEIN_ in yeast . we took advantage of _PROTEIN_ mislocalization as _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ targeting is a prerequisite to study _PROTEIN_ transport properties in the background . as seen in supplemental figure online mutant cells _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ or _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ similarly exhibited higher final _METHOD_ and a reduced lag phase in the presence of d or iaa . this enhanced resistance was correlated with a significant reduction in the accumulation of d or iaa in nonadapted yeast cells suddenly exposed to either radiolabeled auxin . compared with yeast cells harboring the empty vector net auxin accumulation was reduced by in cells _PROTEIN_ either of the two plant _METHOD_ indicating that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mediate similar auxin transport activity at least in s. cerevisiae . in agreement with previous reports in yeast heterologous _METHOD_ figure shows that the iaa accumulation rate was reduced by when cells were _PROTEIN_ with the _PROTEIN_ auxin efflux inhibitor naphthylphthalamic acid probably owing to the inhibitory effect this chemical exerts on endogenous yeast transporters . however this negative effect was not further intensified by _PROTEIN_ of either plant isoform indicating that the iaa transport activity mediated by _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ is not inhibited by npa in s. cerevisiae . we next investigated whether the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ transporters also influence cellular auxin levels in arabidopsis using a radiolabeled auxin accumulation assay in excised root tips . the results presented in table show that the saturable accumulation of both d and iaa was increased in _PROTEIN_ mutant root tips when compared with the wild type or _PROTEIN_ overexpressing lines whereas accumulation levels were slightly but significantly reduced by _PROTEIN_ overexpression . as observed with the pr elongation assays the measured effects were more pronounced when assessing d than iaa accumulation . in addition all types of root tips displayed wild type levels of naa accumulation consistent with the wild type responsiveness of their prs to this synthetic auxin analog . as the saturable amount of auxin retained in the root tip reflects the balance between cellular influx and efflux of auxin we then measured the net efflux from root tips preloaded with labeled iaa . figure shows that _PROTEIN_ mutant root tips accumulated more iaa due to _PROTEIN_ efflux whereas _PROTEIN_ overexpressing lines accumulated less auxin as a result of higher iaa efflux rates indicating that _PROTEIN_ influences cellular iaa efflux at the root apex . given the encouraging results described above we next aimed at determining whether the _PROTEIN_ transporter plays a role in the _PROTEIN_ transport of iaa in roots . to this end we first examined the effect of different chemical inhibitors of _PROTEIN_ auxin transport on the elongation of _PROTEIN_ mutant and _PROTEIN_ overexpressing prs . while both root types responded to the auxin influx inhibitor naphthyoxyacetic acid as the wild type mutant and _PROTEIN_ overexpressing lines exhibited enhanced and reduced resistance respectively to the inhibitory effect that the auxin efflux inhibitors npa and triiodobenzoic acid exert on pr elongation . these data reinforce the notion that _PROTEIN_ influences exclusively cellular auxin efflux hinting at its involvement in _PROTEIN_ auxin transport . by contrast _PROTEIN_ overexpressing lines behaved as the wild type in this assay further supporting the finding that the _PROTEIN_ truncated isoform plays no role in auxin related processes . to validate our hypothesis at the whole plant level we indirectly visualized auxin distribution by histochemical staining of wild type and _PROTEIN_ mutant root tips carrying the well described gus auxin responsive reporter construct . under control conditions activity in both types of roots was confined to a small collection of cells comprising the quiescent center and the stem cell niche as previously reported . localized application of iaa at either the hypocotyl root junction or the extreme root tip of wild type and _PROTEIN_ mutant roots similarly led to a substantially more robust staining in these particular cell types . in addition in the wild type background gus staining further extends into the distal elongation zone with a clear gap in the region spanning from the quiescent center to the transition zone . by contrast when iaa was applied at the hypocotyl root junction of _PROTEIN_ mutant roots staining barely spread into the apical meristem with little if any staining evident in the transition or distal elongation zones . the activity pattern of the _PROTEIN_ mutants was also considerably distorted after root tip localized iaa treatment with staining expanding from the quiescent center into the elongation zone without a well defined boundary between the apical meristematic and distal elongation zones . the latter phenomenon was reproducibly observed when iaa was applied at a lower concentration at the root apex . these observations strongly suggest that _PROTEIN_ function facilitates shootward auxin redistribution from stem cells of the extreme root apex to mature cells of the distal elongation zone . indeed auxin distribution is at least qualitatively similarly distorted by mutations in the auxin efflux carrier _PROTEIN_ an established regulator of root shootward auxin transport . the relevance of _PROTEIN_ function to shootward auxin transport was further assessed by directly measuring iaa transport rates in both _PROTEIN_ using the optimized whole root assay described by citation . as _PROTEIN_ is one of the iaa efflux carriers sustaining shootward auxin transport in the root we included the _PROTEIN_ mutant a null _PROTEIN_ allele in the col ecotype in this analysis . the entire assay was also recapitulated replacing iaa by benzoic acid as a weak acid diffusion control . as seen in figure rootward transport rates in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutant roots were comparable to those of the wild type remaining also unaffected by _PROTEIN_ overexpression . by contrast the _PROTEIN_ mutant displayed as expected a pronounced but partial defect in root shootward iaa transport which was reduced by when compared with the wild type in agreement with previous reports . noticeably _PROTEIN_ mutant and _PROTEIN_ overexpressing roots showed significantly _PROTEIN_ and enhanced rates of shootward iaa transport respectively confirming that _PROTEIN_ plays a role in shootward auxin transport at the root tip . furthermore we found that while impairing rootward transport rates to a similar extent in all root types npa treatment failed to inhibit shootward iaa transport rates in the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants to the same extent as in the wild type as already reported for the _PROTEIN_ mutant . despite being slightly less pronounced in the _PROTEIN_ than in the _PROTEIN_ mutant background the opposite effect was observed in _PROTEIN_ overexpressing roots . together with the results from the pr elongation assay in presence of npa the data presented in figure demonstrate that _PROTEIN_ mediated iaa transport activity is npa sensitive in plant . in combination with its npa insensitivity in yeast this further suggests that the tonoplastic _PROTEIN_ transporter does not function as an auxin transporter itself but rather favors shootward auxin flows driven by typical _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ iaa efflux carriers whose iaa export activity is inhibited by npa in both plant and heterologous _METHOD_ . we then hypothesized that _PROTEIN_ function would play a role in fine tuning _PROTEIN_ iaa transport particularly in situations of enhanced auxin fluxes by modulating the activity of a specific auxin transporter . given that _PROTEIN_ influences _PROTEIN_ if not exclusively cellular auxin efflux a prime potential downstream target for this _LOCATION_ mfs transporter was _PROTEIN_ hitherto the sole _PROTEIN_ localized auxin efflux carrier implicated in shootward transport in epidermal cells of the root meristematic and transition zone . as discussed elsewhere carrier mediated auxin transport can be altered by regulating a given transporter s abundance subcellular trafficking or activity levels . since an experimental design to measure _PROTEIN_ activity is still lacking we focused on examining the distribution and steady state levels of _PROTEIN_ at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ by _METHOD_ labeling of native _PROTEIN_ at the pr tip . as expected no _PROTEIN_ signal was detected in the _PROTEIN_ mutant background whereas proper _PROTEIN_ localization of _PROTEIN_ at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ of wild type root tips was observed . this asymmetric subcellular distribution was unaltered upon prolonged iaa treatment consistent with previous reports that the _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ localization is not auxin responsive . importantly even under iaa _PROTEIN_ mislocalization of the auxin efflux carrier was not observed in either _PROTEIN_ loss of function or overexpression lines indicating that _PROTEIN_ function does not interfere with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ targeting . however in the presence of iaa _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ levels appeared to be altered in the _PROTEIN_ loss of function and transgenic lines . we therefore assessed _PROTEIN_ abundance by quantifying the corresponding _METHOD_ signal at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ of root tip epidermal cells . under control conditions _PROTEIN_ incidence at the cell surface was not altered by _PROTEIN_ function as illustrated by the equivalent _PROTEIN_ levels detected in wild type _PROTEIN_ mutant and _PROTEIN_ overexpressing root tips . in seedlings grown in the presence of iaa a substantial reduction in _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ abundance was detected in the wild type consistent with _PROTEIN_ protein degradation following prolonged iaa treatments . notably we found that under iaa _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ stability at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ of root tip epidermal cells was significantly _PROTEIN_ and enhanced by _PROTEIN_ loss of function and overexpression respectively . these results are in clear agreement with the gathered physiological data and indicate that in the context of a stronger _PROTEIN_ iaa stream activity of the _PROTEIN_ transporter influences the steady state levels of _PROTEIN_ at the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ further supporting the notion that _PROTEIN_ acts as a positive regulator of shootward auxin transport . in a first attempt to identify the physiological substrate of the two plant _PROTEIN_ splice _METHOD_ we further examined the response of mutant yeast cells _PROTEIN_ either _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ or _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ to various additional compounds . as seen in supplemental figure online _PROTEIN_ of either _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ or _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ similarly conferred enhanced yeast resistance to two weak acids malate and acetate as well as to the metal ions and as already reported for the latter in the case of the _PROTEIN_ isoform . hence _PROTEIN_ is also able to modulate ion and weak acid sensitivity in yeast . interestingly we also found that _PROTEIN_ of either _PROTEIN_ splice variant dramatically increases yeast sensitivity to the metal ion cs . cesium possesses similar chemical properties to potassium and physiological studies in plants have demonstrated that cs competes with k influx by entering root cells through at least some of the k uptake _METHOD_ . we therefore decided to investigate whether the _PROTEIN_ transporter can also influence k delivery to the yeast cell by evaluating the capacity of the two _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ to rescue the deficient growth of the deletion mutant under limiting potassium concentrations . figure shows that both _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were able to markedly alleviate the pronounced growth defect induced by loss of at low k concentrations . this finding strongly suggests that both the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ possess potassium transport activity . prompted by an earlier microarray study reporting _PROTEIN_ induction upon plant exposure to cs we next investigated whether _PROTEIN_ function affects pr elongation in response to both k and cs . like the loss of function mutants _PROTEIN_ overexpressing plants responded as the wild type to the inhibitory effect induced by k . however in clear contrast with the hyperresistance conferred by the _PROTEIN_ mutations the _PROTEIN_ transgenic line displayed _PROTEIN_ tolerance to inhibitory concentrations of cs . this led us to examine lr formation in the presence of cs . as shown in figure cesium induced the production of lr structures to a similar extent in wild type _PROTEIN_ mutant and _PROTEIN_ overexpression lines . furthermore the ratio between lr primordia and emerged lrs was not significantly altered by either the mutations or enhanced _PROTEIN_ levels and the positive effect exerted by cs on lr elongation was also similar in all genotypes . therefore the effects of loss and gain of _PROTEIN_ function on lr emergence are suppressed in presence of cs which along with the effects of its own toxicity is perceived by root cells as a potassium deficiency . these results thus indicate that _PROTEIN_ may play a role in cs and/or k homeostasis in plant root cells . as mfs transporters are believed to function _PROTEIN_ as proton motive force driven secondary transporters catalyzing uniport symport or antiport activities we analyzed the proton dependence of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ activity in yeast . the intracellular ph regulation is essentially sustained in s. cerevisiae by the action of the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ h _PROTEIN_ . as the activity of this proton pump and the passive proton influx through the yeast _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ can be estimated by monitoring the ph of the external medium we compared the acidification curves of cells _PROTEIN_ the two plant transporters under growth limiting potassium conditions . low potassium levels were previously shown to lead to a reduced rate of _LOCATION_ medium acidification by yeast cells lacking when compared with the wild type strain . importantly _PROTEIN_ of either the _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ or _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ fusion protein was found to increase the rate of h efflux in cells grown in medium with low potassium demonstrating that the two arabidopsis transporters influence proton transport across the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ of yeast cells _PROTEIN_ with potassium deprivation . finally to investigate whether the _PROTEIN_ isoform is also involved in proton transport activity in arabidopsis we assessed _LOCATION_ acidification in root tips using an acidification marker the dye acridine orange . as seen in figure acidification of the central _LOCATION_ was notably enhanced in _PROTEIN_ mutant roots while _PROTEIN_ overexpressing seedlings exhibited a considerable reduction in root _LOCATION_ acidification when compared with the wild type . these results strongly suggest that _PROTEIN_ mediates proton efflux from the _LOCATION_ compartment in arabidopsis root tip cells .
the arabidopsis thaliana col ecotype was used as the wild type in all experiments . seeds of the t dna insertion mutants _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were obtained from nottingham arabidopsis stock centre . the exact t dna insertion sites were confirmed using gene specific primers and primers annealing at the t dna borders which also allowed pcr based genotyping to identify homozygous lines . plant transformation was achieved by the floral dip method using agrobacterium tumefaciens strain . highly similar results were obtained following extensive characterization of all transgenic lines generated for each construct and representative results for one line are presented . seeds were surface sterilized sown on citation medium solidified with agar stratified at for d in the dark and placed in a growth chamber where they were transferred to soil after to weeks . all phenotypical assays were performed in a climate controlled growth cabinet . plants were cultivated either under h or h photoperiod conditions at and rh . hormones antibiotics and other compounds were _PROTEIN_ from sigma aldrich . rt pcr analyses were performed as previously described using primers designed to detect _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . for native _PROTEIN_ promoter reporter gene experiments a fragment including the bp immediately upstream of the first start codon was pcr amplified from genomic dna and inserted via the saci sacii restriction sites into the plasmid . after agroinfiltration of the resulting gus _METHOD_ construct into wild type plants independent transformants were recovered . for synthetic promoter reporter gene experiments wild type and _PROTEIN_ mutant plants were transformed with the gus construct inserted in the _GENE_ vector and six independent transformants per genotype were isolated . histochemical staining of gus activity was performed as described by citation . sequencing analyses were performed on a analyzer using the bigdye terminator cycle sequencing kit according to the manufacturer s instructions _METHOD_ . water loss assays were performed on irrigated nonbolting plants by weighing either detached entire rosette or four rosette leaves at various time intervals at room temperature . stomatal closure assays were performed as described by citation with more than apertures recorded per treatment . pr elongation assays and lr parameter evaluation were performed as previously described . lr primordial stages were scored under the microscope and defined according to citation . for hypocotyl elongation assays seeds were sown directly on control or auxin containing medium plates set in the vertical position and stratified and grown for d in the dark . for root tip reorientation assays d old seedlings grown vertically on control medium were transferred to fresh medium and allowed to grow for an additional d. plates were then rotated anticlockwise and kept in the dark before the angle of root tips from the vertical plane was scored . stomatal apertures pr and hypocotyl elongation and lr length and root deviation angles were measured on scanned images using the imagej software . to generate the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusions each _PROTEIN_ transcript was pcr amplified using root _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or leaf _PROTEIN_ cdna as a template and independently inserted via the xhoi paci restriction sites into the _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ tagged versions of the vector . arabidopsis protoplasts were generated as described by citation transfected with the _METHOD_ constructs by polyethylene glycol

_LOCATION_ marker _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ intrinsic protein _PROTEIN_ mcherry and the pbin na construct in leaf abaxial epidermal cells of tobacco was performed via the agroinfiltration procedure described by citation using agrobacterium strain . for generation of stable transgenic lines the promoter in the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ plasmids was replaced with the _PROTEIN_ promoter . for each construct six transgenic lines were recovered upon transformation of _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ mutant plants . for genomic complementation a bp fragment encompassing the entire _PROTEIN_ gene and including the bp promoter sequence described below was pcr amplified from genomic dna and inserted into the promoterless version of the vector via the hindiii xbai restriction sites . the corresponding construct was introduced into _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutant plants with three complementation lines being recovered for each mutant allele . _PROTEIN_ overexpression constructs were obtained as described for the _METHOD_ plasmids except that the corresponding fragments were inserted via the xhoi asci restriction sites into the background . after agroinfiltration of wild type
