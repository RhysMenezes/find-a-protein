the arabidopsis mutant early in short _PROTEIN_ shows extreme early flowering and alterations in shoot development . we have identified _PROTEIN_ and demonstrate that it encodes a _LOCATION_ protein located predominantly at the periphery of the _LOCATION_ . _PROTEIN_ contains a segment of > amino acids with strong similarity to yeast and animal proteases that are specific for the protein modifier small ubiquitin related modifier . _PROTEIN_ shows a similar function to these proteases in vitro and processes the precursor of arabidopsis sumo to generate the mature form . this activity of _PROTEIN_ is prevented by mutations that affect the predicted active site of the protease or the cleavage site of the atsumo precursor . in yeast these proteases also recycle sumo from conjugates and this appears to be the major role of _PROTEIN_ in vivo . this is suggested because _PROTEIN_ mutants contain less free atsumo and more sumo conjugates than wild type plants and a transgene _PROTEIN_ mature sumo at high levels enhanced aspects of the _PROTEIN_ phenotype . _PROTEIN_ defines an important role for protein modification by atsumo in the regulation of flowering .
we isolated the _PROTEIN_ gene to further understand its role in plant development and the regulation of flowering . previously _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ was located to a centimorgan interval on chromosome between markers and . to increase the resolution of the _PROTEIN_ map position an additional _PROTEIN_ like plants were screened with these markers and _PROTEIN_ was located to a kb region . four overlapping binary vector cosmids spanning this region were introduced into _PROTEIN_ by agrobacterium tumefaciens mediated root transformation to identify those that complemented the mutation . transgenic _PROTEIN_ mutants carrying or flowered at a similar time to the wild type and showed none of the pleiotropic phenotypes of _PROTEIN_ . the region of overlap between and was predicted to encode at least two genes . both genes were amplified from the mutant by pcr and sequenced . _GENE_ was amplified successfully from dna of wild type plants but not from _PROTEIN_ suggesting that this region may contain a deletion in _PROTEIN_ consistent with the mutation having been induced with rays . subsequent analysis revealed a deletion of bp in _PROTEIN_ that removed the first codons from the protein coding sequence and bp upstream of the predicted _PROTEIN_ open reading frame a modified form of _GENE_ . no _PROTEIN_ of _GENE_ was detected by rna gel blot analysis in _PROTEIN_ seedlings although an mrna was found in extracts of wild type plants suggesting that this orf might represent _PROTEIN_ and that _PROTEIN_ is a null allele . previously only a single allele of _PROTEIN_ was isolated . to support our analysis of _PROTEIN_ with a second allele and to strengthen the argument that _GENE_ represents _PROTEIN_ the salk institute genomic analysis laboratory sequence indexed insertion line database was screened for an insertion in this orf . a line carrying a t dna insertion within the predicted _PROTEIN_ gene was recovered . we obtained seeds of this line and identified plants homozygous for the t dna insertion . these plants flowered early under both long and short days and showed the same pleiotropic effects as the _PROTEIN_ mutation . thus we refer to this line as _PROTEIN_ . to confirm the structure of the _GENE_ _PROTEIN_ gene a cdna was identified and sequenced . that this orf encodes _PROTEIN_ was confirmed by demonstrating that _PROTEIN_ of this cognate cdna from the promoter of cauliflower mosaic virus complemented _PROTEIN_ . database searches with the predicted _PROTEIN_ protein sequence identified proteins from yeast mammals caenorhabditis elegans and drosophila as well as other proteins from arabidopsis that showed identity with a region of amino acids at the c terminus of _PROTEIN_ . these proteins included the human _PROTEIN_ specific _PROTEIN_ the yeast ubiquitin like and the mouse _PROTEIN_ specific _PROTEIN_ . this region of _PROTEIN_ and the homologous proteins contains residues predicted to form the active site of a cys protease . several of the homologous proteins are proteases involved in regulating the activity of sumo . a small family of these proteases was described previously in arabidopsis although _PROTEIN_ was not recognized as a member of this family . these proteases show the endopeptidase activity required to generate mature sumo from its precursor and the isopeptidase activity that recycles sumo from conjugates with target proteins . comparison of _PROTEIN_ with other arabidopsis sequences revealed that _PROTEIN_ is part of a larger gene family . the predicted product of one of these genes shows a high degree of identity to _PROTEIN_ over the entire protein sequence whereas another gene is very similar to _PROTEIN_ but the similarity is limited to the predicted protease domain . three other genes show significant identity to the c terminal region of _PROTEIN_ including the residues required to form the active site . in addition a basic local alignment search tool query using and _PROTEIN_ protease domain sequences against predicted arabidopsis proteins revealed a large number of proteins that contain amino acids that are essential to form the protease active site as well as some proteins that lack one or more of these residues . whether _PROTEIN_ shows the sumo endopeptidase activity characteristic of these proteases was tested in vitro . three genes predicted to encode sumo were identified in the arabidopsis genome and the cognate cdnas were isolated . these were named _PROTEIN_ to _PROTEIN_ the same nomenclature used independently by citation . these cdnas were _PROTEIN_ in escherichia coli with an n terminal tag of his residues . the protease is predicted to cleave his atsumo immediately after two highly conserved gly residues near the c terminus thereby removing a short peptide and generating mature his atsumo . to more easily detect this cleavage the size of the peptide removed by hydrolysis was increased by inserting an unrelated protein at the c terminus of sumo . _PROTEIN_ was used for this purpose generating his atsumo _PROTEIN_ . his atsumo _PROTEIN_ was purified from the e. coli extract by nickel exchange chromatography and the expected kd protein was detected in the purified extract using an anti his antibody . his _PROTEIN_ also purified from e. coli then was incubated with his _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ for min . after incubation the mixture was separated on a gel and probed with his antibody . the his _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ protein was either not detected or was present at much lower abundance and a protein smaller than the expected size for his _PROTEIN_ was present . the smaller protein did not appear if his _PROTEIN_ was incubated with his _PROTEIN_ . these experiments suggested that _PROTEIN_ acts in vitro as an _PROTEIN_ c terminal hydrolase . previously sumo c terminal hydrolase was distinguished from deubiquitinating enzymes based on their differential sensitivity to protease inhibitors . the sensitivity of his _PROTEIN_ to these inhibitors was tested by assessing their effect on the in vitro cleavage of his _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . the activity of his _PROTEIN_ was blocked by a thiol reagent and by n ethylmaleimide which inhibited the activity of yeast but not by ubiquitin aldehyde which is a specific inhibitor of deubiquitinating protease . similarly pepstatin a an asp protease inhibitor and benzamidine hcl a trypsin protease inhibitor did not affect his _PROTEIN_ activity . thus _PROTEIN_ is a cys protease with endopeptidase activity similar to that of yeast . cleavage of his _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and his _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ by his _PROTEIN_ also occurred in vitro so under these conditions _PROTEIN_ was not specific to a particular atsumo isoform . to test the specificity of this reaction further mutant _METHOD_ of his _PROTEIN_ and his atsumo _PROTEIN_ were generated and tested in reactions similar to those described above . _PROTEIN_ contains all four residues identified as being conserved between adenovirus protease and related enzymes and predicted to be essential for protease activity . to determine whether the conserved cys residue is required for the observed his _PROTEIN_ activity in vitro it was converted to a ser . the his _PROTEIN_ protein was purified from e. coli extracts and tested for its ability to cleave the his _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ substrate . the mutant protein did not show sumo c terminal hydrolase activity although the protein was detected using anti his antibody indicating that this cys is essential for _PROTEIN_ activity and that the cleavage of his _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is not caused by another protease present in the reaction . in another experiment designed to test the specificity of this reaction a mutation was generated within the his _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . the c terminal hydrolase activity is predicted to cleave sumo immediately after the conserved gly residues _PROTEIN_ close to the c terminus which as illustrated in the crystal structure of the sumo complex are recognized by conserved amino acids within the active site of the protease . to determine whether these gly residues are required for the cleavage of his _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ observed in vitro they were converted to ala. no cleavage of his _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was detected in vitro . therefore cleavage of his _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in vitro requires the gly residues shown previously to be essential for sumo maturation suggesting that it occurs precisely as predicted for the c terminal hydrolysis of sumo . this conclusion also is supported by the size of the cleaved product which is slightly smaller than the his _PROTEIN_ precursor synthesized in e. coli . whether _PROTEIN_ affects sumoylation in vivo was tested using rabbit polyclonal antibodies raised against his _PROTEIN_ and his _PROTEIN_ . as a result of the high degree of identity between these proteins both antibodies recognized all three sumo _METHOD_ made in e. coli . in protein extracts of wild type plants a protein of the size expected for atsumo was detected with the anti _PROTEIN_ antibody . in addition several larger proteins that may correspond to conjugates between atsumo and target proteins were detected . in _PROTEIN_ extracts putative sumo conjugates were increased dramatically in abundance compared with wild type plants . furthermore the abundance of free sumo was reduced in _PROTEIN_ mutant plants compared with that in the wild type . these results support a role for _PROTEIN_ in sumo metabolism in vivo and suggest that its major function is to recycle atsumo from conjugates causing an accumulation of conjugated atsumo and a reduced abundance of the free form . the involvement of a sumo protease predominantly in recycling sumo from conjugates was proposed for of yeast . comparisons of sumo and sumo conjugate levels in wild type and _PROTEIN_ mutant plants suggested that the major role of _PROTEIN_ in vivo is to recycle sumo from conjugates . to examine this possibility further we tested whether overexpression of the mature or precursor _METHOD_ of sumo affected the phenotype of _PROTEIN_ mutants . of particular interest was whether the _PROTEIN_ of mature _METHOD_ of sumo reduced the severity of the mutant phenotype as might be expected if the protease acts as an endopeptidase required to generate mature sumo from the precursor . promoter fusions to _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ as well as to truncated open reading frames encoding each of the mature _METHOD_ were constructed . all six constructs were introduced into wild type and _PROTEIN_ mutant plants . all of these transgenes had similar effects on conjugate profiles and on the phenotypes of the plants . in the _PROTEIN_ mutant the _PROTEIN_ of mature _PROTEIN_ from the promoter increased the abundance of conjugates to an even higher level and similar effects were observed with the other five transgenes . by contrast the abundance of conjugates was not increased in transgenic ler plants _PROTEIN_ mature _PROTEIN_ or carrying the other transgenes . the transgenes also had more severe phenotypic effects on _PROTEIN_ mutants than on wild type plants . the _PROTEIN_ mutants _PROTEIN_ mature _PROTEIN_ were dramatically shorter and dwarfed compared with the progenitor mutant and similar phenotypes were created by the overexpression of the other atsumo transgenes . by contrast overexpression of atsumo or the mature form in wild type plants did not dramatically alter their phenotype consistent with previous observations . analysis of the transgenic plants supported the suggestion that the _PROTEIN_ phenotype is caused by impaired recycling of sumo from conjugates and therefore is enhanced by increasing the abundance of these conjugates in transgenic plants overexpressing atsumo . furthermore the reduced efficiency of the processing of mature sumo from the precursor is unlikely to contribute greatly to the _PROTEIN_ phenotype because _PROTEIN_ of the mature form did not reduce the effect of the mutation . in yeast and animal cells different _METHOD_ of sumo proteases differ in their subcellular locations . to test this for _PROTEIN_ an _PROTEIN_ green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ fusion protein was _PROTEIN_ in an _PROTEIN_ mutant from the promoter . the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgene fully complemented all aspects of the _PROTEIN_ mutant phenotype . the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein was visualized in root cells by confocal microscopy . the protein was detected specifically in the _LOCATION_ . the subnuclear location of the protein was examined at higher magnification in root hair cells and in the root epidermis . in both cases the protein was detected at highest abundance at the periphery of the _LOCATION_ apparently in association with the _LOCATION_ envelope . in addition an antibody against his _PROTEIN_ was raised in rabbits . protein gel blots were prepared using _LOCATION_ protein extracts made from wild type and _PROTEIN_ seedlings . the antibody detected a protein of the expected size for _PROTEIN_ in _LOCATION_ extracts of wild type plants but not in _PROTEIN_ mutants . this finding further indicated that _PROTEIN_ is located in the _LOCATION_ . the _PROTEIN_ mutant has a pleiotropic phenotype suggesting that _PROTEIN_ may be required in a variety of plant tissues . _PROTEIN_ mrna _PROTEIN_ was examined by rna gel blot analysis and was present in seedlings leaves shoots flowers and roots of wild type plants . many flowering time genes show a diurnal pattern of _PROTEIN_ so this was tested for _PROTEIN_ . however the abundance of the _PROTEIN_ mrna was constant through a h cycle indicating that it did not exhibit a diurnal rhythm in its _PROTEIN_ . many flowering time genes identified by loss of function mutations also have an effect on flowering when overexpressed therefore we examined the effect of overexpressing _PROTEIN_ from the promoter of cauliflower mosaic virus in wild type ler plants . plants carrying the _PROTEIN_ transgene contained increased levels of the _PROTEIN_ mrna but they flowered at the same time as ler controls under long and short days suggesting that _PROTEIN_ activity is saturated at wild type levels of _PROTEIN_ .

resulting entry clone was used in an lr reaction with the destination binary vector palligator _PROTEIN_ . this generated a translational fusion between the tag and the mature form of atsumo at the n
