increasing numbers of cellular pathways are now recognized to be regulated via proteolytic processing events . the rhomboid family of serine proteases plays a pivotal role in a diverse range of pathways activating and releasing proteins via regulated intramembrane proteolysis . the prototype rhomboid protease rhomboid in drosophila is the key activator of epidermal growth _PROTEIN_ receptor pathway signalling in the fly and thus affects multiple aspects of development . the role of the rhomboid family in plants is explored and another developmental phenotype this time in a mutant of an arabidopsis chloroplast localized rhomboid is reported here . it is confirmed by _METHOD_ protein fusion that this protease is located in the envelope of chloroplasts and of chlorophyll free _LOCATION_ elsewhere in the plant . mutant plants lacking this organellar rhomboid demonstrate reduced fertility as documented previously with _PROTEIN_ one other arabidopsis rhomboid mutant that has been reported in the with aberrant floral morphology .
the _PROTEIN_ protein encoded by contains six hydrophobic regions predicted to form transmembrane spans following a aa predicted chloroplast targeting sequence . this would produce an unmodified version of the protein of _METHOD_ kda with the aa sequence listed in most arabidopsis genome databases . this predicted rhomboid protein fits best in the secretase subgroup and contains the catalytic site residues that suggest that this rhomboid type is enzymatically active . similarity between rhomboids is high enough to make them easily identified in other plants the most similar sequence to _PROTEIN_ among sequenced plants being a putative protein from populus trichocarpa which is identical at the amino acid level . the most similar non land plant sequences are putative rhomboids from unicellular algae micromonas and chlamydomonas at and identical respectively . the clostridium _PROTEIN_ genome encodes the most similar prokaryotic protease . translation of the sequence from cdna produced in rt pcr from various tissues in col a. thaliana showed that the _PROTEIN_ encoding open reading frame in arabidopsis sequence databases may be variable or incorrect . in our work two different possible transcripts were found . an alternative splice site in intron increased its size from nt to nt causing a loss of nt from exon and a stop codon producing frameshift . with only one transmembrane domain encoded by the truncated mrna this transcript would not result in a functional protease . a second variant however encoded a polypeptide lacking seven amino acids in the predicted transmembrane helix and would still produce a functional protease . from our sequence data this appears to be the true encoded amino acid sequence not that predicted by tair . this difference in the encoded protein does not alter the transmembrane domains but does make the _PROTEIN_ protein align better with its most closely related rhomboids and the most similar protein in poplar in particular . the short non coding region upstream of _PROTEIN_ contains the core of the low temperature responsive element of the a. thaliana _PROTEIN_ gene which is repeated twice in the _PROTEIN_ promoter . no other sequence features are scored as reliable by prediction _METHOD_ . unfortunately the usual means of investigating the timing and location of transcription with a promoter gus fusion construct transformed into a. thaliana did not produce any localization information . there was no x gal staining under various conditions in roots seedlings or floral tissues all locations that were examined because they would have corresponded with the mutant phenotype or microarray data . it is therefore likely that the introns contain regulatory information with respect to _PROTEIN_ . transformation of a _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ construct into arabidopsis revealed that as predicted by its putative signal peptide _PROTEIN_ protein is localized to chloroplast _LOCATION_ . in _METHOD_ microscopy this manifests itself as green _METHOD_ in emerging true leaves with their high density of cells and chloroplasts . using the confocal microscope _METHOD_ can consistently be observed in the chloroplast _LOCATION_ throughout development _LOCATION_ lending bright _METHOD_ even early on in a time series since emerging leaves have a high concentration of chloroplasts . localization is seen in the _LOCATION_ envelope in both leaf and root and is perhaps most clearly observed in the latter . in day leaves the localized _METHOD_ appeared clearly external to the chlorophyll _METHOD_ of the chloroplast . the single n terminal transit peptide of _PROTEIN_ would suggest the location of the mature rhomboid in the chloroplast inner or outer _LOCATION_ but the exact location can not currently be accurately predicted from the presequence nor whether the latter is cleaved by a processing peptidase if indeed the outer _LOCATION_ is the final location . also of interest are the _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _LOCATION_ emanating from and linking the organelles these can be seen in both root _LOCATION_ and chloroplasts . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ protein localization . confocal microscopy of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein _PROTEIN_ in the chloroplast _LOCATION_ throughout development _LOCATION_ . _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ showing _LOCATION_ localization at day . _PROTEIN_ concentrated in seedling emerging leaves viewed with _METHOD_ and confocal microscope . in silico analysis not only corresponds with the chloroplast localization of the protein and predicted chloroplast signal peptide but interestingly the _PROTEIN_ coexpression database also identifies the top co regulated proteins as being the chloroplast _LOCATION_ protein _PROTEIN_ a like putative intramembrane metalloprotease and _PROTEIN_ a dihydrodipicolinate reductase essential for chloroplast nad h dehydrogenase activity . _PROTEIN_ database analysis of transcriptional coregulation with _PROTEIN_ identifies two chloroplast proteins _PROTEIN_ a like putative _LOCATION_ located metalloprotease and _PROTEIN_ a dihydrodipicolinate reductase essential for chloroplast nad h dehydrogenase activity . our own transcript analysis and published microarray data for _PROTEIN_ suggest low level _PROTEIN_ in many tissues and _METHOD_ . in rt pcr _PROTEIN_ transcript was amplified from rna prepared from tissues as follows seedling mature rosette leaf bolt stem petiole open flowers and immature siliques . transcript could not be detected in day seedling tissues at radical emergence . various stresses were also looked at in order to examine any change in transcription levels . infection with cucumber mosaic virus did not increase the levels of the _PROTEIN_ transcript but whereas normally transcript was found to be difficult to amplify from the root it was detected in roots if seedlings had been subjected to cold stress . microarray data compiled using genevestigator also suggest transcription in all developmental stages but a peak of transcription at early flowering and anatomical peaks in the leaf primordia juvenile leaf cotyledons pedicel and shoot apex . similarly arabidopsis _METHOD_ browser records flower stage pedicel and vegetative rosette as having the highest levels of transcription but with transcript again present in all tissues _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . in roots transcription is recorded as similar in all regions but genevestigator puts the peak in the root hair zone and arexdb in the elongation zone . transcription is reported as being most upregulated in the _PROTEIN_ mutant . a null mutant line of _PROTEIN_ was segregated to homozygosity . to confirm that the line was null rt pcr at saturating cycle numbers was used to check that the transcript could not be amplified from tissues in which cdna was routinely isolated in the wild type and the presence of a single t dna insertion was confirmed by southern analysis . pcr also allowed the insertion of the t dna to be located . a second null line was included to confirm aspects of the phenotype and treated as above . t dna insertions were found in exon for salk _PROTEIN_ and in intron for _PROTEIN_ . since the a. thaliana kom mutant has a floral phenotype but rt pcr and microarray data suggested widespread transcription of _PROTEIN_ and the orf contained a likely chloroplast targeting sequence our observation of the _PROTEIN_ mutants included growth characteristics floral development and photosynthetic parameters such as f v/f m and pigment content . inactivational insertion of _PROTEIN_ resulted in slightly faster root growth than in the wt . roots were longer than in col seedlings in duplicate assays from day to day p.s . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and p < d.f. respectively . there was another small difference in the rate of germination which might account for roots being longer in the first week _PROTEIN_ . the most dramatic feature of root growth which corresponds with the faster rate of growth in the _PROTEIN_ mutants was the formation of _PROTEIN_ roots . this was clearly evident when plants were grown on plates and was again statistically significant mutant developed twice as many _PROTEIN_ roots at around week p.s . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . there was no dramatic impact on the appearance of plants or time to flowering despite these differences in root growth . root growth over time post stratification of lines _PROTEIN_ and versus wt and _PROTEIN_ root number at day p.s . _LOCATION_ . chlorophyll a and b and total chlorophyll levels were the same in the mutant and the wt despite the growth differences seen and the likely chloroplast _LOCATION_ location of the _PROTEIN_ protein . a tendency for the mutant to contain more anthocyanin than the wt at the moderately high light intensity of and was noted but the conditions causing this require further investigation since the results were variable . mean pigment content of the _PROTEIN_ mutant . total chlorophyll and chlorophyll a and b per gram _LOCATION_ under standard growth conditions versus col . pulse amplitude modulation _PROTEIN_ fluorimetry was utilized to investigate the effect of insertional inactivation of _PROTEIN_ on protective photosynthetic response . at low light levels there were no significant differences between dark _PROTEIN_ col and the mutant in standard parameters . in the case of f v/f m photosystem ii maximum efficiency both wt and mutant yielded figures of . the same plants showed no indication of abnormal or damaged photosynthetic pathways in _METHOD_ of photochemical quenching and non photochemical quenching . feedback de excitation dissipates excess absorbed light energy as heat thereby protecting plants from high light stress which is quantified by the parameter npq and quantum yield of psii . the tendency to a difference in npq was amplified in the mutant in higher intensity light however . at both col and _PROTEIN_ gave an f v/f m of and qp but the mean npq was in the wt and in the mutant . mean was only slightly different at in col and in the mutant but the difference was just significant . in very high intensity light f v/f m qp and remained similar but again mean npq was markedly higher in mutant _PROTEIN_ . the aberrant pollen phenotype of the kom rhomboid mutant and the presence of _PROTEIN_ transcript in floral tissues also prompted investigation of the fertility of the mutant lines compared with the wt under both normal and high intensity light conditions . pollen and floral development were also examined using staining light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy . within the inflorescences the two independent mutant lines showed their most profound phenotypic abnormalities . a proportion of pollen developed poorly . viewed using cryo _PROTEIN_ the heterogeneous pollen grains were half the length of wt with some collapsed grains and flatter surface topology although this was not as severe as the effects seen in the kom mutant . alexander staining confirmed that some pollen was malformed or unviable . flowers also occurred in mutant lines with other abnormalities such as five _PROTEIN_ and the stigma in particular was commonly affected appearing as a double stigma or with other distortions in shape and size . as a result few siliques develop successfully on the plant especially early in inflorescence development and the number of seed per silique on the primary inflorescence was significantly lower than in the wt plant . as the inflorescence developed the mutant plants showed improved siliques and seed production over time . aberrant floral development in _PROTEIN_ mutants . wt flowers . mutant flowers showed various abnormalities the stigma particularly commonly affected . a return to normal morphology was observed when the mutant line was complemented with the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ construct . the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ construct was transformed into the _PROTEIN_ mutant line to discover if returning the wt orf would restore a wild type phenotype . antibiotic resistant seedlings _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ were selected and grown on to produce seed and for further investigation . complementing the _PROTEIN_ mutant with the _METHOD_ construct did indeed correct the mutant phenotype . there was no significant difference between the complemented line and the wt in the major aspects of the mutant phenotype namely number of seeds/silique on the primary inflorescence and previously aberrant stigma anther and _PROTEIN_ morphology was corrected .
wild type and mutant lines were grown in compost in greenhouses _PROTEIN_ at . for growth assays and transformed plants half strength murashige and skoog _METHOD_ agar was used and plates or pots were incubated in a growth room at with light of . for high intensity light assays when testing photosynthetic parameters a fitotron growth chamber was used . two t dna insertion lines _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ were _PROTEIN_ from the nottingham arabidopsis stock centre and segregated until homozygous . the presence and location of single t dna insertions were confirmed by southern analysis according to and the absence of transcript by rt pcr . growth assays of mutant lines were conducted on plates in which one half of each plate was sown with mutant and the other half with wt seed with seeds on each half for germination counts . imagej was used to record measurements from digital images of plates . dna manipulation was performed essentially according to et al . . primers for amplifying cdna were _PROTEIN_ and tcaaagccgtcgctgttcatt along with ggatttaagctcgagtctga and caccaagtaagccaccaa for locating t dna insertions . for the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein primers were cgggatccgaagatggtatcagtgtca and ggaattcaagccgtcgctgttcatt . primers for the _PROTEIN_ promoter were _PROTEIN_ and ttcccgggatcttccccttcacgtttc . all constructs were based upon vectors from the john innes centre norwich uk or the gift of the j haseloff group university of cambridge cambridge uk namely a camv _METHOD_ containing vector for fusing _PROTEIN_ n terminal of _METHOD_ and containing the _PROTEIN_ gene for constructing the _PROTEIN_ promoter gus vector . for transcript analysis via rt pcr primers were used that would generate product across introns to differentiate any genomic contamination in template from transcript . to investigate transcript levels in specific tissues rt pcr was carried out using control primers to _PROTEIN_ and the appropriate template concentration was used . promoter _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ encoding vectors were transformed into wild type or _PROTEIN_ mutant arabidopsis as required for localization studies or complementation via agrobacterium tumefaciens and floral dipping . transformed plants were grown on _METHOD_ plates as above supplemented with antibiotic as appropriate and antibiotic resistant plants were grown on in compost . the _PROTEIN_ mutant was complemented to ensure a return of wt characteristics by transforming it with a wt copy of the _PROTEIN_ transcript fused n terminal of _METHOD_ under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus promoter . effects on seed and floral phenotypes were checked in three independent transformant lines . for promoter gus localization tissues were stained according to et al . . tissues were fixed in ice cold acetone for min rinsed twice in gus working solution _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and stained by adding mg stock bromo chloro indolyl d _PROTEIN_ cyclohexamine salt at buffer vacuum infiltrating the tissue and incubating for h as required at . tissues were cleared with ethanol . pollen and inflorescence tissues were examined using cryo scanning electron microscopy _PROTEIN_ . the alexander stain was carried out essentially according to et al . . initial visualization to identify _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ plants was by _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . for confocal microscopy tissues were excited at the peak of _METHOD_ absorbance at nm and emission recorded at by confocal microscopy _PROTEIN_ . samples were examined with a oil immersion objective lens with a numerical aperture of . _METHOD_ intensity was measured in nm windows and displayed in the tcs software as spectra . control plants were untransformed wt _METHOD_ auxin reporter transformed plants and extensin _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ lines . pulse amplitude modulation fluorimetry was used to measure the quantum yield of photosystem ii according to the manufacturer s instructions . estimation of chlorophyll content was carried out according to and et al . extracting pigment with _PROTEIN_ cl buffered acetone . anthocyanin extraction was with hcl methanol according to et al . .
