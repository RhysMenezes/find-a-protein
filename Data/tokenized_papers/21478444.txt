l ara an important constituent of plant cell walls is found predominantly in the furanose rather than in the thermodynamically more stable pyranose form . nucleotide sugar mutases have been demonstrated to interconvert udp l arabinopyranose and udp l arabinofuranose _PROTEIN_ in rice . these enzymes belong to a small gene family encoding the previously named reversibly glycosylated proteins _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ are plant specific _LOCATION_ proteins that tend to associate with the endomembrane system . in arabidopsis thaliana the _PROTEIN_ protein family consists of five closely related members . we characterized all five _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ their _PROTEIN_ pattern and subcellular localizations in transgenic arabidopsis plants . enzymatic activity assays of recombinant proteins _PROTEIN_ in escherichia coli identified three of the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ protein family members as udp l ara mutases that catalyze the formation of udp _PROTEIN_ from udp arap . coimmunoprecipitation and subsequent liquid chromatography electrospray ionization tandem _METHOD_ _METHOD_ analysis revealed a distinct interaction network between _PROTEIN_ in different arabidopsis organs . examination of cell wall polysaccharide preparations from _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ knockout mutants showed a significant reduction in total l ara content compared with wild type plants . concomitant downregulation of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ results in plants almost completely deficient in cell wall derived l ara and exhibiting severe developmental defects .
the _PROTEIN_ patterns of arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ in various tissues such as roots seedlings rosette leaves _METHOD_ inflorescences and siliques at different developmental stages were assessed by quantitative rt pcr . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ transcripts were detected in all examined tissues with highest amounts in flowers seedlings and developing siliques . in contrast _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ transcripts were almost exclusively detected in siliques with the highest levels to d post anthesis . to obtain better spatially and developmentally resolved information on _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ we stably _PROTEIN_ these proteins as fusion proteins carrying a c terminal yellow _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ tag driven by their native promoters in arabidopsis . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ proteins were detected in all major arabidopsis organs . in immature plants _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was predominantly _PROTEIN_ in shoot and root apical _METHOD_ . during the reproductive stage _PROTEIN_ was detected in pollen phloem and epidermal cells of inflorescence _METHOD_ leaves and seed coat epidermal cells . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was predominantly _PROTEIN_ in the epidermis and phloem of inflorescence _METHOD_ root _METHOD_ and pollen . strong _METHOD_ signals were also observed originating from leaf trichome cells of immature plants leaf epidermis and seed coat epidermal cells . similarly _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ appeared to be ubiquitously _PROTEIN_ throughout plant development . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was detected in leaves stem epidermis and phloem root vasculature as well as _METHOD_ and seed coat epidermis . in contrast _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was restricted to developing seeds . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signals were detected in areas corresponding to the endosperm of developing seeds at the linear and bent cotyledon stage . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was only observed in seed coat epidermal cells of seeds at the linear to mature cotyledon stage . _PROTEIN_ are predicted not to contain any transmembrane domain or known targeting sequence . to investigate the subcellular localizations of the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ we analyzed stably and transiently _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusions driven by their native or the constitutive cauliflower mosaic virus promoter . in our _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ approach _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ exhibited an identical subcellular localization pattern . both proteins localized to moving punctate structures apparently corresponding to _LOCATION_ vesicles as well as to the _LOCATION_ . in addition we observed _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signals originating from larger particles floating within the _LOCATION_ . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ appeared predominantly to be localized to the _LOCATION_ and to a lesser extent associated with _LOCATION_ like particles . although _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were strongly _PROTEIN_ in developing seeds no conclusive information could be obtained on their subcellular localizations using this approach . the integrities and functionalities of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion proteins _PROTEIN_ under the control of their native promoters were confirmed by immunoblotting and enzyme activity assays using immunoprecipitated proteins . further proof of functionality and correct targeting of the _METHOD_ fusion proteins was obtained by complementation analysis of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutant lines . introduction of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ constructs into the respective mutant backgrounds fully complemented their biochemical phenotypes . when stably _PROTEIN_ under the control of the camv promoter in arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ signals could only be observed originating from larger particles floating within the _LOCATION_ most likely corresponding to protein aggregates . by contrast _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ localization appeared to be similar to its subcellular localization pattern when _PROTEIN_ under the control of the native promoter . when transiently _PROTEIN_ in tobacco leaves _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ originated from _LOCATION_ like particles as well as from the _LOCATION_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ appeared to be predominantly localized to the _LOCATION_ . similarly _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ originated from _LOCATION_ like particles and from the _LOCATION_ . to obtain further information on _PROTEIN_ subcellular localizations we separated plant cell extracts derived from _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ ha _PROTEIN_ transgenic lines into _LOCATION_ peripheral _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ protein fractions . as shown in figure all five _PROTEIN_ were predominantly detected in _LOCATION_ and peripheral _LOCATION_ protein fractions and except for _PROTEIN_ none of the _PROTEIN_ was detected in detergent solubilized _LOCATION_ fractions . as controls _LOCATION_ fru bisphosphatase _LOCATION_ secretion associated and ras related _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and calreticulin _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ were predominantly detected in their proposed subcellular fractions . to differentiate between peripheral _LOCATION_ and luminal proteins we subjected microsomal fractions to proteinase k treatments followed by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and immunoblotting . whereas all five _PROTEIN_ were detected in untreated microsomal fractions proteinase k treatment completely degraded the corresponding proteins . as a control calreticulins were protected from degradation indicative for intactness of _LOCATION_ cisternae and _LOCATION_ vesicles under our experimental conditions . the five arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ were heterologously _PROTEIN_ as hexahistidine tag fusion proteins in escherichia coli and affinity purified for subsequent enzymatic assays . immunoblot analysis of the purified proteins revealed two predominant bands for each protein detected by the anti hexahistidine antibody within the range of to kd which is in agreement with their predicted molecular _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . recombinant proteins were tested for udp ara mutase activity as described by citation . as substrates we provided either udp arap or udp _PROTEIN_ . the corresponding reaction products were separated by hplc and subsequently identified by electrospray ionization _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . mutase activity was observed for recombinant _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . in contrast hplc analyses of enzymatic reactions containing recombinant _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ did not reveal any additional peaks compared with control reactions . when udp _PROTEIN_ was used as a substrate a rapid conversion into udp arap was detected for recombinant _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ with activities _PROTEIN_ > _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . when udp arap was used as a substrate only small amounts were converted into udp _PROTEIN_ by the active enzymes consistent with a thermodynamic equilibrium of as observed in rice . lc esi _METHOD_ analysis of the udp arap and udp _PROTEIN_ peaks identified these compounds with a molecular _METHOD_ of and respectively which is consistent with the calculated theoretical _METHOD_ of . when other udp sugars were provided as substrate no additional peaks or reduction of the corresponding substrate was observed when reacted with any of the recombinant _PROTEIN_ proteins or mixtures thereof . the specificity for udp ara is in contrast to the flavin adenine dinucleotide containing udp gal mutases known from several _METHOD_ which have activity with both udp d gal and udp l ara . _PROTEIN_ from various plant species have been demonstrated to form homoprotein or heteroprotein complexes . to investigate the arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ protein complex formation composition and enzymatic activities we stably _PROTEIN_ the corresponding proteins in arabidopsis as translational hemagglutinin tag fusions under the control of their native promoters . the _PROTEIN_ ha proteins were subsequently immunoprecipitated from total protein extracts derived from seedlings _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or protein extracts derived from developing siliques _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ separation followed by sypro ruby protein gel staining revealed multiple bands in each of the _PROTEIN_ ha immunoprecipitates with at least three components which is indicative of an association in a protein complex . immunoblots detected the corresponding ha tagged polypeptide as a single band in each of the five _PROTEIN_ ha extracts . lc esi _METHOD_ was used to identify the corresponding complex components in in solution tryptic digested extracts . unambiguously identified proteins _PROTEIN_ are listed in table and peptide sequences in supplemental table online . when _PROTEIN_ ha was used as bait _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were coprecipitated . reciprocal interactions were observed for _PROTEIN_ ha _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ ha _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ pull down experiments . in protein samples derived from developing siliques _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ ha _PROTEIN_ coprecipitated with the tagged _PROTEIN_ protein . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were coprecipitated when the _PROTEIN_ ha protein was used as bait . identified protein complex components in _PROTEIN_ immunoprecipitates immunoprecipitated protein complexes were tested for udp ara mutase activity with udp arap and udp _PROTEIN_ as substrates . hplc analysis of the corresponding reaction products revealed mutase activity in all five immunoprecipitated extracts which supports our proteomic data demonstrating the existence of at least one active mutase in each protein complex . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were previously proposed to act redundantly in pollen development . double knockouts were determined to be male gametophyte lethal with an arrest in pollen mitosis whereas single mutants did not exhibit phenotypic alterations compared with wild type plants . however single mutant lines have not been analyzed with _PROTEIN_ to their cell wall monosaccharide composition . to further characterize _PROTEIN_ function and the impact of udp arap/udp _PROTEIN_ interconversion on plant development we analyzed single _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants and created a hairpin construct specifically targeting _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . two independent _PROTEIN_ mutant lines _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ carrying a t dna insertion either in the first or the third intron respectively were identified in the gabi kat collection and two independent _PROTEIN_ mutant alleles _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ carrying a t dna insertion in the third exon or the first intron respectively were identified in the signal collection . plants carrying homozygous insertions were selected by pcr . the effect of the t dna insertion on mrna _PROTEIN_ levels was examined using qrt pcr . no transcripts were detected in homozygous _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ individuals and > reductions in transcript amounts were determined for plants carrying the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ alleles . even though single knockout lines did not show any growth phenotypic alterations compared with accession columbia wild type plants cell wall monosaccharide analysis revealed a significant reduction in total cell wall ara content in _PROTEIN_ mutants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . other cell wall sugars were not significantly altered when compared with the col wild type . consistently determination of udp ara mutase activities in _LOCATION_ and microsomal protein extracts using udp _PROTEIN_ as substrate revealed about a reduction in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants compared with the col wild type . this was further corroborated by quantifying udp arap udp xyl and udp glc in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ plant seedlings . indeed in the mutant plants udp arap was increased by and in the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutants respectively . moreover the direct precursor of udp arap udp xyl was also increased in these mutants . traces of udp _PROTEIN_ could be found both in the mutant lines as well as in the wild type and hinted at a reduction in the mutant lines but amounts were below the limit of quantification . mutase activities in _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and lines udp sugar contents in the col wild type and _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mutant lines to examine the consequences of a simultaneous downregulation of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ on cell wall monosaccharide composition and developmental phenotype habits we generated plant lines _PROTEIN_ a hairpin construct specifically targeting _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . qrt pcr analysis of nine randomly selected independent transgenic individuals revealed three classes of lines with varying degrees of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . the first class contained lines with slightly reduced _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ levels similar to control plants transformed with an empty vector the second class contained plants with an intermediate reduction in _PROTEIN_ and the third class was represented by lines with a strong reduction in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . as shown in figure _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ was not affected in lines . subsequent monosaccharide analysis of cell wall polysaccharide extracts derived from lines revealed a strong correlation between the level of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and total cell wall ara content _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . up to an reduction in cell wall polysaccharide ara content was measured for the and lines which exhibited the strongest reduction in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . moreover the reduction in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and correspondingly reduced cell wall ara content was accompanied by severe developmental defects compared with control lines . plants with a to _PROTEIN_ and to _PROTEIN_ reduction in _PROTEIN_ resulting in a to reduction in ara content were phenotypically indistinguishable from control plants . in contrast and lines with reductions of and in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ respectively and a subsequent reduction in total cell wall ara of were severely developmentally retarded resulting in dwarf phenotypes . notably the majority of all transgenic lines showed arrested development and died immediately after selection . determination of udp ara mutase activities in _LOCATION_ and microsomal protein extracts using udp _PROTEIN_ as substrate revealed > reduction in lines compared with control lines transformed with an empty vector . analysis of sugar composition in cell wall preparations from wild type and lines suggested a slightly altered composition besides the reduction in ara _PROTEIN_ . a closer inspection indicated that gal and rha were disproportionately increased in the lines . to further investigate the impact of reduced udp arap/udp _PROTEIN_ interconversion on different cell wall polymers we extracted the cell wall preparations sequentially with cyclohexanediaminetetraacetic acid and . the to _PROTEIN_ in l ara was similar in all fractions . neither the cdta fraction nor the fraction from the lines showed any significant differences in sugar composition besides the _PROTEIN_ in ara . in contrast the increase in gal and rha observed in the total cell wall preparations was also evident in the residue after extraction with cdta and . furthermore while gala content did not differ in total amount it showed a significantly different extractability between the control and lines _PROTEIN_ . these observations indicate that the plants respond to the _PROTEIN_ in ara by increasing rhamnogalacturonan i polymers . however rg i in the walls is less easily extracted . monosaccharide composition of plant cell wall polysaccharide fractions derived from the wild type and lines since l ara in arabinan side chains is a major constituent of pectin and the mucilage secretory cells of the arabidopsis seed coat constitute a prominent model system for cell wall establishment in particular for pectin synthesis and modification we analyzed derived seeds for mucilage extrusion . the seed mucilage can be visualized by staining with ruthenium red . staining of water imbibed mutant seeds derived from lines and which had the greatest reduction in ara contents revealed an immediate solubilization of the outer mucilage and only faint staining of the inner mucilage . in contrast wild type and seeds showed intense spherical staining of the inner and outer mucilage which was still attached to the seed . since we found _PROTEIN_ to be a third component of the _PROTEIN_ protein complex we created a hairpin construct specifically targeting _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . however repression of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ to as low as of the wild type level in nine randomly selected transgenic lines did not result in any morphological alterations or significant differences in the cell wall monosaccharide composition .
