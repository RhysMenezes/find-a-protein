a protein from arabidopsis thaliana heynh . showing homology to animal proteins of the napi family involved in the transport of inorganic phosphate chloride glutamate and sialic acid has been characterized . this protein named _PROTEIN_ was shown by chloroplast subfractionation to be localized to the _LOCATION_ inner envelope in both a. thaliana and spinacia oleracea . immunolocalization revealed that _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ in the leaf mesophyll cells as well as in the developing embryo at the upturned u stage . five additional homologues of _PROTEIN_ are found in the arabidopsis genome of which one was shown by green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ fusion to be also located in the chloroplast . all _PROTEIN_ proteins share homology to the animal napi family as well as to other organic anion transporters that are members of the anion cation symporter _PROTEIN_ family and share the _PROTEIN_ features of transporters from this family including the presence of putative transmembrane domains and of a amino acid motif in the fourth putative transmembrane domain . _PROTEIN_ thus represent a novel protein of the _LOCATION_ inner envelope that is likely to be involved in anion transport .
napi was initially characterized as a gene _PROTEIN_ in rabbit kidney cells that confers sodium dependant phosphate transport when _PROTEIN_ in xenopus oocytes . further studies have shown that in xenopus oocytes napi acts as anion channel permeable to chloride and organic anions . more recently the caenorhabditis elegans _PROTEIN_ homologue was shown to be involved in glutamatergic neurotransmission while the human homologue has been shown to be a neuronal glutamate transporter that also exhibits a conductance for chloride . another human homologue of napi named ast has been implicated in the transport of sialic acid . we initially selected two _PROTEIN_ sequence tags from arabidopsis that showed homology to the rabbit napi gene . two full length cdnas were subsequently isolated and named _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ for anion transporters . _PROTEIN_ corresponds to the gene _GENE_ while _PROTEIN_ corresponds to the gene _GENE_ . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ share amino acid identity and amino acid similarity . the homology is high throughout the proteins except at the n termini where the sequences are highly divergent . analysis of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ with the blastp program for homology with proteins having a characterized function reveals highest homology with the human and ast the c. elegans _PROTEIN_ and the rabbit napi . alignment of _PROTEIN_ protein with these animal proteins as well as with a rice homologue is shown in fig . . the level of similarity between _PROTEIN_ and the animal homologues ranges from for napi to for or ast with the n terminal hydrophilic domain being poorly conserved for all proteins . all these proteins belong to the anion cation symporter _PROTEIN_ family which itself is included in the major facilitator superfamily . analysis of the hydropathy profiles of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ revealed the presence of putative transmembrane spanning domains separated in two clusters of six domains by a larger hydrophilic stretch a feature common to members of the mfs superfamily . both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ also contain the seven residues that form a characteristic motif present in the members of the _PROTEIN_ family . analysis of the arabidopsis proteins with the chlorop and targetp _METHOD_ revealed a putative chloroplast transit peptide for _PROTEIN_ with a cleavage site between amino acid and . use of the same _METHOD_ for the analysis of _PROTEIN_ gave ambiguous and non conclusive results . the intracellular localization of the _PROTEIN_ protein was examined by organelle and _LOCATION_ fractionation . analysis of the purity of the fractions was tested using antibodies recognizing proteins specific to various _LOCATION_ . antibodies against _PROTEIN_ were raised against a unique amino acid peptide present in the n terminal hydrophilic domain . preliminary analysis by western blotting of fractions derived from arabidopsis leaves and enriched in either _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ tonoplast chloroplast or mitochondria indicated that _PROTEIN_ was _PROTEIN_ a chloroplast protein . subsequent analysis was thus focused on purification and fractionation of the chloroplast . figure shows that _PROTEIN_ protein is enriched in the chloroplast fraction relative to a crude extract from whole shoots . _PROTEIN_ antibodies recognize a single protein of kda . analysis of the chloroplast fractions by western blotting with antibodies raised against the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ protein the tonoplast pyrophosphatase the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ aquaporin _PROTEIN_ and the mitochondrial porin revealed that the chloroplast fraction was depleted of proteins derived from the _LOCATION_ of other organelles . chloroplasts were then fractionated to separate the inner and outer envelopes . the extent of enrichment and contamination of the two fractions were analyzed by western blotting with antibodies against the inner envelope protein _PROTEIN_ the outer envelope protein and the _LOCATION_ protein lhcii . figure shows that _PROTEIN_ is found enriched in the inner envelope fraction and depleted in the outer envelope fraction of arabidopsis chloroplasts . both envelope fractions had undetectable contamination from _LOCATION_ excluding the localization of the _PROTEIN_ protein in these _LOCATION_ . similar results were obtained in experiments with envelopes isolated from spinach chloroplasts . the localization of the _PROTEIN_ protein to the _LOCATION_ inner envelope indicated that the n terminal hydrophilic domain may contain a cleavable transit peptide . analysis of the protein with chlorop and targetp combined with manual inspection of the n terminal hydrophilic domain revealed the presence of two potential cleavage sites one between amino acids and and a second site between and . since the second potential cleavage site is within the peptide that was used for production of antibodies the ability of the antibodies to detect the hydrophilic peptide included between amino acids and of _PROTEIN_ was checked . figure shows that the _PROTEIN_ antibodies can detect the _PROTEIN_ peptide _PROTEIN_ in e.coli while they failed to recognize a peptide representing the mature hydrophilic portion of _PROTEIN_ comprising the region between amino acids and . western analysis of crude extracts from different tissues of arabidopsis was performed with antibodies against _PROTEIN_ . figure shows that _PROTEIN_ is predominantly _PROTEIN_ in leaves _METHOD_ and developing siliques while _PROTEIN_ in roots and flowers was below detection . _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ was further examined in leaves and developing seeds by immunolocalization . cross sections through leaves reveal _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ in both palisade and spongy mesophyll cells . no _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ protein is evident in cells of the leaf epidermis . in to day old siliques containing embryos at the upturned u stages _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ is strongest in the embryo and weak but detectable in the cells of the outer integument endosperm and cells of the silique walls . rabbit antibodies raised against the entire n terminal hydrophilic domain of _PROTEIN_ found to significantly cross react with the _PROTEIN_ n terminal hydrophilic domain of the mature peptide making its use inappropriate for localization of _PROTEIN_ . a hybrid protein was thus created whereby _METHOD_ was translationally fused to the c terminal end of the full length _PROTEIN_ . _METHOD_ and the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ constructs were _PROTEIN_ under the control of the camv promoter and stably transformed into arabidopsis . epidermal peels for the abaxial surface of leaves were examined by _METHOD_ microscopy . while _METHOD_ was found in the cytoplasm and _LOCATION_ but not in _LOCATION_ of epidermal cells of transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ the unfused _METHOD_ the green _METHOD_ was clearly localized in _LOCATION_ in epidermal cells of transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion . these data indicated that _PROTEIN_ was localized to the _LOCATION_ . analysis of the genome of arabidopsis for homologues of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ revealed the presence of four additional genes homologous to _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ namely _GENE_ _PROTEIN_ _GENE_ _PROTEIN_ _GENE_ _PROTEIN_ and _GENE_ _PROTEIN_ . no complete cdnas were available for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . the protein sequences of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were thus deduced using a combination of approaches including the annotation provided in tair or tigr alignment with ests from arabidopsis and other plants as well as alignments with the _PROTEIN_ members for which the annotation has been confirmed with full length cdnas _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . analysis of the gene structure of _PROTEIN_ and comparison with the exon/intron structure of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ led to a predicted protein sequence slightly different from the tair annotation . the difference is _PROTEIN_ due to a selection of splice acceptor sites . although a full length cdna was reported for _PROTEIN_ its structure appeared aberrant since only a short open reading frame is generated . analysis of this sequence indicates an insertion of bases which leads to a change in reading frame and a premature stop codon . the prediction of the _PROTEIN_ protein is thus based on the exon/intron structure of the cdna with the removal of the bases . the alignment of all _PROTEIN_ proteins sequences is shown in fig . level of homology between the various members of the family ranges from amino acid identity and similarity between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ to identity and similarity between _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . the homology between _PROTEIN_ members is lowest at the n terminal hydrophilic region . the _METHOD_ chlorop and targetp both predict a chloroplast targeting sequence for _PROTEIN_ . the predictions with the same _METHOD_ for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are more ambiguous . the structure of the _PROTEIN_ protein appears unusual in that it lacks an extensive n terminal hydrophilic domain common to all other _PROTEIN_ proteins . this indicates that the protein may be located in a different sub cellular compartment compared to other members of the family . the signalp program predicts an anchoring signal peptide at the n terminal end of _PROTEIN_ . the gene structure of _PROTEIN_ is also unusual in that it is composed of a single exon while all other _PROTEIN_ genes are composed of at least eight exons . the various members of the _PROTEIN_ family contain at least five of the seven residues that form the characteristic motif present in the members of the _PROTEIN_ family .
