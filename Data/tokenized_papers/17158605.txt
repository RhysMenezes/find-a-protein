the tonoplast monosaccharide transporter family comprises three _METHOD_ in arabidopsis thaliana and tmt green _METHOD_ protein fusion proteins are targeted to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . tmt promoter _PROTEIN_ plants revealed that the tonoplast monosaccharide _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ genes exhibit a tissue and cell type specific _PROTEIN_ pattern whereas _PROTEIN_ is only weakly _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ is induced by drought salt and cold treatments and by sugar . during cold _PROTEIN_ tmt knockout lines accumulated less _PROTEIN_ and fructose compared with wild type plants whereas no differences were observed for sucrose . cold _PROTEIN_ of wild type plants substantially promoted _PROTEIN_ uptake into isolated leaf mesophyll _LOCATION_ . _PROTEIN_ uptake into isolated _LOCATION_ was inhibited by fructose and phlorizin indicating that transport is energy dependent and that both _PROTEIN_ and fructose were taken up by the same carrier . _PROTEIN_ import into _LOCATION_ from two cold induced _PROTEIN_ knockout lines or from triple knockout plants was substantially lower than into corresponding wild type _LOCATION_ . monosaccharide feeding into leaf discs revealed the strongest response to sugar in _PROTEIN_ knockout lines compared with wild type plants suggesting that _PROTEIN_ is required for _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ homeostasis . our results indicate that _PROTEIN_ is involved in _LOCATION_ monosaccharide transport and plays a major role during stress responses .
during screening of the arabidopsis est library we discovered a cdna clone encoding a carrier exhibiting highest similarity to bacterial monosaccharide transporters . we sequenced the full length clone and named the deduced protein tonoplast monosaccharide _PROTEIN_ . _PROTEIN_ comprises amino acid residues and shows similarity to the bacterial _PROTEIN_ transporter _PROTEIN_ from synechocystis species and similarity to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ located arabidopsis _PROTEIN_ transporter _PROTEIN_ . the substantially lower similarity of _PROTEIN_ to the sucrose transporter _PROTEIN_ further indicates that _PROTEIN_ is a member of the monosaccharide and not the disaccharide transporter family . two additional tmt _METHOD_ have been amplified via pcr from first strand cdna _PROTEIN_ contains amino acid residues and _PROTEIN_ contains amino acid residues . tmt proteins exhibiting substantial structural similarities to the arabidopsis homologs have also been identified in dicotyledonous plants such as medicago and grape vine and in monocotyledonous species such as barley and rice . all members of the tmt protein group exhibit higher structural similarities to prokaryotic hexose carriers than to the plant _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ located and functionally analyzed carriers of the _PROTEIN_ group . _PROTEIN_ exhibits predicted transmembrane domains and shows a uniquely large centrally located hydrophilic loop connecting transmembrane domains and . this loop spans amino acid residues in length which is nearly four to five times larger than the corresponding structures in all other known monosaccharide transporters from prokaryotes and eukaryotes and is not present in the synechocystis homolog . similar to _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ also exhibit an extraordinary long centrally located loop . recently a proteome analysis of the arabidopsis and barley tonoplast indicated the presence of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in this _LOCATION_ . however because proteome analyses might provide false information on the presence of proteins in specific subcellular fractions as a result of contamination from other organelles we used an alternative approach by _PROTEIN_ tmt green _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ fusion proteins in both tobacco protoplasts and arabidopsis cell suspension culture protoplasts . we included _PROTEIN_ in this analysis because in contrast with _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ the third tmt isoform has not been identified in a proteome analysis . figure shows chlorophyll _METHOD_ in chloroplasts present in an isolated tobacco protoplast . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ is clearly distinct from chloroplast _METHOD_ and reveals a tonoplast and not a _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ localization of the fusion protein . this tonoplast localization is indicated because of the large size of the marked _LOCATION_ which appears sporadically indented by chloroplasts and is further substantiated in the merged image . similarly the transient _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in protoplasts from an arabidopsis suspension culture leads to decoration of the tonoplast . the corresponding merged image clearly revealed the thin cytoplasmic space between the labeled tonoplast and the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . as shown for _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ the fusion protein _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ is also located in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ from both transiently transformed arabidopsis suspension culture cells and tobacco protoplasts . rna gel blot hybridization analysis revealed the highest _PROTEIN_ mrna levels in juvenile and adult leaves followed by flower tissues . root and stem tissues accumulated substantially less _PROTEIN_ transcript . by contrast _PROTEIN_ mrna accumulated _PROTEIN_ in root and stem tissues and less in juvenile and adult leaves or in flower tissues . interestingly _PROTEIN_ mrna was not detectable by rna gel blot analysis indicating a very low _PROTEIN_ level . to gain more information on the promoter activity of all three tmt genes we generated _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ promoter _PROTEIN_ plants . figure reveals that the _PROTEIN_ gene is actively transcribed in pollen cells and in all tissues from developing seedlings at d after germination . young leaves from plants grown on soil exhibited slightly higher _PROTEIN_ promoter gus activity than older leaves . _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in flowers is attributable _PROTEIN_ to its _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ filaments and pollen cells still wrapped by anther envelopes . developing seeds still embedded in siliques did not exhibit substantial gus activity . thin cuts of embedded leaves showed that _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ in different cell types . _PROTEIN_ gene _PROTEIN_ is most prominent in mesophyll cells and in cells surrounding the vascular tissue and lower epidermis and is less prominent in the upper epidermis . figure shows that _PROTEIN_ promoter gus activity is relatively low in germinating seedlings or in d old cotyledons . in young roots _PROTEIN_ promoter gus activity was restricted to the stele and in mature leaves only the edge areas showed gus activity . in undeveloped floral side buds in _PROTEIN_ and in filaments _PROTEIN_ promoter gus activity was substantial . _PROTEIN_ mrna was not detectable by rna gel blot analysis . accordingly _PROTEIN_ promoter gus activity was low in all tissues tested . arabidopsis tissues manifesting _PROTEIN_ and/or _PROTEIN_ promoter gus activity such as young leaves and filaments did not exhibit _PROTEIN_ promoter gus activity . only at the very edges of source leaves was a limited _PROTEIN_ promoter gus activity present . in sum we found that _PROTEIN_ promoter gus activity was low in all tissues tested and that _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ promoter gus activities differed in tissue specificity and developmental stage . to obtain information on how different environmental or stress conditions act on tmt gene _PROTEIN_ we analyzed alterations of corresponding mrna levels in response to cold treatment to sugar or salt level and to drought . already after h in the cold mature arabidopsis plants had increased _PROTEIN_ mrna content and after h in the cold _PROTEIN_ mrna reached a maximal level that did not increase further . _PROTEIN_ mrna levels did not respond markedly to cold treatment as there was only a slight increase of _PROTEIN_ mrna after h in the cold compared with the level at the beginning of the experiment . control plants showed exactly the same _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mrna levels as at the beginning of the experiment and cold treatment did not promote the accumulation of _PROTEIN_ mrna above the detection level . the presence of high sugar levels during the growth of arabidopsis in liquid culture medium also affected _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mrna levels . the addition of _PROTEIN_ promoted the accumulation of both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mrna . five percent fructose in the growth medium slightly stimulated _PROTEIN_ but not _PROTEIN_ mrna accumulation and the presence of sucrose led to a higher accumulation of _PROTEIN_ mrna compared with _PROTEIN_ mrna . similar to cold treatment the presence of sugars did not promote the accumulation of _PROTEIN_ mrna above the detection level . when arabidopsis plants were subjected to salt stress by increasing nacl concentrations in the growth medium accumulation of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mrna was observed . however the salt concentrations required to attain the highest _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ transcripts were different mm nacl provoked the highest _PROTEIN_ mrna levels whereas _PROTEIN_ mrna levels attained their maximum at mm nacl . nacl did not promote the accumulation of _PROTEIN_ mrna . drought stress induced by stopping watering of soil grown arabidopsis plants stimulated the accumulation of _PROTEIN_ mrna . seven days after stopping watering _PROTEIN_ transcripts were significantly higher than at the beginning of the experiment or in daily watered control plants . after d of drought treatment _PROTEIN_ mrna accumulated slightly but drought stress did not promote any detectable accumulation of _PROTEIN_ mrna . knockout mutants created by t dna insertions represent a frequently used powerful system to study the physiological function of a protein . a t dna insertion mutant for _PROTEIN_ has been identified in the syngenta library and has been named _PROTEIN_ . the t dna insertion in this mutant is located in exon . the homozygous genotype of the _PROTEIN_ mutation has been confirmed by pcr on genomic dna . rt pcr analysis showed the absence of _PROTEIN_ mrna in the mutant plant . similarly _PROTEIN_ contains a t dna insertion in exon . the homozygous genotype of the _PROTEIN_ mutation has been confirmed by pcr on genomic dna . rt pcr analysis showed the absence of _PROTEIN_ mrna in the mutant . the _PROTEIN_ line contains a t dna insertion in exon . the homozygous genotype of the _PROTEIN_ mutation was confirmed by pcr on genomic dna and rt pcr analysis revealed the absence of _PROTEIN_ mrna in the mutant . finally the _PROTEIN_ contains a t dna insertion in exon . the homozygous genotype of the _PROTEIN_ mutation was confirmed by pcr on genomic dna and rt pcr analysis confirmed the absence of _PROTEIN_ mrna in the mutant . in addition to these single knockout lines we also created double and triple tmt knockout mutants by crossing the single knockout plants . a double knockout line was created by crossing _PROTEIN_ with _PROTEIN_ . rt pcr analysis showed the absence of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mrna in the double mutant . for generation of a triple mutant we crossed the homozygous double mutant with the homozygous _PROTEIN_ line and identified the corresponding mutant lacking all functional tmt genes . rt pcr analysis confirmed the absence of all three tmt mrna species in the triple mutant . none of the mutants mentioned exhibited any distinctive phenotypic features when grown under standard growth conditions . to this point it was impossible to detect _PROTEIN_ transport activity by heterologous _PROTEIN_ of any of the three tmt proteins in bakers or fission yeast mutants lacking endogenous _PROTEIN_ carriers or in pichia pastoris . this result is in agreement with the failure of another research group trying to _PROTEIN_ the sugarcane homolog . although the yeast lines mentioned above exhibited large amounts of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ mrna the corresponding tmt proteins were always absent as revealed using either a his tag specific antibody or an antibody raised against the large hydrophilic loop present in _PROTEIN_ . however we have shown that the _PROTEIN_ gene in particular is strongly induced during cold _PROTEIN_ and is highly responsive upon _PROTEIN_ administration . therefore it was of interest to analyze whether monosaccharide transport into the arabidopsis _LOCATION_ is increased after cold _PROTEIN_ . for this purpose we isolated leaf mesophyll _LOCATION_ either from control wild type plants or from plants transferred for d into the cold before _LOCATION_ isolation . wild type _LOCATION_ isolated from plants grown under standard growth conditions took up nmol _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ after min of incubation whereas _LOCATION_ isolated from wild type plants previously incubated for d at exhibited an internal concentration of nmol _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ after min of incubation . to gain further insight into the biochemical characteristics of tmt catalyzed sugar import we analyzed the effect of ammonium fructose or the sugar transporter inhibitor phlorizin on _PROTEIN_ import into wild type _LOCATION_ . the presence of the protonophore reduced the _PROTEIN_ import rate into isolated _LOCATION_ from cold induced arabidopsis plants by mm fructose inhibited _PROTEIN_ uptake by and mm phlorizin reduced _PROTEIN_ uptake by . higher phlorizin concentrations did not result in any further reduction in _PROTEIN_ uptake . to determine whether the t dna insertion in the _PROTEIN_ gene correlates with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ uptake activity into corresponding _LOCATION_ we compared _PROTEIN_ uptake rates into _LOCATION_ isolated from wild type _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ plants . for this experiment all plant lines were transferred for d into the cold before _LOCATION_ isolation . after min of incubation wild type _LOCATION_ contained nmol _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ whereas _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ had taken up and nmol _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ respectively within the same time . this result reveals that the two independent _PROTEIN_ knockout lines exhibited a substantially reduced capacity to import _PROTEIN_ into the _LOCATION_ . although homolog was the most prominently _PROTEIN_ tmt gene in arabidopsis leaves it was of interest to reveal whether _PROTEIN_ transport into _LOCATION_ isolated from the triple tmt knockout line was _PROTEIN_ further . therefore we isolated _LOCATION_ from cold induced wild type and tmt triple mutant plants and compared the relative _PROTEIN_ uptakes . from figure it is obvious that _PROTEIN_ uptake into triple knockout _LOCATION_ was significantly lower than into wild type _LOCATION_ . however the _PROTEIN_ observed in the triple mutant was not substantially lower than that observed in the two independent _PROTEIN_ knockout lines . under standard growth conditions none of the tmt mutants showed any visible phenotypic difference compared with wild type plants . however because _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are induced in the cold and because _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ transport activity is strongly upregulated during cold incubation we were interested to know whether this observation is also reflected by the leaf sugar content in the chosen growth conditions . under standard growth conditions _PROTEIN_ contents were fresh weight in wild type plants and and fresh weight respectively in the two _PROTEIN_ mutant lines representing slightly reduced _PROTEIN_ contents . a similar reduction was also observed for fructose whereas sucrose contents were very similar in wild type and mutant plants . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ lines grown under standard growth conditions did not exhibit any altered sugar levels compared with wild type plants . the double knockout plant and the triple knockout line showed similarly reduced _PROTEIN_ and fructose levels as the _PROTEIN_ t dna lines when grown under standard conditions whereas the triple mutant contained less _PROTEIN_ and fructose . _PROTEIN_ amounted to and fresh weight in the double and triple mutants respectively and fructose accumulated to and fresh weight in the double and triple mutants respectively . to analyze whether the differences observed for _PROTEIN_ and fructose would be more pronounced during cold stress _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ we transferred wild type and knockout plants into the cold and incubated the plants for h under permanent light . twenty four hours after transfer of wild type plants into the cold _PROTEIN_ accumulated fold to a concentration of fresh weight fructose accumulated to fresh weight and sucrose doubled to fresh weight . however in both knockout lines the changes in monosaccharides differed markedly from the corresponding changes in wild type leaves . twenty four hours after transfer into the cold _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ leaves contained only and _PROTEIN_ fresh weight respectively . fructose accumulated in both knockout lines to only and fresh weight respectively . interestingly under cold stress conditions the double tmt mutant contained significantly less hexose compared with the single _PROTEIN_ t dna insertion lines _PROTEIN_ . upon cold stress the triple mutant contained _PROTEIN_ and fructose levels similar to concentrations observed in the double mutant namely fresh weight _PROTEIN_ and fresh weight fructose . in contrast with the two _PROTEIN_ knockout mutants the double and triple mutants also showed slightly reduced sucrose levels upon h of cold stress . an impaired _PROTEIN_ transport into the _LOCATION_ may lead to increased _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ concentrations and thus affect _PROTEIN_ regulated genes . the _PROTEIN_ binding gene and nitrate _PROTEIN_ represent sugar regulated plant genes . therefore these two genes are suitable candidates to test whether _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ contents are altered in _PROTEIN_ mutants because if this is the case altered transcript levels should be observed . for this analysis leaf discs from to week old plants were prepared h after the onset of illumination and subsequently incubated for h in the dark in the presence of various sugars . dark incubation was chosen to prevent photosynthesis driven sugar accumulation . subsequently total rna from leaf discs was isolated and rna gel blot hybridization was conducted to quantify the levels of cab mrna and _PROTEIN_ mrna . at the beginning of the incubation experiment leaves from wild type and the two independent knockout plants contained very similar levels of cab and _PROTEIN_ mrna respectively . wild type leaf discs incubated in the presence of _PROTEIN_ fructose or sorbitol showed no obvious _PROTEIN_ of cab mrna compared with the h control whereas sucrose provoked a _PROTEIN_ of cab mrna . interestingly in both _PROTEIN_ knockout lines the sugars _PROTEIN_ fructose and sucrose induced a significantly stronger _PROTEIN_ of cab mrna compared with the corresponding wild type leaf discs . the levels of _PROTEIN_ mrna in wild type leaf discs incubated in sugars were higher than those in leaf discs incubated in water . this observation concurs with the known sugar induction of the _PROTEIN_ gene . however each of the sugars tested provoked a stronger stimulatory effect upon the _PROTEIN_ gene in leaf discs prepared from _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ plants .
arabidopsis thaliana plants were grown in a growth chamber in soil at and light was present at for h/d . for cold stress induction plants were grown for weeks in the growth chamber and subsequently transferred for h into a cooled growth chamber . drought stress was applied to week old plants by withholding water for up to d. for salt stress analysis surface sterilized seeds were sown on agar plates containing half strength _METHOD_ salts agar sucrose mes and various nacl concentrations . before germination plates were incubated at for d in the dark and subsequently transferred to the growth chamber and growth was continued for d under short day conditions . to study the effect of sugars on gene _PROTEIN_ wild type or mutant seedlings were grown for d in liquid half strength _METHOD_ medium containing mes and _PROTEIN_ fructose or sucrose if indicated . multiple alignments of protein sequences were performed with the program clustalx . transmembrane domains were predicted by the program soap in pcgene . to construct the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion proteins we first amplified the entire _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ cdnas by pcr using the pfu dna polymerase . the primers used for _PROTEIN_ were the sense primer ml and the antisense primer ml _PROTEIN_ . for the _PROTEIN_ construct the primers used were the sense primer _PROTEIN_ and the antisense primer . the obtained dna fragments were cleaved with xbai and xhoi respectively and inserted in frame in front of the _METHOD_ coding region using the vector _METHOD_ leading to the final _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ constructs under the control of a promoter . protoplasts isolated from sterile grown tobacco were transformed with column purified plasmid dna as given . after d of incubation at in the dark protoplasts in petri dishes were checked for the presence of green _METHOD_ by use of a laser scanning system _PROTEIN_ . _METHOD_ was excited at nm and the emission was detected by a photomultiplier through a to nm band pass filter using an achroplan objective . alternatively cells from an arabidopsis cell suspension culture were transiently transformed with column purified plasmid dna . the fusion constructs were introduced into arabidopsis protoplasts by polyethylene glycol mediated transformation . _PROTEIN_ of the fusion constructs was monitored at various times after transformation by confocal laser scanning microscopy using a leica dm _PROTEIN_ microscope with a plan apochromat oil immersion objective coupled to a tcs spectral confocal and multiphoton microscope _METHOD_ . images were processed with the leica confocal software . the arabidopsis knockout mutants _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were kindly provided by the torrey mesa research institute . a second independent _PROTEIN_ knockout line _PROTEIN_ was bought from the gabi kat consortium and a third knockout mutant _PROTEIN_ was provided by the salk library . to generate double knockout mutants _PROTEIN_ lacking _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ transporter genes homozygous _PROTEIN_ and homozygous _PROTEIN_ mutants were crossed . to obtain a null mutant _PROTEIN_ lacking all three functional tmt genes the homozygous double knockout plants were crossed with a homozygous _PROTEIN_ mutant . all knockout lines were analyzed by rt pcr for the absence of the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ transcript respectively caused by t dna insertions . total leaf rna from plants grown in the growth chamber was extracted using the rneasy kit . subsequently dnase treated rna was transcribed into cdna via reverse transcriptase . with the cdna as template pcr was performed with cycles of for s for min and for min finishing with an extension at for min . rt pcr products were checked on agarose gels . the following gene specific primers were used for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and . the full length _PROTEIN_ cdna clone derived from the arabidopsis est project was cloned according to standard protocols . for the analysis of sugar induced molecular responses we quantified the levels of mrnas encoding _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . the full length cdnas for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ were amplified using a first strand cdna preparation as template and the amplification products were cloned into the plasmid pbsk and sequenced . for the generation of the promoter gus constructs the binary vector pgptv containing the _PROTEIN_ gene from escherichia coli was used . for the generation of the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ promoter gus fusions a promoter region of kb was cloned upstream of the gus gene . for the generation of the _PROTEIN_ promoter gus fusion a region of bp was cloned . the promoter regions of the tmt genes were amplified by pcr from genomic dna and were sequenced to check that the correct product was amplified . for amplification of the promoter regions the following primers were used for _PROTEIN_ and for _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ and for _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ for and _PROTEIN_ rev . after blunt end ligation of the pcr products in the orientation into the smai restricted pbsk vector the _PROTEIN_ construct was restricted with hindiii and smai the _PROTEIN_ promoter was restricted with sali and smai and the _PROTEIN_ construct was restricted with sali and pvuii and subsequently inserted in frame with the gus gene . the resulting constructs were used for agrobacterium tumefaciens transformation . transformation of arabidopsis was conducted according to the floral dip method . whole seedlings _METHOD_ and other tissues from transgenic plants grown on soil under standard growth conditions were collected in ice cold acetone . after min of incubation at room temperature samples were stained according to standard protocols . from each construct we analyzed to independent lines and representative results are presented . to analyze the effects of sugars on the levels of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ mrnas in wild type and knockout mutant plants we prepared leaf discs from plants grown for to weeks in the growth chamber . three hours after illumination discs were either transferred directly into liquid nitrogen or incubated for h in either water or water supplemented with the indicated solutes . incubation took place in petri dishes in the dark at room temperature . to prevent anaerobic conditions samples were incubated on a laboratory shaker at rpm during incubation . leaf discs used for rna extraction were frozen and stored in liquid nitrogen until rna extraction . the relative accumulation of tmt mrna was analyzed in different arabidopsis tissues prepared from plants grown in the growth chamber . tissues were harvested and immediately transferred into liquid nitrogen . total sample rna was extracted using the purescript rna extraction kit _METHOD_ . rna gel blot hybridization was performed as described . labeling of probes was performed using the ready to go random prime kit . after hybridization the _LOCATION_ were washed according to standard procedures and blots were visualized with a cyclon phosphor imager . for isolation of intact arabidopsis _LOCATION_ wild type or knockout mutant plants were grown for to weeks under standard growth conditions . if not stated otherwise plants were grown for d at before _LOCATION_ isolation . isolation of _LOCATION_ was performed as described previously . essentially mesophyll protoplasts were enriched by enzymatic digestion and centrifugation and corresponding _LOCATION_ were isolated after mild hypoosmotic treatment of protoplasts . because enzymatic digestion has to occur for h at room temperature we incubated the resulting protoplasts from cold _PROTEIN_ plants subsequently for h on ice _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ . we showed elsewhere that arabidopsis _LOCATION_ essentially isolated according to this protocol do not contain other cellular organelles or intact protoplasts . we checked that intermediate cold incubation of enriched protoplasts before _LOCATION_ isolation did not alter the purity of the final _LOCATION_ preparation . transport studies of _PROTEIN_ into isolated _LOCATION_ were performed using the silicone oil centrifugation technique . transport was conducted for min and terminated by centrifugation of intact _LOCATION_ through a layer of silicone oil . radioactively labeled _PROTEIN_ was given at a concentration of and _PROTEIN_ was given to energize isolated _LOCATION_ . sugar extraction from arabidopsis leaves and spectroscopic quantification were performed as described by citation . genbank/embl accession numbers and arabidopsis genome initiative locus identifiers for the genes mentioned in this article are as follows
