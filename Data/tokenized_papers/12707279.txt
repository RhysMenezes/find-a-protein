the sequencing of the genome of arabidopsis thaliana revealed that this plant contained numerous _METHOD_ of thioredoxin a protein involved in thiol disulfide exchanges . on the basis of sequence comparison seven putative chloroplastic trxs have been identified four belonging to the m type two belonging to the f type and one belonging to a new x type . in the present work these _METHOD_ were produced and purified as recombinant proteins without their putative transit peptides . their activities were tested with two known chloroplast thioredoxin targets nadp malate dehydrogenase and fructose bisphosphatase and also with a chloroplastic cys peroxiredoxin . the study _METHOD_ the strict specificity of fructose bisphosphatase for trx f reveals that some trxs are unable to activate nadp malate dehydrogenase and shows that the new x type is the most efficient substrate for peroxiredoxin while being inactive toward the two other targets . this suggests that this isoform might be specifically involved in resistance against oxidative stress . three dimensional modeling shows that one of the m type trxs trx which has no activity with any of the three targets exhibits a negatively charged surface surrounding the active site . a green _METHOD_ protein approach _METHOD_ the _LOCATION_ localization of these trxs .
production and purification of recombinant the seven putative cptrxs were produced in their predicted mature form . they were purified to homogeneity by standard methods however the purification of trxs and required an additional hplc step because they eluted close to e. coli trx . a standard test to detect plant trxs is their capacity to activate nadp _PROTEIN_ as this enzyme is considered to exhibit little specificity . however during purification of trxs and x this test proved useless and the proteins had to be detected by their low molecular _METHOD_ . to ascertain whether these trxs were able to reduce protein disulfide bonds their activity was checked with the standard insulin test . trx x displayed an activity very similar to that of m type trxs . trx although less active was more efficient than dtt . thus each trx was produced in a redox active form . activation of nadp _PROTEIN_ estimate the specificity of nadp _PROTEIN_ for cptrxs the and the of nadp _PROTEIN_ activation measured at the trx concentration were determined . the highest efficiency was displayed by trx followed by trxs and . confirming our previous observation trx had a very poor affinity for nadp _PROTEIN_ if any as the enzyme could not be fully activated even at a concentration . trx x was also a poor activator of nadp _PROTEIN_ with an about fold higher than the for other trxs . the was about min for trxs and and a few minutes for trxs and . trx showed a of more than min . very slow activation rates were observed for trxs and x thus the could not be determined . this lack of activity was quite unexpected . we have shown previously that the redox potential of the c terminal disulfide of nadp _PROTEIN_ was more negative than the redox potential of the disulfide of standard m and f trxs by mv requiring an excess of reduced trx for reduction . in contrast the n terminal disulfide is almost isopotential with trxs . to check whether a difference in redox potentials might be the cause of the inefficiency of trxs x and we tested the ability of these two trxs to activate a mutant nadp _PROTEIN_ where only the n terminal disulfide remains _PROTEIN_ . this mutated enzyme exhibits some basal activity in the oxidized form but requires reduced trx to reach full activation . the mutant nadp _PROTEIN_ could be activated to some extent by trxs and x although at a markedly slower rate than with trx . the activity of trx was particularly low . redox potential result obtained for the mutant nadp _PROTEIN_ suggested that trxs and x might have less negative redox potentials than the other trxs . the determination of the redox potentials of the different trxs supported this hypothesis only in the case of trx x . in _PROTEIN_ the em values of most trxs were similar around an average value of mv at ph . the em value of trx x was significantly less negative . activation of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ are known to be activated very specifically by trx f. our results confirmed this specificity only f type attrxs could significantly activate the enzyme . this result is supported by the determination of and . trxs m and x were so inefficient that neither nor could be estimated . trxs and had similar low and values . this result _METHOD_ that f type trxs are the specific activators of _PROTEIN_ both _METHOD_ being equally efficient . reduction of chloroplastic cys trx dependent cys chloroplastic peroxidase has been identified recently but its specificity for cptrxs has not been extensively tested . this prx uses reduced trx as a proton donating substrate for hydrogen peroxide and alkyl hydroperoxide reduction . the capacity of the various cptrxs to reduce cys prx from a. thaliana was compared by measuring the rates of disappearance of t booh in the presence of trx . in this test trx x proved to be by far the most efficient . most m type trxs and f type trxs seemed to be reasonably efficient but trx showed no activity . the determination of kinetic parameters allowed the classification of trxs into two distinct groups . trxs and had substantially lower kcat values than those of trxs f and x . the km value was the lowest for trx x . the differences in catalytic efficiencies highlighted this selectivity the value for trx x ranging from fold higher to fold higher . based on all three parameters trx x was indeed the best substrate for prx . trxs and had a very low or no efficiency . subcellular localization of putative already stated our seven arabidopsis trxs possess transit peptides and are predicted to be chloroplastic . however given the unusual biochemical properties of some of them we used modified versions of _METHOD_ to confirm the subcellular localization of one member of each type . for this purpose the sequences encoding the preproteins corresponding to trxs and x were translationally fused upstream of _METHOD_ cdna and transient _PROTEIN_ of the chimeric sequences were monitored in a. thaliana protoplasts by confocal microscopy . in addition trx in its mature form and trx in its preprotein form were n terminally fused to _METHOD_ as controls for respectively absence of targeting and mitochondrial targeting . as shown in supplemental fig . for the four transit peptide containing cptrxs _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was observed inside the _LOCATION_ . mature trx failed in this targeting . referring to the picture obtained for mitochondrial targeting of _METHOD_ when fused to trx none of the cptrxs was able to address the fused _METHOD_ protein to mitochondria . taking into account the high sequence identity between trxs and on one hand and trxs and on the other of hand the conclusion obtained for one representative of each type of cptrx should apply to the other members of the group .
