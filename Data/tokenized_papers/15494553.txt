agrobacterium tumefaciens uses a type iv secretion system to transfer t dna and virulence proteins to plants . the is composed of two major structural components the t pilus and a _LOCATION_ associated complex that is responsible for translocating substrates across both bacterial _LOCATION_ . protein is the major component of the t pilus . we used the c terminal processed portion of protein as a bait to screen an arabidopsis thaliana cdna library for proteins that interact with in yeast . we identified three related plant proteins interacting protein _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ with unknown functions and a _LOCATION_ associated _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . the three bti proteins also interacted with in vitro . preincubation of agrobacterium with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ protein _PROTEIN_ the transformation efficiency of arabidopsis suspension cells by agrobacterium . transgenic bti and _PROTEIN_ antisense and rna interference arabidopsis plants are less susceptible to transformation by agrobacterium than are wild type plants . the level of _PROTEIN_ protein is transiently increased immediately after agrobacterium infection . in addition overexpression of _PROTEIN_ protein in transgenic arabidopsis results in plants that are hypersusceptible to agrobacterium mediated transformation . confocal microscopic data indicate that _METHOD_ bti proteins preferentially localize to the periphery of root cells in transgenic arabidopsis plants suggesting that bti proteins may contact the agrobacterium t pilus . we propose that the three bti proteins and _PROTEIN_ are involved in the initial interaction of agrobacterium with plant cells .
we constructed a bait plasmid as a translational fusion of processed fused to the lexa coding sequence of the plasmid . alone was unable to activate transcription of the lacz reporter gene in yeast strain . we introduced into an arabidopsis cdna library and screened for blue colonies on selective medium containing x gal . we screened prey plasmids from positive colonies for interaction with the unrelated bait plasmid psst lamin and eliminated these interacting clones from consideration . from primary transformants we identified and sequenced remaining prey plasmids . based on dna sequence analysis and blastx search results we recurrently identified two classes of plant proteins . the first class contains the interacting proteins composed of a three member family of previously unknown function _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ the second class is the ras related small _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . we further examined whether bti and _PROTEIN_ proteins interact with a minor component of the t pilus and with other virulence proteins and virf . supplemental figure online shows that the plant proteins _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ interact in yeast only with but not with or virf . the c terminal amino acid regions of from octopine and nopaline type ti plasmids are nearly identical . consequently the three bti and _PROTEIN_ proteins interact with both of these proteins in yeast . in addition we tested interactions in yeast among the _PROTEIN_ and bti proteins . as shown in figure the three bti proteins interacted with each other and with _METHOD_ . _PROTEIN_ as a bait interacts with all three bti proteins but not with itself . these results suggest that the bti and _PROTEIN_ proteins may form a complex in the plant cell . however _PROTEIN_ as a prey protein did not interact with the bti proteins . these findings may result from different conformations of the bait and prey fusion proteins in yeast as previously reported for interactions between and . to determine whether interacts directly with the bti proteins we performed glutathione s transferase _PROTEIN_ pull down assays using a _PROTEIN_ fusion protein . we incubated lysates from e. coli _PROTEIN_ tagged bti proteins with a _PROTEIN_ fusion protein that had been linked to glutathione sepharose beads . after extensive washing bound proteins were eluted and used for protein gel blot analyses with anti tag antibodies . as a negative control _PROTEIN_ linked to the glutathione column was similarly treated with tagged proteins . figure shows the results of these experiments . all three bti proteins interacted with the _PROTEIN_ fusion protein but not _PROTEIN_ in vitro . these data confirm direct interaction of protein with the three bti proteins . recombinant _PROTEIN_ was highly insoluble when fused to a tag we therefore did not investigate its in vitro interaction with . to investigate further the in vitro interactions among these interacting plant proteins we linked _PROTEIN_ fusions of each of the bti proteins and _PROTEIN_ to glutathione sepharose beads and incubated them with lysates from e. coli _PROTEIN_ tagged versions of the various bti proteins . figure shows that the three bti proteins interacted with each other and with _METHOD_ in vitro . in addition all three tagged bti proteins interacted with either the _PROTEIN_ or gdp form of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ . these data indicate that each of the three bti proteins can interact with _METHOD_ and with _PROTEIN_ in vitro and further suggest the possibility that these proteins may form a complex in plants . figure shows that the three bti proteins share amino acid similarity . all three proteins contain a c terminal to amino acid reticulon homology domain comprising two large hydrophobic regions with an amino acid loop in between as determined by the blastp and rpsblast _METHOD_ . based on protein sequence analyses using the prediction of transmembrane regions and orientation program the three bti proteins have two or three putative transmembrane domains . to determine which domain of _PROTEIN_ is involved in the interaction between _PROTEIN_ and we generated a series of _PROTEIN_ protein deletion mutants and performed yeast two hybrid assays using these truncated _PROTEIN_ proteins as preys and processed protein as a bait . the _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutant containing only the first seven amino acids of _PROTEIN_ served as a negative control . of the nine truncated _PROTEIN_ proteins tested only mutant _PROTEIN_ e interacted with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . control experiments indicated that the various _PROTEIN_ mutant proteins were _PROTEIN_ in yeast . these results indicate that only the c terminal hydrophilic region is dispensable for interaction between _PROTEIN_ and the other proteins tested either because direct interactions do not involve this c terminal region or because deletion of the other domains result in conformational changes in _PROTEIN_ that no longer permit interaction . if _PROTEIN_ protein directly binds to in the t pilus we should be able to inhibit plant transformation by saturating the t pilus with _PROTEIN_ protein before cocultivation of the bacteria with plant cells . to test this hypothesis we first induced _PROTEIN_ in agrobacterium with acetosyringone then incubated the induced cells with none or increasing concentrations of recombinant _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ or _PROTEIN_ . we subsequently used these bacteria to infect arabidopsis suspension cells . figure shows that incubating agrobacterium with increasing amounts of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ inhibited transformation in a concentration dependent manner . when induced agrobacterium cells were preincubated with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ of the arabidopsis suspension cells were transformed compared with of the suspension cells that were transformed in the absence of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ protein or in the presence of _PROTEIN_ . we further tested whether _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ protein affects the viability of agrobacterium . after h cocultivation the number of viable agrobacterium cells incubated with _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ did not differ from that of bacteria incubated with _PROTEIN_ or without recombinant protein . these data indicate that the lower transformation efficiency of arabidopsis suspension cells results from inhibition of infection by _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ rather than a toxic effect of the recombinant protein on bacterial viability . to determine if _PROTEIN_ protein plays an important role in agrobacterium mediated plant transformation we generated arabidopsis plants with a _PROTEIN_ level of _PROTEIN_ gene _PROTEIN_ and subsequently tested them for susceptibility to agrobacterium mediated transformation . figures and show the results of transformation assays for _PROTEIN_ antisense and rnai transgenic plants respectively . when we infected root segments with the tumorigenic strain agrobacterium the a/s and rnai transgenic plants formed tumors at an efficiency two to fivefold lower than that of wild type plants . figures and show root tumorigenesis assays on sets of representative plates . we performed additional stable transformation assays to test the formation of phosphinothricin resistant calli on the roots of transgenic _PROTEIN_ a/s plants after infection with agrobacterium that contains a bar gene on the incoming t dna . these transgenic _PROTEIN_ a/s plants formed ppt resistant calli at a two to fold lower efficiency compared with that of wild type plants . figure shows herbicide resistance assays on sets of representative plates . a plant resistant to agrobacterium mediated transformation may have transformation blocked at a step inside the _LOCATION_ such as t dna integration or at a step before _LOCATION_ import . we therefore tested the susceptibility of the _PROTEIN_ a/s and rnai transgenic plants to transient transformation . such transformation does not require integration of t dna into the plant genome . when infected by agrobacterium harboring a t dna carrying a gusa intron reporter gene _PROTEIN_ the a/s and rnai transgenic plants showed a two to threefold reduction in transient transformation frequency compared with that of wild type plants as indicated by staining for gus activity using x _PROTEIN_ . these data suggest that transformation of these transgenic plants may be blocked at an early stage such as bacterial attachment t dna and vir protein transfer and/or _LOCATION_ import of t dna and vir proteins . to investigate whether the transformation resistance phenotypes correspond to _PROTEIN_ transcript levels of the genes targeted by antisense rna or rnai in these transgenic plants we examined the transcript levels of _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ in _PROTEIN_ a/s and rnai transgenic plants using rt pcr with gene specific primers . figures and show that in both _PROTEIN_ a/s and rnai transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ transcript levels are lower than those in wild type plants . because _PROTEIN_ transcripts share sequence similarity with _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ transcripts _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ transcript levels are also affected by antisense and rnai constructions targeting _PROTEIN_ transcripts . to examine further the _PROTEIN_ levels of _PROTEIN_ protein in the _PROTEIN_ a/s and rnai transgenic plants we performed protein gel blot analysis on protein extracts from root tissues of arabidopsis plants using an antibody directed against _PROTEIN_ protein . amino acid residues to of _PROTEIN_ protein were chosen to synthesize peptide . this sequence was chosen from a region that is highly variable among the three bti proteins and does not correspond to the conserved reticulon domain . anti _PROTEIN_ antibody does not cross react with recombinant _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ protein and only slightly cross reacts with _PROTEIN_ protein . protein gel blot analysis demonstrated that _PROTEIN_ protein levels are greatly reduced in _PROTEIN_ a/s and rnai transgenic plants in comparison with those found in wild type plants . the reduction in _PROTEIN_ protein levels in the various transgenic lines is relatively the same as is the reduction in _PROTEIN_ transcript levels in these plants and correlates with the _PROTEIN_ in their transformation susceptibility . it should be noted however that in some _PROTEIN_ a/s and rnai transgenic plants the antisense or rnai constructions targeted against the _PROTEIN_ mrna additionally affected the level of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ transcripts . thus it is possible that the resistance phenotype of some of these transgenic plants may result from lower _PROTEIN_ of more than one bti gene . to determine the extent to which the _PROTEIN_ gene alone is involved in the agrobacterium mediated transformation process we identified two t dna insertions in the _PROTEIN_ gene . the first insertion _PROTEIN_ in ecotype ws is located bp upstream of the start codon of the _PROTEIN_ gene . we tested the susceptibility of _PROTEIN_ mutant plants to stable transformation . _PROTEIN_ mutants showed lower levels of tumor formation and formed fewer ppt resistant calli than did wild type plants . tumors that formed on wild type roots were _PROTEIN_ green teratomas whereas tumors that formed on _PROTEIN_ mutant plants were generally smaller yellow tumors with a few small green tumors . we also performed transient transformation assays on _PROTEIN_ mutant plants and found that _PROTEIN_ mutants were less susceptible than were wild type plants . these data suggest that _PROTEIN_ mutants may be blocked at an early stage of transformation . protein gel blot analysis indicated that the level of _PROTEIN_ protein is lower in _PROTEIN_ plants compared with that of wild type plants and only the _PROTEIN_ transcript level but not the _PROTEIN_ transcript level is affected by the t dna insertion . these data suggest that disruption of the _PROTEIN_ promoter region results in a lower level of _PROTEIN_ gene _PROTEIN_ and a concomitant _PROTEIN_ in agrobacterium mediated transformation . analysis of another t dna insertion in _PROTEIN_ salk _PROTEIN_ similarly showed lower _PROTEIN_ protein levels and transformation efficiency compared with that of wild type plants . the results of stable and transient transformation assays with two independent _PROTEIN_ t dna insertion lines indicate that the rat phenotypes correlate with reduced _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ gene . additionally in a/s _PROTEIN_ transgenic plants _PROTEIN_ transcript levels are relatively low whereas _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ transcript levels are approximately the same as in wild type plants . taken together these data suggest that _PROTEIN_ protein is involved in the agrobacterium transformation process . _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ proteins interact with in yeast and in vitro . in addition the three bti proteins interact with each other and with _METHOD_ suggesting that bti proteins may form a complex . because no _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ t dna exon insertion mutants were available we generated transgenic _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ a/s and rnai plants and tested their susceptibility to agrobacterium mediated transformation . figures and as well as supplemental tables and online indicate that inhibition of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ also results in a rat phenotype . because of sequence similarity among the three bti genes both _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ transcript levels are affected by the _PROTEIN_ antisense and rnai constructions in some of the _PROTEIN_ a/s and rnai transgenic plants . in _PROTEIN_ a/s and rnai plants _PROTEIN_ transcript levels _PROTEIN_ more than that of _PROTEIN_ . because the _PROTEIN_ cdna sequence is divergent from that of the _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ cdna sequences _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ transcript levels are less affected by the _PROTEIN_ rnai construction . the resistance phenotypes of the _PROTEIN_ a/s and rnai transgenic plants correlate with reduced _PROTEIN_ of the _PROTEIN_ gene . similarly in _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ rnai transgenic plants the resistance phenotypes are correlated with reduced levels of _PROTEIN_ transcripts . however in some of the _PROTEIN_ a/s _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ rnai transgenic plants the resistance phenotype may result from reduced _PROTEIN_ of two or three of the bti genes . because _PROTEIN_ protein interacts with in yeast we generated transgenic _PROTEIN_ a/s and rnai plants to investigate the involvement of _PROTEIN_ in the agrobacterium mediated transformation process . figures and as well as supplemental tables and online indicate that reduction in _PROTEIN_ of _PROTEIN_ also results in reduced transformation efficiency . infection of tobacco and arabidopsis cells by transfer competent agrobacterium strains induces the _PROTEIN_ of numerous plant genes . to determine if agrobacterium infection affects _PROTEIN_ protein _PROTEIN_ we separately infected arabidopsis suspension cell cultures with three different agrobacterium strains . each strain contained the binary vector to monitor transformation efficiency by examining gus activity in the infected arabidopsis cells . agrobacterium can transfer both t dna and vir proteins to plant cells . agrobacterium contains but lacks a ti plasmid this strain can not produce nor transfer t dna or vir proteins to plants . agrobacterium contains a ti plasmid lacking a t dna region . although this strain can not transfer t dna it can export and virf proteins via the transport apparatus . additionally we examined uninfected arabidopsis suspension cells . we sampled uninfected arabidopsis cells and cells separately cocultivated with the various agrobacterium strains from three independent infections . the average transformation efficiency using agrobacterium was . we monitored _PROTEIN_ protein levels by protein gel blot analysis and normalized the amount of _PROTEIN_ protein in each sample to the amount of actin . figure shows the _PROTEIN_ profiles of _PROTEIN_ protein for each of the four treatments . when arabidopsis suspension cell cultures were infected with _PROTEIN_ protein levels increased by almost fold h after the start of cocultivation after which _PROTEIN_ protein amounts gradually declined during the h cocultivation period . arabidopsis suspension cell cultures infected with agrobacterium or did not show a similar transient increase in _PROTEIN_ protein . these results suggest that the transient increase of _PROTEIN_ protein levels after infection results from t dna but not vir protein transfer and does not occur merely because of contact of the plant with agrobacterium cells . to determine if overexpression of _PROTEIN_ protein in plants could enhance the efficiency of agrobacterium mediated transformation we generated transgenic arabidopsis plants that overexpress _PROTEIN_ protein and performed transformation assays on them . protein gel blot analysis indicated that many of these plants markedly overproduce _PROTEIN_ protein compared with wild type plants . figures and show the results of stable and transient transformation assays . when root segments from wild type arabidopsis plants and transgenic _PROTEIN_ overexpressing plants were infected with various agrobacterium strains the _PROTEIN_ overexpressing plants showed a twofold to threefold increase in transformation efficiency . rt pcr analysis indicated that the three bti genes are _PROTEIN_ in roots rosette leaves and inflorescence tissues of wild type arabidopsis plants . we investigated further the tissues in which _PROTEIN_ protein is _PROTEIN_ . protein gel blot analyses using antibodies directed against _PROTEIN_ protein revealed that _PROTEIN_ protein accumulates in roots rosette leaves and the bolt regions of the inflorescence from mature arabidopsis plants but not in siliques flowers or caluine leaves . _PROTEIN_ protein is also _PROTEIN_ in arabidopsis suspension cells . figure shows that as a percentage of total protein _PROTEIN_ is _PROTEIN_ at relatively high levels in root tissues compared with other plant tissues . it is not clear whether the t pilus penetrates the plant cell wall and _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ or if the t pilus attaches to or fuses with the plant cell surface during agrobacterium infection . if bti proteins interact with protein in the t pilus they should localize to the plant cell surface . to address this issue we fused bti protein with _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ this fusion protein in transgenic arabidopsis plants . because _PROTEIN_ protein is _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ in the root tissues and we have used root tissues to perform transformation assays we choose roots from _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgenic plants to perform further analyses . confocal microscopic analysis indicated that _METHOD_ alone is found throughout both the cytoplasm and the _LOCATION_ whereas _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein localizes throughout the cytoplasm but preferentially to the periphery of root tip cells . similar results were obtained with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgenic plants . we additionally treated root tissues from _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ transgenic plants with m mannitol for to min . after such treatment the plant cell dehydrates and the cytoplasm along with the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ separates from the cell wall . figure shows that after such mild plasmolysis _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ is predominantly in the cytoplasmic region and does not associate with the cell wall . these results indicate that as predicted by the presence of putative _LOCATION_ spanning domains _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion protein does not localize to the plant cell wall .

cocktail from sigma . crude plant protein extracts were isolated following the manufacturer 's instructions . the final protein concentrations were determined using a bca protein assay kit and spectroscopy . equal amounts of plant proteins were loaded on _PROTEIN_ polyacrylamide gels and protein gel blot analyses were performed using a dilution of peptide raised _PROTEIN_ antibody to determine the _PROTEIN_ protein level in _PROTEIN_ a/s _PROTEIN_ rnai _PROTEIN_ overexpression _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ mutant plants and wild type arabidopsis plants . in addition we used antibodies against actin at a dilution to perform protein gel blot analyses to normalize plant protein amounts . the _LOCATION_ were developed with a chemiluminescent detection method and subjected to autoradiography . the protein bands on the x ray _METHOD_ were visualized with a uvp bioimaging system and quantified using labworks software . the protein sequence from amino acid residues to of _PROTEIN_ was chosen to generate peptide . this peptide was injected into the two individual rabbits to raise polyclonal antibodies . seven day old arabidopsis suspension cell cultures were separately infected with three agrobacterium strains . agrobacterium cells were prepared and used to infect arabidopsis suspension cell cultures as described above . cocultivation of agrobacterium cells with arabidopsis suspension cell cultures were performed at to with gentle shaking for various time periods . at each time point plant cells were pelleted by centrifugation at rpm and washed two times in arabidopsis suspension cell medium containing timentin followed by protein isolation . three independent infection experiments were performed for each treatment . crude protein extracts were isolated and protein concentrations were determined as described above . equal amounts of crude protein extract were loaded on _PROTEIN_ polyacrylamide gels and protein gel blot analyses were performed with a dilution of peptide raised anti _PROTEIN_ antibodies to determine the _PROTEIN_ protein levels in infected arabidopsis suspension cells at different time points . the _LOCATION_ were developed by a chemiluminescent detection method and subjected to autoradiography . additionally we used antibodies against actin at a dilution to perform protein gel blot analyses to normalize plant protein amounts in each crude protein extract . protein gel blot analyses results were obtained and analyzed as described above . the coding sequences of the three bti genes generated by pcr were cloned as xbai bglii fragments into these same sites of the t dna binary vector . the pcr reaction was performed in a reaction volume using two units of high fidelity pwo dna polymerase with a mm dntp mixture pwo polymerase reaction buffer and with of the following primers forward primer for _PROTEIN_ gene _PROTEIN_ reverse primer for _PROTEIN_ gene gaagatcttatctttcttcttgttctt forward primer for _PROTEIN_ gene
