the processing of n linked oligosaccharides in the secretory pathway requires the sequential action of a number of glycosidases and glycosyltransferases . we studied the spatial distribution of several type ii _LOCATION_ bound enzymes from glycine max arabidopsis thaliana and nicotiana tabacum . _PROTEIN_ i localized to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ mannosidase i and n acetylglucosaminyltransferase i _PROTEIN_ both targeted to the _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ and xylosyltransferase localized exclusively to _LOCATION_ stacks corresponding to the order of expected function . mani deletion constructs revealed that the mani transmembrane domain contains all necessary targeting information . likewise _PROTEIN_ truncations showed that this could apply to other type ii enzymes . a green _METHOD_ protein chimera with mani tmd lengthened by duplicating its last seven amino acids localized exclusively to the _LOCATION_ and colocalized with a trans _LOCATION_ marker _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ suggesting roles for protein lipid interactions in mani targeting . however the tmd lengths of other plant glycosylation enzymes indicate that this mechanism can not apply to all enzymes in the pathway . in _PROTEIN_ removal of the first amino acids of the gcsi cytoplasmic tail resulted in relocalization from the _LOCATION_ to the _LOCATION_ suggesting a targeting mechanism relying on protein protein interactions . we conclude that the localization of n glycan processing enzymes corresponds to an assembly line in the early secretory pathway and depends on both tmd length and signals in the cytoplasmic tail .
to better understand the _METHOD_ allowing the selective retention of n glycan processing enzymes in the early _LOCATION_ compartments the localization of a series of _METHOD_ fusions to four different members of the n glycan processing machinery _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ was studied after stable _PROTEIN_ in tobacco by cells . _METHOD_ of a full length mani _METHOD_ fusion construct was detected by confocal laser scanning microscopy in small bodies that moved through the cytoplasm as it has been described previously for this construct in another independent cell line . in addition a substantial _METHOD_ signal was observed in a reticulate network throughout the cytoplasm that was indistinguishable from the _LOCATION_ network stained by a _METHOD_ hdel construct . to check if _LOCATION_ labeling was due to overexpression of the recombinant proteins by cells _PROTEIN_ mani _METHOD_ were incubated with the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide . after h of treatment the targeting pattern remained unchanged showing that the steady state location of mani _METHOD_ is the _LOCATION_ and the _LOCATION_ . to confirm that _METHOD_ spots were _LOCATION_ stacks the cells were treated for h with of brefeldin a . this bfa treatment caused the green spots to disappear and the cortical and transvascular _LOCATION_ became more _METHOD_ as has been described previously for several _LOCATION_ localized _METHOD_ fusion proteins _PROTEIN_ in tobacco leaf epidermis and by suspension cultured cells . to compare the location of mani to one of the other plant n glycosylation enzymes in the secretory pathway we analyzed under the same conditions the subcellular localization of n glycan maturation enzymes acting before just after mani or much _PROTEIN_ . the first enzyme we studied was arabidopsis gcsi . this type ii _LOCATION_ protein _METHOD_ the first sugar residue from the precursor oligosaccharide in the _LOCATION_ immediately after its attachment to the nascent glycoprotein . the full length protein was fused to _METHOD_ and consistent with what was shown for human gcsi in _PROTEIN_ cells the fusion protein was exclusively located in the _LOCATION_ in by cells . the second candidate investigated was _PROTEIN_ from n. tabacum . this glycosyltransferase adds a first n acetylglucosamine residue on n glycans soon after mani has removed an mannose . the full length protein was fused to _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was _PROTEIN_ in tobacco by suspension cultured cells . interestingly the steady state location of the fusion was the _LOCATION_ and the _LOCATION_ in a pattern very similar to mani _METHOD_ . these data strongly suggest that the n glycan processing enzymes considered to act very early in the _LOCATION_ apparatus such as mani and _PROTEIN_ are targeted to the _LOCATION_ but also to the _LOCATION_ in tobacco by suspension cultured cells . finally the third candidate _PROTEIN_ from arabidopsis was located in the _LOCATION_ only confirming the results from citation who demonstrated that the n terminal end of this enzyme targets _METHOD_ to a medial subset of cisternae of _LOCATION_ stacks . to ascertain whether protein _PROTEIN_ levels might alter localization of our fusion proteins we have confirmed these results in different independent cell lines _PROTEIN_ the fusion proteins at least months after transformation . imaging of cells was always performed on the third or fourth day after subculturing which corresponds to the optimal growth phase under our culture conditions . nevertheless to further validate that _LOCATION_ labeling was not due to overexpression of the fusion we have controlled for each fusion that the labeling pattern was unchanged after a h treatment with cycloheximide . additional data illustrating that translation is indeed blocked under these conditions are available online . protein gel blots revealed with anti _METHOD_ antibodies and the enhanced chemiluminescence staining have shown a very low signal over background for the recombinant proteins indicating a low level of _PROTEIN_ for all fusion proteins in this study . further evidence for a level of fusion protein _PROTEIN_ compatible with a functional nonsaturated secretory pathway was obtained from coexpression experiments when mani _METHOD_ is located both in the _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ in the same cell while a _LOCATION_ marker _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ is found exclusively in the _LOCATION_ . all together results obtained under these carefully controlled conditions clearly show that n glycosylation enzymes are targeted specifically to the _LOCATION_ or to the _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ exclusively but some enzymes have a dual steady state location in both organelles as is the case for mani _PROTEIN_ and other _LOCATION_ proteins such as prolyl hydroxylase and _LOCATION_ . in a next step we decided to investigate which signals were responsible for the targeting of the population of glycosylation enzymes showing a dual steady state distribution _LOCATION_ . recent studies _PROTEIN_ the specific _LOCATION_ retention of the three plant glycosylation enzymes _PROTEIN_ _PROTEIN_ and arabidopsis manii indicate that their specific targeting is mediated by signals contained in their n terminal part including the ct the tmd and the stem for _PROTEIN_ . here we have investigated the role of the luminal domain in the targeting of mani and _PROTEIN_ . to determine if the portion of mani located in the _LOCATION_ lumen plays a role in the targeting of this glycosidase to the _LOCATION_ and the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ the first amino acids or the first amino acids of mani were fused to _METHOD_ and the corresponding chimeric proteins were named _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ respectively . _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ were either stably _PROTEIN_ in by suspension cultured cells or transiently _PROTEIN_ in tobacco leaf epidermal cells by leaf infiltration . both _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ chimeric proteins were observed in the _LOCATION_ and in the _LOCATION_ in both _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ exactly as previously observed for the full length construct . it is important to note that when these truncated fusions were transiently _PROTEIN_ in tobacco leaves the _LOCATION_ labeling was still observed d after transformation when the overall _PROTEIN_ levels are already strongly declining whereas _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was located in the _LOCATION_ only . this further _METHOD_ that the partial location of the mani fusions in the _LOCATION_ is not due to overexpression of the chimeric proteins . in addition when by cells _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were treated with the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide for h the _LOCATION_ labeling did not disappear as had been observed for the full length fusion . to get a better understanding of where the fusion proteins are localized within the _LOCATION_ stacks mani _METHOD_ was coexpressed with the trans _LOCATION_ marker _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ which is derived from _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ by replacing _METHOD_ with the monomeric red _METHOD_ protein _METHOD_ . when the two chimeric proteins were _PROTEIN_ simultaneously in by cells in contrast with mani _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was not detected in the _LOCATION_ and both _METHOD_ signals were observed in _LOCATION_ bodies but did not perfectly colocalize . these results are consistent with previous studies that have demonstrated that the mani _METHOD_ fusion is located in the cis half of the _LOCATION_ in by cells and the n terminal amino acids of rat _PROTEIN_ are sufficient to target a reporter protein predominantly to the trans half of _LOCATION_ stacks . thus confocal microscopy is sufficient to illustrate that mani _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ accumulate in a different subset of cisternae in the _LOCATION_ apparatus . finally when _METHOD_ or _METHOD_ was coexpressed with the trans _LOCATION_ marker _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ the two fluophores only partially overlapped suggesting that the intra _LOCATION_ localization of the truncated fusion proteins was the same as that of the full length fusion mani _METHOD_ . the first n terminal amino acids of the tobacco _PROTEIN_ including the ct the tmd and the stem were previously described to contain the information required to _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ retention of this glycosyltransferase . this polypeptide domain fused to _METHOD_ has been shown to be preferentially located in the _LOCATION_ but the chimeric protein was also detected in the _LOCATION_ as observed here for the full length construct .to determine if the sequence remaining in the _LOCATION_ lumen is involved in the _LOCATION_ and _LOCATION_ targeting of _PROTEIN_ the lumenal part was removed and the remaining first n terminal amino acids of this glycosyltransferase were fused to _METHOD_ . the fusion protein was named _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and stably _PROTEIN_ in by suspension cultured cells or transiently in tobacco leaf epidermal cells . in both _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was located in the _LOCATION_ and in the _LOCATION_ as previously observed for the full length construct _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . in addition when _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ was stably coexpressed with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ in by cells as observed before with _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ the two _METHOD_ spots overlapped but some red _METHOD_ was distinguishable from the yellow suggesting that _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ is not in the trans _LOCATION_ as previously observed for mani . it is clear from these results that the ct and tmd of both mani and _PROTEIN_ are sufficient to target these glycosylation enzymes to their steady state location the _LOCATION_ and the early _LOCATION_ compartments . by contrast the same domain targets _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ to the _LOCATION_ only both in by cells and n. tabacum leaf epidermal cells . the n terminal _LOCATION_ region of many _LOCATION_ bound proteins residing in the mammalian and yeast _LOCATION_ and/or in the _LOCATION_ apparatus contains signals that facilitate either their retrieval from the _LOCATION_ back to the _LOCATION_ or their export from the _LOCATION_ to the _LOCATION_ . in plants the length of cts can vary widely between the different glycosidases and glycosyltransferases . for instance gcsi and mani contain a long ct . in comparison the cts of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ are only composed of amino acids . to define more precisely the targeting signal of mani and to investigate the role of the relatively long cytoplasmic domain of this glycosidase in this targeting we generated two fusion proteins _METHOD_ _METHOD_ . in the latter two proteins amino acids were removed so that the ct was shortened down to amino acids like the cts of _PROTEIN_ and _PROTEIN_ . this truncation removed a potential dibasic motif that might function in _LOCATION_ to _LOCATION_ transport although another potential _LOCATION_ export signal remained . a complete removal of the ct was attempted _METHOD_ but it was not possible to get this fusion protein _PROTEIN_ in tobacco cells . to look for a targeting determinant in the remaining amino acids of the ct the ct sequence was substituted by an artificial sequence _METHOD_ . this artificial sequence does not contain any known targeting sequences and does not affect the length of the hydrophobic tmd . the three constructs _METHOD_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ were _PROTEIN_ in tobacco cells . the two latter labeled the _LOCATION_ and the _LOCATION_ just like the constructs from which they originate . in addition the fusion protein containing an artificial maaa ct was located in the same compartments indicating that the n terminal _LOCATION_ region is not necessary for mani targeting consequently all information required for its steady state localization to both the _LOCATION_ and the _LOCATION_ apparatus is contained within the amino acids of the _METHOD_ construct . according to the _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ model the distribution of n glycan maturation enzymes in the secretory pathway is based on the length of their tmds . the _LOCATION_ of the secretory pathway organelles increase in _PROTEIN_ from the _LOCATION_ to the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ . the _LOCATION_ and the cis _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ are only to nm _PROTEIN_ whereas the _LOCATION_ of the trans _LOCATION_ the secretory vesicles and the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ are to nm _PROTEIN_ . moreover targeting related to tmd length was previously illustrated by studying the location of reporter proteins after varying the length of their tmd in animal _METHOD_ and for type i proteins also in plant cells . this implies that the _LOCATION_ of a specific compartment can only accommodate hydrophobic tmds of the matching length . in this study we have shown that the information required for mani targeting is contained within a amino acid sequence including the amino acid tmd . to investigate whether the length of the tmd could play a key role in the targeting of this type ii _LOCATION_ protein in the early plant secretory pathway we designed two fusion proteins _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ where the tmd of mani was lengthened from to amino acids by duplication of its last seven amino acids . _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ were _PROTEIN_ in by suspension cultured cells and in tobacco leaf epidermal cells . in both plant _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ were exclusively located in bright spots and were sensitive to the fungal toxin bfa . the _PROTEIN_ patterns of _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ were similar to either the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion or the _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusion both located exclusively in the _LOCATION_ in by suspension cultured cells and tobacco leaf epidermal cells as has been confirmed previously by electron microscopy . similar results were obtained in other plant _METHOD_ used for transient _PROTEIN_ . indeed _METHOD_ was located in the _LOCATION_ and in the _LOCATION_ in soybean and in tomato leaf epidermal cells whereas _METHOD_ was found almost exclusively in the _LOCATION_ in both _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . to further investigate the subcompartmentation of _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ stable by suspension cultured cells coexpressing one or the other of these _METHOD_ fusions and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were established . in the merged images it was impossible to separate green spots from red spots suggesting that the _METHOD_ fusions containing a amino acid tmd have moved forward within the _LOCATION_ toward the trans face so that they colocalize with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ at the confocal level . interestingly the spot patterns were similar in cortical images compared with cross sections reinforcing the assumption that the man _METHOD_ fusions with a longer tmd and the trans _LOCATION_ marker _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ perfectly colocalize . by contrast the medial _LOCATION_ marker _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and the trans _LOCATION_ marker _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ resulted in _METHOD_ spots that did not overlap perfectly in the merged image . electron microscopy coupled to immunogold labeling with polyclonal anti _METHOD_ antibodies allowed us to determine more precisely the intra _LOCATION_ localization of these fusion proteins . as illustrated in figure the _METHOD_ fusion accumulated _PROTEIN_ to the cis side of the _LOCATION_ whereas the _METHOD_ fusions are principally localized to the trans side of the _LOCATION_ . similar results were obtained with mani _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ . control experiments using the preimmune serum or wild type tobacco by suspension cultured cells showed no or very little nonspecific _LOCATION_ labeling . in conclusion together these results indicate that tmd length plays a key role in the targeting of mani to the _LOCATION_ and the cis _LOCATION_ compartments and an increase in the length of the tmd from to amino acids relocates this type ii _LOCATION_ protein further downstream toward the trans face of the _LOCATION_ . taking advantage of the large panel of _LOCATION_ marker generated during this study we have investigated the possibility that _LOCATION_ proteins located in different _LOCATION_ subcompartments may behave differently after bfa treatment . cells _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ soluble or _LOCATION_ markers _METHOD_ _METHOD_ the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ marker _METHOD_ the medial _LOCATION_ marker _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ or the _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ marker _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were treated with bfa for h. at the end of the bfa treatment all the fusion proteins accumulated in bright aggregates and in the _LOCATION_ except for the _LOCATION_ markers that were never found in aggregates . we illustrate here that all markers relocated in the _LOCATION_ in presence of bfa . in cells coexpressing _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ or _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ proteins with _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ bfa induces the redistribution of both markers into the _LOCATION_ and into _LOCATION_ aggregates except for _METHOD_ hdel and _METHOD_ that were not found in the aggregates . in some cases there are subtle differences in timing but these are not trivial to detect and also not informative with respect to intra _LOCATION_ localization . furthermore no significant difference was observed in the _METHOD_ patterns observed after bfa treatment of cells _PROTEIN_ either a soluble _METHOD_ or a _LOCATION_ protein _METHOD_ marker . to determine whether the tmd length could be the only _LOCATION_ sorting determinant allowing the subcompartmentation of all glycosidases and glycosyltransferases along the plant secretory system we compared the n terminal sequences of characterized glycosylation enzymes . this analysis is hampered by the small number of sequences of different enzymes cloned and functionally characterized from a single species as well as a still smaller number of electron microscopy data to correlate tmd lengths and _LOCATION_ _PROTEIN_ in a single plant system . in silico analysis of the n terminal sequence of all plant glycosylation enzymes cloned so far clearly shows a trend for longer tmds in proteins with the most downstream location in the _LOCATION_ stacks . for instance it is interesting to note that none of the enzymes that are supposed to be located in the _PROTEIN_ _LOCATION_ such as fucosyltransferases and fucosyltransferases have a tmd shorter than amino acids . these results are confirmed when the phobius or _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ are used for tmd length prediction . however exceptions to this general trend can be noticed when similar glycosylation enzymes from different species are compared for example the mani tmds ranging from to amino acids . based on its short amino acid tmd that could perfectly fit with the lipid bilayer model to explain its localization in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ we have selected gcsi to check for general applicability of this model . to define whether the tmd of gcsi was sufficient for its targeting and retention in the _LOCATION_ we first deleted most of the luminal part of this glycosidase and fused its first n terminal amino acids to _METHOD_ to get the fusion protein _METHOD_ . when this fusion was _PROTEIN_ in tobacco cells the _LOCATION_ was highlighted in a pattern very similar to the one obtained with the full length construct gcsi _METHOD_ and the _METHOD_ hdel construct . this result clearly shows that gcsi targeting to the _LOCATION_ depends on signals located within the ct the tmd and/or the luminal amino acids remaining in this truncated protein . in a further attempt at defining the minimal protein sequence required for localization of gcsi in the _LOCATION_ we deleted the first n terminal amino acids from the _METHOD_ construct to obtain _METHOD_ . when this fusion was _PROTEIN_ in tobacco suspension cultured or leaf epidermal cells the chimeric protein was located exclusively in _LOCATION_ like spots as observed for _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . in conclusion the amino acid long tmd of gcsi is not sufficient to target this glycosidase in the _LOCATION_ _LOCATION_ and additional information contained in the first amino acids of the ct is required for the normal localization of this glycosylation enzyme in the secretory system . this result provides experimental proof that _PROTEIN_ other than tmd length can influence the positioning of glycosylation enzymes in the early secretory pathway .
all mani fusion constructs were derived from the full length _METHOD_ fusion _METHOD_ originally described by citation . first a linker containing an aatii restriction site was introduced between the mani and the _METHOD_ coding regions . in combination with the native aatii site near the end of the predicted stem region this allowed for simple removal of the catalytic domain to yield _METHOD_ . second to facilitate the removal of specific segments of the n terminal region three new restriction sites were introduced by pcr mutagenesis one nhei site immediately behind the start codon one spei site at codons and and another aatii site at codons and . the integrity of the modified construct was confirmed by sequencing . in this new construct the ct could be removed with nhei and spei to give _METHOD_ while an aatii digest would remove the entire lumenal part of mani to yield _METHOD_ . combination of the two procedures resulted in _METHOD_ . finally forward _PROTEIN_ and reverse oligonucleotides encoding the amino acids of the tmd domain with a start codon were synthesized fused and subcloned into the binary vector containing the _METHOD_ without any start codon to give _METHOD_ . the same strategy has been used to generated _METHOD_ using forward _PROTEIN_ and reverse primers . third a longer tmd region was introduced in a two step pcr mutagenesis of the modified mani described above . in the first step the aatii site following the tmd was replaced with a bspei site . in the second step a long pcr primer was used to duplicate the last seven amino acids of the predicted tmd to yield _METHOD_ . finally the catalytic domain of this construct was removed with aatii to give _METHOD_ . all cloning steps described above were performed in pbluescript sk . the finished _PROTEIN_ cassettes were then moved to . to obtain the plant binary vector encoding _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _METHOD_ was replaced with _METHOD_ in _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ is under control of tandemly repeated camv promoters . _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ were amplified by pcr using the nicotiana tabacum cdna encoding n _PROTEIN_ as template . reverse primers ggtcactagtatcttcatttccgagttg and ggtcactagtgcgatctgcatattctgactg were used for pcr with the forward primer aacgtctagaatgagagggtacaagttttgc to amplify the _PROTEIN_ and the n terminal amino acid end of the _PROTEIN_ to obtain _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ respectively . to _PROTEIN_ gcsi _METHOD_ the total cdna was amplified by pcr using arabidopsis thaliana cdna cloned as by citation fused at the n terminal end of _METHOD_ and subcloned in . then the first amino acids were amplified by pcr with forward and reverse primers and subcloned in the spei restriction site located at the end of _METHOD_ contained in the binary vector to give _METHOD_ . in the same way the amino acids deleted of the first amino acids were amplified by pcr with forward primer and the same reverse primers as above to give _METHOD_ . _METHOD_ _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ fusions were transferred into agrobacterium tumefaciens by heat shock . transgenic agrobacterium were selected onto yeb medium containing kanamycin and gentamycin and were used to transform n. tabacum cells as described by citation . transformed tobacco cells were selected in the presence of kanamycin for _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ fusions or hygromycin for _METHOD_ and cefotaxime . for the double transformants coexpressing _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ fusions microcalli were first selected onto kanamycin plates and were then transferred onto hygromycin plates . after screening calli _PROTEIN_ the _METHOD_ and or _METHOD_ fusions were used to initiate suspension cultures of transgenic cells . three to four day old by suspension cultured cells were used for experiments . agrobacterium was cultured at until the stationary phase washed and resuspended in infiltration medium _PROTEIN_ . the bacterial suspension was pressure injected into the abaxial epidermis of n. tabacum g. max or s. lycopersicum leaves using a ml plastic syringe by pressing the nozzle against the lower leaf epidermis . the plants were incubated for d at to unless specified in the figure legend . for tomato and soybean the same transformation procedure was followed but the cells were observed after d. tobacco cells were incubated in cycloheximide for h or bfa for h before confocal analysis _METHOD_ . cells _PROTEIN_ _METHOD_ fusions were imaged using a leica tcs _PROTEIN_ confocal laser scanning microscope . single color imaging of _METHOD_ was done using a nm argon ion laser line and the _METHOD_ was recorded by a photomultiplier set up for to nm . dual color imaging of cells coexpressing _METHOD_ and _METHOD_ was performed using simultaneously a nm argon ion laser line and a hene nm laser line . _METHOD_ signals were separated using an acousto optical beam splitter and _METHOD_ emission was detected in photomultiplier whereas _METHOD_ was collected in photomultiplier . the power of each laser line the gain and the offset were identical for each experiment so that the images were comparable . appropriate controls were performed to exclude the possibility of crosstalk between the two fluorochromes before the image acquisition . immunolabeling was performed on cryosections of d old by suspension cultured cells fixed in a mixture of formaldehyde and glutaraldehyde for h embedded in gelatin and infiltrated with m sucrose . the cells were then frozen in liquid nitrogen and sectioned at . grids were floated in successive solutions at room temperature for min . they were first incubated in _PROTEIN_ buffer containing glycin to inactivate residual fixative . the grids were blocked in _PROTEIN_ buffer with bsa and then incubated with the anti _METHOD_ antibodies diluted in blocking buffer for min . after washing in _PROTEIN_ buffer the grids were blocked in normal goat serum in _PROTEIN_ buffer containing bsa . after incubation with the secondary antibody diluted in blocking buffer for min the grids were incubated with glutaraldehyde in _PROTEIN_ for min and finally washed in water . the specimen were stained for min with cold methyl cellulose containing uranyl acetate ph and observed with a transmission electron microscope . sequence data of the genes from this article
